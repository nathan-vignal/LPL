R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Ah, this is Alex.
R:  This is Tina.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine thank you.  I'm sorry.  This is, um, you know, um, my second time [LAUGH] doing this.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's w- -- it's my third.  So --
L:  Oh, your third?
R:  -- it's not really --
L:  Oh, well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're done then. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I will be done. [LAUGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Where are you at?
R:  Michigan
L:  Michigan?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Toronto.
R:  Oh, Toronto?  Okay.
L:  Mhm.  Just on the other side of the lake. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, all right.  Um --
L:  Okay.  I guess we're supposed to talk to about the, ah, September eleven things?
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  Have you made any changes?
L:  Um, I'd say not really because, ah, I guess, you know, it's because we live here in Canada.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The only changes, um, is, ah, I guess, um, you know, I'm a little bit more scared now.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but that's about it.  But also, um, the September eleven has, um, I guess, um, made me more aware of my loved ones.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I guess, like, day to day life, I haven't really changed much.  But, like you say, it -- it -- it op- --
L:  Oh, really?  And you're in the States?
R:  Yeah.  Because it just doesn't really -- I mean, I guess there was more towards when it actually occurred but I think enough time has past.  And I really didn't change my lifestyle too much.  I guess I -- I looked over my shoulder a little more if I was gonna be flying on an airplane or something [LAUGH] but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Well -- well, that's another thing.  We're more scared now too, ah, fly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't even want to go anywhere, ah, near a airplane [LAUGH] right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I flew for the first time a few months ago and, um, I was a little --
L:  How did you feel?
R:  -- a little fearful of it but it was, you know -- it was fine and -- my -- my philosophy has been, you know, I think we had a better chance of giving a problem before because we were so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lax in our security.  Um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I think as a country, we just became overconfident in our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in our security and now we're r- -- we were, sort of, had an eye opener and now, I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things are real strict and so I feel better almost. [LAUGH] Because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because they're so careful about all the [inaudible].
L:  Well, I'm just curious, how do you feel about your government now?
R:  Um, I think --
L:  Because of wa- -- what has happened and, I guess, ah, also, um, ah, what they've done in Iraq?
R:  I actually think that ...  Most of everything that's gone on I'm in support of.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think, um --
L:  Even the war in Iraq?
R:  Ah, I was -- obviously, nobody really wants to have a war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I supported the reasons behind it and the, um --
L:  D- do you still believe those reasons now?  Um --
R:  Mm ...
L:  You know, um, now that, ah, we're hearing all these things, um -- um, they have not found any --
R:  Weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Blah, blah, blah.  Um, [LAUGH] I guess --
L:  I'm n- not [LAUGH] trying to put you on the spot.  It's just that, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's -- you're --
L:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm curious to how -- as how to, ah, people there, um, think.  Ah --
R:  Well, to be honest --
L:  As for me, I'm -- I've --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- always the supported the -- the States.  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  But, um --
R:  To be honest, I -- I stopped -- you know when we were in a -- we aren't in the, like -- the hole throes of the heavy part of the war, I stopped paying as much attention.  I think that's part of just -- that's my fault because I don't really know exactly what's going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the time.  I'm not a big news buff or whatever.  Um, but I -- I think that it was, a -- a -- something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I wish we would've done right the first time.  We would've, you know, not had such a -- let such a bad guy be in t- -- in power and he was not -- he was really horrible.  So, [LAUGH] I'm, kinda, glad he's not in power anymore.  I think it's better for the country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um --
L:  Well, I'm happy that he was out there but, um --
R:  Yeah.  But i- it was a --
L:  Ah, what bothers me, I think --
R:  -- very controversial --
L:  -- is, um -- um, the lies that might be behind it.  If there are really no weapons of, um, mass destruction then -- then --
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I don't know.  Yeah.
L:  The way I'm hearing now, um, even from, um, people from your own government, they're saying that, um, there was never, ever any evidence --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- of it. [LAUGH]
R:  I think you'll f- -- you'll find a group to support any, um, side of the story that you want.  And [LAUGH] you know -- and I think that's true in almost anything.
L:  I mean, don't get me wrong --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I w- -- um, you know -- I was happy, ah, to hear, ah, when George Bush was elected.  I am a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- born again Christian and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I thought, you know, that's, kind of, a -- a step in the right direction.  Ah --
R:  Yeah.  His more conservative views.
L:  But -- but when you hear these things, you know, [LAUGH] it makes you wonder.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't feel, like -- I don't know.  My gut tells me that he -- no, he wouldn't have -- of --
L:  E- --
R:  -- done this for no reason.
L:  Or no reason so --
R:  And --
L:  -- that i- i- it's not just, um, you know, because of the election as, ah, what his attractors, um, want to say, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I still think that he genuinely felt there was a threat because there's a lotta people who still genuinely feel there's a threat.  Just because we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- haven't found them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- doesn't mean they're not there.
L:  They're not there.
R:  Or have been destroyed.  Ah --
L:  Well, personally, I think that, um, Saddam Hussein, um, is smarter than, ah, you know, what e- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than everyone thinks.  And I -- he probably a- -- had moved them out to, um --
R:  Who knows where?  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, to Syria or even Iran for that matter, you know?
R:  He was -- he was a very formidable threat and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I'm glad that we had a president who had --
L:  Who c- -- who stands up.
R:  -- the courage to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- stand up to that.  But, um --
L:  But again, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's also, ah, because of his background, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or his upbringing.  Um --
R:  Yeah.  He's --
L:  Um --
R:  He doesn't take any grief.  But [LAUGH] --
L:  The -- the Bible teaches you to stand up for what you believe in.  What you -- what is right so -- you know?
R:  And for those who can't.  I mean, he really s- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- stood up for those -- the poor people in Iraq that were so oppressed and, ah, I just -- I still have confidence in him.  I -- I just -- like I said, I fell out of the news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- circle after [LAUGH] a while [LAUGH] but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I followed it more closely when we were actually in the war and I think people, um, did, um, underestimate these types of tyrants power and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ability to do -- like, same thing with Osama.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Who would've thought, you know -- we, kind of, knew he had been thinking of this, kind of, a plan.  You know, attacking the United States with the airplanes.  But we were so overconfident.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we --
L:  Well, I just hope that when they do find him, they don't do the, um -- um, the Muammar Gaddafi type of thing that they've done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where they had him in sight and then turned away from him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hope when they find Osama, they really get rid of him.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because of what he has done.  'Cause, um, a- another thing that, ah, September eleven also has, um -- like, it made an impact on me when -- when it happened -- it was so fresh, um, ah, I ended up, um, writing a poem.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- I guess that was the beginning of, um -- o- of a new hobby for me.  I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- managed to, ah, write, um -- um, ah, Christian poems and I never knew I could.
R:  Right.  It -- so --
L:  You know?
R:  -- that, sort of, brought out that, ah, outlet for you?
L:  That s- -- that side of me.  Yes.
R:  Mhm.  That's interesting.
L:  And -- and it's a poem that, um, you know, um, I -- I posted even on the internet and had, um, many response --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- from it and, ah, ASAM[?], even asked me if they could, ah, copy it and distribute it and I said, "By all means".  You know, they're --
R:  Yeah.  'Cause you want that to be heard.
L:  Um, they're mostly -- they're mostly Christian poems so, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's all about sharing.  So, I -- I was happy.
R:  Th- that's great.
L:  You know?
R:  I mean, it's nice that -- that --
L:  Something positive c- --
R:  -- sort of, made a positive change in you.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  And not just the fear.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, but -- yeah.  I think it is a very scary time.  We found out that these people hate us enough to do such things like that and that's scary.
L:  And, you know, that's one thing I never understood with the, um -- with their religion is, um, how, um, ah -- how they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they promote violence against, ah, another human being.
R:  Well, it's --
L:  I --
R:  It's not the --
L:  It just [SIGH] --
R:  -- religion.  It's their [SIGH] -- because their religion is a peaceful religion.  But it's that --
L:  Well, that's what everyone says --
R:  It's -- but it's --
L:  -- but then, you know --
R:  -- that sect.  It's that, um, rebellious a- -- I mean, they go against the teachings of their religion.  They think they're fighting for their religion but they're not.  They're delusional.  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Maybe it's because I'm a born again Christian that -- that's why I look at it differently.
R:  Well, I'm a -- I'm a --
L:  I -- I don't --
R:  -- Christian as well and I -- I don't say I agree --
L:  But --
R:  -- with it but I do know --
L:  M- --
R:  -- [NOISE] that they do preach peace.
L:  But I think that it's that religion that brings that out, ah, of them.
R:  Yeah.  B- -- [SIGH] --
L:  Because if they did not have that religion, I don't think they would have the hatred that they do for Christians.
R:  Yeah.  B- -- and also --
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  We've had some pretty nasty Christians in the past too.  I mean, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- think so but then, ah --
R:  Christianity brings out people's -- so many wars have been fought in the name of Christianity.  It's, like [LAUGH] --
L:  But I -- I -- I don't believe that there are Christians out there who, um -- who guns for, um -- for other people, um, believing differently than -- than they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I certainly don't.  And I -- I don't know any --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Christian, personally, who goes out, ah, hunting down, um, those, ah --
R:  Well, not now.  But in --
L:  -- who believe otherwise.
R:  But in our history, there have been many wars fought over, you know, Catholic church versus another church, you know? [LAUGH] That's --
L:  Right.
R:  That's the history.  I mean, the -- the Christian church has been, kinda, violent in that way too but I think if the -- if anybody takes their religion and they interpret it incorrectly and they don't think of the true --
L:  They won't --
