L:  Earl.
R:  Morning, my name's Sylvia.
L:  Oh hi, Sylvia, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  Who are you?
L:  Earl.  I'm calling about, um --
R:  Earl, is that what you think?
L:  Yeah, salaries by, um, professional athletes --
R:  Uh-huh.  What do you think?
L:  And -- oh, well, uh, I mean, there's so many, um, salaries out there by professional athletes, um, you know, I do feel that they do deserve and, uh, [SIGH] you know, should get paid what they're worth but, I mean, it's kind of a wide, uh, ballpark figure that you -- you know, it's pretty hard to determine, you know, who's better than who, I mean, there is a lot of, uh, professional athletes out there, um, you know, whether they come from high school or whether they come from college, um, you know, if, uh, really to determined, uh, the factor is, you know, who deserves -- who gets more than who.  Um, you know, it could just be a wide, uh, variety of things, um, you know, some get paid less, some get paid more for their, um, you know, their successful outcome and their natural ability.  And, um -- so, you know, to me it could be a wide variety of, uh, you know, in the salary wise, uh, professional athletes, um, you know, some get paid more, some get less, some get paid more, um, not always just on natural ability, could depend on the team or their first year, second year, uh, third year, you know, whatever the case may be.  Uh, you know, some teams are better than others, you know, some athletes they go to particular teams just because they like teams, some of them go, um, for the money, some go just for the simple fact is, um, you know, just, uh, wherever they -- you know, wherever they can get, you know, drafted.  Wherever, whatever the case may be.  But, um, you know, me it's a personal thing [NOISE] and, um, you know, I -- I think there should be a -- you know, both a high and a low -- low ball, you know, figure that everyone should start out with, uh, equally so that way you don't -- you know, everybody has equal opportunity because, you know, this is two thousand and three, we are equal opportunity, uh, and, you know, a lot of society is predicated on that so I feel that, you know, everyone should start out semi the same but, I mean, it -- it's pretty hard to determine and judge, um, that aspect for professional athletes on who deserves the higher salary, who deserves the lower salary, so, um, you know, I don't really have a good, I would say, hundred and ten percent, you know, clue on how to determine or even just at the -- you know, basically, I mean, to me, I would just regulate it, you know, everyone should start out semi the same, um, you know, but of course, I mean, they can't, you know, can't pay someone more, you know, whether they -- no matter what kind of natural ability they have, um, you know, it depends on the team if they -- you know, if they won anything recently or they haven't, um, you know, just depends on the case and -- and most professional athletes, uh, do go, I mean, you know, that's all they done, you know.  They've lived, eat and sleeped this probably since, you know, whether it be grade school [NOISE], high school, what that's, you know, all they done so therefore, you know, grounds, uh, that's what I meant by, you know, should start out semi, you know, the same so there's no conflict and you don't have any -- such as strikes, things like that.  Um, you know, or -- or requesting, uh, more money because you could be a good athlete and you might be getting paid, uh, you know, less and you should be -- if you can't get traded to another team, you can't get out of your contract or, um, you know, bas- whatever the case may be, I mean, there could be a wide variety of -- number of things and, you know, my -- which we don't have that much anyways, uh, strikes or anything but it's like all businesses, you know, you know not to discuss your, you know, salary, whatever with other team mates, uh, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I suppose, just like you see small teams that, um, you -- I mean, you can pretty much -- I mean, I can't -- I can't speak for everyone and make that common judgment but, you know, you can pretty well tell who's getting the most salary than others but it's still a little bit more than the average person and what they've had -- and what they had before.  And what would you feel your input would be on that?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I'm -- I'm wondering, are you an athlete?  Have -- have you done sports yourself?
L:  No --
R:  No.
L:  -- I haven't done sports myself but, I mean --
R:  I -- what I think generally is, uh, um, the market determines the prices we pay and we as -- as a population, um, show what we think things are worth by supporting those salaries so we don't pay teachers very much and we do pay movie stars a lot and -- and -- and we buy tickets to movies and sports events and we, um, don't pay taxes a lot for education and that's a decision that society makes.  So, um --
L:  Right, and that's what, like you're saying, yeah, you're right.  And the other should be other things that, uh, should be paid more and paid more attention to, um, like you said, yeah, we're judged by, uh -- you know, not always but, you know, vehicle we drive, um, where we live and, um, you know, kind the economical things there's, you know, what kind of job we have and where we live.  And, uh, yeah, you're a hundred and ten percent right.  Now, salary, I mean, it -- it's pretty hard to [SIGH], you know, determine and judge 'cause a lot of people, you know, they have different aspects, um, for society for, um, you know, for what, uh, [MN] we should be and not be just like, uh -- you know, or you could have, uh, that's all you know and you have, uh, you know, whether the parent, spouse, grandparents whoever it may be and that's not something I, you know, care to elaborate on today but, you know, that -- you know, uh, maybe you should be getting more or you should be getting less just because, um, and, you know, I might -- it could be there dream or it could not be just -- I mean, of course, if that's all you know then, you know, you're not going to know any different just like now, you know, these kids are doing computers [NOISE] and, I mean -- well, I mean, of course the time they get, you know, in the twelfth grade if they've been doing it, you know, daily whatever the case may be, I mean, of course they're gonna be good at it [MN].  You know, that -- that's all they see and know.  So --
R:  Well, I think -- I think it's really none of my business whether they strike or don't strike and the way that I can, um, express my opinions is buying tickets or not buying tickets and -- and -- and if peo- if fans are discouraged by the behavior of the athletes --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they will stop buying tickets and that will ch- change the behavior.  I -- I don't think that there's any --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anything else [NOISE] that needs to be done, except that.
L:  Right.  Exactly, I mean, I don't really feel there is much that needs to be done but --
R:  I surely wouldn't want to see any legislation or any -- any public -- any -- any [NOISE] kind of legal control over what people do or didn't do.
L:  Right, exactly, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- yeah, I wouldn't want to see any legal control, I mean, 'cause otherwise you just wouldn't have anybody playing [LAUGH].  I mean, you wouldn't have a lot, you know, 'cause, you know, too regulated to do -- you gotta do this, gotta do that, can't do this, can do this and -- but, yeah, you're right there's no way to determine if, um -- you know, you could have, uh, like you said, you know, you can express opinion by whether buying tickets or you choose not to buy tickets and you can have a good player on a team -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, say, you could have a Michael Jordan on another team --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and don't even know it because he's not getting the recognition and not so much the notoriety and he's not receiving the higher salary just because it's not a good team, I mean, you know that's just what happened when the -- you know, when he got accepted or he or she got accepted when, you know, the draft pick, you know, came down.  That they needed, you know, basically it might have been a semi last resort.  But, I mean, ot- other than that, I mean, you're -- you're right, there's no [SIGH] -- none of -- it's none of our business in the first place and who gets the higher salary or not, I mean, yeah, I wouldn't wanna see any +legislation, you know, on that to -- to be regulated.  I don't feel that it should be, I mean, I feel so far, you know, they are doing pretty -- me fine with it, you know.  Uh, you know, ninety five percent, um, it's just that, um ...
