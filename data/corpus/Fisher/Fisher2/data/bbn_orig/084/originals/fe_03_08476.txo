L:  Hello?  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm -- my name is Erica.
L:  I'm Stephie.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've never done one of these before, I --
L:  Oh, all we have to do is sit here and talk about what they said -- about if we think that the pe -- the -- the -- the -- sports --
R:  The professionals?
L:  -- yeah, yeah, that's it -- should be able to go on strike for more money.
R:  Okay, um --
L:  No --
R:  -- I don't think that they should.
L:  No, I don't either, they get paid way more mo- money than they --
R:  Yeah, they get --
L:  -- should get.
R:  Yeah, they definitely get paid way too much money.
L:  That's not -- not ...
R:  And, all that they do is play the sports like anyone else, so ... um ... ah ...
L:  [several inaudible words] I know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they give you a topic and it's an easy one.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  I think it's --
R:  -- well, they're, I mean, I just think that they're just like anyone else and they're just playing a sport, and they're just, like, being watched on TV, but --
L:  Yeah, it's not a big deal.
R:  -- I mean, but actr- -- actors and actresses get paid just as much money, and they don't really do anything --
L:  They don't really do anything, you know? 
R:  They don't really do anything.
L:  I mean, not that people aren't professionals.
R:  And the rest of us are sitting here, and we don't make anything [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and they can -- and they can get in trouble with the law, and you know, just, well, you know, write it off.
R:  Right, yeah, like, Koby Bryan who's trying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you -- you know -- do you know about that whole thing?
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's bull.
R:  And, he's trying to say that, you know, he didn't do anything wrong, just because he's a professional, and ...
L:  But, then again, it could also be the girl's just saying it, because he's a professional.
R:  Right, and they want to --
L:  And she ...
R:  -- get more involved because he has such a big name and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he has --
L:  If it was any other person that, you know, and we were -- only the people in that State would hear about it, we wouldn't be hearing about it.
R:  Right, there wouldn't be as much publicity as everything else, because they are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, hired for what they do, and 'cause they have [inaudible] --
L:  They get money for ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  They get money for something every and any person can do if they, you know, try hard enough.
R:  Right, exactly, like, you know, it's just like the training and, um, anyone could train for it, you know, starting as an amateur and then you just move on, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you get better as you process, so ...
L:  They shouldn't get paid as much money as they do.
R:  No [LAUGH].
L:  I think I do more work than they do chasing a one year old around [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Is that what -- what do you do?
L:  Ah, I stay at home with my son.
R:  Oh, okay, I'm just a student, so I have no money.
L:  Oh, well same.
R:  I'll have some of the money that they make [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, see, you're going to school so that you can make money [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, exactly, you know, I -- I struggle and I try to learn as much as I can, so make -- to try to make a decent salary when I graduate, and ...
L:  [MN]
R:  Um ...
L:  Not very fair that they're making thousands of dollars to do nothing, pretty much.
R:  Yeah, and they ha- -- they're not even on [inaudible] -- they're only on TV for, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a few months out of the year and the times they're just practising and living the luxurious life that they have.
L:  And they get paid to do it.
R:  Right.
L:  I could do that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'll --
R:  Anyone can.
L:  I'll learn how to play basketball if that's what I get.
R:  Yeah, baseball, so [MN] ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] Hang on a minute -- hello? [NOISE] [MN] Yeah, this is me, um, can -- can I call you back in like five minutes?  [NOISE] It'll be five minutes, I'm just trying to get my son to sleep [NOISE] -- bye -- [NOISE] wa- -- oh, yeah, that'll work, um, okay, I'm sorry -- yeah -- [NOISE] whoops, wait a minute -- I'm sorry -- four, three, five, what? -- [NOISE] two, two, five, three [NOISE] -- okay, thank you, bye. [NOISE] Sorry about that, it's, ah --
R:  It's okay, it's okay.
L:  Got seven phones in the house, and three of 'em are ringing, you know? 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um ... [MN] ...
L:  There's -- there's not really much else to say about the subject.
R:  Right, I mean, we just don't think that it's fair --
L:  No.
R:  -- I guess we just also -- [NOISE] because we're women --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, I don't know, I'm -- I'm very into sports, I -- I  --
L:  See, I'm not.
R:  -- I think -- I think it's entertaining, I -- I like watching -- I like basketball, I like hockey, but that's really it -- I don't really -- I mean, it's entertaining, keeps you busy, social, but other than that I don't really care who wins anything [NOISE] -- stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, you can go down to a local playground and watch --
R:  Baseball --
L:  -- kids play.
R:  -- yeah, exactly, exactly [NOISE] -- but it's, you know ...
L:  And they're not getting paid for it.
R:  Right, exactly, it's a whole scam.
L:  We're only on five minutes.
R:  Really?
L:  Yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do they time you until it -- or ...
L:  They ti- -- they time you ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes, so ...
L:  The last conversation I had -- [MN] the last survey I had to take, it was about, if you wanted, oh, if you're -- if you think a school has a right to tell what -- [MN] the -- the books your children can and can't read [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  I've never done this, I don't -- I've just signed up for it, so -- I think it's cool, I mean, you make ten bucks [LAUGH].
L:  Sometimes more, depending on the length of the survey.
R:  Oh, all right, well, [MN] else could we give them for our topic?  [LAUGH] Um ... I don't know if you notice, like, back in the day if they -- if they got as much money for the sports --
L:  No, they didn't.
R:  -- as they do they now.
L:  Not at all.
R:  So, when did it [several inaudible words] like increase, or ...?  
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I guess like, the more popularity -- [MN] --
L:  Yeah, the more popular it came, but more money they made, they more money they asked for.
R:  Like, the more demand, the more -- the more people that, um, the more people that watch and like, they also -- they're paid from the TV stations, because, well, they get -- 'cause they air the -- the programs.
L:  Or, then they'll wear a certain sneaker and they'll get money for that --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- come on now.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] the advertising this Nikes, um --
L:  If I wear Nikes, can I get paid to wear 'em?
R:  Right, exactly, 'cause they're right on the court, you know, they get paid more money, 'cause they -- they're advertising for Nike also.
L:  I think that's bull crap.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree.
L:  That really is bull crap. 
R:  Yep, um ...
L:  [SIGH] I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know [LAUGH].  Um ...
L:  Everytime I've had a survey it's always me and a person agree, so there's like, no debate about it.
R:  I know, this is annoying.  What else?
L:  How is this helping Fisher Price?
R:  I don't know.  I have no idea.
L:  I wonder if -- maybe they'll get back to me, and let me know.
R:  I have no idea [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH].
R:  Um, what else, oh, then um, they also have, ah, action figures with all the sports --
L:  Oh, yeah, and ah, [MN] you can get the stuffed animals, and the --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- all kinds of bull.
R:  -- the stuffed animals and action figures, and, um --
L:  [inaudible] [MN] --
R:  -- you know, they have everything with the logos, and also there's clothing with people's names and like, I know that my brother is, um -- he's bidding on like, a, um, one of the new players who just got drafted for the NBA, he's bidding on a jersey that's like, you know, an authentic jersey, that's what makes that so special, you know?  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you want -- you want to wear their name on your back, and they're just, you know, a regular Joe like anyone else.
L:  Mm [SIGH] -- it's --
R:  So, I think that's pretty funny.
L:  And so many people are making money off of them.
R:  [NOISE] Right, yeah, and then they're selling it for more money, and they're profiting and everyone's profiting from that.
L:  And us poor people are, you know, losing money [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yep, just -- the rich get richer, and the poor [NOISE] get poorer.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What else is there?  You know, then also some of these -- these players, they grew up in po- -- they grew up in poverty, you know, and I know for the basketball players, they just grew up on the streets and, you know, they um, the profits --
L:  Yeah, but just because they did that, they shouldn't be making as much money as they did.
R:  Right, that's -- right, that's true.  They shouldn't be making as much as they do, because they just, [NOISE] um ...
L:  They're playing basketball, or football.
R:  You know, they don't -- they also don't have the intelligence [several inaudible words] --
L:  Look at all the college students playing, and they're not getting paid for it -- they have to pay to play.
R:  Right, and then, you know, they get their scholarships from playing, and you know, that's how some people get through their college, and ... what else?  Hm, hm, hm --
L:  I think it's -- I mean, you got, you -- you can have, like, a rich family, but yet, if they -- if they're a great basketball player they get a scholarship to the school -- where you got a poor family who can't even afford to go to college --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and are financial aid, and begging people for money, and ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  You know, and if you have one talent, then you can play --
L:  [MN] But yet -- but yet, you're smarter than they are.
R:  Right, yeah, but then, like, if you brought the talent, like with the baseball talent, you know, they don't have any intelligence and they're -- right, what you just said, the families who have the intelligence and they have no money -- they have to struggle.
L:  Yeah, that's just -- they wonder why many kids don't go to college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause they don't have the money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you're not good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if they're pretty -- it's pretty much, if you're not good at a sport, you're not going to get into college and make something of yourself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unless you can -- unless you -- you have the money, and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  The world's all about money -- it's all that matters to people nowadays --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is money.
R:  Yeah, money, money, money -- you know, if you're not driving the right car, you're not -- you don't qualify --
L:  No.
R:  -- and if you're not, you know, if you don't live in a gorgeous house, or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's tough, you know, nothing -- nothing's easy, you have to fight for everything that you got.
L:  Except for [several inaudible words] -- and -- and like, even the people on TV and like, the basketball players and stuff, you know, what do they have to?  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have to get up and train, ring a ding ding.
R:  Mhm, that's real tough, you know, they don't have to go to work or anything.
L:  I --
R:  That is their work.
L:  Yeah.  I have to get up at six o'clock in the morning and chase a one year old around until eight o'clock at night -- I'd like to see them do that.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] -- do you work also, or [inaudible] --
L:  No, I just take care of him.
R:  Uh-huh, that's a job in itself.
L:  Yeah, that's [MN] one of the hardest jobs you could ever have.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] of course -- childcare is the hardest thing ever.
L:  And, I'm not getting paid for it.
R:  No, you're ...
