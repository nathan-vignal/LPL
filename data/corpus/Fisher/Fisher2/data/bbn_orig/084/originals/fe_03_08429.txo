L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  [NOISE]  Hi, I'm Karen.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, Karen, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- ah, I guess, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're talking about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- September Eleventh, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right?
L:  Yes, yes.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Uh-huh.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Now, let's see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] what s- sort of changes --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- have I made, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] or have they been made --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- without my, ah, -- actually --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- participating [LAUGH] in there.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, the subways, ah, take much longer to --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- travel on from Brooklyn ... to Manhattan.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, that's been a change.  I have to re --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] plan time differently.
L:  [NOISE]  Put your time in.  Ah, [NOISE] yes, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that would make a big difference.  [SIGH]  The only --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- difference I can think of that it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had on me is --
R:   [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] f- flights when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm I'm getting ready to l- leave you have to be at the airport, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, two hours early.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  So, you spend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of t- time --
R:  [NOISE]  That's true.
L:  -- t- there.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And -- [SIGH] and then you have to, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, [SIGH] strip down you feel like to nothing.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah, your --
L:  So, they can, --
R:  -- s- shoes.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- know everything that you have ... i- in your suitcase and on your body and anything [NOISE] possible.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that would probably be the biggest change --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- f- for me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And then, [NOISE] also, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to concerts and things.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  I think the security has been --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- twice as much so you have to be very careful.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, that's true but, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, [NOISE] I'm used to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- h- having to go to airports, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] early --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] but not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with -- when [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for flights within the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- United States --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] because, um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I have, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, s- sons in Israel and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] if I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I fly there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's always, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a long c- check.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Ah, right.  [SIGH]  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  And flying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] ah, but I was used to, you know, [NOISE] being able to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fly in the United States without any p- problems.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Without any problems.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now you have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really ... give yourself a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of time but that's s- something you get used to.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, you get used to it, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I guess, [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]  It's --
L:  -- um, how --
R:  -- it makes --
L:  -- it's changed [SIGH] -- the one thing [NOISE] that's changed for me too is the fact that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] I guess I'm -- [NOISE] I do better in a, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ignorance is bliss kind of thing because --
R:  [SIGH]  You do.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH]  I don't watch the news --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as much because [NOISE] [SIGH] it's a constant, [NOISE] --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, --
R:  Yeah, bombardment [NOISE] o- of --
L:  -- yes, [NOISE] --
R:  -- security --
L:  -- of things that --
R:  -- issues.
L:  -- that everything's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- going on and I -- I just [NOISE] -- [SIGH] I feel like if I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- live in my own little world [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe it's better.  [NOISE]  I don't know because --
R:  Do you really?
L:  Well, I'm a [NOISE] worry wart.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I -- I -- I really am.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I worry a lot.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And so if I don't hear [NOISE] all that stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then I don't think about it so much.  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of isolated myself, I guess, [NOISE] [SIGH] would be one way to say [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that it's changed [NOISE] me.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I think, ah, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I think that's too bad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because ignorance is n- not bliss, [SIGH] --
L:  I know.  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a dangerous world.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I mean it's good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to feel --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] well f- faith --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is faith and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- but it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to keep your e- eyes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- open.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  When you -- when you go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- places, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, notice --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] what [SIGH] people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are doing and h- how they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- acting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I happen to have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the night before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] S- September Eleventh, Two Thousand and O- one, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] my son was flying from --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- New York C- City --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] to California --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with his --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] fiance.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, I went to the ... airport --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to see him off --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and I didn't meet him r- right away and I saw a man --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] who I am sure n- now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was casing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the airport --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- s- security.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH]  Yes, the reason I think so -- [LAUGH] well, first of all he was dressed in [SIGH] the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a Mullah's outfit, you know, those long --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dresses --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- and the -- the skull --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- caps --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he had bit beard.  I mean he was clearly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a -- um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a Muslim c- cleric.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  And what interested me --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- was that he had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no ... luggage --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and this was the Qantas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- airport and he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- looking for anybody.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  You can tell --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and he wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- looking at, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, arrival, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, i- information or anything.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  He was just standing there --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- looking around without any luggage.  He wasn't leaving -- I mean, Qantas.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I looked at him --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and he looked back at me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with, ah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] 'cause I was really curious.  [MN]  He looked back at me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with a strange insolent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- look on his face.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- later on I realized --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he was thinking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "You w- wait --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- till tomorrow morning".
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]
R:  "You just wait, --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- we're gonna --"
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  "-- get you".  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my.  [NOISE]  Uh-uh.
R:  A- and I was -- I was very uneasy about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that man, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the way he s- stared at me.
L:  [SIGH]  Huh!  [NOISE]
R:  I mean religious Muslims --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't s- stare at women like that.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  They're not supposed to.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- just looked so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- boldly in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my ... f- face --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it was such a --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] a look --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can hardly describe it.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Huh!  [NOISE]
R:  And that t- to me [COUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] a- a- ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was very uneasy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when my son [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and his fiance, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- left to go on the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --plane, very.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there was a weird, ... ah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- weather night with s- strange lightning --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] you n- never see the sky turn all yellow.
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  You -- there were no --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- jagged [COUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] lightning bolts.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Instead it was just this, oh, God, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- l- lurid yellow and --
L:  [NOISE]  Hm!  [NOISE]
R:  -- the sounds of thunder.  It was very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] h- horrible.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And, ah, I drove --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back to my [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- home and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- c- c- called the airport.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I said, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] "Did they leave?  I feel ... a lot of --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- fear" --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] which I never do.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  And she said, "Oh, no, they're not --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, but of course they had.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  They ignored the weather and they went --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right through it.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my!
R:  But, u- um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] that isn't what I was afraid of.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What I was really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- afraid of --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] was some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the feeling of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ominousness[?] that was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the air.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  And that --
L:  [SIGH]  Hm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- man who ... definitely didn't b- belong --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at an Australian --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- airline's [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- counter.  You know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at a Qantas --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- counter.  [NOISE]
L:  R- right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  O- oh, it -- and he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wasn't with anybody.  I mean he was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I'm quite sure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he was just checking --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- out the security because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- since he was dressed --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] so obviously --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- ah, as --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- a -- a Muslim --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- -- r- religious person --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, y- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- they might have checked him more carefully.  After all --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- the World Trade Center --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- had already been bombed.
L:  R- r- right.  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And, ah, [NOISE] clearly --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- he had gotten --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] through without any problem --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- at all.  He --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- for all I know --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] under that, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, with that dress --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- in a pocket --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- or something, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- he had a --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- box cutter, --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he w- wanted to see --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- if they would stop him.
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  But --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, he was --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- he was not stopped --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- he just went right through.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  A- and, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- so [SIGH] now I feel a little bit better --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- that they're [SIGH] -- except --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- that my f- friend --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] [MN] from college --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- Ruth, she has MS and she wears --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- a brace on her foot, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] a- and at the airport they --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] going from Boston --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- to New York they made her take her brace off.
L:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, you --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- you don't pick --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- on somebody like Ruth, I'm telling you.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  That struck me as r- really weird.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  They let --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- a- all these other --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- really suspicious characters go through.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, when --
R:  That's --
L:  -- we went -- we went -- we just w- went --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to Disney in April, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in Florida and, um, --
R:  You're -- you're a Floridian, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- aren't you?  [SIGH]  Or --
L:  No, I'm from Tennessee.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, you're from Tennessee.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Well, [NOISE] -- uh-hum. --
L:  And we just ... w- went [SIGH] to Walt Disney World --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] and we [NOISE] flew down there and [NOISE] I had worn -- 'cause, y- you know, everybody said [SIGH] they make you take your shoes off.  They make you do --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- all this, so.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I wore sandals [SIGH] thinking, [NOISE] "Well, if I have to do that that'll [NOISE] be the easiest".  And, --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] of course, I got down there and I did [NOISE] -- I had to take my shoes off and --
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] when they scanned [NOISE] my s- shoes through --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] the little scanner [SIGH] it had ... t- there was metal in my sandals.  [SIGH]
R:  My goodness.  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And I didn't know that.  I had no idea.  [SIGH]  And so b- because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of that -- [NOISE] I don't understand why [NOISE] [SIGH] but they made me s- stand there, [SIGH] you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all sprawled out [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]  O- o- oh, --
L:  -- with my bags.
R:  -- n- no.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, on these [NOISE] things and it was, --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- you know, it's kind of humiliating because [SIGH] -- and, of course, I had a three year old --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- and she's standing there going, [SIGH] "Daddy, what's momma doing?  What are they doing to momma?  [NOISE]  What are they doing to momma?" you know.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And he was trying to get her to calm down.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And then she had her little, [SIGH] [NOISE] [MN] um, stuffed animal that she carries around with her everywhere [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and they took that away from her, --
R:  [MN]  Really?  That's just --
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, --
R:  -- 'cause they thought that --
L:  -- and made that go through [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I have to say --
L:  -- the X ray.
R:  -- h- how stupid this is because [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a woman doesn't come with her three year old daughter, if she's got a bomb in her shoes.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's kind of what I would think, too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  And you certainly wouldn't put in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your daughter's toy [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- something that's gonna blow up!
L:  Right.
R:  A- ah, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but they don't have any real logic to this.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's just e- everybody has to --
L:  [NOISE]
