R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, my na- [LAUGH] --
R:  -- my name's Don.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry -- I can't hear you that well.  My name's Lynae[?].
R:  Okay, my name's Don.
L:  Don?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, great, this is my first call [LAUGH] -- how 'bout you?
R:  Oh, it is?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is my third one --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- and my husband did this for me -- he got me set up doing this.
L:  Oh, you're kidding?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, did you hear what the topic was?
L:  Ah, changes that we've made since nine eleven.
R:  Nine eleven.
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  Okay, [MN] --
L:  -- so, like, ah -- [MN] do you have kids?
R:  Yes, I have a lot of 'em [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] well good.
R:  I have four of 'em.
L:  Oh [MN], me too.
R:  And I had my last two since nine eleven.
L:  Oh, okay, me too, I think -- no --
R:  So ...
L:  -- yeah, yeah.
R:  We're talking about when the bombing was, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  When -- the Oklahoma City bombing?  [NOISE] No?
L:  Actually, the New York -- New York --
R:  Oh, when the planes hit the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, okay, now I got it.
L:  Yeah, and -- and, um, I guess -- I guess I haven't made changes [MN], I mean on a global factor -- I still travel, I still do all that kind of thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, I -- I think it's made me more, um, nervous overall about my family, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not that much, but you know, you do -- you keep your kids, ah --
R:  Safer.
L:  -- a little closer [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, a little safer, yeah -- no, I haven't had my kids since then -- I thought they were talking about the other one.
L:  Oh, since Oklahoma.
R:  You know, the one in Oklahoma City --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --  yeah, because see, that's we live -- is in Oklahoma.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you were a lot more probably aware of this, even before then, you were worried about things like that happening.
R:  Right, 'cause I moved away from there, and I moved down here to Eupholla[?] --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and that's like almost two and a half mi- -- hours away --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because of all that stuff, but um ...
L:  So [MN], you live in a small town now?
R:  Yes, a very small town [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, do you feel safer there?
R:  Um, yeah, I do -- I feel like the kids' schools are safer too, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK], as far as what happened in New York, I feel bad for those people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Where the planes hit the buildings and stuff --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- I feel bad for those people.
L:  -- and you think, "But, what can you do?", I mean --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you can't live [MN] -- nothing I'm gonna do is necessarily going to affect anything like that because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you can't be totally safe all the time and take any precautions, you just have to [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, my son's --
L:  -- hope that that doesn't happen, and do your best, but -- but ah ...
R:  Right --
L:  -- and all that, but ...
R:  -- my son went flying, um, just like a month ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to go see my mom in Ohio --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I know they've made the airports really a lot safer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than they used to be, I mean, they were checking in between my toes -- I wanted to make sure he got on the plane okay and everything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I kinda went back there with him, and they had me, ah, fill out a paper saying who I was and stuff, and I had to give it to the security guard, and then they had me walk through the metal detector, like they always did --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then they checked between my toes --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- and they had a metal thing, and they checked -- and I was like, "Wow, what are they doing"?, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but they were really, really alert.  Have you flown since then?
L:  Yeah, I flew a coupla months ago, just to Texas -- I live in Utah, and so I flew to Texas, and they did -- they were real thorough and they ah, made me leave my eyebrow scissors -- I had some little teeny scissors that sometimes I use on my eyebrows and I couldn't take them on the plane --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- they made me leave 'em at the airport, so, I know they're -- which is good --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're very thorough I guess, and -- and you -- [MN] I guess you can't be [MN] extreme --
R:  Right, they --
L:  -- I mean, it -- because like, have you seen on the news where they say, they take that full body -- the picture of you, um -- at the airports they were testing some -- where they take a full body, like an x ray of you --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- so, it was like you were standing there naked --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- and so, what the people going through would see, the testers would see you naked -- it was a naked picture of you --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- even though you had your clothes on, because they could tell obviously what you had anywhere on your body that way, but, you know, most people were going, "Now that's a little bit ...", [LAUGH] --
R:  That's a little bit too much, I think.
L:  I don't want people looking at me naked, even if it's for --
R:  So, they're not doing that are they?
L:  What's that?
R:  They're not doing that now?
L:  Ah, I think -- they have been trying it for the last few months, like, just -- I don't know if they've been doing it in a select test market, or what, but they -- but -- and maybe they've just pulled people, but -- and said, "What you feel like if this happened?", and most people are like, "No way, that's, you know, too much".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I guess [MN] -- they have to draw the line somewhere and -- and I don't know -- I don't know, it's crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I just try to teach my kids and explain to them what happened to those people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, um, my daughter, she's eight, and then I have a three year old -- course she don't understand, and then I've got one that's sixteen, and one that's nineteen --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and, no, I got 'em spread apart [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  But, and then I babysit another eight year old and a -- and a one year old --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so ah, I try to explain to the eight year olds the most, because, um, you know, they see all this stuff on TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, and at first they were kinda worried about it and stuff, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I just explained to 'em that it'll be okay, and, you know, that there were some bad people that did this, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, not to be afraid to go to school, and stuff like that, and --
L:  Yeah, well, and, you know, it's [MN], like you say, it's -- it's terrible for the people that happened to, but there's things that are more likely to affect us --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, like, you know, [MN] I live in Salt Lake and -- and we, you know, they had the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping, and, you know, all the other kidnappings that've been taking place in the last couple of years, and you think -- you have a lot more chance of having your child kidnapped --
R:  Than that happening again.
L:  -- than you probably do -- yeah, than you do have of being bombed by a terrorist, right?
R:  Right, right. 
L:  You know, and so, the changes that are the things that I do, probably have to do with more like, things that I think there's a chance that will happen to my children, you know, or my family, not, and -- and terrorism, you know, is a small chance, I mean, I'm glad the government's doing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something about it, 'cause I probably can't do anything about it.
R:  Well, we can't do anything, I mean --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- all we have to do -- we have to live and be cautious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but what are we supposed to do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like that -- what was that anthrax, on the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what paper was it? Um, [NOISE], National Enquirer --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we went to put an ad in there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that week is when that came out.
L:  Oh, no way.
R:  And they didn't see the ad -- we paid all this money to put a ad in there, um, I forgot what it was we were selling, but we were gonna sell something and we went to go put a ad in there, and that anthrax showed up --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on that paper, and I'm like, "What are the odds of that happening?" --
L:  The one time you do that [LAUGH].
R:  -- we never had put a ad in there before, you know?  Yeah, and they quit buying it -- you could see 'em on the shelves --
L:  Oh, shoot.
R:  -- and nobody was buying 'em --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- and you're going --
L:  Wait a minute [LAUGH].
R:  -- "Oh, no [LAUGH] well, we picked the wrong time", and we paid all that money to have it on there and then it never did get probably seen by very many people.
L:  Yeah, wow, ah --
R:  You know?
L:  -- and what can you do?  That's just -- ah, really bad luck [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Yeah, it's like, "Wow, how can we ...?", you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we just picked the wrong week I guess, so ...
L:  Yeah, and it makes you mad, because those people do interrupt your lives, like you say, and they do -- they can mess up people's lives, even if it's because the schools close down, or the -- you know, the places close down, or -- or, you know, like you say, people don't buy things [MN] -- it does affect you I guess --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in the long run, it does affect you, and it's affected our economy, you know --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- nine eleven affected our economy, so I guess that affects us, and it's -- it's so maddening 'cause it's -- it's just [MN] --
R:  I know, and these people --
L:  -- it's the people that --
R:  -- they're not flying anymore --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, so the airport people, they don't have a job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so like -- you know, a lot of 'em have lost their job because of all this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's not stopping my mom --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my mom had double -- well, she had a transplant on her lungs --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on both her lungs, and now that she's had that transplant -- she had it like, I think about three years ago, Jim?  She just said that, I think her third birth- -- the third year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in November or something, and she still flies everywhere --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it's not gonna stop her -- she says she's alive now, you know, and she can breathe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and she couldn't breathe for five or six years there --
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  -- because of the disease -- yeah, and now --
L:  She has her life back, huh?
R:  -- she's gonna go everywhere.
L:  She probably thinks this is great [LAUGH].
R:  Oh yeah, she's not gonna stop living because of what these people did, you know?
L:  I know, mhm.
R:  She flew my son to see her, just, like I said, about a month ago --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then Friday, tomorrow, she's gonna get on the -- they're flying into -- she's gonna get on a plane and go to Arizona --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- and see my brother in Arizona --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's not gonna stop her at all, you know.
L:  Well, that's probably good, and like you say, the chances are so small of, you know, that flight from wherever to Arizona being, you know, that it [inaudible] --
R:  Right, from Ohio -- 
L:  -- oh, okay.
R:  -- she's going from Ohio to Arizona, and --
L:  Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, we're going to Disneyland next week, so are they -- if they bomb Disneyland --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  -- I guess we're there [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, it's a lotta fun -- I haven't been since I was eight years old --
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  -- so that's been -- almost thirty years ago, but --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- um, it -- it was really neat.
L:  -- we have a good excuse, 'cause we -- my husband has two brothers down there, so -- it's our excuse to go down there to see them.
R:  Really?  I had two uncles down there -- one of them just passed away a few years ago, but I had one in Miami --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then one right down there by, ah, what is it?  New Orleans?  Is that right?
L:  New Orleans?
R:  Yeah, they were both at one end of the -- of Florida.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so, we got to travel through Florida, a lot --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- when we got there, we -- we rented a car, and we went to see the other family [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, we had a great time.
L:  Yeah, that's neat, well --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- I'm glad you're, you know -- hopefully we'll [MN] keep travelling, keep the economy going, and -- and the other thing I guess is that, ah, you -- you know, you teach your kids, I mean, sure it was the um [LIPSMACK] -- um, Arabs, or whoever that um, bombed the World Trade Center, or, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- crashed into it, but [MN], you know, you have to be cautious, but you can't say, you know, teach your kids to treat, um, people like that any differently --
R:  Bad, I know, one of my, um --
L:  -- you know, and that's hard.
R:  -- one of my daughter's, ah, friend is dating one of 'em --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, a young teenager? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think she's like, sixteen or seventeen, and she's dating a guy that's from  there, and ah, they came to the house the other ...
