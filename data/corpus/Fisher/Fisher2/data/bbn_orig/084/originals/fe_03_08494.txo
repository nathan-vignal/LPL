R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Kenny.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing all right.  This is Marlow.
R:  Hello Marlow.  So, what do you think about the -- the athletes?  With their pri- -- or getting paid so much.
L:  Um, are they on strike or something?
R:  No.  They -- they -- they want you to talk about you think it's um, too much money they get, like, you know, some of them get like, thirty million dollars for like, five years.  Some of them get two hundred and fifty million for, like, eight years.
L:  Okay, well if they're doing it right for a -- a good cause, like to help the crippled children and stuff like that, I'm all for it.
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  And that's what I think a lot of the athletes, you know, are -- they are doing, ah, for them.  And that's what I -- well, that's what I thought it was for, anyway.
R:  Most athletes, they just, you know, they buy them million dollar cars, million dollar houses and --
L:  Exactly.  That -- yeah, they getting too pa- -- paid too much for someone who [several inaudible words]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the organizations for like, you know, helping the poor crippled children and stuff like that, yeah.  I think that, you know, and like the Vietnam veterans and all that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that need wheelchairs and all of that --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of those vets don't even get that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they served in the war and lose body parts and everything, and I can't believe the way they're treated.
R:  No.
L:  So yeah, the, ah -- the athletes get paid a lot more money than ah, people like us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't think that's fair.
R:  I -- I'll never see two hundred and fifty million in my life unless I hit the lottery.
L:  Neither would I. [LAUGH] Never in a million years.
R:  [LAUGH] I won't --
L:  And I'm sure too old to go be an athlete now for sure.
R:  I almost became an athlete but I broke both my ankles, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I could have had a chance to play basketball te- -- about twenty years ago.
L:  Oh goodness.
R:  I could have had a chance to be in the NBA.
L:  Well my son wanted to be a basketball player at one time in his life, but he was so discouraged in school because, you know how it is, most of the people want to take over and think, well they're the ones ahead of you and push you aside, so I said, "Oh no.  Uh-huh."
R:  See I was -- I was tall in high school.  I was the tallest one they ever seen in high school back in the eighties.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, for six nine?  Oh yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  So --
L:  And you broke two ankles?
R:  Yeah.  My senior year, my last game they had scouts there, and -- and we were playing against this team that was really rough, and it was out at Cleveland, Ohio, and two of 'em, came up and they just pushed me the wrong way and when I landed I landed the wrong way and broke both of my ankles and they had to put pins in both my ankles.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  And then, all of a sudden you're just [inaudible] benches just plod out onto the four day[?] and like, what they -- they did me.  There went -- there went my chances of going to college.  I lost my chance.
L:  See what I mean?  That's sad.
R:  I had a chance.  'Cause I -- I told -- I told everybody, "I'm going -- I'm going to college.  I'm going to NBA and I want to play for the Lakers."
L:  Mhm.
R:  I suppose my dream growing up was to play for the Lakers.
L:  Well I think I -- isn't Scotty Pippin on the Lakers now?  The one that was on Chicago Bulls?
R:  Uh-huh.  No.
L:  Who was he -- what team is he on?
R:  Ah, I don't know.  Ah, Portland --
L:  I know there's somebody from the Chicago, ah, Bulls that's on the Lakers now.  I don't know if it's ah, him or that other guy.
R:  Do you mean Phil Jackson, the coach?
L:  Yeah.  Him too.
R:  But there's nobody else.
L:  I thought one of those went to there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Unless it's only the other team I'm thinking about.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause to me he was a wonderful coach.  And I never liked basketball in my life until my son got me to watch the Chicago Bulls.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh yes, and I -- I was so thrilled over it, let me tell you.  I'm -- I'm -- sad that they went all different kind of ways, 'cause then I got hooked on it. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I said, "Oh, yes", you know, they really bust their butt [several inaudible words]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's give or take situation now.  And for example, like that cause right there, I feel they should get paid --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- very well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, they do help people --
R:  Some of them -- some of them don't --
L:  -- not all of them, no, right, some of them do.
R:  -- because you know, it's like that -- like two years ago they had steroid use came out of that.  Steroid thing came out, and if you -- if you watch the news most of these players, like basketball, football and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're getting nailed for drugs and cocaine and stuff.
L:  Yes, they are.  I'm amazed about that too and that's what I was saying, these people making that much money?
R:  And I say, just give me some of that money.  Let me have some of that -- what they need to do is -- wherever they're -- they're from, they need to take part of that -- their money out of their taxes and put it into the state.
L:  Right.
R:  To help the -- the schools, to help out with the roads, to help out with peoples on prog- -- on low income, everything.
L:  Yeah, because they take our tax dollars.  People like us that work.  It makes me mad because they give it to these people, they get checks every month and they're more capable of working than me or you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they use their money for drugs and drinking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I mean, that's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if people like us are made to work, well there -- there's stuff that they can do as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they can go clean houses or baby-sit or whatever their mind level is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they get checks instead.  But I didn't know that athletes was getting paid that much money.
R:  Oh yeah.  Like um, I'll give you an example:  Have you ever heard of Arod Rodriguez --
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's a baseball player --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he makes two hundred and fifty million dollars for eight years.
L:  Good god!
R:  That's a lot of money.  I think he has more money than the President Bush gets, I think.
L:  Cor.
R:  I think.  That's -- that's a lot of money.  A hundred --
L:  That's just for a what?  An eight year contract?
R:  Yeah, a hundred thousand just to sign on con- -- sign on bonus.  That was three years ago.  I was like, "Oh my god!"  And he's turned around and he's got three Lamborghini's, and I was like, "Oh, give me one them cars!"
L:  Mhm.  Well, don't get me wrong, there's some of them that really work hard for it.  Like to me, like the Chicago Bulls, I find they really work hard for their money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there's some, that, you know, but there's some too that say they would help the organizations and all, and like I said, I don't know if they do or not, if it's true or not.
R:  Yeah, it's like the -- the um, there's this one guy, I don't know where he's from.  I think he's with the Seventy Sixer's or Philadelphia.  He takes half his check and he gives it to the homeless, out of the state of Pennsylvania.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For the um -- so if he makes a hundred thousand, he gets fifty thousand for a year.  He takes the other fifty thousand, gives it to the homeless.
L:  Well he should be recommended very highly for his honor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause not too many people would do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I said, I've seen Vietnam veterans that have lost body parts, and my own brother served in that war.  They do not care about them people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's sad.
R:  That's true.
L:  But I -- I didn't know -- the athletes are on strike right now or something?
R:  No.
L:  Or do they go on strike, or whatever?
R:  They -- they go on strike if they don't get what they want.  If they want more money then they go on strike.
L:  Oh.  I always wondered where did all this money come from?
R:  I don't know.
L:  That they get paid for.
R:  Either the owners pay for it or the people that go to the games pay for it.
L:  Oh okay.  But that's still a lot of money.
R:  But I don't now how -- how somebody can come up with two hundred and fifty million and then say like, um, like a team gets ah, say ah, seven hundred million -- seven hundred million dollars just for one team.
L:  Right.
R:  Where does it come from?
L:  That's what I've always wondered.  Where did it come from?
R:  Almost --
L:  I know they have sponsors and stuff, I guess, but that's still a lot of millions of dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I know they play games all over the world and all and people go play, but [LAUGH] that still don't add up to that much money there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Plus the coaches and all them's got to get paid their money as well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I always wondered about that myself, you know, and I said, "Well, I don't know."
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  But this world is getting outrageous.  I remember when I was growing up, it used to be, you know, like Hank Aaron, he'd -- the most he ever made was forty seven thousand dollars a year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that was back in the seventies, and all of a sudden, eighties, a hundred thousand and then all of a sudden, wham, two hundred and fifty thousand, I was like, oh my god.  I thought Shaquille O'Neal was a lot of money for a hundred and twenty five thousand till I seen Arod's. I was like, "Whoa."
L:  I know.  And what's that other one that played on the Chicago Bulls?  Ah, Redman.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or Rodman.
R:  Rodman.  Dennis.
L:  Yeah, he gets a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.  Just to be weird. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Now you understand that?  If I go up there and ah, dress like that or be weird, I'd probably get locked up.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's what amazes me, but that man gets a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't feel he should get a lot of money for ah, what he represents, 'cause he's not really out there to bust his butt to play ball like the rest of 'em.
R:  Oh, he busted his butt.  'Cause he -- he bounced -- bounced around.  He may not score points but he would pull down twenty, twenty five rebounds a game.
L:  I know, but still and all, you know, and I mean, it's like, to me it's like he's just tip toeing through the tulips when them.
R:  Er --
L:  Acting silly and all.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  They're more or less what his fame about what kind of person he is
