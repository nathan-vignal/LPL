R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  This is --
R:  My name is Owen.
L:  Justine.  M- --
R:  Hi Justine.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  I'm good.
L:  Good. [LAUGH] Um, so, I guess the topic is, ah, what changes have you met in your -- made in your life after nine eleven?
R:  Right.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK] -- um, it's hard to say now.  I mean, 'cause I think maybe, like, right after nine eleven I was a little bit more aware of my surroundings and all that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but then, like, gradually I guess, you know, I went back to, sort of, just day to day life.
R:  Right.
L:  Y- you know, a- as -- as the -- not -- not as if, you know, the incident hadn't occurred but --
R:  Right.
L:  I haven't really made any in- -- changes that are permanent I guess.
R:  Right.
L:  Have you?
R:  Well, um, I would say that it only strengthened my feelings that there's a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more going on in our own government than --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than, you know, people realize.  Because all the -- the -- the events that happened on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- September eleventh, to me, there were so many things that are -- that are, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- unexplained and suspicious --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and weird and just don't make sense to me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that -- that it just confirmed a lot of my suspicions that there's just a lot of -- I mean, you know, this is a great place to live.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- and I love, you know, being an American but I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that there's just, you know -- there's a lotta shady stuff going on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that, ah, you know, um --
L:  Do you live in DC also or --
R:  No.  I live in New --
L:  I don't know.
R:  I live in New York.  I was in New York City when it happened.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  I'm actually in DC so, I guess, um, you know, maybe two -- two of the places it affected most I guess.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But, um -- yeah.  I mean, I personally haven't really made changes but I mean, just in terms of, like, the threat cha- -- threat level changes and, you know, the --
R:  Right.  I mean, i- it, you know --
L:  That's --
R:  I just started to -- to, like -- I mean, the changes -- you know what actually changed?  I found God more.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I was, ah -- I'm Jewish but I -- I actually got saved.  I'm a born again believer.
L:  Mm-kay.
R:  And -- and it -- it -- it was not so much because of September eleventh itself but that, you know, I just started, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I had all this stuff happen to me after September eleventh that I reali- -- I -- I felt that God was, like, really communicating with me and, like, showing me the way.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and I -- I really do think that September eleventh was, like, a biblical event.  I mean, that was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- apocalyptic, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, it -- it definitely -- n- nothing in -- in my lifetime never happened like that and --
R:  No.
L:  -- I don't think it will again, hopefully. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Well, you never know. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Well, I guess, I mean just more on a personal level, I think I -- I -- I, sort of, a- -- became more of -- aware of other cultures.  Um --
R:  Okay.  Sure.
L:  And learning about, um, you know, Muslims, ah, cultures and, sort of, just reading more articles about how America's perceived by other countries.  Um --
R:  Right.
L:  And I guess, I mean, you know, at first I didn't think of that 'cause I didn't really realize, um, [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] that it occurred but I -- I definitely think it was because of that event that, you know, I -- I, sort of, read more about, you know, different -- different areas of the world and all that.  I mean --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  And just, sort of -- I don't know.  Not to say that I can try any, sort of, comprehensive understanding --
R:  Right.
L:  But just to, sort of, get an idea of, you know, why some things -- so, you know, that things so out of the blue could happen.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, and then --
R:  Um, yeah.  I mean, I -- I would say that I'm paying more attention to, like, international news now.  Like --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, like I started watching on, um -- on, ah, twenty one here -- WLIW, they had -- they have BBC news.
L:  Right.
R:  And they also, you know, go on -- on the web.  I got to BBC, um -- the B -- the BBC's website.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  I mean, a- --
R:  Because --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- a lot of the news -- a lot of the news in the United States is very local.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, whereas, you know -- to me, it's like, you know, the -- the fire down the street isn't as im- -- a big of a deal anymore, you know?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  It's like --
L:  Um --
R:  -- there're much bigger things going on.
L:  [NOISE] I think, ah, that's definitely true for me too.  Like, I definitely started looking for other news sources besides the ones I'm, you know, traditionally used to.  But also, I would say, like, w- -- you know, when something does happen -- I mean, this was more, um, closer t- -- ah, you know, to nine eleven but, um, if something happens, like, you know, that plane crash in Queens or whatever, it's just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, the media is, sort of, you know -- that -- that's, sort of, one of the first [LAUGH] things you, kind of, think of and just --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, you know, I -- I guess you do have, sort of, a worst case scenario now.  You know, like, when before, I would've never even thought that something was, you know, terrorist related --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- or --
R:  Right.  Yeah.  You heard about that bombing in, ah -- at Yale University, like, a couple of months ago, right?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  That, you know, it was just, like -- and actually, I never even heard what was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the final outcome on that.  It seemed to just disappear.
L:  Yeah.  Oh --
R:  And, um --
L:  I'm sorry.  Where'd you say?  In --
R:  It was at Yale.
L:  Oh, at Yale.  Right.  Um, I'm not too sure either.  I remember hearing, um, [NOISE] you know, they thought it might be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- terrorist related but I don't -- I don't remember hearing any reports afterwards either.  I mean, and who knows?  It could've been --
R:  Right.
L:  -- far from that but it's definitely, like, the first thing you think of.
R:  'Cause I mean, you know, I don't know if this is anything to do with it but that was Bush's s- s- school.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So ...
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  I didn't -- I mean, I didn't really think of it in that sense.  I just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, like, associated just a bombing in general.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, with something that might be, like, a target for terrorist attacks.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I, you know -- I can't say ... you know, maybe I've -- [NOISE] I -- e- -- I think it's really hard to, sort of, pinpoint.  There're just really subtle things that you don't really do, um, conscien- conscient- conscientiously.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, I think I might have become closer with my family and -- and just, sort of, you know, relations s- -- I guess, mean a lot more.  Um, and just 'cause we realize, ah, you know, just -- you know, i- it just brings a general sense of awareness to you.
R:  Right.
L:  When something like that happens.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean --
L:  So --
R:  It -- it makes you realize the things, you know -- that we're not immune.  You know, and that, ah -- you know, it -- it -- 'cause we always feel, kind of like, you know, um -- I mean, to some degree, Americans --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- feel that this is the only place there is.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  They -- they, kind of, forget about the rest of the world and -- and this, kind of, made us realize that the rest of the world can affect the United States.  Ah --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  That's definitely true.  I'm not -- I think it's something we probably -- you know, we -- we took for granted or, um --
R:  Our safety, our security.
L:  Our safety and, I mean, I would still say we're pretty safe but, I mean [NOISE] --
R:  Well, see, that's the dangerous --
L:  This --
R:  -- thing is that because nothing has happened since --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- you know, people are starting to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- comfortable again --
L:  Comfortable.
R:  -- and they're starting to, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not worry about it and not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think about it as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  I- --
R:  Ah, I mean, ah, you know, who knows what's gonna happen but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, our security is -- is better than it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's certainly possible that something could happen again.  I mean, it is a huge country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It's very hard to secure the -- the entire country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I definitely agree but I -- I don't think you can really, you know, change your lifestyle --
R:  No.
L:  -- so much that --
R:  No.  You can't -- you can't.  No.
L:  -- you know, you're protected and unless --
R:  There's no way that --
L:  -- you lived in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a box and -- you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  There's no way to -- I mean, if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's -- that's basically it.  But n- -- you know, we -- we s- -- we started to get a feeling of, like -- I mean, could you imagine living in Israel?
L:  Yeah.  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, with -- with the constant threat --
L:  Not really. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, the constant threat of -- of, you know, terrorism?
L:  Right.
R:  And now, I mean, you know, in Iraq, you know, the -- the soldiers -- you know, they're trying to play it down but the soldiers are dying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every day.
L:  Yeah.  No.  They -- I mean, I think they report it on the news quite a bit.  Um --
R:  Well, I just read a thing, which says  --
L:  Maybe they -- they downplay the, um -- you know, how it happened and, um, all that stuff.  But, I mean, what -- I -- I -- the total must be, like, definitely over ten post war, you know?
R:  Oh, it's -- it's at sixty something.
L:  It's more -- it's -- it's what?
R:  Sixty something.
L:  Sixty?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whoa.  That's crazy.
R:  Yep.
L:  I guess that's right because -- I mean, and then the British also had, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the same, sort of --
R:  Well, they -- they just recently took a hit but, ah, j- June was the worst month since -- it's --
L:  Wow.
R:  It's getting worse.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, and then I -- I just read in the paper today that there was a guy who, um -- you know, militant --
