R:  Hello, my name is Louise Dyne.
L:  Hi Louise, this is Cynthia Green, I'm in New York.  Where are you?
R:  [MN] I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, you're not far.
R:  Well ... [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Two hours away.
R:  Well, over the bridge [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Over the bridge.
L:  A couple of 'em, oh, all right, now, what were we saying is going on?  Oh, what changes I've made ...
R:  Since September eleven.
L:  I think that [inaudible] -- yeah --
R:  Well [MN] --
L:  -- well, you know, being here, and seeing it live and in color was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- devastating.
R:  Oh, I'm sure it was, I'm sure it was.
L:  I was in shock for a good part of the day, because I couldn't believe that it was really happening.
R:  I know, it was hero- -- it was terrible.
L:  Yes.
R:  I was watching it on TV and I [MN] -- the -- the -- the scenes over and over again with the buildings --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and every [inaudible] thing, and it was just -- it was hard, it's hard --
L:  And then my sister worked across the street, and I couldn't find her for a while.
R:  Oh.
L:  I really was upset.
R:  That was the most horriblest thing.
L:  And she was home in the bed -- I could kill her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] She said she was so nervous she forgot to call me -- I said, "You were very nervous", [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my god, I guess so, I guess so -- you --
L:  Yeah, she said all she could think about --
R:  It's shock.
L:  -- was calling her husband, yeah, she was scared, 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she said she thought she was looking at a plane crashing when she looked out the window, she saw the second, um --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- building fall down -- and that's what scared her.
R:  I'm sure it did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm sure it did.  That's --
L:  So, I think, and then, she -- they -- she had to go into to um, they had therapy sessions for them, 'cause she was really upset --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- so, we became, [SIGH] a lot more tolerant --
R:  Right.
L:  -- patient --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and tried to be understanding --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of different people, and --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- their motives, and --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- 'cause  you don't know what drives people.
R:  That's what you have to do.
L:  You just don't -- you need to understand.
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  I think -- I think that -- for me, that was it -- I need to understand where all this hatred came from.
R:  Right.  And, I hate to tell you, something like that, I don't know -- you worry that it can happen again, you know what I mean?  That's the only thing bad [inaudible].
L:  Well, that's the downside of it, you're right.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  For a long time I wouldn't ride the subway, because I figured --
R:  They said it --
L:  -- [COUGH] that would be the next spot.
R:  When they said, "War on America", that's exactly what it was.
L:  Yeah, and I'm not [inaudible] -- 
R:  You never -- you never think something like that could happen, that's what [MN] --
L:  I never thought --
R:  -- but [MN] now -- now --
L:  -- you know, let me tell you -- can I tell you something?
R:  Go ahead.
L:  I think I was more upset with America --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than Bin Laden --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- only because, I thought that I was a lot more secure than that.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I couldn't believe that something like that --
R:  Something like that could happen.
L:  -- really happened, right here --
R:  [MN] That --
L:  -- and in New York City of all --
R:  I -- 
L:  -- the places --
R:  -- I know.
L:  Oh no, I -- I tell you I was so pissed I didn't know what to do for a long time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't even know if I'm glad [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
R:  They said it was planned though -- they said it was planned for -- for a while, which I think it was.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Mhm, it was planned.
L:  But, why didn't America know?
R:  [MN] That's right.
L:  How you -- how -- you -- see, they can't tell me that lie -- how could you be a super power and you let something that -- like that happen to you?
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, I was born and raised in Brooklyn --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the street gangs is very prominent --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the one thing you learn is, you gotta protect what's yours.  How?  And if you don't, then you lose it.
R:  That's right.
L:  Now, how could you tell me that you let this happen, and you're a super power?   You ain't a super power no more.
R:  I know.  That's right, that's right.
L:  How could you let that happen [MN]?
R:  I know, how could ya let that happen?
L:  And I was sitting here thinking I was so safe and secure -- that shattered me -- I think more than anything --
R:  I know, mhm, mhm --
L:  -- it hurt my feelings that something like that could happen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I live in Manhattan --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a [MN] -- well, not a few blocks, but I live uptown, that's downtown --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know how close that is?
R:  But in America -- how could that happen?  Like, I mean, this -- how could it happen?  I just don't know how it could happen.
L:  Well, that's why I felt I had to understand where all this hatred came from.
R:  Right.  That's right.
L:  Because -- then I thought as surely Oprah did, what nobody around the world -- see Oprah and CNN and nobody liked America, I said, "Oh, my goodness".
R:  Mhm.
L:  We were in trouble -- shit [LAUGH].
R:  I know, I know.
L:  This is trouble.
R:  Yes [MN], and I -- and I guess, you know what?  You -- you know -- it -- it -- it's -- it's a couple of years later, but you know what?  It's something nobody will ever forget -- nobody will ever forget.
L:  That's what I'm gonna say -- it's not a later, you know --
R:  You know, you'll remember September eleventh --
L:  Yes --
R:  -- that's -- that one day --
L:  -- nine, one, one.
R:  -- I mean, you'll never forget that -- one day you'll never forget -- never.
L:  No, not me.
R:  All the people and everything you saw, it was terrible.  I'm sorry I haven't got to New York to see what -- what, you know, see that place, but --
L:  Oh, that --
R:  -- I -- but I --
L:  -- that's another hurting feeling.
R:  -- [inaudible] ground zero, whatever they call it --
L:  Yes, ground zero.
R:  -- well, but -- but you know what?  You know what?  It was enough to watch it and it -- they -- and -- and they --
L:  Well, let me tell you something --
R:  -- I've seen the people they took out of there and oh, people that they --
L:  You know when I went down there --
R:  -- they never found -- they never found so many people, let's face it.
L:  Yeah, that's terrible.  But, you know, when I went down there?  About three months ago -- that was the first time --
R:  Really?
L:  -- ah, that's right -- I'm telling you, I was pissed -- you think I mean kidding?
R:  No.
L:  They scared me to death, to think that someone could just --
R:  Scared you to death.
L:  -- fly over here and do something like that.
R:  I know, mhm, mhm.
L:  I don't think I could ever get over that -- I -- I think --
R:  I know, I know.
L:  -- I mean, not that I thought we were invincible --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but a little more than that, I thought it would take.
R:  I know, mhm.
L:  You know, that was two years --
R:  Other countries [inaudible] okay because there is so much, ah, [MN] they accept wars and everything all -- all over the -- you know, the other parts of [MN] -- but the size of the United States -- there's always wars somewhere, somewhere, whatever --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- but here you think, you know, it [MN] why -- why here?
L:  It was a hard feeling, I want you to know -- [SIGH] and that's why I feel that I have to be more understanding --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and more tolerant of other people.
R:  Right, yes, you do.
L:  Unless your name is Cynthia Green, you not gonna be like me, you not gonna think like me.
R:  Right, and you have to take every day -- [MN] every day and thank God -- you open your eyes and say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "I'm here [MN]" --
L:  Yeah, one day at a time.
R:  -- right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Open your eyes [MN] and God -- thank God I'm here -- my family's --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- here, and you know, and just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- be a little bit -- bit more nicer to people if you can, you know what I mean?
L:  That's right, yeah I do.
R:  Be more kinder to people, you know?
L:  But [MN], and I'm -- I'm gonna tell you something --
R:  Please do.
L:  -- I really think most New Yorkers have been [MN] -- to me --
R:  Really?
L:  -- I -- yeah, I find a great change in this city -- people chat a little more with each other, you know, a lot more friendly --
R:  Right -- it --
L:  -- it's very surprising --
R:  -- yes, yes --
L:  -- and I think that's what it's from -- it's got to be --
R:  That's right, that's right.
L:  Because, it devastated us --
R:  Devastated, yes.
L:  -- it did --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- this whole city was -- oh -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- it was so quiet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you could hear a pin drop.
R:  People were afraid, weren't they?
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN] They said there was -- you know, New York was so afraid they -- they didn't see people every -- you know how +people --
L:  I'm telling you --
R:  -- people are -- there are just mobs of people all the time, but ah [several inaudible words] 
L:  No.
R:  -- for some reason nobody was out on the streets --
L:  Nobody --
R:  -- it was like a -- was like a --
L:  -- I'm telling you, you could hear a pin drop --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- in this city.
R:  It's -- it's unbelievable.
L:  I'm telling you -- I said, "What in the world ...", I said to myself, so "Why is it so quiet?"
R:  People were scared to walk the streets --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- people were scared [MN] -- it wasn't over, that's what it was --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- people were scared it wasn't over --
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  -- [MN] maybe tomorrow or the next day -- they -- they don't know what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- building was gonna come down -- what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they were scared -- people were scared.
L:  [LIPSMACK] My daughter was down on ah, Fifth Avenue and Thirty First Street, and so she -- somebody must have told them that they were going to blow up the Wor- -- the um, Empire State Building --
R:  Really?
L:  -- that poor child was hysterical --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- she said she took off her shoes [several inaudible words] Russell sneakers 'cause the shoes were [several inaudible words] her away -- I [several inaudible words] -- called up and said, "Mommy, I don't know what's happening [MN] -- and I don't know if I'm gonna get to you, but I'm on my way uptown", [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
R:  That's right, right.
L:  -- buses scared her -- 
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- she said the buses were crowded --
R:  [MN] Oh --
L:  -- she couldn't get on the bus --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- she had to walk -- she walked all the way up here.
R:  -- wanted to come and hug you and thank god, you're there -- she's here.
L:  And I said to her, "You -- you -- sh- ...", and then I'm scared 'cause I don't know where she is --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- oh, I was a pit -- I was a mess that day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Until everybody checked in.  Then my -- my youngest called and said, "What is going on?  I went to sleep, I had twin towers.  I woke up, there are no twin towers" --
R:  Get out.
L:  Yeah, he was a little upset --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  So I said, "Well, you [several inaudible words] to explain this to him".
R:  Right -- how old is he?  [MN].
L:  He's twenty six --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- but you know, I gotta [LAUGH] -- that's my youngest son --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- but he never saw -- nothing ever happened, you know --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- he like -- this the first time anything ever [MN] -- that's the first time anything ever happened like that shit in my life, so I can imagine at twenty six he was devas- -- he looked at me, he said, "Is this real?  Because ..." -- at that time we was early in the morning. it was on TV -- nobody was sure exactly what was going on, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I said, "Well, unless they're making a movie ...", 'cause at first I thought I -- everybody's going to work -- that's a good time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to be making a movie.  They're not knocking down the twin towers --
R:  Oh, my god.  
L:  -- [LAUGH] this has gotta be some movie.
R:  [MN] 
L:  I said, "I [several inaudible words] the movies".
R:  But like I said, they knew what was going on, and -- and they -- [MN] [several inaudible words] people are dying -- it -- you know, when they did that, they -- they -- they were dead themself -- they were dead themself when they put the --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- planes in there.
L:  Yes.
R:  And all, you know?
L:  And isn't that scary -- you don't care if you kill, see -- I told my sister, "This is where me and Bin Laden would of had a parting of the ways", when he tells Cynthia -- telling me to do something crazy is one thing, but now you want me to stay in this airplane and blow up with it? --
R:  I kn- --
L:  "-- Oh no Bin, I don't think so".
R:  -- I know.
L:  This [NOISE] [inaudible].
R:  They -- they -- they all -- they -- they know that's what they have to do -- that -- they know that --
L:  Yeah, [MN] --
R:  -- they know that -- they probably give 'em a couple of million dollars to their families and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you know what I mean?  So ...
L:  Yeah, he can afford a coupla million dollars -- he get about four hundred million [LAUGH].
R:  Well, that's what I'm saying, yeah -- you know, so many people there, they're -- you know, so -- [MN] you know, it's a terrible ...
L:  It's ridiculous.
R:  I know, [MN] --
L:  I don't think I could be that dedicated and believe in something like, [MN] to that extent -- I [MN] -- I -- I know I couldn't, no I couldn't.
R:  But, you still, you know, the thing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it is, you -- you know, you forget -- you forget, but every once and while you just -- you can't forget.
L:  I don't think -- that's one thing I don't think people should forget.
R:  No, [MN].
L:  You need to remember that.
R:  That's right, you do [MN].
L:  Because, that is living proof of how much hatred there is in this world.
R:  And I mean, and like the -- the -- the TV was every day for hour -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, the whole thing was for days and days and days [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's all you do --
L:  Yeah.
