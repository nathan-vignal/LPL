R:  Hello?
L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm CJ.
R:  Hi, my name is Heather.
L:  Oh, hi Heather.
R:  Hi, I'm --
L:  Where are you located?
R:  I'm from New York.
L:  Oh, I'm in California.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Well you -- well, you oughta -- oughta have a lot of changes since then.
R:  [MN] Yeah, yeah, kinda, like -- I -- I don't know, I'm like more afraid to go to the city and stuff.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, so you're outside of the city?
R:  Yeah, I live in Long Island.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, but not too far.
R:  Yeah, not too far, but, um, I mean, I still go to the city and everything, but I'm just like, more careful when I go.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, [MN] careful how?
R:  I don't know, like, I just try to be more aware of like, who's around me and stuff.
L:  Oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, that makes sense -- [MN] --
R:  Like I won't go -- 'cause my friends like to go to like, clubs in the city --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I try to like, I go -- I'll go, but I don't go as often, I guess.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I can understand that I -- I think it affected California, but not in the same way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, us being so far away but, um, it made -- when they started having the [MN] -- oh, what do they call 'em?  Not the -- the -- the national guard people --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that were like on San Francisco, Golden Gate Bridge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, in -- inside all the little airports and everything [MN] --
R:  Yeah, I mean, I heard -- wasn't there like, something, some threat towards California?
L:  Yeah, they -- they said something about water supplies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, people were going to put something in the water supplies because a lot of the water for, um, Los Angeles comes out of reservoirs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they figured if they could poison the reservoirs then, it would, you know, it -- once it's in the whole water system, what are you gonna do?
R:  Yeah, you can't do anything.
L:  Yeah, so they put, [MN] you know, guards around things like that, but, for me personally, I mean, I've always been, kind of, you know, try to be aware of my surroundings --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, it -- it just -- it ended up making me really, really sad that something like that would happen --
R:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- and, I called all my friends on the East Coast and -- and checked that out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, it's been -- because it's been two ye- -- almost two years, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of people [MN] out in California, have kind of [MN] it appears to me, not, you know, they're [MN] -- I don't know, it's kinda like they're -- they're aware of it, but it's more on the back burner -- they don't have the constant reminder of like the people that are in New York --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- that still go by and -- and see where the twin towers were and things like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  Have you been to New York?
L:  Um, I've been through New York --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- for, had a -- had a New York pizza there --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- didn't -- then I saw someone getting a meatball sandwich and I was real disappointed I didn't get one of those --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, I've been to it, but -- I -- I'm not too much on big cities anyway --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, that's probably why [MN] I kinda like being in a small town, I think I feel more protected being in a smaller town --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- than if I was -- like, if I was living in San Francisco, I think I would have made quite a few more changes --
R:  Yeah, probably.
L:  -- than what I have in my life.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, I watched the news, like I -- I used to like, now I don't, but I used to watch the news, like everyday, like I would sit there, kinda I was like, crazy at the news, like, [MN] -- like seeing what was going on and everything.
L:  Now, is that before or after?  Septem- --
R:  This is after.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Like, right after it happened, I was like, glued to the TV, watching the news and everything, 'cause my dad worked, like cross street from there.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah, so we, like -- he, like -- I don't know -- he called us when it happened 'cause he knows I'm always worried like, 'cause I'm like, a worried person, like, I always worry and stuff, and he called us and he said that he was okay, but he said that he was like a mile away, but he was really across street --
L: Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, and some -- but someone, like, pulled him in, to like an apartment -- like, I don't [MN] -- like, he doesn't even know [several inaudible words] they just pulled him in, out of nowhere, and then they gave him, like, oh, like a blanket just to p- put over his mouth and stuff.
L:  [SIGH] Wow.
R:  Yeah, and like, he said that they -- I don't know if they're like guardian angels or something, I don't know if you believe in that, but he said that like, they took like ten people in, and like, he went back there like the next -- I think after a couple of days, when you could go back there, and they were gone -- so, he doesn't know like, what happened to them, but that was like, crazy.
L:  Oh, wow, I know that they had closed up a lot of -- they made people, yeah, move out for a period of time while all that stuff settled and everything --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- [MN] but, for me to see it -- the funny thing was, I was driving to work --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- when it happened, or, right after it happened, and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I have, you know, the news on and they're talking about, you know, the twin towers and people coming out and all this stuff, and I'm like, " [MN] Is it like the anniversary from when they had that bombing down in the basement part, you know --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- or wherever the trains were?"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because that's what I thought they were talking about --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and it wasn't until I got to work and somebody had the TV on, that I actually went, "Oh my god" --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, because I had no clue --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, I -- I got in the middle of the [MN] -- of the conversation, I didn't hear the first part on the news, where it said it had just been hit by two different planes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what I got in on, was the -- [MN] people are coming out and they're covering their faces and all that, and I remembered it from the news, you know, seven years ago, or eight years ago, or however long it was when they had, um, that bombing attempt down where the train station part was --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- or the garage part was.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  So --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- for me ah, like I said, [MN] being in California, the changes aren't --
R:  Yeah, so dramatic I guess.
L:   -- yeah, as dramatic.
R:  I mean, I ju- -- I really don't like to fly [MN] basically now, either.
L:  Oh, I -- I can see why on that, I mean, I've flown since then --
R:  Yeah, I haven't.
L:  -- and I -- and I had this little tiny, um, Swiss army knife, I mean, the blade on it is like an inch long --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- you know, it's just one of those little tiny ones that you use to cut open a package or something -- they took it from me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and then I was like, "But, wait, my dad gave that to me" --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and so I just happened to know one of the gals who, um, was at the screening --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I said, "You keep -- can you keep it for me?  And then when I come back from wherever I'm going, I'll -- I'll pick it up from you -- I'll call you", and she's like, "Sure", and I'm like, "Oh, okay" -- [MN] --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- I -- I still haven't picked it up yet --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but [LAUGH] -- but it was just the fact that they would take it and they don't even put it in a bag, or mark it with your name, or anything like that --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- so you can get the stuff back.
R:  They can't.
L:  Yeah, what they do is -- they were selling it on -- on ebay, in boxes --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- [MN] scissors, and knives and all this stuff, ah, that -- the airlines themselves were selling 'em -- it was stuff to g- -- to get rid of, or -- or they must have sold them s- -- to people who bought 'em in the boxes and then sold them on ebay.
R:  Yeah, maybe -- that's crazy. 
L:  Yeah, yeah, so I was just like --
R:  I mean, I don't wanna like, not, like, I'm not like, afraid of like, of going out my house or something, but I just don't wanna like, do stuff that I don't need to.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, you -- you just don't wanna put yourself in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- potential jeopardy.
R:  I mean, I -- of course in the future I wanna fly, I don't w- -- you know, but I just haven't, like, I mean, there's nowhere for me to go anyway that I need to fly.
L:  You -- right.
R:  So, it wasn't like I needed to -- I wasn't like, I didn't cancel any trip or anything --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I just haven't had any trips planned.
L:  Well, I mean, driving across any of the bridges -- like, the Washington Bridge over there, or anything [MN] --
R:  Oh, yeah, I've drove.
L:  -- [MN] and that doesn't freak you out at all?  With -- with --
R:  I mean, maybe for a second, but you know, like, what am I going to do?  Like, if I'm going to die, I'm going to die I guess.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  There's nothing I can do about it.
L:  [LAUGH] I wish I could do something about it, but I can't.
R:  Yeah, like if -- like I -- like I'm [inaudible] terrorisms and stuff, I used to be like, psycho, like, washing out and stuff, but like, what am I going to do?  I can't like, take over them.
L:  Right.
R:  There's nothing I can do about it -- I mean -- I mean -- I mean -- you hear the stories that like, some people that are like, crazy now with the Arabs, like, they're like [MN] -- like, think that all of them are bad and they like, just try to beat them up and stuff, but --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I mean, it's -- I mean, I'm not gonna like just, hate all them, I can't do that, I mean, I don't know ...
L:  Yeah, because, who's to say?  I mean, a lot of people mistake people from the Middle East from being from certain countries when --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- there's so many different small countries over there, you [MN] -- how can you tell by looking?
R:  Yeah, yeah, you can't.
L:  You know, "Oh, that's one of them", you know?
R:  [MN]
L:  Sort of thing.
R:  I mean, it's just like the German and the Jew thing, like, you can't hate all them, you can't -- you know?
L:  Right, right --
R:  It's like --
L:  -- that makes total sense.
R:  So, I mean, I mean, now look -- Jewish people don't hate Germans any more, so I mean, and -- I -- I'm guessing that like in ten years, or five years, [MN] like Americans are not going to hate all Arabs.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's gonna take time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and, [MN] who knows, I mean, there's still hard feelings from people who, um, ah, Pearl Harbor --
R:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- where they have the memorial over there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, that -- there will be Japanese ah, tourists, that go there, and they're talking in Japanese and laughing about something --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, th- there's been incidents where older men, who were -- who lost friends [MN] during that time, that they start a fight --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- because it's still so passionate for them.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  So, I'm sure there'll still be, in five years, ten years, fifteen years, people who may come across someone, that [MN] are at the memoriam that they're gonna put for, um, the twin towers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there'll be a person who ah, of um, Middle Eastern descent saying something, and someone's going to go off on 'em --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- [MN] You know [MN] -- I -- I wait to -- I'm, not like I'm waiting to see that happen, but I gotta nickel bet that it probably will --
R:  Of course, yeah.
L:  -- and [MN] ...
R:  I mean, I don't know, the -- it's just like, I don't know, I know some incidents where -- there were some Arabs like, [MN] on Long Island, like, my cousins, like their friends live next door --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they knew something about it, 'cause they said, "Don't go to work the next day", like -- like those kind of people, like, it's just like ridiculous, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, and how do you control them?  Because it's all based on emotion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and you can't say, "You can't feel that way" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because [MN] there -- there's no way to stop those feelings --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there's no way to go through and do that -- [SIGH] ah ...
R:  I don't know, I mean, it's -- I mean, I guess it made everyone in this country feel like, that we're not as safe as we thought we were.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, [MN] and the amazing thing was how united everybody became right after it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, everybody, all of a sudden were flying flags --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, had 'em stuck to their cars, and posted in their windows --
R:  Oh, yep.
L:  -- whereas before they -- they took it all for granted.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- I mean, I -- I kinda w- -- it's not good that anyone died, of course, but it's kinda good that we all now see that we're not so vulnerable, I ...
