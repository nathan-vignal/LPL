L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Good.  I'm doing well.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Ah, Dennis.  Yourself?
R:  Jonathan.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Jonathan.  Nice to meet you.  So, the topic --
R:  Is do you think athletes are, ah, capable, you know, worth what they think they are?  Worth, actually.  You know?
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  What do you think?  Do you think they should strike and stuff like that, you know, on the salaries they get?
L:  Well, in terms of the salaries they get, that's kind of a tough call.  Um --
R:  I agree with you on that aspect --
L:  Ah, you know --
R:  -- because there -- there -- there's no iron teams, know what I mean.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  They should have salary caps and bonuses like football does.
L:  Right.
R:  Know what I mean?  Football has actually does have like a salary cap.  They can't like, you know, oh yes so and so gets this much amount of money.  They get bonuses --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for certain things they do --
L:  I --
R:  -- and that's what they should have for baseball players too because how much is it a game now?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  I -- I -- I think that's -- that was the point that I was going to make, you know, the -- it's the fan that's really the one that loses out.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, right now, you know, because salaries are --
R:  Well, have you gone to a ball game recently?
L:  Oh yeah, sure.
R:  Okay, well --
L:  Beers are what?  Seven dollars now?  Sixty fifty.
R:  -- everything's -- I mean, of course you know, at least to have a good time at a ball game, um, you know, over a hundred dollars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what about the tickets?  I mean, like fifty dollars for -- for the food, and then another hundred dollars, and you're in the heat anyway, you need drinks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Do you know I -- I -- yeah, absolutely.  I -- I -- I think that salaries have gotten out of hand because ball players are saying, "Well, you know, we generate all this money for you", and then ah, at the end of the day I think the salary caps have gotten too big.
R:  Yes.
L:  And -- and so um --
R:  They -- they have no salary caps, ball players don't.  Basketball players don't either, depending on what they do.  But you mean, they'll have to -- I mean --
L:  A -- a team salary cap, though.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Each -- each team is designated a salary cap now.  But ah -- yeah, I mean, you know, it -- it's refreshing though to see what the -- have you been reading the ah, the headlines for the Lakers recently?
R:  No actually I haven't actually, and I apologize all round I haven't too much -- I mean --
L:  Well, I mean, there's -- there's two um, as of this last week, there was two players that have committed to playing with the Lakers, and they're perennial all stars.  Th- -- they -- you know, they're um, one is Carl Malone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the other guy is Gary Payton.  Both of them are, you know, ah, Gary Payton is like a nine time all-star and Carl Malone is probably, you know, twelve or thirteen.  And both -- Gary Payton signed for, I think about four million.  He could have gotten probably around, you know, eight or ten.  Carl Malone is going to play for one point nine million, I think.  That's an eighteen million dollar pay cut from what he would ha- -- from what he made last year with the ah, Utah Jazz, and I mean, they're just saying, "Well, you know, we're -- we're ending our career or we're getting towards the end of our career, and you know, we just want to get that title".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's about the love of the game and -- and trying to win, and that's kind of nice to hear.  Um, you know --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, they just -- you know, still get what they deserve and -- and they have a lot of capability and they just, you know, they're actually showing what, you know, it's for the love of the game guys, it's not the money.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I mean, and also too I can understand how they go for a certain amount of salary because, like, gee okay, he gets probably mauled by women all the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay, I mean, certain things like stars and they're under the category of stars.  That's exactly what they are.  They're in the limelight --
L:  Right.  And then you got --
R:  [several inaudible words] they are --
L:  And then you got [LAUGH] then they got players like Roger Sidanial that are getting, what, like ten million dollars this year, or however much he's getting which is absolutely insane.
R:  But I mean -- but I mean, they're not getting mauled.  They need -- they don't have security [inaudible] baseball players have security, I mean, their life isn't threatened and stuff like that.  You need that kind of salary to have yourself.  That's understandable.
L:  Well jeeze, you know, in our lifetimes i- -- i- -- if we can make, you know, two million dollars in -- in our earning career, that's more than enough for us to ah, to be secure in.  These guys make four million dollars a year as a bottom rung player, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, there's ah -- and they have to play for one year and they theoretically should be secure for the rest of their life, but of course they have their posse and all that and well --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- that's a whole different story. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Definitely a little bit disenfranchised with ah, with what these guys make.
R:  Yeah.  I agree with you.
L:  Um, but ah, I don't know.  Where -- where are you from?
R:  I'm from New York as a matter of fact --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I'm in the highest placed base- -- basketball, baseball, you know, teams there are.
L:  Likewise, I live in New York as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But ah --
R:  I just think it's insane though, I mean, I can understand, like, if you're a star.  I mean, you're a star you're in the limelight and you need security, you need to pay for these extras -- you know what I mean?
L:  I agree.  Look -- look at the Mets right now man.
R:  I mean, yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  People who -- I mean they're packing -- they're packing the stadiums.  I mean --
L:  Not any more.
R:  Yeah I know, man, but you know what I mean, they keep messing up, they fire people, they don't know what they're doing.
L:  I was reading this article, ah, the other day about the Mets and how awful they are, and ah, they were saying how Mets management should either reduce the price of a ticket or reduce the price of beer.  Because you definitely need a couple of beers to watch the Mets play now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [several inaudible words]
L:  What's that?
R:  Die hard fans [inaudible] I can tell you that much.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm a Mets fan through and through, and ah, it's been a tough year.  I'll give you that much.
R:  Yeah.  They're not doing too good right now, I can tell you that much.
L:  No.  Sounds like you're a Yankees fan.
R:  No [several inaudible words] you know this is like [inaudible] one side, it's just I'm not really that big enough sports fan.  I mean, I'm into sports but I grew up with like, ah, my father had racehorses so I -- I grew up in that kind of lifestyle.
L:  Right.
R:  So I mean, if the horse does good that's when the guy does good.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm sorry, you grew up with a what lifestyle?
R:  Um, like the horse like horses --
L:  Okay.  Sure.
R:  -- and like I follow it a lot, like I owned a couple of racehorses when I was a kid, so --
L:  Sure.  Cool.
R:  [several inaudible words] lifestyle thing, you know, sort of thing.  He wasn't really that big of a baseball fan when he was young, he just was you know, woodsy kind of person and he just liked watching the races.  That's what I grew up with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but I just think it's insane because, you know -- look how much they're making.  If I -- you know, if we make -- exactly as you were saying, we make how much for our salaries?  Two million if we're lucky.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Just to live a decent lifestyle.  Okay, they struggle in New York City if anyone lives in New York City as it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- okay, and the credit cards are like eighteen percent if you're luck- -- I mean if you're lucky you can get like one that's twelve percent for six months, you pay one off with the other and then you just -- and then how you going to go to a ball game?
L:  Yeah.
R:  To afford it.  You know they're generating that much money.  They're generating that much money from TV.
L:  How -- how do you feel about ah, player's strikes?
R:  I think it's, you know, well I'm a union guy, so I mean, I can understand that they have a strike, but what -- what are they striking about?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, there has to be, you know, like what are they not getting?  I tell you, they have a doctor on the field at all times.  I mean, when I'm out working, let's say I lose a finger, there's no doctor right there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Know what I mean?
L: I -- I agree.  I -- I -- I think that um, the caliber of player that's playing these days has really changed from, you know, what you had back in the fifties when -- back in the fif- -- forties and fifties these guys had -- played baseball in the summer and then they had another job in the winter, you know, and they played because they loved to play baseball, and they got played to -- or they got paid to play baseball --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, now, you know, these guys expect to be treated like royalty once they make the big leagues.  And ah --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- you know what I mean?
R:  Well it goes to their head sometimes.
L:  E- -- even if you're making, I -- I don't know what the league minimum is.  I -- I would guess that it's probably around either a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  That's a lot of money even so.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  And everything's a write off for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All their equipment.  I mean, fine, I understand they have to work but I work too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- okay --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I'm a construction worker, I don't know what you do, but I'm out in this heat, okay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I feel the heat, I'm not getting seventy thousand dollars a year and I'm doing something that there -- okay, fine, people might not -- not pay attention to it, but I mean, it's always going to be there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Know what I mean?
L:  I agree.  I agree.  I mean the -- the other sort of disenfranchising thing is some of these high school players that are getting signed ah, with minor league contracts, they get the signing bonuses of a hundred thousand dollars.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- I think that's, you mean like actually put -- that's what gives them the appetite[?]
L:  Well, I mean -- yeah, I mean.  Just think of fit this way though, if you an eighteen year old kid, you get a signing bonus of a hundred thousand dollars.  If you have half a brain, you'll put that into an investment fund --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and that -- that'll be your retirement fund.  I mean --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- you -- you still got another forty years in front of you and that -- that a hundred thousand dollars is going to increase by how -- x amount of dollars, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that's going to be your medical for the rest of your life.  It's all you need.
R:  Yeah.  Well I mean, you know, as I'm saying, you know, when Jeter got hurt on the field --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- okay that day, okay, I see that on the news.  Doctors are right there, okay, right away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's just like -- I think that was like, you know, if I get hurt, no one's right there for me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I have to wait like, you know, take a cab or wait for an ambulance --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not like right away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Know what I mean.  So I mean, how mu- -- would could they strike against?
