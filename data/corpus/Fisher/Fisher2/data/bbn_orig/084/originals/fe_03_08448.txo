R:  Terry Gardiner.
L:  Darren Bott.
R:  How you doing?
L:  All right.
R:  Did you make any changes after September eleventh?
L:  Um, um, I'm not sure.  No, I don't think so.
R:  [LAUGH] Me either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, what happens after ten minutes?
R:  Uh, we stop talking.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh right.  Man, I wish they could have called me on nine o'clock on the dot because I have the free minutes thing after nine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think they called me eight fifty five so I'm gonna get charged for this.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] That sucks.
L:  Yeah.  We gotta talk for ten minutes?
R:  Yeah, actually we do we have to talk about did we make any changes in our lives after September eleventh.  Personally, no.
L:  Uh, I don't think so, I mean, I take the, um, Path train in from Newark, New Jersey --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, like, they changed the route but --
R:  Oh, they did.
L:  Yeah, I -- because the thing is that the Path train used [NOISE] to go to, um, the World Trade Center but, um, you know, no longer. [NOISE] So ...  But, uh, you didn't make any changes?
R:  Personally, no.  The only changes that happened here, like, in Philadelphia --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is that for a while you couldn't go down, uh, Chestnut Street after --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Seventh Street.  They had it blocked at Sixth.
L:  I see.
R:  And all of the buses had to go, like, down Market Street.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, for the most part --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't look at people any different --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- [NOISE]
L:  I wonder how they're picking up our conversation here.
R:  I have no idea.
L:  I -- I didn't know what it would like because I thought I would be talking to a computer the whole time.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They, um, they connect you with other people about different topics like politics, um, and other stuff.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, I was -- I lived close to, uh, I live close to the, uh, city so I was -- and I was at my, um, at my university, um, when the towers fell.  So, that was pretty weird [NOISE], you know, seeing --
R:  Really?
L:  -- the towers fall.  Yeah.  It's surreal 'cause you get to see 'em from, like, uh, my dorm room window.
R:  Wow.
L:  And then they were gone so that was pretty nuts.
R:  I'll bet.  Yeah, I -- I was -- I was supposed to a, um, an appointment that day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I woke up later so I was making the phone call.  I had turned on the TV, let the dog out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and went to make phone call to tell them I'd be later and I got a message saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Traffords[?] was closed.  I turned around and looked at the television and they were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- showing the -- the towers collapsing.  I thought --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- "What the heck just happened".  So, I turned up the sound and they said, "Uh terrorists just took out the twin towers in New York".  I said, "What?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, through like several days that's all you heard.  I kinda got tired of it though.
L:  Yeah, it -- it -- well, it was kinda ridiculous, like, on TV they were showing that one footage of that guy falling from the tower --
R:  Yeah, and they kept --
L:  -- over --
R:  -- doing it over and over.
L:  -- over and -- and it was like, you know, watching -- I just became, like, so surreal, like, you know, Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know why they kept on showing it over and over again.  It must've been -- it was nuts.
R:  Didn't they find some people still alive in -- in the debris?
L:  I'm not too sure.  I mean, it had --
R:  I thought they found, like, two or three people that were still alive.
L:  Well, that --
R:  And then they started bringing out bodies which was white.
L:  [LAUGH] That's --
R:  And everyday --
L:  -- that's miraculous.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] I mean, when you think about it they should have known better, they tried to take out what the -- they tried to take that building before or was it the UN?  The garage?
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
R:  Like a couple of years before.
L:  Yeah, what was that ninety five.
R:  And they didn't stop and think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they didn't stop and think that somebody might try and do it again?
L:  Mm.
R:  And the weirdest thing that I heard after, like, um, it must have been about two weeks after --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of the guys that hijacked the plane --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was on the FBI's most wanted list and they knew where he was.
L:  [MN]
R:  That pissed me off.
L:  Yeah, that -- that's horrible.
R:  So, why in the heck didn't they pick him up?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And why didn't they listen to, like, this -- this, um, guy that, um -- this pilot that, um, chang- um, that gave flight lessons.
L:  Mm.
R:  When he called -- when he called the FBI and told them that three guys of Arab -- Arab descent, you know, were trying to find out about certain kinds of planes and how to fly 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he said they sounded suspicious so he called the FBI.
L:  You know, worse than that, um, like the Saudi government, like, I think it was a week before September eleventh, said that there is a very -- you know, a very high chance of them -- we've -- they said, "We've come by intelligence that there's a very high chance that there's gonna be, um, a terrorist attack in [MN] -- in America.  A very big terrorist attack in America within the next week".  They had that intelligence and that's just, like, you know, I mean, coming from Saudi Arabia --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is a -- it -- it's -- it's where most of this -- it's where, you know, you have a lot of this [inaudible] for terrorism come from and the country is saying, "All right, look, you know, in our backyard we're seeing this stuff and --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- it's gonna happen to America" it's kind of -- you know, that -- that was pretty nuts.
R:  But I've always thought we are so doggone arrogant.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, "Oh, it'll never happen here".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying.  They've gotta be crazy.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They should be, you know, almost more like -- now they're more aware of it and -- and they're doing overkill.
L:  Mm.
R:  When they should have said actually thinking of ways to protect American citizens from terrorists attacks --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- knowing good and darn well that there were people here that were known terrorists.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it was -- yeah, it's definitely, um, too little too late. [MN]
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Especially with this -- all right, I'm not too fond of, like, the new legislation like they have this Patriot Act --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where they can just put you in jail for, you know, how ever long they want.
R:  Yeah, or they can break down your door and check -- and -- and see if you're harboring a terrorist or if you're -- if you got any weapons.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I mean, I -- I can see --
R:  But have you noticed that little by little they chipping away our rights?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And nobody's really paying attention.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's -- 
R:  It shouldn't --
L:  I mean, th- that's like in the constitution, like, one of them is like section B seizure without a warrant, you know, one of the bill of rights and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's nonsense that this is happening.  Mm.
R:  To, uh, due process, just cause.  
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm like I wonder if anybody else is aware of all this stuff that they're doing.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And why aren't you listening to the news and -- 'cause I -- I've gone out a couple of times and I've talked with friends of mine in bars and stuff and I've said, "Have you noticed that they're chipping away at our -- our civil rights little by little".  And they said, "What are you talking about?"
L:  Huh.
R:  And I say, "Well ever since September eleventh haven't you noticed they've been making these minor legislative, um, laws --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- restricting our rights".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The fact that they can break down your door without a warrant.
L:  That's pretty much -- yeah.
R:  They can put -- [LAUGH] yeah, they can put you in jail without telling you why.
L:  I mean --
R:  All I'm saying --
L:  -- it -- it has such a potential for misuse.
R:  Yeah, this is true and they will do it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm sure it's just gonna come to like one gross violation of it and they're gonna have to like, say, "All right, we need to get rid of this".  It was definitely something that they need -- um, there needed to be some kind of security before September eleventh.
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  It didn't happen and now they're just -- it's like a -- such a --
R:  It's overkill.
L:  -- a reaction to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, overkill completely, you're right.
R:  And -- and now, let's see, I h- I hate flying anyways so there's no reason for me to get on a plane, I'd rather drive.
L:  Mm [LAUGH].  That's very true, yeah.  Um, but if you do go on a plane now and then they -- they do search you. [LAUGH] They'll put your shoes -- 
R:  I -- I  -- yeah, I know, make you take off your shoes.  Uh -- uh --
L:  They -- they scanned my shoes three times.
R:  They're supposed to have a new scanner, a walk through.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That shows everything.
L:  Right, but that's not there yet.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Uh, it's -- they hav- I think they have it in California --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and DC.
L:  Mm.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's, uh ...
