R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Patty.
R:  Ah, my name's Rhonda.
L:  Hey Rhonda.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].
L:  The top- --
R:  How are you today?
L:  Oh, I'm just fine, how about you?

R:  In Kentucky, okay.
L:  -- they just [inaudible] from one place to another, here, don't they? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Well, we're supposed to be talking about what, today?  Did you [inaudible] --
R:  Um, I think it was the salaries of professional athletes -- I kinda had a little trouble hearing the [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- the recording -- I --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- I heard the professional athlete, but, I believe it was the salaries and whether you felt they were, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too high paid, or ...or ...
L:  Yes, I think they are too high paid.
R:  [LAUGH] I think they are, too [LAUGH].
L:  Very much so.
R:  And, yeah, I think they are too, I think there's a lot of, um -- a lot of things in our society, a lot of people that do things that are very essential that don't get paid enough [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly --
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  -- a lot of blue collar workers do more than them athletes do.
R:  [SIGH] Right, right.
L:  So, and --
R:  And -- and I realize a lot of them --
L:  -- that's -- that's exactly what I, ah, w- -- used to be, was a blue collar worker.
R:  Mhm, I realize a lot of 'em work and train hard, and stuff --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- but I don't think they work [LAUGH] any harder than a lot of other people, so ...
L:  Me either, I mean --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I think they're just way overpaid.
R:  [SIGH] I know my husband is a teacher, and you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just -- we have a hard time getting by on just his salary -- I stay at home with our children [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it -- you know, it's just kinda hard to -- to do that on one income, but, you know --
L:  Oh, I know what you're talking about. 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Now, we're living on --
R:  So, do you -- you know, you --
L:  -- we live on a fixed income now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my husband and I both used to work, and he retired, so, when he retired, it wasn't too long 'til he got sick, so here I am [LAUGH].
R:  Oh [SIGH] ...
L:  So, he's had a stroke, so I'm at home with him, but we took everyth- -- you know, we worked every day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Up 'til then, him and I both did.
R:  [MN] Right [SIGH] --
L:  So ...
R:  Right, I know.
L:  -- if we'd of makes the kind of money that, you know, ball players and football players and whatever else, makes, we would be sitting on Easy Street.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Everybody would [LAUGH].
R:  Right, exactly --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I mean, and you know, you think about the people that pick up your garbage and stuff like that --
L:  Uh-huh --
R:  -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- how hard they work [LAUGH], and how well they get paid [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and then what's so crazy about it -- they just make five fifteen an hour too, most of 'em --
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh, most folks do.
R:  Really, I wasn't sure exactly how much, but I figured it wasn't enough [LAUGH].
L:  No, it ain't -- it's just the minimum wage.
R:  Right, so ...
L:  [MN] It's just -- it's unreal.  [several inaudible words] 
R:  [SIGH] And the thing of it is, a lot of the athletes, you know, their seasons don't last that long [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah [MN] --
R:  -- so, you know ...
L:  -- yeah, but you go thinking about it -- they pay 'em these high prices for promotions and stuff like that.  I'm on the phone girls, now shoo.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Go on girls, all three of ya.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] I got three seven year olds.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, granddaughter, or just ...?
L:  No, ah --
R:  Babysitting, or ...?
L:  -- one's my daughter and the other one's my daughter's girlfriend --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the other one's my puppy.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] But they all pester me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just like little [MN] -- but we, you know, I don't know much to say about sports, I'm really not into it too much, but I do know they do get paid too much.
R:  [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, it's um, [SIGH] you know, it's just hard- -- and then, you know, they pay -- that -- they charge so much, for -- for the sporting events anymore --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- just so they can pay their salary so much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that normal people can't hardly afford [LAUGH] --
L:  I know it --
R:  -- to go see those sporting events.
L:  I know, my husband --
R:  [MN] So ... [NOISE] 
L:  -- my husband likes to watch boxing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the -- on TV --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and he wants me to get the pay per view sometime --
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I said, "Honey, we can't do fifty dollars for one boxing match".
R:  Oh, is that how much it is?
L:  Yes, ma'am. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To just sit and watch it for two hours on TV, it's fifty dollars for that one program.
R:  [SIGH] I know, we're near Indianapolis and so we have like, [NOISE] um, a triple A type baseball team and stuff and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] even their tickets anymore are -- are -- are pretty expensive, I mean for a --
L:  Really?
R:  -- whole family -- there's four people in our family, so for all of us to go, I mean, it's just -- we just can't afford to do that kind of thing.
L:  Uh-huh, that's the way it is here, you know, I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then you have to go out to eat somewhere, so by the time you do that, and then go to a ball game too, you just can't afford it.
R:  Oh yeah, and kids always want the snacks, and ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they all -- so, we'll usually go out and eat a whole meal, for what you buy, a hotdog and a drink for there.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right, exactly, exactly --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I know, we have attended any sporting events this year, 'cause we just ...
L:  Ah, we did.  We used to back when, you know, he was working and I was too, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we don't do any more.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  He's not able to go and sit out there in that weather and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff, and -- the heat just about kills me, so I can't stand it either, but I don't mind sitting in the cold, I can get warm in the cold [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  We used to go to football games --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at a -- our highschool football games --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- watch the kids play --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we used to like that.
R:  Yeah, we go to some highschool -- my husband being in the school system --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he actually can get -- get us into the games free, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so the high schools [MN] -- although if you have to pay, the -- even the highschool games are kinda costly anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... [SIGH] 
L:  They charge you for everything anymore.
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.
L:  [MN] I know when I was a kid, ah, when I used to go to basketball games every once in a while --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they was like five and six dollars back then, you know?  [MN] 
R:  [NOISE] Right, right, exactly, and I know with -- last year we went to a spring training game, which you know, is not even really like [LAUGH] a real game, well, I guess it is, but [NOISE] um, down in Florida and it was quite expensive [NOISE] to -- just to go to that.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, you go to Florida, you gonna pay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's something else down there, now --
R:  Yeah, but it was just --
L:  Whew.
R:  -- spring training, you know, so ...
L:  I know.
R:  But, we were down there visiting relatives and we thought we would [NOISE] take, um, you know, our children and stuff, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, and, but yeah, it was [SIGH]--
L:  What part of Florida did you all go to?
R:  Um, Fort Myers --
L:  Oh, we went --
R:  -- area, so ...
L:  Yeah, we went to ah, ah, Panama.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah, Panama City.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Course we lived in Alabama at that time, too.
R:  'Kay.
L:  But ... I don't -- you know, around here -- we have a base -- football field right over here, like, what, two blocks from where we live at --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the place is packed and I think the tickets are, well, I think they're like fifteen, twenty dollars just to get in and see the game.
R:  And what I think is, you know [LAUGH], interesting is that these players will like go on strike, and they'll go --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, um, protest their contracts and all that, because they don't think they're making enough money [LAUGH] --
L:  I know it -- I'm --
R:  -- and you know, you or I, or anybody else, you know, like you said, if we had that kind of money, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] we would have it made and --
L:  Sure would, that's the --
R:  -- you know, and -- and they think that they don't get enough [LAUGH] -- at least some of them, I'm sure not all of them do --
L:  Yeah, I'm sure they ...
R:  I just wonder how many of them do it because they actually li- like what they're do- -- love what they're doing and [MN], or how many others do it because they have the ability and they like the -- the pay [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  That's what I'd like to know, too.  And most --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of it's probably just because they like the pay and they think they can get by with it -- as long as they can they will, too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] some of 'em's pretty good athletes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And my husband's an athlete [inaudible] so he could tell you everybody, but me, I'm not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, I still -- no matter what, even if I don't know nothing about 'em much, it don't mean that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know that they're overpaid [several inaudible words] --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], yeah, [LIPSMACK] well [SIGH], yeah, it definitely seems -- sometimes ten minutes lasts a long time, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it does --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- especially when you really don't know what to say about something.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When it's something we can han- -- you know, you know about it's different.
R:  Well, it, yeah, it all depends on your topic, it's just they -- they don't give you too many questions to talk about [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  You been doing this very long?
R:  Ah, this is my second call.
L:  It's my second call.
R:  [NOISE] Is it?  I think they only let you do, like, three, don't they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well I done -- my first one was about the family, ah, um ...
R:  Values?  Mine was, too [LAUGH].
L:  How you -- I like that, I like that conversation [inaudible] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause that's right up my alley, but --
R:  [NOISE] Right, yeah, [SIGH] yeah -- [NOISE].
L:  -- when it comes to sports I'm not too good at it, but I -- you know, like I said, everybody knows that they're paid too much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for what -- for what they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know they have to get out there, and they have to go -- and they have to travel and stuff like that [several inaudible words] --
R:  [SIGH] But you know, I mean, I know a lot of, um, businessmen who -- the area we live in here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- by Indianapolis --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we have a lot of people that we know that are businessmen and stuff, and they travel --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and they -- and um, they get paid decently, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I'm sure they don't get as -- paid as much as the athletes do [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-uh, no, uh-uh.
R:  [LAUGH] But they have to --
L:  That's one [inaudible].
R:  -- do a lot of travel and such for their jobs, and [MN] -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and stuff, [SIGH] so, but like I say, it's a shame that it's [MN] -- they've made it such that, you know, the average person can't ...
