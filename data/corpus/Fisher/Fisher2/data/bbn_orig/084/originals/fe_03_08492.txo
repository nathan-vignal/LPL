L:  Cindy.
R:  Amy.
L:  Hi Amy.
R:  Hi there, how are you?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, not too bad, and yourself?
R:  I'm pretty good too.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  So, where are you from?
L:  [SIGH] I'm -- I'm in New York -- 
R:  New York.
L:  -- where are you located?
R:  I'm in Nebraska.
L:  Nebraska, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  How'd you get hooked up onto this.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How'd you get hooked up onto this Fisher thing?
R:  Well, um, I subscribe to the refunding cents site --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's -- just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there were some people that commented about it, and they said it was a -- kind of a fun and interesting thing to do, so I signed up for it, and this is my first call -- how 'bout you?
L:  Oh, it's your first call, it's my third call.
R:  Is it?
L:  Yeah, I actually did it a while ago, I haven't done it in a while, and, um, I -- I kept missing the phone calls when they called me --
R:  Yeah, that's kind --
L:  -- and then they -- they stop calling you if you don't answer the phone, like, if it goes to your voicemail.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... they're pretty cool though.
R:  [MN]
L:  I already got paid, so you do get a check.
R:  Oh, good deal.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just thought it'd be kind of fun, and like, this, I don't normally get to talk to a New Yorker --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  -- so that's kinda cool.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  Well, what was the topic?
R:  It was professional sports, and like, do we agree with them when they go on strike, and if we think that they get paid too much.
L:  Yeah, they get paid way too much [LAUGH].
R:  I agree [LAUGH] -- it's kinda -- 
L:  They're little brats.
R:  -- I always think it's amazing how much they get paid for what they do, I mean, I love athle- athletes and athletics, but I -- they get paid way too much.
L:  They get paid -- they're like little brats -- they're like little kids.
R:  Yep [LAUGH].
L:  They don't get their way -- they act up, they kick, fuss and fight and they're like, "I want another million".
R:  Exactly, and then the people that usually make the most --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- end up doing something stupid -- they get picked up for something, and I think they have everything going for 'em --
L:  Yep. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and then they get caught for doing something, and then they're --
L:  Right, they get [several inaudible words] like, a murder --
R:  Yeah, they do something that's just -- [inaudible] --
L:  -- [several inaudible words] sexual, or whatever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's -- I mean, and I don't know, like, I know that Koby Bryant, he just got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- caught for supposedly sexually abusing -- you know, maybe it's not true, but it's like, why would you even risk --
L:  You know what it is, too?  It's people know that they have money, so people wanna, like, do all these lawsuits and stuff --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- so a lot of the times, like, I don't believe the girls.
R:  Exactly, I know, I think sometimes the -- the girls probably bring it on -- I hate to say that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being female --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I think we're probably more likely to say it, than a guy can say it, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we can say it, men can't [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, exactly, they'd be in big trouble if they would, but ...
L:  Exactly, but ...
R:  [SIGH] But, and the part about them going on strike, I think that's -- that would be ridiculous too, because if they don't think they're making enough money, like, I think that happened in baseball --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, a few years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like, that's crazy.  But ...
L:  It really affected the game too, like people didn't want to go to the games afterwards, and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- people got annoyed.
R:  Exactly, well, and you --
L:  The fans.
R:  -- might have noticed it more in your area, like, in Nebraska, we don't have a professional sports team.
L:  We have two.
R:  And so, it's kind of funny 'cause like our college team, is like, everybody just loves, you know, Nebraska Football, because we don't have a professional team.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you probably noticed how -- like, that baseball strike probably affected your area more than it did us here.
L:  Yeah, like, you know what, I would look at the games and the stands would be empty.
R:  Yeah, that's -- [inaudible] I guess that's a positive for the people and we're saying, "Hey, that's -- don't be going on strike when you're already making -- we don't feel sorry for you 'cause you're only making five million" [LAUGH].
L:  No, and when you go to these games you spend so much money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, I was a game on -- on Wednesday and I spent so much money --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and I didn't even have to pay for my ticket --
R:  How mu- --
L:  -- the ticket that I had was a fifty dollar ticket, and I spend over thirty five dollars just on crap food and parking.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Like, eating stuff, and you know?
R:  Like, how much does parking cost?
L:  Ten dollars.
R:  Man, I just cannot imagine that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The cost of living is so much higher ... that's crazy.
L:  I've paid like fifteen dollars visiting a -- a person at the hospital.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just to park?
L:  Mhm.
R:  See, like around here, well, I'm off the topic, but around here our parking lots are all pretty much, generally around -- especially a hospital -- free.
L:  Nope.
R:  So ...
L:  They squeeze every penny they can out of us here.
R:  That is crazy ... man.
L:  It is -- it's annoying too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what's the website you were talking about?  This -- this rebate thing --
R:  It's called refunding cents -- you should -- you -- you should go out to -- do you have inter- -- I'm sure you're on -- have internet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it's -- it's called -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- refunding cents dot com, or refund cents dot com.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And, it's just -- like, if you're in- -- if I don't know if you're into couponing or rebating or anything, but it's a website and you can subscribe to it, like, it's only a couple of dollars a month or something, and it's just -- people go out and post, like, good deals and -- and things like this, that you can like, sign up for, and, it's really interesting, I mean, it's -- and people from all over the United States [SIGH] do things, and then the girl that actually runs the site -- her name's Michelle -- she always puts out like different, um, codes for websites, where like, you know, ten off twenty dollar purchase, and everyday she updates, like, internet daily deals and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just kind of a fun place to go to look for -- 'cause I do a lot of shopping on the internet, so ...
L:  So, it's refund sites -- S.I.T.E.?
R:  It's refund -- R.E.F.U.N.D. --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] C.E.N.T.S. -- like refund cents.
L:  C.E.N. -- oh, refund cents dot com.
R:  Dot com, yep.
L:  I'm gonna sign -- sign up for it.
R:  Check it out.
L:  Yeah, no -- I'm gonna.
R:  'Cause it's -- it is a good -- and that way, all -- it's a -- it's like you can post back and forth to people, um, even, like -- there's one that's like a main site where everybody puts all the good deals on and then the -- the other site's like where people can just, you know, put -- it's kinda called off topic -- stuff where you can write whatever you want, but, yeah, it's refund cents -- so, refund and then C.E.N.T.S. dot com.  Go -- so, you'll have to check that out, and -- it's just really interesting --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and only for a couple of bucks, you know, a month that's worth it, 'cause I -- you save tons of money with the things she has out there, so ...
L:  [SIGH] How much does she charge to be, ah, a member on her website?
R:  You know, I don't ev- -- to be honest, I haven't -- I don't even know what it costs for sure per month -- it's been a while since I -- I did like a twelve month subscription or whatever, so, I'm not sure what it cost per month or whatever right now, but it's not very much -- it's only a couple of dollars I think a month.
L:  Mm -- [inaudible] check it out.
R:  But, [inaudible] and some of it's free -- some of the parts of her website are free, like, you can get into it without being, um, a subscription member --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so just go out there and check it out -- there -- once you go to that site, it shows -- it shows the thing that says, like, open to all, and you can get into -- anybody can get into that, and then there's some areas just for subscribers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, but -- it's interesting.
L:  But, well, this Fisher Price thing, my friend sent me an email, and she's like, "I did it", and then like, I felt -- like, the first time I signed up for it, I was a little un- uncomfortable, 'cause they were asking for, like, your social security and I was, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't like that --
R:  Yeah, I don't either.
L:  -- and there was another thing -- I was like, well, my friend did it, so I was like, I -- I guess I could do it, you know?
R:  Yep.
L:  But, I was going to like, [MN] bail out of the whole thing, and then when I told my boyfriend --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he was like freaking out -- he was like, "What do you mean, you put your social security --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- number ...", da, da, da, da -- [SIGH] I was like, "Yeah, but Sinaz[?] did it", and he's like, "I don't care who did it".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know, it's -- my sister signed up and so, that's why I was like -- I felt comfortable, 'cause she's usually pretty safe about that stuff, and so, I thought, well if she did it, I'm gonna be -- I feel comfortable too, and she -- she said she had a good time doing it too, so ...
L:  Yeah, no, it's pretty easy, and now I'm like, um -- and then I had to tell my friend, I was like, "Did you ever get the money?", and she was like, "No", and then last week we g- -- actually got the money from, like, two months ago.
R:  Well, good deal, so at least [inaudible] --
L:  And I was like, hey, that works -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause you're just, not even expecting it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It just comes in the mail.
R:  That's what's kinda nice, 'cause I mean, it's one of those things that's kinda fun to do [NOISE], and then, if you get paid for it, it's even a bonus.
L:  Yeah, right [LAUGH].
R:  But ...
L:  You're not that mu- -- you're not that hard to talk to really, [inaudible].
R:  No, you're ... [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it is kinda fun though to it, but --
L:  It --
R:  -- I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, I -- but, that's what was kinda nice about the site, 'cause people wrote in and said, "Oh, you know, you just talk to people, whatever, and no big deal ...", so, it's kind of fun.
L:  Yeah, it was, and usually you get those emails from people and you're like, "Whatever" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, when -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, like, if my friend wouldn't of told me that she did it, I wouldn't of paid any attention to the email that [inaudible] sent us.
R:  Yeah, exactly [LAUGH] -- 'cause you never know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- there's so many spam emails anymore and things --
L:  Aye.
R:  -- you just don't know what to trust, and ...
L:  If it says forward on it, I usually just delete it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hardly ever read it.
R:  That's about how I am too.
L:  And if it's an e- -- if it's in like an email account name that doesn't look like it's anyone I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or it looks like it's something that it shouldn't be, I don't ever open -- I just delete it.
R:  Yes.
L:  Unless -- unless, I look at and I'm like, "Wait, that could be somebody's ..." --
R:  [LAUGH] A lot of times I'll just do a quick scan and most of 'em, it's like, ah, delete, delete, delete, but ... [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's like now I gotta close down an account 'cause I get so much junk on it --
R:  I know.
L:  -- that I couldn't even --
R:  We have one of those --
L:  -- I couldn't even have anybody send me email anyway.
R:  We have one of those too, and we -- and I literally will get thirty to forty junk mails at least a day, and I don't know how -- for some reason that account got put out somewhere and it's just cra- -- and then it's -- there's some bad stuff, you know, it's just like, oh my goodness.
L:  Yeah, like porn.
R:  Yeah, it's like [inaudible] -- oh, it's just sad, but ...
L:  Yeah, like, "Wanna hang out with a nineteen year old?", "Wanna go with a thirteen year old?", [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
R:  I know, it's disgust- -- you wish that you could figure out who was sending them to you so you could report 'em, but oh, it's just --
L:  Yeah, do you have AOL?
R:  No, I don't actually.
L:  Yeah, I have AOL and I don't think they do a very good job, like, scanning our emails.
R:  With like the filtering?
L:  For viruses, and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and spam, and -- they don't do -- they don't, like, that's where my -- when I -- where I get all the junk is that -- [MN] an AOL account, but like --
R:  Really?
L:  -- even like, my hotmail account -- they always check before they open, like, any email that -- if it has any viruses --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's nice.
L:  Me- meanwhile AOL always -- "Do you know this person?  If you don't know them, don't open it", you know?
R:  [LAUGH] And it's like, "Okay, well, that doesn't necessarily do me any good".
L:  Right, exactly.  
R:  [MN] 
L:  But I like the fact that the other ones check for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for viruses before they open it.
R:  Definitely.
L:  And those are free.
R:  Yeah, the hotmail is -- I know, and AOL is what you're pay- -- I, ah, I don't know -- that's something we -- I've just never used AOL and -- I've had a bunch of opportunities, but I just go through our local provider here in Nebraska, and we've just always used them.
L:  Well, AOL used to be the only one before.
R:  It did, it was the main one, I know.
