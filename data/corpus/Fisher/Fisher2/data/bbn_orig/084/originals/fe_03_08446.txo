L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello, my name is Jason.
L:  Hi, Jason, I'm Becky [NOISE].
R:  Hiya, Becky.
L:  Have you made any changes?
R:  Have I made any changes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, a few.  Um, since I live --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in New York I --
L:  Oh my gosh, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Understandable.
R:  Then everything -- everything, uh, you don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't take, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things for granted in the same way.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and, I mean, certainly riding the subway --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is probably one of the -- as -- as I've told friends of mine who live outside the city, it's probably one of the times that I feel the most vulnerable.
L:  I would think so, you're underground [NOISE] and you're encased and [LAUGH] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  No kidding, oh.
R:  And it's a shame because you're sort of always, kind of looking around.  I mean, the truth is I don't do it as much now but -- but certainly in the -- in the months right afterwards --
L:  Yeah, I would think --
R:  -- that's was much more --
L:  -- it -- you're awareness --
R:  -- on people's minds.
L:  -- somewhat goes down as things seem to settle down a little bit more.
R:  Exactly, and, um --
L:  Gosh, living in New York, that has to be rough. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well, it's interesting because you sort of just -- I don't wanna say take it in stride but --
L:  Right --
R:  -- you -- you sort of just --
L:  -- oh, New Yorkers are like that though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well you sort of just realize that -- that anything can happen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kinda just take it on faith that most people aren't that way, um --
L:  Nope, that's right.
R:  But -- but certainly the -- the big revelation after nine eleven was just realizing how vulnerable we are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and sort of shaking in the sense that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this is a country where these things couldn't happen --
L:  Our freedom, we pay for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  That's why -- well, it's affected my life [NOISE] that's for sure.
R:  How so?
L:  My husband's in the military so what he does is -- goes a lot more.  He's gone now and he's in Iraq so [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can see that -- that -- that's a -- a direct affect of terrorism.
R:  Wow.
L:  And he's been gone, oh, I don't know how many times [NOISE] as a direct result of nine eleven.  Probably at least six.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  He left directly after nine eleven to -- uh, I'm trying to think what their mission was then.  It was air control of some sort, you know, running airports --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- via satellite [NOISE] and he went to, um -- they went and did surveillance at -- surveillance around President Bush's house and --
R:  Wow, yeah.
L:  -- they've done all kinds of stuff.  And he's been gone quite a bit --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- as a result of it.
R:  -- I mean, it's a shame 'cause, you know, you sort of -- a- a- a- I -- I teach and I tell my students, I mean, it -- it realize that, um, I mean, there's -- there's this whole other level of -- of thinking about security now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that -- that --
L:  Right, well it affects --
R:  Before you could just say --
L:  -- people like that.
R:  -- things were -- well, you know, they were good people and bad people and now you realize well the bad people [LAUGH] are all among us and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, you don't know --
R:  -- and it's like --
L:  -- who it is --
R:  Right, it's --
L:  -- you know, you d- you don't --
R:  -- it's like a --
L:  -- it -- it takes a -- a level of trust that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you might have had before.  Or things that you took for granted if nothing else.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, it -- it affects a lot of -- it affects me in -- in the area of time because we're on a military base a lot and you don't get on like you used to, you sort of drive on, you know, with a sticker and now you have to stop and there's all kinds of barricades and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's still like that.  There's always a lot more security everywhere you go which is -- I'm not -- I'm thankful that because, I mean, the last thing you want is somebody to drive on, you know, with a -- a load of munitions on a truck [LAUGH] or something and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- blow your family up but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- at the same time it does affect everybody and it's a tie -- you know, as much a tie as anything else --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and living around it in a military area there's a lot of -- a lot more awareness of it, you know, 'cause we have such a large population of them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it affects people in that way just because a lot of spouses are gone.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, it's a -- it's -- I -- I guess it makes -- it sort raises the level of uncertainty too 'cause --
L:  Right, right, you don't ever know.  You always here all these different things on TV about how it might -- you know, they're always talking about one thing or another, they're -- you know, but I get to hear about a lot of stuff other people don't get to hear because he gets a lot of intelligence briefings and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't like hearing it [LAUGH].
R:  Well, it's like --
L:  You know, I don't -- I live with it, I'm used to it but it's -- you know, there are a lot of things that happen that people don't know about.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And probably prior to this there was a lot of things that, you know, our government knew that people didn't know and we might -- in a way it's okay if they've got it under control but it's still scary when you hear about it.
R:  Well, I think that's a thing that -- that most people have difficulty accepting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is that -- I mean, they so, "Oh, they're --" you know, we heard rumors that this could have happened before --
L:  Right.
R:  -- nine eleven, why didn't they do anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what they don't realize is there were thousands of these rumors --
L:  They're -- all the time.
R:  -- a yeah.
L:  It -- it is all the time.
R:  And a friend of mine is on the police force in New York --
L:  Oh, I can imagine.
R:  -- and he says, you know, the number of things that are going on daily --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and they were going on before nine eleven.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  You know, bomb threats and a lot of times --
L:  And there were things before nine eleven, I mean, that's --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- that's been, like, the biggie but, I mean, th- this happened before.  It's not the first time.
R:  Well, we hear about the things that -- that were successfully accomplished --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- there's probably gazillions of --
L:  Not all the other things that were --
R:  -- things were they either catch them or -- or --
L:  Right, or averted, right.
R:  -- stopped at the planning and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, even last week there was -- or -- or actually a few days ago there were there three teenagers in New Jersey who --
L:  Oh, the gun thing.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And now the father's just saying oh he's got the -- the mind of a twelve year old or something like that.
L:  Same sort of mentality, let's mak an excuse for --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- him [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  But, basically, you know, a -- the fact that they had guns period I, you know --
L:  Right, does it affect your job in any way?  I mean, where you work.
R:  Um, getting people to talk about it more, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- is probably one of the biggest ways just -- just --
L:  Well, did -- did you have anybody that it affected directly [several inaudible words] I even have -- actually have a friend that lost an aunt.
R:  I did not know anyone, it's amazing.
L:  It is.
R:  I did not know anyone who was directly killed by it, however, a friend of mine worked on the thirty second floor and he stayed home that day --
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  -- 'cause he was sick.
L:  Oh, I bet he's so thankful.
R:  Um, I -- I --
L:  But he's still would feel a sense of -- you know, a huge sense of loss, you know, like --
R:  Yeah, there were two students at our school who were killed who -- who were working part time down there --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- and were there that day.
L:  That's awful.
R:  And then, um, I mean, there are neighbors, you know, every --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you're always -- y- y- --
L:  You're always hearing about somebody or --
R:  -- one or two degrees of freedom away from folk who -- who had loss and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, I mean, just walking around the city there -- there's a hospital near me, St. Vincent's Hospital --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, has -- was one of the places when people in the days afterward were looking for survivors --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and loved ones, you know, there was all this uncertainty about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- who was still around and who wasn't.  They've actually left a permanent wall, um, will all sorts of notices and people are feel to come up --
L:  [NOISE] Oh and post things?
R:  -- and leave flags and things.  And it's actually -- I mean, it's beautiful but it -- it's just harrowing because you --
L:  Sad, yeah, that would be --
R:  -- realize what's behind it all.
L:  -- it's kin- it's like going to a memorial in a sense, isn't it?
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, that would be very -- very depressing for me [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I mena, one of the big changes --
L:  It re- represents -- represents human life, you know, and people's lives and people that they've known and loved and touched, um, there's a -- you know, you look past just the -- the outside of it, you look into the depth of it, it's really -- it's -- some -- and how it touches somebody's life is just sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, people don't realize that, you know, and they -- they forget.  You see it as a big instant but there's just so many little biddy elements of it.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.  And --
L:  I love to watch all the stories of just the families and everything -- I don't love it as far as, you know, being something I -- I relish but I -- I -- I like to see, you know, the after -- the good parts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and how people have helped other people and -- like the firefighters and all that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just have total respect for anybody who's willing to risk their life.
R:  Oh absolutely.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, I mean, they -- they were just basically made, you know, absolute heroes.
L:  Well, they should be.
R:  Which they are any time --
L:  They are --
R:  -- anyway.
L:  -- uh, everyday, right.
R:  Right.  I mean, it's sort of like the military but -- but firefighters in particular --
L:  Right.
R:  -- their whole job is going to places where --
L:  Risking your life.
R:  -- an emergency's already happened that --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and just really risking their lives, exactly, so ...
L:  Yeah, that gives you there, living there, actually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a bigger -- a bigger picture.  I mean, we can all see on TV and, you know, see how it might affect our life in another place but still just being there, I mean, I -- I've never been to New York --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so I can't say I can relate.  And that's horrible to say that I've never been there but I haven't. [LAUGH] I'm just southern and I stay in the south, I guess.
R:  Sure.
L:  But, you know, I -- I've known a lot of New Yorkers, actually I've gone to school with quite a few when I was in Ohio but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they're -- they're an -- they're different folks.  You know, they're a different breed.
R:  Well, the big irony is New York sort of was beginning to lose a lot of it's crime mystic 'cause it -- it had this big reputation especially in the early nineties as --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being, you know, lots of crime and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then actually it became -- it -- now it's very safe. [NOISE] I mean, certainly I've never -- you know, I've lived here twelve years and I've never, ever seen anything.
L:  Is that right?
R:  And I've nev- and I --
L:  In what part of New York?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  What part?
R:  I'm in Manhattan.
L:  Oh, well that's the nicest part --
R:  And I've even been --
L:  -- of New York.
R:  -- on the subway at three, two or three in the morning and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the secret is as long you're around other people, you're fine.
L:  Right, don't find yourself alone.
R:  And the thing about New York is there's so many people it's very easy to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the street, you know --
L:  I would think it'd be hard to be alone in New York [LAUGH].
R:  -- around other people.  Well, that's the challenge.
L:  It's like being in Tokyo or, you know, any other big city, I mean, we've been [inaudible] I thought I'd never see a spot that was empty, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Big cities are like that but, yeah.
R:  But it's amazing because people seem to just take it stride, like, when they closed the Empire State Building --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the tourists were --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  -- were disappointed but everyone said, "Well, if that's the way it's gotta be --"
L:  That's the best thing.
R:  "-- that's -- that's it".
L:  Right, you're not gonna get upset about it they're only trying to protect you.
R:  No, and it's funny because before nine eleven you heard all these stories about road rage around here --
L:  Really.
R:  -- like and people honking and getting out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of the cars and coming to blows.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't hea- you don't hear about that anymore.
L:  They -- they've learned that there's a lot more important things in life than being first.
R:  Exactly, well, and there are road blocks all the time that, uh, they --
L:  Yeah, and it's part of --
R:  -- they shut down, um, the Holland Tunnel last --
L:  The Tunnel, right.
R:  -- week, because someone found a -- a suspicious substance --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't even remember on -- on the street or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It turned out to be sugar but, um --
L:  [LAUGH] But better safe than sorry.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Um, and, you know, I think people here just are a little more, you know, forgiving if anything --
L:  I would hope so.
R:  -- which is a --
L:  That -- but that's a good --
R:  -- which is a good thing.
L:  -- that's one good thing that comes out of something like that, a tragedy.  There's always something good that comes out it and positive.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, unfortunately you have to pay such a price for it.
R:  Well, and of course, I mean, I -- some of my students are from the Middle East and I don't know if --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they've a let up in, like, the suspicious attitude that --
L:  Yeah, and that's --
R:  -- people give them and --
L:  -- always hard.  Yes, we have some Middle Eastern people here that have gotten [LAUGH] harassed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and, I mean, I -- I understand it from the one point of view you wanna blame somebody but, you know, not everybody has that mentality and not everybody's, you know, gung ho kind of militant kind of people, they're just not like that.
R:  No, I mean, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the reality is most of them don't have that attitude.
L:  No, and a lot of them --
R:  But --
L:  -- are not even religious in -- in -- in the Islam ...
