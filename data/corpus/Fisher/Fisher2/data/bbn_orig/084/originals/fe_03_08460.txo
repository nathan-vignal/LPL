L:  Hi, I'm Kate.
R:  Hi, I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi Debbie, how you doing?
R:  Okay, where you calling from, Kate?
L:  Oh, I'm calling from St Louis -- where are you -- where are you at?
R:  Oh, I'm near, ah, right Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so I'm in, ah, [MN] well, near Beaver Creek, Ohio.
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah, so what --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- changes do you think have happened?
L:  Um, I think they said in our own lives, right?  Like, um, well, [SIGH] I mean, for me, I haven't really -- to be honest, I've actually like, been on the plane more since September eleventh that any [inaudible] thing before in my life --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but that's because I'm -- I'm not from St Louis, I'm from up state New York --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um, I moved down here -- I was actually set to move out here September twelfth [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and I was -- and I was flying out here, too, um --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- so that was the first change, was that I couldn't fly out here when I was supposed to, um, but then I moved out -- I actually flew out here a week to the day [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- and ah, so really I didn't change anything, I mean, except for right then, and then, um --
R:  Now, how about your awareness, though -- were you a little more nervous?
L:  [MN] Yeah, I think so, I mean -- I -- well, I mean, even like practically, like I did think about what I was bringing in my bags, and like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, all the little things you can't bring, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, tweezers and random things, um, and then I did -- I was [MN] -- I was more nervous, I mean, when I went to the airport, um, the eighteenth, I had to, ah, go in there and like, ah, my -- my dad was going to be coming with me and he didn't -- he was going to go in with me but he couldn't, and um, there was a National Guard guy outside in his uniform and he said, "Are you going on the plane?", and I said, "Yeah", and he said, "You're brave", [LAUGH] -- and I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that was a little freaky [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Like, thanks a lot, buddy, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, exactly, and when I got in the airport there was hardly any people and I -- I did -- like you're saying, like, I was a lot more conscious of who was around me and what was going on, although, you know, I wasn't trying to look for a certain type of person or -- you know, I mean, I might have, subconsciously been doing that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but um, I was trying to [MN] -- I was trying to force myself to not think about -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what people look like, or --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you know?
R:  That was pretty fresh, too.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but, um --
R:  Yeah, you know the -- my -- my husband works for the government, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he -- he's in intelligence --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, it's -- it's [MN] really affected us and the funny thing is, my parents were gonna plan a -- a trip to Washington at the end -- well, in three weeks actually we're taking the family to Washington --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my mom's all, you know, "Well, you shouldn't be going ...", and, you know, and -- and I said, "Well, Mom, actually, the security's better --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- than September eleventh because they've heightened security, they're -- they're looking for things more --"
L:  Yes.
R:  "-- and, ah, in some ways, it's safer".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so, I -- I think in that way, it's -- it's been good for us, 'cause we needed to be, I think, a little more aware --
L:  Of what's going on.
R:  -- of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right, and as a family -- I have three kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, for their sake, I needed to be a little more, especially -- I have two girls --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just needed to be a little more, ah, careful --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- about where they are, what they're doing, who they're with --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, I was like that anyway [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think it -- I think September eleventh really did affect that, for me.
L:  Yeah, I think that -- I think it did for everybody I mean, and actually I -- [SIGH] I don't know, I mean [SIGH], like you said, like, I think it changed more things for me mentally than anything else, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I [MN] -- I know, like, in those first weeks, especially, I mean, I had just come out of college, um, in May, um -- I'm twenty four now and I was -- so, I was twenty two, and um, and I was set to come to St Louis to do Americorps[?] out here, and um -- Americorps -- have you heard of it?
R:  No, what -- what is that?
L:  It's -- it's just like the Peace Corps, but it's in the United States.
R:  Oh, yes, I have, I'm sorry, I'm sorry --
L:  Yeah, no, that's okay, um --
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  -- yeah, so I was set to come out here to do that, and [SIGH] I think, for a while, I was really like [SIGH] -- I mean, when I first was deciding -- [MN] I kind of actually had to decide whether I still wanted to come or not, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- at first, 'cause I was flying out here, and I was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, that could of stopped me but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, I didn't let it stop me, and then, when I got out here, [MN] I think what it changed for me most of all was I really felt like it was so important to do, like, what I was about to do, you know, to like help out in our country, where like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's so many problems here.  I think for me, like, even though everyone started becoming more nervous about, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- outside forces and things, I started thinking about how, we, you know, even though that's like the primary emphasis right now, there's a lot of problems in our country [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  That make people -- in -- in some ways that -- that breed that sort of contempt, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah, I agree.
L:  And, I think, um, for me, it definitely heightened my sense of responsibility to my own country and to, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing what I can to -- and also to present myself if I ever go -- I -- I have been abroad, I was in India for a semester --
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  -- yeah, and I -- ah, that's the only place I've been abroad actually, but, um, it did give me a sense of, like, how important it is as a society to portray ourselves as we want to be, you know, seem to others.
R:  Right, well and it -- it makes you realize how blessed we are, to go somewhere else.
L:  Oh, definitely, yep.
R:  You know, 'cause we're a very spoiled country --
L:  Yeah, we are [LAUGH].
R:  -- and -- and I think maybe we took our safety for granted --
L:  We definitely did.
R:  -- pretty much -- you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  And -- and I'm sure in India you saw -- people talk about poverty here, and I -- I know we have kids that are still hungry and --
L:  Oh, yes, yes.
R:  -- and things in this country, but they need to go to another country and see what they're living with.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And not being able to get medicines for -- for their family, and -- and things -- that's -- to me, that's real poverty [LAUGH].
L:  Yep --
R:  You -- you --
L:  -- and I -- and I do think, like, [MN] like -- in that sense, like, I mean, I haven't -- I guess I haven't taken enough steps necessarily along these lines, but I think it does [SIGH] make me feel like, you know, we need to, as a society, as a country, like, give more -- you know?
R:  Well, actually I'm kind of --
L:  [MN] And give more f- -- give more freely, you know?
R:  I -- I'm kind of impressed that someone of your age is that, ah, aware and serious, ah, about it.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know, because, frankly when I was that age [LAUGH], I was pretty oblivious, I was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I was pretty -- and now I'm very [MN] -- I'm very into what's going on in politics, and trying to ke- keep up with who's, you know, voting for what, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and one of my best friends works for a, um, committee in Washington, where she, um, makes sure she stays on top of certain issues and stuff, and so she's really into it, so, then of course she emails me [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it -- but it's -- it's neat to hear that you're -- that you really care about that.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  So ...
L:  -- yeah, for me, it just -- [MN] I guess it just [SIGH] sort of came natural, because my -- even my um, undergrad degree, it was in international relations and --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- I've always been -- so I've always been fascinated with, like, other cultures, and because of that I would always, like, kind to be kind of critical of our society, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, I don't know, like, I guess ...
R:  Maybe, it sounds like it gave you a little bit of an appreciation.
L:  Yeah, it did, it did.  I mean, it gave me -- it -- that's -- that's what I mean, like, it gave me an appreciation for it, and also kind of a -- a sense of like the duty we really have, you know --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the world, like, considering how much we do have [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  And like, how some -- like you said, how so many places, people don't have that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I think, um -- and I -- I think that's one of the greatest -- one of the most positive things it did for a lot of people in our country is -- is open their eyes to the rest of the world, you know?  Unfortu- --
R:  Yeah, well, and the -- and the thing is, a lot of people in other parts of the world are trying to get here.
L:  That's right [LAUGH].
R:  You know?  
L:  Yep.
R:  And people in our own country who have been here, are -- are saying, "Well, yeah, yeah, -- I'm just gonna go somewhere else", you know, and I feel saying, "Okay, you go somewhere else, and you go see what it's really like out there", you know?
L:  Yep, yeah.
R:  And, ah, so, yeah, that's -- that's neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, are you, um, ah, single?
L:  Yeah, yep.
R:  Are ya?  Well, that's -- that's -- there's a lot of things you can do [MN] when you're single.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] No, seriously --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, that's kinda neat, you can probably do a lotta things that you won't be able to, you know, later if you get married.
L:  That's true, you know --
R:  So ...
L:  -- 'cause you could just move so much more freely.
R:  Oh yeah, I was a -- a missionary kid --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I had thought of doing [MN] something like what you're doing, and then I met my husband when I was twenty one [LAUGH].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, little -- [MN] lots of little things change like that --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- so I'm an ambassador now to my three kids [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  And ah, now, but I, and I work with youth a lot, so --
L:  Mhm, what do you do?
R:  So, I um, ah, am a youth counselor.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Yeah --
L:  So, did you notice --
R:  -- yeah, so I --
L:  -- did you notice any changes in the kids, like in their reactions to anything, or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, the -- the kids were really frightened --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I saw a lot more fear, and worry --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there, and I'm a Christian too, so, um, I kind of approach things from that perspective you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and help them to -- ah, try to help them to see that there's a bigger ...
