L:  Hi, I'm Anne.
R:  Hi, I'm Katie.
L:  Hi Katie.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You wanna give your opinion first?
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Um, [MN] I think that the strikes are ridiculous, in my opinion.
L:  I'd have to say I agree with you.
R:  And I -- I -- I also think they're really overpaid.
L:  [SIGH] I -- I'd have to agree with you on that, too.  I think it's all gotten blown out of proportion.
R:  Yeah, I know, as an average American, I mean, I don't -- I just think, you know, it's ridiculous, like, what they make.
L:  And then they're crying about it, right?
R:  Yes, and they're striking.  I'd love to be able to strike [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Right, "I'm not getting enough millions -- I need more" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yes [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And they commit crimes and everything else.
L:  [SIGH] Right [MN].
R:  And yet, if I committed h- -- you know, even just one of those, I'd be in jail for the rest of my life.
L:  [MN] It -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it just doesn't seem fair, does it?
R:  No, it doesn't.
L:  [SIGH] Because they have fame because of their athletic ability [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I guess their luck in life [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, here they are, yeah, how tall they are -- how good they are at what they do.
L:  Or, who their parents may be.
R:  Yeah, exactly -- where they're from, who sponsors them [LAUGH].
L:  Right, if they have good promoters.
R:  Yeah, that's all it's about -- their agents, their managers.
L:  [MN] I -- I think it's really silly that they [MN] even bring up strikes, but maybe that's their way of trying to fight for, you know, and make sure that they at least keep their salary where it's at, at least.
R:  Or, maybe it's their way to get us to watch 'em, I don't know.
L:  That could be true.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], because honestly, if they weren't striking, I'd probably forget about 'em after a while [LAUGH] -- some of 'em.
L:  [SIGH] Well, to be honest, I didn't even know they were striking, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  The only reason I know is because I watch the nightly news, so, the sports scenes, and some of 'em are in the headlines, but, I pay more attention to the college ones, like the murder trials and stuff -- the professional ones, I get bored with.
L:  [SIGH] You know, it gets a little bit repetitious with [MN] -- with the dumb things that they do, um, [MN] the crimes that they do that are just ridiculous.
R:  It's like, okay, come up with something a little more original.
L:  Right, or, I mean, they just aren't very realistic in any -- in any aspect.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  [MN] Whether it c- -- be women, or money, or ...
R:  No, and they're all divorced, very soon, if you've ever noticed that.
L:  Right [MN].
R:  That's another thing, the divorce rate -- and a lot of them are not married.  [MN] And, I mean, I would wonder why -- if I saw my husband out striking 'cause he's not making enough millions, I'd be like, "Oh, my gosh".
L:  "Honey, just come home and sit down" [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, exactly [LAUGH].
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].
R:  I'd be like, "Okay, it's -- that's fine, you know, at least you got a million" [LAUGH].
L:  Right, that's plenty.
R:  [LAUGH] It's enough for me [LAUGH].
L:  I guess, it's [MN] one of those things where they take it for granted, and [SIGH] -- and they get a little bit too accustomed to what they have, or -- and I also think it's part of [SIGH] "Well, this one got thi- -- well, he got this, how come I didn't get this?".
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely -- when new ones sign on, I've noticed they strike [SIGH], they all strike --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it never ceases to amaze me, or if they get extensions on their contracts, or they get this promotion or Nike takes this one, then all of a sudden they're striking.
L:  Right, and everybody's bidding on [MN] the new players, and it co- -- you know, the competition is there and then the old ones wanna strike because they don't feel like it's fair.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN] ...
R:  But, a lot of companies are now going to overseas to get, um, people for commercials -- I don't know if you've seen that?
L:  I wish they would just stop that anyway.
R:  I don't think that's right, and I mean, I -- I personally, I don't agree with that.  I think we should keep the money in America.
L:  Right, we've already lost --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a lot of money [LAUGH].
R:  We -- we lose a lot of men, I mean, it's fine if we're fighting a war [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  As is military [SIGH], but, and I don't agree with everything that's going on right now, but [SIGH]-- and then to make it even worse, we're paying foreigners --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to do stuff that --
L:  That's kinda where we're at -- we're -- I'm in North Carolina, and we've lost a lot of jobs to overseas, so, ah, yeah, I don't think it's cool that they [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- do anything overseas [SIGH], in fact we send a lot of our money overseas, don't we?  And we send a lot of our men over there to fight for people overseas, and --
R:  Oh, yeah, and then how do they repay us?  They take the jobs [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  That's all they do, and like, here in Florida, a lot of people come in, and like, you know, from Cuba or South America, and they can get jobs.  Why?  Because, they're foreigners.
L:  And because they settle for less.
R:  Exactly.  And they'll do anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And, I often wonder about these women, they'll do anything [LAUGH]. You know, it's like, what will they do?
L:  Right.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's a little scary.
R:  It's like -- and their English isn't that good, and, it's like, they don't have degrees, or they haven't -- they don't have the work experience, and -- I -- I just don't think it's right.
L:  That's like in any border city though, like, you know, Texas, and California, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- any -- any place -- any of the States that border around Mexico and Florida, you know, with the Cubans not being that -- that far away --
R:  Oh, it's horrible -- I -- I was -- I was thinking it wouldn't be that bad being in Jacksonville, but it's -- it's pretty bad [LAUGH].
L:  Jacksonville -- is that the top, or the bottom?
R:  It's at the top, and -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- right near Georgia, and I did not think it would be this bad [MN], but --
L:  Do you guys have the Coke music pro- promotion there?
R:  Um, I don't know, actually.
L:  [LAUGH] We're trying to find it -- my sister lives in Savannah.
R:  I'm not sure, I know Savannah's like, right near here, but [LAUGH] -- I'm not sure.
L:  It's not in Georgia.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, anyways --
R:  [MN] But --
L:  -- back to the strike, we ...
R:  But, the strikes, I mean, I just think -- I think it's ridiculous.
L:  I think that they need to really take a look at the situation.
R:  I think they need to learn what really matters in life.
L:  And because they're replaceable, I mean, it's proven every time that --
R:  Somebody'll settle for less.
L:  Right --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's proven every time they sign somebody else on, and they -- I mean, if you ha- -- if you'd noticed, they've expanded on their, um, [LIPSMACK] recruiting, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to the hi- -- in -- in high schools it's a lot easier to get recruited -- you hear a lot more about it, anyways [SIGH], and I think that it -- maybe, I don't know -- maybe that's why they do strike, because they want to know their value.
R:  And I mean, that -- that might be it, maybe -- maybe they're just -- maybe they want to know they're wanted, I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] Who knows [SIGH]?
R:  I -- I don't understand --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's -- it's just -- it's ridiculous, and I know the strikes get aggravating, games get cancelled, and I know it's very frustrating for a lot of men who like sport.
L:  It's -- it's kind of sad when you look at, um, sports players, um, striking and we have men at war, and they have no choice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They can't strike.
R:  My husband can't strike, I mean ... they -- he had -- he had a plane catch on fire at the base out here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yesterday -- liquid oxygen blew up, and um, but he's like, "You know, anything could happen -- any of us at one time, whether we're at war or not".
L:  Right.
R:  "And we have no choice", and he says, you know, "And that's a chance we take, and look at these people, how they treat us" -- 'cause he has had some incidents where people don't support us around here -- being military families.
L:  Right, that's everywhere.
R:  And, I'm like,  "Yeah", he says, "That's --"
L:  People -- people treat military like, [SIGH] they take away jobs or -- or they --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, or whatever, but the case is they bring jobs.  My husband used to be in the navy --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- for eight years.
R:  Yeah, and they're not highly paid.
L:  Right, thank you -- very underpaid for the risks that they take.
R:  That they take, and they're gone, [several inaudible words] --
L:  And what risks do the men -- do people that are striking take?  Besides maybe getting --
R:  Oh, that they may -- that they maybe like, go [LAUGH] -- let's see they're still in their contract when they strike, and believe it or not, for the most part, they can strike in their contract.
L:  Really?
R:  And still get rehired -- yes, I've actually read up on this [SIGH] -- I've done a lot of research into this, 'cause I always thought, "Can they get fired?", 'cause I'm studying to be a paralegal and all -- can you get fired?  No.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, there really it's not a risk.
L:  So, they don't have anything to lose.
R:  They have nothing to lose, just everything to gain.
L:  [SIGH] Well, then you can't really blame 'em, if they're gonna -- if people are gonna sign contracts like that, where --
R:  I mean, if somebody's stupid enough to write a contract like that, I've gotta wonder.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  That's just -- I would put in there, "You strike, you're gone".
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And appreciate what you have, dang it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you agree to it, now stick with it.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH] But they don't -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they want more and more and more, just like -- I guess [MN] hu- -- that's human nature.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  You know, when you have it [SIGH], you use it, [MN] and you always want more, no matter how much you have.
R:  I mean, that's how -- that's how humans are, but these athletes, it's almost like you wonder -- are they human?  After a while.
L:  Right, they lose track of, ah, hu- humility and --
R:  Yeah, and values.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and -- 
L:  [MN]  That's for --
R:  -- and most of them don't have kids or anything [SIGH] --
L:  Well, a lot of 'em do come back to it.  I notice they -- when they find, like -- well, they spiral out of control and then they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- come back to what they know.
R:  Oh, like, um, what is it -- is it Micheal Jordan --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- charitable stuff, and all that.
L:  Well, and then he l- left his wife, but came back.
R:  Oh yeah, I mean, they get out of it, but then they come back to what really matters in life, and I admire that, I mean -- I mean, I think it's kind of craz- ...
