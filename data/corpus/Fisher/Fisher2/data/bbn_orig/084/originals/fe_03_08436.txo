L:  Prudence Laing.
R:  Hello.  This is -- ah, this is Ashi Shagreville[?] from, ah, University of Arizona, Tucson.  I'm a grad student here in College of Engineering and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm twenty two years old.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How about you?
L:  I'm twenty three years old.  Ah, I go to Temple. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I didn't get my Bachelors yet.  I'm working on it. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We -- ah, today's topic is, ah, what does the s- September eleventh and afterward --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has changed?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, that, ah --  most --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- important thing what I have seen is that, ah, I've seen that there's, ah, this tremendous planning of them.  I mean, the first thing was -- first thought what came to my mind was that, ah, "How -- how could -- how could they plan so well that they could have this September eleventh?"  Because, ah, America -- US has a -- such a great, you know -- this, ah, security and all the systems --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and this is so -- and how could they plan so well?  This is so, you know -- that it was difficult -- 'cause it's so diffi- -- what do you think?
L:  Okay.  The a- -- the question's asked how my life changed since September el- -- September --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- eleventh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, really, my life hasn't changed, you know, in a bi- -- in the first half, when it happened, yes.  But the only thing I see really, security has been beefed up.
R:  Yeah.  That's right.
L:  'Cause and -- most like -- now, we go places --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you need certain stuff to go into cer- certain -- in Federal Buildings.  I don't know how it was before 'cause I wasn't going to Federal Buildi- Buildings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you need IDs, you need an appointment, someone have to come and get you at the door or something.  Has --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hadn't noticed that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's -- that's about it.  I didn't see no other changes than that.
R:  Yeah.  That's right.  Because, ah, actually, this -- I di- -- I live in Arizona.  It's too far from where it took place.  So, maybe it didn't have that much of affect but -- yeah.  Emotionally, it did happen some affect.  I mean, ah, it was -- it was bad to see, you know, so many people die.
L:  Y- -- I mean, yeah.  That's part of -- yeah.  That was -- yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  That's a big- -- the main thing is that it, ah -- the farther -- farther you live from the place, ah, you wouldn't feel the [LAUGH] --
L:  I- --
R:  -- that emotional, right?
L:  True.  I -- I mean, I st- -- yeah.  I -- yeah.  That's, kinda, true.  You feel sorry for the people who died but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they didn't have no really impact on your life because, you know, you don't know none of them.
R:  But -- yeah.  But, ah, that even has, ah, had so many affects.  No -- I mean the -- this war, I think -- this war against Iraq, that was [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That was --
L:  Uh-huh.  I'm going to [inaudible] --
R:  And, ah, that attack on Afghanistan before this.  And everything is just because -- and then the economy.  I -- I think that -- that we have had some indirect effect of this because, ah, September eleventh had this, ah, so many effects on economy and that economy does affect us, right?
L:  Yeah.  True.
R:  Yeah.
L:  True.  Because you see a lotta -- a lotta place going outta business and people are getting laid off.  But you'll soon be see --
R:  Yeah.  That's right.
L:  You were see that before but, [NOISE] I guess, now, looking for a job, it is harder to find a job now.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how it was before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that's -- that's, kinda -- that's tr- true.
R:  Yeah.  So, mainly the economy.  Because now, I -- I see that people -- I -- I'm -- I'm at the University now so I see people graduating and I'll -- I c- -- I can see the fear [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in their eyes because they're not sure of the job and it was -- job -- this job of -- industry is so bad these days.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- that's true.  'Cause I -- I only got one more year of college and I can't find me a job right now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Unless at --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- McDonalds and I'm not working for no McDonalds.  So, that's true.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That part is true.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, because, ah -- before that it -- there was this, ah, slow down of the economy but -- and now, this is so bad.  I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, ah -- my friends, we have got around, ah, forty four or forty five in the class and 'til now, only four have got jobs and they're graduating this -- I mean, they already graduated.  So, then n- nobody showed off their [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.  Yes.
R:  -- future it's -- it's so bad.  I mean -- I mean, now they have to do something, which they really don't like to.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean --
L:  Not what they really want.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Honey, I don't --
R:  And -- yeah.  That's about it.
L:  Ah, where you say you're from?
R:  Ah, I'm from Tucson.
L:  Tucson?
R:  Yeah.  Arizona.  And how about you?
L:  Philly.
R:  Okay.  So, what do you do?
L:  I'm just a student.  That's it.  I can't get a job.  Just student.
R:  Oh.
L:  And yourself?
R:  Ah, I'm a student too.  I'm at the College of Engineering.  What do you study?
L:  [NOISE] Business management.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Oh, do you --
R:  Which college are you in?
L:  Huh?
R:  Which college are you in?  Which --
L:  Temple.  And you?
R:  Ah, I'm at University of Arizona.  Have you heard about it?
L:  Ah, University of Arizona?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, no.  But most likely, it's in Arizona so -- right? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No.  Okay.  And what's your major?
R:  Ah, it's, ah, Civil Engineering.
L:  S- --
R:  I [LAUGH] -- do you know about Civil Engineering? [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  Have you heard about it?  It is, ah, mostly about t- transportation.  You know, the -- the roads, traffic and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, ah, it's designing of light and d- -- you know, these days, everything is becoming automatic now because, ah, if you see the red lights at this -- on intersections --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything is becoming automatic.  Now, ah, it's not that th- the set time is fixed, it's, ah -- it -- there are some sensors on the road, which actually detect the vehicle and then it, ah, automatically sets the red light.  So, if they're no -- no cars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one approach, it will have a red time for those and, ah, the others --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- will have this green time so everything becomes faster. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Okay.  You say engineering?  That's what you said?
R:  Yeah.  Engineering.
L:  Okay.  No.  So, in case it i- -- 'cause you had an accent.  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  You --
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, are we supposed to -- we're supposed to wait for -- they supposed to stop us or ...?
R:  Ah, they will stop because, ah, we have to finish this eight minute.
L:  Okay.
R:  Something like that.
L:  [NOISE] All right.
R:  Ah --
L:  So, we still got to talk about the same topic?
R:  Y- --
L:  Or --
R:  Yeah.  Because the topic is this, ah, September eleven lo- -- ah --
L:  Eleventh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  When I -- when I started to do this, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talking I -- I was -- 'cause it made me wait for at least ten minutes.  I was -- I was just thinking because, ah, somebody referred to me and then I had referred this to so many other guys out there, I thought, maybe [LAUGH] I talk to somebody I [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.  No.  This is my fir- --
R:  -- I might talk to somebody I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Today's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Today the first one -- this -- today is my first time, that's why.
R:  Oh, yeah.  My first time too.
L:  But it's a -- okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so my cousin told me about this.  Ah, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I don't know much about the topic about September eleventh, truthfully.  Because --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not -- not a topic I'm really interested in talk about.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.  You might be more interested in some business topic, is it? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Are you finished stating[?] your opinion?  You got something else you want to say about September eleventh?
R:  Mm, I -- I don't really have an opinion about September eleventh but -- ah, that's a d- -- think I already had in my -- I just told you.  I mean, the planning part and then they can only affect.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's all I think.
L:  Well, do you notice -- I was, um, talking about the -- like, the airport systems, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Truthfully, 'cause, um, I travel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I just traveled to the -- I'm [inaudible] to Jamaica.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's where my family's from.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, like, they're searching your bags and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When you in Jamaica airport, they --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- search your bags.  They open your bags and search you.  But when once --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you come to the American system --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before it was just for -- you don't have to worry about none of that.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, everybody was trying to [inaudible] will probably see a pair[?] but I seen nothing was wrong with it 'cause I was already used to that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And everybody thought --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know -- did you hear the news?  Ah, well you -- well, it'll still be on no doubt, ah, um, where you're from, but in Philly, they were saying how the people now who- -- who search in their bags don't steal their money, taking their money and stuff out their, um, luggage and stuff.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  And mi- mind you, before September eleventh, they had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- regular people working until --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the, you know -- the government intervened and put their staff --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- or, you know, pick the people to work there.
R:  Oh.
L:  Now, look like they're picking criminals. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's, kinda, ironic.  So --
R:  Yeah.  That's right. [LAUGH] I mean, that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- life has been affected, like, this.  I mean, ah, the airports has so much of checking these d- -- [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  An- and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The air- airport do have the biggest effect since September eleventh, truthfully.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  The security has [LAUGH] -- has been so much.  That's right. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's one [LAUGH] good effect.  It has been, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yep.
R:  Okay.
L:  Are you doing this for the hospital?
R:  No.
L:  I mean -- oh, okay.  C- -- okay.
R:  I mean, I didn't get you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What was that?

R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  Oh, it's a --
L:  Okay.  Um, let's see what else ...?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess this is -- [LAUGH] kind of a difficult to talk to strangers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this way. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  What do you think? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Because, I mean, on the phone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's more difficult because if you -- if you see each other it's m- -- [LAUGH] maybe --
L:  M- --
R:  -- made a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- little easier. [LAUGH]
L:  It -- yeah.  I -- I -- or maybe the to- -- it depends on what kinda topic it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some topics you could blab about.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And some topics, I guess, you can't.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  So, how's your summer going?
L:  Hm?
R:  How's your summer going?  Summer?
L:  Um, it's doing fine so far.  I'm trying to get a job, like, I just was stressing.  But it's all right.
R:  So --
L:  I'm not doing nothing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And yourself?
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm j- -- I'm not getting a job.  That's the same.  I'm just hanging around. [LAUGH]

R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Me too.

L:  Can't wait 'til it's over. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's just [LAUGH] -- let's wait for the statement.

R:  A- --
L:  -- dorms, you know, on campus?
R:  Yeah.  I'm on campus.

L:  -- on healthcare management.
R:  Oh.  This is healthcare management?
L:  Yeah.  I wanna work in a hospital some day. [LAUGH]
R:  So, what do you do exactly?  I mean -- or do -- what is about?
L:  Um, tr- -- well, truthfully, I only have to write -- I had an introduction course --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a other course but [NOISE] it's not really -- I'm not trying to be smart, I haven't got that much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for healthcare management.  There's only three classes you take.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Everything else is just regular business courses.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like, regular [NOISE] everything else.
R:  Mhm.
