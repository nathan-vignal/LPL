R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm fine.

R:  Tatiana.
L:  Huh?
R:  Tatiana.
L:  Oh, my name's Kevin.
R:  Hi.
L:  All right.
R:  So, um, the topic is athletes going on strike?
L:  Well they're not, are they?  I don't know.  I'm in New York.
R:  Yes, so am I.
L:  You're in New York too?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I -- I -- I haven't heard anything about it.
R:  I didn't hear anything about it either.
L:  So wh- -- how do we talk about something that we don't anything about? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, but if they are, I don't see why because, I don't know, it depends on the reason and I don't know the reasons, so I don't know what to say about it.
L:  Exactly.  I was saying -- I was saying they're losing anyway.
R:  Yeah, I mean, like, depending on how good the record is right now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and with their salary, they shouldn't be going on strike for anything.
L:  Yeah, that's true too.
R:  Because they're wins -- they're wins, um losers right now.  Well, especially in baseball, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So I don't really know what the reason is.  I don't --
L:  [several inaudible words] they're losing a lot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's sad.
R:  It's just ridiculous right now.
L:  Yeah, the Yankees [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh yeah, I think the Yankees are going to make it to the series.
L:  Maybe [inaudible] huh?
R:  I think the Yanks are going to make it to the series.
L:  Oh yeah.  But do you like baseball?  Do you watch it?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ever go to Yankees Stadium?
R:  Yes.
L:  How do you like it?
R:  It's um, it's okay, I mean it's Yankee Stadium. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  When you're a Yankee fan, you know, it's good times but I mean, yeah, I kinda like the stadium in all, I just don't get -- I don't -- I don't even know where um, what sport they're talking about, of athletes going on strike.
L:  I ain't heard nothing about it.
R:  No.
L:  And I been reading -- well I don't read the sports, though I listen to it on the radio.
R:  Mhm, me too.
L:  And all I hear about is them losing, but I don't hear about them going on strike.
R:  Yeah, I haven't heard that either, and I listen to the radio, sports radio, every day, so 
L:  Yeah.  So who's your favorite team?
R:  My favorite for baseball is the Yanks.
L:  Huh?
R:  I'm a Yankee fan.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like basketball?
R:  Yeah, I'm a Laker fan.
L:  All right! [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  All right.
R:  And football, I'm a Giants fan.
L:  All right, that's good too.  You like hockey?
R:  Um, I used to, a long time ago --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but I stopped following it.
L:  Oh.  Who -- who was your team then?
R:  Um, a few years ago it was the Rangers.
L:  Yeah, they was good.  But now I like the Devils.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Yeah, the Devils are really good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, what other sport?  I don't follow soccer too much either.
L:  Nah.  Soccer [several inaudible words]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's -- that's what needs to go on strike.
R:  Basketball needs to go on strike?
L:  No, I said that's what need to, soccer.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  The tennis, the golf, they need to put [inaudible] on strike.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So tell me, um, wh- -- what -- what part of New York are you in?  I'm in the Bronx.
R:  I'm in Manhattan.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  On the upper east side.

R:  Yeah.  You go there a lot?
L:  I go past there a lot. [LAUGH] I ain't [inaudible] 'cause they -- 'cause -- 'cause they don't -- they don't know how to act sometimes.  They -- they be fighting and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  That's what's -- I don't know, that's what I like about Yankee fans though.
L:  What?  They fight?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're true fans.
L:  Yes, they -- they sure is. [several inaudible words] When I walked past there, um, which I, I walk there every day, I -- I walk past there, [several inaudible words]
R:  Huh?  Say that again?
L:  Even when I walked past there earlier --
R:  Do I go past there either?
L:  No, today, I went past Yankee Stadium.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I didn't see nothing to say that they're going on strike and that either.
R:  Yeah.  I haven't heard anything.  I don't think it's base- -- I don't even know.  I haven't heard anything about it.  I haven't heard, like, at all.  I don't even -- I don't know.
L:  You play -- you play sports?
R:  No, I run track.  That's about it.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, what kind of fun is that?
R:  What kind of what?
L:  Why -- why -- why do you do that?
R:  Like, um, what kind of events do I run?  Like, wh- -- what do we do?
L:  No, why -- why -- why -- why do you run track?
R:  I don't know.  That's what I'm good at.  I'm a good runner.
L:  Oh.  You ever get tired running?
R:  No.  Um, you learn how to breathe while you're running and shit, so --
L:  And then it becomes like walking, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'll run away, you chase me[?]
R:  [LAUGH] So it's -- I don't know, it's not that bad.  I like it.  I'm not good at basketball or anything, so 
L:  You don't play basketball?
R:  No, once in a blue I'll play for fun, but I'm not -- I'm garbage, so 
L:  Are you any good?
R:  Nah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You do the right thing, don't play.
R:  [LAUGH] You play?
L:  No.  I'm not really a sports fan.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Well, no.  I don't know, I'm the other things, like, I like cooking and stuff like that.  I -- I more -- I like to learn, ah, stuff, I like computers and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I ain't got time to be trying to learn that and then run around trying to run around things[?]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially if it's hot out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hot -- it's hot out there today.
R:  Yeah, I haven't run in a long time because this heat is ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, it's hot.  You graduated from school?
R:  Um, not yet.
L:  Not yet.  What year are you?
R:  I'm going into eleven.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You going to go to college?
R:  Huh?
L:  Going to college?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  But yeah, so I don't know what this is all about 'cause --
L:  That makes two of us.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I guess we oughta use the time.
R:  Yep.  I don't know, so.  All I know is that um, I haven't really heard about anything.  The last time I heard about a strike was -- I can't even think.  Um, like, a few months ago, maybe, where there was going to be a possible basketball strike, was it?
L:  The last time I heard about it was a year -- a year ago.
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  When Steinbruner was -- what do you think about that guy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I ain't hear nothing else.  Walking past the stadium, I didn't see no -- they usually have a sign or something up there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I walked past there today, I didn't see no sign.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh well.  I just -- I don't think there's -- I mean, I guess a lot depends on the reason, but as far as I'm concerned their -- their playing isn't -- although baseball wise --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- the athletes aren't doing well enough to be going strike, especially baseball and their salaries.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  And then same with basketball.  But I don't know.  Have you been following like, LeBron James and all those cats?
L:  The guy that -- the guy [inaudible]
R:  No, that's Kobe.
L:  That -- that's Kobe, yeah.
R:  Yeah, no, but LeBron, he just came from ah, college, from high school actually --
L:  Oh.
R:  He was like the top high school basketball player.  He just went to the Cavaliers.
L:  Now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You like the Cavaliers?
R:  N- --
L:  I've never seen them play, really.  But I hear -- I -- I -- I heard a lot about them.
R:  Yeah, no, um, I'm not a big fan of them but they're a pretty good team, I guess.  I'm surprised he went there but --
L:  They didn't -- they didn't -- what was [several inaudible words]
R:  Huh?
L:  What, they drafted him?
R:  Draft, yeah.
L:  Oh.  He ain't have much choice.
R:  Yeah.  But there's a lot of drama with him.
L:  You ever go to the Garden and see a game?
R:  Huh?
L:  You ever go to Madison Square Garden and see a game?
R:  Um, I've been to the Madison Square, ah, Square Garden for concerts and stuff, but for games, I only went for my high school game.
L:  Your high school game?
R:  Yeah, 'cause they were in the final four, so --
L:  They win?
R:  Nah.
L:  Agh.
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  How did I know that?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But yeah, that's the only time I've been there for like, a game.  And I've never been to a hockey game so, nah.
L:  No, me neither.  'Cause they be knocking out there -- they be coming all out of there -- small guys --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kicking people in the head and stuff.
R:  Yeah, so I don't know.  I haven't really been to one of those games either.
L:  What -- what else do you do?
R:  Like what?
L:  Ah, for fun, you know, for recreation.
R:  Um, running is basically it.
L:  How long do you usually run for?
R:  Six years.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You've been running a long time?  Like, how many miles a day?
R:  Oh, I do like, the hundred meter races and the four hundred meter races.  I've never really -- I don't like doing a mile but, for like, for ru- -- um, practice and stuff, I'll run a mile.
L:  Ever ran around Central Park?
R:  Yeah, that's where we practice sometimes.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow, that's a big park.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do like cross country type
