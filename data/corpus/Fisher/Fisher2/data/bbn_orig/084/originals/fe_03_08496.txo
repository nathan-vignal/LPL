R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name's Kristen.
R:  Hi Kristen, I'm Miriam [LIPSMACK].
L:  Hi Miriam.
R:  I'm from New Jersey.
L:  I am from, ah, Portland, Oregon.
R:  Oh, well, that's cross country.
L:  [LAUGH] Just about.
R:  Okay, so we're talking about these wonderful athletes.
L:  [SIGH] We are.
R:  And ...
L:  Are we going to agree?
R:  Well, I think that they're way overrated -- 
L:  [SIGH] So do I.
R:  I think [inaudible] is getting a hundred and eighty million for a contract and he's not even playing, I think they all stink -- that's my opinion.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, we're pretty much going to agree here, so I'm not sure if we can maintain ten minutes of conversation of agreement, but --
R:  Yeah, that's true --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, I just think that they're overpaid and I think that [NOISE] --
L:  Very overpaid.
R:  -- they're in it just for the money, they're not in it for any other reason.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I'm seventy four, so, I remember when sports was such a wonderful thing, you know, they was in it for the honor [NOISE] and the glory and -- ah, just because it was a good game, now, [MN] you know, it's just awful -- they -- fame and not the game, anymore, but --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- everyone is the money, money, money, money [NOISE].
L:  Well, and, I think part of it for me, I mean, I like sports -- not that --
R:  [inaudible] I hear you.
L:  -- I was ever that great, but I enjoyed --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- doing it -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- doing them as a child --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, and the emphasis was always on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the fun.
R:  That's right, it was fun [NOISE] --
L:  But --
R:  -- but, you see now even with the Little League today, the parents are fighting, everybody wants to win, win, win and I think they really -- because these guys make so much money, I don't think the kids really relate to this, ah, if they're not famous and they don't get a little of that publicity and all that [MN] -- it's just not worth it anymore.
L:  [SIGH] Well, and, I mean, I'm [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kids pick up on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --   so much --
R:  They do.
L:  -- I mean, they pick up on what's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on what's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on what's important, or what at least is presen- presented --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as being important, and certainly I don't think that most parents do this, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [inaudible] my nephew is just starting out, he's um, five --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and just starting out with, ah -- he's been doing T ball, and he's been doing baseball and my parent -- my brother and his wife are great, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- boy, some of the parents that are involved --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you'd think this was, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the end of the world if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- their child doesn't get played, or if there isn't a win, or the idea of like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everyone's doing their best, and, you know, everyone's having fun, and I feel really sorry for these kids that have these --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- parents that are so focussed on -- winning's what's important to --
R:  You know, nobody wins, everybody loses because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the kids are just not learning, you know, how to have fun [NOISE] --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it's not fun anymore, and you know what, we -- I don't go -- I hate baseball, I hate all of it, but my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, my husband goes with my son in law, and when they go to see a game, you know, you're paying all this big money for a hotdog, a hamburger, I mean, you know, it reflects on everybody, so it takes the joy out of all this fun that years ago they used to go to the ball game, and, you know, you could take the kids and you could afford it and [several inaudible words] afford to. 
L:  It could be a family thing that you could go and have fun, and -- and I agree, you don't really see -- I mean [MN], and again, I enjoy, I don't know -- baseball, I find kind of, actually, boring --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- I know that's kind of sacrilegious to say that --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- but -- but like, basketball -- I love to watch basketball --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- or soccer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or things, but, you're right, the price is so prohibitive, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, how can you do that?  How can --
R:  You can't -- they take the joy out of everything, because you can't afford it anymore [NOISE] -- and all -- they're all out just for the money, I have no respect for most people -- not in the last year -- and look at that one that hit that girl with the baseball bat the other day.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  What -- what -- [MN] what's that all about?
L:  I don't know, um, an over inflated sense of ego?
R:  And I'm sure he'll get away with it, although I hope she sues the pants off him, but I mean, where does he come off?
L:  Well, but even if she does, he probably still thinks, "Oh, I've got the money", or what, you know.
R:  So, I have the right.
L:  Or, whatever, so ...
R:  So, do you have children?  [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, no.
R:  That play sports?  Okay.
L:  No, I don't.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Do you? 
R:  Ah, well, I'm seventy four, mine are way past that --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- been there, done that, don't wanna do that any more [LAUGH].
L:  I have my niece and my nephew --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, I think another thing for me, um, just kind of considering the whole issue of the salary --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that are played by many professional sports athletes is, that in comparison to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- other professions, I think that the amount of money is ludicrous, and my connection [several inaudible words] that I'm a teacher --
R:  Oh, okay, that's a very -- 
L:  -- so, ah ...
R:  -- an honorable trade.
L:  I'm -- I'm gonna go out and say, I think teachers are paid way below --
R:  And you should be paid millions of dollars, because what you do is important.
L:  [SIGH] Wouldn't it be an odd world if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if that kind of money was given to people who were involved in the education of children?  I don't know [SIGH].
R:  But, man, then they've got the nerve to strike, I mean, that's what really ticks me off -- they've got the nerve to strike.
L:  I know, it's like what you doing?  You're looking for more money?
R:  Well, they're making millions and millions and millions, and they're never satisfied, they're so greedy -- really greedy.
L:  [SIGH] And yet there's -- rewarded for being greedy, or rewarded for being flamboyant, or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I think the other thing I think about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is just that whole sense of, like, for example in the world of basketball --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with these high school kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them being drafted into professional sports and --
R:  Into college just because they play a good game of basketball.  [NOISE] 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  That's a thought. [NOISE]
L:  Or, you know, whatever the case may be in --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, if I was, you know, a teenager --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, that would certainly be attractive, the amount of -- again, the amount of money I could make, the amount of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- publicity, and fame that could go with that, I mean, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] hello, skipping college?  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, there was a -- an article in the paper not so long ago about this kid that was drafted right out of school and signed to this multi million contract -- hasn't even played yet for this team -- 
L:  [SIGH] And how can you --
R:  -- what does he have to look forward to?
L:  I don't know, well, making more money and I guess, having his whole identity [MN] wrapped around how much money he can make for the team.
R:  Playing basketball [NOISE].
L:  I know, but basketball doesn't last forever.
R:  No.
L:  Or, I mean, any sport.
R:  But, I guess if you make that kind, it doesn't have to last forever, right?  If you're careful with it.
L:  Well, except that he probably won't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when he's going to learn about how to manage --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, his money, or about his set of -- of, I don't know, prospective --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- responsibility to, [SIGH] you know, sharing with the community?  I mean, I think a lot of them actually burn through the money pretty fast, which is why they feel comp- -- like, justified, like, okay, I use my money all the time, I'm making millions of dollars, but I need more to maintain the style of living I'm -- I'm accustomed to.
R:  Which isn't such a great style.
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know ...
R:  Well, you know, there's really -- there's so much negative news about athletes -- they really paint a really dreary picture for kids to be looking up to, and want to copy and be like them, and, you know -- they -- some of them, they drink, they do drugs, they beat women, they -- [MN] it really -- it's a sad state.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not -- not all them, let's not say all of them.
L:  Not all, but -- but, again part of --
R:  A lot of -- a big amount of 'em.
L:  -- this is, the -- kind of the way the media focuses again, the media focuses on those extremes --
R:  Well --
L:  -- rewards those extremes with exposure and --
R:  J Lo every night --
L:  -- talking about it --
R:  -- makes a joke about some of them on -- on these teams --
L:  You know, and it's --
R:  -- and, ah, you know, it's not very flattering.
L:  No, it's not, and yet there are s- -- you know, I mean, there are people who [SIGH], um, you know, for example Echero[?] with, um, the Mariners, there are many, many stories about -- that he is very community minded and oriented and is very much involved in investing in the community, and [SIGH] you know, that's great, you know, more power to him -- that's a wonderful thing and I guess I'd, you know, feel a little bit better if -- if that was part of the subculture, but it's not.
R:  But, you know, they don't talk about him much, right?
L:  It's the exception to the rule.
R:  Mhm --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- and nobody knows about him -- nobody hears about that part of him.
L:  Not -- not as much, and when it does, it's like, "Wow, isn't this amazing", it's like wow.
R:  It is, yeah, that is nice.
L:  I mean, yeah, it's nice, but wouldn't it be nicer if --
R:  It's such a small part of it, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] New York because, every time I see them on TV [NOISE] complaining about this, that and the other thing, and that's another thing -- this new basketball player wants the coach to be fired because he doesn't like him, well, duh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- is he in that position that he's going to tell them to fire the coach, I mean, what's -- what's that all about?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Power.
R:  They just -- they have such an ego.
L:  Ah, yeah, actually I think a lot of it is ego, and -- and there's -- it's tough for them just to have a sense of perspective.  They're being, you know, again, they're being rewarded for maintaining the kind of personality that they have and for -- and, the -- the long term is --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  -- is when that ha- -- when that passes, and it will -- where's their sense of identity then?  Their sense of identity is in, you know, "I was this huge famous person who made this amount of money", and when that passes [MN], like, where are they?
R:  Suing some person with a lot of money [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, except that I'm really convinced --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- that I don't think they hold onto the money -- I think they waste it.  Many of them --
R:  I don't think they're -- some of them are not even educated enough to know what to do with that money, you know, it's a shame -- they go through it -- you're right, they go through it, they blow it -- spend it on [inaudible] cars and drugs, and [inaudible] and blah, blah, blah, and that's a shame --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- too, if they put it to some use, at least if they're gonna if they're gonna get a hundred and eighty million -- give some of it away to something decent --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- change your image at least.
L:  Exactly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, you know, share it -- you know --
R:  Yeah, let's share the wealth.
L:  -- it's like you've been blessed, that's a great thing, you know.
R:  I'm for that [MN].
L:  You've been blessed with talent, well, fine, go ahead and use your talent and have fun, but, you know, share the good stuff that comes to you.
R:  And set a nice example for the kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I feel sorry for the kids that didn't have Joe DiMaggio, didn't have all those [SIGH], you know, wonderful players that you -- they can look up to and be heros -- there aren't any of those today.
L:  Not too many.
R:  And I hope the kids don't make heros out of these guys, because that would be a terrible thing in itself.
L:  Again, there are a few, but --
R:  There are a few.
L:  -- but -- but again, [MN] I think the whole sense of [SIGH] the -- the things that go around the sport have become more important than, may ...
