L:  Joel.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name is Mary.  How are you, Joel?
L:  Hi, Mary, how's it going?
R:  I'm doing pretty good, how 'bout yourself?
L:  I'm all right.
R:  Good.
L:  Is this the first time you're doing this?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Oh --
R:  How'd you know?
L:  Uh, no, I'm just asking because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for me the third time, I did it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- twice yesterday.
R:  Oh, so you can do it more than once?
L:  Yeah, up to three times, I believe.
R:  I see.  Okay.
L:  Well, for the men, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, where do you live?
R:  I live in, uh, Metropolitan Boston.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  I live in New York City.
R:  In New York City, Big --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Apple.
L:  So, uh --
R:  So, you were at the site?
L:  I'm at the site, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- let me start by asking how the events changed, uh, your habits, uh, in Boston?  What have you -- what are you doing differently now that you didn't do prior to nine eleven?
R:  Not a thing.
L:  Not a thing.
R:  Not a thing.
L:  Okay.
R:  How 'bo- how bout yourself?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, um, it depends what you mean by not a thing, as -- as in not a thing as in to trying to change your lifestyle to basically show that, you know, this did not affect me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's one way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to look at it and there -- but there are other things that I also do, uh, just in case --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- first of all I tried to get a list of contacts from all my friends and relatives that are in New York City --
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  -- um, just in case something happens, I know how to get in touch with everyone, especially with regards to my kids as I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I don't live with my children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, [SIGH] I'm more aware of my surroundings in a way, it's not that I'm paranoid and some people are and I -- that's understandable, but, um, I -- I kinda make it a point to make sure that I know where I am and what to do if something happens and I -- I have, like, case scenarios in my mind.
R:  So -- so you have, um, a -- sort of, changed your method of operations?
L:  Uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Wha- what you pay attention and --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- your --
L:  -- yeah --
R:  -- awareness of things and, I haven't done any of that, the only thing that I do differently, if anything, is arrive at airports earlier than I'm supposed to and that's -- or, earlier than I used to and that's only because I'm required to do so, otherwise I'd probably be getting out of the car and running for my flight.
L:  Okay.
R:  But --
L:  It -- you know, it's funny because [COUGH] about a w- week and a half after this whole thing happened, nine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- eleven, I went to Boston --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because my ex has family there and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- uh, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Site of departure. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, we like, "Oh, let's just get out of the city to --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- you know, relax". [MN]
R:  A- and you went to Boston --
L:  We --
R:  -- where the planes took --
L:  E-
R:  -- off?
L:  -- where the planes took off.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wha- the planes didn't impact in Boston, they landed -- they came here, I mean --
R:  [SIGH] --
L:  -- it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was more of a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a point they wanted to make and i- it seemed like a -- a ci- a city like New York where, you know, it's considered to be kind of an international metropolis --
R:  Mhm.  Sure.
L:  -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a strong financial, uh, urban [COUGH] uh, area, you know, "This is the best place if we want to have an impact and make a point", not so much Boston.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  However, however we -- I felt like when I went to Boston that it was the -- the security was there but it was very, it was much more relaxed.
R:  Um, I think, uh, most of the news updates in -- at least in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this area say that we're still somewhat relaxed, even though, um, the perpetrators of the crimes, um, had, uh, relatively no difficulty boarding from here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, getting to their points of destination, um, you know, there was -- there was some stuff that was changed, um, some heads rolled, um, from the people that were in charge of security and in charge of, um, in charge of the airport --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- otherwise I think it's pretty much the same, you know, you see some presence of, um, you see some more guns out there, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some more people are in security patrols and -- and I think security is -- is, um, a little bit more pronounced now for curbside, uh, boarding and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but otherwise I think it's -- it's pretty much the same as it -- it was, um, quite shocking as a Bostonian to learn that, um, that, um, yeah, one could just get on a plane and hijack it at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at, uh, at will --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and they could do it from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, from my home town. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what ca- what can you do?  It's like you -- everybody goes on the assumption that the whole world is civilized until something like that happens --
R:  I'm not sure --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- any part of the world is civilized --
L:  [MN] Ye-
R:  -- I -- that's --
L:  -- yeah --
R:  -- an assumption --
L:  -- that's --
R:  -- that I --
L:  -- subjective --
R:  -- don't --
L:  -- also. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't -- I don't even make that assumption, I assume that most of the world is uncivilized --
L:  That is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- true, that is true, even here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at home, there is --
R:  Ye-
L:  -- many --
R:  Well --
L:  -- things that are uncivilized.
R:  Yeah, yeah, for the most part I think the world is uncivilized, I think we go into the pretense that we're civilized, but I think it's -- it's a pretentious word to use in that, uh, most of us aren't --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- civilized.
L:  -- that's true.
R:  Whatever that means.
L:  Do you -- do you work, or --
R:  I am, uh, self employed, I'm a church organist.
L:  Okay, so are there measures particularly at your church that --
R:  No.
L:  -- uh, they've taken?  No.
R:  No, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  Not a thing.
L:  We- well for me it's a little bit different, I'll tell you why, because number one I work for the UN, I work for Unicef to be more precise --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they've made it a point, we've realized that we didn't really have, like, uh -- we have all these emerges -- emergency measures for our field officers around the world --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- except, uh, in the US and in Europe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause we never assumed that something w- like that would happen.  So --
R:  Interesting.
L:  --they made --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they made it a point to, like, um, kind of beef us up and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and not provide us training but more information on [COUGH] what to do in case there is, um, uh, another attack of some sort --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So they've given us guidelines.
R:  Do you think that it -- that it has, um, somewhat gotten to a, I don't know, almost a -- a ridiculous level of security now?  When the Fourth of July approached, everything was -- was all beefed up and when there's a -- you know, when there's, um, uh, a particular football game, everything is all beefed up and at the World Series all the intense security and -- and -- and things, uh, you know, just [MN] general things like that, I th- I think to myself, "This is -- this has just gone way overboard for security" --
L:  Um --
R:  -- it's like everything -- everything is at risk and I look at the small, little, dinky town that I'm in and -- and they're talking about, "What are we going to do if we're hit?"  And I'm saying, "What are we going to do if we're hit?  Nobody even knows we're here, Never --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- mind we're hit".
L:  Um --
R:  You know?
L:  -- well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you see, that's the thing and s- I think s- terrorists are playing a very good psychological game with us, uh, right now security is beefed up so much in New -- well, not so much now, but it -- there's such an emphasis on security that, if I were them, quite frankly I wouldn't, uh, target New York anymore.  Number one, I would target an area where they least expect it, I'm not saying Boston is one of these areas, but since, you know --
R:  Yeah, probably --
L:  -- people are --
R:  -- is. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and number two, because you want now -- now that you've made your s- political statement, now, if you want to strike fear into hearts of American citizens, then you gotta hit them when they -- they expect it the least, 'cause --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you want to have an impact on the citizens themselves, not just on the economy and everything else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and number two, why the hell would they do that on a major holiday when they know that that's when security is at its highest?  You know, um, they've -- they've, uh, waited all this time before they struck on September eleventh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and they're going to catch us when we're off guard again, so --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I think --
L:  -- that [MN] --
R:  -- yeah, I -- I'm -- I'm not sure I agree with that, I think that -- that, um, it's in -- in one way with -- without sounding offensive, I hope, it's -- it's trying to make sense out of nonsense and I don't think that you can, you know, tha- wi- with a sort of a nonsensical act and -- and, um, you know, we try to make it -- we try to make sense out of when this will happen again and -- and I don't think that you can, September eleventh, it was a -- it was a nonsense date, it -- it meant nothing to anybody other than to some people who were on a plane who were -- who were planning to make some other people miserable.
L:  Well, that's the --
R:  So --
L:  -- whole, that's the whole thing, but they -- there is method behind their madness and just to -- to go back to what I was saying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- it's exactly [MN] is -- is just what I meant, they're not going to necessarily plan it around a major event --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- it's best when -- [MN] it's not best, really --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's a really bad thing, but, for them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to catch us when --
R:  When --
L:  -- there is not --
R:  -- you're off guard.
L:  -- a sig- significant gate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- date or --
R:  When --
L:  -- weren't --
R:  -- you're off guard.
L:  -- exactly.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, I hope it doesn't happen, everybody's much more aware here in New York, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm -- and I'm saddened at the other repercussions we've had, especially in the Arabic, uh, community --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Arab community --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some people are being targeted for -- for no reason --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- as far as hate crimes are concerned.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- well, hate crimes are hate crimes --
L:  Exactly --
R:  -- regardless.
L:  -- period.
R:  -- re, uh, period.  Exactly, regardless and -- and they're all -- they're all atrocities, regardless --
L:  So --
R:  -- of -- of who it's against or who it's for, or what the reason is or, you know, it's all -- it's all hate and -- and who needs it?  We --
L:  W-
R:  -- who --
L:  Well, you know, and that's -- that's the --
R:  -- we go back to --
L:  -- reason why we're --
R:  -- we go back to --
L:  -- here today.
R:  -- our civilized community then, to our civilized world, it's --
L:  I know.
R:  -- not very.
L:  It's -- it's a problem that all countries have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to deal with and it's not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just a -- a problem in the Middle East but it's a problem here in -- in the States, in North America, where we're still dealing with, uh, [MN] hatred, um, where people are misusing -- still misusing religion to, um, get their points across in a very negative --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- way.
R:  Oh, and it's sort of misuse everything, uh, religion, business --
L:  Kinda ticks --
R:  -- automo-
L:  -- me off. [LAUGH]
R:  -- automobiles, um --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, federal funds, government, uh, there's -- that's -- that's why I still come back to the -- it -- it being so non civilized, we -- we ...
