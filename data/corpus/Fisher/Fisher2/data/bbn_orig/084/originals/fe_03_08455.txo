L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Susan.
L:  Oh, uh, Moe. [NOISE]
R:  Wh- and what area are you from, Moe?
L:  Uh, New York City.
R:  Okay, I'm from Baltimore but right now I'm down in New Orleans staying with my sister.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Visiting her family.
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about September eleventh and how it may have changed your life.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, do you have anything to -- to start with.  I have something if you want.
R:  Well, um, my anniversary was on September eleventh so that was --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- uh, that was kind of, uh, draining.  And my husband's a police lieutenant so I didn't even see him that day.  The day it happened.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think it's, you know, the old slaying -- saying, "Stop and smell the roses" I try and do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I try and remember how people were acting immediately afterwards, so full of concern for people and try and live that way.  Unfortunately, I think our country's gone back to nor- you know, back to pre September eleventh.  I don't think that too many people learn the lessons from it or try and put it in their life.  And I know I'm guilty of that too.
L:  Mm.
R:  How are you?
L:  Oh, well it ma- -- I did some things that -- it -- it -- it -- it, uh, it's spurred me to change a couple of things.  Uh, one thing was I'd been planning to go back to school for many years and working on it and I finally did it.  After that I really started working on my application seriously.  And --
R:  Well, good.  Were you in New York that day?
L:  -- and I did go.  I was in New York that day.
R:  So, you really were too close to it.
L:  I was very close.  Um, I mean, I -- I don't live in that area but I do live in Manhattan.  Uh, I was -- the other thing that was interesting was that I was just on my way to my -- to my therapist, to my psychotherapist --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, she didn't know about it.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I had to tell her because she might have some relatives there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that was a very strange experience.  I don't know if it changed anything, it might have changed our relationship, not in a bad way but -- but it was very strange because, uh, you know, ususally that -- th- there's some objectivity in those -- in those, uh, in those relationships, you try to keep them somewhat objective.
R:  Right.
L:  And here you have, like, a major, uh, catastrophe happening and ...  In terms of politics, I think that's what you're talking about, politics?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Or are we talking more about personal changes --
R:  Personal changes.
L:  -- in people's lives.  Well, I -- I've seen changes.  Some of my friends are --
R:  Well, I think -- and -- and New York is different from any place else.  I think New York and Washington and Pennsylvania because they were directly affected you would see somewhere we wouldn't.
L:  That could be.  I have a friend who left immediately after that.  He was so anno- upset about the whole thing and he went back to Cincinnati and he did the same thing, he finished his college degree.  And he came -- and then he just came back a couple of weeks ago.  So, that was interesting and that was his response, he was like, uh, just really upset.  He used to work in that building.
R:  [MN] Oh boy.
L:  And, uh, so for him it was troubling.  You know, a couple of years ago -- a couple of years before that he had worked in that building.  Uh --
R:  But still that -- it is awfully close to home.
L:  Yeah, no I've been in that building, I used to go to New Jersey and go through it on the Path train.  But, um, the other thing -- what else is there?  I don't know, it's hard to say, um, how has it changed my life?  I can tell you what I did immediately after that, uh, which is a strange response probably.  Just to escape the whole thing I -- oh, oh, another thing -- well, there was a big chang- -- well, you might be right about New York but there was a big change -- well, I don't know, I wonder if this was so in your city, uh, there were people lighting candles on the corner of the street.
R:  No, I didn't see that in Baltimore, but then again it's -- we weren't directly affected.
L:  Well, Baltimore's very near Washington.
R:  True, but, um, you know, it's still an hour away and I think it -- it's different, if you're in a different city, I think.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, it -- it's not quite as close to home.
L:  I see.  Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?  That it's not quite as close to home, although you're really in the same -- it really is.
R:  Yeah, I think that, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- fifty miles away --
L:  The affect, I mean --
R:  -- can make a big difference, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and pl- -- Washington treats Baltimore, like, you know, um, second class and I think Baltimore sort of prides itself on that so we're -- you know, we -- we are not inferior to Washington but we're not Washington.
L:  No, I mean, Baltimore's a really cool city actually.  I've only spent a little time there but I've heard -- I -- I know that it's a very well run organized, well organized city --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's a relatively new, uh, to -- I think it's a relatively new planning -- it's a relatively new city.  What year -- do you know when Baltimore was founded?
R:  Well, there are parts of Baltimore that were, um, found in seventeen ninety seven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, one thing that's interesting the mayor is really -- well, the mayor and the [NOISE] previous police commissioner were very involved in, um, in defence after September eleven, they really are putting the emphasis on guarding against anything similar so it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's very important to Baltimore to try and plant so if something like that were to -- well, to try and prevent anything like that ever happening in Baltimore.  But that if something did they would -- the resources would be there to try and handle it as well as poss- possible with as few lives as possible lost.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  You know, now that I think about it -- I'm sorry, go on.
R:  So, you know, just in -- in Baltimore we still are reminded about it because of the emphasis on prevention and communication, things like that.
L:  The city, but how do you feel?
R:  Well --
L:  See, you're talking in general terms but --
R:  True --
L:  -- how do you feel about nine eleven?  I think that's the question.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I can talk about -- I can tell you a couple more things that I think affected me trying to think of before.  And it may be --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- different in New York, it may be more personal.  Um, I -- I, uh -- uh, for several months or numerous months after that I, uh, every loud noise that I heard, every backfire of a car --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or every jump of a truck, and you hear that all the time in New York, or every loud door slam --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'd jump.  At every single one.
R:  Ooh.
L:  And for, uh, uh, maybe even -- even now just a little but until pretty recently every siren was a big deal, you know, I looked at every siren.
R:  Yeah, that's gotta --
L:  And --
R:  -- be rough.
L:  Yeah, well that -- I think I'm -- I think lots and lots of people felt that way.
R:  Well, and that's what -- I've been --
L:  I think that's like really --
R:  -- reading articles and they say that --
L:  -- 'cause you're waiting for the next thing to happen.
R:  Yeah, and they say that's a real problem for New Yorkers, the post traumatic stress.
L:  Well, I don't know it's, uh -- it may be but, uh, but people are upset, yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, the other thing that I could say about it, uh, immediately after nine eleven I went to draw -- I didn't have lots of money in the bank but I went to take out as much as I could get 'cause I was scared, I thought I might need cash or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I --
R:  Well, yeah, nobody knew.
L:  And I wasn't the only one.  The bank line around -- the line around the bank to the ATM was, uh, all the way around the corner and, uh, by the time I got there some of the machines were empty.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that gives you a sense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And people were shopping -- people were going to the supermarket and people were -- now, I live in -- in Manhattan on the airport side, the streets which are usually full of cars --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- were full of people, there weren't a lot of cars at all.
R:  [MN]
L:  They were full of people walking.  And the following -- actually here's a little story.  A couple of days later walking down the street and I was just listening to, uh, I don't know, I think something about Afghanistan and Osama Bin Laden --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I was waiting for a bus and I got -- and a car backed into me, now I didn't get hurt but I had a -- a laptop in my backpack and I went over to this fellow to stop and give me his insurance and he just drove off.  And then I went to, uh -- this is a couple of day later and, you know, it -- it just was weird.  And, uh, uh, I went to call the police because that's basically, although I wasn't hurt it is really a hit and run.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's required to give me his information.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, I called them and I felt a little guilty about it 'cause I figured they were real busy these days.  But I did call and asked them if they felt they should come and they did.  Now, as I was on the phone I heard this tremendous -- no, no, no, no, what happened was -- oh yeah, so -- so the woman said, "Okay, where are you?" and they sent these fire engines which I didn't want --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] and I'm standing there and suddenly these giant fire engines show up and, uh, the -- I -- the fellow asks me where the emergency is and I tell him there's no emergency so I had to tell him what happened and as I'm talking to him I hear this tremendous boom and I see the -- uh, a, um, a pothole cover -- not a pothole cover a, uh, manhole cover --
R:  Manhole cover.
L:  -- fly up into the air and a tremendous amount of smoke come out.
R:  Oh no.
L:  And so, I think, everyone was kinda shocked.  Like people are looking at the -- at the fire engine 'cause that was troubling as it is and then they see this tremendous boom, you know, this fire [LAUGH] -- this thing in the middle of the street, it almost hit a car and, uh, um, and [LIPSMACK] the fire- fireman said, uh, "Take cover, take cover" so I ran into the supermarket.  And then when I came out, uh, they said, "Oh, it's nothing, it happens all the time".
R:  Oh gee.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I guess they thought something else was gonna happen.
L:  They were afraid, I guess they were afraid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know how these things, you know, and I was thinking, like, who knows maybe the bombed the sewers, I don't know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know why they would but, I guess, uh, who knows, they could do anything.
R:  Well, who would know why they would crash a plane into a building either.
L:  Yeah, it's a strange thing.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, that -- yeah, so those are some things that happened to me.  But, I don't know if that's exactly changed my life but they were interesting.
R:  Well, it changed your life for awhi- ...
