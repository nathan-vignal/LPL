L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Bob.
L:  Hi, my name is Kim.  Ah --
R:  Kim?
L:  Yes.  Kim, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is kind of a hard subject for me because I don't pay a lot of attention to sports.
R:  Well you know they get paid a lot, don't you?
L:  Ah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Do you think they deserve it?
L:  You know, for -- for having fun and playing a game, not really.  But you know, if that's what they're going to get paid for, you know, people buying the tickets, you know --
R:  Watching television.
L:  -- yeah, you know, watching the television, I guess get what they can.  Now striking, I don't know anything about that going on right now.
R:  There's nothing going on right now, but um, baseball has had some strikes and -- they got higher salaries for it.
L:  See, I've known that in the past that they -- I don't think striking's right.  They get paid enough the way it is.
R:  Well I -- they're supposed to be professionals, aren't they?
L:  Yeah, that's a good point. [LAUGH] Yeah.  There's no reason to strike, you know, they're getting paid an ungodly amount anyway.
R:  Right.  I don't think they would strike again.
L:  If they don't like it, go somewhere else then.
R:  Right.
L:  That's crazy.  It's -- have you done this study thing before?
R:  I did -- I've done it before, once or twice.
L:  Okay, this is my second call I've done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And did you get paid, or ?
R:  I got paid, yeah.
L:  You did.  Okay.  I'm just curious [LAUGH] about it.  This is only the second call I've done, so 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I didn't know much about it.
R:  What about the um --
L:  Yeah, but like I said, I -- I don't pay much attention to sports, I'm not a big sport person and, you know, they play, great.  I watch maybe the local football team when they play, but that's about it.
R:  What team is that?
L:  Ah, Nebraska.
R:  Oh yeah, Nebraska.
L:  The Corn Huskers, yeah.
R:  Yeah, the Corn Huskers.  They had a good coach for a long time and then they lost, he retired.
L:  I know.
R:  And they've sort of gone downhill now.
L:  Oh gosh, you know --
R:  What was his name?
L:  Um, let me see.  We had Osborne and now we have --
R:  Osborne, yeah.
L:  -- So- -- Solich.  Ah, Solich.
R:  Yeah.  O- -- Osborne was your coach.
L:  Yeah, he was good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now this last --
R:  Most of those college teams depend on their coach.  Basketball and football, all that.  It depends on the coach.
L:  And I didn't watch much last year because they didn't worth anything. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  It was pretty sad.
R:  Right.
L:  So you keep up on the sports then?
R:  Well --
L:  Pretty much, or ?
R:  -- I keep track of local teams, and ah, basketball, I still follow that, the college basketball, you know, I follow um, college football and base- -- major league baseball.
L:  I'm not even sure what they get paid.  I know it's a lot.  But I -- I don't know what their salaries are.  The professionals.
R:  Well, one player makes twenty five million a year to play for ah, Texas.  Baseball player, R- -- Arod Rodriguez.
L:  How much does he make?
R:  Twenty five million salary a year.
L:  That's crazy.
R:  Plus en- -- he makes endorsements besides.
L:  Jeeze.  I don't know, he better --
R:  He's got a contract for eight years, I think.
L:  Oh well, he bet- --
R:  Nine years or something.
L:  Oh, that's crazy.  That -- that --
R:  I'm not a Texas -- I -- I wouldn't mind if -- if I were a Texans fan I wouldn't mind if Texas were in the running for the division championship or the World Series or the pennant or something like that, but they're not.
L:  That's --
R:  That's like bringing in a chief executive and the company's losing money.
L:  Oh, exactly.  That -- that -- that's a little bit too much.  No, I'd be happy with --
R:  But the same thing --
L:  -- I'd be happy with that. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yeah, if that team's going to win --
L:  -- maybe I should be playing baseball. [LAUGH] 
R:  If they're going to win.
L:  Now, are you in Texas?
R:  No, I'm in Ohio.
L:  I- -- in Ohio.  Okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, then you're -- you're familiar with the Huskers then?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Being that close, yeah.  But yeah, like I said, sports, n- -- and last time I was on here they had me talk about ah, the news, well [LAUGH] I don't watch the news either.
R:  Well gee, you're not too informed then, are you?
L:  No I -- well I have kids so we watch cartoons. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you watch cartoons.
L:  So that's -- yeah --
R:  Well you would be interested in censorship in entertainment, I guess.
L:  Yeah, if they -- if they -- yeah, if they do a call about cartoons, I'd be right there. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd be doing great.
R:  All right.  How did you get on to this?
L:  Um, I had um, on an internet -- I belong to a -- a chat group and a lady had said, you know, she had signed up for it, so I went off and I signed up for it too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And the first time they called I thought they said, "Would you accept the charge?"  So I hung it up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Then after listening, oh, okay.  And I figured out who it was calling, it was that Fisher project.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, yeah, I'm sorry I'm not a very good conversationalist with sports. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well I'm sure college teams can't strike.
L:  No.  No.  You know, and there's plenty of college students that would gladly take their place, you know --
R:  Well I -- I -- I don't know about that, they can't strike, they're on -- they're on scholarship --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- they don't even get that much for that --
L:  You know --
R:  -- at least they're getting an education, supposedly.
L:  -- and even professionals --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they could find some good players who would take a lot -- lot less.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm sure they would, so they should just all be happy to have their jobs and -- and not -- not be striking with that.  I think --
R:  Of course, now the one thing about professional sports, they have a -- they earn all their money before they're thirty five or thirty three years old.
L:  Gee.
R:  And then they retire, I guess, or go into business or motivation[?]
L:  Or just travel.
R:  Coaching, lower salaried income --
L:  But that --
R:  -- so that -- or travel, even.
L:  Well --
R:  Give speeches.  [inaudible]
L:  With that amount of money?  Oh.
R:  They make all that money before they're thirty five years old.  They want to make as much as they can before then.
L:  See, that's crazy and if they invested that right, they're set for life.
R:  Well, if they invested it in the nineties they lost it all.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and maybe they'll build it back, but twenty five million?  Oh my gosh, that's -- that's about as crazy as, and this is off the subject, but ah, the recent lottery they had for two hundred and forty million --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's a lot of money. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Two people won, didn't they?
L:  Yeah, I think two people from ah, like, Pennsylvania --
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  -- and I'm not sure the other place.  Never in Nebraska.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We never win.  Our poor state --
R:  Do you play lottery, though?
L:  I try.  But I never win anything.
R:  No, I -- I don't even try.  I don't even believe in it.  I wouldn't -- I would think that would ruin my life if I won the lottery.
L:  Ah -- you know, I've heard other people say that, and that -- yeah.  There -- there's a lot of downfalls, you'd have all of a sudden a lot of friends and relatives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] That -- yeah.
R:  Well you would have not only that, but probably have such a personalized sum.
L:  Oh huge.  Huge.  You'd have people just walking in your front yard trying to fall down and -- and hurt theirself or sue you for something.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, there'd be troubles.
L:  Oh yeah.  But, you know, I guess --
R:  Well, you know like that one -- that girl out in Las Vegas that won the jackpot on the slot machine --
L:  H- -- how much did she win?
R:  I think she won like a hundred and twenty five million dollars.
L:  Wow.
R:  And she paid taxes on it, and she had like, seventy five, ei- -- sixty million or something.
L:  Gee.
R:  And then -- then she married her sweetheart.  She was a waitress, and then he divorced her, and then she had an auto accident, was paralyzed from the neck down --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- then she sued them and they -- she won that, but she's crawling[?] from the waist down at this point --
L:  Oh, that's awful.
R:  -- from the neck down.  She had all kinds of tragedies.
L:  Gosh.  Th- -- that's awful.  So she had a little bit of good luck and then it just went to --
R:  Well it was an awful lot of good luck --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] 
R:  -- winning that slot machine for a hundred and twenty five million dollars.
L:  See, I never even win that.
R:  Oh, I've won on the slot machines, but I don't win much on anything else.
L:  No, I -- I try the scratch tickets.
R:  Scratch tickets?  You don't win on that either --
L:  But you know, nothing, you know like ten dollars maybe or nothing -- nothing real big.
R:  Yeah.  Well these -- some of these sports figures, like, hit the jackpot when they get a big salary.  They play one good season and then they sign a -- a contract for like, two or three or a million dollars for two years or a year for three years, they hit the jackpot.  I don't know what happens to them after that.
L:  Ah --
R:  Usually they're not good, they don't play well or anything.
L:  But boy, they got more money than, shoot, I'll probably ever see in my life.
R:  [LAUGH]
