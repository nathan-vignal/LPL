R:  Yes, hi.  I'm Suzy.
L:  Hi.  I'm Charles.  How are you?
R:  I'm just fine thanks.
L:  Good.
R:  So, what --
L:  Um, so, do you wanna go first?
R:  Sure.  Um, changes if any ... [COUGH] Haven't actually made too many personal changes, ah, since September eleventh except for, perhaps, to get a little more politically involved in -- with things.
L:  How have you gotten politically involved?
R:  Um, actually, I've been to quite a few protest rallies.  Ah --
L:  Protesting ...?
R:  +Protesting, ah, America's involvement in the war in Iran right now.
L:  In Iraq or Iran?
R:  I mean, e- -- [LAUGH] sorry, in -- in Iraq.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] I was just --
R:  We're --.
L:  Well, they've talked about --
R:  We're not -- we're not quite there yet, right? [LAUGH]
L:  They've talked about Iran so, you know, I wasn't sure which one you were talking about.
R:  Right.
L:  That's okay.
R:  No.  N- --
L:  Okay.
R:  And so -- and just, kind of, I -- I think, ah, yeah, doing the email thing and, you know, I've been certainly a little more vocal with, um -- um, politicians in my area and, ah, you know, voicing my thoughts about, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what's going on in the world in general right now.  And I guess --
L:  Did you --
R:  G- --
L:  I'm sorry -- go ahead.
R:  I was gonna say, I guess those things aren't -- aren't directly, ah, related to September eleventh but indirectly, they certainly are.
L:  Yeah.  Did you, ah, protest the bombing in Afghanistan?
R:  Ah, yes.  That's one --
L:  You did?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, just -- just out of curiosity, what part of the country do you live in?
R:  I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  You're in Philadelphia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just talked to somebody from Philadelphia the last time I did this.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.
L:  Um --
R:  It's real popular here.
L:  Well, this --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This is from University of Penn, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That would explain it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LAUGH] --
R:  But where are you from?
L:  I'm in Texas.
R:  Okay.  I was actually --
L:  So, is --
R:  -- just in Waco, Texas not long ago.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I've been to Waco before.  I didn't really like it.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  Um ... [PAUSE] Um, anyway, ah, so, what about the, ah, bombing in Afghanistan?  Did you find, ah, you didn't agree with or --
R:  It, um [COUGH] -- well, in those cases I -- I think it -- w- well, it seemed to me, a case of us feeling the need to do something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because of September eleventh and not necessarily even having a direct contact or -- or proof of any involvement --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of any specific group.  We just, kind of, decided, "Okay, let's do something". [LAUGH] You know?  Kind of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- almost, ah, you know, r- reminded me -- we've had a couple of, you know, major cases in -- in Philadelphia and certainly in other places, where, you know, there's an assault or a murder or something happens and they just, kind of, arrest, ah, [LAUGH] the wrong r- -- person.
L:  They go after quick, swift justice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- instead of --
R:  I know and --
L:  And that -- okay.
R:  -- now, we're finding with all the DNA evidence, [LAUGH] you have all these people who've been incarcerated for years and years and --
L:  Oh, please.
R:  You know?
L:  You wouldn't, ah -- I don't suppose -- I live in Houston.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't suppose you've heard anything about the Houston Crime Lab?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.  They did a huge, ah -- I don't know if you wanna call audit or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on just the techniques and apparently, the Houston Crime Lab -- Lab got rated the worst in the country.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  And they've had people go in and, ah, t- -- find, like, all these cases of people --mainly, ah, people that were sent to prison for, ah, rape.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And find that they actually, ah -- their DNA did not match up --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what they had on the case.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's even, ah, stuff where the -- they found out the Chief of Police actually knew about this about four years ago about how disordered the crime lab was and people are, like, saying he needs to resign and all this kind of stuff.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's a huge thing.
R:  God.
L:  But, um --
R:  Yeah.  We --
L:  So, how would you have preferred the, ah, n- -- government or nation or whoever to proceed with events after September eleventh?  As far as --
R:  Um, I think I would've liked the -- liked them to rely a lot more on intelligence, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and going through, you know, not -- ah, I realize it's, you know -- it was a thing to get patriotic and -- and it was a horrible, terrible thing to happen to our country --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but if people, you know, o- open their eyes and see what goes on globally, there are people all over the world who suffer worse fates every day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah --
L:  Which is probably one of the reasons why, like, in some of the, ah, other countries when they heard about what happened here, it didn't really phase them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're, like, "Yeah, well that [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- that's, kind of, you know everyday life".
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess when --
L:  But --
R:  Th- -- w- w- when the question was, you know, how does it t- -- affect you directly?  Um, you know, for -- I think the majority of the people in this country, it hasn't really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- had much impact or change other than, you know, we get a green light and a red light and an orange light and, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's not much anybody does anything about it.
L:  So, you don't, ah, tape up your doors or anything when we're under an orange alert?
R:  Ah, n- --
L:  Put duct tape around your doors or anything?
R:  Just for mosquitoes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what --
L:  That's about the same way it is in Houston. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think I'm more --
L:  Um -- I'm sorry?
R:  -- afraid of wes- -- I said, I think I'm afraid -- more afraid of West Nile virus than anything else seeping in the house. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, who knows?  Maybe West Nile virus is a terrorist attack.
R:  A- -- it could be. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, well, as far as for me, ah ... ah, I ki- -- I -- I'm not sure where I stand on the bombing of Afghanistan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was not totally for, ah, us going into Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I really thought there was not enough evidence.  And, it seemed to me, you know ...  I mean, one of the prob- -- living in Texas especially, you get a lot of the conservative viewpoints.
R:  I would think so.  Yeah.
L:  And, ah -- ah, also I've found myself listening to talk radio a lot and talk ra- -- talk radio is almost completely conservative.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, although I don't agree with them all the time.  And it just seemed to me that a lot of the people that I heard talking about going into war with Iraq that were for it, it just seemed, like, misplaced anger.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just total aggression, "Let's go, you know, bomb the, you know, hell outta this person, bomb the hell outta that person".  You know, anyone that, you know, listened in that neck of the woods, "Let's just go get 'em.  Just in case".
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Ah, and it's just, you know ...  I really didn't think they'd stated the full case for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, once we did go in, I was, basically, of the mindset that, you know, I was gonna, you know, support, ah, the president, support the troops, you know, all that kinda stuff.  N- not -- and there's nothing really I could've done to support the troops, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whether in s- -- you know, I didn't bad mouth any of it.  Basically, my opinion was, hey, if, you know, we go in there and we do this and then we find out later that Bush was right about it, then, hey, you know, more power to him and I might, you know, even vote for him in the next election.  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Y- -- I didn't vote for him last time but maybe I'd vote for him this time.  You know, if he was right.
R:  Mm.
L:  And if he was wrong, then, jeeze, [LAUGH] ah, we better, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- find some little hole to go crawl into. [LAUGH] And --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause he w- -- I mean, he was putting the -- he really was putting the credibility of this country on the line --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for this one thing and, you know, it was really a huge gamble and a- as far as I can see, he hasn't really, completely, ah, lived up to that.
R:  No.  I mean, he's definitely lost it.
L:  His, ah -- his end of the bargain.  I mean, he really has made a debacle of the whole thing especially with how quickly he'd been pulling people out.
R:  Mhm.  And that --
L:  And now, I mean, we hear every day now about our guys getting, you know, ambushed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and little, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I mean, it sounds like street gang activity.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my roommate is actually in Greece right now and she said, you know, she doesn't even dare mention, [LAUGH] you know, much a- -- she's from Greek heritage but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and going to visit relatives and she's, like, "I'm not bringing anything [LAUGH] that has anything to do with America on it". [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Because she said they -- they are furious at the country right now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, you know, as most European and -- and most [LAUGH] other countries around the world are.  Then -- and we haven't done anything that -- I mean, that -- to prove what we said was there in the first place.
L:  I know
R:  So, it's -- you know?  And, ah, the other thing, I guess, even w- -- you know, I know you were saying whether he -- this was gonna prove whether he was right or wrong?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I- -- to me, that didn't even -- I mean, that -- of course that matters but the thing that really bothered me about it was just, sorta, the hyper patriotism and the fact that they were almost d- demanding and the country was getting to the point where they were demanding everybody fall in step with our leader and not dare question him.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, to me, that's a really dangerous precedent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, even if he's right, you still need to ask ques- -- you know, before you embark on something so big, you still need to ask the questions, like, why are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we doing this?  How are -- you know, are we sure this is the right thing?  And I know there was --
L:  I d- --
R:  -- um, a -- a senator, I believe, or a congresswoman out of Washington I think it was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she was, I believe, the only one who voted not to give him presidential power to declare w- -- you know, to go into war.
L:  Right.
R:  And she received death threat after death threat and horrible things.  I mean, they s- -- you know, smeared mud on her car -- all sorts of things.  I was, like, what -- what is the whole point?  I thought the whole thing that's so wonderful and great about America is that we can question and that we don't have a dictatorship so you --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- it's completely anti American to me, the way we went about things.
L:  That's very true.
R:  So --
L:  I mean, you know, and the thing that, ah, ge- --
