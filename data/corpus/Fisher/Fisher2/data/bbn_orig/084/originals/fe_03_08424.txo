R:  Hi.  I'm Jo from Minneapolis.
L:  Hi.  I'm Derek from New York.
R:  Hi Derek.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Wow.  New York.  What a great place to talk about September [LAUGH] eleventh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from.
L:  I know.  I d- -- that's what I was -- I was wondering who the person I was getting from --
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  -- would be from.
R:  You first.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah.  That was a crazy day.  I guess, ah, at the time I was l- -- now, I live in s- -- Manhattan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But at the time, I was living in Queens, on the south side of Queens.  Yeah.  It was just a crazy day.  I, ah, was woken up and then, ah ...  Yeah.  I mean, I heard the tower -- I was close enough to hear 'em, you know?  And, like, there was a smell for, like, a couple of weeks of just that, like, dusty smell.  You know, even as far as Queens, you know?
R:  Mm.
L:  You would smell it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, ah, b- -- what was the topic to -- for changes?  I wouldn't say I've made any changes.  Would you?
R:  U- um, well, changes happened but I didn't make 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Change- -- yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think as far as September eleventh anything, um -- you know, I've flown a couple a times.  You know, obviously, and the -- with the security, you, kind of, like, you know, a- at that point you're, like, "All right".  You know, where normally it would be a hassle.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess that changed that we, "Okay, you know, that's fine now" you know?
R:  Yeah.  But I didn't, like, cancel any trips or ...
L:  No me -- nothing like that either.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and I didn't even react by saying, "Oh, I'm gonna quick fly out to New York to visit everyone I know there".  You know, I thought to stay away was better --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and offer help from afar and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, 'cause I have a sister who lives there and a niece and stuff.  So --
L:  Where do they live at?
R:  Um, ah, well, my niece is right in Manhattan and my sister is just outside of New York so not --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- real close but she knew a lot of the firefighters and stuff so she was pretty devastated.  They --
L:  Y- --
R:  -- were friends of hers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that were killed.  So --
L:  Yeah.  That's sad.
R:  It was tough.  Yeah.
L:  It was a -- it was a bad day.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And i- -- you know, one thing I noticed that there's so many budget cuts in Minneapolis -- in Minnesota, you know, statewide and just this big devastation.  They're blaming it on September eleventh and I keep looking at 'em and going, "What the hell you think is happening in New York then?  I mean, they must be, like, zeroed out on their budget. [LAUGH] There must be nothing left".
L:  Oh, y- -- we're negative.  Yeah.  We're ne- -- yeah.
R:  So, have there -- have there been a lotta cuts to everything?  I mean --
L:  Um --
R:  -- severely or just --
L:  Well, some- -- [SIGH] as far as community stuff, I'm not really too involved in -- in -- in so much of that stuff.  Ah, I know some of the prices of things have gone up.  I know that much.  Like, the subway just went up from, you know, a dollar fifty to two dollars.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's, like, a residual effect.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and the buses too are -- you know, they jacked it up fifty cents now per ride.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I'm su- -- I mean, I know the city's, like, under budget.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know they're definitely, like, you know, in negative budget.
R:  But are, like, welfare programs cut more and stuff like that?  W- -- help for people, like, aid and --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- Red Cross and --
L:  Well, like I said, as f- far as community outreach and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I really don't know.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I -- 'cause I don't really know what they were like before.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  How old are you?
L:  There's always need -- excuse me?
R:  How old are you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Twenty six.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm, um -- I'm forty three and I work with at risk teens so I know a lot about, you know, all those aid --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- programs --
L:  Ex- -- okay.
R:  -- and what's been cut.  So ...
L:  I'm actually -- I just started j- -- you know, not too long -- for about a year now, I'm going to nursing school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like the -- you know, the, ah -- some of what I -- what little I know, I've just started to learn within the past year, you know?
R:  Oh, that'll --
L:  I've --
R:  -- be good education for ya.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, to learn about all those programs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I think that's --
L:  I actually --
R:  -- the wisest thing to direct people and where to go to get help.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, especially as a nurse 'cause you're gonna get people come in and who are insured and --
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Depending on where I'm working.  Yeah.  Of course.  Definitely.
R:  Yeah.  Huh.
L:  Yeah.  Like I say -- yet, ah -- I -- I mean, I know there is still, you know, programs out there but as far as, like I said, like, what changes?  I -- I -- I really wouldn't know what they were before September eleventh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I know the day of September eleventh, it -- it, kinda, changed my life that day big time.  'Cause it was -- I woke up and it was such a beautiful day I remember.  And I don't have the partner I had then or anything.  All that fell apart and I always blame it on -- yeah, I pretend, you know, like, "Oh, it must've been 'cause of September eleventh".
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but -- but I looked at him and said, "You know, i- i- -- this almost too unreal.  I'm so in love with you, the world is gr- -- everything just feels so good" and then I get a call from my sister hysterical.  She was, like, " [MN] [MN] [MN] [MN]".  You know, I thought she was faking it 'cause she's an actress out there.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm, like, "Jackie, cut it out". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And a- -- e- -- which is horrible [LAUGH] 'cause she was, like, "Oh, my god Jo, look -- turn on your TV".  I don't ever watch TV and I didn't even have a TV to turn on.  So -- but she told me what was happening and I, like, ran outside into my neighborhood and started asking people and -- you know, and then say, "Oh, no, they hit the, you know -- the Pentagon" and it was, kinda, wild.  It was a l- -- it was weird.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I -- I -- at the time, I was working a -- a later job.  Like, I was working from, um, [MN] -- usually, I would go in around noon or one o'clock.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, you know, about eight, nine.  So, I was working -- you know, like, that, kinda, happened early so, yeah, I got a phone call.  My mother was still living out here in Long Island at the time.  She was, like, "Oh, my god -- get up, look at this".  You know?
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Just -- 'cause that's a l- -- ah, usually, I'd get up by, like, nine thirty.  Ten is usually -- you know, I -- I -- I was a little later shift.  So, ah, yeah.  And I'm, like, watching the TV and, like I said, it was just [MN] i- -- on -- you know, I'm watching it on TV and then when the tower -- I could totally hear it outside 'cause --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it was a beautiful day --
R:  Weird.
L:  -- here too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They were --
R:  Well, yeah --
L:  -- on fire for, like, [LAUGH] a month and a half.
R:  I know.  That was what was weird.  I noticed people got more paranoid and I think that's the worst thing is for people to get more fearful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- we don't need that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I didn't go that way.  And I said, "You know what?  They hit us in our ivory towers".  I- if I was --
L:  Oh -- oh, yeah.
R:  -- gonna be s- -- terrorist group --
L:  Financially, they hit us right in the pocket.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And I said, "If I was gonna be a terrorist group, if I wanted to get back at the US -- which a lot of countries do -- they were -- you know, that was very devious".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  A- -- but it makes sense.  Um, it's, like --
L:  Yeah.  If you're a terrorist, I guess, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That's the best way to be a terrorist. [LAUGH] You know?
R:  Is to be s- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Terrify 'em and hit 'em where it would hurt.  And --
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  And to do in broad daylight and without, like, enemy planes that someone could detect, you know, use their own crafts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on 'em.  I- it's a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was an amazing thing.  I- it --
L:  Yeah.  That's why I feel bad for those people on the plane too.  'Cause up to that point it was more -- if you were a hostage on a plane, it was more -- all right, you know, most likely they're gonna make demands and usually they would land somewhere.  You were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably expecting something like that.  You didn't realize they were gonna crash the plane, you know?
R:  That's why it was amazing that group.  And it was led by, um, a guy from w- -- I know his parents are from Minnesota, I don't know if he was from Minnesota -- who led the charge, you know?  The, um --
L:  Y- -- e- --
R:  The plane that crashed.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um, h- -- my mom knows his parents.  I- -- she --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  She lives down in Texas with the -- you know, winters in Texas with them.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  And, um -- yeah.  For them to have the insight or just get the feeling that, "Hey, i- -- you know, we're dying so let's try to stop this".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Was amazing.  When it crashed, I knew it too.  I went, "Those people crashed -- a- -- help crash it".  You know, they knew --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That wasn't crashed by the terrorists.  It was, you know -- they got interrupted.  'Cause I don't think they would've crashed like that.  They would've crashed into something, you know?
L:  Y- -- which -- which -- which building though?  Which --
R:  No.  The plane that just crashed.  It didn't --
L:  Oh, oh, oh.
R:  -- crash into anything.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  The -- yeah.  Those hostages.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They were -- okay.
R:  'Cause I think that if the terrorists were more in charge, they would've crashed into a building and taken out some people.
L:  They probably had some target.  Do y- -- I don't know if this is true or a rumor but, like, supposedly the next day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they actually had -- 'cause, you know, how they grounded flights?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like --
R:  That was weird.
L:  -- the next day or so and certain- -- there was a few people they were caught who were planning on do- -- you know?  They -- they had --
R:  Doing more?
L:  -- all the targets.  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  Supposedly, they had other -- like, I think the Empire State Building was another target, you know?
R:  Wow.
L:  They had a few --
R:  Well, I know the Mall of America here in Minnesota was supposed to be one.  But people --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  People don't wanna shop there.  A lot of people have -- I -- I know people who haven't gone there since.
L:  Oh, really?  Wow.
R:  And -- and I know one guy, he's a- an upholsterer, he won't go into any place crowded 'cause he thinks it's a place where a terrorist would attack.  So, any grocery store -- he sends out for his groceries and everything.  So, a lot of people have become paranoid here, in Minnesota, even.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  Because I mean, ar- -- I -- I can say, every once in a while, if I'm walking to, like, Grand Central Station or Penn Station 'cause -- you know, I take the trains mostly where I gotta go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A- and every once in a while, you know, you just drop your day, you listen to the walkman or whatever and crazy thoughts come into your head.  And I've thought about it.  I'm, like, "Wow --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- w- -- that'd be crazy if something, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- blew up while I was down here or something" you know?
R:  Well, yeah.  You're very b- --
L:  You've thought about it.
R:  I mean, I think it would be whole another story if I was there compared to here.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think I consider my laurels here where you're, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- having to think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they couldn't attack here but --
L:  Yeah.  Of cour- -- yeah.
R:  -- you actually had it happen.
L:  Yeah.  But -- yeah.  No, sometimes you -- you know?  But for the most part, no, I pretty much go -- I mean, like I said, I moved into the city since the -- since then.
R:  [LAUGH] You are --
L:  So --
R:  -- really brave. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I know.
R:  Actually, maybe, you know, th- they'd never hit the same mark twice so maybe you're the safest. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] And they'll go elsewhere.
L:  Well, hopefully you're right.
R:  They'll hit California next.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sink it or something.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  So, wow.  Well, I hope you do really well with your nursing and stuff.
L:  Thank you.  I appreciate that.
R:  And I hope you never have a terrorist attack where you have to dress a lot of people at once as a nurse.
L:  Well, yeah, me too.  Me too.
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah.  Well, this -- yeah.  All the hospitals are starting to, you know, do more, like, emergency preparedness and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  So, they must really appreciate that you're in training?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah.  There's plenty of jobs around, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wh- when I -- when I'm done with school.
R:  And you're a native of that area then or --
L:  Yeah.  I was, ah -- I was, um, born and rai- --
