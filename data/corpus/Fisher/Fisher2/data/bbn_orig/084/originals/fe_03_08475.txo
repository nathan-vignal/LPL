L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Paula.
R:  I'm Donna.
L:  Hi Donna, well, I guess we get to talk about sports -- this is the first time I've done this.
R:  This is my first time, too.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] I --
R:  And I'm not -- I'm not real involved in sport.
L:  Me neither, I guess it said something about the strikes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, that -- well, I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  Um, you know, I think they get paid way too much money --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for what they're doing.
L:  I agree.
R:  I don't think any one person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is worth that kind of money.
L:  No, you're right.
R:  And then these -- these, ah, contracts that they sign for these, um, companies, you know, for advertising --
L:  Mhm, all the marketing and everything?
R:  Yeah, like that one kid just got seventy one million dollars.
L:  [SIGH] That's ridiculous.
R:  I know.
L:  And there are some of these people that I really don't want my kids looking up to, and seeing on TV.
R:  You're right, you know, I --
L:  Because their lifestyle is just so horrible [LAUGH].
R:  Koby Bryant, maybe?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Half of 'em.
R:  The most recent one.
L:  Yep, yep --
R:  And ...
L:  -- they come off all so clean and then all of a sudden you find out their real life.
R:  Right.
L:  So, but, yeah, I think they get paid -- I think teachers should get paid more than sports stars, actually.
R:  [MN] I do too, I think --
L:  So, anybody in public service.
R:  Right, they, ah ... they just um, are way, way out in space with all this sports stuff.
L:  Yep.
R:  And you know, the memorabilia, and the -- and the um, contracts and all the other stuff, it's just too much, too much.
L:  [MN] There should be some way for people to identify with each other, without, you know, feeling close to a sports team and having that do it.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, yeah ...
R:  And you feel like, if you don't identify with a sports team, you're just, you know, you're just -- nobody wants to talk to you hardly.
L:  Yeah, well I live in Michigan, and the Red Wings, you know, won the Stanley Cup so many times, and --
R:  I love the Red Wings.
L:  -- when it's hockey season, forget it [LAUGH].
R:  Right, I know, I'm from Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay, so you -- yeah.
R:  And ah, so we're familiar with the Red Wings.
L:  Yeah, so you're familiar with -- you have them in Ohio State too [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I --
L:  I grew up with all their stuff [LAUGH].
R:  But see, I don't get into all that --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- and ah, it's really hard.  I do have a superbowl party every year, but it's only because my husband's birthday is right then.
L:  Oh, yeah, so ...
R:  And I do it for him, to celebrate his birthday.
L:  Does he watch the superbowl, and ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  He gets into all the sports?
R:  Oh, yeah, um, well, no, really just um, football, and ah, auto racing.
L:  Oh, my husband likes to watch the auto racing.
R:  Does he?
L:  Yep, he -- every Sunday I guess it is.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I enjoy that --
L:  So I try and keep our -- you know, our daughter out of the way [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, um, I enjoy that too, we -- we both watch it together.
L:  Now, see, I'd -- I would watch a little bit of it, but in my opinion, when you race, you race and then you're done -- whoever got to the end w- -- is the winner --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you shouldn't have it last eight hours [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, they -- they drag it all out like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, look at these half time things on the um, football games.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Um, you know, that's what makes -- you know, it's like Nike with this agreement for this guy for this seventy one million dollars -- this kid hasn't even proven himself yet, and here they are paying him these big bucks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's no wonder their shoes cost so much.
L:  Well, it's not for his ability, it's for his, um, persona on TV -- how personable is he --
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  If he were really ugly and not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know -- not a sports star -- [MN] it -- I don't know, it's just -- the really ugly guys --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't get the big contracts for the Nike and all that.
R:  No, you're right, you're right --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I don't think so either. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, it's just another form of movie stars.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So ... did you need to get that?
R:  No, my cell phone's ringing -- I'll just ignore it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um [NOISE] ...
L:  It's probably another survey [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] You're not supposed to have, um, interruptions when you're doing this I guess, so I don't want to get it.
L:  Okay, yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  --  'cause I don't know what they're recording, but, yeah, I don't know, I think sports star- stars should get a take of the tickets --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, things like that, but other than that, the cars and the planes and -- all the extra perks, all they do is go hit each other.
R:  I know, I know --
L:  But ...
R:  -- beat each other up.
L:  Yeah, there's no skill in [MN] -- I can see where there's skill involved in the sport, but, still -- [MN] I think the teachers around my neighborhood handle everything with a lot more skill than sports stars [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, you're right, and -- and they add a lot more to society than sports stars.
L:  Yes, they do.  [MN]
R:  Um, I just, I don't know -- I just, I'm [MN] not -- not into all that.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think if we held them up to higher standards maybe, I don't know, but if they had a standard then they could lose their contracts, and, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- be reprimanded by the -- by the club that they play for, and so on.
R:  Well, it's like this baseball player that just hit that sausage [NOISE] -- did you see that?
L:  No, I hadn't -- didn't see that.
R:  The sausage was part of -- they were having a sausage [NOISE] race at a baseball game, and it was a, you know, a costume character thing --
L:  Oh, okay,
R:  -- and a baseball player [NOISE] reached out and hit one of 'em and knocked him over with a baseball bat.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And, [NOISE] didn't get any penalties for it [NOISE] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- oh yeah, two hundred and forty one dollars, I think.
L:  Oh, well that hurts him.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  That's not even his sock budget for the year [LAUGH].
R:  No, you're right, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you know, and that -- and you know, then we have our kids seeing this happen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he doesn't get any penalty for it, and there's gonna be no criminal charges of any kind, um, ah, in conjunction with it.
L:  Well, it's -- I mean, well, I don't know -- it would seem +humiliating -- humiliating enough to walk around as a sausage, to -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get hit for it too, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah, all the kids there saw it and that -- this is the way adults, you know, and our idols are supposed to act, there's -- they're not getting the right message +across, so ...
R:  That's my call waiting beeping in, and I understood we weren't supposed to have that on, and I don't know how to turn it off.
L:  Oh yeah, I don't know how to turn it off  -- I know there's a way you can turn it off when you dial out, but -- oh, well, just go ahead and get it, I'm sure it won't kill anything [LAUGH].
R:  No.
L:  They were trying to get a hold of you [LAUGH].
R:  No, it's my -- I know who it is -- it's my daughter, so ...
L:  Oh I was hoping it wasn't an emergency, because [SIGH] --
R:  I hope not.
L:  -- I -- my family gets impatient [LAUGH], when I'm on the phone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Um, um --
L:  [MN] Ten minutes is a long time when you're waiting for it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, it is, it is -- especially when you're talking about something you don't know a whole lot about.
L:  Yeah, I don't know anything about sport [LAUGH].
R:  Um, I think it's [inaudible] --
L:  I know a lot about a guy who bit a guy's ear [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah -- I can see, um, their right to strike, but I can't see their right to these kinda premium payments that they get.
L:  No, there should be some kind of a ceiling, um, commonsense ceiling, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I wouldn't even mind a -- a couple of million dollars to -- [MN] seeing as they take in so much at the gate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, it's -- it's raising the price for the -- you can't even take your kid to a game cheaply anymore.
R:  Oh no, no, uh-uh --
L:  You know.
R:  -- not even a, I mean, our local -- even the local, um, teams, like the Mud[?] Hens[?] -- you know, their tickets are half way decent, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- concessions are terrible at these places.
L:  Yeah, that's -- they make a lot of money there, too.
R:  Yeah, too much money.
L:  You know, I haven't been to a -- a game in a while -- I wanted to go to a Detroit Tigers game, but it [MN] -- well, I don't want to go to Detroit, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, no, I wouldn't either.
L:  -- and it's really expensive.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  So, and it's just due to all -- and baseball players, I think are some of the worst offenders --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in -- in a lot of the morality charges --
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- 
R:  But you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  --  look at the number of years that our kids looked up to OJ Simpson.
L:  Exactly, exactly.  When I was growing up too, you know, it -- the running through the airport and everything, he was just supposed to be this cool guy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and look what happened, and then he gets off scot free.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, they don't seem to have a lot of accountability for what they do, and their actions --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- especially when they're public, um, you know, public, um, people, you know?
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] I think you should have a little bit more, um, accountability for your actions than everyday [MN] -- well, day to day people yeah, but they're not out there in public, and everybody's not seeing them --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and using them as role models -- you know, us.
R:   -- we're accountable for what we do.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  But, they're not, because they're who they are.
L:  They're famous.
R:  Right.
L:  People have this false sense of intimacy because they see them everyday on TV, and they feel that they're closer to them than actually the people they are -- they see everyday.
R:  You're right.
L:  And so, they think, "Oh, well you're my buddy", and these people get away with -- scot free, with everything.
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  So, it's just nuts, I don't know, but, [SIGH] I don't have to pay it [LAUGH].
R:  No.
L:  And I don't buy into the [inaudible] and blue thing, so hopefully I'm not --
R:  [MN]  
L:  -- financing this stuff.
R:  No, I don't either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I just don't -- I don't get into any of that.  A little bit of that superbowl stuff, and that's only for the reason I told you, and --
L:  Yeah, well, and you know --
R:  [several inaudible words] my husband.
L:  Yeah, if I do a Red Wing party or something, it's just because it's my neighbors and my friends, and -- [SIGH] and they're all watching the hockey game, I could care less, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But if they lose, you don't see people having the parties.  You know, if they're not in -- in the running for the cup or anything, you don't see people wearing the Red Wing coats as much, and having their little flags on their cars and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So ...
R:  Yeah, you see a lot of that during the cup.
L:  [SIGH] Yep, you do, it's -- it's -- they just wanna be part of something cool, I guess.
R:  Yeah -- yeah ...
L:  We -- we -- yeah, we're taught to look to the outside for things instead of just staying home and, you know, having people resp- -- I'm getting old [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].
R:  [inaudible] what?
L:  I'm running on [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, well, me too [LAUGH].
L:  You know, we've gotta talk about something -- record this people [LAUGH].
R:  It's a very hard -- it's a very hard subject.
L:  I know, if we were guys it wouldn't be that big of a deal, because we could chew stats and [SIGH], you know --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- and all that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and actually know their names.
