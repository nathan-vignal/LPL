L:  Hi, I'm [inaudible]
R:  Hi, I'm Lesley.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing good, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from New Jersey.
R:  Oh, I'm in Seattle, Washington.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about, um, athletes.  Is that what they said?
L:  Well actually, I didn't understand.  What is the topic?
R:  What?
L:  Ah, I didn't understand the topic, actually.
R:  Oh, strikes by professional athletes.
L:  Oh, strikes.  Okay professional athletes.
R:  Yeah, do you think they deserve the money that they get paid?
L:  Um, well I think they're well paid.  Most of the athletes get a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.  I think they're way over paid too.
L:  So um, I think going on a strike would definitely be not appropriate.
R:  Yes, 'cause --
L:  It really doesn't make too much sense because they're earning -- they make so much money.  How much -- how much more can they make?
R:  It's just because they're in competition with each other, I think.  They think that person makes that much so I want to make that much.
L:  Probably.
R:  But it's not like they're performing brain surgery or anything, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're playing sport.  Essentially[?]  
L:  But um, um, but actually I'm not aware of um, I mean this is a general topic or it's a current topic? Are these -- are the athletes going on strike?  Or is it just the athletes that we're discussing?
R:  Um, I don't know if they're going on strike right now.
L:  Okay.
R:  I know that people have, you know.
L:  Okay.
R:  Hm.
L:  But um -- but then how -- I mean, why would they go on strike?  What are they demanding?
R:  Um, probably more money or um, longer contracts with more money, you know what I mean -- 
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- 'cause it's been -- when athletes go onto like, a basketball team or something and they sign a contract with a five year contract --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for like a million dollars, for instance, let's say.  And then if they're playing there for like two years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then they sign someone new for the five year contract and they give them two million dollars, then other people get mad, and they're like, you only gave me a million.
L:  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  That's how it works?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  No, but I think it -- it -- it's a contract.  A contract is a contract.  If you agree to that contract when you signed it, I guess you should stick to it.  Going on strike would probably not make sense.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  A think another thing that happens too is that um, say it's a basketball player for instance --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if they come on the team, and they're like, not that good but then they get ba- -- they get really good and they become like a big star like Michael Jordan or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R: -- and they feel like they're not getting paid what they're worth --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they probably could go on strike because of that also.  And another -- another facet to that is that um, when you get really famous like that though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you get so many promotion deals and everything, so I think they're just being greedy.
L:  Yeah, you have the endorsements to care of ah, that, you know, your -- your sudden stardom.
R:  Mhm.  Exactly.  I wouldn't -- I would be happy.  I'd be happy just to be doing what I loved for a living, and you know, if I loved the sport that much --
L:  Oh yeah, I think that -- that -- for -- for a sports person to have a career in sports, I think that's like the best thing.  You don't actually work and you -- you get paid for it, just playing, so I mean, it's like the best thing that could happen.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they're being a little greedy.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  But ah 
L:  And um, [COUGH] but I mean, I -- I -- I don't think a lot of strikes have happened though.  Are -- are -- are they too often?  Do these strikes happen too often?  I haven't read about any lately.
R:  Oh I haven't either.  I -- I think, wasn't there a couple of years ago that like everyone in baseball like went on strike? [LAUGH] Like a lot of people did.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Teams, like whole teams did I think.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm not sure.  I don't follow sports that much, but --
L:  Neither do I actually.  I'm -- I'm new to the country so I really don't follow American sports so much.
R:  How long have you been in the country for?
L:  Ah, around ten months now.
R:  Oh really?  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from India.
R:  Oh.  Well welcome. [LAUGH] 
L:  Thank you.
R:  You're welcome.
L:  Thank you.
R:  What are you doing in New Jersey?
L:  I'm ah, I'm studying.  Um, I'm doing my MBA in finance from ah, New York, University in New York.
R:  Oh wow.  Is it nice up there right now?  Is it sunny?
L:  Ah, the weather is pretty good.  It's not all that sunny, it was, ah, very um, hot a -- a week back but this week is pretty okay.  Pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  We're warm here.
L:  It's like ah, late sixties, so it's nice.
R:  Yeah.  It's been like sev- -- it's been like in the eighties and nineties here.
L:  Oh wow. [LAUGH] That's nice.
R:  It's been pretty warm.
L:  Yeah.  That's hot.
R:  Oh, I like it.  I like it when it's hot.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH] Did you ever play any sports at all?
L:  Ah yes, I do.  I -- I play basketball, racquetball, I do swimming --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and table tennis.  Actually I'm not pretty good in any kind of sports but, um, I do play a lot of sports.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How about you?
R:  Um, I did dance team when I was in high school. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I love to dance.  I love dancing.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  So -- if I --
L:  Any -- any dance in particular, or ?
R:  Um, like jazz.  I took a lot of jazz classes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I did a little bit of ballet but not much, just 'cause I'm short and I have horrible [inaudible]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  You know what that means?  It's not -- it just makes you [inaudible] so [LAUGH] But I like it -- it's a really nice expression, you know?
L:  Yeah, it sure is.
R:  So.  That's if you can shake, too.  Which I could do if I got into it. [LAUGH] So 
L:  [LAUGH] And um, so are we um, um, when you um -- no, I'm a little confused as in how does this work?  What -- why -- why am I talking to you?  How -- how does this project work?
R:  Oh, they're just studying voice, ah, the way people talk.  Their speech patterns.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think it's for, um --
L:  So you don't -- do you have to stick to the topic that is actually -- ah, because we -- we've gone -- totally off it. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know [LAUGH] This is the second time I've done it.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  And last time the girl and I that spoke, we couldn't talk about what we were talking about either.  It was like, if you could go back in time and change one thing what would it be?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm like, "Oh, nothing".  She's like, "Yeah, me too." [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So that was the end of that topic.
R:  Yeah they probably just want to see the speech patterns.  I think it's for that software when you talk --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you speak to the computer and it -- it writes it down for you, you know?
L:  For how long does this project -- is this project going to go on, or are you aware of anything or you just ah, another person just ah --
R:  Oh, how long is -- is this session going to last?
L:  -- yeah, are you involved in the project actually?  Or you just um a participant?
R:  No, no I'm just that.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  But um, I'm not really sure.  When I called the lady I told her to call me back if there was any other ones.
L:  Okay.
R:  I wanted her to tell me about the other ones they were doing [inaudible] 'cause hey, I'm pretty hard, you know?
L:  Yeah, I mean, that's the reason I'm calling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So.  Oh, that's nice.  So what do you do in Washington?
R:  Um, I'm just waitressing right now.  I'm actually moving today.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm moving to Portland.
L:  Oh okay.  And 
R:  But um, I want to go back to school really bad.
L:  Oh, okay.  So you want to get into college?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [several inaudible words]
L:  So you did your high school and then you were out of co- -- I mean, you didn't go beyond that?
R:  No, I just went to high school and then um, started working --
L:  So --
R:  -- but I'm only -- I'm only twenty.  I graduated in two thousand.
L:  Oh okay.  Okay.
R:  So I'm --
L:  So want to be going into college and then are you taking your SAT's and stuff?
R:  No, I never took my SAT's.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Well I did some running start[?] when I was in high school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I took um, like, twenty five credits at the college when I was in high school --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but I kind of [inaudible] a little bit, but I just didn't -- I need some grades, I was too lazy in high school, you know, I needed to go have fun. [LAUGH] I'm really a dud but I'm not[?] having too much fun now so I need to go back [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.  It's pretty bad if you take a break and it's a long way then it's difficult to get back.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's not too long.  But I guess this is my third year.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, two thousand to two thousand and three, three years.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what I want to study though either.  I just feel the need to go and take some general courses.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm thinking about photography.
L:  Any -- any -- was there any college in particular or ?
R:  I'm sorry, what?
L:  Any -- any college in particular you want to go into?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.
R:  [inaudible] I'll probably just go to community college for a little bit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, just explore that.  I don't know.  I -- I really have no idea to tell you the truth. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I just want to do something.  I like to -- I like to do everything and I'm okay at everything that I've tried, know what I mean?
L:  Okay, so no -- no really particular interest?  It's just like --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I've enjoyed everything.
L:  Oh that's nice.
R:  Except for math.  I could not be a mathematician.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] But, no.
L:  And um --
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty four.
R:  Okay.  What made you decide to come to America to go to school?
L:  Sorry?
R:  What made you decide to come to America to go to school?
L:  Well actually I have a lot of ah, family in the US, and ah, and I was like, I -- I finished my studies in India and I was working for two or three years and I was like, I want -- I mean, I -- I always wanted to come to a new country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah, you know, explore my opportunities and see if I can do something here.  Just move out of home
