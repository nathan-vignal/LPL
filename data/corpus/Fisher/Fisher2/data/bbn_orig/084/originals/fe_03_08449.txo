R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [SIGH] I'm Vicky, how are you?
L:  Good, I'm Laurie.
R:  Hi Laurie.
L:  Nice, to meet you [LAUGH].
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  I suppose [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, um, September eleventh, hm ...
L:  Yeah, big broad topic?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, like, I could talk about that for hours, I mean [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I [LAUGH] -- normally I guess I like, I could too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [MN] I guess they wanna know about changes we've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we've made in our lives, and, I don't know if I've really made that many changes in  my personal life.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I do the same things -- I still fly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I still travel, I go to cities --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I suppose I'm a little more cautious anywhere I go, but I've always been a somewhat cautious person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I can't think of anything I've really done to change my personal life.
R:  [SIGH] Me either, I was try- -- I -- I was thinking about that, and -- and -- and I don't know, I mean, we live in a very small rural community, so [SIGH], you know, as far as [MN] personal worries here, of course, we don't have any, but we're not far from where the plane crashed in Central Pennsylvania, so, you know, that -- that was kind of a big deal for us because it was only like an hour away where the plane crashed, where flight ninety three crashed and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and um, my son was five when -- when the attacks happened, so he remembers seeing that on TV and for -- we, for the one year anniversary, we did go out to the flight ninety three memorial crash sight and -- and ah, you know, talked a little bit about that, and -- and that was a big thing that I wasn't ready to talk to him about yet, you know, the-- the possibilities, of -- of, you know --
L:  Something like that happening.
R:  -- yes, yes, so you know, other than that, you know, well, I guess [MN] showing my patriotism a little bit more -- I've always been very patriotic, my husband and I both were in the military, so, you know, we've always been supportive of -- of the military and stuff, but, that's ...
L:  Yeah, I -- [MN] ten minutes, wow, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, I mean, I'm the complete opposite -- I live right near the city --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, right afterwards it was weird, because I lived in a high rise building --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and, all you heard overhead for the first few days was, you know, helicopters and jets and planes and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's cr- -- that was, you know, was creepy, but, after, you know, a week or so, you know, life just went back to normal and even, you know, my husband works in town, in a, you know, a big highrise building --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't worry any more than I would have about anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I happen to work in a religious building --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, in a synagogue actually, so there's some heightened security --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where I work, but it's nothing I do personally, and it doesn't even phase people after the first, you know, day that -- they get used to the, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the locked doors, and the buzzers on the building, so, in that sense, you know, nothing's changed, um, you know, I got -- actually got married two months afterwards and you know, a lot of people missed our wedding 'cause they wouldn't fly, but that was really the only change in my --
R:  Uh-huh [LAUGH].
L:  -- personal life, um, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- people were afraid to come --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, but, you know, nothing, I -- I -- I, you know, I -- I don't think many people around me have changed that much either --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the people I see -- I think that most people, even if right away there were issues, I think within a few weeks everyone pretty much has gone back to, just, normal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just, kind of just paying attention to what goes on in life, which ...
R:  [SIGH] I agree, I think, you know, that's the biggest thing, um -- two of my siblings travel all across the United States for work, so, every week they're on a plane to some different State or city, you know, and -- and they said, for them of course [MN], they -- they were very leery in the beginning, even the first coupla months, because they travel so frequently, but, you know, they say that doesn't phase them now, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  I actually -- I flew recently and -- and I had a one way ticket --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I was totally screened --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I got the pat down, the whole thing.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And instead of you know, being upset about it, I kind of went into the whole thing knowing I had a one way ticket, knowing I was going to be subject to the whole thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I just went in with a smile on my face and I think, you know, the people there were just like, "Wow, you're smiling" --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm like, "Yeah, whatever -- what else am I gonna do?", you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just read a book?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, and -- and -- you know and --  and most people, I have to say -- everyone who got selected for the security, either they were re- ready for it, or just happy because everybody walked away saying thank you and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's just kinda become a fact of life, and --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's -- and I -- and I think, you know, deep down we all have to realise that -- that -- that it is for our own security, so, why be upset about it, and you know, just -- just deal with it, and be pleasant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause if you make it pleasant for [MN] e- everybody, you know, then everybody will get used to it a little bit faster [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Hopefully.
R:  I, yes -- I personally have not flown since then, um, we actually -- we were supposed to go away [SIGH] two weeks after September eleventh -- it was like, the end of September, we were supposed to fly to Florida --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, but of course, you know, for like the first week there were no flights at all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, we just went ahead and cancelled our plans --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, and we actually haven't got a chance to fly since 'cause my s- -- my son was sick and had to have some surgery on his ears, so they're like --
L:  He can't fly [LAUGH].
R:  -- "No flying", [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it hasn't been an issue.
R:  No, no.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Ah ...
L:  I mean, ri- -- yeah, right after our wedding we were gonna go to Italy and said, "Mm, now's not the time --"
R:  N- no. 
L:  "-- to be flying to Europe" [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH] Exactly.
L:  You know.
R:  Exactly, I -- I think [MN] of all fears, an international flight might scare me most, only because, you know, you just don't know -- I mean, you never did know, but now the possibility's even more in the back of your brain, you know?
L:  Yeah, it -- yeah, it's kind of the --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- yeah, and especially, it's more to me -- was more going someplace internationally --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it was more being in Europe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- especially right afterwards, and dealing with the, you know, anti Americanism and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the [inaudible] against American citizens, and -- that for me was the -- was the big kicker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it wasn't even the flight, I guess, because I've been flying -- I've lived up and down the east coast, so to fly -- for my family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's kinda like -- get on a plane and go, if I wanna see my mom, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's kind of -- flying has never been an issue for me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, as -- well, it's always been an issue for me, but not moreso now [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, you know, and -- and that, but I --I -- you know, I live in an apartment and I take a train, I -- you know, work in a -- in a place that's often considered a target --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] I just -- I can't, you know, I can't change what I do -- I worry about my husband every day, but not any moreso than ...
R:  You would normally.
L:  Than I would normally, I don't think.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, at least not on a conscious level.
R:  Exactly, exactly [SIGH] ...
L:  It's -- it's the subconscious that kind of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, when the subconscious thoughts kind of creep into you --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, like when the train's ten minutes late coming home, or --
R:  [SIGH] Exactly.
L:  -- that's -- that's more the worry.
R:  Uh-huh, I agree, you know, and we live -- my sister lives down near DC, so we've gone down there a few times and -- and when the terror level is raised, you know, that's -- of course, my son just absolutely loves it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- getting to see all the hummers and the [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the -- and the military guys, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  [SIGH] And, that's -- that's -- that's kind of intimidating as far as for tourism, but I personally felt much more secured by it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, but I'm sure, some people are just too concerned, you know, about it, and -- and my mother and father in law were just like paranoid -- they did not want to go anywhere [MN], up until, I think they just went away the past -- last month, for the first time since September eleven, [SIGH] but, you know, they're -- they're older and they've lived in this rural town their entire lives --
L:  So leaving is scary in of itself.
R:  Yes, yes, and I mean, you know -- my husband and I lived in Seattle --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, you know, we've been all over the place, so --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- for us, it's just kind of like, an adventure.  Now, of course, I'm a little bit more hesitant, now that we have a child, but, you know, no more than I think I would be normally.
L:  Right, because -- it's not what would happen to me, it's what will happen for him.
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  Right, which is very understandable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I -- I get more scared driving down a highway watching, you know, trucks go in and out of lanes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, you know, for me there's a lot more scary things [LAUGH], you know, w- -- you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- ah, worrying about, you know, my family as they travel, you know, that's -- that's the normal, that's -- but, the -- the September eleventh, nothing's, you know, really changed, you know, they said after September eleventh, always know where your exits are, and always know this and that -- and I always did that -- I was always the person who walked into a restaurant and looked around to see which the quickest way out was.
R:  Exactly --
L:  You know?
R:  -- exactly.
L:  I know where every exit is in every movie theatre I go to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, yeah, since [MN] -- September eleventh it -- it -- you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [MN] nothing's changed, except I'm also, I guess, more conscious of -- of what people think of America, actually --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is something I'm more conscious of.
R:  [SIGH] Yes, and unfortunately the -- the image has gotten worse [MN] s- -- instead of better and -- and that concerns me, being pri- pri-, ah, prior military [MN], you know, [MN] my concern is, you know, the -- the -- the guys over there getting, ev- -- in Afghanistan, and in Iraq --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, paying the price for the anti American attitudes and [MN] -- and that's very +disheartening because you know, we [MN] -- we may have overstepped our bounds in a few places --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on certain issues, but in all honesty, we did it to protect them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and to protect our own interests --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- you know, and I think, you know, think of all the people that Saddam killed, and -- and -- and Bin Laden has been behind, and, you know, and here we are, this little country compared to all of the other countries in the world, and we're the ones that always managed to ...
