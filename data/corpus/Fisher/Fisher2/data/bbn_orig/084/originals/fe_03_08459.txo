R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this Lisa.
R:  Hi, my name's John.
L:  John, how are you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  Good.  We're supposed to discuss changes that we've made after September eleventh.
R:  Yep [LAUGH].
L:  Have you made any?
R:  Um, not really but I've become more aware of, like, when I'm travelling, like, what's going on and how -- what kind of security measures they take in airports.
L:  Do you travel --
R:  I'm only twenty.
L:  -- a lot?
R:  Yeah, once in a while.  My family always goes on vacation.  I'm only twenty.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah [MN].
L:  Okay, so what -- what [SIGH], uh -- what impact did September eleventh have on you?
R:  Oh, it was pretty devastating 'cause I was, like, in college -- I was in the dorm and I saw the events happen on TV.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I saw the plane crash live so I was just like, "Whoa".  It was unreal.
L:  So, you're in college, are you away from home?
R:  Oh, I -- I'm back at home right now for the summer but I'm normally in college.  I'm a junior now.
L:  So, you were away from home when -- on September eleventh?
R:  Yep, I was eating breakfast when I saw it happen on TV.
L:  Yeah.  So, did you -- did you -- well, did you do anything specifically at that time?
R:  Uh, I emailed my mom and told her all about it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then she email- emailed me back and then I watched the live coverage all day long for at least a week 'cause they had stuff on it every day.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  What'd you do?
L:  [SIGH] You know, I -- I haven't made any changes, I -- I've just come back from, um, a two month vacation in Europe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I -- I s- you know, it certainly is -- is, um, apparent that some security measures have increased but not -- not so much of, um, in other countries as it is in -- in the US I find.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, for instance, uh, I was going through security at -- at one airport and I had -- I'm a smoker so I had -- I had two cigarette lighters in my pocket, which of course I have to take out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and put on the thing so then the security guard said, "Well, you're only allowed to have one lighter on the plane --"
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  "-- so which one shall it be?"
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I took one and gave him the other one but I thought, "I think I have some more in my purse" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I wasn't sure if there would be -- and sure enough so I had a -- I had two more in my purse [NOISE] so they obviously escaped the, um, uh, the x ray or -- or they didn't look or whatever because I ended up having three cigarette lighters on so if that was a security measure, um, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  But I travelled through the US, um, in -- at Christmas time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and had to take my shoes off and I'm a little old lady of sixty.
R:  [MN]
L:  So -- but that was fine.  I got to sit down and rest while -- while they examined my shoes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, um, that -- that of course was -- had to do with that, uh, other guy not so much -- well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I suppose it was part of the same group.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause what they do is also, um, we're in line --
L:  Pardon.
R:  Yeah, what they do with us is that we're in line and they start opening up bags and did this special, like -- they get to check for like explosive traces or anything.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, but they -- you know, w- I -- I -- I suppose the human -- a human person can only do so much to, um, of preventative measures --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, like, nothing is ever safe proof, it -- it's the same as -- as, um, burglary prevention to your house I kind think if somebody wants to get in they'll get in anyway regardless of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, of course, it's a deterrent.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, so personally I haven't -- I really haven't made any changes.  I think I'm gonna have to change the phone because this is -- this is beeping which means my battery is low.
R:  Uh-oh. [MN]
L:  So, that's all right, I'm on a portable one and, uh -- but we're supposed to talk here for ten minutes.
R:  Yep, I think we have, like, five minutes left.
L:  Yeah [NOISE].  So, you do the talking now.
R:  Okay. [MN] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Now, let me just beep the other one in here, hold on.
R:  All right.
L:  Are you on this one?
R:  Oh, you have the new phone now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I haven't really changed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that much at all [MN].  I just -- I just -- noticing things at airports is basically it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And hearing all the stories about how they've heightened security here and there and [MN] I don't know, I haven't really noticed it anywhere else besides the airports.  Except I notice, like, in movies they're -- have some thing about you couldn't have any, like, references to the Twin Towers for a while.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They cut some scenes out or some stuff.
L:  We were -- what about bridges and things like that?
R:  Yeah, anything -- any sort of plane crashing into the building they won't let 'em in the movies for a while.
L:  They what?
R:  [NOISE] They won't let anybody, like, have any planes crashing into things --
L:  No.
R:  -- for a while.
L:  No.
R:  But now I think they've softened up a little bit afterwards.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so whereabouts are you?
R:  Oh, I'm -- I live in Michigan.
L:  Oh, you live in Michigan. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Canada.
R:  Oh okay [MN].
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  How's it up -- what's the weather like up there?
L:  Oh, it's fabulous.
R:  That's good.
L:  Absolutely fabulous but, as I said, I just came back from an extended trip --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I haven't -- I haven't had time to, um, really be out and enjoy it yet.  Too much unpacking --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and cleaning up and -- [SIGH] and gardening and that type of stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I work for the city so I'm outside all the time.  I do some gardening myself [MN].
L:  Oh yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I pick weeds, I plant flowers [LAUGH].  All that stuff.
L:  For the city.
R:  Yep, and mow lawns, all outdoor stuff.
L:  Uh-huh. [MN] Are there any, um -- did you work there last year also?
R:  Yep, just for a summer job.
L:  Yeah, did -- did you -- do you notice any security measures that the -- the city has taken over and above what they used to in the past?
R:  Oh, not really, it's like -- they basically want you to wear those orange vests everywhere so people can see you, what you're doing.  Uh, I don't think they've really -- have anything to do with September eleventh, I don't think they've --
L:  No.
R:  They used to make us call the police if they see -- if we see anything suspicious, like, some people vandalizing something or any- anything like that but nothing to do with terrorists or anything.
L:  Yeah, well I'm -- yeah, well I suppose that's kind of suspicious to, you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- never know so you just -- you just have to call --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the police then, do you?
R:  Yeah.  If anything -- if I see anything like weird going on, like, we live by a -- I -- I mean, I work by a river kind of so we have people jumping off bridges there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so we have to call the police for that all the time.
L:  [NOISE] Well, yeah, I guess so [LAUGH].  Not the ambulance?
R:  No, 'cause the water's deep enough to walk but [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, just today, like, kids vandalizing so I had to call the police for that 'cause [MN] yeah.
L:  What were they doing?
R:  They were breaking bottles in this picnic area, which is dangerous 'cause then people can step on the glass.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it sounds like, um, you haven't made any changes and I haven't made any changes --
R:  No.
L:  -- other than -- than an awareness I suppose.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I suppose.
R:  I'm aware now that it could happen, like, at any time or any place.
L:  But, you know, the thing was, um, when I was travelling I was more concerned about the war than I was about --
R:  Yeah, September eleven.
L:  Well, I guess -- I guess the Iraq war and -- and -- and terrorism and -- and that it -- it's all sort of coming from the same part of the world so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so one ties in with the other but -- but that was a concern, um, [MN] because I had booked -- I had made all my plans before the war --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then -- and then when that started then I thought, "Oh, now what?" you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I -- I -- I feel life has to go on.
R:  Yep.
L:  The way it always has, we can't -- uh, can't let ourselves be ruled by [NOISE] -- by the loonies --
R:  Yeah [MN].
L:  -- if you will.
R:  Have to keep on going.
L:  So, what -- what's the weather in Michigan.
R:  Oh, it was really raining today [LAUGH], lots of rain.
L:  Was it?
R:  But it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Lots of rain.
L:  Well, you know, I live in, um, I live in a rainforest.  I live on the coast.
R:  Oh.
L:  In British Columbia.  And coming back you wouldn't [NOISE] believe I don't think there's been a drop of rain, uh, since I left.  Uh, there's no grass [NOISE], it's all brown, it's [SIGH] -- like a lot of my, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I lost a rhododendron, it's all dead.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I just have to pull that out.  It's too bad you're not up here then I could enlist you to come and help me.
R:  Ha, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm -- I'm pretty useful now [LAUGH].
