R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm EJ, I'm in San Francisco.
L:  Uh, my name is Bruce, I'm in LA.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you.
L:  Same here.
R:  So, do you exercise?
L:  Every other day, um, I either walk or ride my bike for forty five minutes.
R:  Oh, nice.  That's --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- good.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, a few times a week I, um, I -- I go to do an aerobic workout and, um, lift weights and everything and --
L:  So, you're into it.
R:  Yeah, I love -- I like, um, I mean I wouldn't say I'm addicted, but I, like, I miss it when I don't do it, so and this past week I was away, so I'm -- this week I've been kind of edgy, 'cause [LAUGH] I'm like ready to get back to it.  Um, but, yeah, I love --I love exercising and --
L:  It's interesting, uh, in the ad that I saw, uh, in the paper that I -- where I found out about this deal, it -- they wanted men.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And it sounds like, uh, but I've talked to -- this is my third call [COUGH] and twice it's been in women, so I guess it doesn't matter. [MN]
R:  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.
L:  I talked to a lady for a long time, this is all about computerized, uh, voice recognition, this whole survey.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I think they're more concerned with our voices and our locales than they are with the actual topic, but we might as well talk about the topic.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess.  Uh, oh, okay, I didn't under- I didn't know what the -- I didn't know exactly what the study was studying, I --
L:  Yeah, I talked to a real nice young lady, uh, at that university, I'd just seen a book review on the book notes, uh, program on, uh, CSPAN about Benjamin Franklin, he founded that university and she didn't even know that, so I said --
R:  Oh, a-
L:  -- "Well, you should get this book, he was quite a guy and that was his proudest accomplishment was founding that university" --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's the reason I did it --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- 'cause I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- figured it was legitimate.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  You're pretty -- you're young, right?
R:  Yeah, in my twenties.
L:  Yeah.  I'm fifty eight, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I have to do something, or otherwise, uh, I really -- I really feel it when I, you know, skip, uh, more than a couple of days.
R:  Yeah, I, uh, I have to do it just 'cause I have too much energy. [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good way to get rid of it.
R:  Yeah, exactly it's -- it's a great stress reliever, too, um, and living in the city I walk almost everywhere, too, so --
L:  I love San Francisco, I've -- I've just visited it a couple of times, but I gotta get outta here.  I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I am going to head north, but it's pretty expensive there, isn't it?
R:  It -- yeah, it's gotten a lot better now that the dot com is over, so --
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah, I'm in social work and I've now been able to afford a -- to live in the city.
L:  Oh, that's good to know.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's doable now.
L:  Hm.
R:  Um, I'm not saying it's cheap, but it's doable. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well LA's not cheap, either.
R:  Yeah, it's a -- it is a little bit more expensive than LA and gas is definitely more expensive, which is another reason you should just exercise, because [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean a car here is very expensive.
L:  I know, but have you ever tried ri- riding a bicycle?
R:  Yeah --
L:  For --
R:  -- I love to ride a bike.
L:  Of course in -- in San Francisco it would be -- it would be a real, uh, challenging with all the hills and everything.
R:  Well, it depends, I have, like, a biker map and it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- shows you how to avoid [LAUGH] --
L:  To find the flat areas?
R:  Yeah, how to find the flat areas.
L:  'Cause bikes are so much fun, I'm not kidding you.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not -- it's not like exercising, it -- it's just a little ad- you go on little adventures.
R:  Yeah, I actually, um, am going roller blading this weekend, um, and it's a great -- we have Golden Gate Park too, so it's such a great place to ride your bike or roller blade or something.  So -- unless it's foggy, of course.
L:  Yeah, I came into that city one day, um, I was travelling north alone and -- that -- there's that overview, there's a lookout off highway one, I guess and -- and -- and it rained just previously, God it was just stunning, that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- city, that bay and that bridge and the city, it was just sparkling, gleaming white [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  -- one of those postcard days.
R:  Yeah, yeah LA's not quite as, um, scenic, I don't think.
L:  No, LA's an ugly place, I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- got on a -- I live close to the ocean, so I spend a -- I -- I take the bike path --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- down there and it's fun, I, uh, but you can't do it in the summer because it's too, uh, packed, you know, it's dangerous.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  It's funny, when people go to the beach, they get spellbound, they -- they -- they don't look where they're going, they're --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know what I mean?  They're, I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're -- they're people from inland, they probably haven't seen the ocean in a year and they're just in a daze --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so you gotta watch, you know, you gotta watch out for them and their --
R:  Or --
L:  -- kids and their dogs and --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- it's too big a challenge in the summer.
R:  Oh, definitely, I can imagine.  So, are you originally from LA?
L:  Yeah, I've been here all my life.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Which is rare, 'cause most people aren't natives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hardly anyone I meet, a lot of people are getting out, like I want to do, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially around my age.
R:  That's right, San Francisco's, um, very transient, most people leave though when they're, like, in their forties or so.
L:  Right, yeah, I've waited, I think I'm, uh, I've waited too long, my brother got out about twenty years ago.  He went north, he used to live in, uh, Quincy --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which is up in the mountains and then he moved -- he went -- eventually he went to Alaska, he went everywhere, now --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- he's settled, finally settled in Missouri [SIGH] --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  -- he bought five acres of land with a brand new house, two story house --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- three bedrooms, two baths, for eighty thousand dollars.
R:  Oh, God. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that wouldn't happen here at all.
L:  You couldn't -- well, you couldn't buy a condo.
R:  No, no, you can't buy a --
L:  You know, as --
R:  -- condo for under, like, two hundred thousand --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the city.
L:  Crazy.  Well --
R:  And the --
L:  -- he loves it.
R:  -- condo, it would be very small --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, I -- I don't blame him for loving it.
L:  So, you're a so- you do social work to help people, um, that are needy?
R:  [NOISE] Yes, I work in the schools, actually I'm, uh, I provoke, I um, [NOISE] provoke the kids with, uh, with exerc- ca- exercise campaigns, um, but, um, yeah, I work on drug and violence prevention and then I -- I do, like, fitness and health training with them, so --
L:  Sounds like a good job.
R:  Yeah, it's fun, I'm, like, what other jobs you talk about sex and violence and drugs all day? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like --
L:  My ex wife works with the California [COUGH] Youth Authority, helps --
R:  What's that?
L:  My ex wife works with the California Youth Authority --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- where she helps gang -- ex gang or whatever, she tries to get gang bangers to stop killing each other and get a --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- job.
R:  -- that's a tough job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a very tough job, so --
L:  Yeah, she used to work for Big Brothers and Big Sisters.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, she's kind of, you know, once -- one of the -- one of the good guys, like you.  I'm an artist, so I just kinda stay alone and --
R:  Oh, artists are good people too.  What kind of medium do you use?
L:  Everything.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  I'm getting old, so I'm getting, um, my work's getting smaller and more labor intensive and I don't do so many big things anymore, but, uh, I used to work in television as an artist, as a graphic artist and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- been an artist all my life.
R:  Oh nice.
L:  Except you don't get to see people and, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  [NOISE], it's a -- it's a one -- it's a -- it's a solitary, uh, deal and as I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get older my friends, uh, we went through some wild times back in the sixties so I'm losing my friends around me or they're dying off.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Unfortunately.  Some of them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- never cleaned up their acts.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, but you're young, you've got everything to look forward to.
R:  Yeah, it's great.  It's exciting.
L:  And you're exercising at your age.  See, I didn't start exercising until I hit about forty --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and at -- at that point you have to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I've always been a dancer and I love to dance --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- um, and I was kind of getting to that point though where I was, like, I want a, like, a cardiac workout, though, 'cause I -- I was realizing that, at my -- at my job, like, you know, I'm chasing after kids [LAUGH] and I was, like, I want to get all this energy that they give me out and so, um, I needed something more than just the dance class, so, that's kinda how I fell into it, but I love it, so --
L:  You're lucky --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- it's good.
R:  -- I am --
L:  And a lot --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- of people don't like what they do.
R:  Yeah, I like what I do, I like --and it -- that's the other thing with exercise is, [MN] is exercise is the same way, you gotta like -- like it. [LAUGH] 'Cause some people just go and do it and I'm, like, "You gotta like what you're doing".
L:  That's -- yeah, that's why a bike is really -- for me at least, like, I -- I'll do both, I'll ride my bike over to the park and then I'll walk around the park a couple of times --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- but, uh, and watch the Latinos play baseball or whatever.  So it, I -- I kinda make it so it's enjoyable, 'cause I -- I -- I really hate just exercise itself.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, me too.
L:  I'm not that disciplined.
R:  Right, yeah, I, uh, if I had to -- if it wasn't fun, I wouldn't do it, so --
L:  There you go.
R:  Fun and affordable. [LAUGH] That's the key. [LAUGH]
L:  Bikes, though, is the -- the thing that it's -- they -- they can be danger- um, I've -- I've had a few crashes, been lucky where I haven't gotten, you know, really hurt bad.  I broke two ribs once, but I mean --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you can get hurt --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so you have -- you have to keep your eyes open all times.
R:  Yeah, you do have to be very aware.  I've had a couple of bike incidences.  Roller blades are just as scary --
L:  Yeah --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- you can get hurt, too, yeah, I don't even do- I mean, I don't even think about roller bla- I see the -- those, like -- the -- people like you going by me, passing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- me like I'm standing still and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, young people with energy.
R:  [MN]
L:  One guy's got a -- [COUGH] two pit bulls that he has pull him --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- on --
R:  -- my God.
L:  -- on his roller blades and one day they came around the corner and I mean, I got two pit bulls run -- run -- on the wrong --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- side of the bike [inaudible] I've got --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- if I would've crashed I would've been eaten alive[?]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah --
L:  But somehow --
R:  -- oh, that's --
L:  -- we missed.
R:  -- scary.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's lucky.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Very --
L:  It's exciting.  This --
R:  Very --
L:  -- what number call is this for you?
R:  My -- this is actually my third.
L:  Me too.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  I heard --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- uh, on one of the recordings that it takes like, six weeks till they get -- till you get your money.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'd like to do this every night, at a buck a minute it's a good deal.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- to talk to people all over the place.
R:  It's fun ...
