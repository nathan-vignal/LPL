L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, name is Gabby.
R:  My name is Anne, and I'm from Maine.
L:  Hi Anne, I'm from California.
R:  Jeeze [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from one place to the other.
L:  Absolutely.  So, the topic is September eleven, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  Have you made any changes?
R:  Um, yes, I have.
L:  You have?  What kind?
R:  Um, basically what we've done -- we lost two people to September eleventh, here in the -- in Lu- -- in my town.  
L:  [MN]
R:  They were flying to California for a wedding.
L:  Oh no, that's awful.
R:  Ah, it was the first time her husband had ever flown --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and this was their second marriage, and her son was getting married in Flor- -- ah, excuse me, in California --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, they were the second plane to hit the tower.
L:  Oh -- that's awful.
R:  So -- so, yeah, it was -- it was -- you know, I think everybody knew someone that was on -- either in the towers, or on the planes --
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know?  Ah, since, ah, September eleventh here -- I live right on the Canadian border --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, the Canadian border and the Americans, ah, they've really, ah, put more, ah, national guard -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they have increased the amount of um, customs and immigration --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- ah, three of the terrorists came into Callus[?] which is about an hour from me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, when we go across the bridge we're very cautious about -- we don't pick up anybody any more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, we don't do a lot of different things that we used to do.
L:  Right.
R:  What about --
L:  Oh.
R:  What about with you?
L:  Um, well, I've really -- at first I was a little, um, scared of flying, but now I have gone back into the swing of things, and -- to tell you the truth I haven't really made that many changes, um, [MN] when September eleventh happened we were supposed to fly the next day for our wedding which was in Annapolis, New Orleans, and um, we had family and friends here from Europe that had to, um, go back home and ob- obviously all the flights were canceled and they missed a lot of work, and um -- so, needless to say they haven't been back out to the US unfortunately --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so that's about the only thing that, you know, affected me personally -- my friends overseas [inaudible] to come and see me anymore [LAUGH], so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Are you -- are you originally from California, or are you from Europe?
L:  No, I'm from Europe.
R:  Oh, are you?  What -- what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, country.
L:  Germany.
R:  Germany?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, I [MN] -- are the, um -- are the +Europeans -- are the European flights more dangerous?  I mean, is that why they're not coming to visit you, or -- or -- or what?
L:  Oh [MN], because they were here during September eleventh, you know?
R:  Okay.
L:  I think that it really -- it really hit them hard, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I think if people that were in the US at the time that it happened were um, pretty shaken up by it -- I think if they were in Europe they -- they would have felt bad about it, but they wouldn't of known the extent of it all, probably --
R:  Right --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- and they probably wouldn't of got all the live coverage from the t- television either.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  No, it -- it -- it does -- it does -- and because there are still more terrorist attacks, I mean, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- New York has been hit again -- well, not hit, but I mean, New York has been targeted again --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, that was on the news, like, what?  Two, or three days ago --
L:  Mm
R:  -- that there was two or three places, and then in California about the bridge --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they had mentioned on the TV that there was places up there that they had, ah, put up, ah, more national guardsmen --
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  -- it was sad to watch cars and trucks going across the bridges out there.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So -- because --
L:  The one thing I can tell you is, in Europe they have really tightened up the security flying overseas to the US, um -- I was just home in May and, man, let me tell you -- it took two hours to go through security, for a [inaudible] --
R:  Well, [MN] -- you know, it always has been because my -- I have a fr- -- a very close friend that lives in Frederick, Marylands --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and her husband is from Scotland --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and Dolf said that for years and years and years, I mean, um, all the flights going out -- you know, coming into this country was always very, very secure.
L:  Mhm [MN].
R:  And, he said that if, ah, United States, had of been a little bit more alert --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that they would of caught these guys before they ever did anything.
L:  Mm, mm, yeah.
R:  But I mean, all these -- all these guys trained for -- for these planes, right here in Florida.
L:  Right.
R:  And three of the terrorists came in from Callus which, you know, they had records, all of 'em , and they just breezed right through --
L:  Right, right
R:  -- so now the customs and the immigration are checking all these IDs and if you -- and unfortunately this is a bad thing too, I think, um, just because you act a little different they'll pull you aside and they'll go right through you stuff, I mean, completely --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one of my, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of my best friend's daughters came from Connecticut --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they want to go in -- she's married, she's got [MN] three little kids -- they were going into Cape Britain, Canada for [MN] three or four days -- well god, at the bridge they told -- they tore their suitcases apart, I mean, they just went right nutty, because she's married to, um -- oh, he's from Afghanistan, or someplace -- she met --
L:  Oh, yeah, hm.
R:  -- she met him -- she met him in college, a long time ago --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- he's a really nice guy, I mean you never -- you couldn't -- couldn't ask for a better guy --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but because his skin was different, I mean, they really gave him a real hard time at the -- at the customs.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And they shouldn't be that way.
L:  No, no.
R:  And it's just like in New York, I mean, you've got some people that, um, you know, wa- -- you know, have the -- the mosque and all this other stuff, and you know, it -- it's not right to target them, because [MN] they had nothing to do with these terrorist attacks.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I mean, they've been in this country for a long time.
L:  Right, right, yeah, I think we all have to put up with a little heightened security and a little, you know, uncomfortable questioning, just, you know, for sake of safety, so ...
R:  So, a lot of the religious freedoms are being taken away, by this homeland security thing, I mean, right now, if they have probable cause --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- which is nothing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they don't have to have -- they don't have -- you don't have to have a search warrant any more --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- to come into your home.
L:  Right, yeah, that's true, that's true.
R:  And you don't -- and they -- and the FBI or CIA can tap your phone without your knowledge --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I mean, it's -- you know, our civil liberties have just kinda gone out the door because of a few terrorists here.
L:  Mm.
R:  And that's not right, because that's why --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we came to this country, was for civil liberties.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And I really [MN] --
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's true -- it's sad that they took that away from us, it's really sad.
R:  Yeah, because, I mean, when -- when you go into an airport now, ah, the scan thing --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- ah, comes right up in your face, I mean, you don't know it's there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's against your face, and it goes to a -- a database, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everybody that flies, they know exactly where they went and when they came back.
L:  That's crazy, isn't that crazy?
R:  It is, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  That's absolutely crazy, wow.
R:  But as far as me going across the border, I go, you know, like I say [MN], ah, Campervaile[?] is right next -- right beside Lubec[?] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah, it takes, from my house to -- to a foreign country, it's ten minutes.
L:  Right, right, yeah.
R:  And, ah, I still go there, and I, you know, have friends over there, and -- it does take a lot longer at the border though, because what used to -- would take maybe three -- three -- three minutes, now takes about ten.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, well ...
R:  So how -- so how did you find out -- find out about this, ah, ah, study yourself?
L:  Ah, volition -- volition dot com.
R:  Who?
L:  Volition dot com, it's a -- it's a site for mystery shoppers -- it --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- it's -- it's like a forum, so ...
R:  How do you -- how do you spell it?
L:  It's, ah, V.O.L.I.T. --
R:  V.I. -- okay --
L:  -- I.O.N.
R:  V.I. --
L:  L.
R:  L.
L:  O.T.
R:  O.T.
L:  I.O.N.
R:  I.O.N.?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And what is that, now?
L:  It's like a forum for --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- mystery shoppers, yeah.
R:  Okay, dot com.
L:  So, look into that -- it -- it's pretty interesting, they have some pretty interesting things on there.
R:  Because, you know, I have a computer and stuff, and a friend of mine called me and told me about this, ah, about this study and -- and she said you can get thirty bucks, I says, "You're kidding me" --
L:  I know, isn't that great?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you won't be laying around, huh?
R:  Yeah, well [several inaudible words] -- everybody could use some money right now -- my boyfriend's outta work, he's been outta work now for about three months --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and the economy's terrible out here.
L:  Right, right.
R:  How is it in California?
L:  Um, [MN] we're doing okay, we're doing okay -- it's not -- it's not that bad -- it has declined, but it's not ...
