R:  Hi.  I'm Jennifer.
L:  Hi.  I'm Jason.
R:  Hi.  That's funny -- that's my husband's name too. [LAUGH] There's a lotta --
L:  So, I --
R:  -- Jasons and a lotta Jennifers.  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  So, they are very common names.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  How you doing?
R:  Not too bad.  How are you today?
L:  Doing pretty good.  Stuck in traffic.  I figured I guess it's a good time to call.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's something to do rather than sit there and want to slaughter the person in front of you.
L:  That is -- [LAUGH] pretty much.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So, our wonderful topic today is, what changes, if any, have you made in your life since September eleventh?
L:  Okay.
R:  Um --
L:  Who wants to start?
R:  Well, I can start.  I really haven't made any because I've lived outside -- I've lived on the outskirts of an air force base almost my entire life.  So, I've always been moderately paranoid. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, ah, s- -- I mean, I haven't really made any changes, ah, in my life either.  I mean, there are people in my family who are, you know -- don't like getting on planes and will -- will rethink it but, ah, I -- I mean, I don't mind flying and I -- I get on a plane all the time and I really haven't made any changes in my life.
R:  I'm from a family of pilots.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I -- I don't even think twice about getting on a plane.  However, September eleventh, I panicked because I was at work and I knew three of my family members were due to fly a plane that day.
L:  Mm.
R:  And -- or be on one at least.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that was, kind of, terrifying 'cause I was not sure if, ah -- and well, my step brother was supposed to be on the flight out of Boston that crashed.
L:  Wow.
R:  And he had traded with some other guy that day and lucked out.
L:  [LAUGH] Awesome.
R:  Otherwise, he would have been on that one flight.  So --
L:  Wow.  That -- that really -- that really hits close to home, huh?
R:  Yeah.  It was -- but it still doesn't change how I feel about being on a plane.  You're still more likely to have something bad happen to you in a car.  Not that I wanna say that while you're in a car but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I -- I -- I agree.  I mean it's, you know -- you face more risks every day of your life than you do when you get on an airplane and, you know, you can't start changing everything in your life because of what happened.
R:  Well, if you think about it, far more people were injured either in their cars or in their workplace [LAUGH] that day than actually on airplanes.
L:  Sure.
R:  So, you know, ah, statistically speaking, you're not at any more risk that way.
L:  No.  I know.  I agree.
R:  However, I am glad they finally have decided to arm the pilots 'cause my -- my family member's that are pilots --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they all, pretty much, have been advocating arming the pilots in some way, shape or form, for the last fifteen years.
L:  Really?
R:  Right.  Because, you know, if there's -- you know, if it's a hostage situation, if the pilot had a way to lock the door properly and then turn around with a weapon, then there wouldn't be a problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  When you come from a family of pilots it changes your perspective a little bit too.
L:  Yeah.  You really ring a whole new look on it.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  My step dad is a pilot and my step brother and his wife.  So, I'm like the oddball.  No, I didn't go. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No flying school for you, huh?
R:  No.  I'm a nursing student actually.  So --
L:  Okay.
R:  So -- and did you -- when everybody was out -- going out making their anti terrorism kits, did you make one?
L:  Anti terrorism what?
R:  Anti terrorism kits.  You know, the little chemical warfare kits?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Where everybody was going and buying duct tape and --
L:  No.
R:  -- plastic seal?
L:  No.  Not at all.  I -- I mean, yeah, what is -- what is duct tape gonna do for you?  Um, I -- you know, I haven't done a thing different.  You know, didn't go out, didn't buy anything.  Ah, you know?  It's --
R:  My family, ah -- like, my grandparents, went out and got all their duct tape and their water and all that and I said -- I said to my grandma, I said, "Can you honestly tell me that in under five minutes you can duct tape and seal all of your windows?  I don't think so".
L:  [LAUGH] Re- regardless, what -- what is duct tape gonna do?
R:  Well, actually, if you use duct tape the proper way in combination with plastic, you can create an airtight seal around your doors and windows.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Theoretically speaking.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  However --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, who --
L:  The y- --
R:  First of all, how many people are gonna be able to do it properly?
L:  Right.  It's gotta be perfect.
R:  And second of all --
L:  There can't be, you know, one hole, nook or cranny and you're -- you're, ah, screwed.
R:  Yeah.  And the other thing is, you know, who's gonna be able to do all that in five minutes?  'Cause you have to do every door, every window, every crevice in your house.
L:  That's true.
R:  And that includes your ventilation system, which most people forget.  I said, you --
L:  N- --
R:  -- know, "I'd rather die quickly than slowly".  So, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  But I live outside of a military base where we're, like, the number two target in the United States to get hit with a nuclear bomb.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you just, kinda, take a, "Oh, well" attitude [LAUGH] after a while. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That makes sense. [LAUGH] I bet you don't like hearing that statistic.
R:  Ah, well, yeah.  And I grew up here so I mean, I -- I spent all my childhood years' here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right outside of this base.  I -- I live, like, three minutes from the front gate.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Ah --
R:  And the whole city is surrounded with missile silos.  I- if they're gonna --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- hit us, we're gonna be post toasties anyway.
L:  [LAUGH] Where d- -- where do you live?
R:  I live in Montana.
L:  Okay.
R:  I actually live outside of Great Falls, which is where Malmstrom Air Force Base is.
L:  Okay.
R:  They have one of the biggest strategic air command units in the United States.  My dad used to be missile maintenance.
L:  Mm.
R:  So -- before he retired.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, so, you know -- and I have lots of friends who are military here.  So, I know what the statistical probability is of us getting wiped out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If we're gonna get toasted here, it's not gonna be chemical warfare or anything like that.  Somebody's just gonna ho- -- come over and nuke us.  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Hello?  Ah, well, let's hope that doesn't happen.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the good thing is though, if that ever does happen, at least I'll be in the immediate kill zone rather than the radiation, slowly fall apart zone.  So -- you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I'm pretty blase about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But when you grow up around it, you just, kinda, "Yeah.  Okay.  That's what's gonna happen".
L:  It, ah -- yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, by the time I was, like, eight years old, I knew what nuclear winter was.
L:  Huh.  That's something you want to what wait around, like --
R:  Yeah.  You don't normally learn about that until you're at least a little bit older.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  My son, I haven't -- I -- I have d- decided not to terrify the hell out of my children though.  So, I've tried not to mention anything in front of them.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  'Cause I have three and I don't want them to grow up going, "Oh, god, what if I get blown up?"  Y- you know?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But -- yeah.  I've -- ah, now, the whole September eleven thing didn't do much to me.  Um, kind of, pissed me off though 'cause I grew up in a community where there were, ah -- there was a very large Hindu population.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's where I found[?] my teenage years, which were on the West Co- -- I mean, on the East Coast.  I lived at -- on the East Coast as a teenager.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And a bunch of people got pissed off and burnt down one of their temples.  Okay --
L:  Mm.
R:  They're Hindus.  They're not Arabs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  There's --
L:  People are stupid and naive.  They don't -- you know?
R:  I was, like, "Okay, you're burning down Apu.  Do you even know what you're doing?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I had lots of Hindu friends as a teenager so it was, like, "Are -- is everybody this stupid?  Do they not know the difference?"
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  I mean, up here there's -- and we're right up next to the Canadian border, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, if they -- my uncle -- well, my uncle in law, my father in law's brother -- w- went up to the border to go across 'cause they -- we had some business up in Canada.  Well, we were laughing 'cause we hadn't thought about it but, um, my friend -- my husband's family is, like, third generation American.  They were Syrian --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before.  And his passport says his first initial and his middle name, which is Hassan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and his last name, which is Eli.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which -- they stopped him at the border, they searched his car. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  They searched everything.  I mean, they ripped his car apart.
L:  Really?
R:  Because of his name.  'Cause they were sure [NOISE] he was a terrorist.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some kind of Arab terrorist going through.  Ah, you would have to know Uncle Butch.  I mean, he's just -- he's as all American as it gets.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it was just incredibly hilarious.  But now, the family doesn't wanna go across the border for anything, 'cause with our last name, we all get tagged.
L:  Wow.  That's -- yep.  So, that's -- that changed it.
R:  Na- -- yeah.  Um, I guess that changed.  I've never been a big one for going across the Canadian border anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Except for when they have the occasional concert up there 'cause, um, Alberta's not that far away and they have big concerts van- -- concerts come through Vancouver up there and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm in Montana.  Nothing comes here.  Okay?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  I've never been there.
R:  Just -- suffice it to say, it's flat and windy and there are some big mountains but there are no hills.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And everything is dead. [LAUGH] M- --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] [LAUGH] --
R:  It -- well, it rains but there's -- it's so flat that there's just drought.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, there's very little trees, it's not shady.  It's a semi arid desert, technically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you get very little green and if it is green, you know it's got a sprinkler system somewhere.
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Now, where I spent my teenage years, it was green all the time.  But here --
