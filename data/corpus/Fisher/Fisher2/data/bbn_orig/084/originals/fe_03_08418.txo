R:  H- hi, my name is Karen.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Hi, my name's Lisa, I'm from [NOISE] Alabama.
R:  Hi, I -- I from, ah, Michigan, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- Grand Rapids Michigan area.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]  I am actually -- we're -- we're with the military so, I guess, September Eleventh, --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, it's -- it's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- affected us somewhat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because [SIGH] everyone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we know has kind of changed.  There's been a lot of military activity since then.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  R- right.  That would have put you really on, ah, [NOISE] like, ah, -- ah, alert --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more ... basis.  I mean we're [NOISE] just so used to in the [NOISE] United States to being ... sheltered and protected.  I think it was such a major wake up call.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But, [SIGH] well we're not in the military and nobody in our family is.  [NOISE]  Um, [NOISE] so -- I -- I do have a daughter playing[?] in the National Guards.  But, ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] ... for us I don't think it's r- really -- i- it's just, ah, -- more of an awareness of -- of we not as invincible as we thought we were, [NOISE] but it hasn't changed [NOISE] the way that we travel or anything.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  For us, um, -- for our personal lives --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as far as travelling --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or going on vacation or [SIGH] visiting people, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do that about [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the same as we did before.  That hasn't really changed.  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I've got two children from -- my younger one [SIGH] who was in -- he's going into fourth grade now so he was in second grade at the time.  [SIGH]  For him it probably gave him a better awareness of what his dad does for work.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And I think it was probably a little scary because [SIGH] we are in a military base and he goes to school on base.  [SIGH]  They basically had to close down the schools and lock the kids into the schools.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, he had a lot of awareness because of that.  We were also on what used to be an open base where anybody could drive in and out of the bases [SIGH] and they don't let people do that anymore.  [SIGH]  So, now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he's gotten used to the security guards and cars being checked with everybody that comes in and out of the bases.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, he's gotten used to -- they've put in -- they've put ... barriers in front of buildings that he was used to having open.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Even the youth center where he goes to after school, it used to be that you could drive right up and drop your kids off.  [SIGH]  Now you have to par- park about a half a block away and then walk the kids over.  [SIGH]  So, I think some of our net- -- some of our innocence was lost.  I think [SIGH] that's exactly it when we're stationed overseas [SIGH] you expect things to be different, but one of the nice things about the United States is that anyone can walk anywhere and do anything.
R:  R- right.
L:  [SIGH]  And I think it's changed that a little bit.  It reminded us that, you know, [SIGH] we're not as [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- impenetrable as maybe we thought before.
R:  Ah, right, you know, [SIGH] -- and you're right and I think it's, as you say, innocence lost there.  That's exactly what it is.  Our children are growing up with a whole different mindset and we just -- our children are growing up knowing that, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there is war out there.  And -- and even though we went through wars when we were growing up [SIGH] I think it was a little ... further removed because it was never on United States soil.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, and here it's on our homeland and -- and we were attacked.  And [SIGH] it's our children that are growing up knowing that, that that's a possibility because they -- they were there when it happened.  [SIGH]  And for us, I -- I think as parents -- a- at least for me it makes me, [SIGH] [NOISE] u- um, insofar as my children are concerned it's -- i -- I -- I -- I guess I maybe a little more aware of where they are and what they're doing, [SIGH] perhaps than I was before.  [SIGH]  I was out of town ... on September Eleventh [NOISE] and I was actually on a bus trip [SIGH] and it was such a feeling of helplessness, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] um, not being able to get to my children.  [SIGH]  See it still affects me today.  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I -- I understand --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- completely what you're saying.  It's -- it's hard to know that, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] -- you know, you like to, sort of, feel like you can protect your kids and those that are around you.  [SIGH]  And that even if ... s- something happens that's disastrous, it's going to come [SIGH] -- you're gonna --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- have some warning of it, you know.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, I have a relative died of cancer.  That's a horrible thing but at least [SIGH] -- as horrible as it is you know it's coming, you kind of have time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to prepare for it, you know it's gonna happen.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  Something like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't prepare for.  Nobody got up that morning thinking ... that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we had an enemy or that anything was going to go wrong.  [SIGH]  A- ah --
R:  This is this today, y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Exactly.  On top of that my husband's a p- pilot.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So, um, before that I'd have people all the time say, "Well, aren't you afraid that he flies?" and he [SIGH] actually flies experimental aircraft and a lot of that kind of stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I was always l- like, "No, I trust him.  He's fine".  [SIGH]  A- and --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-uh.
L:  -- it -- it did make it really hard because all of a sudden I had to realize that, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, on top of worrying about the aircraft he's flying, a- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- his flying abilities, -- you have to worry about some idiot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that might be up there --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- trying to do harm.  [SIGH]  And I think --
R:  R- [LAUGH] right.
L:  -- that really bothered me for a while.  With his job he goes away a lot and has to do a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- l- lot of ... going to other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- places and manufacturers to fly stuff [SIGH] and --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the first few --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- words I was, you know, I was [LAUGH] -- it -- it kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- got to me a little bit the first f- [LAUGH] few times.  I think.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]  But don't you think it's real easy just to slip --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- slip back into the complacency that we were in before?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, we see all the new, um, -- [SIGH] a- ah, security measures put in place at the airports and -- and, ah, -- like you were saying on the military bases.  [SIGH]  Even though that -- that's a constant reminder, I think it's real easy to slip back into that feeling, "Well, we're safer now" [SIGH] and really we're not.  [NOISE]  If somebody wanted to do something again [NOISE] they could.
L:  [SIGH]  I --
R:  They could.
L:  -- I think that's true.  [NOISE]  I think that's one of the problems is that ... I think sometimes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we want to feel safe [SIGH] without having to do the hard work to be safe.
R:  Right.
L:  And the truth of the matter is it's -- it's like anything else [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if anybody wants to hurt you [SIGH] they can find a way --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to hurt you.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [SIGH]  And I think it's one of the reasons we've tried not to change the way we live because [SIGH] whether we're vacationing [SIGH] down the street in, you know, a port[?] or Alabama town [SIGH] or if we go to some place --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like New York City [SIGH] there's still a chance --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- that someone could come and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something horrible can happen to you.  And I -- I just don't think you can live your lives [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- waiting for that moment to happen.
R:  R- right. 
L:  You know, nobody wants that to happen to you but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think you've let them win --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] if you --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- let them take over your life to that point.
R:  Right.  And -- and at that point your just living in a cave [SIGH] and what kind of life is that?
L:  [SIGH]  I think that's exactly right.  But, you know, --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- it has made us [SIGH] maybe appreciate the idea that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you don't always have to put off till tomorrow.  We always spend --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of our time talking about, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, putting things away for when the kids are older and worrying about this and worrying about that, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think now [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we do try to spend a little bit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more time making sure that we're having fun, ... in the --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- moment a little bit more.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess you can always find a b- benefit in everything that h- happens.
L:  That's it -- that -- that's true.
R:  Right.  [COUGH]  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know it did, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go right across the United States.  It seems like families grew closer.  And [SIGH] just people that were estranged from each other -- people were calling people they hadn't talked to in y- years.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  Or else it's just ... touching base and to see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that comfort again from -- from making contact with people, and people that you love.  [NOISE]
L:  I think that's true.  I think one of the negative impacts from September Eleventh, though, is that [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it did give prejudice a chance to kind of kind of r- rear its ugly head right away.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Um, --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] anybody that looks like they were [SIGH] --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- from a middle eastern country or had any kind of middle eastern descent.  [SIGH]  I mean, we would watch TV and one of the things my husband and I talked about a lot are people that were obviously from India.  [SIGH]  We were getting the im- --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, they were getting the impact --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of people who were middle eastern.
R:  E- exactly.
L:  [SIGH]  Just because I t- think we want --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to have a specific enemy that you can look at and you can say, "Okay, that's the person to blame".  [SIGH]  And I think that's a big danger.  You have a danger of going back to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the World War Two days when the Japanese --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- were put in the internment camps.  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And what -- what we need to understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is it doesn't matter what that person looked like.  I mean, look they found that [SIGH] -- the one kid they found over there he grew up in California in a --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- upper middle c- class -- [SIGH] upper middle --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- class family [SIGH] and he was involved in it.  Anybody can be involved --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in a terrorist activity, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's an activity of hate.  It doesn't have anything to do [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really with ethnicity or race ... in the end.  [SIGH]  And I think -- I think it's, -- you know, we have to worry when we're trying to look at people and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] by looking at them figure out who's the ... good guy and who's the bad guy.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's, ah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] o- oh, I forgot what I was going to say.  [SIGH]  I guess it couldn't have been too important but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] yeah, a- [LAUGH] ah, but I tell my kids that, "Yeah, I honestly forgot.  It couldn't have been too important".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- yeah, I think it -- it's -- I think it's more the way -- the way kids are raised you know, [SIGH] and you can't -- y- you, ah, this is the hardest thing to say or maybe to -- to think about but you really can't even blame ... the terrorists because [SIGH] they're spoon fed from day one when they're born, "America is the enemy.  America is trying to destroy us.  Americans are trying to kill us".  [SIGH]  And when their -- grow up in a country where [SIGH] [NOISE] their television is restricted, their newspaper r- reading is restricted, um, any access to news of any sort is restricted [SIGH] and a- all they're hearing are bad things about the United States.  And ... [SIGH] they don't have any idea what the United States [NOISE] really stands for, because they've never had a chance to know that.  And --
L:  I think that's true and I think [SIGH] it also means as Americans, though, maybe w- we need to re-look [SIGH] at the image --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- we p- portray of ourselves to the rest of the world.  [SIGH]  You know, we are --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- a great country.  We have many great things, many powerful great people who have done wonderful things in our country.  [SIGH]  But, um, if the way we portray our world -- ourselves to the world [SIGH] is with a lot of, you know, rap stars and [LAUGH] Brittany Spears [LAUGH] and Bay W- Watch --
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Not that there's anything wrong with on- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- any o- one of those individual t- [LAUGH] things [LAUGH] but, --
R:  Right, right --
L:  -- you know, if that's the --
R:  -- taken in context, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- exactly, but if that's the image everyone gets of the United States where people just spend money like it's going out of style, and [SIGH] we don't care about our kids and we have no values and, [SIGH] I mean, --
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  -- pe- -- that's what people are going to get out of it, unfortunately, ... you know?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And I think it is [SIGH] -- it is important to take this time and instead of just -- like I said instead of just looking at people and trying to blame everybody [SIGH] for their part --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in it maybe spend some time to ... to let people know that, hey, maybe we're not so bad [NOISE] afterall ... [SIGH] you know?
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I think --
R:  [NOISE]  Well --
L:  -- I think there has to be understanding on both sides.
R:  I think now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that at least in Iraq where it's, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- communication walls are down [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] that maybe the Iraqi people are getting a better idea of what America is really [NOISE] about.  Um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some obviously don't like it, the ones that are still attacking our guys [NOISE] over there but, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know if they're so deeply ingrained it's going -- it's gonna be really, really hard to change anybody's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mindset at that point.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I -- I --
R:  So, ...
L:  -- agree with you and I also think --
R:  So, ...
L:  -- I mean, a- ah, l- like you say about putting it in context --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you have to keep it in context.  Even as Americans do we all like each other and do we have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] crazy idiotic [NOISE] people that do stupid things within our own country?  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, I t- think, it [LAUGH] --
L:  You can't take the action of a handful of [SIGH] psychopaths [NOISE] [SIGH] f- for the action of an entire nation, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- y- you know.  And --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- sometimes those that have the wack- -- most wacky feelings are the ones that ... act the loudest and speak the loudest [SIGH] and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you hear the most of.  [SIGH]
