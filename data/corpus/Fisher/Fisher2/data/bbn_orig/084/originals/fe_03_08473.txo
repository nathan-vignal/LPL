R:  Hi, my name is Joan.
L:  Hello Joan, my name is David.
R:  Hi David.
L:  Hey, how're you doing?
R:  Doing good.
L:  Okay, so the topic for today is about athletes, um, did she say strikes by athletes?
R:  You know, I had difficulty with her, she said "stripes" or "strikes", but I believe it was strikes.
L:  Yeah, I think they're um, a lot of them have just been like making a big deal over like their pay checks and stuff.
R:  Correct.
L:  Yeah.  Do you watch sports at all?
R:  Ah, I watch very limited.  How about yourself?
L:  I'm not big into sports.  I watch the news a lot, which is like the only reason why I know like about like the strikes and stuff like that, like baseball players and stuff.
R:  Correct.
L:  But I'm ah, I'm not that big on sports.  I just know like some that I watch on the news, and you know like, they do make a lot of money, like to begin with.  You know what I mean?
R:  Personally, I mean, my gut feeling is that the salaries are disproportionate to other areas of interest that people have in other skills, ah, be it theatre or musicians or, you know, things of that nature.  And so I guess, I'm not terribly empa- -- empathetic to the strikes.
L:  Yeah.  Um, neither am I.  I mean like, I don't know, sports is kind of like it's -- it's good while you're in high school and stuff like that, kind of like to pass the time and things like that, but as far as them just getting paid like they're movie stars or like they're doing something to like really like help people out a lot, like --
R:  And I act- -- I actually am a -- a recreational athlete, so I -- I do enjoy sports in the sense of, you know, the involvement in it through all ages, but I just -- I just feel that probably over the years the union negotiations and things have gotten just tremendously out of control --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and when you -- and probably it's not the best comparison, but when you think of the influence say, of educators and their salaries versus looking at a sports figure and their salaries, ah, it's kind of like, yeah, cut me a break, you've got enough already. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.  I mean like I think there's persons who does like, you know, more important occupations than like you know, like shooting basketballs and stuff like that, I mean, like for me like really important occupations are like you know, doctors and you know, teachers, things like that.  People like you know, police officers, people who are actually like going to risk their lives or just you know like actually will take time out, you know, from their -- their life to just like teach other people or help other people.  With me like athletes, I've never really you know, like looked up to any of them or something or anything like that, you know.
R:  Correct.  And I've watched it, ah, with um, well the airlines would be a current example --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and watching it with the airlines right now, so many of the employees ah, and I'm not referring necessarily to the pilots, but the rank and file employees, have had to take pay cuts --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to continue, to keep things going and that's a very important part of our general economy, and even in, oh, some years past I remember there was a strike and ah, the President intervened and it was called to a halt.  So, again, I think that this is just maybe a little bit of the prima dona approach.
L:  Yeah.  I mean I think -- I don't know why like why they just like give so much like emphasis on like entertainment, because I was like to me, like sports, that's all that it is.  It's like entertainment.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  That -- that is true, and probably that's another area that in some cases has also gotten completely ah, out of whack disproportionate salaries.
L:  Yeah.  Entertainment is like -- like I said, it's -- it's nothing like crucial or like vital to like you know the United States.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Exactly.  We're going to still continue on, I mean, I love it.  I think it's great that we have it, um, but I don't necessarily ah, support that -- that the salaries keep escalating and that, ah, the method to resolve the issues is strikes.  It's kind of like "poor me".
L:  Yeah.  I mean like unfortunately like a lot of people you know, they empathize with like the sports figures, you know, they go, oh, they're on strike, you know, I don't want to see my team strike, so you know, like people just feel pressured to like you know, give the athletes like the pay that they want --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, even for just doing the same thing they've always done, you know, they're not, like I said, they're not helping anybody, they're not really like doing anything except you know like entertaining people and like I'm not sure if that's just something like the U- -- the United States like does ah, I'm not sure if like other countries have that problem but I think they could definitely like focus more on like other things, like something like officers like you know, we have like police officers like striking and then I think that would lead to like a huge problem, you know what I mean?
R:  Correct.
L:  I think -- huh?
R:  I agree with you on that.
L:  And I think that's something like the media should pay more attention to than like you know, somebody like famous or they're not going to work, I mean, it doesn't matter, it won't affect anybody, you know what I mean?  If like cops in New York City decide to like all of a sudden start striking then everybody would get affected by that, it's not just like them and their families.
R:  I guess I'm a little Pollyanna, but I don't even like to ah, think that the only way we can resolve issues is by a method of strike.
L:  Yeah.  What do you think instead of strikes like what do you think like are like some of the methods that athletes or anybody should use?
R:  Well I -- I -- I would like to think that w- -- that there could be negotiations.  Of course there are, as I realize that the unions are in negotiations --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but th- -- there could be amicable solutions reached without going to a method of ah, that's more to me like a -- a threat type issue.
L:  Hm.
R:  And I just am not real comfortable with that approach.
L:  Yeah, you think it's kind of like pushy on the part of like the athletes to be striking like that?
R:  Yes I do.  And I -- I think many times they are victims of -- of agents and victims of -- of unions.
L:  Yeah.  I think, um, a lot of people that are entertainers usually are -- it's like you know, they just get taken advantage of so much, but you know, like most people don't empathize with them because they have so much more money than any of us could ever even like dream of. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's exactly true, otherwise we probably wouldn't even be doing this survey. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exact- -- you know, exactly.  I mean it's just like they have a ridiculous amount of money and like for them to whine and cry over like money they don't really need.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  I know.
L:  You know, it's -- I don't know, you don't get a lot of like sympathy from a lot of people, you know what I mean, if you're like rich and famous and you're crying over like stuff you know, stuff like that, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's extended of course and -- and we've seen some of it with, ah, some of the CEO's companies and that type of thing but we're not using the method then of striking.  It's more a matter of saying, "Wait, this is out of proportion", or ah, business is not doing as well as it used to so we need to bring down our salaries, some to um, you know, maybe, you know, a percentage and even though the rank and file will often say, "Well my gosh", you know, ah, "They only took a hundred thousand dollar cut and we took ten".  It still may be proportionate in like a ten percent cut.
L:  Yeah.  I think it should be spread out like more evenly.  I mean, like I said, like those people getting like laid off and stuff like that and they -- you know, they have no pay, you know what I mean, like they have -- they can barely support themselves and their families and meanwhile like you know people who are doing pretty good off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know they're still like they still want more.  They want raises and stuff, I mean like I think it should definitely be like more spread out to like you know, maybe like people who are already like making good for themselves they, you know, they shouldn't get like a huge raise if there's people that have no employment or can't even, you know, support themselves.
R:  I'm with you to a degree to the necessity of the field the value and of course there is value in recreation, there is value in entertainment --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but still looking at the overall picture and what it contributes and, you know, is this really necessary?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I guess, like I'm -- I'm pretty sure it's something like would go on in like a few countries, I mean, like in third world countries I'm sure they don't have problems like this with like celebrities and sports figures and stuff like that, you know, like --
R:  No, I think we're more -- it's more just basic survival.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and so ah, you know, we're living of course, the good life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and with that comes some of the rest of those.
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's correct.  Now are we supposed to continue the dialogue for a certain period of time or until ?
L:  I think um, because this is like the third phone call that I've gotten from -- from this ah, these people --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- um, usually a machine comes on and it usually like cuts us off and then it says like oh, you know there's like thirty seconds left.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  But um --
R:  -- I didn't know how it worked because this is my first.
L:  Oh, it's your first time?  Okay.
R:  Yes.  Right.  So I -- I wa- -- I wasn't totally aware of the ah, the procedure but I thought at some point there would be, you know, something to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- give us an indication of when we had covered the topic sufficiently. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's um -- it's a machine.  It's actually set to go off after ten minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  So yeah, like the first time I was like talking and it kind of like cut me off and it, yeah, it just comes on like all of a sudden and says, you know, ten minutes are over.
R:  Oh, I got you.  Okay.
L:  And stuff like that.  Yeah.  Did you hear about this through the internet, or ?
R:  Ah, actually i- -- i- -- in the local paper in New Jersey --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I thought, well, this is rather fascinating.  I'm -- I'm not far from the University of Pennsylvania and I thought, well, this would be very fascinating and I was curious as to what some of the topics might be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I assume you've had different ones.
L:  Yeah.  The first one was about like censorship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, the other day it was about um, fitness, like physical fitness.
R:  Oh, I would have enjoyed that one, I'm sure. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah?  Are you into fitness and stuff?
R:  Oh yes.  Right, right, which has sent us back into, you know, thinking about the ah, the strikes and the sports and that type of thing, but I -- as I say, I think that as we've both pretty much come out on the same side --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of this -- the, ah -- the strike issue is -- is probably not something either of us are terribly supportive of or comfortable with.
L:  No.  I mean, I guess like I think it's kind of like senseless really, like they're already like really like filthy rich, you know what I mean, like especially like um, some here like in New York City like right across the water from Jersey --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when we had like an MTA strike, that was like a big deal.  In my opinion.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.
L:  You know, I mean that affected everybody, I mean more than like you know Kobe Bryant or you know, something like a baseball player or something like that, you know, striking.
R:  Sure, or -- or you end up with a waste management type issue and everybody [LAUGH] is the bearer of that.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  When there's a strike there, but
