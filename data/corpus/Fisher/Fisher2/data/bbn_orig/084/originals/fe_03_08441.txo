L:  Hi.
R:  H- oh, hi, it's Mark from Pittsburgh.
L:  Hi, my name is Evan from California.
R:  Oh yeah, how you doing?
L:  I'm good. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember September eleventh.  It was --
R:  Oh yeah, man.
L:  Yeah, it was very tragic.  Because they could touch a lot of people.
R:  I -- I don't -- I don't -- I don't really think I've made too many changes, I'm just more cautious, more know- you know, weary of things that could happen, you know, what I mean?
L:  Well, I haven't made more changes but, uh, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's always chance of the law[?] just coming back.  But with September eleventh though it was very -- I mean, and my lifestyle -- I mean, my lifestyle hasn't changed 'cause --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- back -- back then I was still living, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the kind of lifestyle before that but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was just making sure that at the time the terrorists or September eleventh was really -- was real tragic.  I don't there were any survivors.
R:  Yeah, it -- it, uh -- we, uh -- yeah, well I -- yeah, I don't know.  I don't even remember.  Yeah, I -- I mean, yeah, nobody immediately, I guess the people that escaped from the building.
L:  No, not [inaudible].
R:  And plus there was that cra- one of the planes crashed near here so I did leave work that day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just got up and I walked out.
L:  Well, I --
R:  I was like, "I ain't sitting in this building" 'cause I was in one of those hi- high buildings, you know.
L:  Well, okay, I was getting a job somewhere but they had to ring up and -- and I didn't get hired but ...
R:  Oh, I got laid off --
L:  September eleventh sort of cancelled my job.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah, the very same [inaudible] for twenty dollars to build a runaway you can face it, like, the Twin Towers with smoke as though something to remember seven -- September eleventh.  I just learned about that today.
R:  Yeah.  I, uh -- you know what I guess because of that too I -- I -- because I was laid off recently I think, you know, the economy really went -- really went south, you know, really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- went down after that, like, I don't know maybe that had something to do, maybe I did change my life in that way [LAUGH] you know.
L:  That's right.
R:  I'm not working so --
L:  [several inaudible words] the economy's gonna crash --
R:  -- at this point, you know.
L:  -- and it's like September eleventh that's just p- part of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I remember my mom -- my mom going to work that day, I didn't 'cause I was -- I was off that day though but malls were being targeted, amusement parks out here, Disneyland, they once had thing though, like for a while after September eleventh there were gonna be terrorists and, um,  [inaudible] like out in California all shopping malls were being targeted.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think they're trying to get New York and DC, am I right?
R:  Yeah, yeah, no doubt.  
L:  Mm.
R:  But are you -- are you near LA?  Is that where ...?
L:  I live in LA.  Well, I live in San Fernando Valley which is by LA.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's really -- also a target for -- of September eleventh.  What happened in, uh, my life --
R:  Yeah, that's where -- that's where the planes were heading when they turned 'em around, I mean, they could have easily have started at LA and head for New York and they could have turned around and crashed into something in LA.
L:  Oh yeah.  They were headed there for the White House, I think, but then they found out -- they changed their course 'cause they found out George Bush was in, um, was in another country that day.  [several inaudible words] one flew to New York State, the Twin Towers.
R:  I tell you what I wouldn't put up with any shit on airplane.  If someone was starting shit I'd be -- you know, I'd be tackling his ass, I don't care.
L:  Oh yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know what I'm saying, I wouldn't [LAUGH] -- I mean, that's a -- you know, you gotta -- you gotta look out for that.  I -- I haven't flown since then.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But I haven't -- I didn't fly a lot before that either, um, you now.
L:  I didn't flew much -- I'm not scared to fly though.
R:  I'm not either, yeah I'm --
L:  Yeah, but, I mean, [several inaudible words] things happen like that [NOISE].  I mean, I think I heard somewhere it was -- they got the -- George Bush, I think, uh, something that happened with him in -- him in Israel.
R:  What happened?
L:  I don't know what it was 'cause he was like siding with Israel for a while.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh yeah, it's very [MN], very unfortunate.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- I mean, th- you know the worst thing I saw on that was whenever the people where -- whenever they were -- they had, uh, people, like, inside -- they had cameras and stuff inside the lobby and you could hear people hitting the top of the building --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, 'cause they were jumping out the windows.
L:  Yeah, well those live broadcasters actually out on the street.  I woke up and my mom woke -- my dad woke me up first and told me that there were terrorists and my mom woke me up, like, maybe an hour later.
R:  Yeah, my -- my mom called me up and she was, like, crying, she was, like, "Get outta town" you know.
L:  Yo [LAUGH].
R:  She was all upset.  I was like -- 
L:  Then there was like --
R:  -- I went to my boss and says, "I'm leaving" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] Saddam's still in exile, Osama Bin Laden we don't know nothing --
R:  Yeah, they don't know where anybody is [LAUGH] so ...
L:  I think he was real looney tune to let, um, [several inaudible words] my freedom, um, Daniel Pearl --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].  I mean, yeah, probably September eleventh and incidents like September eleventh I probably would not -- I don't care who it is but I probably would not ignore the country like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I know, yeah.
L:  I cannot do that, you know.
R:  I never, uh, I -- one thing too like people are talking about how people are like -- you know, you see a person that looks like it might be a Muslim or, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I never -- I -- I never even -- like a lot of people were getting, like, mad at them, you know, I never --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even considered that either.  I mean, I wouldn't even --
L:  Yeah, I know a lot of people I knew [several inaudible words] just 'cause of September eleventh.
R:  Yo.
L:  I see people -- it's like a lot of people just walk away but it really never bothered me.  I mean, Muslim [inaudible] is.  But I -- 
R:  Yeah, it's just like --
L:  -- my mama's bad, she's got in an elevator and Muslims came on and she just walked out.  She apologized later --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like as time went on but it's scare -- but, I mean, it scared her or something, even in, um -- [several inaudible words] took 'em to the, uh, meals on wheels, once, uh, this one first came country when it happened.  She's not political though.
R:  Yeah.  Do you remember that day that you -- like, like I was standing outside at, uh, my girlfriend's house and, uh -- and, uh, we were standing outside and it was weird 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was like, it's the only day you heard like no airplanes in the sky at all.  Uh, you're always hearing airplanes flying over, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you didn't hear nothing.  Quiet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was like scary here, really quiet, you know.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  It was kinda -- man, that was just a weird, that was a -- I mean, that was a -- that was just a messed up day, man.
L:  Yeah.  Me and my wife took the subway out here, um, and, um, one time [inaudible] some guys and he were saying -- anyway it was sort of like a weird sign or something and she thought the plane was gonna be, uh, um, um, uh, they were, um, [inaudible] pilots and they're trying to get back at us [several inaudible words] tr- try another terrorist attack.
R:  And did you hear about -- what about that stuff, like -- yeah, where they -- where they, like -- where they knew about it or something in advance.
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  What's up with that?
L:  I don't know whether they knew anything about it -- about it, they might have, they probably did.
R:  And no one will ever know for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, maybe like -- like no one's even really sure about Kennedy yet, you know.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But Bush -- with September eleventh, uh, Bush, um, Bush, um, was, uh, out of the country and they were originally going to the White House and stuff.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  So, I don't think -- I don't think about that.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] Yeah.  Makes you wonder.
L:  And Bush didn't [inaudible] -- Bush at that time, I think, was siding with Israel, now he's against Israel.  I mean, I don't know.
R:  You don't -- yeah, you -- yeah, he flips off and all over --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the place.  It -- I don't know what he's, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and he's like -- you -- you know, he's -- he's so eager to go -- you know, go fight Iraq for whatever reason and he doesn't -- he's gon- doesn't seem to want to do anything in Liberia where all this stuff's going on.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.
L:  And changes a lot of people -- a lot of people change, me I'm just waiting for the [several inaudible words] a lot people look at September eleventh as a wake up call.
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  That's what people live here --
R:  -- no doubt, absolutely.
L:  And [several inaudible words] they don't -- they don't wanna do it, they just do it for the time then they go back to our own ways.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, September eleven that's just one of the things, it's gonna get worse too. [inaudible] September eleventh, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think one saved in the, um, Twin Towers building.
R:  No, no.
L:  All that [inaudible] would have spared their life [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, there's a -- yeah, that's -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  Yeah, they must -- they must -- I mean, people that live and work right around there they must -- I mean, I know those people hav- have changed forever, you know --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- people that live there and went through that and even seeing --
L:  Some people are --
R:  -- the video, you know, I -- I know those people have changed.
L:  Yeah, some people are scared to go on -- in -- in, like, tall buildings now.
R:  Uh, yeah, you could -- yeah, I know, you could have -- you could never go in -- that could -- it could affect your ability to -- to work and to --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- visit your doctor or whatever.
L:  And you would think [inaudible] the buildings they're so, like, um, were so strong but -- were so strong and so well protected [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, yeah, there's nothing you could do about something like that, I mean, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Except what we're doing now, you know, it -- it always takes something like this to happen before any kind of change or, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that causes all that change, you know, it may feel that -- like, all this increased security or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that -- that -- that color code system's a joke though.  I don't know, that's -- that's silly.
L:  What's the color code system?
R:  You know, where it's like an orange alert, like, terror's okay.
L:  Oh yeah [LAUGH].
R:  It's like -- it's like orange, red -- you know, red like the worst, I think, and --
L:  Out -- uh, out there has there been any, um, any, um, other alerts or something or been any other attacks or possible attacks [several inaudible words]?
R:  Are you -- are you, uh, are you on the cellphone or something or -- 'cause it sounds kinda --
L:  Oh, I'm on pay phone.
R:  Oh, all right. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, it sounds kinda -- it, uh -- I think --
L:  Don't use AT&T.
R:  I think it's just through the, uh, [NOISE] I think through the computer mak- -- uh, am I hard to hear?
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  All right.
L:  But in Pittsburgh is the target although, um -- are the targets, um, like, are there any other terrorist targets out there?
R:  No, there's nothing -- nothing that I've heard of.  I mean, you know, they could go after the stadiums ...
