L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, um, I'm Julie [LAUGH].
R:  Hi, I'm Kerry.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, yeah -- I guess a lot of changes, um, I'm unemployed [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, no -- because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because of September eleventh?
L:  Yeah, [MN] well, the economy went down --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I -- I was laid off, you know, a- after --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- like a year after, but still, yeah, the economy's just doing so bad that noone wants to really keep too many people on.
R:  Right, I know my, um, husband's, um, business was affected too, for a while, but fortunately, um, things picked up again to --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- but, [MN] yeah, he works for a family based business that does audio visual presentations, like, corporate events, you know?
L:  Right, right.
R:  He does all the --
L:  Oh, great.
R:  -- whatever -- I -- it's hard to explain, I always get stuck on it, but, um, you know, for a while everybody was reducing their costs and, you know, like you said, the economy went bad, and ah, they were kinda worried that they weren't gonna stay afloat, but fortunately things turned around just in time for them.
L:  Do they do Powerpoint presentations?
R:  Yeah, yes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, all that stuff.
L:  [inaudible] -- I was doing that for a while, but, um --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- as -- as a temp job, you know, because [SIGH] people want help, but people want it in and out, you know?
R:  Yeah, they use a lot of te- --
L:  Instead of hiring anyone full time where -- where you're gonna have to, you know, eventually provide benefits or something, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, I was a high paying temp for a while.
R:  Wow.
L:  B- before September eleventh, and then after September eleventh the business went down, so ...
R:  Oh.
L:  Naturally I wasn't getting twenty dollars an hour any more.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, um, I know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for -- for me that, ironically, it kinda -- it doesn't really -- it's not really what most people would think would be a change because of September eleventh, but, I used to be in the navy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was a recruiter at the time, for the reserves, and [MN] of course we all stayed home that day that -- you know, my boss called and said stay home.  Well, later that day I went shopping at the grocery store, and, um, I was out in the parking lot -- and I just brought my wallet in with me, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I didn't have my purse, and I put my wallet in, you know, where the kids sit in the cart --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I put my wallet there, and I was loading the groceries -- I was standing next to the car, and I was loading the groceries into my trunk -- someone ran up and grabbed my wallet [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  On September eleventh [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, it's terrible.
R:  -- stole my wallet, so, I'm more, um, security conscious.
L:  Supposedly there's a guy that's, ah --
R:  What's that?
L:  -- there -- there's a -- there's a man out in Long Island that's pick pocketing women --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- at supermarkets.
R:  Oh, where do you live?
L:  Um, no, I live in Brooklyn, but --
R:  Oh, I live in San Diego.
L:  -- you know, I heard this -- huh?
R:  I live in San Diego, in California.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, did it -- did it hurt the economy over there?
R:  Um ...
L:  I mean, I heard it affected the whole world.
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  [MN] [inaudible] --
R:  -- I -- yeah, to some degree, but I think that um, there's [MN] -- there's a lot of really affluent people here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, not that I am, I mean, we're like, middle class but, um, there's a -- I'm on the phone, I can't talk right now -- there's a lot of affluent people here and I think that they had enough money to ride it out, you know what I mean?
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, there's -- there's a lot of, um -- I think the type of businesses that are here weren't really affected.
L:  Right.
R:  As much as -- as some.
L:  As New York.
R:  Yeah.  I know our gas prices were sky high for a while --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- we were paying two twenty five a gallon.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I don't know what it was like there, but ...
L:  It -- it's bad, I mean I don't -- I don't drive, but I -- I heard it's bad -- I remember, my friend put in some gas, and I was like "That's just a quarter tank", and he paid like twenty, and, um --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- ten or twenty -- I can't remember.
R:  Well, and we're -- I live north of San Diego, about, probably about forty miles, so everything here is spread out, I mean, it's like long distances driving anywhere.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, that -- that really was -- we really felt that in our own bud- budget, I mean, just the -- the prices of gas [inaudible] --
L:  Do you have [MN] any idea if this -- the money we get from this study, if it's taxed?
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know, I don't think so.
L:  No?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-uh, you know [several inaudible words] --
L:  'Cause I received the check, and I was like, "Oh no, am I gonna get screwed over with the IRS?", you know?
R:  Well, you know why, -- no -- they -- no, um, they'd have -- they'd have to do a ten ninety nine --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and report you, and -- and I, well, I think -- you know w- w- what mystery shopping is?
L:  Um ...
R:  Do the customer service evaluations, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, like, kinda undercover -- I do that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I -- yeah, and I -- that's kinda how I got this um, Fisher job because it was posted on a board for mystery shopping, and um, that you -- you might want to think about that.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I've applied to ads in the paper, but they never call me back.
R:  No, go online -- it's all online.  [several inaudible words] There's a -- you want me to give you the website?
L:  [MN] Yeah, sure.
R:  Okay, it's called v- --
L:  I have a pen.
R:  -- it's volition -- it's V.O.L.I.T.I.O.N. --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- dot com.  Anyways, you go on there, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the like, the upper left corner on the menu, it says, "Make money", and you click on that and it gives you like an A to Z list of secret shopping companies --
L:  Oh, wow, great.
R:  -- and -- and I can -- I can go to -- I can -- I can do a secret shop for an apartment -- like, pretend I'm interested in looking at the apartment.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It takes me, like, fifteen minutes, and I get twenty five dollars.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, the only time you get taxed on that is if you make more than six hundred dollars for any one company in a year -- but, I work for, like, forty different companies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I have yet -- I have yet to reach six hundred dollars with any of them, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can -- you can kinda [inaudible] the radar that way, tax wise, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And if -- if you do make more, it's -- it's [MN] -- it's like your own small business, so you -- there's a lot of write offs -- like, you can write off, you know, your computer, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your phone line, and mileage, and all that.
L:  [NOISE] I mean, the only reason why being on the whole tax thing is good, is when you're sixty five and you're collecting social security --
R:  Right, it -- yeah --
L:  In fact --
R:  -- well, if it's still there [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When I'm sixty five [several inaudible words] --
L:  Right, if we're -- if we're all still alive [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I'm thirty nine, so --
L:  -- and we haven't bombed the hell out of each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  So, yeah, this is only my second call that I've completed, um, I did one, probably about two months ago, but everytime they call me, it's like a Saturday night and I'm not home.
L:  Oh, you could arrange the time.
R:  I know, I just kind of -- I --
L:  I arranged eleven o'clock at night, 'cause I'm always --
R:  Oh, did you?  Oh, I just forgot, and I -- and, like, I'll get home from a weekend away and there'll be a -- it'll be on my answering machine [LAUGH].
L:  Right, the weird message on the answer machine --
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- and it's like, "Oh, they called me again", so, I'm surprised I got this call tonight, but --
L:  Yeah, actually, um, right after September eleven I w- -- I was really depressed.
R:  I bet.
L:  I mean, I think most of New York was depressed, you know?
R:  Oh, god, yes.
L:  People were crying on that day --
R:  I would imagine.
L:  -- I went back to the s- -- yeah --
R:  Well, we were crying -- we were -- we were crying here too, I mean ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was the most dreadful thing.
L:  Well, ah, like, people visit the -- the site, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- men are working to build the subway station underneath --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's like, people are still crying, even --
R:  I can imagine.
L:  -- [MN] if it's like months afterwards -- I was really emotional too, you know?
R:  [MN] Well, if you think of how many people were affected --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I mean, you know, thousands of people -- people killed, and then each of those people knew hundreds of people.
L:  Right.
R:  So, the effects are really far reaching, I mean -- and then, you know, also in the Pentagon --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, there was like -- I remember reading -- there was a whole group of kids, like, eleven year olds that were going on a spelling bee or something -- either a science thing or w- -- some school related activity.
L:  Mhm.
R:  God, I mean, that just breaks my heart, 'cause I have kids and I'm thinking, "God, I can't imagine, you know, you send your kid off on this trip and that happens", you know?  I just --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- so many people were affected.  I mean, I think, you know, everyone in the country --
L:  [MN] And I've heard, like, the government knew about it -- I mean, I had a feeling they were going to come back and kick our arse, personally [SIGH] --
R:  Did you?
L:  -- you know, because they tried once before and they were -- they weren't too successful about it --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, when they [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, they only bombed the first --
R:  -- the basement.
L:  -- floor in the basement.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, like the mezzanine and the basement --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I knew they were gonna come back.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, when I saw that on TV, the d- -- morning of September eleventh I thought I had -- I turned on the Today Show before I took my kids to school and I saw the Twin Towers on fire and I thought it was like a file tape from back then, and I then I thought about it and I thought, "Well God, that was in the basement" -- right, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And then I thought, "Oh my god, this is live", and it just --
L:  And I -- and I kinda knew that it -- it had to be plane, I mean it's either a plane or a missile 'cause you can't infiltrate, well, you know, the trade towers, so you have to go by air.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know?  
R:  I mean --
L:  Like, I -- I kinda knew it was going to be like, the above ground air thing, because -- I mean, I had an interview there and I was sent home because I didn't have two pieces of ID -- even --
R:  That day?
L:  No, not that day.
R:  Oh, oh, another time?
L:  Right.  That's how high security is over there.
R:  Oh, is it?  Oh.
L:  And the company was like, "Yes, she has an interview with us" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but, you have to go home and get your -- your passport --
R:  Wow.
L:  You know?  So, I end up [MN] like, doing really poorly, obviously I didn't get the job --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and maybe I was better off, you know?
R:  Yeah, I was gonna say, maybe that was a blessing.
L:  Right.
R:  God.
L:  But I was very upset, because I made it all the way there on time, from Queens at the time --
R:  Is that a --
L:  -- then I get sent home to go all the way back down to the bottom of Manhattan, you know, for the int- -- I -- I -- I did end up going on the interview --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- you know, an hour and a half later [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But um, yeah, I mean, I -- I think a lot of people are still very depre- ...
