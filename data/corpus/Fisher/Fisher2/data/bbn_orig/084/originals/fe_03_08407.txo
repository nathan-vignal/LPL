L:  Hi, my --
R:  Rick.
L:  -- name -- oh --
R:  My name --
L:  -- I'm -- I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Ian.
R:  Ian?
L:  Yeah, what's your name?
R:  Rick.
L:  Hi.
R:  So how'd you get involved in this thing?
L:  Oh, I -- a friend recommended it to me.  How 'bout you?
R:  Uh, we- I -- I read it in the paper.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from New York City.
R:  That -- well, that's where I'm from, but I live in Seattle, Washington, now.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  And so, [SIGH] nine eleven is the subject of the day.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- okay, let me ask you a couple of questions.
L:  All right.
R:  And if they're too personal, don't answer them.
L:  Okay.
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm eighteen.
R:  You're eighteen, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm sorry?  I'm forty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- seven.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  How did nine eleven affect you?  We're both from New York City.
L:  Right, well, I mean, it was, you know, it was definitely a big deal at the time, I -- I wasn't in New York City actually, I was -- I was at boarding school in Vermont --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, so I felt, you know, I was kind of out of touch with it when it happened.
R:  You sa- okay, can I ask you another personal question?
L:  Yeah, sure.
R:  You sound like you're female.
L:  I'm -- I'm not female --
R:  Okay --
L:  -- I just have a -- 
R:  -- 'cause you gotta --
L:  -- high voice.
R:  -- a m- a male name, so I was wondering, uh [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I'm sorry, I -- you know, it happens all the time.
R:  No, that's all right, that's all right, I -- [MN] so I apologize for that indiscretion.
L:  No, it's okay.
R:  Um, uh, I'm a retired New York cop, so nine eleven affected me in the way that, uh, two of my friends died in it.
L:  Oh, wow, oh, I'm s- I'm so sorry.
R:  Um, but I guess that's not what this experiment's about, you know, it's about, I guess how people communicate.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's about linguistics, it's a- it's about the study of language and that's what this experiment's about, but if that's the subject of the day, that's where I'm at, but, the reason I retired early is 'cause I got shot in the back in a -- on a crack raid and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was it, that was the end of my career, right, and when --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my [MN] two buddies died, um, you know what you're doing when you get into that kind of line of work, you know?  [MN] Whether it's fire or police or whatever, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ye- uh, ye- there's always a risk --
L:  But this --
R:  -- so --
L:  -- was just so heavy, you know, this was much more severe, I'm sure, than --
R:  Well --
L:  -- it's, you know, it's all -- it's all really tough, I guess.
R:  What I -- I think probably the devastation of the city is what, um, hurt me the most, even though I had two -- two old buddies, I mean, I hadn't seen them in years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but they did die in th- i- i- in that fire, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, i- i- and that comes with the territory, I got shot, that comes with the territory --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all right, but the thing of it is, is that I think maybe, um, the fact that that could have happened at all in the United States brought this country -- n- not just New York, but this whole country, to an -- an awareness, you know, that, yes, it can happen here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It did happen here, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, if it did happen, it's going to happen again.
L:  So what do you -- what do you think that's changed, you know, knowing that?  What do you -- what do think that's changed in your life?
R:  Um, [SIGH] what it changed in my life, because I grew up when I was a little kid, uh, a few years with my dad in France, I lived in Europe with -- w- with my dad in France, he lived there for a long time and, um, it was interesting because when you were over there, right, in Europe?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Didn't matter what country you were in, it -- [MN] but if you had, like, a, let's say a diamond strike in South Africa, right?  It affected every union on up through Scotland, I mean, i- i- when -- i- I mean, but we're so isolated here, and I think what we found out was, um, we're not isolated any more.
L:  Yeah, that's really interesting.
R:  Ah, we're not, we're a part of the world now, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, and we're all mighty and powerful, yeah, [NOISE] [MN] I don't think so anymore, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right, I mean, we're -- we're -- our military is strong, but --
R:  Well, that's about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, but yet, uh, our intelligent President, uh, declared the end of the war after, what, four or five days and -- and now we're getting more people killed over there, but there's no war, we --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- says it --ye- you know?  Uh, [MN] so, I don't know, I don't know, but I think nine eleven changed a whole of things, is what I think.  I -- I it ju- I -- I think it changed the perception of our country and the thing that I did -- I -- I really didn't like was Rudy -- Rudy +Guiliano.  What he did was, uh, he was in the middle of a sex scandal, the middle --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of a health problem and the middle of a financial scandal and what he did was go to ball games and wear baseball caps and he was considered the greatest thing since fried rice, you know?  And I don't get that, you know?
L:  I think that -- I think that it just made so many things seem one dimensional, just --
R:  I -- I think you're right.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, I -- I do. [NOISE]
L:  Uh --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and just a lot of, like, blind patriotism --
R:  Uh, very --
L:  -- right afterward --
R:  -- blind patriotism, I was witness to, uh, almost a shootout here in -- in this small town above Seattle, just because people were waving flags and getting road rage and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, i- i- I mean it was -- it was -- it was put down by the police and fortunately there were no, you know, nothing happened, but there were people just doing some weird stuff after nine eleven --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  I saw, um, you know, lines to be -- to enlist in -- in the army just running down -- down blocks in New York City.
R:  What?
L:  Well, right a- right afterward people were just lining up to enlist.
R:  Oh, oh yeah, of course, of course.
L:  Uh, which is, I mean it's -- it's courageous, I guess, but --
R:  Well, I -- I -- there's -- there's -- there's patriotism, which is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- valid, I think, okay, and there's blind patriotism, which is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stupid --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and what we got right after nine eleven was really a blind patriotism, you know, blind.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, people were road raged, they were mad, they were mad at each other and you saw --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] I -- well, I saw more of it out here because in New York you don't have a whole lot of, you know, uh, traffic like you have out here -- uh, when -- when I say traffic I mean, literally, you know, people rely on cars out here where, you know, w- we order our food from, you know, Key Food and, you know, and [NOISE] get -- it gets delivered, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, out here people rely on everything I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- mean their cars, so everybody's waving a flag on their car, everybody's riding around with guns out here and -- ye- and I'm just -- I'm just, like, "What the hell?"
L:  Uh-huh.  Seattle, [LAUGH] you know it -- I'm sure it's much more intense in -- in Oklahoma or whatever.
R:  Yeah, yeah, um, it probably is.  It more than likely is, I -- I think that, uh, New York, uh, having grown up there and having served the public there and all that, it's still provincial in it -- in -- in its own way, I mean it's unique to itself, I mean you [MN] -- you're not going to find a New York anywhere else.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right?
L:  It's getting --
R:  But --
L:  -- less like that, I think.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think -- and even, I've noticed it since September eleventh, it just -- there's more -- [NOISE] I -- I mean, I just see it in terms of there -- there are more chain stores in New York now, there's just less --
R:  Oh yeah, oh, oh --
L:  -- less --
R:  -- oh --
L:  -- hostility --
R:  -- oh, yes --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- when I went back, uh, w- was it, uh, I think it was, uh, three years ago, that was the last time I was back there, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I saw Pizza Huts, I'm going, "Who the hell needs a Pizza Hut in New --"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- York City?  Who the hell?" -- ye- uh, uh, really?  Who needs a Subway chain store?  I mean, you've got the best delis, you got the best pizza parlors on every corner, what --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- wha- why would you need -- ye- I noticed that, too, yeah.
L:  And Disney owns Times Square now, it's just -- I -- I think that -- and I think that a lot of New Yorkers were much more willing to embrace that after September eleventh, for some reason.
R:  I don't know why that is.  I'll tell -- 'cause I'll tell you something, when I was growing up and, like I -- I'm, what, I'm better than twice your age, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  When I was growing up, I mean, the whole thing was, you know, Mario's, oh, or -- or -- or Jacob's, uh, Deli or, you know, the whole thing was you'd just walk up the block, you know -- you know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and Times Square, in fact, as a police officer Times Square was a blessing --
L:  Was it?
R:  -- before -- oh, it was, because you had probably a good seventy percent of Manhattan's crime right there --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you knew where to find it, right?
L:  Aha.
R:  -- and then when Guiliani made it into Disneyland, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, uh, i- i- well, all the -- h- well, he says he -- he took crime out of the city, bull crap, it -- you just don't know where it is anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At least you could -- you could, you know, as a policeman you -- you -- you knew where it was, right?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I -- I don't know, I -- uh, the -- it -- I -- [MN] New York, to me, when I went back four years ago, looked like a dispersal, it just looked like a [SIGH] ...
