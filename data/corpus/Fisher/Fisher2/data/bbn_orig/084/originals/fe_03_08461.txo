L:  Hello?
R:  Who's this?
L:  [SIGH] My name's Diane.
R:  Hi Diane, this is Leonard, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  So, what do you think about -- so, what kind of changes do you think September eleventh made?
L:  Well --
R:  Made on it -- on -- on -- on us?
L:  Well, I, ah, haven't pers- -- made any major changes as far as how I live my life [SIGH], although because of the bad economy for -- since nine eleven, I just got laid off from my job [SIGH], and it's certainly made -- nine eleven has certainly made, ah, traveling interesting [MN] --
R:  Well, you got --
L:  -- over the last couple of years.
R:  Yeah, you got that right.
L:  And, I've done [SIGH] a lot more traveling than [SIGH] in the past, since I am engaged to someone who lives on the opposite coast from me [LAUGH] --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- so, we've been -- I've had to visit the airport -- I've visited the airport a lot more in the last year than [SIGH] in previous years, and I've seen a lot of differences [SIGH], um, in terms of the way the security works, and, um, you know, how l- -- how much longer it takes to get through the airport.
R:  Yeah, I've been watching that and -- they're really -- they're really strict on it now.
L:  Yeah, which is good, I mean, I think they should have been stricter to begin with, but ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN] Um, course some of it I think is silly, because, like, when I [SIGH] flew shortly after that there was [SIGH], um, I had [SIGH] nail clippers with me and they took off the little nail file thing off the clippers, I thought, "Give me a break.  Now that's just plain silly" [LAUGH].
R:  They took it off?
L:  They took it off --
R:  Just for that?
L:  -- they took off the little nail file off the nail clippers.
R:  Just for that?
L:  Just for that, and I thought, "Now --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- how in the world?", 'cause I had 'em in my pocket -- I didn't even really realize I had 'em [LAUGH], um, 'til the, um, detector went off --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and -- and they said, "Well ...", you know, they -- I had to empty my pockets, and I was like, "Oh, I didn't even realize I had those with me -- they were in the pants when I put 'em on this morning ...", and um, so that was [SIGH] [MN] silly, I thought, but [SIGH] you know, I could see -- I think they need to do more in terms of what's going on behind the scenes.
R:  Yeah, I agree with you.
L:  Um, with the security, to ...
R:  I agree on that one.
L:  But, ah, have you -- has there been anything, any major changes ... that --
R:  Basically, [MN] the +security +security at the airport -- I mean, at the airport and ball parks, and everything which is a good idea --
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [PAUSE] [SIGH] Um, 'cause on --
R:  It's just -- it's just a shame that [MN] innocent people had to lose their lives because of that, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I know, I mean, it's -- it's -- it's scary that [SIGH] you know, I tried not to let it [SIGH] affect me too much, because I figure I can either live in fear and be afraid to do anything, or go anywhere, and then the terrorists have won --
R:  I hear ya.
L:  -- or, I can live my life the best way I know how.
R:  Yeah, that's the way I see it.
L:  I mean, it -- it certainly hasn't kept me from traveling, like I said, I -- I live in Atlanta and my fiance lives in Seattle --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- um, so, you know, we -- it's -- it's either [MN] -- it's either fly [MN] -- fly, or not see him 'til he moves down here [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, which wouldn't of -- wouldn't be an option [LAUGH].
R:  You'd rather fly, right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And um, well, he's moving down here in September, but still, that's um, [MN] I mean we've been -- we've been dating, well, we've been together about nine months, so ...
R:  And you met him off the computer, huh?
L:  [MN] Through a mutual friend.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Must have gone pretty good, huh?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  So, in fact I was online with -- with the mutual friend when -- when the phone rang, but I told her I'd be back in a little bit, um, but, yeah, it's, um [MN] -- a mutual friend and I know -- I knew his dad, before I met him --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- so I mean, it wasn't just like an internet dating thing --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- ah, it was through mu- -- through people we both knew, obviously [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- his dad, and he's also friends with -- his dad's friends with Pam, and so is he, so, the -- he -- his dad and [MN] my friend Pam were like, "You two should get together, you two should get together" [LAUGH].
R:  And it worked.
L:  'Cause he was gonna be down here on vacation last year, so, it was like, "Well, when he's done here on vacation, you two should go out", and I was like, "Okay, I'll go out with him", not thinking anything would come of it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, [MN] he lives on the other side of the country, well -- well, in December we're getting married, so ... [LAUGH].
R:  Really?  Cool.
L:  And he's moving down here in September.
R:  Well, that's cool.
L:  So, yeah, he, um, [MN] but at least he'll um -- the economy's good for him, 'cause he drives a truck --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so, um, [MN] at least, because so much with air freight go- going up, the cost of -- of flying things going up, then it's -- actually makes it better for him to find a job with Atlanta being a big hub for travel.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Or, for bound freight, you know, driving a truck is a pretty secure profession right now, unfortunately I'm in computers which is -- when the economy tanked[?] was one of the areas that went with it [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.
L:  So ...
R:  Yep, I just hope that [MN] we don't have [MN] any more terrorist attacks like that, I really don't -- I really don't want any more like that.
L:  [MN] I don't either -- I was -- I just -- I was stunned when it happened, and I have a friend that works in the Pentagon [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- and I was at home sick that day, from work, and I had been asleep, and I woke up and turned on the TV and there it was, and [MN] my first thought was, "Oh god, is Susan okay?" [LAUGH], and fortunately she was -- she was in the building--
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when it -- when they hit, but fortunately she's [MN] -- where she works is a different part of the building --
R:  Oh, that must have --
L:  -- than -- than there.
R:  That must have been really scary for you.
L:  It was terrifying.
R:  Oh, I'm glad she made it out okay.
L:  Yeah, and I later found out that another friend's husband was actually in the courtyard when it happened --
R:  Phew.
L:  -- which is what they were aiming for.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  Um, yeah, so it's ah, interesting, to say the least, um, [SIGH] the connections that -- that you have -- I didn't even realize that she -- that her husband was in -- was in the military --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, um, that she, um, you know, I mean, we -- he and I were talking shortly thereafter, and [MN] he said, yeah, that he was there, he says, "Yeah, I was in the courtyard, I saw the plane fly over" [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  I said, "Ew ..." [LAUGH].
R:  Yep, I turned it on, and I could not believe what was going on.
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was definitely a -- at first I thought, "No, this is ..." -- I thought I was watching -- I turned it on, I thought it was a movie, or something [MN] about the original attack, you know, the ninety three attacks -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I realized, no, this is really happening, right now [LAUGH].
R:  [MN]
L:  So, it just -- my heart stopped there for a minute, and, um, you know, like I said, it just made me I guess, a little more aware of what's going on, you know, as --
R:  You have to, now.
L:  -- being aware of -- you know, what's going on in the world --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- but yeah, again, I still -- I don't wanna let fear keep me from [SIGH] doing what -- what I wanna do [LAUGH].
R:  I hear that one.
L:  So ...
R:  Yep.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Yep, the two year anniversary coming up -- it's -- can't believe it.
L:  I know, [MN] in some ways it just doesn't seem like it's -- it's been that long --
R:  Nope.
L:  -- and then in some ways it's like, it's been -- because it's been so profound of an event, that it, [MN] you know, we've -- we've been dealing with it forever [SIGH] --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- but, it's just, you know, like I said it's -- I don't think about it, all that [SIGH] --
R:  No.
L:  -- often as a general rule, except I think about it every time I go to the airport --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- which lately, have -- like I said, has been a lot more often 'cause either he's flying here, or I'm flying there about once a month, so, I'm either picking him up at the airport, or [LAUGH] going to the airport myself --
R:  I hear that one.
L:  -- to -- to fly, about once a month and --
R:  Oh, that's  -- 
L:  -- there in the go- -- when the war was on and my parents took me down to the airport, that's when it was [MN] forever just even getting up to the terminal because they were stopping cars and searching 'em --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- so, they didn't stop us, but, you know, they were stopping cars and searching and that was -- made it even slower -- plus you have to park, well, I don't really -- I don't park now -- I don't park and leave my car at the airport, which I never did before unless I was just going somewhere overnight, ah, for a day or two, but you can't park close to the terminal any more --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- um, you have to park further away, which is [MN] silly 'cause they've always -- you know, there's no parking, no parking, no parking, and then now, because of the nine eleven they have, like, the first six rows of parking spaces blocked off where you can't use 'em 'cause they're too close to the terminal [LAUGH].
R:  Yep. 
L:  Which for, somebody like me, with a physical handicap, that makes it even that much further ...
