R:  Fi[?] Foudeen[?] but everybody call me Joshua and it's very easy.
L:  Okay.  My name is Amelia.
R:  Amelia?
L:  Yes.
R:  As in Amelia Earhart? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  As in Amelia Earhart.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.  Ah, nine eleven.  Um, was, um -- was raised up in New York so ... [SIGH] Ah, I mean, it th- -- most New Yorkers, i- it's, like, ah, watching a movie.  It happened, move on.  Ah, i- it o- o- -- i- it -- it sounds sad but th- -- I mean, that's how most New Yorkers think. [LAUGH] Unfortunately.
L:  That probably makes sense.
R:  I mean, it's not like, um -- i- it was a show a- -- for most people, you know?  But for people that's right now unemployed in New York, it's -- it's hard.  It's -- it's real hard because it's, like, almost two hundred thousand people out of work.  So, I mean, you know, it's -- it's -- it's tough.  Especially for friends and family of mine that's in New York.  So, you know, if you don't have an education m- -- and that's a problem.
L:  Yeah.  That makes sense.
R:  I mean, wh- where are you, ah -- ah, you know, from?  Like, you know ...
L:  Um, I'm from Rhode Island.  Right now, I live in Kentucky.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I wasn't, um -- I wasn't really affected by September eleventh that much.  I didn't know anyone who lives or works in New York and none of my family or friends live and work in New York.  So, I can't say it really [NOISE] -- I mean, life, it's pretty much the same now, you know, as it was then.  I can't say it's really been any different, um, for me and my family.  It just didn't really affect us that much other than just, you know, maybe a small loss of security.  Um, realizing that, like, attacks could happen in the United States.  But other than that, I would say life is pretty much the same as it was before.
R:  I mean, um, I -- you know, when they say, like, three thousand people perished in the, um -- in -- in -- in the World Trade Center, to me, that is, kind of, um, a real untrue statement because about that time, there's more than three thousand people in the Twin Towers at that time.  I mean, it's more than that.  So, it was, kinda, a stun to me t- -- for someone to say, "Well, it was three thousand people" and -- and at that given time it's more than three thousand people in the World Trade Center in -- at that moment of time.  So, it was, like, ah, you know, I -- I don't know if it was a miscount or [LAUGH] -- or someone just -- just said if it was more than three thousand --
L:  Well, not everyone who was in the World Trade Center died.  A lot of people got out and --
R:  R- --
L:  -- got away.
R:  Yeah.  Um, that's true but that, ah -- it's, like, um -- um, Rudy actually asked for eleven thousand body bags.  I mean, this is before the count was even +taken.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm, like, "Where did he get that number from?" [LAUGH] You know, it just -- you know, it's just -- to me, it's, kinda, you know -- kind of a strange thing for someone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to say, "Well, this is what we need" and you don't -- you don't have a body count yet.  I mean, that -- to me, I -- I -- ah, Rudy, ah, he, you know, is, kinda -- with me, kinda, shakiest[?] little bit. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  He's a business man in, you know -- in New York and thank god that he was a businessman 'cause they could've been, um, in a lotta worse shape than what they were.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, ah, for him, he was a businessman so, I mean, the -- the mayor that they have now n- -- is -- he's a good guy.  You know?  He's a good guy.  And, um, New York -- I've been in New York for a visit and things have gotten, s- somewhat, back to normal but if anybody hear a pop or a plane going [LAUGH] overhead, you see people, you know --
L:  I- --
R:  -- nerves come a little tattered or people look up or -- i- it gets a little paranoia [LAUGH] at times so ... [LAUGH] You know?  I- -- you know, that's New York, you know?  And -- and you are -- you -- you in Kentucky now and that -- I -- [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's a l- long way from Rhode Island.
L:  Yeah.  Well, Kentucky's a nice place.
R:  Right.
L:  It's a good place to live.
R:  I mean, do they -- do they still -- do they call you a Yank? [LAUGH] You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, no.  Not -- not really where I live.  Most people don't even particularly care where I'm from.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  In -- in the more rural parts, yeah, people will call me a Yankee but not -- I live in the city so I don't really, you know ...  And where I live, it's actually more Mid Western than Southern.  It's a, you know, more of a Mid Western place than a Southern place.
R:  [NOISE] Uh ah.  M- m- --
L:  [NOISE] But it's a good place to live.
R:  [LAUGH] It's a good place to live?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I -- I -- you know, I -- my family's from Georgia so, you know, that's -- you know, I mean, it's -- it's -- it's -- it's better than the inner city any -- any day.  I mean, the city -- I mean, just y- -- like, I live in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia now.  It's, like, I -- I -- I'm just getting sick of, you know, people crawling all over each other.  I mean, it's, like, ah -- ah, what they call a rural rat race.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  So, where you are, Kentucky, n- -- which is good.  Which is very good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I mean -- I mean, do you miss Rhode Island any?
L:  Um, yeah, I do.  My family's up there so I miss my family.  I miss the -- the weather in the summer where the summers are just gorgeous in Rhode Island with, you know -- in the seventies and the eighties and low +humidity -- low humidity and breezes and stuff.  But summers in Kentucky are rather hot and humid and suffocating.
R:  Well, you sound like you, um -- um, at -- at -- in college?  I tend to go --
L:  No.  I'm graduated from college.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yep.  I'm married, I have a -- a daughter.
R:  You sound so young. [LAUGH] You sound like you --
L:  I -- I sound younger than I am.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Every- -- ah, everyone says that I do. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, and do -- do people would like, "Oh, man" [LAUGH] you know?  When they talking to you, you give 'em your -- your -- your age and, you know -- and the particulars, they, like, "Mm, sound like a phony to me". [LAUGH] Do they harass you about it?
L:  No.
R:  A- --
L:  I mean, not -- not really but I mean, I do -- I do sound younger than I am.
R:  Right.  Which is good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Which is good, you know?  'Cause then, you know, e- e- -- I -- people think them -- ah, the way I speak, sometimes they say, "Is this --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- is a girl or a guy?  I don't know which g- -- ah, which is s- speaking to".  So, I let 'em guess, [LAUGH] right?
L:  [LAUGH] I bet that's fun.
R:  Yes.  It's funny.  You know what I mean?  'Cause I have guys that say, "Ma'am" and then I have guys that say, ye- -- ah, women that say a man too and then it gets real confusing 'til I tell 'em, "I'm a guy" you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [LAUGH] -- so, I guess, you know, I -- I, you know, i- it's just, um, ah, b- -- I guess a l- -- a lifestyle.  That's -- that's what it comes down to.
L:  Yeah.  Probably.
R:  You know what I mean?  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I e- -- I -- I tell people it's, like, you know, "If you take care of yourself to some great degree, you'll be all right".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You'll be all right.  I mean, you sound as young as me and you do.  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I try and be healthy so ...
R:  Right.  I mean, because when -- when I heard this thing on the radio, I said, "Now, this is real -- this is really nice".  I mean -- y- you know what I mean?  Just to see how it -- it is.  You know what I mean?  How --
L:  Yeah.
R:  How se- -- how different views are.  And you get to, um, meet different people and -- and -- and actually, for once in -- for once in -- in -- in my life, ah, you know, it -- I get to get the honest truth of what people honestly thing.  You know what I'm saying? [LAUGH] I -- I get -- really get, you know, w- -- you know, what they really, honestly think and -- which is good.
L:  Yeah.  No one's trying to impress anyone else or, you know, you're never gonna see the other person so you don't really care what they think so you can just, you know, tell the truth.
R:  That's it.  You know?  So, um, our -- our president is over in Africa and, um, [LIPSMACK] he said something that really, I think, shook the world somewhat when he said, well, e- -- you know, "When I was going over -- when I was, um -- the state of the union and the information that I got was false".  Oh, my god.  I almost, like, you know, l- lost all consciousness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But he's -- he's a honest guy he just -- d- -- he just down to earth --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- honest person.  And -- and they -- and they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trying to -- trying to make him out of a political, you know -- you know, um, guy that, you know, cuts his words and plays games but he just told the truth.  And it's, like, +taken a lot of people by shock that he would say that and they'd be, like -- well, I say, he's -- at least he's telling the truth, for god's sake.  You can't blame the man for that. [LAUGH] But I don't know how many heads are gonna roll [LAUGH] because of that, you know?  But I think the world is, like, in shock right now that he honestly said that.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, weapons of mass destruction and then you say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- always, you know, that's -- it was for false information.  It's, like -- so I say, at least he's -- least he's telling truth.  I -- you know?
L:  A lot of people are gonna say he's just trying to cover himself up --
R:  What? [LAUGH]
L:  -- when he didn't find anything and that's what a lot of people are gonna -- are just gonna say, "Oh, he just said that".  Or, "He's coming out and saying that now because they didn't find anything".
R:  Right.
L:  Um, that's what -- that's what a lotta people -- a lotta people are going to -- to think.  Me?  I don't really -- I don't really know what to think about him.  He's not my -- he's not my favorite president, um, at all.  I -- I think he's -- he's all right.  He does a -- a good enough job considering the circumstances that, you know, our country were in but I guess he's down to earth and honest enough but -- I don't know.  I think he's also, a little bit too, um, a- --
