R:  Schumacher.
L:  Hi, I'm Kim Presney.
R:  Hi, my name's Jeff.
L:  Hi Jeff.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  I am fine, and what was -- the topic was about professional athlete's salaries?
R:  Yeah, well they have been striking recently, like, professional hockey, to get more money.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So.  Do you know anything about that?
L:  Not the hockey.  I remember, like, you know, the baseball one.  I didn't even know that hockey was really striking.
R:  Oh, they didn't strike but, like --
L:  But they're talking about it, huh?
R:  -- yeah, they called the union out.
L:  Oh, okay.  Ah, you know, I guess you have to be really good to ah, make it to the professional status, but I think their salaries are kind of outrageous at the moment, some of them.
R:  I don't know, I think they get what they deserve.  A lot of people like hockey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know, so 
L:  Yeah, hockey or football and, you know, basketball players, I mean I -- I -- I enjoy watching all of it, so I enjoy, you know, but I mean, in retrospect, like to what the President or somebody else makes, they make so much more.
R:  Yeah.  Well also, they're striking against the managers, more or less, besides high ticket prices.  Managers make more than they do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I'm really not that opposed to the striking.  But I'm opposed to unionizing altogether.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Just because, I don't know, unless working conditions are bad, I don't think unions should be able to go.
L:  This is true. I believe that also.  But I guess when, I don't know, but ah, when did they -- when were they talking about striking?
R:  Ah, I just remember hockey had talks about a year ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I believe.  I don't really follow it that much.  I just remember seeing something on Sports Center.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I remember, wasn't it football a while ago, or ?
R:  Ah, baseball --
L:  Baseball.
L:  -- had a strike in ninety six, that like, ended half the season, that was the last major one.  Baseball's about the only one that strikes.  NBA had a lockout, which is like, they basically stopped negotiations until whenever, or they stopped playing until negotiations continued.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I couldn't hear what they were saying about, I could hear for sports figures but that was about it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  It wasn't real clear.  Have you done a lot of these calls?
R:  Ah, no, this is my first one actually.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's like when they call it's usually not a very convenient time.  I did one, ah, I guess the last study a couple of months ago, and it was kind of interesting.  So I don't know what you're supposed to say for, what, eight minutes? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I guess if you don't know much about unionization and sports it makes it kind of difficult.
L:  Are they talking about unionizing all the ah, sports or ?
R:  No, not unionization but that's like what striking is basically --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they have a player's union already --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and just if they don't feel like it.  It's mainly minimum salaries that they ah, gripe about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not like the salaries you hear on TV of the main star players [inaudible] cheaper professional athletes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're supposedly very good.
L:  The guys that are just starting out basically, huh?
R:  Yeah.  They have like a lot of -- a lot of training and they don't feel like they're getting enough money for how much they put into it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So then they like, organize and everyone strikes.
L:  And they do make a lot of money for the owners and for everybody else --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- the way the ticket prices just keep going up, I guess, and you look in retrospect about how much you pay for a ticket to get into anything.
R:  Yeah, but people pay anyway.  I don't know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely a commodity.
L:  I know I paid like, four hundred and some dollars for some tickets one time to the Bulls game, and I thought it was well worth my money.  Everybody else told me I was nuts, but I had a good time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Are you from Chicago?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Detroit originally, I live here now.  I live in Evanston.
L:  Oh, in Evanston, oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So do you go to North West- -- Western games and stuff?
R:  Ah, well sometimes.  They're really bad.
L:  Really? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  We just drove by there the other day and I was like, "Oh, I'd like to go to one of their games." [LAUGH] 
R:  Football, they're horrendous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Basketball, they're all right.  But, I don't know, [inaudible] fan.
L:  It's like they go back and forth kind of, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it'll be a while before we see anything with the Bulls again.
R:  I doubt it.  I don't like the Bulls. [LAUGH] 
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  I never really have.
L:  What are you, a Cubs -- a Cub or a Sox fan?
R:  Ah, I like the Cubs a little bit better.
L:  Yeah, me too.  And we always got to hope for the Bears.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I don't --
L:  Their prices are really going up, and with the licensing fees and stuff for their -- for the seats are outrageous.
R:  Where's the new stadium, do you know?
L:  Where is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's right were the old one was.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's built around it.  They actually kept some.  I was down there the other day and looked at it, it's beautiful.  It's -- it's big.  They kept the columns and everything, because I guess that's what they were trying to get the landmark status for it, so ah, they didn't demolish any of that so that's still there.  So it's like, you know, right on the other side of ah, the Museum of Science and Industry there.
R:  Oh, so it's on the south side?
L:  Well it's on, ah, Lake Shore Drive.  Okay? 
R:  Okay.
L:  You know where, ah, like, ah, you can see it like, when we were at Taste of Chicago down in -- we saw it.
R:  Okay, I only ride [inaudible] so [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  What -- what else [inaudible] is it off of?
L:  Ah, let's see.  It -- it'd be down a little bit, 'cause we usually take the blue line and we get off at Jackson --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then you can kind of -- then ah, you know, that's where we go to Taste of Chicago from and from Taste of Chicago you can see it.
R:  Okay.
L:  So.  That's where I -- plus we went to a bunch of games.  It's more, ah, do you know where Roosevelt Road is?
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  No.  Okay, well it's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- basically over there.  It's not real far, I mean, it's -- it's before McCormick Place.
R:  Is that -- is that the shopping center, McCormick Place?
L:  No, McCormick Place is ah, the great big convention center and everything.
R:  Oh, okay.  So it's sort of around the loop?
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  It's like, ah, a little bit south of the loop.
R:  Oh okay, that's not that far.
L:  Yeah, it's, I mean, you can walk there from the loop.  We've done it before.  But the stadium's going to be beautiful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At least there'll be maybe restroom space for everybody.  The last time you'd go there and there was like, you'd just stand in line for [LAUGH] who knows?  Half -- half the quarter trying to wait to go to the bathroom.
R:  Oh.  I actually met the guy who did the roofing.
L:  Oh yeah?  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  He came in and spoke to one of our classes.  It was kind of interesting.
L:  Hm.  Going to North -- ah, do you go to North Western, or ?
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  Oh great.
R:  It was like a material science class and he came in and talked about the materials used to roof solar[?] field.
L:  Oh.  Cool.  Yeah, it was a lot of work.  I can say it looks like it's almost done, I can't wait to -- hopefully I can afford a ticket to get in.
R:  Oh, yeah, the Lion's games are pretty expensive and they're horrendous.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] They're ah -- they're ah, not doing too well. [LAUGH] 
R:  No.
L:  But the Pistons did do good this year, didn't they?
R:  Yeah, they should be really good next year.  They got a high draft pick.
L:  Well that's good at least.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  How long have you been in Chicago?
R:  Ah, I'm going to be a sophomore next year, so I've lived here since my [inaudible]
L:  Oh, well that's not bad.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, we were just in Evanston the other day.  I was shopping in a little store, so I got some ah, gift certificates off ebay.  And ah, there was a bunch for different Evanston stores over there if you're like into biking or anything like that, you pay -- and they're paying like a dollar piece for the gift certificates and ah, they're twenty five dollar gift certificates so I had like, and I had one for a jewelry store for fifty and -- so I went and spent like, two hundred dollars on stuff that I -- well I got two hundred dollars worth of stuff for like, five dollars.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  I know, it was great, so I -- I just did the little Evanston thing the other day.  Just drove around and found all these different little places.
R:  Where -- where did you go?
L:  Ah, I went to ah, the Castle -- Castle coffee and I went to the Pony bike shop and then we went to a Swingback[?] bike shop, but it was closed.  And then I went to ah, a jewelry store.  But it was kind of fun when you can go buy all this stuff and you didn't really spend any money on it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  That must be down by Howard.
L:  Ah, it was on -- some of it was on, ah, Central, I think.  Was it Central?
R:  Okay, that's really fun north.
L:  Yeah.  Central and then one was on Ch -- ah, a couple were on Chicago.
R:  Okay.
L:  And then one was on Dempster.  Dempster and Chicago I think it was.
R:  I have been down to Dempster's.  That's where jewelry is.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, I don't know, I haven't like, heard of any of those places.  So [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, like I said, when you get twenty five dollars worth for a dollar, it's like, you'll -- you'll figure where they are, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well that's -- god, it seems like we've been on the telephone for a while now.  You'd think that the ten minutes would be up.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I haven't really be timing, so 
L:  Yeah, neither have I.  I'm sitting here on the computer and trying to take care of my grandson too, so it's like -- I just got -- I do mystery shopping too.  I just got a thing from
