R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, my name is Darla.
L:  Can you hang on one second?
R:  Sure.
L:  Okay. [PAUSE] [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi.
R:  What is your name?
L:  Brian.
R:  Brian.
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  Yes, hello.  Um, we are to talk about any changes that we've made in our lives since September the eleventh.
L:  Okay.  The changes that I made is to be more secure about myself and the environment around me and be more cautious, you know, uh, of talking to strangers and [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, just, you know, it's a big change, you know, 'cause you don't know, you know, who's out there today and you really have to be careful who you, you know, get acquainted with.
R:  Right, what are some of the things that you've done to be more secure?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  A- aside from just not talking to strangers.
L:  Well, um, you know, when I go somewhere, um, making sure my doors are locked and, um, I just -- just so much, you know, with my family and my kids, you know, it's like we -- we're a lot closer now, you know, talking and it's -- it's -- it's made more of a bond for me and my family.
R:  Mm.  Well, that's good.  That's a -- that's good outcome --
L:  And, um --
R:  -- actually.
L:  [MN]
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Well, for myself, I have, um, I guess [MN] in a way too it -- it -- uh, family has become more important to me and, um, what I'm doing with my life, I've made some big changes in my professional life, um, I think that, you know, being happier with yourself and with the things that you're doing is, uh, is not a bad thing, [LAUGH] you know, and I just -- it just really brought home the fact to me that one never knows.  I feel more insecure, I feel like our country is, you know --
L:  Oh, I do too, I feel insecure 'cause, you know, 'cause so much, you know, comes across the border, even with, you know, the pets now, you know, they discussed last week on the news talking about pets, you know, bringing diseases into this country and this little girl, it had on the news where, you know, she had this pet and she got this, you know, disease from it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she could have died.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And, uh, and now she's got a dog. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They give her a dog, plus a horse.
R:  Well, yeah, well, that's good thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah I --
L:  But, you know, I have friends, you know, that's up in Canada and uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, and, um, [LIPSMACK] they talk about a lot of the, you know, terrorists up in that area and, uh, with al Qaeda cells and talk about all the diseases they have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, with the Niro Virus and mad cow disease and Sars disease --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, it's -- it's just -- I'm just thankful I'm here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I'm not up in, you know, them other countries where all this violence and stuff going on.
R:  But that's the point I was trying to make, I -- I feel, um, that we are not as, um, I feel more insecure, [MN] our country is more, um, insecure, we always sort of had a -- at least I did, I thought, well, nothing can touch us, you know, we're --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, but [MN] we're vulnerable, highly vulnerable --
L:  Yes, we are.
R:  -- and more --
L:  -- and still are.
R:  -- yeah, more so than -- than I would have thought.
L:  I know even my dad quit ordering prescriptions, you know, from other countries --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he -- he gets them here in the United States now.
R:  Ah, how 'bout that -- that's a --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that's a change.
L:  -- I mean that [MN] really changed him since the nine eleven with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just in medicine.
R:  Have you -- have you, um, flown anywhere since then?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, I haven't. [LAUGH]
R:  I haven't either.
L:  Um, I just go about two hundred miles and back home, I go to my little condo on the beach --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, down in South Carolina and I come back home. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, tha- tha- I've been doing pretty much the same thing, travel by car, mostly.
L:  That's what I do.
R:  And, uh, really don't have a desire to jump in an airplane any too soon.
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  No, well, I was never very comfortable flyer anyway, but now I'm even -- I know I'll be even more nervous when I do get in a plane.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  I -- I don't know, I've just, um, I guess like you, I keep my doors locked in my car when I'm driving, which I never did before.  Um, very --
L:  I mean, as a male, I mean, that might sound unusual, but, you know, you never know --
R:  No --
L:  -- I mean --
R:  -- you don't.
L:  -- I've heard of this, you know, person and their family went to a supermarket and they -- they come out with the groceries here in, uh, Georgia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and next thing they know they were kidnapped and they wasn't released to they got to Illinois.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh dear.
L:  So, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ever since that, you know, happened right down the road from my house, but, you know, everywhere I go now, you know, my doors are locked.
R:  Sure.
L:  I don't care what time of day it is, it ain't just got anything to do with the darkness at night, I --
R:  E-
L:  -- mean, it --
R:  -- exactly.
L:  It's, you know, all times of the day, you know, I look in the back seat before I even get in the car. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Hm.
R:  I -- I -- we keep our doors locked, too and, uh --
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- you know.
L:  But I ha- went as far as, you know, get a gun or nothing like that, you know, for protection here at home, you know, I see a lot of stuff on the news telling it, you know, people should, you know, a lot of people, with this, you know, these different gun shows and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have on TV --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, telling people that, you know, it may be wise to get them a gun, but I just -- I don't know, there's something about guns I just never liked.
R:  No, I don't either, I really, I don't -- I'm -- I'm a p- proponent of gun control and I -- I just -- I don't want a gun in my house.
L:  If anything, I would probably update the security in my house with, you know, a new system or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the -- well, where they can, uh, contact the law officials and they can get here a lot quicker --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, if I'd done anything else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but right now, just being very -- very, very precautious, you know, in the environment and the people around me and coming in and out of my home, when I get home from work and it has put a lot of change on me, it really has --
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  -- you know, and I even, [LIPSMACK] you know, thought about all the victims, you know, that -- that died and, you know, it's a lot of -- a lot of caring in my heart, you know, I -- I drew up a lot of drafts here on stuff, you know, ways to -- to redo the -- the Twin Towers and presented them, but they -- they still went with another thing, but, yeah, it just -- I cared a lot about all them people, you know, that --
R:  Yeah, it's a darned shame, too --
L:  It is.
R:  -- many people died needlessly and then their families, it affected so many people.
L:  And something else, you know, it brought me a lot closer to God, it's like I read the Bible more and --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- go to church more and, you know, got a bond with God a lot closer.
R:  Hm.  Mhm.
L:  You know, spiritually, it -- it affected me and my kids.
R:  Huh, that's an interesting -- I didn't have that same response.
L:  Oh really?
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  Well, it's just seeing all the people, you know, and the victims with bringing their -- their flowers and gifts to the memorials --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and -- and -- and, uh, seeing all that had happened it just brought me a lot closer to God and -- and listening to these new country songs they come out with, you know, and, um, [NOISE] how it changed, you know, the -- the environment, it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just brought me a lot closer to God --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- spiritually.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that's interesting, that's nice for you.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's m- probably much more comforting.
L:  Oh, it is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know that, [SIGH] you know, God's my protector, I don't -- I don't need no weapon to protect me and --
R:  [NOISE] That's a good --
L:  -- when my time comes, it's -- it's going to come, you know, nobody can change that.
R:  Huh.
L:  Hm.
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I don't know if the people in the towers felt that way. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know --
L:  Oh, they hating a lot of people, they bought a lot of hatred. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, and a lot of the first response was revenge and, you know, [NOISE] and, you know, I think one of the biggest reasons why we -- we struck back and I think, you know, like, me and my dad and all talk about it that we just stirred up more trouble --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then we get over there in North Korea and that's going to never end, you know, and -- and there are still killings every day, there's soldiers dying over there now, even though the war --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, we have pulled away from that country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's still people getting killed.
R:  Yes.  And I'm afraid it's going to continue.
L:  [LIPSMACK] It is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Mm, well, let's see, what other things have I done or would do -- or have done differently?  I -- I -- I guess just like you, being a little more cautious, um, I pretty much stick to home and, like you, have a little place at the beach, I go to and back home again, go ...
