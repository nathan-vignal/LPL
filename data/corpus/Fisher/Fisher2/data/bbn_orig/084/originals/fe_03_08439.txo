R:  Hello, my name is Mateus[?].
L:  Yes, hi, my name is Margaret.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Okay.  And how you doing today?
R:  Oh, pretty good.
L:  Yeah, the topic is very serious, right?
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I called yesterday and it was fitness.
L:  Ah, I see.  Well, September the eleventh I remember this day as it was, like, you know, a couple of days ago because I worked for a city assistance program and we had a conference on census day --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- it was really -- yeah, it was September the eleventh and, uh, it started at nine o'clock at the University of Penn, in at Penn actually.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, people came from all Pennsylvania and -- no, I believe from United States because it was like a national --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, conference on --
R:  Right, also that plane fell in Pennsylvania, right, or is that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that was just -- yeah [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  And, you know, when it happened actually no one knew what happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because people started to call each other, they didn't have, uh, direct TVs there and everybody started to talk, uh, what they heard from --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some phone call, from someone came later and they saw on TV something, well it was, you know, unbelievable it was.
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'm from, uh, from -- from -- sorry, I'm from New York City actually.
L:  Ah, you are from New York.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where do you live in New York?
R:  What's that?
L:  Where do you live in New York?
R:  Uh, right now in West Midtown.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  But I wasn't in New York at the time I was out in college.
L:  I see.
R:  So, it was just horrible 'cause I woke up one morning and I went to class and by this time it was, uh, ten or eleven, I don't -- I can't remember --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but don't know anything about it and I get to class and everybody in class is talking about going to war and, like, all these things and I have no idea what's going on so I asked the person next to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  "What -- what's going on, why are we talking about war?" and they just said that the -- the Twin Towers had fallen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I immediately started calling my mom, 'cause she lives here, you know.
L:  Uh-huh, she lives in New York?
R:  Yeah, and I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and all my friends do too.
L:  And was it -- was it really difficult to make a phone -- uh, a phone call to New York?
R:  I -- I couldn't get in touch with anybody.
L:  Yes, yes, because everybody --
R:  I couldn't get in touch with anybody, it was horrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my mom actually saw the whole thing happen.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  She was with my -- with her aunt, my great aunt --
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  -- from Argentina --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause my family is from Argentina.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she came to visit and they were by -- by the river but on the Upper West Side --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so they were far away from the towers but you can --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- see them clearly.  And all of a sudden my mom starts seeing, like, smoke coming out of one of them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's like -- and she actually got -- got mad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause sh- she thought they were polluting [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my mom's very environmentally friendly.
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  So, she was, like, "Oh my god, I can't believe they're polluting so much from the --" 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- World Trade Center" and then --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- she saw the second plane hit and she was like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- "Oh my god" and everybody started watching it it was, from what she said, pretty intense.
L:  And people saw it on TV just like it was in, uh, some horrible movie.
R:  I know, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  The only thing I can con- confer[?] with this horrible thing is, um, you know, my family they are originally from former Soviet Union actually --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Ukraine in Russia and then when Chernobyl happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I don't know if you know about this, uh -- you know --
R:  Right, no, of course, of course.
L:  -- this nuclear explosion.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  And then [several inaudible words] that time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the only thing I can compare Chernobyl to what happened to the World Trade Center.
R:  Right.  But Chernobyl was an accident, right, or ...?
L:  Well, it wasn't -- yeah, it was an accident but, you know, it was devastating --
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  -- definitely for, you know --
R:  Like for the --
L:  -- again -- again, you know, like, this event affected a lot of people, Chernobyl affected a lot of people.
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's how I can compare it and, you know, like -- oh, you know, [NOISE] the question was today how we affected -- the place I work was affected, my job was hundred percent affected --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because, you know, people stopped coming, United St- States stopped accepting people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you have just a few refugees now in the program.
R:  Right.
L:  So, the, uh -- you know, like, hundred, uh, percent we were affected at work and, you know, I think that the whole life in Unit- United States change after this.
R:  Definitely.
L:  People started to think differently, well --
R:  Especially in New York, everybody got nice, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Well, in, uh, Philadelphia -- I'm from Philadelphia --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the same thing what -- first of all you love New York and, you know, I remember those --
R:  Right.
L:  -- those beautiful places.
R:  Right.
L:  A lot of people, the best people worked there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, when I talk about it I'm just feeling like, you know, it's awful, awful --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how human beings can do -- could do such a thing.
R:  Right.
L:  It's just, you know, it's very, very [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Well, after Chernobyl did everybody have a sense of solidarity with one another?
L:  Had what?
R:  Kind of what happened here?  Was there a solidarity between people?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  Or was it more, like, you know what I mean?
L:  You know [MN] -- well, in Russia it was difficu- different than there.  First of all people did not know about that.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Because the -- you know, it was the hidden and, uh --
R:  Right. [MN]
L:  -- people started to hear rumors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was not like here, everything, uh, became known right away.
R:  Right.
L:  It was different.  And the -- first of all, you know, like in a couple of days people started to talk because some people knew from, uh, the, you know, government institutions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from the scientific institutes -- my husband's work on the plant and then you would try to wait --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so people started to leave, uh, cities and towns --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the area.  I was among those people because he was not that much affected.  Actually we were -- I would say, you know, like it most likely because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the wind blew different directions.
R:  Right, right, right, yeah, right.
L:  But people started to leave Ukraine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and by the way we -- me and my family we left -- we went to -- for Moscow and it was not easy to leave.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was like during the wartime.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was impossible to take any kind of, uh, transportation.
R:  Right.
L:  And one of my relatives she, um, uh, was staying [NOISE] in an airport the whole night until she got --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ticket and we flew to Moscow.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And actually we were away from the city, like, for four months and, uh, I let the children longer and, um, very, very soon after that we -- we left, uh, it was that time Soviet Union so we came here.
R:  Right.
L:  And the -- it was, you know, still -- I remember the day it was, um, April twenty six in eighty six.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I still remember the day it was awful.
R:  Yeah, I remember it was eight six.  I didn't know the exact day but -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, and, again, like, with September eleventh you could not be able to, mm, to contact your relatives in New York --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the say happened -- the same ha- happened he- here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I have friends in Canada and here no one, uh, no one could call.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it was awful.  And, again, like some, uh, countries of Europe also were affected.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The whole -- you know, it affected [NOISE] the whole world and they think it can be compared to September the eleventh because, I think, it also affected, oh, everyone.  Everybody, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Definitely.
L:  Of course New Yorkers and of course Americans but listen how England -- Great Britain reacted -- how --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think all decent and honest people cannot, uh, respond differently.
R:  No, definitely.  I mean --
L:  It's -- you know, it's, um --
R:  -- the war in Iraq too, like --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- that's supposedly linked to Al Qaeda, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  Th- that apparently is not true anymore.  Like it lead to that --
L:  Well, it's so difficult, you know, to -- to know what is better and what is worse.  The only thing it's a shame that this Bin Laden is still somewhere working it out.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Well, and, you know, when the -- you know, when now we see the pictures of those horrible men --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unbelievable how they were able to hid somewhere --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, in beautiful European countries.  Listen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they attended good colleges and everything.  How could such educated persons do such a horrible --
R:  Such horrible things.
L:  -- thing to people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To, you know, no- to civilians.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not military.  Well, Iraq is at least a war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's, you know, just people who went to work from the- their home, you know, it's -- oh, it's awful.
R:  Yeah, I know it is.
L:  It's really, really --
R:  So, what -- what do you think of --
L:  It's still --
R:  -- Putin, do you like -- do you like him?
L:  Huh?
R:  The -- the Russian President, Putin.
L:  Ah, Putin.
R:  Putin, yeah.
L:  Putin, Vladimir Putin.  
R:  Putin.
L:  Well, he -- he's better than some other, uh, presidents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When we were back there, uh, still with Gorbachev and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so he was -- again, he was more democratic than the rest.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Putin also I like him more than some other people but he -- he has, um, he's terrorist too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because Chechnya --
R:  Well, he's doing the whole thing in Chechnya now, right?
L:  -- Chechnya, oh yeah, they, uh, they [inaudible] you know, this kind of terrorist --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like who came from -- who did this horrible thing in, uh, New York --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're similar because [MN] they are very, very hot people and, uh, they've never happy with their lives, they want -- they're independent but I personal don't belief that the independence will do some good to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in general, you know, when it Soviet Union it was some -- how easier for the people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the economy and industry --
R:  Right, it was all tied.
L:  -- but well people -- everyone want independence and that's okay.  No, Putin is -- uh, I like him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He's seems to be more democratic and he, uh, he's in good relationship with the West and, no --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think he's all right and, uh, I like very much when the United States and Russia in good relationship.  I think, you know --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- both are great nations and, uh, there are lot of good things in Russia, just like it was, uh, very popular movie[?] in Russia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- back there when I was a student [LIPSMACK] and they said that Russia was not liked with the Tzars, with presidents and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because in general it's also like America, it's a beautiful country with beautiful, um, you know [NOISE] --
R:  Right, it's huge, lots of natural --
L:  Yeah, lots of --
R:  -- resources.
L:  -- landscape, beautiful cities, history.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It -- it's beautiful.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Poetry, music, you know -- 
R:  Yeah, literature is great, yeah.
L:  -- but well -- yeah, but, you know, again, it's a very, very difficult past --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, back there and it's not ...
