L:  Rose.
R:  Hello.  My name's --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- Barry.  How are you?
L:  Hi Barry.  I'm --
R:  A- --
L:  -- fine.
R:  Well, okay.  Well [NOISE] -- well, what actually happened after September eleventh, you know, I probably came a little bit more, um, what would you say ... careful and when you, you know -- when you go out and you don't stay out later than you, you know -- you usually do.
L:  Right.  Where --
R:  And, um, you're more conscious on, you know, things that -- that happen and you're probably, ah -- I would say, in my opinion, you'd probably watch the news more and -- especially when the war started, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That probably doesn't help things at all because that's when -- least you can -- you know, well, that's when the terrorist sometimes strike too.  So far, they haven't been around but, where I live, ah, they have certain precautions.  They have -- you know, if there's a, um, attack -- like, if there's, um, [PAUSE] biological and this and that and they have facilities for it since, you know -- since it's happened.  Whether they had anything like that before, I really -- I don't think so. [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.
R:  So, that makes it more it more of a -- aware of, you know, things that happened and everything.  You know, when --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from a --
L:  Um, where are you located at?
R:  I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.  I'm in f- -- um, Clearwater, Florida.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was really nervous because the -- it -- the head of it all when the war started was MacDill.  And I'm just right across the bridge from there and I thought, "If anything happens, you know, that's gonna --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- be the target.  It's gonna be somewhere around here".
R:  Well, you have the, ah, facilities all around there.  Or close by is the, ah -- the test flights unit.  They go to, you know, different places in -- in the atmosphere, you know, where they have testing planes and, I guess, a lot of other things that go on [LAUGH] -- on down where you're at and yet, where -- where I'm at, they have, um, a lot of different types of bridges and spans and, you know, i- in -- around Pittsburgh, Allegheny County there's, probably about ten or fifteen +bridges -- different types of bridges --
L:  Really?
R:  -- that they have to, ah -- well, th- they probably patrol them and if it -- just like they do it in -- well, if you remember in -- there was a scare, ah -- there was a few of 'em in San Francisco.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
R:  You know, where their bridges are there so they -- they watch it, you know -- different areas probably a lot better than they ever did before.  As far as the other thing that they set up was, um, the former governor of the state, the task f- -- whatever they call it -- force thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if that makes a difference or not.
L:  You know, I don't --
R:  Because --
L:  I don't know either.
R:  -- they -- th- -- it doesn't seem like -- i- in order to have a force like that, you have to have 'em all over in every state, I think.  And I don't they really do.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  I don't think so either.
R:  And that's [LAUGH] where -- it's -- it's really, you know, not i- i- -- to me, it's not really feasible but they -- they w- -- you know, th- they like him and I guess they think he's doing a f- -- j- -- a good enough of a job or otherwise, they wouldn't have him doing it I guess.  As far as --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Um ... [PAUSE]
L:  But you know, you never hear anything about, like, well, for instance, Florida.  I don't really hear anything.  I mean, they showed that, um -- the workers at the power plant are having, um, disputes with their contracts, so they showed the security guards there and they're carrying machine guns.  Now, it's not -- if that's --
R:  W- --
L:  -- something that they did before, I kinda doubt.
R:  Well, th- then you have to.  And j- -- especially the airports now and everything since they have 'em on planes.  They -- they have all kinds of different things.  And yet, they show on the TV and different ads if -- you know, where they find all different kinds of things on people.  And whether they actually arrest them, you know, for misdemeanors so you never find that out either.
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  And they increase securities in a lot of the airports and different places but yet, um, [MN] was it two or three months ago they were saying on TV that the travel, you know, like to, um -- well, your end, down in Florida --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, um, Orlando, Florida where, ah, Disney -- them places out there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that place and in California and all them are r- -- their businesses are really off.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  They're -- it's -- they're giving all the Florida residents huge discounts so somebody will come in and keep 'em open.
R:  Well, y- y- -- if you don't do that ...  And then they have different things on the -- where, ah, they have a special thing for flights, I think, during the summer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And well, [inaudible] always has deals.  The Greyhound has a thing for, ah -- was it, like, fifteen dollars?  I don't know if it was that and for -- to one way or two ways, you know, where they have -- where you can go so far.
L:  Have you taken advantage of any of the travel deals?
R:  No, I don't [LAUGH] -- I find v- -- unfortunately, I don't have any kids. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't know if you do or not.
L:  Well, um --
R:  If you have kids that a- --
L:  My roommate and I, um, our kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- live in another state and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I tell you, we've traveled together a lot more than we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ever have.  We just back fourth of July weekend.  We went to Southern --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Florida just for the weekend because it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- such a huge deal.
R:  Did you fly or did you ...?
L:  No.  We drove but we still got a -- a package deal with, um, you know, dinner and hotel package.  Where it was a really good deal.
R:  M- -- yeah.  Well, that is, you know -- far as that part [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- i- if anything, it probably -- it has to, um -- it's over -- it's gonna be two years soon since --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that incident.  A lotta [NOISE] people don't realize that and some people that, you know -- that I know that have traveled to different places they don't really -- really worry about it.  You know, they pay the fee for the, ah, whatever they call it -- the insurance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If something happens, you know -- you know, they figure it happens.  But, again, these people are probably more my age.  I'm probably a little bit older than you are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll be sixty in November so that makes a big difference, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- as far as -- when I used to travel, we used to go up to -- when my kids were younger, we used to go to, ah, Coney I- -- and we went -- I've been down to, you know, Virginia Beach and all those, you know, parks down through there, which are -- I think, are probably some of the best in the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if you've ever been to any but I forget the names of them offhand but ...  The one park they have where you go in to, ah -- to look ar- -- [NOISE] [PAUSE] to look around, you have, um -- you're not allowed to e- -- I forget what ... you're not allowed to eat anything in the park, you're not allowed to take any f- food or drinks or anything.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And they have, um, I believe, areas that are, like -- well, you know, they say they're designated.
L:  Oh, picnic areas?
R:  Where you eat and th- -- right.  And you're not allowed to carry, you know, food around with you and you're not allowed to eat.  And it probably keeps the park a- a- as beauti- -- you know, as beautiful as it is.
L:  Right.
R:  And naturally, [LAUGH] when you go to eat in the f- foods in the places, they're not cheap anymore.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  Well, we went down --
L:  No.  It costs a fortune.
R:  -- about twelve or fourteen yea- -- well, thirteen years ago.  In the mid eighties.  For the time, it's, ah -- well, it's alm- -- yeah, it's longer than that but [NOISE] ...
L:  It still costs a small fortune just to have dinner.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the same thing as when you -- when you go aw- -- you know, when you went away for the weekend for the fourth.  Well, the only thing is, some places have what they call, um -- a- -- I used to call 'em like +smorgasbords, where you go through and they have all the food --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you just take what you want, you know?  Like, there's roast beef and there's spaghetti and there's chicken and there's a little bit of everything.
L:  Right.
R:  See, now those deals we had when we were down there, are really wonderful.
L:  Oh, yes.  And they're hard to find now.
R:  If you have, you know, like, two of -- it w- -- it was two adults and a child and I think it was -- of course, this is -- again, like I said, it was in eighty one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or eighty two.  It was quite a years ago and, ah, I think, for the three of us it was, like, thirty dollars or twenty eight dollars.
L:  Wow.
R:  You know?  Pr- -- it's full of the same but if you're [inaudible] --
L:  W- --
R:  Not a sh- -- well -- well, they have different wordings of it.  The fare's t- -- and they have all the food, you know, and then you just t- take what you want and you're allowed to -- for one price, you're allowed to eat as much as you want.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know if you've eaten peach cobbler pie?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Where you -- from down -- where you're at too and down South they don't -- they make it really super, I think.
L:  You know, I haven't had it -- I -- I'm from Ohio.  I've been down here about six, seven years but, um, I've not had it down here.
R:  You say you have a r- -- you have a roommate?  Are you still in college?
L:  No.  Well, I -- I'm in college online.  I have a disability with my back.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  So, kind of. [LAUGH] I mean, I'm a little too old for college but that's the only thing I can do.  So, I'm gonna take it as far as I can.
R:  In other words, you're gonna go as far as your what?  PhD?  Are -- are you referring to?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If I can.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know if there's a PhD in accounting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, um, I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm sure that --
R:  Probably.
L:  -- I'll go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as far as my masters.
R:  [NOISE] Y- -- ho- -- you mean a [NOISE] ho- -- [NOISE] may I ask you what your -- masters I think they go up to if I'm right.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  I --
L:  I'd like to do that and then if, um --
R:  Actually, my -- my wife -- well, that's another -- we're getting off the subject a little -- my wife, ah, [NOISE] she has [NOISE] her masters when she was [PAUSE] fifty three. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Yeah.  Hers is in [NOISE] psychology and working with kids. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's a good field.
R:  Sort of in the --
