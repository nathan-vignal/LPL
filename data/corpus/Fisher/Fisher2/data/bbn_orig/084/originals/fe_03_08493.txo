L:  Hello?
R:  Hi. [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  My name -- I'm good, how are you?
R:  I'm doing great.
L:  Good.  My name is Jonna, and I'm in Colorado.
R:  My name is Jill, and I'm in Utah.
L:  Oh -- neighbors.
R:  Yeah, close by.
L:  Yep.  I'll be with you in about ten minutes [NOISE].  Anyway, I'm sorry. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's fine.
L:  Trying to get the trash out.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I guess our -- our, um, t- topic is strikes by sports teams, or sport -- sporting people, I guess.
R:  Yes.
L:  Correct?  [NOISE] 
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Huh, well, I feel like it's a ridiculous thing to even -- for them to even consider, but ... um ...
R:  Well, they make more than anybody else, reasonably, and they're always unhappy with something.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right, and they're just, um, they're such prima donnas -- they think they deserve everything.
R:  True.
L:  And, um, [MN] I -- especially with baseball, [NOISE] I just think, you know, "Yeah, you guys play in the heat of the day, and you do this and you do that, but what about the construction workers on the street who are dying in this heat too, who make, you know, [SIGH] not even [SIGH] a fifth -- well, not even a fiftieth of what they make, really".
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  And, [NOISE] they don't necessarily have the opportunity to ... to strike, [NOISE] and yes, I believe most athletes make way too much money.
R:  Well, I guess a lot boils down to unions, somewhat, and I'm not a big fan of unions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no matter what industry they're in -- I don't think that --
L:  Oh, it --
R:  -- they don't lead to [inaudible] competition for anybody, I don't believe.
L:  I agree, one hundred percent, I -- [SIGH] my grandfather was always big into the whole union thing, and I -- he could never make me understand why it was a good thing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, even his, ah, arguments, [SIGH] being a union man his whole life, it's like "Mm, still not getting it".
R:  Maybe in the older -- older times, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they really -- well, there weren't fair labor practices, but nowadays, I think that unions -- they're not necessary.
L:  [NOISE] They're outdated, definitely.
R:  But -- yeah.
L:  And it just does- -- you know, makes people think they d- deserve more than what they get, and in some cases I think that's true -- in other cases I think people get way too much.
R:  Right.  [PAUSE] 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  We have ourselves a really hard topic for ten minutes, I have to say.
L:  [LAUGH] It -- it really is.
R:  [LAUGH] Compared to some of 'em I've had.
L:  Yeah, I've had a few really interesting ones, but this one's kinda tough.  You know, and I'm a big sports fan -- my son is going to the Junior Olympics with his --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, hockey team this summer, so [SIGH] [NOISE], you know, I understand that, yeah, it's an expensive sport to be in, from my point of view, but I also know that, ah, most professional athletes get [NOISE] all of their equipment on sponsorship, and ah, get paid by these people who are sponsoring them, not only to wear their stuff, but then, you know, even more they get paid [MN] on a percentage fee -- it's ridiculous.
R:  Right.  So would you feel if your son became a professional athlete?
L:  Um, [SIGH] I would still feel like he was probably pretty much a p- [LAUGH] prima donna.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] I, you know, and he's one of those kids who plays and loves the sport because he plays and loves the sport -- it's not an avenue for him.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, he's just good at it because, he loves it.  Where, I hear so many parents, just dogging their kids about, "This is your future, and this is where we're gonna go, and ...", it's like, "What -- what are you talking about?", [LAUGH] you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Isn't education more important, and, you know, aren't you looking at what he's doing in school", and -- and most parents aren't -- they're looking at, you know, "Oh well, how many days of school is he going to have to miss for this", and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, "Are the teachers going to give me a hard time?", and a lot of people -- I home school my kids -- a lot of people think that's why, it makes it a whole lot more convenient for me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, my kids also don't miss a day of school because of it.
R:  And yeah, so they're always there.
L:  Right, and you know, if we have to work into [NOISE] the middle of the summer, as we have this year, that's what we have to do. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, they -- they know it's a two way street -- I've not given up on one, [NOISE] for the other.  But, ah, so many parents treat as such a [NOISE], you know, it's -- it's their career from the time they're little little, [NOISE] 'til they've left home, or whatever.
R:  Well, maybe parents use it as kind of a way out for themselves financially as well.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, probably -- you're probably right.  [SIGH] Yeah, this -- this striking situation -- I don't understand at all how a -- a union for people who make multimillion dollars [SIGH] can work the way it does, so that they can just walk out on ah, their fan base, and [SIGH]-- the fans don't get reimbursed for the time they're on strike.
R:  Right.  I mean, how unfair could the labor practices really be for these poor multibillionaires?
L:  Exactly, [LAUGH] yeah, poor guys.
R:  I shouldn't say that, but, you know, I mean, they -- they're all just [inaudible] -- they don't realize what other people really do all day.
L:  [SIGH] No, they have no idea, and, you know, I [SIGH] -- I look at teachers as a comparison, in that, you know, a teacher [NOISE] also has, usually, a good long break somewhere within a year --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they do have a union that's there to, supposedly, help them with the situation, that they feel they're not being treated fairly, but, when it comes down to it, the union's never there for 'em ... you know, when they wanna strike as teachers, "Oh well, you know, we're just being over [SIGH] -- over zealous with this, [NOISE] and we should negotiate further" -- well, where, you know, the multi millionaires, "I wanna strike", and they're done --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Everybody says, "Well, okay".  [SIGH] 
R:  Well, I guess I have no pity for any of the professional athletes --
L:  No.
R:  If -- if I could trade jobs with them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even for a few months, you know, most of them have not had real jobs when you hear interviews with 'em -- this is the only thing they've ever done.
L:  Right.  And if they have, it's been like, you know, a pool boy, or something [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, where they don't really get it, even with that [NOISE].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, so -- and especially I think, like the big -- [NOISE] the big three sports -- the football, basketball and -- and, ah, baseball, you know, not only do they have [SIGH] the exorbitant salaries that they have, they also have free education.
R:  True.
L:  Free everything -- free this, free that, to the point that, you know, they aren't even, to start out with, in debt, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it just doesn't make sense that they want so much more than what they already get.
R:  Seems like a pretty good life to me, honestly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And yet, I understand they go on the road and what not, and it probably makes it difficult to have a family life, but I don't think that's really a priority for many of them anyway.
L:  [SIGH] No, and you know, so many people, including myself -- my husband travels [NOISE] about seventy percent of the time.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, you know, he's not union, he doesn't make [NOISE] a fraction of what these people make.  He loves his job, and we make do.  We do what we do -- what we've gotta do, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we don't have anyone to go whine to [LAUGH].
R:  I don't think --
L:  You know?
R:  -- we'd ever get any work done.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  So, I just -- I don't get the whole union thing with -- with sports at all, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think we're pretty much in agreement -- 'cause I don't know anybody who agrees with sports teams going on strike.
R:  I'm not aware of anybody either, other than maybe the agents.
L:  [SIGH] Maybe the agents, and -- and the athletes themselves, but, I -- I fail to see any fans that are really taken back by it.
R:  Right, I mean, the problem we have is even when they do strike, the fans come back, so the athletes don't learn anything -- they don't learn it isn't okay.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] And then, you know, like in the case of, ah, one of athletes here in Denver, you know, "Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do -- I don't know what I'm gonna do -- I get injured too much, people are too on my case", ah, then they offer him a mill- -- eleven million dollars for one year.  Well [LAUGH], you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- let's complain about that for a minute, you know, I mean, if I could whine and say, "Oh, I can't do my housework" [LAUGH].
R:  You can try it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I can try it, my husband will say, "Well, you know, I can find someone else".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Not much of a leg to stand on here.
R:  No, no, no.  [NOISE]
L:  I guess they're sort of the royalty of our time.
R:  They are, and I know as fans we make 'em into that, unfortunately.
L:  Yeah, that is the unfortunate part.
R:  I mean, we basically have nobody to blame but ourselves, for how things are right now with the exorbitant salaries.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, exactly, exactly, and, um, I used to have season Bronco tickets, I used to have season Nugget tickets -- my husband holds season Rockies tickets, right now, and I'm really against that -- I just think that that's -- like you said ...
