R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  [NOISE]
L:  Hi!  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi!  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I guess we're supposed to talk --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- now, huh?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I guess so.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, what do you know --
R:  My name's Paula.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay, I'm Laura.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, what changes have I made --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- since September Eleventh?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] gosh some of the first things that just came to my mind is, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just the ... v- value that I put on my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] my immediate family.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how protective I am of my children.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  They are some of the main things.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]  U- u- um, --
L:  -- how about yourself?  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I haven't really made any changes.  [NOISE]  I mean I -- I've [SIGH] [NOISE] just kind of instilled in my kids [NOISE] what to do if something happens, you know, [NOISE] and, um, [NOISE] you know, meeting places and stuff when we go [NOISE] p- places, you know, if something happens [NOISE] what do you do, [NOISE] where do you go?  [NOISE]  [SIGH] You know, stuff like that but [MN] [NOISE] I haven't made any, like, [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] I don't -- I'm not going to let them s- scare me.  [NOISE]  I'm still gonna go to sporting events.  I'm still gonna go to, you know, [NOISE] things I want to go to.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  I'm still gonna live my life.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, how many children do you have?
R:  [SIGH]  Four.  [NOISE]
L:  Four.  Okay.
R:  [COUGH]  I have four boys.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Four boys.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I've just got two girls and they're really little and so I -- they aren't even really aware of what [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- happened.  My -- my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- second, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- child was only a week old --
R:  [NOISE]  Okay, --
L:  -- [SIGH] when that happened --
R:  -- so they don't really --
L:  -- and so, --
R:  know what's going on.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, that was kind of a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] a [SIGH] [LAUGH] -- a big thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for us to have to have a brand new baby right when that happened.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's kind of, like, you know, "What kind of a world are we bringing our kids i- [LAUGH] into?" [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] kind of feeling.  But, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] yeah, as far as, u- um, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] preparations for a disaster and things like that, we really haven't made a whole lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of c- changes and things we --
R:  Well, my kids were all --
L:  -- still feel pretty secure --
R:  -- [NOISE] -- [SIGH] mine --
L:  -- [SIGH] as we are.
R:  -- were all aware of it, you know, and seeing it going on and stuff so [SIGH] kind of have to, [NOISE] you know, make them be [NOISE] peaceful about it and not, --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, worry and [NOISE] [MN] [SIGH] try not to show any fear in front of them, you know.  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  But ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] well we -- we haven't even really had to deal with, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, any questions about what's happened or not but, --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] um,
R:  [SIGH]  It's changed my view on the war and stuff.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I'm more for the war.  [SIGH]  I think we need to go get them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd rather go down fighting then [SIGH] [NOISE] sit here and wait for someone to come get us again.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I definitely feel the same way about that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's the other -- that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one of the changes that I've made --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is that I feel like that -- that it's more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- necessary to [LIPSMACK] --
R:  With four boys --
L:  -- [SIGH] to do --
R:  -- I've never thought --
L:  -- something.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- be for a war but ... [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you have to do it or they're gonna [NOISE] come get us again.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  And if they do come at least we could say well, [NOISE] you know, we tried.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I -- I definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- feel more secure about it now though that we're --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- we're, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- taking some action against them, though.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  So, ...
R:  I think if we [NOISE] took -- if we would have took action before [SIGH] it might not have happened.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  We kind of --
L:  I don't know.  I -- I haven't, ah, --
R:  -- put our guard down.  I don't know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I haven't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really changed a whole lot in the way that I do things but it's definitely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- changed, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of the -- the innocence --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we had, [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] as far as, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't know, just feeling a little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] maybe a little too secure and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] [SIGH] --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- and things.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, ... [LIPSMACK] and I have a -- a brother in law --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's out ... in, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the war right now.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, it's kind of, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [PAUSE] [SIGH] yeah, one of those things that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's pretty close to home.
R:  [NOISE]  We don't have a choice, I mean, [NOISE] you know, see people against the war.  I -- I -- that would be me before but [NOISE] you don't have a choice, -- I mean, and now they're out there you got [NOISE] to stand up for everybody who's [NOISE] out there.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That's about the only changes I made.  I mean it [NOISE] changed my perspective on a lot of things.  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yep.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  But, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  Well, I -- I -- I don't know, I definitely, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I've felt more of a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I mean I've always been a really, really patriotic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- person just because, you know, I've had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- f- family that have been in the military.  My dad was in the military and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fought in the Korean war, and things like that.  But, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] u- um, just since this has happened I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I've, ah, had a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- m- much stronger desire to show --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my support of ... our country --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and what I believe in as far as --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] our government and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- our freedoms --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and our rights --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] to live the way we want to live.
R:  Yeah, definitely we have to fight for freedom.  It's just not gonna come easy any more.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I don't want to be like those other countries where you can't even walk down the street without, you know, --
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] suicide bombers and stuff.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  [MN]  It's scary but [SIGH] ...  [NOISE]  Mainly I'm just trying to get my kids into, you know, [NOISE] ... not being afraid and "Go on with your life" and [NOISE] ... we, you know, have a lot of faith and it's, like, "Y- you know, [NOISE] trust in God whatever's gonna happen, you know, H- He's gonna protect you".  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's where we are too.  It's [SIGH] -- that's -- it's hard to, ah, [SIGH] explain to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- children.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've got, you know my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my niece -- I've got my sister --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who's h- husband is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- over in the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] in the m- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- war right now.  She has five ... children and, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's been difficult for her to try to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- e- explain to them why, -- you know, how God would let that happen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- t- take her --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- their dad and things like that but, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we -- we do have very strong faith too.  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] that's one of the things that [PAUSE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just been, ah, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] ... lots of prayer.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yep.  Yep.
L:  S- [LAUGH] so, [SIGH] --
R:  And that's the [NOISE] --
L:  -- on his behalf.
R:  -- that's the thing with my kids, too.  It's, like, "W- w- w- why did God let this happen?  [NOISE]  If, you know, God's here why did he let all those people [NOISE] die?" and [SIGH] it's "One of these t- things happen and He has to let it happen for a reason".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean there is a lot of people [NOISE] who ... got down on their knees and started praying after all that, you know, and [NOISE] [MN] it opens a lot of people's eyes up.  [NOISE]  [MN]  Got to be ready [NOISE] no matter what.  [NOISE]  So, I don't know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  It's hard to explain to kids, but [NOISE] [SIGH] that's my biggest thing.  [NOISE]  I mean I don't really -- haven't made any change f- for me and I'm not really worried about myself but [NOISE] [SIGH] you worry about your k- kids.  [SIGH]  And [NOISE] --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- if this is happening now [NOISE] what's going to happen when they're, -- you know, they're older.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, [SIGH] it's -- yeah, I tried to be a little bit more informed too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just, ah, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- follow up on what's going on and, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, as my kids get older --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're gonna need to understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of things that [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that are going on right now.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know
R:  [NOISE]  I mean there's stuff I don't even understand so it's, like, [LAUGH] --
L:  I k- [LAUGH] know.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "How do I explain it to you?"  [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  I just started to keep the, you know, TV off as much as I could when that was happening.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  They were on CNN all day, every day, you know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Oh, that's really good.  Well, our +daughter -- our oldest was about two [SIGH] at the time and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] we didn't think that she was really old enough to [SIGH] --
R:  Understand it, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, to understand and, y- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the morning that it happened my mom and I, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, she was visiting 'cause I'd just had my baby and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] we went in and turned the TV on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and our -- our daughter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- watched it but after that she would just, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] um, just had these strange --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- little episodes of being afraid for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- absolutely no reason, --
R:  Oh, really?  [NOISE]
L:  -- just would freak out over things and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  I wouldn't think they would know that little.  [NOISE]
L:  -- talked to her doctor about it and they were like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "Well, yeah, that can --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- that's the way that a toddler --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- p- probably s- show --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- that they've been --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- really affected by it" and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] we tried not to let her see too much of it but that morning it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] one of those things, initially, we just didn't --
R:  You can't turn the TV off then, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Well, my kids were at school so ...
L:  So, ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So, did they get a lot of exposure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about what happened at school or ...?
R:  [NOISE]  They did, yeah, [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which I don't think they -- the -- especially in the high school.  The high school had the TVs on, [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, probably all day.
R:  -- which I don't think was a good idea, [NOISE] ... you know, but [NOISE] ... the ones in grade school didn't really ... [NOISE] [SIGH] get to see too much but [NOISE] ... the one in high school [NOISE] he said the TVs were on everywhere he went.  They were watching it.  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE]  But I -- I myself had to turn off.  [NOISE]  I mean I was, like, obsessed with MSNBC.  [NOISE]  I was just watching it constantly.  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, when the kids were in the room to see what was going on [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it was just affecting me so much it was like I -- I [NOISE] [SIGH] couldn't watch it any more.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That's where we got too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It just got to the point where I was making myself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sick w- [LAUGH] watching that.
R:  Yeah, I knew everybody's names --
L:  I turned it off.
R:  -- and everybody who had, you know, [NOISE] -- who worked here and who did this [NOISE] and who, -- you know, it was j- just too much.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Too much.  It affected me too much.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  But ... [SIGH] [NOISE] I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Do you know how long we're supposed t- to talk for this?
R:  It's supposed to be ten minutes.  Have you done [NOISE] ... a survey before?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I haven't.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, you haven't.  [NOISE]
L:  This is my first, so ...
R:  [SIGH]  I actually did only two and one time the lady ... got disconnected and I was [NOISE] talking to myself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I was, [NOISE] "Okay, here I am [NOISE] by myself [NOISE] on the phone talking to myself".  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, well, I don't know, we -- we've kind of put a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] a little s- scrap book, box type, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, memento thing together.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so that our kids can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go back look at, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- you know, we have the -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] articles that have come out later about the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- certain heros and things that have --
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, did --
L:  -- come, --
R:  you?
L:  -- you know, the stories that have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- arisen since --
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's happened and things, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to try to, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, help them to understand what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what kind of people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what kind of people sacrificed their --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- their lives to --
R:  [NOISE]  Right.  Right.
L:  -- help other people and things --
R:  And still are --
L:  -- like that to --
R:  -- out there every day doing it.  [NOISE]
L:  T- those people that had really good values and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] [MN] total strangers but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] helped out and [SIGH] --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] that kind of thing.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But  ...  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I don't know how long ten minutes is but I think it clicks off when it's done.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  O- okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  And then usually -- you can make a comment at the end [NOISE] if you want or something [NOISE] [SIGH] but ...  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  I don't know but ... all of my boys are [NOISE] -- [SIGH] I have one son who's old enough to go to military [NOISE] so it was kind of scary when it --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- was happening.  You know, like, "Oh, no!"  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  That would be scary.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I know somebody's got to go but ...  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  And I -- and I have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a -- a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have two ... brothers in law that are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the milit- --
