L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name's Eric.
R:  Um, I'm Lois.
L:  Hi Lois.
R:  I didn't catch what the topic was.  I just heard September eleventh.  Did you --
L:  Oh, they just want to know what, kind of, changes, you know, that, ah, you may have made in your life, ah, as far as, you know, ah, everyday --
R:  Oh, okay.  I --
L:  You know, kind of, a thing.  Um, where are you calling from?
R:  Um, I live [MN] twenty minutes from New York.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, well, I've made a change after that [LAUGH] 'cause I work at LaGuardia.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So, um, [LIPSMACK] the minute they offered us a f- -- we -- after it happened, they let us stay out of work for a week --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause there was no passengers flying.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, when the voluntary furlough came up, I decided to change my career 'cause I was, kind of, nervous about working at the airport.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, I took a furlough for four months.  I got a job that paid twice as much.
L:  Hm.
R:  And, um, I ended up leaving my -- the job and I went back to the airlines.
L:  Okay.
R:  Because I'm stupid. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No.  So, that's --
R:  No.  I like my job.  Yeah.
L:  That hits home.  Jeeze.  'Cause you are -- so where were you, ah, when everything happened?
R:  Oh, it was crazy.  I was -- had just finished boarding a flight.  It was a really easy day and I was working at a gate with my best girlfriend, which really worked out for the two of us.
L:  Hm.
R:  'Cause, um, sh- -- we -- she got a phone call and one of my c- -- girlfriends called us and said, "The airport's closed.  You know, why are you guys still there?"
L:  Huh.
R:  And I turned around to my manager and I said, "Listen, the airport's closed.  They just said they're gonna bomb the airport".
L:  Mm.
R:  And my manager said, "Oh, girls, don't get nervous.  Go up and rebook all the passengers".  You know, like, she was just taking it like it was nothing.  She never closed the airport.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, um, my girlfriend and I took our placard books [LAUGH] and she said, "We're outta here". [LAUGH] A- --
L:  Wow.
R:  So, we were lucky 'cause we got the last bus, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] the employee bus back to the parking lot.  After that, my friends were stuck there twelve, thirteen hours.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  You know, they couldn't get home 'cause all the highways had closed.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, I was really lucky.  She said, you know, "Leave your car there and we'll stick together and we'll come back and get your car tomorrow".  I didn't get my car for a week later.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But, you know, that was no big, you know, deal.  I was just glad to get home.
L:  Now, did you, um -- now, did you know anyone who was involved with the attacks or, like, just outside of family and friends or anything?
R:  Ah, yeah.  It was a nightmare.  Um, actually, my ol- -- I had a supervisor that worked for the airlines and him -- is -- his wife is a good friend of mine and he decided to quit the airlines and he went to work for Canter Fitzgerald.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  So, that was really a -- a nightmare.
L:  Oh.
R:  She had three little kids --
L:  Oh.  Terrible.
R:  -- and she  -- it was awful.  And then I knew an- -- one of the s- -- one of the FBI agents that ran into the building.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think it was actually the only FBI agent that was killed.
L:  My word.
R:  And I knew somebody's brother but mainly my girlfriend's husband was the one that really was the worst.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause it was just a- -- he had a brother that worked for Canter so it was -- that -- they both got killed.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And the funeral was just m- -- ah, just horrible.
L:  Oh, god.
R:  But, ah, it was a -- n- not a fun day.
L:  No.  It was -- it was terrible.
R:  And you saw all the smoke.  You know, when you were leaving the airport, you could see all the smoke.
L:  Huh.
R:  Right in front of us.  It was -- you know, it was weird.  And you could s- -- we -- I went down to where it was -- where it happened --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that weekend --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and y- you could smell it so bad in --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- your system.
L:  Oh, my word.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Ah, New Jersey, outside of Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How come you don't have a Philly accent? [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, because we speak well here in South Jersey.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Right.
L:  We're not, like, "Hey, yous guys" kind of a thing.
R:  Well ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what -- did you make any changes in your life?
L:  Um, yeah.  I, um -- well, just in traveling I think.  You know, you just -- I'm not afraid to travel at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In fact, I'm a professional musician so, um --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  We -- in fact, ah, that day, we were recording in Woodstock, New York, um, about an hour and a half away.
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah, we were recording there and, you know, we just came down and, you know, we had a house that we were staying in -- we were up there for about three weeks -doing a couple a songs with the producer and we come down -- I came downstairs from taking a shower -- I was the last one -- and I remember seeing my, um -- my drummer, ah, having coffee and he's, like, "Dude, you're not gonna believe what's happening".
R:  Wow.
L:  You know?  And I turned and I saw the television and we just, kinda, were glued there.  Now, [SIGH] you know, your -- your record company's paying about two thousand dollars a day for you to work there, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we, um -- we decided to go into work.  You know, I mean, none of us wanted to but we had to --
R:  Wow.  What's the name of your band?
L:  Ah, we're called Grey Eye Glances.
R:  Oh.  Wow.
L:  And, ah, we started working, um, and we had to record this one song and it was just the hardest day to try to be creative, you know?
R:  I know.
L:  And -- and singing and do music and stuff with this on your mind.  I mean, you know, we all -- you know, I had a cousin who worked in -- in -- in the building, but he got out.  You know, it was --
R:  Thank god.
L:  -- one of those, kind of a, things but it's just -- you know, exactly.  It's one of those things where it was hours before you got word, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and so, just -- so many -- your mind was on so many different things.  And so, to this day, um, you know, that song made it on the album and it's just -- it's really, kinda, creepy.  Sometimes, when we play it in concert and stuff, it still just --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, puts a chill up my spine.
R:  What's the name of your album?  I'll go buy it.
L:  It's called A Little Voodoo.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's called Grey Eye Glances.
R:  Okay.
L:  I- -- it's G.R.E.Y. -- we're on the web.  Grey Eye Glances dot com.
R:  Grey Eye Dancers?
L:  Grey Eye --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  E.Y.E.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then Glances, as in looking.
R:  Oh, glances. [LAUGH] I'm sorry.
L:  Glances.  Glan- --
R:  Glance- -- G.L.A.N.C. --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- E.S. dot com?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm gonna look it up when I get off.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, it was a song called Good Folks and, um, just even it -- even the -- th- the lyrics were just hauntingly prophetic.  I mean, it was just a --
R:  Wow.
L:  It was really, really an odd thing.  So, every time, you know -- as I said before -- [LAUGH] we're playing it in concert, it's just, ah [MN] -- sometimes it just puts your hair up on your neck, you know?
R:  Yeah.  'Cause you think about it.
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes it never does --
R:  I had, um --
L:  -- and then -- but -- yeah.
R:  -- just boarded a flight and I was [LAUGH] -- the -- my flight just left to go to Charlotte and then, all of a sudden, w- -- I s- -- I go to the bar and -- where they -- we have a little bar by the gate and I see all these passengers just freaking out looking at the TV.  And I thought it was a little plane.  And then I went downstairs 'cause some lady told me, "Can you get my bag back?"  I said, "Sure".  So, I went downstairs to get her bag and one of the guys I work with is, like, "No, it was American Airlines".  So, I went down to my -- next flight was f- -- was an Orlando flight and I told the flight [LAUGH] attendants, you know, get your f- -- stuff and get off the plane and then all get out of the airport.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I told this one gay flight attendant [LAUGH] what happened and he's, like, "You're smoking crack honey". [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] He didn't believe me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I said, "I'm not".  You know -- you know, "Just get your stuff and get out".  And I said, "I have my mother on the phone in Florida, she's got the news on".
L:  Mm.
R:  And it's, like, they didn't even believe me and I -- and I said, "My friend and I are leaving.  You know, you -- you -- if you wanna stay, that's up to you but we just heard they're gonna bomb the airport.  I'm not staying here".
L:  Mm.
R:  So -- and, ah, it was just chaos.
L:  Right.  Now --
R:  Totally.  They had all the passengers out on the curb.
L:  Oh.
R:  And [LAUGH] we stopped at a gas station on the way home and one of my friends, um, sh- -- oh, she had to get gas and this guy was from, like, Australia and he said, "I have to pick up my friend.  He just came off an Orlando flight".  And I said, "Oh, my god.  You poor thing.  Good luck --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because all the passengers are all spread all over.  They're all outside".  And I said, "You're never even gonna find that person".  I said, "I wouldn't even go, you know, over there".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So, um, I don't know how he made out. [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  But --
L:  Now, have you -- you've -- have you flown since?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I flew two weeks after.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I -- I -- I'm -- again, I'm not af- -- I'm not afraid of flying and stuff but it does -- I mean, you do think about it when you're up there, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You think, like, what was it like, you know, for those people?
R:  Oh, god.
L:  That's what I think and I was --
R:  I think that was the w- -- the -- the airplanes was just h- horrible.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I always -- you know, the pilots, they have steel doors now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um -- and I always tease them.  I'm, like, "What if you have to go to the bathroom?" [LAUGH] And they're, like, "Oh, we're -- we're okay".
L:  Hm.
R:  But, um, it's they're -- it's -- they're really good now.  They're just really s- solid.  See, ah -- and we have, um, air marshals that are hidden on the flights --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that nobody really knows, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- they -- we -- we put them on and you don't know who they are.  So --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Even, like, some of them are, like, little four foot eleven ladies.
L:  Huh.
R:  Ah, you would never know.  And it -- I -- I feel a bit better when -- with them on.
L:  I'll say.
R:  No.  They're not on every single flight but they're on a lot of them now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that helps.
L:  Yeah.  I'll say.  Definitely.
R:  So, if you can think of that --
L:  That's -- that's good to know.
R:  -- when you get on a plane [LAUGH].  Like, you know there's, usually, air marshals somewhere.
L:  Sure.  Huh.
R:  But --
L:  So, you gr- -- you --
R:  Oh, you have an exciting job.
L:  What's that?
R:  You have an exciting job.
L:  Yeah.  It's got its ups -- you know, up and down.  Like, we're just, kind of, off the road right now a little bit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, you know, we're just -- there's sometimes when I'm just here in the afternoon doing desk work and, ah, my friend turned me on to this [LAUGH] -- n- -- to this program.  I mean, it was, kinda, neat.
R:  Yeah.  It's good, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do all kinds of, ah -- my girlfriend and I went out today, we did all kinds of surveys.  Like, we were testing makeup, we -- we did -- we went to this other place and did something else.
L:  Huh.
R:  'Cause, um, I'm struggling.  That -- we got pay cuts since nine eleven.  There's no overtime.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The tolls went up [LAUGH].  And, um, forget it.  I don't even have money to get to work sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  Sure.
R:  So --
L:  Huh.
R:  This is a, you know -- a good thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  How many, ah -- what other topics have you been discussing?  Ah, this is my first one.
R:  I do all kinds.  Too bad you don't live in Jersey because I could [LAUGH] hook you up 'cause they're always looking for guys.
L:  Really?
R:  And so- sometimes we've ran outta -- we tell our friends but sometimes we don't have a l- -- enough men to tell.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, a- -- take my email address.
L:  Okay.
R:  If I hear anything [PAUSE] --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Before they cut us off.  It's, um, h- -- it's h- -- the word happy dove --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at AOL --
L:  Okay.
R:  But there's no A. in happy.  It's just H.P.P.Y. --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- D.O.V.E.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at AOL dot com.
L:  Okay.  Good.
R:  And just leave me a note that I met you talking on the Penn State survey.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, ah, we'll see how your -- your band's doing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll have to come see your band one day. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  We're up in New York sometimes.  We play the Bottom Line, the Bitter End, all those, kinda, places --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in town and then, ah --
R:  Did you ever hear The Mongo's?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, they're really good too.  I just met this guy, 'cause I go to -- I see a lotta bands.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're down South Jersey, down by the shore.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  But they have a big following.
L:  What -- yeah.  Okay.  Huh.
R:  But you --
L:  'Cause I got -- I got friends who have, ah, a place in Ocean City, New Jersey.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I mean, it's a -- it's a dry town with no music [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, ah, you know, they go to Sea Isle and some of the other -- Wildwood and places and stuff like that.
R:  Wow.  What do you play?
L:  Ah, I play bass guitar.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  And do some singing.  We have a woman singer so --
R:  Oh.
L:  Female singer and she just had a baby back in April so we, kinda --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- calmed things a little bit here.
