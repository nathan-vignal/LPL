L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a beautiful area.
R:  Oh yeah, it is.  It's really nice.
L:  [NOISE] It's better than this concrete jungle I'm living in here.
R:  [LAUGH] That's all Albany is too.
L:  [COUGH] People are different down here than back east.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you know, you go to say, "Hello" to them and they think -- and they think you're half nuts or something.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] What changes we've made since nine eleven.
R:  I don't hav- how -- how long have you been out in California?
L:  [NOISE] I've been here since nineteen eight two.
R:  Oh really?  How -- how did it affect -- like, how were people in California reacting when it happened?
L:  [NOISE] Oh total -- we totally went into mourning.
R:  That -- that's how it was here too.
L:  It was like my husband and I we were [NOISE] watching -- um, I got up in the morning that it happened --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- and we were -- I thought it was a movie at first. [NOISE]
R:  Wow.  Yeah, I -- I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, go- I was commuting to college at the time and I remember it was on the radio when -- that the first thing had hit.  That the first plane had hit and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was just -- it -- like the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know it -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it didn't register as being a big deal.
L:  Right.
R:  It was -- it just sounded like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Oh, there was an accident, you know, everything's gonna be okay".  And then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by the time I got out of my classes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was like all hell had broke loose 'cause --
L:  [NOISE] Oh lord. [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I was much closer to the city where I was living at the time and like, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody had, you know, someone that down --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there.
L:  Right.
R:  It -- it was crazy at first.  A long time --
L:  Did you have family -- did -- hey, you don't have to call me sir.
R:  Um, my --
L:  [NOISE] Did you have --
R:  -- father -- 
L:  Pardon?
R:  -- oh go ahead.  
L:  I -- I was just ask- --
R:  I'm sorry [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] That's okay.  I was gonna ask you if you had anybody there in -- in that.
R:  Um, I didn't have anyone there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- afterwards I found out, um, like, some acquaintances had been there and had actually been in the building and made it out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- it was freaky, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my father works in the city and he does --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different jobs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at different places --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I had no idea where he was, no way to get in touch with him and it was pretty crazy.
L:  I bet you were frightened.
R:  Oh, it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was probably the worst --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- couple of hours of my life until I finally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tracked him down and figure out where he was.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you -- did you --
L:  Like -- [NOISE]
R:  -- still anyone that was there?
L:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] my husband has a -- has a co worker [NOISE], a priest that lives in -- [NOISE] there in New York.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] it was like his church was, like, a couple of blocks [NOISE] from where all that happened. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So, you -- we were like -- he was frantically trying to get a hold of [NOISE] -- hold of him and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was like [NOISE] he was dumbfounded behind the whole thing.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I can imagine.
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] Well, my husband's a retired lieutenant in the navy [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] my father was in the marine corp [NOISE] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I was in the army.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] So, I'm familiar with [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] -- I'm fa- familiar with things when they're -- people -- other -- other soldiers and, uh, military officials talk about things like that [NOISE] but it is the first time I've ever had to experience anything like this. [NOISE]
R:  Oh yeah.  Well, were you in favor of the war that we had or ...?
L:  [NOISE] Um -- [NOISE]
R:  What were your feelings on that?
L:  I'm -- I'm kinda of biased [NOISE] in that -- o- on that because [NOISE] I -- I don't believe in terrorists -- [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't bel- I don't believe anybody should be hurting anybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm --
R:  I absolutely agree with you.
L:  You know, [NOISE] because --
R:  I was just interested as --
L:  -- we're all on the -- [NOISE] Mm?
R:  Oh go ahead.
L:  No, y- -- [NOISE]
R:  I was interested because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you had mentioned, you know, that you have so -- so many --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- close ties to the military --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- that I was just wondering what your take on the situation was.
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] Well, I was kinda upset --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that it happened [NOISE] but I don't see how our government -- [NOISE] I mean, how [NOISE] -- how our government allowed some people like that in this country.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE] Because, um, when I talked to my mother [NOISE] and my mother told -- um, like she's eighty years old now [NOISE], she said, "Well, we've all got -- Americans have gotten ba- basically lazy --" [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- with protecting ourselves --" [NOISE]
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  "-- since Pearl Harbor --" [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And she goes, "Well, Pearl Harbor was, uh, devastating too" and, uh, [NOISE] then she told me about that [NOISE] [COUGH] and I was like, "Okay --" [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- now I understand where you all come from" oh yeah. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Experiencing it myself, you know, kinda like flabbergasted [NOISE] [inaudible].
R:  Oh yeah.  So, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have you made any changes since September eleventh.
L:  [NOISE] I've -- I still have -- there's a lot of anger --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- about situations [NOISE] but I'm -- I'm seeing a therapy [LAUGH] -- I've gotten into therapy now --
R:  Oh really?
L:  [NOISE] -- to deal with my anger.
R:  Well, that -- that's good.
L:  [NOISE] And also let my guard down a lot since that happened [NOISE].
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] My thinking, the friends that I grew up with, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- won't be [NOISE] the way they are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] -- and [NOISE] I've -- I'm finding out who my true friends are and who my true friends aren't [NOISE].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] It used to be where I used to be able to detect something before it even happens [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm, yeah that kind of hit everybody --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know why.
L:  [NOISE] I -- I live in a small community here in San Francisco called the Tender Line.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And they're simply the people that were, uh -- live around here are either [SIGH] -- [NOISE] I've noticed a lot of crack addicts are out here.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] And it's like, you know, I watch 'em and it's very [NOISE] -- I stay out of the way. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And I -- I don't like leaving my house, [NOISE] not unless I'm accompanied.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] That's a big --
R:  I can definitely [inaudible] that.
L:  [NOISE] And I guess that's a big change in -- because I used to be able to go out by myself [NOISE] now it's like I don't wanna go nowhere unless I'm accompanied.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] That's -- that's a -- big changes like that.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] And the way I carry myself [NOISE] and also the way I kinda talk to people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How -- what are you studying?
R:  English.
L:  English?
R:  Yeah, it -- I don't know what I'm gonna do with it when I'm done but I have a year left.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Then I'll have my --
L:  Well --
R:  -- bachelor's degree.
L:  [NOISE] That's -- that would be a good educ- I mean, a good career.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Be an English teacher or -- or journalist.
R:  I -- I'm thinking maybe more along the lines of an editor.
L:  That's fantastic.
R:  Yeah, so we- we'll see if that works out or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if I end up doing something completely different in graduate school.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And that's one of my -- one of  -- one of my wishes when I was back in school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I write a lot of poetry and [NOISE] I keep several journals [NOISE].
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] I love writing.
R:  Do they have a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do they have a lot of open mics or anything out there?
L:  [NOISE] Yes, they do.  Several different, uh, nightclubs and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There -- there's a lot in Albany all over the place --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's a coup- a lot of different colleges in the area put them on too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a really good way to get out there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and read your stuff.
L:  [NOISE] That's good. [NOISE] And again I'm, uh, I'm a public [NOISE] -- I'm used to public speaking [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but [NOISE] I'm, uh -- I had a job as a health, uh, health care person [NOISE] --
R:  Oh okay.  And how long have you been doing that?
L:  I don't know, eighty six. [NOISE]
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you like it?
L:  [NOISE] It's different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
