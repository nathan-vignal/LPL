L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's Annette.
L:  Annette.  My name's, uh, Dick.
R:  Hi.  So, have you made any [NOISE] changes? [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't really, you know --
R:  Nor me.
L:  -- I've been watching the news and all and all the changes the government's making [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, same here, that's about it.
L:  But I haven't changed anything.
R:  No, me either.  Did you stockpile anything? [LAUGH]
L:  No, not really.
R:  No, us either [LAUGH].  Well, I don't know how we're supposed to talk about this for ten minutes then.
L:  Well, it was a pretty big topic a couple of years ago.
R:  Yeah, it was now it's -- my main thing, I guess, is I have five small kids.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My main thing with that was I was upset, the kids were at school and the schools took it upon themselves to turn on all the TVs and, you know, let the small kids all watch what was going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't think that was appropriate.  
L:  No.
R:  Freaked them out but --
L:  I thought it was the goriest thing to publicize it so much.
R:  Yeah, yeah, who would have -- I don't know maybe I'm --
L:  Likely to have a trauma on kids.
R:  Yeah.  Half the kids, you know, were freaked out they didn't understand, you know, why people would, you know, do something like that and I'm like well neither do I [LAUGH].
L:  No.
R:  So -- so how do you feel about everything about that's going on right now?
L:  Well, we've lost some of our civil liberties because of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With the, um, war on terrorism and all the arrests and bugging and everything that they're doing and they, uh, um, what's the name of that new agency?
R:  Oh, I'm not sure.
L:  Home -- home security or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Agency or something.
R:  Mm.
L:  But that -- where they unified the FBI and the CIA and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- agencies in the government and Justice Department and stuff tell 'em that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, they, uh, because of Iraq, um, do whatever they want with us.
R:  Mhm.  Do you think we should --
L:  I guess eventually when this is over --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with they're gonna -- the Supreme Court's gonna have a decision to make as to whether they're going to continue or not.
R:  Yeah.  Do you think we should --
L:  Um, all this talk of civil lib- liberties.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Do you think we should have done something right after the nine eleven or do you agree with --
L:  What could we have done?  We didn't even know who they were.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they kinda had an idea, didn't they?
L:  Well, they thought it was, uh, Al Qaeda.
R:  That's right.
L:  And I hear it was just some people in Saudi Arabia backing them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What are we gonna do with Saudi Arabia?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, they're the biggest oil country in the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they supposed to be friends of ours and they import oil at low prices and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  What would we do without oil?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I thought we could make, I don't know, enough of our own is what I've heard.
L:  Oh, we can't.
R:  No.
L:  We don't -- we don't have much at all compared to the Middle East.
R:  Well, yeah, compared to them.  What do you think's gonna happen once this, you know, war is, you know, considered to be over?  Do you think things are gonna be better?
L:  I don't know, it'll be forgotten some way and another.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it was an exceptional thing, I don't think it will happen again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Of course they know -- in -- in Washington they have spies and counteragents and all the rest, they know what's going on so if it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- apparently they think it's a threat.  I don't think they're gonna do anything.
R:  Yeah, I'm still nervous that, you know, ob- obviously they --
L:  Are you still nervous?
R:  Well, not to the point where it's like --
L:  Oh, I don't take the planes.
R:  Yeah, it's not affecting my daily routine or anything but obviously there's still people here, you know --
L:  These foreigners.
R:  -- doing whatever, you know, making plans that's, you know, kinda unsettling but it's not, you know, changing my daily life or anything.  If I wanna go travel I'm gonna travel, if I wanna, you know, do whatever, I might not travel to certain countries but [LAUGH] --
L:  I wouldn't travel to the Middle East --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or Africa.
R:  You know, those are places that probably I wouldn't have gone to to begin with.
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't of either.
R:  It's not like they've, you know, ever been like a real peaceful place to go and travel to so ...
L:  Mm.  It's pretty dangerous in Malaysia to, they have terrorism down there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's pretty, uh, rampant but that's confined to M- -- to, uh, Indonesia and Malaysia and those places down there.  They -- they don't come over here and do anything.  But they took lightly and then they, um  -- I expect when they had some terrorist attacks.  So, maybe when we took it seriously it's, uh -- they didn't do it anymore that much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Terrorism's rampant throughout the world --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and it's all over the place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's one [several inaudible words] guerilla terrorism.
R:  Yeah.  Did you -- did you find out, you know, pretty fast, you know, on the day that nine eleven happened?  Did you have the TV or were you home?
L:  Well, actually I was, um, going to dialysis.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I walked in the door and they had the -- the, um, the Twin Towers was on.
R:  Mm.
L:  That was after the first strike --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then before I even went on dialysis about ten o'clock in the morning, eight -- I mean, nine thirty, ten o'clock before I went in to go on dialysis the second -- I think, or maybe it was just after I went in there and watched the second plane hit and thought, "Well, gee, what -- what's going on?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought that was terrible.  I didn't think those Boeings would collapse it.
R:  No, no.
L:  I imagine it's ruined airplane -- the aviation, you don't fly.
R:  I haven't for a long time. [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't either, uh, [inaudible] taking a plane that would be very, uh, rarely.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, especially when, you know, as far as I heard those -- you know, the guys weren't even, you know, like heavily armed or anything it -- you know, based on that the --
L:  All they had was knives, wasn't it?
R:  Was it just knives that they had or something?
L:  [several inaudible words] or something.
R:  Yeah, but yet, you know, they take the plane down or, you know, took control over it or whatever [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm, pretty sad.
L:  It was a terrible thing.
R:  Yeah.  The kids still bring it up, I think last time we went for a ride -- we live in the country so any time we go anywhere it's a half an hour, they were talking about it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talking about the people and did people get out and, you know, what -- what were they thinking and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah. [NOISE] Yeah, I've got a friend that's leaving on Saturday for some countr- I always forget the country, I think in my mind I just keep, you know, purposely forgetting [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's leaving for a year for -- he's known about it for a couple of years, he's a National Guard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, for, you know, the peace talks but there's like an eighty percent chance that, you know, they'll get injured or killed or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The kids are pretty upset up with that, you know, we're just friends and I always think how the hell their kids, his kids feel. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  His wife is pregnant due in October and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the kid'll be almost a year old when he comes -- comes home.
L:  Right.  No, no, no that was a terrible tragedy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All those fine police officers and firemen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and citizens, um, there wasn't like they were -- they were, uh, terrible people or anything they were all upstanding citizens.
R:  Yeah, yes and like --
L:  And they -- they weren't soldiers or anything.
R:  Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, they -- you know, they weren't a job where they thought, you know, something could happen or whatever.
L:  No, nothing gonna happen there probably.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] If the passengers in that flight, you know, in Pennsylvania hadn't taken over, you know, who knows, I mean, where, you know, hundreds of people or thousands of people would have gotten killed.
L:  Yeah, what was it [NOISE] less than three thousand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think there were less than three thousand people that --
R:  Yeah, that's a lot of people, where I live, you know, like near Bakerstown maybe almost, not quite, half the amount of people. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's just for two -- you know, two buildings and the airplanes and stuff.
L:  I was -- I heard there was going to be like fifteen or twenty thousand people but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when those buildings collapsed.
R:  Did you know anyone that worked there?
L:  No, I didn't know anyone.
R:  Yeah, me either. [NOISE]
L:  It hasn't affected me at all really.
R:  Yeah, kinda one of things, you know, you just gotta kinda go on and it made me more aware of, you know, the news and what's going on the in world that I ever really cared before that, you know, to know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It kinda made me more aware but other than that -- and that's about it [NOISE].  You know, but then, you know, you know, it a was terrible tragedy -- you know, strategy -- +tragedy, whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's one of those events that happens like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like when Kennedy was killed --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what were you doing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And someone will say, "What were you doing when Roosevelt was -- when Roosevelt died?"
R:  Mm [NOISE].  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, people say, "What did you do when Lincoln was -- what were you doing when Lincoln was shot?" like, I guess, events in American history that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at the time people will remember --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- exactly what they were doing.
R:  Yeah.  Yes, I remember all my friends calling asking if I was gonna go get the kids [NOISE] out of the school, you know, bring them home and [NOISE] [MN]. [NOISE] Trey, quit.  Oh.
