R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Kate.
L:  I'm Sky.  Like, Sky.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Ah, yeah.  The -- this is my first call. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  It's my third.
L:  Ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't even --
R:  Huh?
L:  I didn't even -- I didn't even do the confirmation thingy.  I didn't think it would happen yet.
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  So --
R:  Well, so have a -- have a -- h- -- what changes have you made in your life since September eleventh?
L:  Um, I don't fly in airplanes anymore.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  It's too -- I just -- just freaked out about it now.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they're -- huh, man.  I've flown, I think, way more after September eleventh.  Not intentionally but just because I have -- I've been traveling a lot more recently so I mean --
L:  I used to f- -- I used to fly but I mean, after that happened, like, it seemed like -- like five planes went down in, like, a half a year or something.
R:  It really was only three but I mean -- but planes go down all the time.  Just -- just 'cause of September eleventh, like, it doesn't mean you should stop flying altogether.  Like, it happens all the time all over the world, you know?
L:  Yeah.  I know that.  It just -- it made me aware of it.  Before, I was, like, blissfully ignorant [LAUGH] I guess.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I guess [LAUGH].  Ah --
L:  Ah, that's about the only thing that's really affected my life I think.  Other than all the flags.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- [LAUGH] I haven't made any changes in my life whatsoever but I think a lot of people have, just the way people are in general now.  In -- in Manhattan, it's very different.  People are --
L:  A- --
R:  -- more depressed. [LAUGH]
L:  You're in Manhattan?
R:  Yeah.  I work -- I work in Manhattan but I live in Brooklyn.  So --
L:  Oh, see --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Texas.
R:  Oh.  Oh, you're far away.  It wasn't so bad.  I just -- it was really bad when it happened 'cause --
L:  Yeah.  I can imagine that.
R:  -- I was worried about, like, friends and family, of course.  Yeah.  But no.  Nobody I know has really made any changes.  It just seems like more -- more or less, like, people in the city now instead of like being racist towards, you know, certain people, like, Indian people are now hated and, like, Pakistani people are hated more so than -- [LAUGH] than others.
L:  Yeah.  I hear --
R:  You know?
L:  I hear a lot of, ah, d- derogatory things towards the Indian people now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that is a change.
R:  Yeah.  I- it's definitely the new -- the new hated group of people.  But I thought I h- -- like --
L:  That, kinda, sucks for them.
R:  I- it's really bad.  Like, it's so unfair.  But I guess it happens like that so ...
L:  Yeah.  Only like a -- like, two percent of them are, like, crazy terrorists. [LAUGH] That's kind- --
R:  Even less.  Come on, two per cent?  Where do you get these numbers?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, did that [LAUGH] -- did that come out of nowhere? [LAUGH]
L:  Alrighty, I make them up.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I could say -- it's probably more like point one percent of the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- population.
L:  Well, you get --
R:  Especially considering, like, how many people live there.  There's so many countries too.
L:  But you understand my point.
R:  Yes.  I -- I --
L:  It's not a lot.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's a very, very small percent.
R:  But, yeah, anyway.  But this to, ah, what changes you've made in your life?  I g- -- god, ten minutes.  Um --
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.  So, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I [SIGH] -- Jesus, this is bad.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  I didn't really change anything specifically.
R:  I -- I know.  I don't know how they want us to talk about this for ten minutes.  And they say we have to talk about it for at least eight minutes.  God.
L:  Um --
R:  Nobody I know --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- has made any changes either but --
L:  I know one thing that changed.  Um, before it happened I h- -- I had a American flag and I put it upside down in my car.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, like, after it happened, I had to take it off because I almost got run off the road.
R:  Really?
L:  People really -- yeah.  People were mad.
R:  Why?
L:  'Cause -- 'cause I was unpatriotic I guess.
R:  Oh, whatever.  I -- I really don't like to see -- like, it really bothered me when everybody started putting up their flags all over the place just because that happened.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It shouldn't make you more American.  It should make you more aware of other cultures and other situations and, like, it make you be more interested in other things.  Like, America's not so great and that's why they attacked us.  You know, that's what it tells you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It tells you that we fucked up in some way and made people so angry that they're willing to, like, kill other people and kill themselves for it.  So ...
L:  I don't really think it's our fault.
R:  I think --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- a lot of it is.  Of course it is.  All y- --
L:  Well, it's just the way we are though.
R:  Huh?
L:  That's all that mat- -- they just -- ah, I don't know.
R:  What do you mean?
L:  Then they just, ah --
R:  Of course it's our fault.  Like, please, we train them, we gave them uniforms and then we, like, left 'em there.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  We -- we tried to, like, get them to attack the USSR and as soon as they did, we didn't help 'em.  So, what do you expect?  And, like, we leave their people to be tormented by that government that we put up in- in- in- in- into the country.  Of course.  Like, [MN] these poor people are so oppressed and have, like, nothing.
L:  It doesn't give 'em a right to fly planes into us.
R:  No, it doesn't.  But if, like, nothing else helps, I mean, I guess you become desperate.  When the situation is that desperate when, like, you don't really have much to live for, people don't care.  That's all it tells you about that.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] [PAUSE] Anyway ...  Anyway, see I d- -- my grandpa put up flags all over my car.  He was -- he was a little, like, excited about -- about that whole thing but I think it was more the spirit of it.  Just, kinda, the whole solidarity.
L:  Yeah.  We had, like, a good, like, American yay vibe going for a while.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Ah --
L:  You know, lots of TV about it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I remember that.  That changed my life I guess.
R:  Yeah.  So, I just think, basically --
L:  It was just, like --
R:  -- we're all more racist now.  More racist than before.  That -- that's the biggest change I've noticed if anything.
L:  Yeah.  Anyone who's, like, wearing, ah, anything Middle Eastern is now a terrorist.
R:  Yeah.  And it's funny in the planes too when we fly and they ch- -- search all these people.  Like, I don't understand why they search me and then they search this lady in a wheelchair -- like, an old lady in a wheelchair.  You know, they make her get up and, like, search the insides of the wheelchair.  Like, it's so ridiculous.  It's not the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- most efficient way to do it either.  I was, like, "Come on man".  Like, [LAUGH] -- I was wondering, you know, what if you're wearing a cast?  Like, you can, you know, theoretically, put something in there if you really wanted to. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I saw the thing where someone had stuff hidden in this, ah, fake leg.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  A prosthetic leg.  'Cause when I saw 'em checking him, I was, like, "That's horrible".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they found drugs in it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Oh, that's a good way to go.  I guess it's more safe than trying to swallow it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I mean, but that's just weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How'd they know to check that?
R:  I -- I guess they do.  Like, if people have tried it before, many a time, I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not exactly an original thought but, ah ...  Yeah.  So ...  So, how old are you?
L:  How what?
R:  How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty.
R:  Twenty?  Okay.
L:  I'm twenty in, like, four days.
R:  All right. [MN]
L:  How old are you?
R:  Twenty one.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I signed up for this thing, like, last night.
R:  Yeah.  I did this, like, two days ago.  I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't think it was real.  I was, like, "Come on man.  They can't pay us ten bucks to talk for ten minutes".  But I guess they do.  So, we'll see.
L:  Do we still get the money if we don't talk about the topic?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah ...  So, any- -- know anybody else that's made any changes in their life?  How about that?
L:  Um, I -- beside from putting up the flags and the, yeah, racism thing, I -- I didn't -- really didn't see a change.
R:  I know.  I mean, what changes can you really make in your life?  Like, you have to just keep living the same thing you were doing before.  There's not much that you can do about that.  Like, you just gotta keep going.  Like, w- what can people really do?  I don't know.
L:  For -- for a while, people were hoarding gas.
R:  Were they?
L:  They were.  They were, like, going crazy about it where I was from.
R:  Oh.  No, nobody here was really -- not that I mean --
L:  I was --
R:  Not that I know of.  But, I mean --
L:  Like --
R:  -- the economy went -- went to shit and all these restaurants closed down and all these, like, great places downtown have now disappeared, you know?  But ...
L:  For, like the day after it happened, ah, there was like lines, like, half a mile, a mile long, outta gas stations.
R:  Huh.
L:  People -- they just filling up, like, everything, like -- they had -- like, fill up their --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- cars and the tanks, fill them [inaudible] whatever.
R:  See, I -- the -- yeah, that's -- that's so, like -- that's an American thing to do.  Like, we get into a war and we're afraid that we won't have gas to drive our cars.  God, that's so fucking ridiculous.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what worries them?  Oh, my god.  I don't know.  I'm -- I go to school upstate at -- in Cornell so I -- we didn't have any of those problems up there.
L:  Real[?] obsession[?] -- for me that day is I needed gas.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I had to wait and I was, like, "Man".  'Cause I knew there wasn't gonna be any, like, gas problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And people were, like, charging.  They raised the prices.
R:  Of course.  Because the demand goes up by so much.
L:  Yeah.  But all the gas stations that did that ended up getting fined.
R:  Really?
L:  'Cause it's like -- it's like against some law to, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause there was, like, a situation, I guess, and they took advantage of it.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  I can see that.
L:  So, they can't raise their prices more than, like, five cents or --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- something like that or they get fined.
R:  Interesting. [LIPSMACK] Ah ... hm ...
L:  So, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I'm trying to think.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Huh.
L:  I wish it was, like, ah, new release games.
R:  Oh, but I do -- a -- a lotta people started taking the train at different hours.  That's what happened.  I know a lotta -- lotta people stopped taking 'em during rush hours.  And I remember, um, even when I came back to the city for a winter break, ah, everybody was afraid to ride the train during, um, you know, rush hour and certain times so everybody would try to take 'em as -- as little as they can.  I know a lotta people started taking the buses actually w- which is silly but --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it sorta makes sense because, like, I'd be on the train and often times we had bomb scares.  Like, they'd evacuate train stations over and over again and all it was was bullshit.  All of it.  All of it was crap.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, it was just them scaring us 'cause it was the whole, um, anthrax thing and then it winds up being it's the American government.  So ...  N- --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I was from a small town in Illinois so we didn't have many bomb threats and --
R:  Yeah.  No.  'Cause all these people were suddenly, you know, getting anthrax and all this stuff and we didn't really -- there weren't too many bomb threats I don't think.  But it was more the anthrax and trains and everything and they were gonna release it in there and everybody would get sick and all of this.  But it was -- it was -- it didn't happen.  It didn't happen at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Uh --
R:  Thankfully.
L:  Were there any -- like, were there even really anthrax attacks?
R:  There were a couple of people here but --
L:  Didn't, like -- didn't they get mailed to -- mailed to their house?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it was -- it was just like --
L:  But there was none, like --
R:  -- somebo- -- and then there were a couple of, like, very random cases that nobody knew where it came from.  But then -- but then one of 'em, like, had contact with, like, the scientist who was responsible for it or something like that.  I don't -- I don't really know.
L:  There wasn't, like, any large scale attacks was there?
R:  No.
