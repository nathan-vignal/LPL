I'M A BIG CHANNEL SURFER BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT STATIONS AND EVEN THE NEWS STATIONS TO SEE WHO'S REPORTING WHAT AND I LIKED HOW UM HEADLINE NEWS IN C._N._N. THEY HAVE IT SCROLLING  (fe_03_06104-A-0032)
ACROSS EVERY THIRTY MINUTES THEY UPDATE IT SO IT GIVES YOU INSTEAD OF JUST A LITTLE SCROLL IT GIVES LIKE OTHER STORIES BESIDES ALL THE WAR COVERAGE THEY'LL GIVE YOU OTHER STORIES AND STUFF SO THAT WAS NICE AND UM  (fe_03_06104-A-0033)
YEAH MORNING SHOWS  (fe_03_06104-A-0034)
MHM  (fe_03_06104-A-0035)
MHM  (fe_03_06104-A-0036)
IN THE MORNING SHOWS YEAH I THINK THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING IN THEIR COVERAGE ALSO INSTEAD OF IT BEING A LITTLE MORE SUITED AND STUFFY  (fe_03_06104-A-0037)
WITH THE OLDER REPORTERS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06104-A-0038)
YEAH KENNY KIRK IS WHAT BETTER TO LISTEN TO THAN THAN RATHER BUT UM WELL THEN ALSO I THINK  (fe_03_06104-A-0039)
NOWADAYS LIKE SIXTY MINUTES AND DATELINE  (fe_03_06104-A-0040)
THEY'RE DOING THE REPORTS WHERE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A NEWS IT'S A NEWS BASED SHOW AND THEY HANDLE CURRENT EVENTS BUT IT'S NOT JUST LIKE WATCHING YOUR SIX O'CLOCK NEWS THEY CAN GET SOME INTERESTING TOPICS ON THOSE SHOWS ALSO  (fe_03_06104-A-0041)
A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH  (fe_03_06104-A-0043)
THAN JUST THE HEADLINE NEWS  (fe_03_06104-A-0044)
YEAH  (fe_03_06104-A-0045)
RIGHT LIKE I'LL I'LL SEE SOMETHING ON THE NEWS LIKE WHEN WE ACTUALLY STARTED BOMBING UM I SAW IT HA- AS IT WAS HAPPENING ON T._V. AND SO I CALLED HIM REAL QUICK AT WORK 'CAUSE HE'S STILL STATE SIDE  (fe_03_06104-A-0047)
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT AT THE TIME  (fe_03_06104-A-0048)
SO 'CAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A RADIO ON THEY DIDN'T HAVE A T._V. ON THAT'S ANOTHER THING WE GET IT ON THE RADIO OBVIOUSLY THEY BREAK IN WITH SPECIAL REPORTS UM SO I INFORMED HIM SO THAT W- THEY COULD GET TO SOMEWHERE THAT TO GET INFORMATION BUT THERE'S  (fe_03_06104-A-0049)
OTHER INSTANCES WHERE  (fe_03_06104-A-0050)
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY TYPE THINGS BUT THERE COULD BE EVENTS WHERE THERE'S THINGS THAT MAY POSSIBLY EVERYTHING'S A MAY POSSIBLY HAPPEN THEY'RE LIKE NEVER SET IN STONE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS  (fe_03_06104-A-0051)
SO LIKE IF THEY'RE GONNA HAVE DEPLOYMENTS TO RELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE THAT'S A POSSIBILITY OR  (fe_03_06104-A-0052)
SO IT'S NOT REALLY NECESSARILY CURRENT EVENTS THAT I GET FROM MY HUSBAND BUT JUST THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR LIFESTYLE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING OR WHATNOT  (fe_03_06104-A-0053)
BUT  (fe_03_06104-A-0054)
MHM  (fe_03_06104-A-0055)
YEAH EXACTLY  (fe_03_06104-A-0056)
YEAH Y- THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH ACCESS TO IT AND SUCH WITH THE MEDIA COVERAGE IT IS TRUE THAT  (fe_03_06104-A-0057)
IT SEEMS AS IF THAT EVERYBODY ELSE KNOWS MORE THAN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN THE MILITARY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY JUST GET BRIEFED AS TO WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW  (fe_03_06104-A-0058)
SO IT'S LIKE I GET  (fe_03_06104-A-0059)
UM  (fe_03_06104-A-0060)
MORE SO CURRENT EVENTS LOCALLY HERE ON BASE LIKE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON BASE CURRENT EVENT WISE THEN MY HUSBAND'LL TELL ME 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES ON ON BASE  (fe_03_06104-A-0061)
SO IF WE HAVE SOMEBODY COME IN TO VISIT LIKE WE HAD UM THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND AND SO THEY'LL COME AND TELL ME ABOUT IT SO I KNOW DON'T GO ON BASE THAT DAY 'CAUSE SECURITY'S GONNA BE HORRIBLE  (fe_03_06104-A-0062)
AND UM  (fe_03_06104-A-0063)
SO IT'S MORE SO LIKE LOCAL CURRENT EVENTS ON BASE I GET FROM HIM MORE SO THAN THE NATIONAL STUFF AND THE NATIONAL STUFF HE GETS MORE INFORMATION FROM THE MEDIA THAN WHAT THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT AT WORK UNLESS LIKE SOME OF OUR TROOPS ARE COMING HOME THEN OBVIOUSLY HE KNOWS ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_06104-A-0064)
SO  (fe_03_06104-A-0065)
THAT TYPE OF THING IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY OF IT I GUESS BUT  (fe_03_06104-A-0066)
NO  (fe_03_06104-A-0067)
YEAH LIKE JUST LIKE A MORNING SHOW THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT I ENJOY IN THE MORNING WOULD BE A MORNING SHOW WHERE THEY'RE DOING THE NEWS AND EVEN SO THAT IS MORE OF A COMICAL TYPE NEWS OR MAKING FUN OF THINGS  (fe_03_06104-A-0068)
YEAH I JUST TRY NOT TO GET TOO PREOCCUPIED IN THE CURRENT EVENTS BUT I LIKE TO KNOW SOME OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT GO ON BUT  (fe_03_06104-A-0069)

MHM  (fe_03_06104-A-0081)
YEAH  (fe_03_06104-A-0082)
[LIPSMACK] I'M TRYING TO THINK WHAT OTHER CURRENT EVENTS ARE GOING ON  (fe_03_06104-A-0084)
THIS I 'CAUSE THE TOPIC I UNDERSTAND IS TALKING ABOUT THE CURRENT EVENTS WHERE WE GET IT FROM  (fe_03_06104-A-0085)
NOT NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT THE CURRENT EVENTS THAT ARE GOING ON BUT WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR CURRENT EVENTS FROM  (fe_03_06104-A-0086)
YEAH  (fe_03_06104-A-0087)
WELL THE OTHER THING WOULD BE UM  (fe_03_06104-A-0088)
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND THAT'S KIND OF COMICAL ON MY PART 'CAUSE MY MOTHER IN LAW WILL ALWAYS CALL ME AND TELL ME WHAT'S ON T._V. OR OR WHAT SHE'S HEARD OR WHATNOT AND MY MOTHER IN LAW'S NOTORIOUS FOR GETTING THINGS TOTALLY TWISTED  (fe_03_06104-A-0089)
SO YOU TELL HER ONE THING AND TWO SECONDS LATER WHILE YOU'RE STILL IN THE ROOM SHE WILL TELL SOMEBODY ELSE WITH HER OWN PITCH ON IT  (fe_03_06104-A-0090)
AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND IT'S NOT THE SAME THING BUT I'M JUST LIKE OKAY WHATEVER BUT SHE'S ANOTHER ONE SHE'S NOTORIOUS FOR CALLING ME ESPECIALLY DURING THE WARTIME STUFF  (fe_03_06104-A-0091)
MM FREAKING OUT ABOUT IT AND TELLING ME WHAT'S GOING ON AND  (fe_03_06104-A-0092)
TURN ON THE T._V. AND WHAT HAS BOBBY HEARD OR IS HE GONNA GO THERE OR WHATNOT AND I'M LIKE OKAY  (fe_03_06104-A-0093)
SO  (fe_03_06104-A-0094)
