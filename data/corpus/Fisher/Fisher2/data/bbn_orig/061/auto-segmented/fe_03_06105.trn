I THINK THEY PROBABLY JUST DID FORGET TO PUT IT IN THERE BECAUSE MOST MOSTLY THAT'S HOW I GET MY NEWS I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR WATCHING THE NEWS ON TELEVISION SIMPLY BECAUSE I JUST DON'T WATCH A WHOLE LOT OF TELEVISION  (fe_03_06105-A-0007)
AND [SIGH] WHAT I DON'T GET FROM THE INTERNET I GET FROM THE RADIO  (fe_03_06105-A-0008)
UM  (fe_03_06105-A-0009)

YEAH WHICH IS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE INTERNET BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER WHAT YOU READ  (fe_03_06105-A-0011)
AND WHEN YOU READ IT BUT HOW MUCH TIME YOU GET TO SPEND ON IT BECAUSE IT WITH THE NEWS ON TELEVISION THEY JUST KIND OF GO THROUGH IT [NOISE] YOU KNOW [NOISE] JUST LIKE THAT [NOISE] AND THEY DON'T REALLY THEY DON'T REALLY GIVE YOU  (fe_03_06105-A-0012)
YEAH IT'S NOT VERY IN DEPTH AT ALL SO YOU DON'T REALLY GET ALL THE DETAILS AND FIND OUT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON THEN MOST OF THE TIME ON THE NEWS THEY REP- THEY REPEAT THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER  (fe_03_06105-A-0013)
YEAH  (fe_03_06105-A-0015)

YEAH USUALLY RECYCLING [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06105-A-0020)
USUALLY RECYCLING  (fe_03_06105-A-0021)
IT'S B- IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S A WASTE OF PAPER SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NOTHING IN THERE TO READ THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN ON THE INTERNET OR HEARD ON THE RADIO  (fe_03_06105-A-0022)
THERE'S JUST NO FRESH NEWS  (fe_03_06105-A-0023)
WHEREAS WITH THE INTERNET YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO WHATEVER CITY YOU WANT YOU WANNA FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN PHILADELPHIA YOU LOOK FOR THE PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER AND YOU READ IT ONLINE YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR IT YEAH AND HAVE IT DELIVERED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO [SIGH]  (fe_03_06105-A-0024)

MHM  (fe_03_06105-A-0028)
YEAH [LAUGHTER] I THINK SOMETIMES THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE MOST MOST NEWSCASTERS GET THEIR STUFF IS FROM THE INTERNET BECAUSE  (fe_03_06105-A-0031)
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON THE STREET THE FIRST THING THEY DO IS SIT DOWN AT THE COMPUTER AND START TYPING OUT WHATEVER'S GOING ON WHATEVER THEY SEE  (fe_03_06105-A-0032)
THAT'S WHAT I DO I DON'T I DON'T WASTE TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WELL WHO SHOULD I TELL THIS AND HOW SHOULD I I JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE COMPUTER AND LOOK FOR WHAT I WANT  (fe_03_06105-A-0033)
IT'S THE SAME WAY WITH TRYING TO FIND ANYTHING LIKE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TRAVEL AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A GREAT A GREAT DEAL OR A GOOD PLACE TO GO OR YOU WANNA FIND OUT ABOUT WHEREVER YOU CHOSE TO GO THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT IS ON THE INTERNET THEN YOU CAN FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT  (fe_03_06105-A-0034)
WHAT THE CRIME IS LIKE WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS LIKE THAT'S STUFF THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GET FROM A TRAVEL AGENCY OR FROM  (fe_03_06105-A-0035)
WATCHING THE NEWS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT WHICH I THINK IS A HUGE HUGE LOSS  (fe_03_06105-A-0036)
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY GET THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR  (fe_03_06105-A-0037)
YEAH  (fe_03_06105-A-0039)
YOU KNOW WHAT I HARDLY EVER DO THAT T- I HARDLY EVER DO THAT EITHER AND YOU'LL FIND THE BEST DEALS ON THE INTERNET BEFORE YOU CAN FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE  (fe_03_06105-A-0040)
'CAUSE I MEAN EVEN THOUGH THEY ADVERTISE ON TELEVISION BY THE TIME THEY'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'VE FILMED THE COMMERCIAL AND  (fe_03_06105-A-0041)

AND SO THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I PRIMARILY SPEND TIME READING I DON'T REALLY PAY A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO NEWSWEEK AT ALL BUT  (fe_03_06105-A-0049)
YEAH Y- I USED TO READ U._S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT TOO BUT I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I EVEN WELL IT'S NOT EVEN A MAGAZINE IT'S JUST THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY PAPER I CAN SAY YEAH THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY PAPER I CAN SAY THAT I READ  (fe_03_06105-A-0050)

SO  (fe_03_06105-A-0060)
WHY WOULD YOU NOT HAVE THE INTERNET [LAUGHTER] AS A CHOICE  (fe_03_06105-A-0061)

I THINK THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN EVEN FIND OBJECTIVE TYPE NEWS ANY MORE IS ON N._P._R. OR SOME RADIO STATION BRITISH RADIO STATION THAT THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE AN INTEREST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER  (fe_03_06105-A-0072)
IN WHAT'S GOING ON EXCEPT FOR COMMON INTEREST OF WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS NOW NOT THEY HAVE ANYTHING STAKED IN IT OR YEAH  (fe_03_06105-A-0073)

EXACTLY AND THERE'S SO THERE'S MORE THAN JUST ONE PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_06105-A-0079)
THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE SIDE TO ANY ISSUE BUT IF YOU ONLY GET ONE SIDE HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO REALLY BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY KIND OF INFORMED DECISION ABOUT ANYTHING IF ALL YOU'RE HEARING IS JUST A PIECE OF THE INFORMATION IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR  (fe_03_06105-A-0080)
