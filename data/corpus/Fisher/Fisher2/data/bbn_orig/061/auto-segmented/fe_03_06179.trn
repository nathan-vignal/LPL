I CAN'T I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO COMMIT TO A NEWSPAPER FOR A WHILE I GOT THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR BECAUSE IT HAD REALLY GOOD UM INTERNATIONAL NEWS IT WAS  (fe_03_06179-B-0022)
THE PAPER IT'S ACTUALLY THEY HAVE ONE RELIGION ARTICLE IN THERE AND IT'S WELL LABELED SO YOU CAN AVOID IT IF YOU WANT TO BUT ALL THE REST OF THE NEWS IT'S LIKE INTERNATIONAL S- NEWS  (fe_03_06179-B-0023)
AND IT'S KNOWN FOR BEING UNBIASED AND THE COVERAGE IS USUALLY REALLY GOOD IT'S THE ARTICLES ARE LONGER THAN TYPICAL NEWS STORIES AND THEY COVER THINGS THAT YOU DON'T NORMALLY HEAR ABOUT ON THE IN THE NORMAL MEDIA  (fe_03_06179-B-0024)
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS WHEN WHEN I WAS GETTING THAT ONE I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY THE BEST PAPER I HAD EVER READ  (fe_03_06179-B-0025)

THINK IT'S DAILY IT'S EITHER DAILY OR WEEKLY I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S DAILY  (fe_03_06179-B-0027)
AND IT'S NOT IT'S A LITTLE BIT M- THE THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT UM AND ALSO I CAN'T COMMIT TO READING A NEWSPAPER SO I HAVEN'T READ ONE IN A LONG TIME BUT IT WAS THAT WAS THE BEST NEWSPAPER I LOVE THAT NEWSPAPER  (fe_03_06179-B-0028)

I GUESS EVERY ISSUE THEY DO IT SOME KIND OF ACTUAL JOURNALISTIC PIECE BUT I I THINK IT'S A PRETTY GOOD MAGAZINE ALSO  (fe_03_06179-B-0037)
BUT YEAH I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I THE THE T._V. MEDIA I FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE OR LESS USELESS [LAUGHTER] EVEN I DON'T EVEN BOTHER ANYMORE BECAUSE IT JUST IT JUST FEELS LIKE W- I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN TRUST IT AND  (fe_03_06179-B-0038)

I WISH THAT I COULD'VE SEEN THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY FRENCH NEWS IN A LONG TIME  (fe_03_06179-B-0046)
UH EVEN THE B._B._C. UH EVEN THE B._B._C. WAS INTERESTING TO JUST HEAR TO HEAR A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OR THE OTHER ONE THAT'S REALLY GOOD IS THE CANADIAN BROADCASTING  (fe_03_06179-B-0047)
UM TO HEAR BOTH OF THEM ESPECIALLY FOR THE WAR COVERAGE IT WAS THAT WAS FASCINATING I ALWAYS I LIKED THAT BECAUSE WE GET A VERY SINGULAR VIEW OF THINGS FROM HERE AND WHEN YOU CAN HEAR THE FRENCH NEWS WOULD'VE BEEN ESPECIALLY NICE I WISH THAT WE COULD'VE  (fe_03_06179-B-0048)
WHAT DID THEY WHAT DID THEY SAY  (fe_03_06179-B-0049)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06179-B-0050)
AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY MORE LIKE FIFTY PEOPLE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06179-B-0051)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06179-B-0052)
YEAH THE THE THING THAT I NOTICED ABOUT THAT COVERAGE EVEN THE IN THE AMERICAN NEWS THEY SORTA DOWNPLAYED THAT BUT UM IN THAT THAT PARTICULAR SQUARE WHAT YOU SAW WAS SOME AMERICAN SOLDIERS PULLING DOWN THE STATUE AND ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE CROWDED AROUND THEM  (fe_03_06179-B-0053)
AND THEN THE REST OF THE ENTIRE IF YOU LOOK BEHIND THAT FAMOUS PICTURE IF YOU LOOK BEHIND THE FIRST LAYER OF PEOPLE THE STREETS ARE COMPLETELY EMPTY AND THERE'S NOBODY ELSE OUT AND I I THINK THAT WAS REALLY TELLING 'CAUSE IT IT R- THAT REALLY SAID THAT  (fe_03_06179-B-0054)
THERE REALLY WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE AND THAT WAS IT  (fe_03_06179-B-0055)
SO THAT'S INTERESTING WELL YEAH IT'S A SHAME WE DON'T GET I I WISH THAT WE GOT A BROADER RANGE OF COVERAGE HERE I WISH THAT WE GOT MORE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_06179-B-0057)
WELL I GUESS I WE'RE ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM BOSTON OR MAYBE FORTY FORTY FIVE MINUTES FROM HARTFORD SO AND IT'S A IT'S A FUNNY AREA IT'S KIND OF A LIBERAL UTOPIA AND EVERYTHING IS VERY LEFT WING HERE  (fe_03_06179-B-0058)
AND UM SO I GUESS I'M I'M KIND OF SURPRISED I MEAN AMHERST CAN'T REALLY CREATE A NEWS ORGANIZATION OF ITS OWN IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW NEW YORK OR SOMEPLACE BUT I'M I GUESS I'M [MN] I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE UNITED STATES IN GENERAL GETTING MORE  (fe_03_06179-B-0059)
THAT WAS ALWAYS SURPRISING YOU KNOW I HAD A A FRIEND OF MINE UM CAME TO VISIT FROM SWITZERLAND IN THE FALL AND SHE WAS I WAS TELLING HER THAT THAT AMERICANS ARE ACTUALLY NOT PRO WAR  (fe_03_06179-B-0061)

TAKE ANY STANCE AT ALL SO  (fe_03_06179-B-0064)
[LAUGHTER] WELL I THINK I THINK I I KIND OF THINK THAT THE AMERICAN MEDIA SORT OF UM I I NOTICED DURING THE DEMONSTRATIONS THAT IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE COVERAGE OF THE DEMONSTRATIONS AS YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06179-B-0065)
[MN] IN IN A POSITIVE WAY THERE WAS COVERAGE OF THE DEMONSTRATION BUT THEY SORT OF MINIMIZED IT LIKE THEY WOULD THEY JUST WOULDN'T  (fe_03_06179-B-0066)
THEY WOULDN'T  (fe_03_06179-B-0067)
IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE SORT OF MINIMIZING THE ENTIRE ANTI WAR MOVEMENT IN A IN A CERTAIN WAY AND SO I THINK THAT  (fe_03_06179-B-0068)
A BROAD UM AMERICANS WERE INCLINED TO PROJECT THEMSELVES AS UNIFIED FOR THE ACTION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING WHICH IS WHICH IS KIND OF A SHAME BECAUSE I THINK IT IT REALLY DID  (fe_03_06179-B-0069)
GIVE PEOPLE THE WRONG IMPRESSION  (fe_03_06179-B-0070)
UM BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT  (fe_03_06179-B-0071)
[SIGH] GIVEN THAT IT WAS A DECISION THAT WAS MADE SORT OF WITHOUT  (fe_03_06179-B-0072)
CONSIDERING  (fe_03_06179-B-0073)
WITHOUT AMERICAN WITHOUT AMERICAN INPUT SORT OF UM MAYBE THERE WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO SAY OKAY WELL WE'RE DOING THIS THING WE'RE BEHIND IT I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06179-B-0074)
RATHER THAN PRESENT A DIVIDED FRONT  (fe_03_06179-B-0075)
