L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  Hi!
L:  [LAUGH]  Hi!
R:  Hello --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm Christie.
L:  I'm Angie.
R:  Hello!
L:  Hello!  [LAUGH]
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Um, from Virginia.
R:  Okay.
L:  And how about yourself?
R:  Um, I'm from Michigan.
L:  Michigan, okay.
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, ...
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, do you want to start?  [NOISE]
L:  Sure.  Um, --
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I guess I get a lot of my news probably from the television.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I mean current events stuff.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [MN]  [SIGH]  Ah, over the Internet a little bit, I'm usually on the --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- Internet every day and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's mostly, you know, TV and, um, [LIPSMACK] looking -- ah, listening to the radio --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- in the car.
R:  That's -- mine is usually either the TV or the Internet.
L:  The Internet.
R:  That's -- yeah, I'm on the Internet every day too, so it would be -- you know, that would be ... most of the thing, you know.  But other than that it would be, like, TV if I was [SIGH] turning it on and something was on but [SIGH] I --
L:  [SIGH]  You --
R:  -- don't usually ever look at a newspaper.  So, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I was just --
R:  -- it wouldn't be that.
L:  -- going to say, do you get --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the newspaper?
R:  [SIGH]  N- n- no not at all.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I wouldn't -- I wouldn't t even look at a newspaper p- probably.  [SIGH]  Um, and people I know would probably not be [NOISE] -- you know, that's not something that [SIGH] you know, what I mean [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- not something that we would all sit around and talk -- you know, not something [NOISE] that would go, "Hey, this happened!" you know.  [SIGH]  It [NOISE] would most probably be like TV or Internet.
L:  Right.  And a lot of it's, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, a lot of what we talk about is more local.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, some international with the war with Iraq and stuff but --
R:  Uh-hum.  Yeah.
L:  -- um, those are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably two things.  Actually, we're --
R:  Yeah, I mean -- I'm sorry.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Well, as people like -- if you know like you could -- with local events and stuff, you know, if my fr- -- you know, we're sitting around we'll talk about that stuff but, [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] -- yeah, you know, like you said, Iraq, you know, that type -- kind of something big.  But if it's something just, ... ah, you know, like something on the TV that I had seen, it's not something that our -- you know, like the friend -- you know, our group of friends would sit around and, "Hey, did you ne -- did you see --"
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  "-- the news?"  [LAUGH]  You know, what I mean?  But, um --
L:  What --
R:  -- most of it is, like, usually when I turn the, um, Internet on, you know.  Like your home page has all the news on the front page --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I usually, like, scan on it and if there's something that looks interesting, [SIGH] [MN] I stop and read it or c- click on it or, you know, bring it up and see what, you know, what it is.  But -- [MN] other than th- --
L:  Do you have kids at all?
R:  Yes, I have two of them.
L:  Yeah, and I guess another thing with th- the television I try not to have the news on too much --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- because it ... causes a lot of questions.  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I --
L:  -- I have a five year old so he's -- I mean a four and a half year old so he's just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- getting into [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- picking up things and he'll come in and he'll say something and I'll be like, "Now where did you get that?"  And it was --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- something that came on during his -- at one of his shows.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like a break in that said, "Coming up on news --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- on Channel Six" or something.
R:  Uh-hum.  I have a ... three year old and a one year old.
L:  Ah, I have a --
R:  Though they're not really ... into that, you know, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- really.  But [SIGH] usually the only time I turn the TV on anyways is like in the morning, like, before they're up, you know.  Like I sit and watch [SIGH] the first part like of the Today Show or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- something, you know, kind of like that stuff.
L:  Oh, they must like to sleep a little bit then?
R:  Oh, yeah, they sleep in until about eight or eight thirty.
L:  Oh, that's great!  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it's nice.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  'Cause I --
R:  Now it's nice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I have a two year old and a ... five year old and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, I said four and a half and so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] they're up at, like, s- six thirty or seven.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yeah, it is -- it's sad, but we all c- climb in bed and they turn on [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- ah, Clifford, or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, exactly.
L:  And I'll sleep till seven thirty.
R:  Dragon Tales and all those.
L:  Exactly. 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Yeah.  I guess that my, um, one year old has just started, you know, like sleeping in -- you know, until eight or eight thirty.  It used to be [SIGH] six thirty, seven and if -- but, you know, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- now it's pretty nice.  And most of the time I'm up anyways but at least it's time where I can just relax [NOISE] by myself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Which, you know, I usually just turn the Today Show on and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- either sit and watch that or I usually try to get my computer stuff done, if I have a lot of stuff to do in my room so ...
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Um, but other than t- that, I -- t- the radio is mostly, if I listen to it, is for music.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But you know, I don't really ...
L:  Well, I usually -- I guess I take my son to preschool at n- nine and sometimes pick him up at twelve.  And so, like, on the hour they usually have the news -- like the --
R:  Oh, uh-hum.
L: -- highlights of the news and stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And I'm usually in the car during that time --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- so I'll get that, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] a little bit.  But I --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- guess during times -- like during, ah, Christmas vacation and stuff like that it's like I've -- I feel like I don't ... get caught up because I haven't listened to the [LAUGH] n- news --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- because I'm not in my car at all.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  So, there's lots of things ...
R:  That's, um, -- I know -- ah, the [NOISE] newspaper would be ... one thing -- I mean, do you get the newspaper?
L:  Um, I do and actually we just recently started getting it probably in the last, ah, definitely within the last year.  Um, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- but, ah, my reasoning is for more c- [LAUGH] coupons --
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- to see what the specials --
R:  -- that's why we do --
L:  -- of the week are.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- one -- yeah, ex- -- yeah, we get one, like, on Sundays.
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's so funny because like -- 'cause I don't live, like, where my parents live, they'll come down, like, for a weekend or something.  And it's so funny 'cause we get like [SIGH] three papers but, a- all we do is get [SIGH] like, the inserts and the coupons out and --
L:  That's what I look for.
R:  -- we just [LAUGH] throw the rest -- you know, and my parents are like, "Ah, do you not read that?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  And we're like, "Mm, no" [LAUGH] you know, and they're like, "Ah, we will".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Well, take it home with you because I'm --"
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  "-- going to throw it in the trash".  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  But ...
L:  My husband will try to -- will usually try to get through it.  He -- he --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- gets -- catches the paper at work, um, a lot of times.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But sometimes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when he comes home at lunch he'll -- he'll look through it.  And [SIGH] I do --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- like to do it but I have to have a rule of [MN] stacking 'em up, and just -- you know, putting them in the [LAUGH] recycling bag --
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- because they start accumulating around my house.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  Because I did just get the weekend paper [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, but then I n- noticed that I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- became an a- avid coupon shopper and try to --
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- try to shop for the [LAUGH] d- deals [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- to try to ... work with the budget.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and like different days of the week, different stores have their ads in there so that's what I did.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  Yeah.  Well, that's it -- usually I mean if my husband has time he'll get the sports section out of it.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But that's [SIGH] -- I mean the ... most out of -- you know, like, I get the coupons and the [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, part of it and you know, those kind of ads but other than that it's [NOISE] [SIGH] right into the bin it goes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  We don't read much.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  But, um, no, other than that, I don't know what else would be current events [SIGH] you know?
L:  I know.
R:  Other than, you know, the TV is [MN] -- you know, whatever is on the TV ... like, you know, watching it in the mornings for [SIGH] the weather --
L:  Weather.
R:  -- and [NOISE] --
L:  It's amazing how, um, -- how I -- I guess like that kind of changed [SIGH] when we were very close [SIGH] to the sniper attacks --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- outside of Washington DC.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Do you remember hearing about those --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- last October?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  They're actually two here in our home town.  [MN]
R:  Oh, my gosh!  Uh-huh.
L:  Places that I regularly go and we were there [LAUGH] on both days [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that they happened here.
R:  Oh, my gosh!  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  So, it was very scary but it -- it was amazing how -- how much news you tried to consume.  Like we watched CNN [MN] um, a- all the time --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- av- avidly.  We tried to keep the kids, like, in the other room but we wanted to know --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] who was where and what was going on and, um --
R:  Yeah, like you know --
L:  -- any type of detail --
R:  -- you're checking everything.  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- any type of detail.  So, we did.  I know I read the paper a lot.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, at that time it was good to have.
R:  Uh-hum.  Wow!  That would be [NOISE] r- really freaky.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it --
R:  [MN]  Wow!  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, it's amaz- -- i- it seems like so long ago now --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it totally [SIGH] disrupted o- our lives so bad, like, I -- when -- when it was over I felt like I could br- -- it was almost like you couldn't breath.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, like, going outside you just -- y- you didn't want to do it.  I mean [SIGH] I -- I live kind of in a wooded area and I never had, um, curtains on my windows --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we'd only been here for ... a couple of years but [SIGH] you know, I went out and bought curtains 'cause --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you never when --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- [SIGH] whether they could be going through neighborhoods or ...
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] it -- it was just, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  I could [SIGH] but then again I could kind of understand, you know -- like all the -- the terrorism that's going on, um, [LIPSMACK] overseas now, ah, you know, the bombings and stuff and how --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- they live with that every day about the bus they get on could it get bombed --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- by somebody?
R:  -- Uh-huh.  Uh-hum.
L:  And b- being through that for, I guess it was -- it was about a four and a half, five week ordeal [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you were like, "I've -- I've got to -- to go out.  I've got to go to the grocery store".  I mean you just, i- if it happens it happens but --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you just can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stay inside any longer.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, [SIGH] and I didn't like to take the kids with me but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on, ah, [SIGH] the one that -- the shooting that happened at a gas station just about two miles from our house, I was on my way [SIGH] south that day and, um -- and I was going to -- I had just called my mom and I said, "Hey, I'm going to go ahead and get [SIGH] gas" before y- you know, before I -- I pick her up.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] and I was putting my s- shoes on -- my shoes and my kids' and my, um, sister in law called and said there was t- the shooting at that particular gas station.  [SIGH]  So, we were --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  -- we were like within ... a couple of minutes of being there.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  Oh, my gosh!  That gives you [NOISE] goose bumps.  [LAUGH]
L:  It does.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- a shooting th- -- that happened a couple of weeks earlier, [SIGH] um, it was outside a Michael's Store and I was at a --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- furniture store right beside it, but I was parked in the same row of the van --
R:  Oh!  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and I was there at eleven thirty and the shooting happened at two thirty.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, my God!
L:  And that kind of stuff just makes you think of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, i- i- i- -- what if, but how life is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so short and the different --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- things that you do.  [SIGH]  It's just [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I don't know it does, it gives you chills.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it does.  I've got, like, goose bumps on my arms and my legs.  [LAUGH]
L:  But it was just amazing how so many people had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stories like that.  They were in some way connected --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to [SIGH] the particular --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- place it happened, you know, they were --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- like, "Well, I was getting gas at that gas station yesterday at the exact same time" [SIGH] or --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- that sort of thing.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- which really hits you --
R:  Holy cow!
L:  -- [SIGH] 'cause, um, ...
R:  A- ah, yeah, I mean, um, that would be, you know, just like [SIGH] -- like, when the, um, September Eleventh thing --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- or whatever, 'cause I know you had said like, you know, you watched the TV or whatever [SIGH] and it's like something, you know, when it's something really, really big ... then, you know, like when the --
