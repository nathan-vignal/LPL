R:  Hi.  
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Diane.
L:  Well, I'm Vicky.
R:  Hi, Vicky, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Ah, how do we get our current events?  Okay, how do you get yours?
L:  Um, mostly I think over the internet.
R:  Oh, that's interesting, oh.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  I do a lot over the internet and then I listen to the radio.
L:  Okay. [NOISE]
R:  But I don't listen to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- T.V. much, unless it's something really important, like about the war or something like that.
L:  Right, I don't either.
R:  And then I'll watch television.  But I wake up to, like, W.J.N. in the morning --
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  -- and every half hour they give you -- are you from Chicago?
L:  No, I'm from Indiana.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, W.J.N. gives you, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every half hour they give you the news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So while I'm lingering in the morning, I'll listen to the news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and see what's going on in Chicago and in the world.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And they're pretty good about giving you the highlights. 
L:  Right.
R:  And sometimes I buy the paper too.
L:  Okay --
R:  If it's interesting.
L:  I don't do that but will sometimes will read my local paper online.
R:  Oh --
L:  So ...
R:  -- you can read your local paper online too?
L:  Mhm.  I think most of 'em you can. 
R:  Oh --
L:  I think so.
R:  -- oh.  Wow.
L:  I think you just go to something like newspapers dot com and pick your state and your city and I think almost all papers these days are online. 
R:  Oh, that's great.  You know, I -- I know I looked at [inaudible].  I know, um, what is it, um, I know the New York Times is online.
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  That I know for sure.  And I think the Wall Street Journal is, and I get, um, I -- I do a lot of, um, stock markets, check the stock markets and what they're doing a lot online. 
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And th- -- you find out a lot about the business news that way. 
L:  Right. 
R:  You know, and to see how the stocks are doing and how they're not doing.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I check the weather quite a bit online.  If I wanna know -- I should have checked it today --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] but I didn't, ah, but that's what I do most of the time and then, ah, I always buy the Sunday paper though.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Because to me, it has a lot of the ads and it has a lot of the, um, features and you get your T.V. guide in it --
L:  That's true, yeah. 
R:  And -- and we have a section called Metro --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the Chicago Tribune and it's, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] it gives, like, a week of what's happening -- some of the things that's happened during the -- in the city.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and they have the classifieds and the real estate, you know, all that.  
L:  Right.
R:  But the classifieds are very thin.
L:  Are they?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh. 
R:  Very thin. 
L:  Kinda, um, high unemployment?
R:  Yeah, we have the high unemployment in Chicago, we've lost more jobs than any other city in the country. 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because we had [inaudible] Anderson and we had, um, you know, United and we had M.C.I. and all those. 
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  We had some really big companies that went under.
L:  I see. 
R:  Yeah, so it's been kinda bad here [inaudible]. 
L:  It does, it sounds like it.  I'm in kind of a small town close to Fort Wayne in Indiana --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's a small city.
R:  Do they have a newspaper of their own?
L:  Yes. 
R:  Does it come out daily?
L:  It does. 
R:  Oh, that's interesting --
L:  It's only since that we've been having, ah, a Sunday paper though.  It's a pretty small town.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  But, yeah, now we do have a daily paper.
R:  Oh, well that's good.  Then you get all the news of the day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, a little bitty town.
L:  Yeah, and still with local news and I like that too.
R:  Mhm.  And then what -- what paper do you use for your, ah, current events, what do you look at, the one in Fort Lauderda- -- ah, ah, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Wayne?
L:  I do sometimes look at the one in Fort Wayne.  Yeah, it's called the, ah, Journal Gazette.
R:  Oh, see, we have the, um, Tribune here and the Sun Times --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and we have a reader that's a free paper, that has a lot of, like, classifieds and stuff like that in it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then they started these two new papers, they're called the Red Eye and the Red Star, I think.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they're, ah, for people -- they geared to, like, people twenties and thirties.
L:  Mm.
R:  They just have, like, an outline in what's going on.  I mean it's, like, twenty five cents and it's got, like, maybe -- you can read it to work -- on your way to work. 
L:  Oh.
R:  It's, like, ah, a flash of [MN] current events.  
L:  Oh, I see. 
R:  Yeah, yeah, so it's kinda interesting, you know.
L:  On your way to work do you take a, ah, bus or ...?
R:  I take the rapid transit. 
L:  Oh, okay, see, we don't have anything like that in my c- -- my town's too small. 
R:  Oh, yeah, really and truly.
L:  Yeah, you could read the paper on the way to work then, couldn't you?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you could -- everybody -- lots of people take the rapid transit here because, ah, it's a lot faster than driving.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, how big is your paper, for the little town you're in?
L:  It's usually just has, um, two section, one section will have the main stories and the -- the n- -- world news, local news, and then the other section will have sports and classifieds.
R:  Now, do you have to pay for this?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  I just thought maybe it was a free thing they were doing.
L:  No, I think it's fifty cents daily and a dollar on Sunday. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [inaudible] it costs for the day.  I don't subscribe to it, so I don't know how much it comes out to --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- if you do it that way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but normally I read it online. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. 
L:  That's what I normally do. 
R:  Oh, that's even online, huh?
L:  Mhm.  Yep.  Even our local one, they update it every day.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know.  That that's online. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Huh.  Oh well, I guess everything's online now --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  And I talk to friends of mine on an instant message -- messenger and down at the bottom of the instant messenger are, um, headlines that will come up.  Entertainment, or otherwise, you know, worlds news or entertainment news -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- will flash up, like, three little facts at a time and you can click on one and it'll open a window, and I get a lot of it that way.  It'll just tell me, you know, a big headline and I'll -- I'll open it up. 
R:  Oh, okay.  That's interesting, you know it.  Oh, see, I don't, um -- see I don't -- I have my own computer, but I don't -- I'm at work all day and they don't like us, you know, being, ah, how can I say it -- being on the internet a whole lot.
L:  Oh, from work. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, yeah, you can understand that.
L:  Oh, sure. 
R:  They're not --
L:  You do that from home, yeah.
R:  -- really big on that at all, you know.
L:  And do --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- do you have one at home?
R:  [LIPSMACK] And when I get home, like, it's late --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and most of the time I don't bother doing it --
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I just try to pick up whatever news it is and then, oh, something comes to mind, if something's going on exciting, they'll tell me too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so that's kinda like how I get most of my news.  Believe me, if it's important you find out.
L:  That is true.
R:  I mean, you know, like, when the World Trade Centre hit, boy, everybody was banging --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- up their phones.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I'm saying.  And that went on the internet immediately.  
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause I did -- I did go on the internet with that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm trying to think about how else I get my news.  Mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  This is long to talk for ten minutes, isn't it?
L:  I know. [LAUGH]  And I'm not much of a talker, I'm more of a listener, so it kind of --
R:  How -- how -- yeah.
L:  -- I -- I'm making it harder on you. [LAUGH] 
R:  How long have you be- -- is this the first time you did this?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, this is the second time I did it.  I haven't got my check yet though. [several inaudible words]
L:  I kind of wondered.  It would be worth it if you really did, but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've kinda, you know, you don't always believe everything you hear.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I thought it was worth a try. 
R:  Yeah, that's how I think of --
L:  See what happens.
R:  -- I think it did it, like, two weeks ago, I think.
L:  Oh. 
R:  [several inaudible words] I don't know if we're supposed to be talking like that --
L:  I know.
R:  -- at all, but that's okay. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No -- no -- I guess [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, but, um, I'm trying to think about  --
L:  I don't either, what else --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- I -- I -- I -- I'll say something.  I'm a school bus driver, so I listen sometimes to the radio.  Usually I listen to books on tape when I'm by myself, or when I have the kids on we listen to the radio, so I do hear of news that way too.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay, so they have a scho- -- on -- on the bus they have a radio?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, at work I don't have a radio --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I don't get to hear any of the news during the day.  It's only in the evening and after, um [LIPSMACK] oh, like, I say most of the time I catch it in the morning, well, before I get to work.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I -- oh, another thing is, a lot of times I'll be going down the street and I see a lot of the headlines, you know, they have the big headlines in Chicago --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in the Sun Times and that.  And if it's something I really wanna read, I'll pick that up -- I'll buy the paper and buy it.  But I don't have my paper delivered --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because people steal it in Chicago. 
L:  Oh, no. 
R:  Yeah, believe it or not.  They'll steal your paper.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  That's terrible. 
R:  Yeah, it is terrible.  It really --
L:  Like some --
R:  -- is.
L:  -- do you live in a house or an apartment?
R:  I live in apartment. 
L:  So, like, they put it in your hallway and then someone --
R:  We don't have --
L:  -- [inaudible]? 
R:  -- our hallways are locked. 
L:  Oh.
R:  See.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so, ah, they just take it. 
L:  Hm.
R:  It's outside and they just take it.
L:  Wow, that weird.  I wouldn't -- 
R:  And you --
L:  -- do it either.
R:  -- don't have a paper left. 
L:  Hm.
R:  You know, and that causes a problem, you know.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And I don't wanna be calling them and complaining all the time. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I just take in, um -- if I'm interested I buy it. 
L:  Right.
R:  But that how I get it most of the time. 
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.  I just, ah, and then my mom, she keeps up pretty close to what's going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she gives me the news. 
L:  Mm.
R:  You know.
L:  Right.
R:  Pretty much and then if there's something really exciting someone -- you'll find -- like I said before, you'll find out.
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  You know.  But that's about how I do it.  You know, I guess there's a lot more news in Chicago that there is where you are.
L:  I bet so.  A lot more --
R:  You know.
L:  -- local news.  That's for sure.
R:  Yeah, we have a lot more local news, a lot more problems, I guess.
L:  Mhm, luckily around here there's never anything in -- I mean I'm not complaining. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no, don't complain.
L:  But in my town, you don't hear about anything.  You know, maybe, um, car accident or somebody bo- -- you know, breaking someone's car window, that's about as bad as it ever gets. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  We're really blessed. 
R:  You are.  You --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really are, because we have a lot of problems here. 
L:  Now, at Fort Wayne, I'm only about twenty miles away and they have everything, you know. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  All the bad stuff, but thankfully it has not reached here.  
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you don't have a whole lot of news?
L:  No, it's always just really minor stuff. 
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We have, um, we have a lot of stuff here, a lot.  There's always something going on.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- what I mean.  And, um, I'm trying to think if there's any other way I get news.
