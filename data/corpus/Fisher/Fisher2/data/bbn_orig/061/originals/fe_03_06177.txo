L:  [NOISE]
R: [NOISE] Hello?
L:  She'll be right with you.  Hello.  Hi.
R: Hi.
L:  My name's Julia.
R: My name's Alexis, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R: Good.
L:  Well, uh, you wanna begin? [LAUGH]  H- how do y- --
R: Where -- where do you live?
L:  I live in, uh, Tampa, Florida.
R: Oh, okay, as you say --
L:  Actually, Tarpons[?] --
R:  -- you sound like -- I thought you were the person I talked to last time but I guess not.
L:  No.  Where -- how about -- where do y- you live?
R: I'm from Altoona, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh okay.  Wow.
R: Okay.
L:  Okay, I've heard of that before.  Actually, I'm originally from O- --
R: You have?  Wow, that's crazy.
L:  Yeah, actually I'm fr- originally from Ohio, but --
R: Oh, okay.
L:  -- anyway, uh, current events, uh --
R: Current events, I --
L:  From --
R: -- don't keep current on them, so, uh, this is --
L:  Yeah --
R: -- kinda weird.
L:  -- to tell you the truth, I, um, I -- I kinda go in sporadically, you know, sometimes I keep real close and then I go for a while and I don't care.
R: Mhm.
L:  And then I get up with 'em, but I would say for me it's probably more, uh, television.
R: Television, yeah.
L:  As far as, uh, listening, you know, CNN or local -- local news for me, you know.
R: Yeah.
L:  A Tam- -- we have a Tampa Bay station, which is Channel Eight, and, uh --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I do get the nor- -- the, um, daily paper, which is a -- for us is the, uh, Saint Pete Times.  We have two papers.  I get that, but --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes I don't even read that every day, I'm, you know, I, you know, scan --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- it, you know, several times a week, but, um --
R: Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] and I -- and I get other magazines and things but, you know, keeping up with them is, uh, is somewhat of a [LAUGH], you know, a hit and miss I guess is what --
R: Mhm.
L:  -- what we'll say.  And, um, I -- I'm not working presently.  I was but I'm -- I've been off work for some time so I -- I did listen to, um, you know, some news channels on the way to work, which, you know, kinda kept me, uh, they tend to repeat themselves after about --
R: [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- fifteen minutes you've got all the news, so I used to do that, but, um --
R: Yeah.
L:  So, how about you?  Uh, when you were listening to it more, sound like you --
R: Well, uh, I -- I'm a college student --
L:  Okay.
R: -- so, um --
L:  You're busy with college. [LAUGH]
R: Right, uh, yeah.  And like, I don't always watch TV, I just watch what I wanna watch on TV.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R: So, I don't know, like, when the whole thing that in Iraq happened I didn't really know what was going on, my -- my one friend actually told me exactly everything that's going on.
L:  Okay.
R: I would watch a little bit, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R: So I'd -- I'd just get -- I -- it was always getting it in classes, like, I'd get updated or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R: Um, a lot of times when you sign on America Online they have like, current issue- -- you know, in news --
L:  Okay.
R: -- and stuff like that.
L:  Okay.
R: But, I mean, it's hardly --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- news, okay?  'Cause they -- they just take current events, you know, like --
L:  Right.
R: -- news --
L:  That's true.
R: -- like, stuff like government [inaudible].  I don't really care about that.
L:  Yeah.
R: I don't know.  I keep updated with it [LAUGH] but I don't really care about it.
L:  Well, it's -- it's hard to k- --
R: But -- but like --
L:  [MN]
R: -- stories like -- like, I don't know, like that Lacey Peterson thing.
L:  Right.
R: I've been reading a lot about that, like, I just read a article in a magazine today about that.
L:  Okay.
R: And, I don't know, I just keep -- I just keep updated, I go with the flow of, you know, if people are talking about it join in the conversation, find out what's going on.
L:  Yeah.
R: If you're online and you see something that looks interesting, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- read a little bit about it.
L:  Well, you --
R: You see something on TV --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- you catch -- catch that.  So I j- -- I just kinda go with the flow like --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- pick up --
L:  Well, you bring --
R: -- stuff.
L:  -- up a good point 'cause I do the same, you're like there's maybe something in it sorta like takes my interest or something and --
R: Right.  If it peaks your interest, right.
L:  -- I find it interesting, then I might read it or I might, like you said, sort of pay more attention to it or sorta --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, go a little bit further and, um, listening or reading it or something else, just some --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- particular person or cur- you know, event or whatever it is.
R: [NOISE]
L:  So that's, um --
R: Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I don't know, somehow, whatever it is that catches attention in certain, uh --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, person --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- uh.  I don't know.  Lately I got into this -- I haven't been watching --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- this, uh, American Idol and my husband's got --
R: Oh, I'm hooked on American Idol.
L:  [LAUGH] I, uh, I wasn't watching it, I kept thinking, "Oh, this is so stupid, it's so slow, I don't wanna watch it" and then finally, [inaudible] that, you know, there's this one guy he wanted me to watch, you know, 'cause my husband's from Alabama and it had this Rudy on here.  I'm, okay, okay, I fin- --
R: Ruben, yeah.
L:  Ruben, Ruben, okay.  And I finally, "Okay, I'll watch it.  I'll watch it one time, okay?"  'Cause if I'd -- I had to watch it once before and I didn't -- I -- for like, five minutes and I didn't like the person, I said, "Okay, this is stupid, you know, I know".  And then I thought, "Well, huh, it's pretty good" you know.  So --
R: Uh-huh.
L:  -- now I've been watching it, you know, and --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- and so it is kinda [LAUGH], you know, it's, you know, it does kinda get ya, [MN] I'm --
R: Gets ya hooked!
L:  -- kinda into now, now that they're --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- uh, [several inaudible words] down and now they're down to the finalists or something it's --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- a little better, you know, but, um, so it -- and it's kinda different, you know?
R: Yeah.
L:  And it's kinda fun, you know.  It's, uh --
R: Yeah, that's --
L:  -- not their --
R: -- and that's current, you know --
L:  So --
R: -- for an event.
L:  Yeah.
R: [inaudible].  'Cause this will -- this person will be the most famous person in America when they get --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- when they win, you know.
L:  Yeah.  So that's kinda something, you know, you're kinda want to follow 'em, I mean, they're [MN] it's sort of in some of the magazines and things like that, so, um, but, uh, you know, and for a while there I was really following what was going on with the war and everything --
R: War.
L:  -- and, you know, obviously it was, um, of -- of, you know --
R: Yeah.
L:  --  some interest and now I've kind of peaked off since they, you know, seemed to have --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- uh, um, you know, succeeded --
R: But it's weird --
L:  -- in what they wanted to do, but --
R: It's weird is that I was at my sister's college graduation --
L:  [COUGH]
R: -- this weekend and one of the speakers mentioned like, the recent bombings that were going on or something, like --
L:  Hm.
R: -- tests.  And I knew nothing about it, like, I didn't know --
L:  Right.
R: -- he was.  So then I like, after where it was like, I asked my friend, like, you know, what was going on?  And he said they were doing like, tests or something for ...
L:  Hm.
R: -- military matters or something.  I didn't really know --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R: -- like, in Chicago or somewhere like that.
L:  Yeah, I heard something about that and I don't know what, again I just caught a -- caught a, um, piece of that somewhere, and I think there was something on Sixty Minutes or something, but, um, um, but I -- yeah, it's funny 'cause you mentioned college and I'm probably not that much older than you but I -- I can remember when I was in college too and it's like, you know, you're right, you don't have, I mean, [LAUGH] it's like, what you hear from a friend or what you, you know --
R: Right, right.
L:  -- what you pick up in classroom or, you know, it's not -- you know, you have so much work to do just --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- doing your homework and --
R: Right.
L:  -- various things, it's not like you -- even though they tell ya, "Oh yeah, you should be up on everything" it's virtually impossible [LAUGH] you know!  So unless the teacher brings something up or you're forced to read something or, you know, you just happen to get it, it's, um, it's pretty tough.
R: Mm.
L:  You get s- -- you get so much other work to do, but, um [SIGH], so, I don't know.  Yeah, I mean, I -- I've done about every different kind of thing at one time or another, you know.  I mean --
R: Right.
L:  -- I've gotten all the different kinds of magazines at one time and another and I just kind of, um, I find them all hard to keep up with on a -- on a -- on a constant basis, any of 'em [LAUGH], you know.
R: Yeah.
L:  So, you know, I drop --
R: I too, ma--- my main --
L:  -- I drop off and it just -- it gets overwhelming.
R: My main resource is people.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R: Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R: My main resource is people, that's what I mean.
L:  That's probably a -- a good thing and, um, I don't know for me, I guess it's probably the news.  I'm kind of more, um, um, I've been pretty much, uh, inside.  I'm, um, worked on some research and, um, things like that.  I'm actually working on my disquisition and, uh --
R: Mm.
L:  So I'm kind of, uh, not out a lot. [LAUGH]  Not --
R: Yeah.
L:  Not really, oh, out around a lot of people a lot and been just kinda hibernating so to speak, but --
R: Hm.
L:  -- um, [MN] so I don't get it --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- don't see as many people but, um, that's probably where I'm catching the news, but, um --
R: Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] I don't know, I guess -- so lately maybe it's more the news for me, or my husband who --
R: Mhm.
L:  -- whether there's the person who is around more people who, you know, hears something from someone or --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- or catches it on the radio or something like that.
R: Mhm.
L:  And, um, um, you know, like, say once in a while I get something from the paper or -- or, you know, local -- local s- uh, news station, but I usually don't just sit in front of it and watch it, you know, I just like, turn it on if it's -- it happens to be that time.  A lot of times I don't even [COUGH], you know, it's not a -- I'm not there at that time that it's on, I don't, you know, necessarily, you know, make a point of being there to see it --
R: Right.
L:  -- at six o'clock.  And lately I haven't even -- you know, it hasn't been the time that I'm in front of it -- front of it, so I haven't even been catching that but --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- um, so, I don't know.  [LAUGH] You know, it's [LAUGH] --
R: Yeah.
L:  So, um --
R: I don't know.
L:  I don't know.
R: [NOISE] It's --
L:  You know, it --
R: I think also that it all depends on like, your lifestyle, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R: Like you were saying.  Definitely depends on like, what type of person you are and like, what you do, like, whether, you know, whether you're a student, whether you're an adult, what you go to college, you have a career --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- you're a young person in high school, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R: I think that also depends on a lot of like how you hear your news. [NOISE]  'Cause classes are --
L:  Y- yeah.
R: -- a good resource, you know, school.
L:  Yeah, they are, actually they -- they bring up a lot of things in class.
R: Yeah.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] then you bring up the good point about the Internet.  I -- I still, um, you know, I've emailed [inaudible] but I -- I'm not using +AOL -- AOL anymore but, um, you know, I do use, um --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] end up using, um --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- Internet Explorer or so --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- a -- a lot of times, like you said, something will pop up there --
R: Pop up on -- yeah.
L:  -- that, um, so you're right, you are getting bombarded, and I still get tons of stuff in email, although a lot of it's not really news related.  Some of it's, um, product related.  Um, but it's -- you know, some of it could, um, maybe considered somewhat current event.  Sometimes it -- it gets -- some of it may be current events, um, hinging on the, you know, on the patriotic or something like that or
