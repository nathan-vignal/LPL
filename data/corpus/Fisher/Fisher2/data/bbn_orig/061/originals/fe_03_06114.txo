R:  Hi, I'm Joy.
L:  Hi, Arlene.
R:  Okay, um, how do you get your news usually?
L:  I get my news -- I read just about every daily, I mean, every newspaper in my city which is Philadelphia.  I read the Enquirer, the new-, um, US Today, the daily news and I also listen -- I mean, I also look at the news.
R:  Well, I -- I read the newspaper from cover to cover but I also, um, keep up with CNN and, um, the other, uh, satellite stations.
L:  And I get my news -- I also go online.  If I don't get my paper delivered.  If they happen to don't deliver my paper I go online and get the, um, you know, news that's happening.  Like right with CNN and everything like that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sort of current events.  What are -- where are you from anyway?  
R:  Uh, Austin, Texas.
L:  Oh, Austin, Texas.  
R:  I --
L:  Oh, the weather out there should be nice, huh?
R:  Oh, it's hot.
L:  It's hot?  
R:  We're having a cold front tomorrow and it's gonna be eighty six which will be lovely.  We been right at a hundred, hundred and two.
L:  Oh, a hundred and two.  Oh, my god.
R:  And it's not even June yet.  We're gonna have a hot summer.
L:  Oh, but the current events.  Wh- what is going on in Texas?
R:  Well, right now we're fighting a -- a -- a -- we've got a Robin Hood [inaudible] on our school system where the wealthier districts end up paying [SIGH] the poor districts a portion of their, uh, taxes and, uh, we're unfortunately are in a wealthier district, even though we're not wealthy.
L:  Right.
R:  And we're gonna have to pay twenty million into the pot that's coming out of our funds and they're talking about shutting down, uh, golf and tennis and track and all the team s- --
L:  Athletic, um, sports and stuff.
R:  Well, they're -- they're leaving football alone.  You know, football down here is sacred and they're not gonna do a thing about baseball or the other things but it's -- mainly it's like the sports that the girls go out for they're gonna cut.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I think we may have a Title Nine fight.  You know what Title Nine is? 
L:  No, what is that?
R:  Title Nine is, uh, when they came up with a law and said, uh, the girls have to be given equal opportunity to play sports.
L:  Oh, just as well as the boys.
R:  Yeah, if there's gonna be a boys' basketball team, there needs to be a girls' basketball team.
L:  Oh, so they have to be equal?  Oh, that makes sense.
R:  Yeah, so I --
L:  'Cause of before they was discriminating, right?
R:  That's right.
L:  Do you have any children that play sports?
R:  I have a daughter on the golf team.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  She just hit varsity and I have two boys that are gonna start high school but they'll be in ROTC.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, they won't be on a -- a sporting team.
L:  That's for like the service -- like Army and stuff; ROTC?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's a Air Force branch but they can chose any branch they wanna go into.
L:  Oh.
R:  But they're thinking when they get out of school that that's what they'll do to go ahead and get the money for their college education 'cause things are tight down here.
L:  Oh, so they taking the money out of their tax payers.  That's what you saying?  The tax payers is --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- are gonna have to pay for all this.
R:  Well, they just increased our taxes six hundred dollars this year and we're gonna have to pay activity fees for each kid.
L:  And you have three?
R:  I have three.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  That's gonna hit you --
R:  So, that'll be another three hundred dollars plus, you know, the things for the sport and then our s- -- you know, in football they pay for the jerseys and they pay for your pants.  They pay for everything.
L:  In football.
R:  And -- and in -- in basketball it's that way.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And golf you pay everything.
L:  Oh, so your -- none of your children is into sports where they pay for everything, right?  Your daughter's in golf.
R:  No, we -- we have to -- it comes out of our pocket to pay for it.
L:  How's your daughter doing?
R:  She's now on the varsity and she shot a eighty eight last week which is pretty good.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, you go out to all her games?
R:  Well, not all of 'em but I do go.  Uh, sometimes I make it about nine holes.  When I do eighteen, you know, it's like six miles.  It just about kills me but I can do three.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, uh --
L:  So, is your daughter the oldest or the youngest?
R:  Yeah, she's the eldest.  She'll be a senior this next year.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And the other thing I wanted to talk to you about was our current economy.  You know, that's -- that's the current news on what our economy is.  I -- I think we need, uh, reign in the republicans a little bit and say, "Quit spending so much money".
L:  Right, that's what I'm saying.
R:  Our kids are gonna be paying for --
L:  Well, w- w- --
R:  It's not gonna be us paying for this.  Our kids are gonna be in debt until they die.
L:  Our kids gonna be in debt and when you reach re-, um, retirement age who's -- there's not gonna be any money left for anybody to retire.
R:  That's right.  I've already told my husband, "Forget social security".
L:  Right, that's what I'm talking about.
R:  And I said that I'm probably gonna be working doing something when I'm --
L:  A- over your -- over sixty five.
R:  -- older.  I said there won't be a retirement.  We'll -- we'll just work until we die.
L:  Right.  And then forget, like you said, forget the children because they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They gotta get where we are already.
R:  Yeah, and luckily my daughter will probably get, uh, scholastic scholarships but my sons are average students so I don't know about them.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't think they're gonna get the scholarships that she would get [inaudible] --
L:  At least they're going into something with the ROTC.  That's something positive.
R:  Yeah, and -- and, uh, that way the Air Force, or whatever they go into, will help 'em.  And, uh, so at least they got a chance.
L:  Well, what do you think about the war --
R:  They --
L:  -- that this was over?  That was, uh, it was current now but it's --
R:  I think -- I think the war was poorly done.
L:  Do you think it was a waste of money?  Taxpayers --
R:  I th- -- I think we should've gone over there like gang busters with more people then we would've been able to better control it instead of trying to act like we were, you know, Houdini.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think a -- a lot of the things have happened -- happened simply because we didn't have enough people t- to take care of it once we were over there.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think we could've lot done, you know, like, um, I don't know it was just like when we after Osama -- Osama Bin Laden.  We didn't finish it.  But --
L:  Did you have any relatives that we- -- had to go over? [NOISE] Did you have any --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- relatives like brothers or sisters or --
R:  No, I just happen- -- my brother in law had just retired from the Air Force and he was in intelligence and he thought they might call him up but they didn't.
L:  Oh, okay for like e- --
R:  So, I -- but I do have, uh, friends whose kids went and, uh, some of my personal friends, you know, their kids went over there.  But --
L:  How did you find out --
R:  I just happened to fa- -- kind of fall between the cracks this time.
L:  How did you find out about this Fisher, um, project right here?
R:  Uh, through Money and Shopping.
L:  Oh, do -- how long have you been, um, with them?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Money and Shopping?  Only about three days.
L:  Oh, so you been c- -- talking to people for three days?
R:  Well, this is just -- this is my third call but, uh, I, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I wanted to make some money and when your kids are at home during the summer you kind of, you know, like my daughter's gonna be in a lot -- she's gonna be in eight golf tournaments this summer --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- plus she's taking economics.
L:  So, you need that extra cash.
R:  And so I need the time to haul her around.  I'm the chauffeur.  
L:  Oh, you the chauffeur for b- -- your b- -- um, your boys is like in -- is not into sports you said they into --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the RO thing.  But your daughter --
R:  But I'm still the one driving 'em around and, um, [LIPSMACK] I needed something that I could make some money but yet at the same time that I could control it.  That -- that --
L:  You can control it.  That's the best thing about this.  You can control it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You told 'em the time and everything like five or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- five thirty, something like that is a good time for you.
R:  Well, this time I just called in and decided I'd do it on the call 'cause I wasn't here earlier.
L:  Oh, you usually go earlier, in the morning?
R:  Yeah, I usually do it about three but I just thought I'd call in and get it done.  This'll -- this'll be my third call on this so I'll -- I won't be able to call any more.  But, uh --
L:  Oh, they only allow you three calls?
R:  That's what they've told us.
L:  Oh, they didn't tell me that.  This is --
R:  What --
L:  Well, this would be my third call also.  I did not know that.
R:  Well, they may have changed the rules 'cause they're redoing it too and I'll just wait to see the emails 'cause I think this is my third.  But they just gave me a -- they said that they would only pay for three calls.
L:  Oh, that's what they said?
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  But it's ten b- -- ten dollars a pop.  It's an easy ten dollars.
L:  Ten dollars and well there's a check for like what, thirty dollars when it come in the mail?
R:  Yeah, so it'll -- it'll --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- come in handy.
L:  Oh.  Well, your --
R:  It'll buy a few hamburgers or whatever.
L:  Well, right.  What you think for the children, right?  Pizzas, hamburgers.
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  So, you looking forward to that cold front, you said?
R:  Well, it's not really gonna be much of a front but if it'll drop it down ten degrees we'll all be excited about it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  'Cause right --
L:  Well, what do you all do to --
R:  -- now it's so hot and humid you can't hardly get outside without just going, "Ah".  You can't hardly breathe and feeling --
L:  That's what I'm saying.  Basically you have to stay in during the day like when it's --
R:  Yeah, I get out during the morning but in the afternoon I just try to stay -- stay in.
L:  What air conditioners and -- and fans and --
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's too hot to be out there in the evening.
L:  I know you don't have your no animals out.  Do you have animals, pets?
R:  We -- I have a cat but it stays inside and aggravates me all the time.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] And so --
R:  It's got us well trained.
L:  Oh.
R:  But an- an- -- well let's get back on current events.  Uh, what do you think about, uh, like the -- the recent tax cut?  I don't think that's gonna do us any good.
L:  No, it's not.  I don't --
R:  And I -- and I feel that the rich just get richer and they keep their money in their pocket.  They don't spend it.
L:  That's what I'm saying.  They steal from -- take from the poor and make the rich richer.  That's what I say.  'Cause, um --
R:  Well, I think we agree on that.
L:  -- we have election -- we have election going on over here tomorrow for like re electing, um, you know, it's the primary for like the, um, mayor and all different, um, council.  You know, representatives --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  We ha-
