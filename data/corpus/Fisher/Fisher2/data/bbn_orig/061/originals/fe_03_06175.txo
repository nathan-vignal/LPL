R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  This is Shirley.
L:  This is Soundary.
R:  I didn't catch your name.
L:  Soundary.
R:  Soundary?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh.  I talk with you?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.  How are you doing?
R:  Oh, pretty good.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so how do you get most of your news?
L:  Um, [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] I guess I actually get m- a lot of my news from the Web.  Um, my friends [LIPSMACK] check CNN a lot and, um, [LIPSMACK] I tend to look at the Web pages when I have time.  I think I'm actually not that good at keeping up with current events unfortunately, as much as I would like to be.
R:  I think that, yeah, I get mine in the bright[?] -- always I mention --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just depending on what's going on.  I mean, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Nine eleven, you know, someone calls and you rush to the TV and that's all you do. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I remember when they were, um, but [SIGH] -- DC area sniper shooting, they really didn't tell ya as much as you wanted to know so then run to the Web and find out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But so, I guess it just depends. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I do, um, get some news from the TV and just, I guess, word of mouth when talking with someone about a ch- particular story, then sometimes I'm motivated to go learn more about it, either by watching something on TV about it or reading something on the Web -- Web about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, where are you -- what location are you in?
R:  In Pennsylvania.
L:  Pennsylvania?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, so the news stations I think probably are western or eastern?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, 'cause the news -- I think the news stations in tri state, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania area, are good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'm in Virginia and sometimes the news isn't as, uh -- the local news isn't as informative as you would like. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My father has, um -- we don't have cable here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  We -- guess we could but we live out in the country and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, when we go into his house --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- we watch more news. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  'Cause it's more interesting and so ...
L:  Right.
R:  They give you a lot faster, I guess.
L:  Mhm.  Do you read any news magazines?
R:  No.  No.  No.  Once in a while --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'll read the headlines of the newspaper but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I rarely go through a newspaper and see what -- all they had to say.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, sometimes I'll leaf through magazines when I'm at a friend's house and they have a particular magazine and ...  [LIPSMACK] I'll look through it but I don't have any subscriptions to anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The Time or Newsweek or ... [LIPSMACK] [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE]
R:  Huh, um, hm.
L:  What -- have there been particular stories you've been following right now?
R:  Um, no.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't think -- I'm not really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, the ... lotta times but there's been so many different ones lately that it's really hard to pick up on just one like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the terrorist, um, activities and the l- -- the recent bombings and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, the terrible weather that's been going on this spring.
L:  No kidding.
R:  That it's so hard to focus on one because the next thing you know there's just another one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The tornadoes and [SIGH] -- and the -- all those, um, [LIPSMACK] suicide bombers, it's just -- you sorta lose track after a while just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH].
L:  It almost becomes overwhelming to really follow [LAUGH] -- follow it closely.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Uh, [MN] I do often check on the Web to see if I've missed anything big. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I -- I don't watch the news every day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On TV.
L:  Right.
R:  Mm. [LIPSMACK]
L:  And it's almost like they report, I mean, I don't know, I feel like sometimes the news -- I feel like the news has gotten less serious in some ways in the sense that they report on entertainment so much now and not as much about pol- -- like, I mean, I -- I guess -- or maybe they're just covering everything more now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not actually like they report on, you know, TV shows and [LAUGH] different things where you would want the news to report on, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- government situations or something more substantial.  And I feel like even the serious news papers have r- -- you know, report on other TV instead of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, does that make any sense?
R:  Yeah, I think that [several inaudible words] sometimes they have these little petty things going on and you just wanna hear something serious.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then it can be overwhelming too, when it's so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so much, um -- when you hear so many negative -- negative things, it can become overwhelming I think.
R:  Yes, it [inaudible].  I guess there are bigger stories apparently.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  [PAUSE]
R:  Well, I wonder if our ten minutes is [LAUGH] almost up?
L:  [LAUGH] They usually -- have you done this before or ...?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they usually -- they give you a warning --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- at nine minutes and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I think we discussed this issue pretty good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think so.
R:  [MN]
L:  How did you find out about the ...
R:  RMC.
L:  What's that?
R:  The Refunders.  Uh, ever heard of that?  Refunders Make Sense?
L:  No, I've never heard of that.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, a lot of them on -- it's a money saving sort of thing but --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  I really like it but it -- that's how I heard about it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.  So how did you hear about it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] One of my, um, friends works in, um, speech stuff --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so he passed it on to me.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, he doesn't work for the Fisher Co company or anything but he just had heard about it through like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- co workers I guess.
R:  That's very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I --
L:  I guess they just need a large quantity of speech, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As far as I know, I don't really understand all the intricacies of it myself but --
R:  Mhm.  Mm.  Well ...
L:  Do you ever watch the comic news, um --
R:  I haven't even heard of any comic news.
L:  [COUGH] I guess, um, there is something called The Daily Show with John Stewart which is a mock news program and he kind of --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- does -- it's somewhat satirical and so he'll talk about a news story but kind of joke around about it at the same time and --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- they kind of make fun of reporters a little bit, like, who take themselves very seriously and stuff, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess they say that a lot of, um, like, teenagers and young adults get their news from -- I guess there's some previous statistic where like, [MN] a huge number of people, like, that's their only news source, is this kind of mock [LIPSMACK], uh, news program, but --
R:  Oh, that sounds interesting.
L:  Yeah.  It's pretty funny but it's a -- one of the [COUGH] -- one of the people who's worked on that news program, he was just traveling around the country doing speeches and I went to one that he did and someone asked him about that statistic, you know, "Do you think that that's really true that most, you know, college age students or college age, um, people [SIGH] get their news from your program?"  Or, you know, "What do you think of that statistic?" and he said that he didn't really believe it and he thought that [SIGH] just living in the US you get so much information all the time, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even if you're not necessarily seeking it out, in terms of, you know, the papers and the magazines and the Web and TV, that -- that you -- you get a fair amount of information.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even when you're not necessarily seeking it out, so ...
R:  Yes, I believe that is true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  Even when [SIGH], you know, sometimes just goi- going in Walmart and you hear, you know, people talking --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- about the latest headline, so you can't really avoid it. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Exactly.  [PAUSE]
R:  Mhm.  [PAUSE]
L:  I guess recently the -- I don't know, I feel like the US, you hear a lot about news all over the country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because there's such a free flow of communication like, you know, the sad case with Lacey Peterson, the woman who was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- drowned and although it happened in California I feel like the whole country is kind of following the news story, which is I think a little bit different maybe, I don't know, maybe it's similar in other countries too but --
R:  Hm.
L:  Just seems like we have more access to information that way.
R:  It's [MN].  I can't -- I don't know why, I've drawn a blank, but can't remember that little girl's name that was kidnapped.
L:  Oh right.  Um --
R:  [MN] Uh, she was --
L:  Something Smart, I think, right?
R:  Oh yeah, Elizabeth Smart.
L:  Elizabeth Smart, uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh, they sure followed that for quite a long time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Of course, that's another way of saying that, you know
