L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Terri.
R:  Hello, my name is Pamela.
L:  Pamela?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, it's nice to meet you.
R:  You too.
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about hobbies.
R:  Okay, yes.
L:  Well, let's see, [LIPSMACK] what kinda hobbies do I have?  Um, I do a lot of crafts.  Well, I don't do very many crafts anymore, I used to do a lotta crafts.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mm, I have a crafts booth at one of -- like a craft mini mall.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I do stuff like that and I used to do a lot of the, um, [LIPSMACK] little shows, you know, um, outdoor craft festival type shows.
R:  It sound very in- interesting.
L:  Yeah.  It w- -- it's fun and I've -- I've been doing it for years but I've kinda gotten outta that.  We moved, bought a house a few months back and I really don't have room to do a whole lot of it anymore.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, I like to do woodwork.  Um, I've got my little power tools.  Few people tease my husband because, you know, Mother's Day he buys me a drill press.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Things like that, you know.
R:  Okay.
L:  So people tease him a lot.  But I enjoy doing that, um, other than that I play on my computer a lot.
R:  [inaudible] and the same [inaudible] my computer all the time.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I do the same thing on my computer.
L:  Do you?
R:  [MN] Yes, I do.  And lately I've been making music on my computer, like CDs.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, I have quite a few of them.  Me and my husband both makes 'em all.  And so that -- that's -- making the CDs.  Like to read books and do crossword puzzles.  [several inaudible words] for me and my son.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [inaudible] my [inaudible], he's eight years old.  Give him something to do with his free time.
L:  Right.
R:  Other than play [inaudible] all the time.  Do something destruct- -- constructive.
L:  You download it from one of the sites or ...?
R:  Yes, from one of the sites called Kei- --
L:  Which one do you use?
R:  Kaiser.
L:  Kazaa?
R:  Kazaa, yeah.
L:  Yeah, we've got that.  My son is fourteen.
R:  Okay.
L:  And we've downloaded Kazaa.  Now, there's two different ones, there's a Kazaa and a Kazaa Lite and the Kazaa Lite is a little bit easier to use.
R:  Really?
L:  That's what everybody says.  We looked at Kazaa and it was very, very confusing.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  At least we had a hard time with it and I've also heard from a lotta people that Kazaa puts a lot of spy ware on your computer, whereas Kazaa Lite does not.
R:  Kazaa Lite.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you know these -- you know the difference between the two?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] not exactly 'cause I don't really get into it that much.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's basically the same thing, it's just that it's a lot easier to use.
R:  Okay.
L:  Let me look here, I'm sitting in front of my computer at the moment, I can give you the Web address if you want it.
R:  I just get off my computer [MN] also.  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Well, actually it doesn't even show the Web address on here.  But if you just do a search, like on Google, for Kazaa Lite, L.I.T.E.
R:  Okay.
L:  You could probably find it there.
R:  Ah.
L:  'Cause I don't see where  -- when I click on it, it just opens up this page and it doesn't give you the address on it.  That's strange.
R:  Mm.
L:  Hm.  But anyhow, um, [LIPSMACK] other than that, let's see, what other hobbies do I have?  Um, I enter a lotta sweepstakes on my computer --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- which is kinda fun.  And, that's about it I guess.
R:  Have you [inaudible] win in the [inaudible] sweeps as yet?
L:  I have.  Um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Right -- I started -- well, I got my computer a little over two years ago --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and right after I got it I started doing these sweepstakes and I probably had it about maybe four or five months and I won a trip for four people to Mexico, to, um, Cabo San Lucas.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, that was kind of exciting.  It was the trip and of course it was like five -- five or six nights hotel and seven days, and they gave you car rental and they gave you a thousand dollars cash and the whole -- you know, it was really nice.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um, right after -- we had made our plans to go in October and then we had the nine eleven ta- attacks.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I just really did not wanna go flying outta the country.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, especially since we were taking one of my son's friends with him.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, it's like, "I don't wanna take somebody else's kid outta the country".  Even Bush was saying, you know, "Fly, but try to stay in the United States", he advised not going outta the country.  So I talked to 'em, it -- I had won it through Pepsi and I talked to them about it and it took months to get everything, all the red tap worked through, but they finally agreed to give me the retail value of the trip, which was five thousand dollars.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  So they cut me a cheque for five thousand dollars, which was really nice. [LAUGH]
R:  I know it would.
L:  As a matter of fact, that's what enabled us to buy this house, was we used that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- five thousand dollars as a down payment.
R:  Oh.
L:  But other than that I've won a lotta small things.  I win T. shirts and CDs and DVDs and, oh gosh, what else?  I've won food, you know, coupons.  Like, I won a year's supply of M&Ms.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And, a whole ca- -- I won a case of bubblegum and ...  I won a printer, or a scanner rather, for my computer.  That was kind of a neat prize.
R:  Actually, that you [inaudible] my [several inaudible words].  You just [several inaudible words] having to look at [inaudible] sweepstakes or anything.
L:  No.
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  You know, years and years ago I entered, through the mail, but gosh it got to the point where stamps were getting so expensive.  We stayed broke all the time, we live paycheck to paycheck.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, I just kinda quit entering 'em, you know, it just -- it took up too much time writing all that information out, and like I said, the stamps were just getting outrageous, so I quit doing all that and then once I got my computer I got started into it again.  But [MN] I haven't won very much big stuff, you know, the trip was the biggest thing I've ever won.  But, you know, I figure my day will come.
R:  Yeah, your day will come and it's coming small but it's been coming.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know, it's kinda fun.  My -- my son enjoys it, I've won him several, uh, PS two games for his Playstation and ... um, I guess that I win CDs and DVDs quite often.  So, you know, I figure [LIPSMACK] eventually ... someday maybe I'll hit the big one. [LAUGH]
R:  You gotta just keep trying.
L:  That's right.
R:  Keep trying.  Sound like you had a lotta good luck with yourself, playing on sweepstakes and things like that.
L:  Yeah, pretty much so.  Course, I put a lotta time into it too.
R:  Your turn is coming.
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm not a real big TV watcher.
R:  You're not?
L:  M- --
R:  I am.  I'm just about --
L:  Are ya?
R:  Yes, I do. [NOISE]
L:  Well, I -- you know, I watch some but no, there's only like, maybe two shows a week that I really enjoy watching and I watch them on Tuesday and -- Monday and Tuesday evenings.  And other than that for the most part I sit in here and play on my computer most of the time.
R:  Don't you get bored with that sometimes?
L:  Sometimes I do, yeah.  And there are some nights that I just -- I just don't feel like sitting here and looking at that screen, or else I get really, really sleepy.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  From sitting in here looking at it.  So then I'll get up and I'll go do something else.  I like to garden, that's another one of my little hobbies.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm trying to get flowerbeds.  This yard of this house that we bought pretty much is just a blank slate.
R:  Okay.
L:  It doesn't have any flowerbeds or anything in it, and at my old house I had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- quite a few.  So that's what we've been working on for the past couple of months, this spring, while it's been so nice.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And the plant grow really well.  You in Washington DC area?
L:  No, I'm in Tyler, Texas.
R:  Oh, Texas, okay.
L:  Where are you?
R:  At Washington DC.
L:  Oh, you're in Washington DC.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Is it still colder?
R:  It's -- it goes up and down.
L:  Yeah.  Well, like today it's probably only in the seventies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Low seventies maybe.
R:  It's low seventies exactly.  Huh.
L:  Yeah.  But we've had a lotta days up in the nineties already.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's getting too warm, too quick.  Spring doesn't last very long in Texas, I don't think.  I'm originally from Wisconsin, so --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  You been doing a lot of traveling.
L:  Well, my mother -- back when I was in high school my mother ended up, um, moving to Texas and shortly after high school I came down here.  And then I met my husband here, so I'm still here.
R:  Yeah.  You're planning on staying there permanently?
L:  Oh, I imagine so.  I don't think I could ever get him to leave.
R:  Hm mm.
L:  We -- he's talked about it at times, um, have said that he wouldn't mind moving to Milwaukee.  I don't think he could handle the cold.
R:  So, I know I couldn't.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I do not like cold.  Me and cold do not get along.
L:  Well, the only thing about cold is you can always put more clothes on, but gosh, down here it's so hot and it's so humid and you can only take so many off.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  [inaudible] legal not [inaudible] butt, um, naked. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's against the law.
L:  That's right.  You can't really go to the grocery store that way!
R:  No.  You might, [several inaudible words] get he food for free! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So, we're supposed to be talking about hobbies, I guess we ought to get back on that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I know they said talk about hobbies and
