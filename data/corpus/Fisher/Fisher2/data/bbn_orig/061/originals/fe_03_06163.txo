L:  I'm Gail.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I guess we're supposed to talk about ... current --
L:  Current events.  And you're supposed to tell me your name.
R:  Oh I did.  I thought you heard me. [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  Oh, my name is Jennifer.
L:  Jennifer, hi.
R:  Yeah, b- I guess there was a pause there 'cause I said it a couple of times and said hi and no one answered.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, are we supposed to talk about current events?
L:  Yes.
R:  What they are or ... 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where we hear them?  Where we hear about --
L:  Uh, where we -- where we get them from.
R:  Okay.
L:  I get mine from MSN on my computer at work.
R:  I do, um, I watch news, Fox News.  Um, and on the computer it comes up like, the little bulletins on AOL.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and in the newspaper, which I have to say I don't, um --
L:  Oh, you read the new- -- you have time to read the newspaper?
R:  Um, actually, I have two small kids so I scan [LAUGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  But, yeah, when I get a chance, yeah.
L:  I don't have time to read the newspaper.  I just -- I set -- we have cable --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so it's either CNN or the news channels or I go back and forth.
R:  Yeah.  I [SIGH] -- my husband watches Fox News all the time so I see a lotta stuff here and there [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I catch it in and out of the room.
L:  Uh, I know, don't you hate it whenever, um, you -- you hear something and it's just half of it and it's going off.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then you try to catch what you missed somewhere --
R:  You have to wait --
L:  -- and you never -- you never can catch it up, you never can figure out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what happened.
R:  You have to wait for the whole loop to go back around --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if it's on the TV or ...  That's, um -- I heard something the other night about some journalist that was, um, plageri- -- not plager- -- like, made up a whole bunch of stories.
L:  Yeah!
R:  And I just heard the end of it and I asked my husband, I'm like, "Who -- who did that?  Where are they from?" and he's like, "I don't know, I wasn't watching" [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Who --" I just saw it -- this was a couple of days ago I heard it I think and I just found out today, I read somewhere where it was.  I was like, "Finally!" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, finally.
R:  It took me how many days to --
L:  There was, uh, there was, um, a real bad wreck in Irving, where I work, and, um, I searched everywhere to find out what had happened because I sat on the highway for nearly forty five minutes --
R:  Oh God.
L:  -- in one place.  And, um, when I passed it I saw where they had two people covered up with the yellow --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- plastic sheets, so that obviously meant that they were deceased.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I looked everywhere to find out what had happened.  It was not in the paper, it was not on the news, it was not on MSN.  I even looked in the Irving [LIPSMACK], uh, little bulletin, you know, their little city paper.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it wasn't in there.
R:  And that's --
L:  So --
R:  -- when it just sticks, like there -- when you have those things where for some reason you have to know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean --
R:  And you just can't.
L:  -- they kept me on the highway for forty five minutes, I wanted to know what happened.
R:  Yeah.  That -- like that newspaper guy or whatever it was, it was -- there was no reason why I had to know it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it wasn't gonna change my life. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it still -- I just had to know what it [LAUGH] was.  I was just like, "Oh, what's going on?" 
L:  Yeah.  I find that I, um, I work so much, you know, uh, in my office that, um, on my breaks I like all the, uh, [LIPSMACK] I like all the, uh, interesting informa- -- you know how people read fiction and stuff?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't read fiction.  When -- when, um, I pull up MSN I like all the factual stuff that they have out there like, um, all, um, all the stuff they're testing, I like, um, [LIPSMACK] the health news that pops up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause it pops me on MSN.
R:  Yeah.
L:  About health news that they've discovered because I don't like to take a lot of pills and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I watch -- I help my doctor watch what I'm taking. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm one of those freaks that doesn't like to take a lotta medicine, so --
R:  I -- I'm the same way.  That's -- I watch all that stuff too because I'm really -- like, even when I was pregnant I wouldn't take -- they say you can take Tylenol and, you know, I would have it where I could barely move my back hurt so bad and I was like, "No, I'm taking it". [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  "I'm fine, I can deal with it" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  "I'll just lay down.  I'll take the -- you know, I'll stretch, I'll --" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, 'cause, um, there was a -- there was a lotta girls in my office that were saying something about [NOISE] this new, um, they're taking something called Meridian.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they have, um, [LIPSMACK] they have thyroid problems.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I started searching on the news today and they had something about Meridia on the, um ... on the, um, MSN.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I was reading about that to see if it was, you know, safe, 'cause they're not the type to question what the -- what the doctor does, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're just, "Oh well, okay --"
R:  I don't understand that, I read --
L:  "-- if you think that's gonna work".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, "If you -- if you think that's gonna work then yeah, I'll take it, yeah, give it to me".
R:  Yeah.  See, I search everything.  I search for my family.  My family calls and, "My doctor said they might put me on this, what is that?" and I'm like, "Okay, I'll send the information".
L:  Oh, you do that too?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  Oh my God!
R:  I just sent my sister a packet today on some prescription that her doctor -- I printed off a whole bunch of stuff and sent it to her.  I'm like, "Don't take this". [LAUGH]
L:  I do the same thing.  They call me and wanna know, um, about, you know, different drugs or different medicines or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, like --
R:  Different health issues and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "I've got this, what do you think it is?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  That's exactly what they do to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I just go on MSN and look it up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm too -- I -- everybody's always going to Yahoo or someplace else and they'll say, "Well, why don't you go to Yahoo?" or, you know, "Why don't you look it up here or look it up there?"  But you know what?  When you go on Yahoo I don't see all of the, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't see all of the headlines and the stories that I do on MSN.  I mean, maybe if I went to the news I would see it but when you go to MSN it's right there.  There's so many topics to pick from that ... [LIPSMACK] I just go there first.
R:  Yeah, that's, um, I -- when I click on it comes on the AOL and it has the -- the top headline things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's whenever I go -- I always find at least one story I wanna read about and the big one has been, I keep trying to stay away from it, but like, the Lacy Peterson bat[?] -- I've been trying to like, go around that, but I always find one that I have to click on and, you know, "I don't really have time to read anything but I have to read this". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know what?  I, um, [LIPSMACK] I caught the tail end of something last night and I don't know what it was and it was about that, because I'm really interested in that Lacy Peterson thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not only because, my God, if he did that, can you imagine --
R:  I know.
L:  -- how sick that man is?  But, um, now they're saying -- now they're dredging up garbage about, um, some cult that's supposedly out there that, um ... I gue- -- I don't know whether they were saying that they target pregnant women --
R:  Oh God!
L:  -- or, um, [LIPSMACK] that these people just sacrifice people, but, um, as usual I caught the tail end of it.
R:  [LAUGH] You don't know the whole [LAUGH] --
L:  And, uh, I don't -- I don't know what was going on.  I couldn't find it on MSN this morning and it was [NOISE] ... [LIPSMACK] I think it was, uh, some segment on Good Morning America this morning or something like that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I catch things on those shows too and I'm always -- I always turn it on and they're halfway --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through and they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- The Today Show or whatever, any of those programs.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I always catch part of what -- and then they come right when I'm like, "Oh, I wanna know what that story was" they come in with a select a food segment or something [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm, "No, go back to the news!" [LAUGH] 
L:  And you're going, "No, no, no, no, no --."
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- I missed that [NOISE], back up".
R:  Rewind.  [SIGH] "Say that again, would ya?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be cool if we could -- if the TV automatically recorded and if we miss it we could play it back?
R:  Oh, that would be great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All those times when I walk out and -- out of the room and come back in, I'm like, "Oh I missed it".  Or they'll say, "Coming up next we're gonna talk about" and I'll go and I'm like, I'll have time to do this.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I come back and it's over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm like, "Oh man!"
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  We just acquired my, um, husband's daughter and, uh, I -- I never thought you could miss so much, you know?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I mean, I used to come in and I would sit down and I would watch the news and then if I wanted to make dinner I would and, you know, then I would watch something else --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because I'm not a [NOISE] -- I don't read fiction or any of that other garbage, if I read a book it's, um, a self help book or a fact --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something that's factual.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um ... [LIPSMACK] things have changed completely.
R:  Oh yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, when --
R:  You lose a lotta time. [LAUGH]
L:  That -- you know, that's just exactly what it is.  Uh, we'll come in and I'll wanna watch the news or something and I'll have to be cooking dinner and then while I'm cooking dinner the news is on and you're trying to look over the bar and watch the news and then you can't hear because everybody's calling your name and ...
R:  Yep! [LAUGH]
L:  -- you can't -- you can't get it and ... it's just one thing after another.
R:  Trying to do ten million things at a time.
L:  Yeah.  And you look up and it's like, you know, eight thirty, nine o'clock and you're going, "Oh, it's -- it's -- it's time for you to go take a bath".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "You should be already in the bed --"
R:  It's bedtime.
L:  "-- What are you doing?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  I have a three year old and a six month old.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Yeah.  They keep me very busy. [LAUGH]
L:  You're much busier than I am.
R:  [LAUGH]
