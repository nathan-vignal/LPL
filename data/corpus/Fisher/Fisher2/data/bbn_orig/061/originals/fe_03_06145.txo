L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  [NOISE]  Hi!
R:  Hi, I'm Jay Jay.
L:  [SIGH]  This is Barbara from [NOISE] Florida.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, I'm in North Carolina.
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  Good.
L:  [NOISE]  I forgot about the telephone call tonight, [NOISE] I almost fell asleep.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my!  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, my, well, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not sure I have anything real stimulating on that topic [LAUGH] so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you might fall asleep.
L:  Yeah, they called la- -- they called last week, [NOISE] twice, and I didn't a- answer because I couldn't understand what she said.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh!
L:  The one time and then the other one.  [NOISE]  Excuse me it was so [NOISE] [SIGH] far out I don't even know what it was --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- what -- the topic was.  I don't -- I -- I'd never heard of what she was talking about.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, my goodness!  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I didn't take either call.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  So, ...  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Really?  Really?
L:  So, okay -- um, [SIGH] you guys getting storms up there?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, we have had a lot of rain.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Fortunately it has not really been like the tornadoes or the [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the super bad flooding but it's just this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right before --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just a couple of hours ago, [NOISE] right here at the end of the day, the [SIGH] -- the skies finally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- turned blue.  A little bit of sun came out for the first time in days.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I was just ecstatic because, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, it's just been rain, rain --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rain, rain, rain.  So, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]  They say the same up in Pennsylvania too.  It's been raining all the time.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And down here in Florida we haven't been getting it, at least in my area.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really, now what part are you in?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, [LIPSMACK] Tampa, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [NOISE] Clearwater.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, yeah, yeah, I've been --
L:  [NOISE]  Are you familiar with that?
R:  I am.  I've been there several times.  My in laws --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- live, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Clearwater or Tampa or where?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, actually they -- they live a little bit further up north.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um [LIPSMACK] -- um, they live --
L:  [NOISE]  Near Port Ritchie or some place like that?  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, near, um, Orlando.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, -- [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [NOISE] that's the middle of the state.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  I'm right on the coast.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  [NOISE]  I'm only, like, ten minutes from the beach.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's so nice.  That's --
L:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, it -- it is nice.  I don't go there all the time.  [LAUGH]  I should.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's so easy to neglect what's in your back yard.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, ah, [SIGH] ...
L:  [NOISE]  So, where do you -- I -- I -- our newspaper down here is fantastic.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  In fact I had to stop getting it [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because it's so interesting, [SIGH] it takes up too much of my time.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, my goodness!  Well how --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yes it's --  [NOISE]
R:  -- flattering for them.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah, the St Pete Times, I mean I've never [SIGH] -- you know, I come from Pennsylvania and I knew years ago it used to be pretty good up there, the Pittsburgh press, but [SIGH] down here the news, you know, [NOISE] ah, I just really --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [NOISE] the paper is really something.  [NOISE]
R:  Wow!  That's awesome.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  I can't wait to retire and just get to [SIGH] [NOISE] leisurely enjoy the paper every day.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, um, yeah, I really, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [SIGH] I really enjoy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reading the paper also.  And, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, yeah I was just brought up doing it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, like, [NOISE] from second grade --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my mother would hand me breakfast and the newspaper --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, wow!  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I was just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- brought up that way.  [NOISE]  So, --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, we take it every day.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I enjoy it and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]  See, I -- I don't get it every day.  [NOISE]  I'd ra- -- I watch it mostly on, ah, [NOISE] [SIGH] TV because, like I said, it's j- just so interesting and it [MN] just --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] takes up so much, um, -- [MN] you know, and I save this article for this one and this article for that one [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, [SIGH] and it's terrible.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  So, ...  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, so you get most of your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you get most of your updates --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- from the television, um ...?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I mean, like I said, I -- I really only get the paper on Fridays, [NOISE] Saturday and Sunday.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  So, yeah, I do mainly watch, you know, [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] well I watch old TV programs anyways.  [NOISE]  I haven't worked ... since October.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, you haven't?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Don't you feel like the, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Television news is not as indepth as the newspaper --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, versions?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I don't know.  Usually, you know, I mean I usually end -- I'm usually reading the paper [NOISE] when it comes in the morning here.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And, um, -- so I'm, like, reading the paper as I'm [SIGH] watching the Today [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] Show.  And I usually alternate between all three [NOISE] [SIGH] morning programs like Good Morning America [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [NOISE] and CNN.  I wa- -- you know, [NOISE] [MN] -- so I mean I just, like, really watch [NOISE] a lot of TV.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  And I, like I said, I -- I get all the channels [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] so I keep updated on [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [NOISE] [MN] most of the stuff.  [NOISE]
R:  Do you have a favorite ... s- show or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a favorite [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  News?  [NOISE]
R:  -- news?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Well, I -- I like the Today Show but I mean, like I said, in the morning a lot.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  But then, like I said, I watch the -- Larry King Live.  [NOISE]  And you know [SIGH] [NOISE] -- you know, CNN.  [SIGH]  And especially -- I mean since the w- [NOISE] -- I guess really since the war I really watch it [SIGH] intensely.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  Oh, yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, yes.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  How did you like that coverage?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  Ah, the war coverage?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  Well, [NOISE] it was kind --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of interesting because when [SIGH] the war broke out, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of course, I mean I -- I knew --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in my heart I knew the war was going to start when it did because you know, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- with that deadline, you know?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  And my feeling was that [NOISE] Bush wanted to go to war no matter what, and --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That's true.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean that was just my feeling, you know.  [SIGH]  And so [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the deadline was the seventeenth of March.  I said, "Well, I know we'll be to war on the eighteenth" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think it was the nineteenth.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but my husband and I had driven, um, down to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- New Orleans [SIGH] to see, ah, my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- step daughter and, [NOISE] ah, [SIGH] so we were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- most of the time, [SIGH] you know, in the car totally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- listening to that blow by blow, [NOISE] minute --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by minute, on MBR [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.  And it was just [LIPSMACK] ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I -- you know, it was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was good coverage but it was just so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]  Too close for comfort?  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  Well, it was just [NOISE] so play by play, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- minute by minute, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like listening to a ball game or something that, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it got to be a bit much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after a while --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.  I mean [SIGH] um, [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and truthfully it was close for comfort --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because my stepson is in the Army --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and fortunately [NOISE] did not have to go.  But we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were, of course, concerned about that and we had [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we have another family friend who was a young --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- single mom in the Airforce, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she was actually told she was deploying shortly before the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- war started and ended up not having to go at all.  [SIGH]  Um, ...
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that was luck.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, [SIGH] yes, yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, we were, you know, very, very concerned, you know, about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the possibility of -- of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] -- [MN] of course, anybody being there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but when it's -- you know, a -- a close friend or family member, [NOISE] of course, it -- it looks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little bit different.  So, ah -- [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, ... [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Yes, luckily my grandson was [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] he joined but [NOISE] luckily they found a blood condition which, in a way, is in his favor because --
R:  Oh, yes it is.
L:  -- [NOISE] he, you know, didn't have to  -- he got [NOISE] ... out of the Marines.  [SIGH]  So, I said that was good.  And then we found out that the other two boys have it, too.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh!
L:  [NOISE]  'Cause my daughter she mat- -- married brothers.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  Oh, wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, yes, so it's in -- you know, in the gene.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  That, um, [NOISE] -- you know, I guess together [NOISE] [SIGH] they have it, you know.  [SIGH]  And so all three boys, ah, [SIGH] won't have to go to the military thank God.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.  In fact --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  They're not supposed to take on attack sports or anything though.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  It's not hemophilia is it?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  No, but the youngest one is playing which, ah, makes me sick [SIGH] you know.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  But he was already into it.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  So, um, [NOISE] yeah, and he's ten and I [NOISE] hate to see them, [NOISE] you know --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] get it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  So, and I re-watch everything too on TV -- that Jessica Lynch again yesterday.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  [NOISE]  Yes, I watched that again [LAUGH] yesterday.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  There's always -- [SIGH] it's just like you're -- I'm hooked on it you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Wow!  Th- that -- I mean that was an awfully --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good story.  [SIGH]  Um ...
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, and it was like all three girls -- you know, how all [SIGH] three ended up -- you know, one dead one [NOISE] -- you know, the other two rescued and, you know, it was just really [NOISE] [SIGH] -- I don't know [SIGH] I just [MN] -- I wondered how kids could always watch these videos over and over again.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And I think to myself how many times I've watched Jessica Lynch, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And I -- I watch that, ah, Court TV too.  [NOISE]  See before I never had time to watch TV and now that I haven't worked for so long --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] you know what I mean?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  Because I used to be getting up at, like, two [SIGH] -- two thirty in the morning to go to work [NOISE] [SIGH] -- you know, to get ready for work and stuff.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And now that I have all this extra time, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [MN] I guess that's why [NOISE] I'm hooked on [NOISE] ... watching so much of it on TV.  [NOISE]
R:  It's real easy to get hooked into it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have, ah -- I don't watch much television.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've never gotten hooked into it and --
L:  Well, you're married too, aren't you?  See I'm by myself.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, that's sort of like my family --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] ... in a way.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, sometimes it's nice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to kind of have that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- background noise [NOISE] so to speak to, [NOISE] ah --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I usually have --
R:  -- to ah, --
L:  -- it on.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, like I said, I -- I guess now that I'm older, [NOISE] I'm sixty now [NOISE] [SIGH] -- so then I just -- seems like I watch all the [NOISE] [SIGH] news programs.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  And I prefer that over everything -- you know, [NOISE] [SIGH] over stories [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- anymore.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  That's why I said I click from one [NOISE] [SIGH] station to another.  [NOISE]  [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And we get the news at all different times down here too --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- besides CNN, [NOISE]--
R:  Wow!
L:  -- [NOISE] [MN] you know?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, [SIGH] you know, different ones.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And I think our Channel Nine always has t- [NOISE] -- you know.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  Wow!  So, what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so you really got into the war coverage?  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, I really did.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, you probably --
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, you know, --
R:  -- got into did yo- -- no, were you working when nine one one happened?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yes, I remember I was at work ... whenever that happened and I remember when [SIGH] -- when I was told, you know, I didn't b- believe it, you --
