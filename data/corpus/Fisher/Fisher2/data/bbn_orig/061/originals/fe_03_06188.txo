L:  Hi. 
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Linda. [LAUGH] 
R:  My name's Helen. 
L:  Hi.
R:  Hey, there.
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  One time. 
L:  And this is my third time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, good, so you --
L:  Kinda fun. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you're on the end of getting your, um, stuff done. 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  Excellent.  Well --
L:  So, is -- I guess we're supposed to talk about how we get our news, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, most --
L:  And how we keep up with --
R:  -- I mostly get it from the internet at this point.
L:  Yeah, that's about my -- the way I do too. 
R:  Um --
L:  I, ah --
R:  I don't like to -- ah, six o'clock or five o'clock news, because there's so many commercials and it's so loaded with stupid -- stupid stuff. 
L:  Yeah, I'm working usually during those hours.
R:  What city do you live in?
L:  I live in Sun- -- in Sunnyvale.
R:  In California?
L:  In California.  Mhm.
R:  I was going to say, because I don't know how it is for other parts of the country, but I know the news in L.A., the local news, is just pretty much entertainment --
L:  Yeah, are you in L.A.?
R:  Flap Trap[?], yeah.
L:  Oh, [NOISE] almost --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- everybody I've talked to has been in California.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Re- really?  Well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they have their ad in L.A. Weekly. 
L:  Oh.  
R:  So I wonder if they don't get a lot of people from that maybe.
L:  Maybe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know how long it's gonna be going on?  I just --
R:  Yeah, through next December.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm, yeah, but I think e- each person can only do it three times.
L:  Mm. 
R:  Um --
L:  Well, they asked on -- on the, ah, internet when I signed up, you know, whether I would be interested in doing more than that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I [LAUGH] said, "Yes", but I don't know whether or not they're going to do it, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- whether they're going to continue doing it. 
R:  Well, I signed --
L:  I guess this [inaudible] --
R:  -- up on the phone and they -- they didn't ask that, I don't think. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  So, I don't know.  But it would be good.  I like it.  Ten dollars.  Hey.
L:  Hey, yeah, that's pretty good.   
R:  Well, the first time --
L:  Now I'm --
R:  -- was kinda disconcerting because it does cut you off, sort of. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we weren't really in the middle of anything, but I think, you know, you kind of normally have a natural wrap up of things and --
L:  Sure.  Yeah, well, it's only, like, ten minutes. [LAUGH] Th- they kind of [NOISE] -- I know last time, they just kind of, um, came on right in the middle of everything and said, "Say goodbye".  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Exactly. 
L:  And, ah, well anyway --
R:  Um, but --
L:  -- I usually watch the --
R:  -- it's kinda dull topic, because the last one that I had was, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- was there anything in your life -- it was, like, time travel and all this stuff and it was, like, is there anything you would change if you could travel --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- back in time.  
L:  Mm.
R:  That -- that really opens people up.  But as far as just getting the news, it's, like, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, one thing I --
L:  There's not a lot you can say about it [MN] --
R:  Well, one --
L:  -- you know. 
R:  I'll say this, it's, like, during the, um, war time, the worst of the war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- time, one thing I liked about the internet, ah, was that I would go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into the Jordanians Times --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the inter- -- ah, on the internet and see how their viewpoint was about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the news because they were, um, they're pro Arab and -- and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I had seen it before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when things were a little more, like, building, there would be different viewpoints a- expressed on there that were interesting.  It'd be, like, their spin on what they were seeing and stuff happening.  So I always looked there to see if, like, there's something that isn't being really --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- told through the news that we get.  'Cause I really --
L:  I --
R:  -- look at a lot of the news that we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get as propaganda. 
L:  Yeah, and I usually just watch, you know, when you look at the, ah, internet, and get it from the different, ah, websites and all, ah, and --
R:  It's nice to be able to look at the news without too many ads. 
L:  Yeah, and then if there's something special going on, you know, like when they had the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the, ah, September eleven -- the terrorist act- -- when something like that, or ma- -- something major is going on, I usually will turn the TV on and sit in front of it, you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And watch --
R:  I don't actually --
L:  -- the whole --
R:  -- well, the difference too --
L:  And watch it if I'm home.
R:  -- is I don't -- I don't get cable or CNN or any of that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so all I get is the networks.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  Well, I have cable because I live in a mobile home park and they provide it.  
R:  Mhm.  That's nice.
L:  And -- yeah, so I can get, you know, like, the, um, the news stations --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that have nothing but news, and they're pretty good. 
R:  When they're talking about really --
L:  Sometime --
R:  -- current events, oh, the other thing is I would say, um, I read a magazine called -- I think it's called The Week --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was --
L:  Uh-huh. 
R:  -- sent to me for free.  And what it does is it goes through all the other news magazines and it -- actually again it doesn't have a lot of ads.  It's like Time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Maga- -- I used to get Time Magazine and I would just read it while I was working out and I figured, okay, that really did keep me up on current events, 'cause otherwise I pretty much wouldn't bother --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on, but I would get a lot from that, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's -- there's a lot of ads and things like that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that was okay, but then I stopped taking it for whatever -- I don't know why exactly and, ah, but then I got this free one and it didn't have any ads and it really summarizes -- i- it doesn't just have one editorial, it'll summarize, like, an editorial opinion from one source and then it'll go the opposite editorial opinion from a different source and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then it'll give you yet the opposite again, so you're really getting, like, really a lot of condensed information, um, of everything that happened that week on all different topics, in one --
L:  [NOISE] That sounds like a good --
R:  -- one magazine.
L:  -- good deal[?].
R:  Yeah, I liked it a lot.  I mean, it came free and it's not that expensive or anything --
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and it was just it kinda covered everything.  It had, you know, everything from science --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and medicine, technology, and it would have all the major political stuff going on and, um, but then it would have, like, a few little funny things, like, um, overheard or gossip --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- type stuff.  Not too much entertainment, but a little bit, like what was happening on Broadway --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or different things going on and it just seemed to summarize everything the news magazines did.  So I -- I guess [COUGH] that would be a source --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  I have a clock radio, you know, and I usually have it come on --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- in the morning when I wake up and so whatever news is on at that time, I will hear --
R:  Do you have it tun- -- what do you have it tuned to?
L:  Ah, golly, I don't even know what station --
R:  N.P.R. --
L:  -- it is.
R:  -- is it N.P.R., National Public Radio?
L:  No, it's just one of the local stations --
R:  Mm --
L:  -- here.
R:  -- okay.
L:  You know, they mostly have just what's happening with the commute, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they do --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] they --
R:  And the weather.
L:  -- do give you headlines, you know, like, for -- and so if anything major is happening, you know, they'll touch on it a little bit and then I -- if it's something that I wanna watch on the TV, I'll go do that, but usually I'll just check, like, on Yahoo or something, and -- and read it and if it's something I wanna follow up they usually give a lot of different, um, sources that you can go to.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And links to other articles --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- on different topics, so that you can kind of --
R:  Yeah, if you're interested in something.  But one thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- don't think I get it from is really other people.  I mean, mostly, if anything, if I'm talking to other people, it's more we're catching each other up on what we might have scanned[?].
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But it's not really like somebody is providing information.  
L:  Well, like, for example, the, ah, September eleven -- the -- the terrorist activity -- the first I heard about it was from another person. 
R:  Well, me too.  I was asleep and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- somebody woke me up.
L:  'Cause I was at school and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- I was teaching -- working and -- and somebody came in and said, "Oh, have you heard?", you know [LAUGH] and I said, "No, I haven't he- [LAUGH] -- I haven't had the TV on or a radio or anything --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- ah, to hear anything", you know.  So then as soon as I'd gotten home, of course I turned the TV on and sat in front of it and didn't get anything else done, but, you know, just watched to see what was going on and, ah --
R:  Yeah, um, whoever that person is that calls is usually a close friend or somebody really, you know, making sure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're okay or something like that. I found that was really interesting during that period was, like, you really want to connect with people, even if they're long distance.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- it was kind of that way when we had that big earthquake here.  Ah, I don't know if -- of course you're down southern California, but when they had that big one up here, ah --
R:  Where -- where -- you're in Sunny Vale, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't think that was that far from -- i- it's, um -- you're -- you're -- you're still, like, in the mi- --
L:  Real close to, ah, San Francisco.
R:  Oh, are you?  Okay, I thought --
L:  Uh-huh, [inaudible]. 
R:  -- you were a little further south than that.  I didn't think it was that -- it was that close. 
L:  No, it's been --
R:  Okay, I remember that big earthquake, yeah, and then and San Francisco was totally browned out --
L:  Yes, that was --
R:  -- blacked out.
L:  -- very, very, ah, traumatic, ah, but boy, we sat in front of our TVs watching all the stuff that was going on up in San Francisco, and watching the rescue efforts and, ah [LAUGH] all of that, you know, we were just sort of like in a state of shock, but that's one time I did watch TV a lot. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [inaudible] --
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- the power went --
R:  -- events like that --
L:  -- back on --
R:  -- we got great coverage as far as that goes.  I didn't actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- watch any of the war, like, apparently there was enough of the coverage that you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- could actually see us, like, actually, [COUGH] you know, actually having fights --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- apparently, I -- I did actually heard about that, I didn't really see it. 
L:  I saw some of it, but I didn't, you know, I -- I don't -- don't really wanna watch all that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, no, no, it's not a -- a --
L:  It's not --
R:  -- [COUGH] 
L:  -- it's kinda disturbing to watch --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but especially --
R:  Well, and I'm also --
L:  -- when you think, you know, you might see somebody you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm really aware -- I -- I just, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, there's just been so much information about how the mo- most media giants have merged, ah, to the point where it's just controlled by a few people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- and I really did feel that the [COUGH] -- the rescue of the nineteen year old, Jessica I think her name was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Jessica, I really thought that was really heavily propaganda as, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [COUGH] it's funny.  There was nothing going on and I think it was really positive for us at the moment and suddenly, okay, we got somebody back and it's a woman and, boy, did they talk about that for days --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and days and days and days and days and days and days, and even then I had the instinct somebody told them where she was.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- knew, I knew, and I -- I even felt like, well, maybe the Iraqis really just didn't wanna have the bad publicity of [COUGH] killing an American woman who wasn't even a combatant, really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So they just basically put her in -- had her in the hospital and they just said, "Look, just --", you know, they --
L:  Come and get her.
R:  -- leaked it out. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I thought they might have leaked it out. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And then it comes -- low and behold, after it was, like -- first it was, like, um -- and actually my boyfriend's really a linear kind of [COUGH] thinker and he's a very, um, pro military and -- and -- and I am to some degree, ah, I agree with a lot of his opinions and stuff, but, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even he was sort of like, yeah, I heard something about how they were talking about this -- how daring it was and how crazy and amazing and what an exploit and he goes, "It just didn't sound right".  It sounded a little too --
