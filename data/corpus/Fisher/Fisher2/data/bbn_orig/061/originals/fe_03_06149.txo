L:  [NOISE]  Hi, I'm Stacey.  How are you?
R:  Hi, I'm Juliana.  [SIGH]  Where are you --
L:  [MN]  Hi!  [NOISE]
R:  -- where are you from?
L:  [MN]  Um, I'm o- originally from Oklahoma, currently living in Maryland.
R:  Really?  I ... l- lived in Oklahoma too.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow!  Currently or ...?
R:  I lived in Bartlesville.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  I lived in Edmond.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, that's cool.  [SIGH]  That's interesting.  I live in ... Pennsylvania [NOISE] ... currently, so ...  [SIGH]
L:  Okay, so you're not far from the study?
R:  No!  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how --
R:  Um, shall we start?  [MN]
L:  Sure, so how do you get most of your news?
R:  [MN]  Um, I usually get most of my news from off the Internet [SIGH] or from people.  I don't really watch the news on TV very much.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, favorite sites?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I -- whenever I sign on line I -- a- ah, MSN [SIGH] always comes up and that's what I look at.  [SIGH]
L:  Very cool.  I --
R:  Where do you -- how do you get your news?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, most of my news also comes from the Internet.  Um, I read the Washington Post on line [MN] --
R:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I read Simone ... on line --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- which is the only place it's available.  [MN]
R:  Mm.
L:  And then I p- periodically dip into the New York Times [SIGH] or, ah, --
R:  [SIGH]  [MN]
L:  -- I occasionally get things mailed to me as well.  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- CNN does a b- bulletin, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sort of -- like breaking news shows up on my ... in mail [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- inbox.  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I try --
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- not to -- I -- I -- I do watch television news occasionally but it always just really annoys me.  I [SIGH] --
R:  Do you watch television or ...?
L:  [SIGH]  Ah ... to watch television news 'cause it tends --
R:  Yeah, me to I --
L:  -- it tends to be r- really sensationalized.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum --
L:  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  I don't -- I don't really like watching the news on [LAUGH] TV.  I [SIGH] -- whenever I w- watch TV I like to watch, um, [NOISE] -- um, I like to watch, like, sitcoms and stuff, not really the news.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, yeah, they are what they present --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- themselves to be.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I do occasionally watch the news --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- j- just to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sort of a- amazed by t- the, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] all the ways that they try to really make [NOISE] p- plain news so exciting; the background music [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and the dramatic walking toward the camera, [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and trying to make every little story really outrageous.  [SIGH]  Um, my degree's actually in, um, communication and journalism.  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- so at one point I actually thought I was going to be working for the media [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and -- and so w- when --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I watch television news, it's always just sort of like, [SIGH] "Oh, wow!  What ... ever happened to the ideas?"
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  You know, news is sort of a [SIGH] -- a noble thing, you know, Edward Murrow, Walter Cronkite.  Come on, [SIGH] you know, give me someone who's not screaming.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Well, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like all the people going over to Iraq, all the news people and stuff.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  They make a big deal like they're so --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] heroic for going over there and everything.  But [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't know, [LAUGH] that kind of bothers me that they're so heroic for going over there and [NOISE] -- [SIGH] I mean, I think it's great that they're broadcasting and that but --
L:  Uh-hum.  [MN]
R:  -- [SIGH] they're also just putting themselves in danger.  [NOISE] And --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't think all t- those people need to be over there ... just need a couple.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I have -- I -- I have very mixed feelings about that because on the one --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hand I do think it's very important that we get, [SIGH] um, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uncensored news.  I don't want to get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all my news from ... any government -- US government, Saudi government, whoever.  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and so I do think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's important to have journalists over there.  [SIGH]  And -- and it is kind of a brave thing.  Journalists get killed, you know?
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  Again, since I considered going into journalism --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- myself, [SIGH] um, you know when I'm thinking about [SIGH] would I want to go over there and risk getting killed so that people would get the news?  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  P- probably not.  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, it is --
R:  I think I would be.
L:  -- so it is ... i- it's important to me that they're there doing it.  [SIGH]  But I do agree that we p- probably don't need q- quite as many journalists over there as we end up with.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, and especially the embedded journalists because I feel like, [SIGH] um, first of all, h- how unbiased can you be when you're dependent on the military?  [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And, second of all, [SIGH] the military has better things to do than p- protecting a couple of reporters.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean I -- I can only assume that they get in the way.
R:  They're on a mission over there and [SIGH] ...
L:  [MN]  Right.  So, it seems to me that the reporters ought to go a- and ... be responsible for themselves.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, ah, both journalistic -- for journalistic, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- integrity and just to s- stay out of -- out of the way of the, ah, [SIGH] the u- units that are trying to do their job over there.
R:  Um.  [NOISE]  I agree.  I [NOISE] -- I don't know, I just [SIGH] -- w- whenever the war began -- or like ... the war on terrorism began and, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess Geraldo Rivera -- i- is that who went over [NOISE] there?  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, he's just -- he's a sad, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sad excuse for a journalist --
R:  But that just really --
L:  [SIGH] which is really sad because --
R:  -- I don't know [LAUGH] -- bothered me.  I -- I didn't understand why he [NOISE] would go over there [NOISE] and, [SIGH] I don't know, --
L:  [SIGH]  Well, you know, --
R:  -- I think that started me off on the whole --
L:  -- I think --
R:  -- not liking it.  So, ...
L:  Yeah, that -- about thirty years ago he was actually a very serious journalist.  [SIGH]  He was --
R:  Really?
L:  -- respected and he threw it all away.  He really [SIGH] -- he really went off course some where along the years.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And, ah, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- i- it -- it's kind of a sad thing because if [SIGH] you -- you can occasionally see clips of him [SIGH] from, um -- certainly in the seventies.  And he may have even been working in the sixties, although I wasn't watching the news at that point so I can't --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- say that for sure.  [SIGH]  Um, and he was actually doing important work and -- and really hard hitting news.  [SIGH]  And, ah --
R:  Yeah, now he's just doing [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- talk shows or whatever they're called.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and now he's, you know, bragging about carrying his own gun.  [MN]
R:  Right.  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Sort of, "Okay!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]  Yeah, he -- he --
R:  I don't know he's -- he's interesting.  [MN]  [SIGH]
L:  It is hard to believe he was ever a serious journalist --
R:  Right it is, --
L:  -- when you watch him now.  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially watching his show [NOISE] every so often [SIGH] and seeing him on that.  [SIGH]
L:  Does he still have --
R:  Um [NOISE] --
L:  -- his own talk show sort of thing?
R:  [NOISE]  Do what?  [NOISE]
L:  Does he still have his own talk show?
R:  [NOISE]  I'm not really sure.  [NOISE]  The only one that I o- occasionally see [SIGH] when I'm flicking through the channels is like ... [NOISE] Sally, or something like that, like, the females.  I don't really see the [NOISE] males.  [SIGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  I never ... enjoyed watching them.  [NOISE]  So, [SIGH] ...
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I'm pretty sure you lose IQ points for, like, every ten minutes that you watch.
R:  Yeah, especially Jerry Springer.
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Really!
L:  [MN]  It can't possibly be good for you.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well how many times d- do you look ... on the Internet for news?  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, [SIGH] wow!  [SIGH]  Well --
R:  Like every day or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, at least once a day.  At --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- least once a day.  [SIGH]  Um, because I -- I check it in the morning.  Um, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [MN] you know, first thing, get up see what's going on in the world.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, and then I -- I usually check in on it throughout the day.  Um, the job I have ... has [MN] up times and down times.  So, some -- sometimes you're really busy and sometimes you're w- waiting for something to process.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And so it's just kind of twiddle your thumbs time.  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- y- you ... pull up the Internet and hop over and see what's running on the, ah, AP News wire [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- find out if anything --
R:  Well that's --
L:  -- if there's any breaking news.
R:  -- like when I was in -- I just got -- um, some of my breaks in college but when I was in college and I'd be in the dorm, and I -- I was really bored [SIGH] I would look at it -- the news all the time on line.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But now that I'm at home and my computer is not, like, right b- beside my bed any more I just ... don't even really look at the computer very much.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I was actually ... on line --
R:  So, --
L:  -- when the phone rang.  [NOISE]
R:  Really?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  So, you're on pretty often?
L:  [SIGH]  Pretty frequently.  Yeah, like I said, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have a desk job and I'm connected all day.  [SIGH]  And so although I'm not looking at the Internet all day, [SIGH] um, [MN] I'm looking at it intermittently when I'm [SIGH] -- you know, I -- I have jobs that I submit to a mainframe computer [SIGH] and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- s- sometimes if there's a lot of traffic it can take, you know, ten, fifteen minutes [SIGH] for me to get my response back.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And so there's no point in me starting ... a whole different work project [SIGH] so I might as well ... pop out and see what's going on in the world.
R:  Yeah, see what -- see what else.  There's not really m- much else I feel like ... that's interesting on t- the Internet any more.  [SIGH]  I'm so used to it there's not really -- [LAUGH] like [SIGH]-- I don't know, [MN] I'll look at ... the news or s- see what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- new clothing's on [LAUGH] s- something else, but [SIGH] that's about it.  [SIGH]  [MN]  I'm not really interested in the [LAUGH] I- Internet any more.  I guess it's not as exciting any more to me.  [SIGH]
L:  All burned out?  [MN]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I'm burned out by the [LAUGH] I- Internet.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I don't know, [MN]  [NOISE] um, [NOISE] what else can we talk about?  [COUGH]  [NOISE]  Um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] well if you ever -- do you watch the news on TV what are y- -- what channels do you watch?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  Um, [MN] you know, you'd think I would know that wouldn't you?  [SIGH]  Um, I know that ... F- Fox News j- just gives me a stroke so I a- avoid that.
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, and I m- mostly catch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, Tom Brokaw or Peter Jennings.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  And I'm sure that they're r- respective networks would be really appalled [SIGH] that I can't tell you which one is on which [LAUGH] channel.
R:  So, do you watch like, ah, news channels, not just like a news --
L:  [SIGH]  No.
R:  -- show, like on NBC?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, i- it's either -- I think it's -- I think what I watch is CBS and ABC [NOISE] but I wouldn't swear to it.  [MN]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  No, Tom Brokaw may be on NBC.  Anyway, but yeah, it -- it's the main four.  We don't -- we don't do cable.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Ju- --
R:  I don't -- yeah, I -- if I ever watch it it's just usually e- eleven o'clock ... in the evening and [SIGH] CO[?] or like NBC or something like that.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]  So, do you do more local news or national news?
R:  Um, more local news 'cause that's -- I mean I do [NOISE] -- they usually show national news on TV.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Right on --
R:  Um --
L:  -- the local news.  [SIGH]  Usually that --
R:  -- on like NBC --
L:  -- that recap.
R:  -- on before the Eleven o'clock show and I'll just ... get a little glimpse of it --
L:  Now, do you watch --
R:  -- if I watch, ah, TV news show.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] do you watch any of the, ah, the news programs like Twenty Twenty or Sixty Minutes?  [SIGH]
R:  You know, I watch them [NOISE] more often than I watch like the Eleven o'clock Show [SIGH] [NOISE] 'cause I like those.  [NOISE]  I like how they have the stories.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I do, I like the way -- the approach [SIGH]  although I did watch, um, I think it was D- Dateline --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] a week or two ago and it was like a -- I don't know if it's always an hour or if it was just an hour --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that night.  [SIGH]  And it was actually --
