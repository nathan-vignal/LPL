L:  Oh.  That's interesting.
R:  What a- -- what about you?
L:  Uh, New York.
R:  Uh.  Never been there.  I have wanted to go though.  That's another hobby, I like to travel.
L:  Oh do you?
R:  But -- if that's considered a hobby.
L:  I like the country.  I like --
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- that's probably a hobby I would think.  Yeah, I love getting outta the city.
R:  Uh --
L:  I -- I don't know if I could live outta the city, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but -- because I'm just so used to the conveniences, but, you know, yeah, I d- -- I like to travel too.  Canada was one of my favorite spots.
R:  Oh, where did you go?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, Montreal.
R:  Okay.  I haven't been there.
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  I like bike riding.  I like to --
R:  In the city or in the country? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yeah well [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the country, it's a little difficult here.  I mean, once you -- you get to a park or something, you know, once you get to Central Park it's not bad but getting there, you know, it -- it's kinda like difficult.  There's just so many cars, buses, trucks.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I could imagine that.
L:  Um, so I like the -- you know, I think one of my favorite hobbies is just to blow outta here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That -- that -- where -- where's your favorite place than Canada?  Where else have you been?
L:  Um, n- well, no, I've never been out of the country.
R:  Uh.
L:  Uh, I mean other than Canada, but that's about it.  Jersey -- you know, the tri state area.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, [inaudible].
L:  You know.  I mean, Jersey, you know, you practically need a passport to get there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's just different, [LAUGH] you know. 
R:  I've only been to the east coast once, I went to Maryland.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I r- -- I really wanna go.  New York.  All those places.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, let's see, um, I think one thing, there are just a lotta hobbies available here.  [LIPSMACK] You know, there's a -- there's, um, I don't know, just everything that's pretty much accessible.  Um --
R:  True.
L:  So I think [MN], um, I'm really into spirituality.  I don't know if that would be considered a hobby.
R:  I think so.  I mean, do you read different books or ...?
L:  Read, yeah, big -- yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm an avid reader.  That might be a hobby.
R:  Um --
L:  I don't know, I guess I think of hobbies as like woodworking.  Do you know what I mean?  Like a hobby, I do- -- I -- you know, I just -- the -- the word, I just associate it with, um, you know, fishing [LAUGH], you know!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I d- -- I don't know.  I think everyone has kinda their own thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like [MN] I think a hobby's more like, I don't know, a pastime I suppose.  Something you just do.
L:  So eating would be up there.
R:  Th- that would definitely be up there.  That is a good hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's a hobby and I'm good at it! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That -- that -- that's a fun one!
L:  I can go on! [LAUGH]  Um --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Cleaning.  Believe it or not I like to clean, I hate to cook.  Um, so I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cooking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is definitely not a hobby.
R:  No.  Yeah, it takes too long. [NOISE] [NOISE]  Um --
L:  Smoking.  I don't know if that's an addiction or a hobby but [LAUGH] ...
R:  I think that's an addiction.
L:  That's an addiction, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, for some people it is a hobby, it's something they do socially or whatnot so --
L:  Yeah.  But for me it's --
R:  It's --
L:  -- not a hobby.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's definitely an addiction slash problem. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially with these new laws. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no kidding.
L:  Yeah.  You can't --
R:  Agh!  I don't know.
L:  You can't smoke in bars here.
R:  Yeah, I think they're making that -- I mean, I know, you can't -- anywhere in California you can't smoke within fifty feet of a building actually.
L:  God, sixty feet?
R:  Mhm.  So.  It's to try to keep the smoke even from entering the building.
L:  You can't do sixty feet here because at sixty feet you're into the next building.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] It's true! [LAUGH]  Sixty feet!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they basically have you going, you know, to your car or just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the middle of the street.  They really -- they're pretty out of it out here.  Um, being in California I suppose there's not much smoking anyways.
L:  Right, right.  I guess decorating would be another hobby of mine.  I really like to decorate.
R:  [MN] Uh, your house or just like books or ...?
L:  Yeah.  House, anything really.
R:  Oh.
L:  So that -- that might be a hobby.  Yeah, that definitely would be a hobby.
R:  [inaudible].  I attempt to scrap book my photographs.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  I guess that's a hobby of sort.  But I'm not very artistic so they never turn out too well. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but as long as you like doing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's -- it's -- I -- I don't think that, you know, it really matters how it comes out, it's just that the enjoyment of doing something.  I guess a hobby would be whatever's therapeutic or whatever, you know, takes your mind off of reality.
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  I like sleeping then, that's a [NOISE] -- a good hobby.  Huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  I take lots of little cap naps.  Cat naps.
L:  Do ya?
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you in school?
R:  I am.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh, I get -- I sleep in class, in between class, wherever it happens to fall. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you pursuing dancing professionally?
R:  No.  Just because, uh, I don't know, there's not too many opportunities to actually make it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- too big, so I just try to do it whenever I can.  Um --
L:  What are you taking up in school?
R:  Business.  So, I take econ and marketing and law and the whole eclectic collection of things.
L:  That's good.
R:  So ...
L:  Do you like to read?
R:  I do.  I do.  I'm actually out for the summer and I went shopping and bought a bunch of books.
L:  What kind of books --
R:  So --
L:  What books did you get?
R:  Um --

R:  I like reading lots of fiction books but I'm really into like dream dictionaries like love [inaudible] translation books.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, +books like things about the zodiac signs and --
L:  Oh, astrology.
R:  Yeah.  Really, you know, positive thinking books, how to be happy like --
L:  Yeah, I am.
R:  -- things to be happy about.  I really guess.  I like uplifting books.
L:  Yeah, I read a lot of those books too.
R:  Yeah, they're -- they're nice.  They make you feel a bit [inaudible] feel good books.
L:  What's a hobby that you do -- you don't do but you've thought about doing, or you'd like to do?
R:  Um, gosh.  Rock climbing probably.
L:  Mhm.  Adventurous.
R:  I did it -- I did it once but I just haven't had the time or the money lately.  I need a fee hobby. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no, I hear you on that one.  I just wanna go horseback riding.
R:  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  I think that would be kinda cool.
R:  I've never done that.
L:  Yeah, me either.  There's not many horses around here! [LAUGH]
R:  I c- [LAUGH] -- I can imagine.
L:  Um --
R:  Be a little [inaudible] to the cars.
L:  I guess going to the beach is a hobby.  I like that.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Um, depending us getting there though.
R:  How far away is it?
L:  Oh, well, I would have -- I'd have to take the train to Metro North and then, you know, it's a good hour on the train.
R:  Oh.
L:  So it's like two trains, you know, to get there, you know, and then you have to set up. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, um, but I like the water, I like being in the water.  Swimming I like.  I like to swim a lot.
