R:  Oh, actually, yeah, you know what?  I do too. [LAUGH]

L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, to watch television but I'm always, um, on the computer.  I'm always on the internet and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah --

L:  -- glance through the papers during the day.
R:  Yes.  I kn- -- you know, I used to get the newspaper but it was just piling up at my --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- apartment. [LAUGH] And I felt so guilty because I thought[?], "You know, I should be reading more", but [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, actually I only read the front page.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, the front -- the front page and Dear Abby. [LAUGH]

L:  Absolutely that's --
R:  Oh --

R:  You know what? 
L:  Absolutely the best --
R:  It -- it is.
L:  I mean, they -- they summarize everything.  They --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- have everything right there and --

L:  No.  Normally I don't -- I -- I don't want -- I -- I watch the very first --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I was just really intrigued getting the information, um, the news off the internet and everyone was voting and I thought, "Well, I just have to watch this one". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, did you like him? [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I -- you know, I kind of kept up to date through the internet but not --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- basically watching it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I hope it --
L:  I like --

R:  [inaudible]
L:  I don't know when the last time that you were down there --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  -- but it's really built up.
R:  Nineteen eighty.
L:  Oh, you wouldn't recognize it.
R:  I wouldn't?
L:  You -- you wouldn't recognize it, uh --
R:  Oh, 'cause they're so charming.
L:  The -- the old -- the old hotels are -- are basically down.  Everything is, uh, replaced with, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Victorian homes but modern Victorian homes.
R:  Oh.
L:  The whole town is nothing but Victorian.  It's absolutely --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- gorgeous.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  It's, um --
R:  I -- oh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  My goodness.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  I have such fond memories of going down there with my parents.
L:  Mhm.  It -- it just -- y- you would never recognize it [NOISE], um, but --
R:  In a good way though? [LAUGH]
L:  In a good way.  
R:  Okay.
L:  In a really, really good way.  Uh --
R:  'Cause sometimes --
L:  They -- they developed[?] the beach.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, it's a little bit longer.  They made a -- a boardwalk; a larger boardwalk --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- from one end to the other.
R:  Oh, how nice.  Okay.
L:  Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] Cape May Point, um, they put the --
R:  Cape May Point, uh-huh.
L:  Y- -- pardon me?
R:  No, I -- I know, yeah.
L:  Uh, Cape May Point they put the lighthouse.
R:  Ah.
L:  They -- they moved the lighthouse off to the beach.  They moved it back.  It's now a museum.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So everything -- you know, the concrete ship is really no longer.
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:   [LAUGH] Really.  It's just about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- gone. 
R:  Darn it. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, but it's -- it's just absolutely wonderful.  A lot of new restaurants.  A --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- lot of speciality shops down there.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's -- it's just really built up.  They have an open air mall where --
R:  Oh, they do?
L:  Yeah.  Washington --
R:  That's nice.
L:  -- Street, uh, it's just like, um, two blocks long and it just, um, no parking.  They just block the whole street off and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you just walk through it.
R:  My goodness.
L:  Yeah, they have the horses and carriages throughout the town.  They, um --
R:  Oh, that's so -- I love that.
L:  Yeah?  They have the house tours.
R:  Oh, they do?
L:  Mhm.  So, if you ever get back this way you'll have --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to stop down in Cape May.
R:  Yeah, I -- you know, I -- I -- I go back to visit my parents, uh, for three weeks in August and then I usually don't get back -- +maybe one other time during the year so [MN] we try to pack so many things into it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that we never make it back. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We haven't made it back but I think this summer we're gonna do that. 
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  And go down and check it out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I always remember there was this [SIGH] -- I don't know if it was a bar or restaurant called the Ugly Mug.
L:  It's still there.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, the Ugly Mug with the mugs.  You know why they turn --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the mugs?  Uh, some of the mugs are -- the handles are facing in and some are facing out --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  And do you know what that is?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, that is for the sailors that have passed away that you --
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  Yeah, uh, they have so many patrons that when somebody passes away --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- everybody has a mug, I guess --
R:  Ah.
L:  And when they pass away -- the sailors pass away they turn the mug and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- that's why they call it the Ugly Mug.
R:  Oh, that's -- I --
L:  It's still there.
R:  It's still there.  I always really[?] won- --
L:  And I believe it still has the original owners.
R:  You are kidding me?
L:  No, I'm not. [LAUGH]
R:  My gosh.  Well, see some things never change. [LAUGH]
L:  Nah, [LAUGH] absolutely not and, um --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- there's a lot of other restaurants down. I mean, there's several different restaurants.  The, um, um, let me see which -- which ones would be down there for a long -- Lobster House.
R:  Lobster House; and what --
L:  Yeah, they -- that's really built up.
R:  That is, huh?
L:  The Lobster House.  You n- no longer, uh, since nine eleven, able to bring your boat up to the dock.
R:  Oh.
L:  They did stop that.
R:  Oh, I see.  Okay.
L:  Okay, so --
R:  That's understandable.
L:  Right.  And we have the Coastguard Station down there.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is a training station through -- through all of the United States.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, it's a training station.
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.  Um, it's basically -- that's where you go to train wherever you are throughout the United States you go to --
R:  Oh, you go Cape May?
L:  You go to Cape May.  Mhm.
R:  Gee.
L:  So, we're pretty well protected on the coast with the --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- Coastguard. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you spend the whole summer there, or just ?
L:  Uh, just the weekends.
R:  Just the weekends.
L:  Just the weekends.
R:  Nice.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's really great.
R:  Lucky you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, how is the weather out there?  That's a current event. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, the weather has been in the sixties and --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- cloudy.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, we've had a lot of rain here also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  An awful lot of rain, um --
R:  Have you?  Yeah.
L:  And -- but today was -- it's absolutely beautiful.
R:  Is it?
L:  It seems the rain comes on the weekends.
R:  Y- y- [LAUGH] and the --
L:  [LAUGH] We've had like forty days in the last fifty days of nothing but rain but it usually is -- usually --
R:  Nah.
L:  Usually on the weekends and on Mondays and Tuesdays when you have to go back to work are --
R:  Yeah, it's beautiful, right?
L:  -- absolutely beautiful.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, like, "No, I don't wanna drag myself to work". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Same here.
R:  [inaudible] Yeah, we -- we've had a lot of rain but we're now sort of getting out.  We have it -- what is called, um, May Grey where we get a lot of coastal fog.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then we go into June gloom where we still have more fog. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But that's -- and that's usually every year and, uh   So, we try to have to -- it's hard to get up in the mornings in all of that fog but, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's tough to deal with it and then it burns off by about noon.  So 
L:  Oh, that's not too bad.
R:  No, it's not too bad.
L:  I'd rather have the fog than I think than the rain.
R:  Yeah.  No, it's not rain.  It's just --
L:  It's j- --
R:  It's cool.  It's very --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- cool and then it'll burn off by about eleven and it still stays cool.  'Cause I'm right by the o- -- I'm right on the ocean.
L:  [SIGH] Oh --
R:  I'm not in- -- I'm not inland San Diego, I'm right on the ocean.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  So, it's -- it's -- it's cool.  It's not -- people think it's always eighty degrees here and sunny.
L:  I would think that.  I would think -- 
R:  Nah.
L:  I've only been in California to fly in and stay for a few hours then --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And then fly back out again.
R:  Yeah.  No, no.  It's -- it's -- it's -- it's fairly cool.  It's cool in the summers.  It's not -- it's not, uh, it rarely gets past about seventy five out here at the coast.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Even in the summer. [LAUGH]
L:  Even in the summer. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It -- you'll -- I mean, if it -- if it hits eighty you're like, "Whoa".
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  Amazing.  Mhm.
L:  Oh, my gosh 'cause we -- we here in New Jersey get up to maybe a hundred.
R:  I -- oh, I know.  I mean, I --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I remember --
L:  You remember this?
R:  I remember that and high humidity.  So 
L:  A- absolutely.  And mosquitos.
R:  Oh, yeah.  No mosquitos here at all.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, n- -- I --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Yes.  No, no flies, no mosquitos.
L:  No flies either?  Whoa.
R:  No, no.  Not that I -- not really, no.  No, we're kinda lucky that way. [LAUGH]
L:  I'll bet.  Well, we don't have hurricanes here.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we don't have hurricanes here but we have 'em down the shore.
R:  Down the shore, yeah.  
L:  Yeah, there's --
R:  Oh, I was down -- down -- I remember being down in Cape May in seventy -- gosh, maybe seventy five and there was a huge hurricane.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Was it in seventy five or seventy six?
L:  It was ar- -- it was around that area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, around that time.  I remember the ones that were in the sixties.  One --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that really destroyed Cape May.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That was --
L:  But we're, um, [SIGH] there's a lot of hurricanes, you know, um, you know, during the summer time like around August and September 'cause I know the hurricanes now are down the southern states.
R:  Down the southern -- yeah.  Yeah, well they've had --
L:  Yeah, like in Miami.  I think Miami has a hurricane.
R:  They've had some bad weather down there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The south.  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's a major event, the hurricane that's down there.
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  And they have quite a, you know, quite a few this time of the year.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know and then it kind of levels off and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then they ha- -- my friend lives in Orlando and he said it's -- it's already in the -- it's already been in the high nineties and high humidity.
L:  Wow.
R:  So --
L:  I -- I know, yeah.  Um, I love Orlando.
R:  Yeah, I've never -- I've been -- well, actually I went lo- -- years ago, but 
L:  Oh, it's changed.  I go about every two years.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  I don't tr- -- I try not to go dur- during the hurricane --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hurricane seasons.  Which I know right now is the hurricane --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- season.  They're ha- -- there like there's four major storms --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- packing some winds --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But [LAUGH] I try to stay away.  But, um --
R:  I guess about, uh, best time it's in Florida is around October?  I would think.
L:  [SIGH] Right.  Around October, September, October --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- when everyone goes back to school.
R:  Yes.
L:  And if you go down in like in, um, December, um, there's hardly any-
