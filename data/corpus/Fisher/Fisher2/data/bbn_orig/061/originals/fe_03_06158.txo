L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That always happens.  This is Sally.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Hi, it's Karen.
L:  Hi, How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  [NOISE]  I'm in Wisconsin by the way.
R:  Oh, I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  So, how --
L:  [SIGH]  So, how do you get your news?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [SIGH] mostly by t- the radio [SIGH] and newspaper.  I have two small kids, so keeping the TV on during this time is, [SIGH] you know, kind of difficult with everything that's going on.
L:  Exactly, 'cause I have -- I have two small children myself so -- if B- Barney or something is -- you know, it's impossible to watch TV.
R:  Right.  Well, also you don't really want -- I don't really want the TV on --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] when you know, 'cause them seeing it [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's different to them hearing it.  So, ...
L:  One choice they didn't give us is the Internet [SIGH] and I read an awful lot of my news on the Internet.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  'Cause I actually get up in the morning before the kids and [SIGH] you know, it -- and check some of the news sites.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, no, that -- that is interesting ... that they didn't give that out.
L:  So, I'm surprised that they didn't ask that as one of 'em but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and I get some radio but, ah, you know, I ... d- drive mostly locally now, I don't travel any more.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  I -- I don't travel long --
L:  -- it's like --
R:  -- long, ah, you know, far but when I'm driving my son to school [SIGH] I --
L:  Oh, you listen to the radio then?
R:  -- I turn on the radio --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on the way home because it's really the only [SIGH] -- really the only time and then, just [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] at night, you know, late at night I t- -- I turn on the TV [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I never really get to watch much TV -- of -- of the news, ah, --
L:  I don't get to watch any TV at all.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I just subscribe to our local newspaper but I used to read that on line almost every day.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Really?
L:  But I thought, "Well --"
R:  I find it hard to read on line.  [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I find it hard to read on line [LAUGH] I -- I see the headlines [SIGH] and the -- you know, little blurbs of like what's going on --the main things.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]  But I find it very difficult to sit at t- the ... computer and read.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, but -- ah, that's true and that's why I'm getting the newspaper because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I have a little more time to actually sit and read it, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- while the kids are watching TV or something, but [SIGH] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- um, I at least scan the headlines on line and pick the ones that I want to read [SIGH] you know, --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- or that interest me but [SIGH] um, [PAUSE] I -- I'm still surprised it wasn't one of the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one of the --
R:  I also hear it a lot from people ... around me -- you know, if my husband comes home and he says, [SIGH] "Did you hear such and such?"  I almost feel so out of it [SIGH] ... sometimes.
L:  Right, 'cause your home.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, just because I'm -- r- running around doing so many things and I have the kids so [SIGH] it's l- like, you know, ... if I miss the news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] for -- for like an hour or so [LAUGH] then something happens [LAUGH] then [SIGH] I never --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, and then I feel so out of it sometimes.
L:  Right.  Yes, I don't work any more but, um, you're right my -- I'm somewhat limited in what I [SIGH] -- you know, w- what I even get from other people unless somebody calls me if it's some great ... big event, they'll --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  -- like the September Eleventh I was playing racketball [NOISE] that day --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and somebody came running round the corner and said, "Did you see what happened?" [SIGH] you know?
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, we stopped playing and went up and watched it for a minute not know that -- that was when the first plane hit, you know -- not knowing that [SIGH] there was a lot more stuff to come but ...
R:  Oh, well, I didn't have the TV on either 'cause I had, um, a small child and I was pregnant so my husband called me from the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bridge [SIGH] 'cause he had travelled out of the city at the time for ... work.  [SIGH]  And he said, "Turn on the TV".  And as soon as I saw it [SIGH] -- and then the -- I -- I was watching when the second one hit actually -- and [SIGH] had plans to go out that day but tried not to.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  I didn't l- leave my apartment for [SIGH] ... a long, long time.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Well, and to be honest with you this whole thing with ... Saddam and all that I [NOISE] -- I certainly couldn't sit down and write an article about it right now.  I mean I -- you know, I -- I kind of know what's going on but [SIGH] I haven't -- you know, I'm not one of those -- like, some people are glued to the TV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and glued to the radio every single day when that whole thing was going on.  [SIGH]
R:  At the beginning I was.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  At the beginning I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in March when it first started.  [NOISE]  When the war -- when we first s- started bombing Iraq.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  But, um, [LIPSMACK] after that it was like I would get ... s- some information here, some information there and n- now, you know, there are bombings going on and it's [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I hear of them, you know, just very briefly.
L:  Right.  I know my husband would come home and we'd put the kids in bed and he'd probably sit up and watch it till midnight every single night.
R:  That's like my husband.  So, --
L:  And --
R:  -- that's where I get my information [LAUGH] from.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, and then he'd tell me what would happen in the morning, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- like, I mean, I'm not a night person at all.  [SIGH]
R:  Me either.
L:  I guess that I get up in the morning and -- before the rest of the world and [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and try to get what information I can then.  But ...
R:  Right.  And a lot of times, you know, [SIGH] that's old news.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know, although it's -- it's --you know, it's really not that current because things could have happened [SIGH] you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] things happen after that and then you miss the whole day.
L:  [MN]  Do you discuss a lot of, like, current topics with your friends?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Like news wor- -- newsworthy ones?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, some, [SIGH] -- some.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, when we get a ch- -- um, I mean it depends what friends they are.  I mean a lot of times I'm round [SIGH] all of my kids' ... parents.
L:  Right.  Just talking about kid things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's almost like another world.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But then, you know, [SIGH] I -- I -- I talk about a lot with my husband, you know, like when -- when we discuss what's going on and [SIGH] um, every once in a while it comes up [SIGH] but I'm not, you know, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah, exactly, I don't either.  And unfortunately we discuss more of the [SIGH] -- the horrid events like the Laci Petersen case and --
R:  Yeah!  [SIGH]
L:  -- which I think probably, for us with small children, hits us a lot harder.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um, you know, I picked up the local paper and there was something -- l- last night about this ... m- man who [SIGH] was just arrested who lives very close to me --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- because his -- he took his girlfriend's nine year old and she wouldn't flush the toilet so he went to the bathroom in there and stuck her head in the toilet.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!
L:  And then duck taped her and -- you know, I mean just terrible things.
R:  Oh, gosh!  Yeah, --
L:  And you know, he's --
R:  -- [SIGH] a lot of us -- I was very big into the Laci Petersen case also.  [SIGH]  And, um, I mean it -- it seems like that 'cause those are all over like [MN] -- like finally at the end of the day when I, like, sit on the couch and I turn -- you know, stupid stuff [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, like Entertainment Tonight or like, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  I read People Magazine.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too!  So, it's just not current events --
L:  Yeah, which is -- which you feel kind of guilty because -- you know, there's been -- you know, there's the war on one channel and the L- Laci Petersen case on another and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would say I -- but I think -- again, I think that's probably because of the [SIGH] -- what we're doing in our lives.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, I mean it's [SIGH] --
R:  Exactly, although the other stuff i- impacts it quite -- ah, quite a lot but [SIGH] it doesn't, you know, hit us --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as much at home as --
L:  As the things with the children and [SIGH] -- or the ... that c- chocolate they just found with all the Mexicans.  [SIGH]
R:  The what?
L:  The chocolate they found in Texas with all the Mexicans?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I mean, j- just unbelievably horrid things, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But since I lived in New Y- -- you know, s- settled in New York it's [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] a lot of times -- like, right after September Eleventh, that [SIGH] everybody would talk about everything and everybody -- you know, everybody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- would [SIGH] you know, discuss lots of things and then all of a sudden it -- [SIGH] you know, it just grew -- j- just the same way we always were.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]  You know, not --
L:  And for you and I'm sure you discussed it a lot more because you were there.
R:  Right.
L:  To be honest with you in Wisconsin [SIGH] --
R:  -- well there were a lot of people that -- right, there were a lot of people here that I know that --
L:  That you probably knew or ...
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  Right.
L:  But for us as close as I got is --
R:  Because somehow someone's connected to somebody.  [SIGH]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I said, somehow someone's connected to somebody so it's --
L:  Right and as much as I didn't want a connection, you know, a friend from high school is married to somebody who was in one of the towers.
R:  Right.
L:  But he ... was okay --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know what I mean?  But [SIGH] you know, that was as close as it got --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, again you felt kind of s- strange because we [SIGH] -- we're not that far away but I felt very, very removed from that.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, I mean unless it happens -- like, you know, in Iraq you know, we're not there.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Although we're -- you know, t- the war was on [SIGH] we were not there and it's not our [NOISE] children who --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, --
L:  My kids are -- I'm sure if I had -- you know, I mean I have friends who have children -- I mean [SIGH] it's obviously a lot different to them 'cause they have k- kids to worry about getting drafted and, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm just trying to get out of diapers at my house.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  Diaper free in two thousand and three, that's my goal.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's so funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- you're -- you have two?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, they're -- actually we are diaper free now my son will be three in June.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  [SIGH]  And my daughter turned four [SIGH] ... last March so --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- they're fifteen months apart.  [SIGH]
R:  They're what?
L:  Fifteen months apart.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah, what do you have?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I have a -- a- almost three and a half and a [SIGH] almost two.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, ...
L:  One of each?
R:  Yeah -- no, [MN] two boys.
L:  Oh, whoa, boys.  Lucky you.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would only have one child if I only had one -- if my -- my son --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would have been first.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, my goodness, he's so much more work than my [LAUGH] daughter is.
R:  Oh, I know --
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] tell me about it.  [SIGH]  But --
L:  [MN]  Well, I guess I'm current -- you know, um, you know, back to the news I just -- I don't know -- I [SIGH] -- I probably [SIGH] am certainly not as well informed as I was when I worked every day and [SIGH] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- [SIGH] had my friends coming there and talking about it -- and we -- someone brought in the paper so you'd pick up the paper in your lunch hour and read it --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and [SIGH] that's w- why I just subscribe to it because I -- my -- gee, I am pretty out of it here.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  The only -- [SIGH] you know, I get Better Homes and Gardens and People [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  That's not going to tell me much.  [LAUGH]
R:  And Parent Magazine and --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Nick Junior.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Exactly.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's hard.  It's really hard and I fe- -- I feel like [SIGH] really, really out of it sometimes.  [SIGH]  You know, someone will mention something and I'm like, "Oh, my God!  So, I call my husband and I'm like --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH]  "Okay, [SIGH] brief me!"
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mean I'm surprised sometimes too about things that [SIGH] -- that -- I'm surprised I know that others don't.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like those that are out there?
R:  Like, "W- where are you?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Like, I mean my husband is, um, a commodities broker, you know, so he's kind of glued to his [SIGH] -- his computer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the whole time the market's open and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sometimes I don't know where he is he must just be looking at just his stuff because [SIGH] like, "Don't you ... c- click over to the news or something --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- while you're sitting there?" you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  No, it's hard.  It's hard because sometimes when you don't have access to it at work [SIGH] [MN] or, you know, [MN] and I -- or you don't have ac- -- it's -- it's very difficult to keep up.  I mean [SIGH] although the stations say things over and over and over again.  [SIGH]  I find like if I listen to CBS News [SIGH] --
L:  It's the same thing -- oh, like, headline news?  [SIGH]  If you watch it for twenty minutes, they just start over again.
R:  Right, which is good because then you don't really miss anything.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, if you catch a little bit here and a little bit there --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- they're sort of -- [SIGH] but I like to fi- -- you know, when I -- when I find -- I like to find out things first.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Which hardly ever happens.  But it just so happened that I was watching the TV when [SIGH] we fir- -- you know, the first bombing happened so I actually knew like -- when -- when the actual war started.  So, that was -- you know, it was interesting and then just, like, trying to catch up.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  Um, you know, it's hard ... trying to catch up.
L:  I don't know how most -- oh, I think a lot of people just have more time to read probably I don't know.  [SIGH]  I mean I started a book in January and I'm still --
R:  Yeah.  I don't read either.
L:  -- only half way through the book and [SIGH] actually I started it on a plane back [SIGH] --you know, I was on a plane otherwise I'm sure I wouldn't even have gotten that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- far into it.  [SIGH]
R:  Right, [SIGH] --
L:  I don't know but --
R:  -- it's hard 'cause you're so exhausted if you -- if you want to even watch anything.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, by the time I get my kids to bed -- I get -- there's no way I'm going to stay up for the -- I don't what time of the news --
