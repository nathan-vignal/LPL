R: [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Hi, I'm Kia.
R: [LIPSMACK] I'm Doris.  And the topic was, how do get, um, our news?
L:  Oh yeah, the current events, right?
R: Yeah.  And I get mine from the radio primarily.
L:  Yeah.  I actually either the radio or TV like, New York One.
R: Oh, okay.  Okay, so you're in New York?
L:  Oh yeah, I'm in New York. [LAUGH]
R: Okay.  I'm in Atlanta, I get mine from the radio 'cause I don't hardly watch television.
L:  Oh okay, yeah, my TV is always on New York One, it just repeats the news over and over and over.
R: [LAUGH]
L:  So if I missed it earlier --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- I definitely catch it later. [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  And I also [LAUGH] -- I also like it 'cause it has the time and the weather in the corner too, so [LAUGH] --
R: Oh, okay.
L:  -- that definitely helps. [LAUGH]
R: Okay, okay.
L:  Um, yeah, it's sometime in the morning too like when I'm -- either I'm driving to work, a lotta times I have it on and, you know, they just put in like, the current events or the actual main topics, you know, they don't go into detail about everything but the --
R: Oh okay.
L:  -- main topics.
R: Okay.
L:  On a --
R: Well, [inaudible] -- with me getting it from the radio I only get it then basically about every half an hour.
L:  Okay.
R: So I just get the main, uh, the main features.
L:  Yeah, okay, I see.
R: So ...
L:  Yeah, we have a, um, a station up here, I don't --
R: [SIGH]
L:  -- know if it's down there but a station, it's actually a AM station, and we call it Ten Ten Winds.
R: Mhm.
L:  And their main motto is like, "Give us twenty two minutes and we'll give you the world" so [LAUGH] --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- they basically tell you --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- the main things and, you know, like exactly at a certain time --
R: [MN]
L:  -- like, um, within those twenty two minutes they'll do the weather and then they'll do, you know, the top story on maybe overseas or then they'll do something, you know, a current event like in New York or -- they give you everything, [LAUGH] I mean --
R: Oh, okay.
L:  -- you really am like twenty two minutes. [LAUGH]
R: Oh okay.  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  Um --
R: I don't know, um ... uh, things -- the m- -- I -- you know, the main reason really why I listen is primarily to hear the weather.
L:  Yes, okay.
R: And, um ... [LIPSMACK], um --
L:  Do you have like a weather channel there?
R: Uh, yes we do, but --
L:  Okay.
R: I don't know, I -- I really prefer dealing with the radio because, um, [LIPSMACK] for television it's almost like I have to stop a few minutes and watch.
L:  Okay.  Whereas so you could be doing other things and --
R: Yeah.
L:  -- listening at the same time?
R: Yeah.  You know --
L:  [inaudible].
R: -- because in the mornings I'm getting ready --
L:  Okay.
R: -- to go.  So therefore I don't want to [LIPSMACK] -- and then see, uh, the radio is convenient 'cause I have it then in the bathroom and I take it wherever I'm going.
L:  Okay.
R: So ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I just[?] --
R: To me it's just -- oh, I'm sorry.
L:  No, go ahead, go ahead.
R: Uh, go ahead.  It's just -- to me it's just much more convenient, so ...
L:  [several inaudible words].  I do understand.  I have a friend who every day she buys like two newspapers.  I --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- lie to you not!  She buys the Daily News and she buys the New York Post.  I mean --
R: [SIGH]
L:  -- she like, has that [inaudible] papers, so she's also just like my current events 'cause if something is going on she will let me know!
R: [LAUGH]
L:  So I use her to [LAUGH] --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  I definitely use her.  I mean, you can ask her any question about anything that was in the paper that day and she will tell you.
R: Okay.
L:  So, I mean, she's also my, uh, my news for the current events. [LAUGH]
R: Oh, okay, okay.  I have a neighbor.  Well, I have several neighbors that get the newspaper every day but ... mm, I don't -- I don't ask 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [LAUGH]
R: They don't volunteer information?
L:  Um, you know, sometimes -- sometimes they'll do -- someti- --
R: It has to be something really exciting?
L:  Yeah, sometimes they will tell me, you know, um, "Did you know such and such?" or, "Would you like to read about such and such?"  Usually, um, [LIPSMACK] on Sundays we will read the newspaper together.
L:  Okay.
R: I forgot that, on Sundays we do usually read the newspaper.  Um, but, um ...
L:  That's funny 'cause on Sundays that's the day that I really like, don't even worry about the newspaper.  Only time I go into the newspaper it's for like, the [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R: Okay.
L:  I just want -- you know, like the coupons for the stores and that's really the only time I actually pay attention to the Sunday paper.
R: Okay.
L:  But I know I'm -- like, where I live at, when you go into the train station there's always the people outside selling the newspapers, so it's like, easy access, and when I'm on a train, I mean, somebody next to you has a newspaper or either you're either glancing over their s- um, their shoulder and you catch something, you know, that catches your eye, or maybe, you know, like if -- if it has something on the front page that catches my eye --
R: Mhm.
L:  -- then that's the only time I really buy it.
R: Mhm, mhm.  Well, I don't buy it either.  And --
L:  Okay.
R: And like you, um, usually what I do is, I try to find, uh, positive things in the paper on Sunday.
L:  Yes.
R: I will like, go through the arts section, so I can find out what's going on.
L:  Okay.
R: Uh, as far as, um --
L:  In your area.
R: -- as theater or --
L:  Okay.
R: -- um, [LIPSMACK] at the art shows.
L:  Okay.
R: Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, a particular pla- -- yeah, like, I said, particular play or something.
L:  Mm-kay.
R: Or, um, activities that are occurring for the coming -- for the upcoming week.
L:  Mm, okay.
R: And I'll make note of things such as that or, um -- but if I'm looking for like maybe, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, for a -- a positive story, uh, [MN] um, I usually don't, uh, that's usually the first section of the paper, I'll just maybe read headlines.
L:  Yeah.
R: And, um, [LIPSMACK] it's usually like back in the paper, uh, like the living section.  
L:  Oh, okay, the --
R: I usually can --
L:  -- entertaining stuff.
R: Yeah.  I usually can find --
L:  I understand.
R: -- something that's more positive.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R: In that --
L:  -- definitely depressing.
R: Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R: Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's a lot -- it's a lotta things in the news and newspapers and all that, that just aren't, you know, positive thoughts. [LAUGH]
R: Right.  Right.
L:  It's -- it's -- it's -- and they -- they repeat it over and over.  I mean, you know there's crime, you know there's, you know, all these other things going around, for them to have to tell you over and over again.  And today there was a shooting here and, oh, the cops was here and there --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- was a fire here and it's like, "Okay, well, um --"
R: [LAUGH]
L:  "-- how about the good stuff?"  "Oh yeah, and, uh, the Governor wants to do this and he wants to cut that" and it was just like, oh gosh, it's really depressing.
R: [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R: I know.  So, uh, I try to hunt for something that's, uh, rather positive and, uh, you know, maybe they'll have something that sorta family oriented or, um, something in the living section.  And then too, I may read something on fashion, maybe a particular fashion show that's coming up.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I like fashion too.
R: Yeah, so, um --
L:  Definitely.
R: [LIPSMACK] So --
L:  But --
R: [MN] 'Cause sometimes I can find one that's coming up and it's free! [LAUGH]  So --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  I [several inaudible words] I don't blame you!  I do not blame you.
R: [LAUGH] So --
L:  And you said you're in Atlanta?
R: Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R: Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R: And, uh, 'cause I hop on the train too, uh, especially since my car was in an accident.
L:  Oh, okay.
R: [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  At least you have it out there!  You know --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- if, like, you was in Florida or somewhere, now you'd be outta luck! [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  At least you have it, uh --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, fast[?] trains [several inaudible words].
R: Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's getting like up here, I don't know about down there but up here we're going through a big thing now about how they're raising the fares as well as like, um, the trains and stuff --
R: Mhm.
L:  -- trains and buses.
R: Mhm.
L:  So they raised the fares and then now they're going into this thing about how the, um, transit authority, how they had a extra set of books and now they need to be audited again because the figures that they said there was so much of a deficit was incorrect.
R: [SIGH] Oh, okay.
L:  So now, um, we just won -- they -- they just took 'em to court and they just won as far as bringing the rates back down, but now the Transit is trying to appeal it.  So we went from a dollar fifty to two dollars, and we've been at two dollars for maybe about two weeks about now, and they got another week to appeal it and, uh, we can go back down to a dollar fifty. [LAUGH]
R: Well, see, that's what -- you know what?  It was our -- I remember reading, uh, about that in the paper, yours has been a do- -- yours was a dollar fifty, see, ours is a dollar seventy five.
L:  Oh.
R: Our -- our fare was much higher than anyone else's.
L:  Wow!
R: And see, people here were really, really complaining.  I mean, because you have a much better s- uh, service, and we have --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- done auditing too, there's been -- there was a big write up in the paper in regards to our, uh, Transit also being audited and like, the ch- um, [LIPSMACK] the Chief Executive, uh, [LIPSMACK] all this, um, um, expensive budget --
L:  Mm.
R: -- that he's using, you know, hotel rooms --
L:  Okay.
R: -- and meals.
L:  So they spending more m- -- oh, unnecessary spending.
R: But -- yes.  But the thing is, our -- c- 'cause ours has been a dollar seventy five, I know for like, two years.
L:  Mm.
R: So see, the thing is, here the, um, uh, which they call it Armada, that's our transit system.
L:  Okay.
R: They say that
