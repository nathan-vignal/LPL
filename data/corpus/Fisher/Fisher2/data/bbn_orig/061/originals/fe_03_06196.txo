L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi.  [MN]
R:  Can you hear me okay?
L:  Yeah, I can hear you fine actually.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah, I can hear you.  My name's Chris.
L:  My name is Lisa.
R:  Oh, hi, Lisa.
L:  How you doing?
R:  So, do you have any hobbies, Lisa?
L:  [LAUGH] I have a million hobbies!
R:  Really?
L:  [inaudible] -- yeah.  I like to -- I take pictures, I do a lot of photography, um, I'm an artist so I paint and I do collages.  Um, I collect a lotta things.  I guess those are hobbies.  [MN] --
R:  I guess so! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What are some --
R:  Wow, you sound talented. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I just -- well, I think that if a person is a artist they can do a lot of different things, they don't have to limit themselves to one thing because artists they just see things differently.  So, however you see them, you can make that come out in whatever you do.
R:  I guess so! [LAUGH]
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  I guess so.
L:  What are -- what are some of your hobbies?
R:  Oh gosh, you know, my hobbies aren't really as exciting as yours! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I like to travel and I, um, I raise dogs.
L:  What kind of dogs?
R:  Shiatsus.  Shiatsus.
L:  Sh- -- oh, really?
R:  Little fur balls, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're cute.
R:  Yeah, and, um, let's see, what else are my hobbies?  You know, I guess for many things I guess I don't stop and think about whether they're hobbies or not but --
L:  [MN] Yeah, exactly, that's what I was trying to say too.
R:  I mean, you know, I like to read, I like to listen to music.  I'm -- I am a crazy person, I'm an avid Nascar fan! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  But, you know, I live in the south and everybody down here kinda is, so --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  What can I say? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I read a --
R:  I -- I --
L:  I read a lot too.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's, um, interesting that, you know, s- what people consider their hobbies I guess, 'cause ... uh, a lot of things I do I guess if someone asked me if that was my hobby I wouldn't say that was my hobby.
L:  Yeah, I guess -- I guess a hobby is something that you do that doesn't necessarily give you a monetary reward.
R:  Oh.
L:  A reward that's other than monetary.  And if you do get money from it, would you still do it if you didn't make money from it?
R:  Right.  That makes sense, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  That makes a lotta sense.
L:  So, I mean, I -- a lotta m- -- I don't make money off of, um, my paintings yet, I don't make money off of my photography yet.  Actually, well I have.  Actually, a couple of people said, "Oh, uh, I'm a model and I need some shots" so I would do shots for them.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  It's not a whole lotta money, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  Huh.  Do you do digital photography or do you use thirty five millimeter or ...?
L:  Actually, I used to use thirty five millimeter but when digital cameras came out, that was like -- that was great because you don't have to spend a lotta money on film, you can just take your pictures and you can even adjust them on the computer.  I think digital cameras are great.
R:  Yeah, I just got one [LAUGH], so I'm -- I -- I like to take pictures to but I've never really done it a lot.
L:  Yeah, well the best thing about a digital camera is you can take a billion pictures and never have to pay to have them developed.  Just, um --
R:  Yeah, I thought that would be a great thing.
L:  Yeah, you put 'em on your computer and if you wanna get 'em printed there's plenty of places online that'll print 'em out for you so you could have 'em and put in your album and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But you're not paying that fee like, you -- before I'd get a roll of film developed and maybe there would be like, out of thirty maybe ten really good pictures.
R:  Yeah, I know what you mean! [LAUGH]
L:  But I had to pay, you know, to get the whole roll done.  This way you just delete what you don't like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you don't have to pay for anything.
R:  Yeah, I thought that would be great for like, when I go traveling or something --
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- 'cause I do that all the time, I take a hundred pictures and I really only have two or three that turn out.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know.  'Cause I'm still learning how to take pictures and so they don't always turn out real well.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I would tell you a secret with, um, digital cameras.  Um, sometimes your best pictures are gonna come when you don't use a flash.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  As many -- as much as possible try to use natural light, especially when you're outside.  Just turn the flash off and take pictures like that and see how it works.  I rarely ever use a flash for even -- even --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- at nighttime or even when it's cloudy I rarely ever use a flash because if you have a digital camera a lotta times it will adjust to the light.
R:  Okay.
L:  And if you use a flash, a flash just bounces all over the place --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and makes people look washed out.
R:  Oh.
L:  It makes -- you know, it washes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the color out of everything.  So try without a flash.  It -- it might work better for you.
R:  Oh yeah.  And it -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  D- digital cameras run on battery, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  D- d- but the ba- -- do the batteries last a long time or ...?
L:  Well, my digital camera, I went out and bought rechargeable batteries.
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.
L:  So what I do is like, every night I put 'em in the charger and I'm good for the next day.
R:  Oh.
L:  And for some reason this camera doesn't burn up the batteries like I would think it would, so sometimes the batteries will last me two or three days.
R:  Wow.
L:  Like, I've done a --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- whole like, three hour shoot without changing the batteries.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  That's working -- yeah, that's really good.  So, [LIPSMACK] besides just a camera, I recommend rechargeable batteries for anything, especially like --
R:  That makes a lotta sense.
L:  -- double A. and triple A. you save so much money.  You'll pay twenty dollars for four batteries but you don't have to buy batteries again for another three years.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know what I mean?  So, like, if you can imagine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how much money you save.
R:  Well, I guess photography might be my new hobby! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  We're gonna see how it goes. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  I also thought it'd be fun to be able to take pictures of my dogs, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- yeah, that's pretty cool.  If you could take good pictures maybe you could like, do, um, greeting cards or something or --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- you know, you can even sell -- if you c- -- if your pictures come out really interesting and really cool, like, there's some art stock places that would [NOISE] buy them from you.
R:  Wow, cool! [LAUGH]
L:  You know. [LAUGH]
R:  Then it wouldn't be a hobby anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  I love -- I -- I wouldn't -- that's what I was saying, I want like a little tiny dog, something that doesn't get any bigger than a cat.
R:  Oh well --
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  It depends on y- -- my friends have a cat that weighs twenty eight pounds so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, a normal cat!
R:  It kinda depends what size cat you have in mind! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, a normal cat! [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.
L:  Well, I --
R:  Well my dog -- my dog weighs thirteen pounds.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And a lotta cats are bigger than her.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, you know, she's not real tiny like a chihuahua or something.
L:  Yeah.  I want something little though.  I want something tiny that you can just pick up and carry.
R:  And stick in your purse, right?
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]  Yeah.  My boyfriend's like, "It's not really a dog unless it weighs a hundred pounds".
R:  Yeah, I know, men are like that.
L:  Yeah.  I'm like, "No".
R:  But I don't know.
L:  I don't like big dogs.
R:  Well, have you ever had mini -- they have mini shiatsus now.
L:  Oh really?
R:  That only weigh like, five pounds.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well thirteen pounds is pretty small actually.
R:  It's pretty small.  I mean, I -- she wouldn't fit in my purse but I do carry her around and I used to carry her around in my gym bag.
L:  Oh wow.  They're so cute though --
R:  When I first had her.
L:  -- with all that hair.
R:  Yeah.  It -- they're a lotta work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  That's why y- you know, it almost -- you [LAUGH] -- people who have dogs should know what they're getting into.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I certainly wouldn't recommend, you know, people just started breeding dogs as a hobby 'cause, uh, it took me a long time to learn how to do it, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, I was looking at, um, pugs, and then I did -- went online and I researched them and they were saying, like, they have a lotta breathing problems --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have a lotta this.  So yeah, I -- I definitely believe if you're gonna do anything you should do the research on it, just to see, you know, what the different aspects of it are.
R:  Oh yeah.  'Cause, I mean, even if you're doing it in your spare time, nobody has an endless amount of spare time.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  You know.  No matter how much you wanna spend all your time on your hobbies, I mean, you just can't do it.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  That's definitely true. [LAUGH]
R:  Life kinda gets in the way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would think. [LAUGH]
L:  That's definitely true.  Yeah, I have a --
R:  Although I suppose that kinda depends on your age too, I mean, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- if you're retired or if you're really young you probably don't have that problem.
L:  Right.  No, I have an eleven year old, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Huh.  You have a lotta time constraints. [LAUGH] 
L:  My time is definitely split.  Yeah, time is definitely split.  You know, but --
R:  You know what the good thing about hobbies like yours is though?
L:  Mhm.
R:  When you get older and you retire, you already have something that you can spend all your time doing and you'll love it.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I -- that's what I was telling my sisters, like, I -- I can't wait to get a house where I can just have one room where I can do my painting and, you know, and then when I get older, you know, that is definitely something I can fall back on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and travel more, like once my daughter gets of age where she can ... take a hike! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, then --
R:  Because I do think, you know, people who don't have hobbies, when they retire they're just lost.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  You know.  They don't know what to do with their time.
L:  I agree.  I cannot -- my compu- -- I work for myself so I'm always on the computer.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my computer broke down for three weeks.  So for --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- three weeks I'm like, on the couch, I'm like, making outfits for my daughter's Barbies.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm doing this, I'm drawing, I'm doing this, I'm doing -- and it's like, I know that if I had endless amounts of free time I could always find something to do.
R:  Yeah, I think some people are just like that, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Not idle.
R:  Some people, I mean, just like your -- it's like, silly to ask you what your hobbies are because probably, I mean, you just create them as you go along. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  It's hard to have idle hands [NOISE] ... you know --
R:  Yeah, exactly [MN].
L:  -- you always wanna be busy doing something.
R:  Yeah.  Well, having a dog will keep you busy. [LAUGH]
L:  I bet.  I used to -- actually my roommate used to have a dog.  It was a mix between a Pit and a Rottweiler.
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  He was huge.  He was like a hundred and fifty pounds.
R:  [SIGH].
L:  He was just sweet as he wanted to be.  He was -- he -- he had the heart [LAUGH] -- the body --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of a lion and the heart of a pussycat.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's just so big and so much responsibility.
R:  Yeah, and you know --
L:  And you gotta wash 'em and --
R:  And large dogs --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- don't live as long --
L:  Really?
R:  -- as small dogs.  The average lifespan of a large dog is ten years whereas with a small dog it can be twenty years or twenty five years.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, they just have a lot more health problems.
L:  And I -- you know, we wound up, when we moved we had to give him away and a really nice family took him.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  But it was just like, wow, the responsibility of that dog.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Just the fact that any dog, you have to walk it like three or four times a day.  It's like, oh my God.
R:  Well, I don't have to --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- walk my dogs because my dogs are litterbox trained.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Oh I'm serious, yeah.  As long
