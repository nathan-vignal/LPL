R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi!
R:  Hello?  [SIGH]
L:  I'm Glen.
R:  I'm ... Carla.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, Carla.  [MN]  Ah, gosh I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, [SIGH] I'm pretty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- busy.  I, um, I work, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out of my home but I also travel quite a bit on the road.  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I can honestly say that I never sit and watch the news on television ever.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I --
R:  I do.  [SIGH]
L:  Pardon?
R:  [NOISE]  I like watching it on TV.  [NOISE]
L:  On what?
R:  The TV.  [NOISE]
L:  On TV?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yep.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I guess I'm -- I'm so --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- jealous.  If I have time to --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- sit down and watch TV, the last thing I want to do is --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- watch the news.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And I get up so early in the morning that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the news comes on so late at night honestly [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I wonder what that was?
R:  [NOISE]  That's what I was [NOISE] just [LAUGH] going to say.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I don't know what that was.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what that was either.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I guess we'll ignore it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But, anyway, I was going to say I'm very rarely up that late at night so --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [MN] a- ah, you know, I usually --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- catch most of my news on the radio.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, I'm a stay at home mom so all I do is watch TV.  When they're not watching TV -- [SIGH] they're not watching cartoons, I'll watch the news.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like just to see really -- what's -- kind of what's going on in the world.  That's about it.
L:  I probably watch the news more whenever the war was going on.  Just because I was so drawn to it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- kind of like during nine eleven.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's --
L:  So, ...
R:  -- I was.
L:  But [MN] um, I honestly can say I usually try to avoid the news if I can, you know, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- if I'm in the car and it comes on, on the radio, I listen to it.  But [SIGH] I know I'm guilty of really not keeping up on the current events, because [COUGH] I can be with a group and someone will mention something and I'm [SIGH] -- a lot of times embarrassed inwardly because I [MN] don't have any idea or a clue and then, finally, say, "Well heck didn't you hear about, [SIGH] you know, the little girl who was kidnapped?" or whatever and I'm -- I'm oblivious, you know?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  It seems like whenever I do watch the news it's all b- [LAUGH] bad news.
R:  That's --
L:  It's very rarely uplifting.  [SIGH]
R:  It's true -- that's -- it's never -- and you never hear any -- really anything good out of the news.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]  All you hear is t- the bad.
L:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  Well, and --
R:  You know what I mean.  I like --
L:  -- we live up --
R:  -- to hear the good stuff too.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] i- it would be nice if they'd at least do some good stuff.  [SIGH]  We live out in the country so we're --
R:  That's where we are.
L:  -- on a satellite dish.  [SIGH]
R:  That's us.
L:  And, ah, we get, um, ABC as a -- as a direct feed from either New York or LA [SIGH] and you c- certainly --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- don't want to listen to those stations for news because it's all --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- bad, you know.
R:  Well we -- we've got the satellite also.  We've got the direct TV satellite.
L:  Yeah, that's what we have too.
R:  And they -- they have our local news channels on there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know what that [LAUGH] noise is.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Is that a test to see if we can stay on?  [LAUGH]
R:  Do what?
L:  [SIGH]  It -- may be it's a test to see if we can stay on with the noises that they're going to give us.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I mean [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- might as well.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I guess the news that I do listen to -- I live in Texas and I live, ah, almost on the Oklahoma border [SIGH] is I do p- pay special attention to the, ah, -- [SIGH] to the weather warnings --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- that they have on TV.  I know that's not real news but, to me, that's, ah, [SIGH] that's important news around here I know --
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's --
L:  -- tonight they have a tornado warning.
R:  -- you see -- I live in -- I live in Tennessee.  I live in -- well, I live in the m- middle of Tennessee.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, you know, we had all that bad weather.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean I was glued to the TV.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, so --
R:  I mean with something like that I think most people are, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, glued to the TV when stuff like that's going on.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know, like the nine eleven stuff, people was glued to the TV then.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And with the war stuff people was glued to the TVs.
L:  My husband actually wanted to watch CNN while the war was going on instead of --
R:  I did.
L:  -- instead of +regular TV and I'm like, "No".  That's where I put my [LAUGH] foot down --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, I just [SIGH] -- you know, -- so we would end up watching separate TV 'cause he can just watch CNN or Fox or one of the news channels --
R:  That's what I done [SIGH] --
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  -- during the war I mean I -- I was glued to those two channels pretty much.  [SIGH]
L:  I just -- I don't know I guess, ah --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I like to live in my own little dream world and not have reality shoved in my face so much but, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I -- I truly think that -- ah, I -- I remember m- -- Jerry's parents who -- who are both dead now.  [SIGH]  I mean they wouldn't miss a newscast.  I mean they just --
R:  Oh, I know people like that.
L:  -- you know, they're -- they were the type --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that they watched every time the news came on [SIGH] and they couldn't understand why I just -- you know, could've cared less about it.  So, I don't know whether it's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- a cultural thing or an age thing or -- you know, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know what it is but I --
R:  I -- I don't know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  But I mean I -- I like watching it.  I mean I like seeing you know, -- I like to know what's going on in the world but I mean I would also like to see the good stuff too.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  'Cause I mean I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I couldn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I couldn't tell you the last time really I heard something good on the news.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, I mean all you ever hear is the bad stuff.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I mean I -- I don't understand why they don't put the good stuff on there too.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, and you know I --
R:  Because I mean I know there's got -- somewhere there's good --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- going on.
L:  [LAUGH]  There's got to be something.  [SIGH]  I guess i- it's not really news but I prefer to watch, like, if I'm home [SIGH] and have the time ... if something like the Today Show or something that there's more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- newsy type rather than just bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, you know, here's this, here's this, here's this, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I guess I like that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like on Saturday morning, and I can't remember which channel it is but they have [SIGH] like, I think it's called the Today Show on Saturday or something.  [SIGH]  But it's a way to sort of get the news but it's not in such a hard drilled down, um, [SIGH] fashion, it's like the ten o'clock news is.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  You know, it's more [SIGH] "All right.  Here's a little piece of news" and then "Now we'll do this one on ... how to b- bake a cake" you know?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I find that more palatable.
R:  Yeah, I like -- I like that stuff too.  I mean that, you know, that -- that breaks it up.  I mean that's -- it's -- [NOISE] I mean it's not good stuff but [SIGH] you know, I mean it's -- a lot of it's interesting and I mean you learn stuff off that stuff -- kind of shows.
L: Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But I mean -- they're -- for the news I mean all you do is [SIGH] -- you hear the bad.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, and I mean I get tired of hearing just the bad stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And you know, I guess my daughter's twenty seven -- I was going to say, probably whenever she was little and I wasn't a stay at home mom [SIGH] I guess I did watch the news more, because I had to stay up on what was going on [LAUGH] locally.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And plus I always wondered what the weather was going to be like and how to dress her for school.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And now that it's just my husband and I, you know, [SIGH] ah, it -- it's just -- I don't know whether it's not as important or [SIGH] [MN] excuse me or, um, ... where the difference is but I think probably the older I've gotten [SIGH] the less I've wanted to watch the news.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean I know a lot of people like that.  I mean I know a lot of younger people that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] -- that wants to hear it, you know -- you know, that wants to watch the news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then the other lot that doesn't.  Then the -- you know, the older people they're -- I know a lot that like watching the news and, you know, some don't.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, and see that's -- that seems just the opposite for me because all of the older people [LAUGH] it seems like [LAUGH] -- like to watch the news.  Of course I don't consider myself super old yet.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But [SIGH] -- but I seem to be [LAUGH] j- just the opposite in that the older I get the less I want to watch.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think that the people who, um, produce the news if they would [SIGH] -- if they would make it, um, more -- I don't know use- -- user friendly -- if it's the politically correct word, or whatever, but if they would make it more [SIGH] entertaining.  I mean I know they have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- put all of the [SIGH] -- I -- I like the news whenever they'll do like features on [SIGH] like new drugs or something --
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  -- that's coming out in about health or [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, those types of, you know, where it's not just who murdered who and [SIGH] you know, --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- which political candidate is on the land and --
R:  [SIGH]  That's something that -- I mean here lately -- well, the last -- this [NOISE] last presidential e- +election thing.  [SIGH]  You know, I -- I used to -- well I did partic- -- but I mean it -- I just got so aggravated with it.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know, I just -- I didn't want to watch it.  I could care less about it.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, and I know when nine eleven was -- I got overloaded.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just -- [SIGH] e- enough was enough.  I mean you couldn't go on any channel and watch anything but [SIGH] ... what was going on and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- after about a week of it I had had enough.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I found myself just not even watching TV because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or watching old reruns of I Love Lucy because I just was not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going to [SIGH] be subjected, you know, I mean it -- it depressed me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I mean just to watch it over and over.  And [SIGH] I was glad that the war was over as quick as it was because I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- was starting to feel that way about it.  [SIGH]
R:  Yep.  [NOISE]  I mean some things you know, they just sit and dwell on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  And then other things they don't.  And the stuff that they sit and dwell on a lot of people, you know, doesn't care and the stuff that people really care about, [SIGH] you know, they -- they say something, you know, maybe one time on the news and then you never hear it again, and "We'll follow up on it" and they never do.  That -- that aggravates me.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  You know, if something that I really -- you know, I would really like to listen -- you know, about [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and then you never hear anything else about it.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, or what -- irritate me especially since we have ABC -- you know, the big east coast and west coast, ah, stations [SIGH] is they'll have a teaser on about something that's going to be on the news [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, and then you never see it.
L:  -- it will sound like something really exciting.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, of course, then they have it on in the last five minutes and it's absolutely nothing.  
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And I just feel ... like they took me --you know --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- to get me to watch their stupid news program.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, 'cause they'll -- they'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- blow it so out of proportion that you really think, "Oh, this is gonna be [SIGH] really worth listening to --"
R:  And when you come to find out it's not.
L:  "-- you know, it's really something I need to stay up for" you know, [SIGH] and, um, like I say then they'll [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, it's like me.  I've got -- I've got a four year old and I've got a ... seven week old ba- --
