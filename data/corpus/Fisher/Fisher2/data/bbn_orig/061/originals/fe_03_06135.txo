L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  Hi!  [NOISE]
R:  Hi!  Go ahead!
L:  [NOISE]  I'm -- hi, my name's Jackie.  Oh!  [NOISE]
R:  Okay, I'm Mary.
L:  Hi, Mary.
R:  Hello.
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have you done one of these before?
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Um, [NOISE] yeah, so I guess we're supposed to be talking about how we get news?
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  That's an unusual topic choice.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, well I guess they have to come up with something [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Yeah, I suppose that's true.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [MN] well you go ahead and talk and then I'll ch- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- chime in when you finish.  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  Well, all right, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, I usually get information from my friends.  That's -- and I mean sometimes I'll get -- I'll look through the newspaper or ... check stuff on line but most of my information comes from my friends, [NOISE] what's going on.  But ...
R:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Um, well, I'm bombarded with media from every angle.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH]  I have the radio on when I'm h- home during the day [SIGH] usually and I have it on in my car.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I always listen to talk radio.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  So, I get a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- current events off of the, you know, radio programs.  [SIGH]  And then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] we get a few newspapers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at our house [LAUGH] and so I constantly have newspapers that I'm behind on the reading.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  I used to try to keep up with my school's newspaper.  So, that -- I go to college.
R:  You're a college student?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different when you're in college, I think.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  'Cause your priorities are studying and things like that so ...  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Yeah, it's like the stuff that you're interested in it tends to be, [NOISE] you know, what's going on, on campus, you know.  [NOISE]  And ... even, you know, what's going on in, ah, [NOISE] in politics to some extent but nothing, [NOISE] you know, you're not too concerned about [NOISE] too much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's not part of campus, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I -- well, during the war [SIGH] stuff I was on line a lot.  I was watching, ah, reading like these Blogs[?] websites --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that they have.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  That people -- that were, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, keeping logs of what was happening [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [SIGH] -- and then just checking like the drudgery --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- part a lot.  And [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, this one had one called last remote dot com and it had all the different news web sites, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, altogether there so you could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go to any of 'em.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  And that was interesting because you'd usually be able to see things on there ahead of what you'd hear on TV.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [NOISE]  That's kind of cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, it -- with the war information I mean, [NOISE] I was constantly getting different [NOISE] -- different information from my friends on that.  [NOISE]  Like they all had widely different opinions on it and [NOISE] they were giving me different [NOISE] sources of information [NOISE] [SIGH] -- ah --
R:  Are you outside?
L:  Yeah, actually, I am.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I can hear a lot of wind noise from the phone.
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Yeah --
R:  It happens on my daughter's too when she calls from outside on her cellphone.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I'm actually at a graduation picnic right now.
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  So, it's like I'm -- I'm out in the middle of nowhere.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, I see.
L:  [NOISE]  But I had my -- [SIGH] I had my phone on me because I was waiting for a  call from [NOISE] someone else.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, and then that came in?
L:  [NOISE]  I got this -- and I'm just like, "Oh, yeah, sure fine I'll take it, why not?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, um, let's see.  I -- I get current events too, sometimes my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- comes home he hears things that I don't and then he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- passes them on to me and I say, " [SIGH] Oh, how did I miss out on that?  'Cause I had the radio on and I didn't hear anything about it".  But [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, I guess that we have little local me- -- ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- newspapers that come too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that [SIGH] -- they're like free papers that they just deliver to all the people that live in our suburb.  [MN]
L:  Oh, that's kind of nice.
R:  And so I stay up on the l- local things [SIGH] through that.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And then I do belong to a, um, like a web mailing group, I forget what the official name is, about the local politics.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And local to the, like, the state level mostly.  You know, i- it covers some of the local +elections -- elections to do with school board and stuff like that too and [SIGH] those are hot items.  [SIGH]  But right now there's not anything going on as far as --
L:  Not a whole lot.
R:  -- the elections.  So, [SIGH] there hasn't been too much besides things to do with -- I live in Minnesota.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  There's been a lot of things to do with cutting taxes here because there's so many, ah, shortfalls with the government for the amount of money that they need [SIGH] for --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- all the programs.
L:  -- they're making cuts everywhere.
R:  Yeah.  What state are you in?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, Illinois.
R:  Illinois?  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, [SIGH] they -- they're doing a lot of cuts like our campus --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my sister's coming down to the school [SIGH] next year and -- and the tuition hike is about a thousand dollars [NOISE] difference between her semester, compared to what I was paying.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh!  Yeah, they're raising the ... tuition for, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for the state colleges around here too.
L:  State school.  Yeah.
R:  Drastically.  So, [SIGH] they're telling people to look at, um, private colleges so they might get a better deal actually now at private colleges.  So, [SIGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I'm not sure for how long, you know, but they can give better financial --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aid I think.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, yeah, when you go to a private you can u- usually get better [NOISE] -- better help but, [SIGH] that's -- that amazes me that [NOISE] the prices are getting -- the pushed hikes are getting that bad.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Now, why -- and you probably pay more attention to the college stuff than I do since I haven't really -- [SIGH] my daughter has graduated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from college and I'm not paying for anybody right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm glad that's behind me, you know.  But ...
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  And then it's hard to justify it now too because with the job market the way it's been [SIGH] you know, you spend a lot of money on a college education and there's --
L:  And then you get out and there's ... no jobs!
R:  Right, it's pretty depressing right now.  So, ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I --
L:  But it -- it's sort of one of those things that a college degree, you kind of need it, you know, in today's m- market.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  [SIGH]  It's hard --
R:  I think so too.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's better to have it.  Even if you're coming out and ... have to start waitressing for a while, you're still going to need that diploma, it's -- I [NOISE] think.
R:  Right.  Well, from the way it sounds I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- p- pretty soon the tech stuff will take off again, so [SIGH] then it will be --
L:  I'm hoping so.
R:  -- the technical degrees will mean something again.  But right now I think --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- we're kind of overloaded with [SIGH] people aren't -- you know, looking for jobs that have, ah, high technical skills and stuff.  So, [SIGH] at least --
L:  [NOISE]  Well, my parents -- my parents tell me that we went through ... a recession like this in the eighties, so I'm hoping it'll pick up again soon.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Actually I was hired by a company in the early eighties --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- during the ... l- last type of +recession -- [SIGH] recession that they had.  [SIGH]  I mean --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I was hired in eighty one.  [SIGH]  So, [SIGH] may be it was under --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:   -- a jobs creation program --
L:  How would --
R:  -- or something that they had then.
L:  That's when I was born.  [LAUGH]
R:  In eighty one?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, well that was, um, -- well I was actually later for me because I was an older [SIGH] -- I went back and I was an older student then [SIGH] and got a --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- job after that.  So, ...  [SIGH] and, um, well I think maybe there are cycles but this one does seem pretty serious.  I guess, [SIGH] at the time back then I wasn't worried.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know, maybe I should have been, but now I -- I'm worried because I see people all around losing their jobs.  So ...  [SIGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  Go ahead.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, sorry -- yeah, I know I have friends that are having some trouble because of the -- I actually just graduated yesterday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  Well, congratulations.
L:  Thank you.
R:  But friends that are having trouble finding jobs, or ...?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  It -- it's I mean -- they'll find jobs but not -- not good ones.  You know, we're finding things like [SIGH] you know, in the minimum wage, ah, bracket when -- with college degrees you're coming out with waitressing and secretary and --
R:  What kind of degrees are they?
L:  [MN]  Um, things like Computer Si and --
R:  Oh, they're still like technical degrees then?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And they're having that much trouble finding the jobs, even with those kind of degrees?  [SIGH]  I thought maybe they were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, psy- psychology or ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually, that would be me.  [LAUGH]
R:  That would be you?
L:  Coming out -- coming out with psycho.
R:  Okay, and what kind of jobs are you finding?
L:  [NOISE]  Ah, well right now I'm still looking.  I haven't found one yet.  Um, but I -- I have a couple of places I'm looking -- I'm trying to get ... into a -- ah, -- right now I'm looking into stuff like crisis lines and ... retirement homes, things that are -- that allow a Bachelor degree.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  'Cause it -- it's kind of hard to find a psych -- a, psy- -- a psych job [NOISE] at the Bachelor's level.  [NOISE]
R:  You need the Master's, is that what you're saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Which [SIGH] I do plan on getting a Masters but, ah, I need to start ... w- working in the field now and getting experience.  [LIPSMACK]  It's like I'm working on the Masters Degree but also trying to get a job.
R:  Yeah, because you need the experience, huh?
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  So, it's like I'm trying to find jobs that allow you to start [NOISE] working at the Bachelor's level.  And it's -- it's pretty much stuff like crisis lines and retirement homes and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- women's shelters, that sort of thing.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I have a friend who's near the same age as I am, close to being fifty, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and she's just opening her own practice [SIGH] for consulting ... psychologist in the Chicago area.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  And she's completed -- I know she's finished her Masters and so she's even higher up than that now and she's working on some other programs at the same time.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, it was always her thing that she wanted to do that and she started, you know, later in life and --
L:  So, then she's the one who's in charge of it?
R:  I guess.
L:  Like, starting it up?  [MN]  Oh --
R:  For herself -- just, you know, for her own practice.
L:  Well, you can g- get good money if you get your own practice going.
R:  Yeah, she might -- I think she's working with some other people, you know, in a group or something.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I didn't hear a lot of details about what it is, but I have the feeling that's already a -- a -- group of them that was established and that [SIGH] she's joining with their group or whatever.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But it's still private practice, as far as I know, you know, it's --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- individual still.
L:  -- I mean if you get a good private practice going and you can get references and people coming in, you can make good money.
R:  Well I --
L:  That's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah, I would think too that a lot of it is dependent on, um, contracts that come in from, you know, like [SIGH] say school districts and things like that too.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]  So, I'm not sure, you know, b- -- how that's going to be effected with the way budget cuts are.  I would think that a lot of those k- kinds of contracts are going to be [SIGH] cut back on, you know, at least in the near future.  So, ...
L:  Uh-hum.  Well, [SIGH] yeah, I don't know, ... budget cutting all over the place.  I mean I'm not sure what's going to happen.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, as far as a current event, though, it looks like we're getting ready for a storm here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, actually, we've got some thunderheads up in the sky too.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  We were supposed to get rain off and on all day.  It hasn't rained yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, are you in a suburb of Chicago?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, no, actually, I'm down at -- um, Urbana-Champaign, Havana.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Right in the middle of the state.  But ...
R:  Right in the middle?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I'm familiar with that area too.  We drive through there sometimes --
