L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  Yes, hello.
R:  [LAUGH]  This is very exciting.  I've never done this before.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I know, this i- -- this is, ah, really different.  This is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- second one.
R:  [MN]
L:  It is fun.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm Cathy from Pennsylvania.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I'm Kelly from New York.  [NOISE]
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  You too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I guess we have to talk about --
R:  How --
L:  -- how we hear about current events.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, why don't you start?  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well I -- I [SIGH] have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the TV on all the time.  And between --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the TV and computer that's how I g- get most of what's going on.
R:  [SIGH]  I -- mostly through friends, [LAUGH] actually.
L:  Through what?
R:  Through friends.  Other people.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  [NOISE]  And, ah, huh, well the others tell me and I'll -- and I'll watch TV so much and [NOISE] I'm on the Internet all day.  But [SIGH] current events I guess I just hear about it [NOISE] from people at work mostly, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- popular culture ... through my roommate.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, about what's going on and ah, --
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  -- if someone calls --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then I might turn the TV on and -- to a specific --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- channel to try and hear what's [SIGH] -- more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- information on that.
R:  [NOISE]  Right.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Usually, I do that.  Yeah, or my parents will [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tell me something a couple of days later.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Or --
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, I work in television [LAUGH] but I don't watch it so much --
L:  Oh, see --
R:  -- for current events.
L:  -- there you go!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, you probably hear things at work too.
R:  Oh, yeah, ... all the time.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Or in the car, on the radio, I mean --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that's how I hear --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- things too.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, no -- yeah, that's how [SIGH] [NOISE] I used to when I drove you know, and, you know -- moving to New York you just [NOISE] don't need to drive.  [NOISE]  The radio was a big source, --
L:  Right.  Right.  So, ...
R:  -- [NOISE] NPR especially.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  You're right in the city then ... for --
R:  [NOISE]  Um, actually, I'm in Queens but, yeah, it -- it's the city still, [SIGH] [NOISE] sort of.
L:  Oh, okay.  My husband's born and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bred in Brooklyn.  So, I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- -- I know, you know, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- current events happen in [NOISE] New York.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, they [LAUGH] do.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And in fact when -- well, when the World Trade Center h- happened --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my m- mom actually called --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and told me.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually I was one of the first people on my floor to know [SIGH] 'cause, um, [MN] -- well, the channel I work for it's, you know, it's [NOISE] -- it's documentary nature television [NOISE] it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if it moves so we -- it's usually turned on to that all day.  [NOISE]  And so she called from Arkansas [NOISE] [LAUGH] where everybody was like, "Turn on the news.  Turn on the news".
L:  Oh, my, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so you're hearing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- New York news from Arkansas.
R:  [NOISE]  I know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I know.  It's -- it's kind of ridiculous.  [SIGH]  But, ah, ... [SIGH]
L:  It is.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But see there's -- goes to show --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you just how we can --
R:  [NOISE]  Communicate fast enough.
L:  -- current events.  Yep.  Yep.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know.
R:  [COUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  Well, I guess then this is my second one --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that I do and sometimes you get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to that point where you just don't know what to sa- -- what else to say.
R:  Say.
L:  But, um ...
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, I think this a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a great --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- program and ...
R:  [NOISE]  How did you find out about it?
L:  Through the Internet.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] Craig's List.  [LAUGH]
L:  Just some people, you know, saying, "Hey --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- you know, give 'em a call --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- see if you qualify".
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  So, every little bit helps.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, --
L:  Which --
R:  -- [NOISE] I um
L:  -- falls in under current events too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  We use a lot of -- well some specific research information [NOISE] in [SIGH] advertising --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]  -- to find out about consumers, you know, [SIGH] if they watch our channel, what kind of consumer watches our channel.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, usually I never get to qualify for any of these things though, [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  Well, I'm --
R:  -- because of the industry I'm in.  But [NOISE] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whoa!  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Well, that helps.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That sure does.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I know we used to use the -- the n- newspaper a lot too but [SIGH] with everyone's busy schedule --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we had to cancel the newspaper, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because we don't have time to --
R:  To read it.  [NOISE]
L:  -- sit down and read it.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  So, ah --
R:  [COUGH]  Yeah, our schedule most of the newspapers out there just you can get the top [NOISE] [inaudible] day sent to you.
L:  Oh, you can.  That's right.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, you can [NOISE] ... get an email electronic version of the [SIGH] newspaper that day.  [NOISE]  So, ...
L:  Right and -- and that's how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I find out a lot of things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on -- on various lists that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm on.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Someone will post, "Oh, my God, did you hear about this?"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you go searching to find --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some more information.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  Put the TV on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what have you.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, no, I don't know how determined[?] you are [LAUGH] [NOISE] to say what's your -- what's the best n- national news [NOISE] channel, like talks, CNN --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- MSNBC.  Is there one in particular [NOISE] --
L:  I like --
R:  -- you trust more than the other?  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I watched, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially with the war situation and everything, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I watched a lot of CNN and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] Fox News.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually I think it all pertained --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- to what channel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I had on.
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  If I were w- watching --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- soaps in the afternoon then it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would come on CBS.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  [NOISE]
L:  So, ah, --
R:  Yeah, they were covering it all the time then.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And, ah, I mean sometimes I'd feel too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the current events --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] don't you feel that, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tell too much sometimes?
R:  Sometimes, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And sometimes there's too many different s- stories going on.  [NOISE]  
L:  And then you create a panic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with everyone and, --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- yeah, I don't think we hear everything but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] um, I like to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- informed but, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know about all the detail.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Like having all those reporters with different- -- particular units [NOISE] ... out in, [SIGH] ah, [SIGH] -- on the -- the war on Iraq.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  Having r- reporters with 'em -- I don't -- I don't know if they should have been there.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I -- I you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you question --
R:  Does it -- [NOISE]
L:  -- does it interfere with anything that they're doing or --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're putting your own li- -- they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- putting their lives --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at stake.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  So, I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- k- know if I would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- r- really, really care to do that.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Oh, no, no [LAUGH] way, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  But some of 'em really get into it and I --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- I admire that too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But [SIGH] I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if it [MN] has to do with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] feeding the public what's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going on.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]  Just compared to, you know, some of the other war coverage [NOISE] in our lives that was --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was just, "Oh, my gosh!"  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, it was kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like the unknown, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you had no idea what was gong on.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, I -- I look back at like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I was in high school with the Vietnam War, --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean you just didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you h- hardly knew --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anything about it except --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for what you read in the paper.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  And that was it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then when they went over to --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- for the Desert Storm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] we started hearing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more and more.  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- CNN I guess got that --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, this --
L:  -- ... underway.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [SIGH]  Technology.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'd be lost without my computer.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean [SIGH] I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like I said I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I get a lot of the current events through that and --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's been a big asset.
R:  [NOISE]  I -- see I was asking people at work I said, "What would we do without the Internet or email [LAUGH] any more?"  I was like, "I'm trying [SIGH] to remember -- I've had jobs where we didn't -- when -- before email and all that stuff and the world wide web and [SIGH] how did we function?"  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  Because now you can find out anything, you know?  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I know and I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I look at that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I -- well I've been at home for f- five years --
R:  [NOISE]  [inaudible]  [NOISE]
L:  -- like housebound [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of the time.  It's getting better, don't get me wrong --
R:  [NOISE]  Okay.
L:  -- [SIGH] but without the Internet [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I would have been --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at a loss.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  I think it keeps me out of getting into a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- depression.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  You know there's an outside world out there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  So, it makes --
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
L:  -- it nice.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just keeps you informed as to what's going on.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  I don't know how we lived without it --
R:  [MN]  [NOISE]
L:  -- either.
R:  See -- well [LAUGH] my parents finally got ... the Internet, like, l- last year.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  I was like, "You're so [LAUGH] behind."  [NOISE]
L:  That's probably, a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a big hit with them now?
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, [LAUGH] that and cable television.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes ... yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, actually, it's satellite they don't -- they live in a place where they can't even get [NOISE] c- cable.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, hey --
R:  [NOISE]  It's --
L:  -- I know that's a step forward there for parents anyway.
R:  [NOISE]  Right, that -- or there's somebody other then Les Limbyer[?] out there --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] on the radio.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That's right.  [SIGH]  That's r- right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, "Why am I -- [NOISE] [LAUGH] like now he's on TV".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  I guess he still is.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Well, I -- I look at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too with the Internet, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was just able to connect with my husband's -- some family that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- are out in California now.
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and hadn't talked to them in years.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it was just so neat.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That, yeah, and -- ah, my mother really she's been talking to cousins -- exactly and people -- [SIGH] [NOISE] which she has not seen in thirty years.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  So, yeah.
L:  It's nice.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I guess that has to do with current --
R:  It does.  [NOISE]
L:  -- events as well.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I think so.
R:  [SIGH]  Yes.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  It's part of communication --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and finding out what's going on.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Where do you -- ah, how do you find out your entertainment news?  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Through a particular website or do --
L:  I just --
R:  -- you don't care about [LAUGH] entertainment news like [NOISE] [inaudible].
L:  Well, sometimes it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just like through Yahoo or --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- something like that.  It --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, it's on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there and [SIGH] ah, maybe various newsletters that come out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- e- each day.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we keep informed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that way.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  But, I know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I hear of a -- a movie or something coming out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of course then I'll research it and see -- find -- try to find out more on it [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, ah, yeah.
L:  -- with the good old Internet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  So, yes, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's a major, major plus.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, most of the time my -- my roommate [NOISE] goes to like every movie out there so I'll just [NOISE] take it from him.  [LAUGH]  I won't wait.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Or, ah, [SIGH] or, um, ah, his movie mag- --
