R: Uh, my name is Linda Farley.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Dora Hadley from Albion, Nebraska. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh, how are you doing, Dora?
L:  Oh, real fine.  How about you?
R:  Pretty good.
L:  Oh, that's good. [NOISE] Um --
R:  Huh, um --
L:  What was our topic supposed to be [NOISE] on now again?  I didn't quite understand her.
R:  Current events.  Like, uh --
L:  Oh, current events.
R:  Yeah, what's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- happening in the world now and how do we get it over the, uh, [SIGH] -- now that's what I think it is because --
L:  Yes.
R:  Sh- -- it said current events and how do I get most of my, uh, information through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- newspapers, or what?
L:  Right.  How do you get your current [NOISE] events then?  What --
R:  Well --
L:  -- do you enjoy the most?
R:  Well, you know, Dora, a lot of it I get over the internet.
L:  Oh.  I have --
R:  I --
L:  -- never tried that.
R:  Oh, you don't -- you don't have access to the internet?
L:  I've got internet but I don't try it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, listen, y- -- if you go to the internet and --
L:  What do you use?
R:  Uh, well --
L:  What source?
R:  Uh, well, I just go to my, uh, Yahoo -- like I've got Yahoo and my --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- front page will come up with all the current events.  It may have fifteen or twenty of 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I key on -- on what I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- want to, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, uh, to, um, uh, you know, read up on or -- and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It'll be like -- if it's two o'clock in the morning -- sometimes I sit up to two o'clock in the morning just --
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Sure.
R:  -- just going on the inter- -- I kn- -- I know a lot of people say, "How do you sit there?"  But --
L:  Yeah, how do you stay awake? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] W- well, I'm retired.
L:  I see.  I see.
R:  I'm retired and so -- well, I was forced into retirement --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- because I worked for Lucid Technologies, part of AT&T and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they closed -- a lot of that closed down, you know.
L:  Sure, uh-huh.
R:  But what do you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think about the, uh, war in Iraq?  I mean, do you --
L:  Oh, um --
R:  Do you think -- or terrorism.  Do you think that, uh, [SIGH] we're gonna come --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out ahead or we're gonna all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get killed. [LAUGH] 
L:  I keep hoping that we're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gonna face --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- terroristic threat.  You know, that we do [NOISE] somehow get rid of the terrorists.  I [NOISE] know it's [NOISE] probably impossible [NOISE] but I do feel we need to work really hard and even right here in the homeland actually.
R:  You know, it's really scary, isn't it?
L:  Yes.  I, uh --
R:  Especially at airports, you know, uh --
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, I don't -- I'm -- I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I was afraid to take aeroplane anyway but I'm --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- really afraid now.
L:  Yeah, very hesitant.  And I always enjoyed [NOISE] flying and I have to say right now if someone handed me a ticket [NOISE] I just don't know if I'd hop on it real quick. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah --
L:  'Cause I have always enjoyed it.  I've taken a few trips by plane and I do --
R:  The --
L:  I enjoyed it.  It was a quick, easy way. [NOISE] You know, you didn't waste much time. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But this really squelched things for America. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, this [NOISE] --
R:  Well, you know --
L:  Our [NOISE] freedoms are kind of [NOISE] not easy any more.  They're not free. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's not, Dora.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's really not.
L:  It's, um --
R:  You know, hon, because, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] You just, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You just never know.  You go to the --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- grocery store; there might be -- you know, I'm even scared --
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  -- to go to the store because you don't --
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  -- know if there's --
L:  Where are you from then?
R:  Uh, Dallas, Texas.
L:  Okay, yes.
R:  And -- and, uh, where -- where at Nebraska do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you live?
L:  And we're east, uh, west of Omaha. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  West -- like a c- couple [NOISE] of hours -- about two and a half west [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH] Well, see we had --
L:  -- in a small community [NOISE] is where --
R:  Oh, well we had a plant -- a big plant.  Uh, uh, Lucid Technologies plant in Omaha and I think --
L:  Oh, uh --
R:  I think it's closed down too.
L:  I think you're right.  I think you're right.
R:  C- but, uh --
L:  And what do you think of that too?  There's a lot of our plants are being --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- closed and sent south and, um --
R:  You know what, Dora?  That's wrong.  You know, uh, [SIGH] they keep, uh, talking about, uh, the unemployment and the economy --
L:  Yes.
R:  But how do we get it better if they're sending --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everything out?
L:  And they -- trying to get, you know, cheaper help I'm sure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but that --
R:  Well --
L:  -- doesn't help us here, uh, to --
R:  No.
L:  -- keep our, uh, people here [NOISE] and the finances here.  We need our industries here.
R:  Well, not only that but -- as I say I was in manufacturing for about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thirty years but --
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  The -- the trouble is there's no --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- manufacturing any more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's all -- just like you said it's all gone overseas.
L:  Uh-huh, yes and I just --
R:  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But if you noticed the stuff you get from overseas is cheaply made.  It's not --
L:  Yes, not near -- not well --
R:  No, no.
L:  It falls apart, uh, basically [NOISE], you know.
R:  And -- and, you know, nowadays even when you buy a car that's overseas.  I've had 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I had a friend of mine that had a Toyota --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And when she went to have it fixed, well the part they didn't have in stock and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they said they didn't know when it'd --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- be in stock 'cause it comes --
L:  I see.
R:  -- from overseas.
L:  I see.
R:  But, um, you know --
L:  No, I don't know.
R:  There's -- there's not much we can do about it.  But, uh --
L:  No.
R:  Uh, you know, it's -- it's scary.
L:  [NOISE] I know, I --
R:  It really is.
L:  When my -- we came up here from Lincoln [NOISE] my husband worked for a place called [NOISE] National Crane.  It's in [NOISE] Waverley and they'd been there for [NOISE] -- oh, I suppose forty years and now they're closing the door [NOISE] and going south and it's gonna literally shut down the city of Waverley 'cause [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's who [NOISE], uh, lives --
R:  Ha- --
L:  -- there and they have their grocery stores there. [NOISE]
R:  And that's -- that's how they make their --
L:  And the rest of --
R:  -- living a lot of 'em.
L:  And that's how they survi- -- you know, that's how the town survived.  Well, now we've [NOISE] figured it'll be a ghost town. [NOISE]
R:  Well, you know, uh, I don't know if you still have Kmarts up there but our Kmarts all closed here in Texas.
L:  No, and we're all closed [NOISE] now.
R:  Oh, did you all close too?
L:  Yes, we [NOISE] -- very few are around.
R:  Well, see we've -- we -- every one of ours is closed and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Kmart's been around since --
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] What --
L:  Forever.
R:  -- fifty, sixty years?
L:  They're kind of the beginning of all this --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- mega thing. [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and -- and I've had grocery stores -- major chains that matter of fact there has been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two grocery stores in the last three months close.  My drug store where I have my prescriptions filled is closing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they've been there forever and, uh, Kmarts is all closed.  It's like a ghost town.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's u- -- it's unreal, but, uh, [SIGH] you know, how do you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put people to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work --
L:  Yeah, they don't --
R:  -- when everything is folding like that?
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I really don't know.
R:  And, you know, you can just draw your unemployment for so long.
L:  Mhm.  And that's -- this is it.  I [NOISE] know my husband; he works [NOISE] in a manufacturing plant here in town [NOISE] and, um, [NOISE] it grew --
R:  So, he --
L:  -- out of a [NOISE] basement of a home [NOISE] and it was great [NOISE].  Well, eventually they sold it. [NOISE] Well, now of course the guys are still trying to work there but it got sold [NOISE] and of course now it's very shaky [NOISE] 'cause of -- it was a shame it had to be [NOISE] sold out.  And, um, [NOISE] you know --
R:  Well, you kn- --
L:  -- one minute they have so much work to do they don't know what to do and the next minute they've got nothing.  So, then [NOISE], like you say we lay off and then the morale goes down. [NOISE]
R:  Well, you know, I know it --
L:  And your spirit is just not there any more. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know it.  Before our plant closed it was, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It was, you know, it was -- it was horrible.  The morale of the people was --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- down.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and the company was scared because they were afraid you were gonna sabotage stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, it was just a -- it was a real horrible situation.  And nowadays you're afraid you're gonna use your healthcare, you know.
L:  Well, that's it; our benefits. [NOISE]
R:  Oh -- oh -- oh, I know it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  See, m-, uh, my insurance, you know, like we were paying like a co pay of ten dollars when we went to the doctor and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two months ago it went up to twenty dollars a --
L:  Yes.
R:  A- and then prescriptions has --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- went from ten dollars co pay to thirty.  So, [SIGH] --
L:  Right, it went to thirty and now we've -- we've tripled it here with -- I h- -- I'm taking a medication and I've got to the pay the [NOISE] -- like a hundred and thirty one to go with the medications.
R:  What kind of medication are --
L:  It's Avonex, uh, [NOISE] for MS. [NOISE]
R:  Well, s- see, uh, I'm taking a -- a high cholesterol medicine, Probacall[?] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  and they just called me this morning; they're gonna add another one to it 'cause my cholesterol is still high.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They added another to my blood pressure medicine --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- and -- and -- oh, I know it, hon.  It's just unreal --
L:  Yeah, it's -- it is a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nightmare.
R:  And I told 'em -- I told 'em this morning. [NOISE] I said --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I said, "I don't know where it's gonna end".  And he said, "Well, come by and I'll give you a bunch of samples".
L:  Right, right.  And that's --
R:  And [NOISE] --
L:  -- good that they help us that way.
R:  Yeah, the doctors --
L:  A little bit.
R:  -- wanna help you.  They don't know, uh, uh, you know, but every little bit helps.
L:  Sure it does, yeah.
R:  But I've heard that, um, if you have a -- I don't know if you have a Costco near you?  C.O.S.T. --
L:  No, we don't.
R:  C.O.  They're like a Sam's.
L:  Oh, I see.  No, we don't. [NOISE]
R:  We've got one or two down here.
L:  Oh.
R:  If they ever put it in up there and they're going in all around --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, get your prescriptions there.  They say you don't have to be a member to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- use --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- the, uh, pharmacy but you can --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- get 'em real cheap.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And a lot of --
L:  Okay, we'll have to keep that in mind.  I'll write that down.
R:  And a lot of people are -- are, uh, sending for 'em in Canada.
L:  Well, for goodness sakes. 
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  I guess I knew that too though the Canadian --
R:  Uh, you can get --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, you can get it real cheap there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, you know, it's just scary because I think, "Good lord, where does it all end?"
L:  Yes, that's -- that's the thing --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- what everybody wonders.  You know, when is [LAUGH] -- what's gonna happen?
R:  Um, I -- I -- know it --
L:  How's it gonna turn around?
R:  But, um, you know, I -- I always listen to the stock station, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- stocks and today they're way down.  Friday they were doing pretty good.  They're way down today so we're not making any headway.  I've lost so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- much in my stocks it's --
L:  Oh, yes, yeah.
R:  It's unreal.
L:  Oh, that's same with my husband.
R:  Did you say your husband's in manufacturing?
L:  Yes, uh-huh. [NOISE] They make --
R:  Then he knows.
L:  Yeah, we -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in that too and you just don't even wanna get that little piece of paper 'cause it's [LAUGH] --
R:  I --
L:  -- not gonna be good news. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, is his -- is his place going down?  Are they laying off and everything?
L:  They had and now they're busy now.  Uh, through the month of May they thought[?] they would be busy but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now we don't know at all [NOISE] what happens after that.
R:  Well, see it's just -- it's just, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, uh, week by week you take it any more.
L:  Yes, that's right.
