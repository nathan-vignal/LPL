R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Debbie Moffett.  Who is this?
L:  My name is Anne Janette Klinder[?].
R:  Did you also sign up for interviewing people?
L:  I did.  
R:  Okay, so it sounds like we interview each other then. [LAUGH] 
L:  It is very interesting.  I had no idea how this even works.
R:  Okay, um --
L:  So the topic is, um, how we --
R:  How we get --
L:  -- get our information. 
R:  Yes. 
L:  And I get mine, I guess, on the T.V. 
R:  And just because the call has to be, I think, eight minuets long --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we -- I'll ask things specific or you can ask me.  I don't have --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- television reception where I live in the country.  
L:  You don't?
R:  So, would you say that you have, you know, fifty channels or thirty channels --
L:  No, we only have -- we don't -- we don't get cable, so the only channels that we receive are -- I think we have maybe thirteen.
R:  Okay, so you have --
L:  And so --
R:  -- a fair selection, but not because of cable.
L:  Yeah, not very much, so it's mostly, um, like, in the evenings when I catch the -- the news, um, it's mostly news that's on most of the channels.
R:  Okay.  And do you purposely listen for news?
L:  I try to.  Lately I haven't.  I have a son that's sick right now and I feel disconnected with what's going on if I don't catch it, 'cause I don't listen to the radio. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And what about newspaper?
L:  Yeah, we don't -- we don't do the newspaper.  We used to, but we just found that we didn't have enough time to read it.  
R:  Okay.  And how much, I guess it said, do you get news from other people?
L:  Other people?  [LIPSMACK] Not quite so much, 'cause I -- I stay at home.  We don't have a lot of, ah -- I don't have a lot of people that I see day to day so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's definitely just whatever I catch on the T.V. 
R:  Okay.  Do you have a husband or spouse that comes --
L:  I --
R:  -- home and brings you --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- news?
L:  -- I do.  And he -- he's very connected with his job and when he comes home we -- if the T.V. is on and we're watching the news, we'll discuss it.  But we really don't -- he doesn't bring up a lot of comments, unless it's something that we see right away. 
R:  Okay.  Now you can ask me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, do you listen to ra- -- how do you get all your news?
R:  Um, actually we're in Canada in a fairly -- it's not that isolated, but I guess it's a little more isolated, because some of the services aren't available.
L:  Really?
R:  So, because we're thirty five miles from the nearest town, which does have cable vision, we -- we cannot get cable.
L:  Oh.
R:  Unless we wanna pay for the satellite. 
L:  Right. 
R:  Which is about fifty dollars monthly. 
L:  Wow.
R:  So for me, our news, things like the war things, like the trade towers, some of that could have went by for several days before we would have been aware --  
L:  Really?
R:  -- these major things were happening, so that --
L:  So how --
R:  -- one of the reasons --
L:  -- did you find out?
R:  Okay, well, the trade towers just happened that -- I don't think they gave us this choice, but on computer when you look at, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- your hotmail --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they do have a news box that you can pull up so it -- that very day of the trade towers had something about, you know, this -- these fires and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- the planes hitting.  So that one was so unusual, so I did read the --
L:  Headlines.
R:  -- the computer news.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, normally I wouldn't, you know, go into the computer for the news. 
L:  Really?
R:  And then, of course --
L:  Do you get -- do you get the radio where you're at?
R:  Yeah, but, um [LIPSMACK] I guess it's something I never grew up having on, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not a habit.  So it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- isn't something that I put on for background noise or any other reason. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Newspapers are in town, but I guess, um, it's a kind of town that's, I think, eighteen thousand people, you wouldn't purposely wanna buy their newspaper --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so I'm not inclined to buy the newspaper from Vancouver, which is the bigger city.
L:  Wow. 
R:  But I did grow up in Ottawa which was a bigger city, so then of course our family always had a newspaper.
L:  So do you feel disconnected with what's going on outside of the wo- -- in the rest of the world, or ...?
R:  Um, I think when something important happens --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then you feel bad you didn't know about it.  But my father in law and -- and mother in law do live four kilometers further down the road from us --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they do have the satellite T.V. so if we visit we would get news at that -- those times.
L:  Wow. 
R:  But generally we've found that the news is so negative that --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- it's better to have missed it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Sometimes it's really nice to miss it, 'cause then you can focus on your own life.  
R:  Yes.  So, we, yeah, we -- also I'm a Christian so I don't live in fear of -- of events because I know there's a lot of events that are going to happen. 
L:  Right. 
R:  And are -- are predicted to happen and that there will be wars and so these things are not -- I don't need to know about them for sake of trying to protect myself, I guess. 
L:  Right.
R:  I already have knowledge --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these things will happen. 
L:  Wow.
R:  Expect them, pray for the people, but don't -- don't, you know, feel like --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- you have to be part of it, I guess. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  I -- I -- and guess my children have been in -- raised without really a -- a knowledge of -- of being up to date on the news.  So that -- they may be unusual husbands then --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, 'cause, they wouldn't maybe come home and look for a paper --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- to read and anyway, they haven't learnt habits, let's put it that way.  They haven't learnt habits that maybe are good habits, I don't know, but th- they're not anyway trained to look for papers or look for the news at six o'clock. 
L:  Right. 
R:  So that might make them more involved with their families as they --
L:  I -- I would think so.
R:  Yep.
L:  Wow. 
R:  So [inaudible] --
L:  Hav- have you done a lot of these phone calls?
R:  [inaudible] one.  Is this your first one?
L:  Yes. 
R:  Yeah, so I'm thinking, I thought they gave us a choice on the topic and there wouldn't be another person on. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Be- because it said something like if you didn't like the topic you can always hang up.
L:  Right.
R:  But if there's a real person on, it doesn't seem right to hang up on the call, does it? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I suggest that it just doesn't connect.  So, how did you find out about the phone calls?  'Cause that would be a news topic, like --
R:  Okay, um, I was looking for a home business --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I started one, called Meluka[?].  Have you ever heard of that company?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Okay, should probably get your [inaudible] when you talk about Meluka anyway, it's, um, was one thing I wanted to check out.  You know, what -- what can you do from home to earn money?  And then, um, I went to, I think it's called Mums Working at Home or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- dot com.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it -- if you sign in and pay thirty seven dollars, there's a new part of that site that's called, um, Money and Surveys.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, therefore, when I signed in for this, paid the fee, then they send you all these choices and the Fisher Study was one of them.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, just something you could do at home.  It's not, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, gonna make you wads [LAUGH] or anything. 
L:  Right.
R:  But basically there's companies out there that need people to do surveys.
L:  Right.
R:  So if you take a few minutes of your time, they usually will reward you somehow or other.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  So that's how I heard of it.
L:  Huh.
R:  So I sa- -- I guess, ah, they didn't ask, but the computer is a lot of an information source for me.
L:  Oh, yeah, see, I'm surprised that they didn't -- they didn't give that as an option, the computer.
R:  No.  And then how did you hear of the Fisher Study?
L:  Um, I ha- -- I'm on a group on the, um, internet and one of the ladies, ah, posted it.  She actually -- actually I do get a lot of my information of what's going on from this group. 
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Um, and this -- this one lady in particular, she's very up to date on every little thing that's happening.
R:  So you're calling this a co-op group or something?
L:  It's not a co-op --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- group, it's like a, um, [LIPSMACK] um, a support group.  
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so you -- do you know these people originally or they could be all over the country?
L:  Nope, they're, um -- it seems like there's not many people where I live.  There's two in the same state as me, but most of them are all over the United States that I know of.  There's some people in Italy and Israel.
R:  Wow.
L:  And some other groups, yeah, but it's interesting co- -- because und- -- in different parts of the U.S. everybody gets different information about the same event.
R:  Huh.
L:  And you -- I never thought about that before but e- -- it's always reported in a different way.
R:  Are you talking about the news?
L:  [inaudible] in the news in general, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  So they'll hear a story --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'll hear it a different way than them.
R:  Through your group, now are you referring to?
L:  No, like, on -- on the news.  
R:  Okay.
L:  It'll be reported differently here than it is in other places.
R:  So, is that what prompted you to join this group?
L:  Um, no, no, my -- the group that I'm on in the internet, it's for mothers that have had -- that had to pump breast milk.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  And so it's really helpful to have a lot of other knowledge about how to do that.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, but they're very up to date on everything that has anything to do with being a mom.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So ...
R:  So, okay, so you weren't looking for a job or any other thing, it just --
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  -- they mentioned that this study needed helpers and --
L:  Correct.
R:  Okay.
L:  Correct.  Yeah, they're -- there's all kinds of different, ah, people from every range of, um, family background or career background or whatever. 
R:  Okay. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, hopefully this helps their study even to he- -- see that the computer is a wonderful [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.  That's what --
R:  -- way of --
L:  -- they really should say.
R:  -- keeping in touch with people. 
L:  I think -- I think the computer is ju- -- does more for us than anything else.  The T.V. is more secondary I would say.  
R:  Okay. 
L:  Yeah, how [inaudible] is that?  It's supposed to be ten minutes, right?
R:  Yeah, we're -- we're getting out about ten minutes.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  But, um, what did they say was going to happen --
L:  They ju- --
R:  -- there was something about an -- answer a question or something like that.
L:  Yeah, I di- -- I didn't -- all I remember them saying is that they would let us know when the time is up.
R:  Okay, so the time mustn't be up then.
L:  Yeah.  That's interesting.  So --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  I don't know.  [PAUSE] Um, so you --
