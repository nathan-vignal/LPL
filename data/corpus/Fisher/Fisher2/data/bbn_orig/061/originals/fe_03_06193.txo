L:  Hi, my name is Sylvia.
R:  Hi, my name is Carol.
L:  Hi, um, [SIGH] I've never done this before.
R:  Me either, this is my first time too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess, uh, the topic of conversation is --
R:  Is --
L:  -- supposed to be hobbies.
R:  Hobbies, uh-huh.
L:  Um, I'm a twenty three year old, uh, furniture design student so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, [SIGH] most of my hobbies either have to do with, um, art or, um, design, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I like going to, uh, museums, in particular, um, contemporary art museums.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I like, uh, sketching I guess, uh, usually I like [LAUGH] doing sketching that doesn't have anything to do with, um, my field.  So, um, in my spare time I like, um, [LIPSMACK] doing little cartoons and such.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, what are your hobbies?
R:  That's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sort of interesting.  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, I'm an older person, uh, my children are all grown and, um, I like to do hobbies like crocheting and making afghans.  Um, I also like to do couponing and refunding, that's one of my big hobbies right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I like to save money using coupons.  Uh, recently a couple of stores in our area started doubling coupons so if you took a fifty cent coupon in there you end up getting a dollar back.
L:  Yeah, that's always great.
R:  So that was really nice.  The last two weeks two different stores started doing that, so I'm very excited about that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I've, uh, recently one of my hobbies is, uh, getting on the Internet and learning --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things about that and I've joined a chat group on there about couponing and refunding.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, we like, help each other and swap coupons and things over the Internet, which sounds kind of -- kinda weird but, you know, people used to do it in their living rooms and now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we're doing it over the Internet, so that -- that's one of my hobbies.  And I like to sew.  I like to make, uh, clothing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I like to do different arts and crafts.  Uh, I don't do too much of that anymore, I used to do more when I -- my children were small, so I [inaudible] --
L:  What kinds of arts and crafts did you like to do?
R:  Um, just -- just about anything like, uh, making -- making pictures.  Like, cutting pictures out of magazines and making different collages.  Um, [MN] you know, just things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes the kids would come home and need a project for school, you know, so we'd start digging and try to figure out what we could do to make up something for that or they would, uh, enter into the, uh -- uh, a science fair, so maybe it would be something scientific.
L:  That's nice.
R:  We'd try to, you know, work something out and, um, build something or make something and, uh -- but mostly I liked, uh, crocheting, which I do in the cooler months --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh -- and then there's -- there's couponing and then I like to send the -- the rebates in to get money back.  So that's -- that's one of my big hobbies right now.  Oh, and I like to read.  I read a lot.
L:  What kinda books do you like to read?
R:  Um, I like, um, romance novels --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the Regency period, when they go back into England and talk about the old days and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, how things were then, how things were done.  Um, how the kings and the queens lived at that time.  I think that's much more interesting than trying to study world history and I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I learn a lot more.
L:  I was about to say, my, uh, my boyfriend is, um, a comparative literature --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- student at U. Penn.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, pretty much that's all he either gets to read or [MN] that's pretty much all the books that are in our house, are either, um, comparative literature books --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or like, world history, to go and check the facts from those books.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, yeah, it's --
R:  Well, it's really, really interesting how -- I think, how far women have progressed.
L:  Right.
R:  From those days, and -- and you can find that out by reading some of these books 'cause the people that -- that write 'em, you know, um, they don't only write the love stories, I mean, they have to get the facts, they have to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- get the history behind writing it, and that -- that's the part, sometimes, that I think is more interesting than the other because they -- the different, um, classes of societies that they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- had, um, the type of clothing that they wore and things like that, just like, you know, if you were watching a movie that was based on that time period, you know, so --
L:  Can I ask you a question?  Did you happen --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to see Manor House at all on PBS?
R:  Uh, no, I don't think so.
L:  Well, it was all about, um, class differences and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, gender roles and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh -- I don't know, I'm sure that's probably getting a little bit off the topic but, um --
R:  Probably.
L:  -- it was [LAUGH] --
R:  But I -- I like things like that, I like -- you know, I like to watch old movies for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for that.  And read books and -- and I think I learn a lot more than -- than I would if I had to sit down and -- and remember that in nine- -- in eighteen forty two something happened, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you had to try and memorize it.  I mean, that's important in it's -- in it's own field but -- but I feel like now I'm learning more about that when I read a book like that.
L:  Right.
R:  I feel like I get, you know, enjoyment, plus I learn something.  And -- and, um, I think it helps me a lot because sometimes like, if I watch a program --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's asking questions like, um, [LIPSMACK] the millionaire pro- -- that -- I forget what it is.  Who Wants to Win a Million --
L:  Yeah, Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
R:  Yeah, Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  That program, uh, Jeopardy or, um, some of the other programs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know a lot of the answers and my husband's like, "How do you know that?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Because I read".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when you read you -- you -- you -- you pick that up whether you realize it or not, it's stored in the back of your mind.  For a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  For a while.  And -- and then you may retrieve it later at a, you know, when the opportune time comes, so ...  Um --
L:  Do y- -- do you think everybody needs a hobby?
R:  Now you -- do you like to do things?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  What?
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes?
L:  I'm sorry, I'm just getting a little bit of feedback on the phone now.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, do you think everybody needs a hobby or ...?
R:  Yes, I think you need something to do besides go to work every day or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- take care of your children every day.  I think you need it for relaxation, um, just to, you know, get your mind in another mindset, something that you can enjoy and get and -- and give -- either give enjoyment to other people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or receive enjoyment yourself in what you're doing and, um, a lot of times both, you can give and receive because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whoever, you know -- whoever you're doing this hobby and you give something to somebody, like when I crochet I would just crochet afghans and -- and no -- no particular pattern, just whatever yarn I have I make up my own pattern as I go, as far the color and how many rows of this color and that color.  And then when something happens that, uh, somebody new moves in or whatever, then I'll give them an afghan or --
L:  That's nice.
R:  -- if somebody's sick or in the hospital well then I'll give them an afghan.  And so, you know, hopefully they get some enjoyment out of that and I had enjoyment.  I -- I like to always do two things at once.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, like [LAUGH] if I'm watching TV I like to be crocheting or, um, you know, sometimes if we're driving in the car I like to be reading, so I incorporate my hobbies into other things, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um --
L:  I -- I usually feel, um, like when my life gets a little bit too busy for me to spend time on my hobbies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I feel like I go a little stir crazy.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, sometimes you get very busy and you don't have time for that but, uh, you know, it's always something you can go back to when -- when you do have time, or sometimes you realize, "Hey, I haven't done that in a while and I need to -- I really need to make time for that" so that -- so that you can get a break from your everyday life, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think hobbies are important and -- and I think it's important for children too, to have hobbies, not only adults, because if you're trying to make something or you're -- you're learning to do something -- I was teaching --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my granddaughter to sew when I was visiting her, and she got a big kick out of that because we made like, a little, um, quilt --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of big squares, you know, for her doll.  And so she was very pleased and was showing everybody, you know -- Gra- Grandma did a lot of it, you know, and she did some of it too but, I mean, it's a learning experience and that's how they learn.
L:  Yeah, it's a good way to pass things along.  I used to do that with.
R:  Somebody has to teach them and, um, you know, they can't teach you everything in school and, um, even though you're teaching somebody it's still a hobby.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, they can, uh, they can keep that with them for a long time.  [inaudible] uh --
L:  Yeah, that's -- it's good to pass that down.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I did --
R:  My grandmother taught me to crochet and I'm still -- still doing it, so, you know, it's -- it's something that can carry on and be handed down, so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think it is important.  Um, what type of, uh, furniture do you design?
L:  Um, modern furniture.  My favorite, um, is probably Danish or +Swiss furniture.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  From the nineteen fifties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I guess a lot of the times, uh, I don't like the way the furniture is sometimes really cheap and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- put together on a -- an assembly line.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that's something that, um, has really been lost.  I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, putting in a lot of time for detailing and making quality pieces that can be passed down.
R:  And sturdy.
L:  Um -- yeah.
R:  Good pieces that are going to last, to be passed down.
L:  Yeah.  There's -- I think there's nothing worse than spending, you know, a good chunk of money on something that you're only going to have for a year or two.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, my mother used to own an antique shop --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so in my spare time --
R:  So you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what's good and what isn't good.
L:  Yeah.  We would go, um, antiquing, which I guess now that she doesn't own her store, it's still her favorite hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so we would go thrift store shopping, we'd go, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, oh, what's the word?  Um, auction!
R:  Mhm.
L:  We'd go to auctions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, just spend a lot of time doing that.
R:  Even garage sales you can find some things sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  So that's another thing I really like to do.
R:  Or estate sales.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, that's a hobby too.  I like to do that too.  My husband and I like to go every Saturday if we don't have something planned.  For about two hours in the morning --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and just see what kind of little goodies we can get, you know, that's where I find a lotta my yarn for my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for my crocheting hobby.  A lotta people will, um, you know, maybe their wife passed away or something, they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't have any use for it so they'll just put it in the garage sale, so I get
