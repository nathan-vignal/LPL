L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Christine.
R:  Hi, Christine, my name is Barb.
L:  Hi.  How are ya?
R:  I'm incredible, how are you?
L:  Pretty good.  [MN]
R:  How do you get your current events?
L:  Hm.  How do I get my current events?  Um, mostly the news.  Someti- it depends on where I am, sometimes I read the newspaper.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But mostly the news, sometime- --
R:  Do you travel?  Is that why you -- you say it depends on where you are?
L:  Um, yeah, I'm -- I'm a -- I -- I live in upstate New York and I go to New York City a lot.
R:  Oh I see, okay.
L:  And I only read the paper in New York City. [LAUGH]
R:  I see.  So when you travel are you traveling in your car or ...?
L:  Um, depends.
R:  Oh.
L:  Sometimes I drive down, sometimes I drive part of the way and take the train the rest of the way.
R:  Okay.
L:  Sometimes I car pool with somebody else who's going from here to there.
R:  So when you drive you don't have the radio on, you don't ever really listen to the news through the radio then, it's either TV --
L:  You know what, that didn't even cross my mind.  I listen to talk radio all the time.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, if you listen to talk radio you're probably getting the slanted current events --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- then, aren't you?  But you're getting them. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, they're very slanted.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Very.
R:  Oh geez.
L:  But I really enjoy it.  Sometimes I'm like, trying to get outta my car and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just sit there and --
R:  Gotta hear that next caller, huh?
L:  E- exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Who's your favorite --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk show person?
L:  I've been listening to, [SIGH] what is it?  Bill O'Reilly and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- somebody Lynch.
R:  Okay.  Well, you would love the news the way I get it then, especially if you like yours that way.  Um, I get my news, um, from my pocket PC because I also am a very active female, uh, although I work from my home, I still do it that way, I, uh, get my news from, uh, audible dot com.  And what that does is it downloads The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and, uh, the, uh, then I can also get the talk shows, I can get the Bill O'Reilly show, I can get a lot of those others and they're read to me through my pocket PC, so I listen to them audible, on audible [inaudible] --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- as I'm traveling, um, so I get -- I mean, I s- -- I also read the newspapers and things but I don't have time to read The Wall Street Journal but I can get it through audible dot com.  It's -- it's a service that I pay twenty nine dollars a month for but that gives me six audible books a month and every newspaper or magazine, talk show that I could dream of, I mean, like Ruth's, uh -- Ruth's, um, sex advice [LAUGH] or -- you know, or +Lake -- Lake Willbegone[?], any of those guys, whatever I want, talk radio, um, national, public radio, any of those and --
L:  Unlimited?
R:  -- so in the morning I just put my pocket PC in its little cradle and I shake my -- what I need to do for the day while I'm in my shower and meanwhile it'll download all of those and put it in, and then -- and whether I'm driving or whether I'm riding or whether I'm doing whatever, I can just put the headphones in.  If I'm by myself I put it up on my dash and put the -- a cassette adaptor in the car, uh, radio --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then just put the little earphone, put that jack into the earphone jack and it blasts through the whole car, if I'm by myself.  Or if I'm with someone else, I can just turn on the pocket PC and put my headphone -- headsets in and m- -- well, actually I got little earphones that go in that are real comfortable.  And I get it -- I get it that way.  So I have the news and the unbiased news.  And you can select from The Wall Street Journal, for example, I'm in -- being a nurse I'm gonna listen to the health more than I wanna listen to say, uh, financial news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I'll get like, the world and the US and then I'll go through and select, you know, not really -- unless it's like, tournament time I don't care about the sports, I'll, you know, axe that and go right to the health news or the science news, or if the war's going on I want that.  So I can be selective as to what parts of the news sector would I normally read and that's what I want them to read to me. [LIPSMACK]
L:  What -- so how does it sound?
R:  Oh, it's wonderful.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Audible books are extremely clear, um, and I have of course my favorite readers but the people who read this, they're really -- and what's so great about it, the way the, uh, Wall Street Journal and The New York Times is indexed on the audible books as if they start talking about, um, a particular article it'll -- they'll read you -- first of all they read you like, the whole paragraph that's, uh, like the little teaser you would get in the news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They read you that.  If I have no interest in that then I just skip and it goes to the next article.  So I don't have to fast forward and hope I'm in the right spot, I can just push the button right then and I know that I'm going to the next article.  If I don't want that one I'll go to the next one.  And some mornings I'm just in that kinda mood, I don't wanna hear [LAUGH] -- I don't want to know that Jay Leno broke a bone or [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you --
L:  right.
R:  So I can pick, um, so I can get the entertainment news and -- and I can skip, just as -- as I would skip through the paper, I can skip through it on audible.  I love audible dot com.  It has helped my son [LIPSMACK], he's a senior in high school, we just got back from his valedictorian ceremony, and he has a four point oh, but he has just a barely average IQ not a real high IQ, but I have used audible books with him for all the classics.  Right now he's reading Nineteen Eighty Four and Brave New World but he doesn't read, he listens.  And that way he can, you know, play it -- he gets the benefit of both worlds.  It's [inaudible] Bradshaw who are actually reading 'em to him so if he wants to sat down and follow along the book he can.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  But usually he turns it on at night and plays it for a couple of hours and if he falls asleep no big deal, backs it up in the morning and listens to it again.  And I've done that with him.  He taught -- he's -- he's learned Spanish and French both those wa- -- that way.
L:  Really?
R:  It's a great -- it's a great, I don't know, to me it's wonderful because I can get my local news [LIPSMACK] on the radio, I can get my local news from the newspaper but if I want -- I -- I like t- knowing what's going on in the world and of course with you, New York -- New York pa- newspaper probably is your local newspaper [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So that makes it great for you but I do read The Wall Street Journal -- well, I don't read, I listen to The Wall Street Journal --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and The New York Times every day and I'm in rural Kentucky.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  I'm in, uh, Louisville, Kentucky which is -- I'm actually south of Louisville --
L:  I used to live there.
R:  -- I'm a little -- pardon?
L:  When I -- I lived there when I was a kid.
R:  Oh did you really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I live in Brookes, are you familiar with Brookes?
L:  I don't remember anything --
R:  It's just -- okay --
L:  I was only four.,
R:  -- it's just south of Louisville, it's a real little country town just south of Louisville.  My dad was just -- you know, my dad's the county sheriff, I mean, it's your little county, it's a little -- it's just a small town.  But we have all the big city advantages of having the sixteenth largest city right -- just right up the turnpike.  Um --
L:  It's Louisville?
R:  Louisville's the sixteenth largest city.
L:  Is it really?
R:  Yes it is.
L:  Wow, I didn't know [inaudible].
R:  You'll have to come home sometime! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But we have drive by shootings, you know, we have all the same things that --
L:  Oh yay!
R:  -- you guys have in New York.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, you know, we don't get left out.
L:  All the good stuff.
R:  Yeah, we have all the good stuff, we've had our first case of SARS and, you know, we've had all -- we have all the good stuff that the big cities have, we just have it, thank God, in smaller quantities.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, uh, uh, so therefore, you know, I am in -- uh, because of what I do, because of what I enjoy, uh, I wanna know what's going on in the world as well as what's going on in Louisville.  Our local newspaper comes out twice a week and by the time it comes out I usually know everything that's gonna be in that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's no fun.  So, what do you do for a living?
L:  I teach.  I'm an English teacher.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Great.  Well, there you go, see that's another reason why we do -- I was an English teacher and then I went back to school and got my degree in nursing because, uh, the bad thing about teaching English is they, uh, they allowed me to have time off and every three months I would develop another expensive habit.  I became a scuba diver, I became a private pilot and I couldn't afford that on a teacher's salary.  My son will be majoring in musical education [LIPSMACK] following in his mother's footsteps! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh God! [MN]
R:  But I keep telling him, "You will be hungry but you will make a difference in the world and that's, you know, that's what it is all about".  He is really looking forward to it.
L:  I enjoy it.
R:  He loves -- you know, he wishes that he could be an English teacher.  He keeps saying, "Mom, I'll never make it without you" but with the Internet he'll do fine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My oldest son had, uh, oh, horrible English grades and he would send home these essays he had to write, he was in a private college in Arizona and he would send home these horrible essays and, oh, he had maybe seventy five, a hundred words, he goes, "Mom, this has got to be two fifty and I need it now". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh God!
R:  But this is the child that everything is black and white.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That is a door.  That is not a white lacquered, six foot, you know, uh, he just cannot elaborate on anything, so [SIGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  So both my boys have -- they've grown up and as a matter of fact my son won a scholarship by stating that, uh, at our house he has to have proper grammar, proper English and he cannot allow his participles to dangle and when he is at his father's he has to respond to things like, "Gee, et[?], what'd ya have?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he talk- -- he talked about the difference in the vernacular, the re- red neck vernacular versus, "Mom will just like, not feed you" if you c- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you come up a step with a dangling participle.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and so -- but he didn't go to -- he won a, uh, governor's scholarship with the essay.  But he said -- and I said, "Why did you write that?"  He said, "Well, Mom, it's true".  I said, "But that's gonna get published and your dad's feelings gonna be got hurt" and he goes, "Well, you know, so be it".
L:  Wow.
R:  He said, "It's just the way it is".  He said, uh, you know, he said, "It -- it's not so bad now but when --" he said, "When I was three years old" he said, "You should've seen how hard it was to cope". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  It's like two different languages.
R:  Oh it wa- -- well, he actually said, he said it was like we'd go to his dad's and it would be like speaking a foreign language.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, because he's been -- and well, he's always been with me so he would -- the rare times that he would go see his dad or his dad's relatives he said, you know, he said, "And my dad would --" he said, "I -- I remember what you told me about him always saying you were talking down to him" so he said, "I was trying not to talk down to him" but he said, "Mom, it's hard to when everything's a three syllable word".  And he said, "Forget playing scrabble", that was [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's family feud for [LAUGH] his dad's house. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible].
R:  'Cause my son can just kick butt, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  The current events are, um, well, I -- I guess I'm fortunate 'cause my husband now, so he reads the newspaper [LIPSMACK] every day.  He's now retired but before he goes down to stairs to his basement home office he reads the newspaper, front to back, and, uh, it's always just been a big thing for both of us, so ...  I figured when that topic came up that, oh, well, I'll probably get somebody who says, "Oh, I don't read the paper and I don't like listening to the news". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Never watch the news.
R:  'Cause it's boring they're gonna -- they're gonna do what they want.  But it's like with my son now, I -- I get disappointed when they don't bring in current events and, uh, in his classes, and I'm forever trying to stimulate him.  I -- I bought him the Iraqi cards.  I ordered those as soon as they came out 'cause I wanted the kids -- I knew a lot of families wouldn't have that experience.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I t- -- I sent them in to his AP US government class and now he came home tonight and he said, "Mom, everybody loves these.  The teacher had heard of 'em but she hadn't seen 'em and she used them for all class- -- all of her classes all day long.  She g- -- I just got 'em back", he said, "To look at 'em".  He said, "I wanted to keep these for my kids and for my classes in later years" and he said, "They're manhandled!"  I said, "That's okay, honey, I'll order two sets of 'em, you can have 'em --"
L:  I've seen 'em on Ebay.
R:  Yeah.  You can have it -- well, I just actually ordered them for like, four ninety five, and got them.  It took forever.  It took about twelve weeks to get them.
L:  Wow.
R:  But they were like four dollars and ninety five
