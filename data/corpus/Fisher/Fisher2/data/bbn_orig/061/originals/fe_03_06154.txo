L:  [NOISE]  Hey, I'm Joanna.  [NOISE]  I'm in Somerville.  [SIGH]  What's up?  [MN]
R:  Hi, Joanna, t- this is Stephanie in Kansas City.
L:  [NOISE]  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  Um, so we have to talk about current events --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- today or how we get our --
L:  Or how we get them --
R:  -- information.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you want to go ahead and start?  [SIGH]
L:  Sure.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Um ...  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, I watch the news [NOISE] [SIGH] and I get them every time I check my emails because I have a news service pop up when I ... check my personal account.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really?  What --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- type of news service is it.  Is it through like --
L:  It's through Yahoo.
R:  -- CNN or ...?  [SIGH]  Oh, Yahoo does it?  [SIGH]
L:  Yes, [NOISE] you can, ah, program [NOISE] your -- your page to show [NOISE] ... the latest headlines.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, m- most of the time -- well, I have [SIGH] somewhat free -- most of the time I spend on the computer at -- at work [SIGH] and so in between [SIGH] calls or whatever that I have to take [SIGH] I usually, ah, browse CNN for the latest headlines, or go out to Yahoo or whatever.  But [SIGH] CNN seems to be [SIGH] you know, the most [SIGH] you know, comprehensive listing of -- of events.  Or if I'm looking for --
L:  Oh, I'm sure.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- something [SIGH] specific --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if CNN doesn't have enough I'll go out to some of the other news web sites [SIGH] and --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- go out and look for that same topic.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But [SIGH] other than that I mean [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the Internet seems to be the way to go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but my husband and I are both hooked on, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, headline news and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- CNN --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and whatever on the TV --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean lately that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- b- basically it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't even know why I pay for [SIGH] cable or any other additional channels because [LAUGH] --
L:  That's the only one you watch?  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I mean, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- we'll go to bed with headline, we'll get up with headline news or [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whatever it is.  So, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I have to say I -- I really like [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the, um, the constant feed at the bottom of the screen.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  So, even if you're not interested in what they're talking about, you can still [NOISE] --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- check out stuff.
R:  Now you said you're in S- Springfield?
L:  Ah, Somerville.  [SIGH]
R:  Somerville, and where is that?
L:  [NOISE]  Massachussetts.  [NOISE]  It's Boston.
R:  Massachussetts, oh, okay.  So, it's near Boston.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, do you guys have pretty good, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, l- local news?  Do they provide [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yes, ... excellent.  [MN]
R:  Excellent.
L:  You know, it starts at five, [NOISE] ... it ends at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] six thirty and then you get the national news and then [SIGH] it starts again at ten and [NOISE] [SIGH] ... ends at eleven thirty.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that's pretty much ours too and then if there's anything big going on [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah, they're right on it.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, they tend to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just go ahead and k- -- like, everyone complains a lot of times, especially since we've had tornados lately but they're, ah, trying --
L:  Oh, right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- to keep everybody.  [SIGH]  They've been trying to keep everybody, you know, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Okay, this is what's going on.  This is what's happening in this neighborhood."
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "This is what happened in this neighborhood" and then, [SIGH] you know, every time w- we have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he- heavy storms or whatever they break in [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to, you know, w- whatever programs people are watching.  So, I know, like, a couple of weeks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ago everybody got real upset because it went [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in over Friends and [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody's Thursday night shows that they watch.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, but [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- our local [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is the same way.  They -- they really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] you know, trying to keep everybody informed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the time.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, well I can imagine.  [NOISE]  Are you Kansas City, Kansas or Kansas City Missouri?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Um, Kansas City --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- Missouri but, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, most people don't know that it's r- right ... in the middle.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's on the border ... between, --
L:  [NOISE]  O- o- oh!
R:  -- ah, the s- state of Kansas and the state of Missouri.  [SIGH]  So, actually I could drive --
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that would make sense then.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH]  Right.  I could drive [SIGH] five miles west and I'm in Kansas City, Kansas.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]  A good friend of mine's actually in Colombia right now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- visiting her mother.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  That's kind of in the center of the state --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kinda [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess the midwest of Missouri.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  But, um, [MN] yeah, that's -- a lot of people are like, "Oh, you're in Kan- ..." ah, e- everybody assumes that Kansas City is in Kansas but, um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it's -- ah, just along the border --
L:  [NOISE]  Wow.
R:  -- [SIGH] of both states.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's a -- it's really a pretty large metropolitan area --
L:  [NOISE]  I'm sure.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] we have a lot of suburbs and whatever so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess that's probably --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- why [SIGH] our news is so good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I mean, even [SIGH] when we had the tornados our --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- news c- covered it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even when it went into Colombia [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Jefferson City and some of the places further east, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't know, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if people are picking up the news from Kansas City --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or if they're picking it up from St Louis or --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you know, they want to make sure that everybody's [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well informed I guess.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that's a good thing, though.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  [NOISE]  You need that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  E- e- exactly, it is.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's -- it's very nice to have.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Ha- have the tornados affected you?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um, actually it wasn't too bad.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It came [NOISE] f- fairly close, like, about a mile --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [SIGH] from w- where I live [SIGH] but --
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  -- it -- it was kind of scary.  We went and got --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- into the storm shelters and whatever.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And luckily, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, our [NOISE] news has the co- -- the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doppler radar on t- the Internet.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yep.  [SIGH]
R:  And so my husband actually went out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- s- storm chasing and I was telling him --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Okay, you go north on twenty nine highway and you go up here" and da, da, da, da, da, --
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and then when I start --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when the sirens went off ... I w- wasn't so worried yet, because I knew where they were.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  And then when we started to get hail then I l- left.  Then I went to the storm shelter.
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  I was like, "Okay, no more computer".  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  So, [SIGH] yeah, like our -- our, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] local pool hall [SIGH] got hit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where we --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like sports bar type place where --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- if -- if there's a game on and the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- r- regular s- stations --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aren't covering it [SIGH] we go down there and they got hit.
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  So, that place was, like, d- destroyed but [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I haven't actually seen any of the really, really heavy damage.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Most of it's all been ... TV or whatever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] 'cause they don't want anybody down there that doesn't belong down there --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Well, I can imagine.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- because of l- looters and so on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so forth.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Oh, my!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]  So, how did you hear about the Fisher project?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Craig's List.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  Out of -- out of -- do you have Craig's List out where you are?
R:  No, I don't  Uh-uh.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Craig's List is an Internet [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- b- basically, a posting site that --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- started in San Francisco.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um, and now they have [NOISE] ... little satellite ones in different cities and there's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one in Boston and it's really great for things, [NOISE] like, if you're trying to find an apartment [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] people can post s- stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for free.  And [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, that's nice.  [SIGH]
L:  -- or, like, if you're trying to, [NOISE] you know, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sell your skis [NOISE] or something.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Or, I mean, you can find jobs there.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There's lists of, like, community events and things like that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  That's just w- within one [NOISE] of the general community boxes.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Well, we actually have, um --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] there's a web site that I go on --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- for l- like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] savings and coupons is the wa- -- the way --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- it started.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But actually what happens --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's sort of like that where [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's nationwide.  Everybody gets on and they're like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [SIGH] "You know what, --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- there's this special going on at Kmart [NOISE] --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- [SIGH] and if you use this --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- coupon that came out of this --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you know, Sunday's paper --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- [SIGH] you can get [SIGH] --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you know, really cheap toothpaste" or --
L:  [NOISE]  Cool!  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, but r- really I go in there and look for stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like they had -- T- Target had Teflon [SIGH] pans on sale --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] their brand of Teflon, but it is Teflon.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they had 'em on clean ups for, like, seventy five --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- percent off so I bought, like, all these --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my God!  Teflon?  [SIGH]
R:  -- Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, I got, like, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- six and seven pans for under ... fifty dollars.
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  So, I go on the site all the time [SIGH] and check for, like, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- all these really great bargains.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Gosh!  [SIGH]
R:  And so they --you know, they post things on like how to work from home or --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] how to make money and not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really work.  So, they're were, like, [SIGH] "Oh, sign up --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- for the Fisher Project --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you know [SIGH] they pay ten dollars p- per call or whatever --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- and you talk for ten minutes" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and da, da, da, da, da.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, actually --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- two people that are on the site actually got to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk to each other [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE]  That's funny.  [SIGH]
R:  -- so it was really funny.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They were like, "Oh, I don't believe I got to talk to you --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- that's neat", da, da, da.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!
R:  So, ... [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  That's really funny how they work that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, [MN] it's interesting.  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, you never know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  One time I got on here and nobody was on here so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was like, "Um, I don't know if I'm supposed to keep talking? --"
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- o- or is somebody [LAUGH] going to jump --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- Hello, --"
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  " [SIGH] -- is anybody there?"  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Ah, w- whoops!  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Oh, well, okay, bye".  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, yeah, it's --
L:  [NOISE]  Probably not so helpful to the p- [LAUGH] project.  [SIGH]
R:  No, probably not.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, it's an interesting thing.  So, Boston's a nice area?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, I love it.  I grew up just north of the city and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, that's good.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I went to school here.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  My family's from here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- although they moved --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um, [SIGH] [NOISE] yeah, i- it's very ni- -- you know, you get seasons which I enjoy.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yes.  I come from Florida so --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That's where my parents just moved to.  [LAUGH]
R:  Did they?  Oh, there are no seasons there but hot.
L:  [SIGH]  None!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  It's just hot.  I went, --
L:  [NOISE]  Hotter and hotter.
R:  -- actually, I went in January and it was actually c- cold [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah!
R:  -- and I couldn't believe it but ... you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ever since then it's always hot and I love it here in the midwest and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody, "Can't believe you like that snow stuff" la, la, la --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] but it's gorgeous [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  It is but it's --
R:  -- every -- [SIGH] it's -- all of it.
L:  [NOISE]  It is but it's -- it can be a pain in the butt too.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I mean, I'm sure you guys get clobbered --
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  -- just as bad as we do.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, yeah.  We --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] have our days.  [SIGH]  But it ha- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, lately it hasn't been so bad and -- and when I used to work --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from home for my -- ah, you know, for --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- my company [SIGH] it was great --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I could just say, "Oh, well, I guess I'm working from home today?" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know we had the option.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  And now I don't have the option any more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I have to go into --
L:  [NOISE]  So, you have to trudge out --
R:  -- the office
L:  -- in that s- snow.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Ick!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Exactly.  [NOISE]  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  I'm --
R:  Oh, well.  [NOISE]
L:  -- lucky enough that I have public transportation nearby.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, well that's nice.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, Somerville is, [SIGH] [NOISE] ah, you could say it's a suburb but it's kind of [NOISE] -- it's pretty urban.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  It's just sort of like a -- [SIGH] it's almost just like a borough of [LAUGH] Boston.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  So, we've got the T and the buses and stuff running right by our house --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- which is nice.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  We have one -- I mean right up.  I live in an apartment complex --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so if you go -- ah, I-- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it would take a bit to walk there [SIGH] but they do have the public --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- transportation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I drive [SIGH] like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thirty miles south to go to work.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Oh!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  So, I don't how many mus- -- how many buses I would have to g- get off and on --
L:  R- right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to get to work and I'm like --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- "Oh, well, sorry!"
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  I'm hoping to -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- maybe one of these days somebody's going to volunteer --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- to carpool so that people up here in this --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- part of town will, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, be able to carpool or something.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Wow!  Kansas City's that big?  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Wow!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  See, where I work it's called Overland Park --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it's really like you said --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- like an u- urban [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- area that's --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- part of Kansas City --
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] metropolitan area.  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Well, it's like Somerville and Boston.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Although my office is technically two -- two miles [LAUGH] door to door.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, well that's nice.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  It's just over the line in Cambridge.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, I mean --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I drive most times because it's faster.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
