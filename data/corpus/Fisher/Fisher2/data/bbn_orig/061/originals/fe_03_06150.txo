L:  Hi, my name is Mary.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hi, I'm Jan.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, Jan, nice to meet you.
R:  [SIGH]  You too.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I guess our topic is current events, [SIGH] huh?
R:  Current events, yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  You can go first if you like.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I guess mainly I keep up with current events through, ah, television and, um, Internet.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, with me it's -- I guess it's primarily television.  When I go on the Internet I'm kind of there to have fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And I -- u- usually on the home page where they have the -- all the news stories, I pretty much pass that up and just ... go on to do what I'm there to do.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, 'cause I feel like I get a lot of news, um, [LIPSMACK] both, you know, deliberately --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- sitting down to watch the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the news and [SIGH] just incidentally.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, when I'm cooking dinner or, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, in the kitchen I've got it on in the background.
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  So, I've kind of reached my saturation point by the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I get to the computer.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I guess, um, when I'm at work I'm in front of a computer, so [SIGH] it's pretty easy for me to [SIGH] just click on CNN --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or MSN and just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- read the headlines for the day, [SIGH] see what's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- going on.  [SIGH]
L:  How do you compare, um, the news that you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- see on the computer to [SIGH] what you hear on TV.  I mean I really haven't ... glanced at it enough to see, you know, what the style is.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, --
L:  You know, how it's different when you see news in the newspaper versus TV well, how is it on the Internet?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Some -- isn't it -- it's actually very similar to the TV because ... I'll usually link on to a TV station, like CNN or Fox News, [SIGH] or even -- or if I click on to the New York Times [SIGH] or the Washington Post --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- then it's very similar to ... t- the newspaper.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  So, [SIGH] it's a matter of what you're looking at on the Internet.  Either [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  'Cause it seems like, um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they e- expand a lot more on things on the Internet.  They kind of --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- break it down into, --
R:  It's true.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, it's lowest common denominator whereas on the n- -- you know, TV you're just kind of getting a -- a brief little --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- sound byte about certain things.
R:  Sound byte.  [SIGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Whereas it's more expanded on in the Internet.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  And I also find on the Internet I might ... limit myself [SIGH] because I'm l- looking for a specific thing.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Whereas [SIGH] TV even those little sound +bytes -- bytes you get [SIGH] a little bit here a little bit there.  [SIGH]  Ev- everything.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  So, ...
L:  -- find -- to be honest with you I, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [SIGH] I try to stay away from the news these days because it just seems like, you know, --
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- th- there's been a lot of, you know, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- b- bad, n- negative things on.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, my husband and I w- we're kind of semiretired right now --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and so we spend a little bit more time at home [SIGH] and we kind of try and make a point of, [SIGH] you know, finding out the +latest updates on things and then turn it off because otherwise --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- l- like I say it's just a constant, [SIGH] you know, flow of information.  Unfortunately, it's not always good.  [LAUGH]
R:  There's a lot of stuff too on TV just t- trying to scare us right now which [LAUGH] -- I -- I mean 'cause they're all trying to compete with each other.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I t- think sometimes they go overboard with what they're reporting.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [SIGH]  I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You mean -- are you talking about like Laci Petersen?  I -- I know you're talking about terrorism at first [SIGH] but, um --
R:  [SIGH]  A- all of that.  All of that, you know?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, like -- like this Laci Petersen thing, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --it's -- it's, um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- obviously very sad but it's [SIGH] -- it's just -- you know, it's like, are we going to  be seeing this for the next two years?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  You know, they just d- dissect it --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and [SIGH] -- and talk about every l- little detail.  And --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- sometimes when there's nothing to report [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  -- they just basically rehash --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the same old [SIGH] report and try and make it look likes it's news, when it's not.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Just keep it in front of the public, --
R:  [NOISE]  Yes, --
L:  -- day after day.  [SIGH]
R:  -- I agree.  I agree.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I -- I completely understand [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- turning it o- off [LAUGH] after --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, um, --
L:  I wish there were, um, [LIPSMACK] like a -- a good news channel [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- like, you know, a channel that you could turn on t- to get like human interest stories.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that wasn't completely [SIGH] -- actually, s- sometimes PVS if they have [SIGH] sor- -- not -- not necessarily news but [SIGH] sometimes they have current events shows.  And I find that they're pretty --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] -- they don't really take sides --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- as much as some of the others.  [SIGH]
L:  You know, I would l- like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to listen to PVS more.  Um, we used to n- not have satellite, we had just antennas [SIGH] and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I would listen to it because it was one of the only channels we got.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  And that was years ago.  And t- then we got -- m- moved into an area where we could get satellite.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And, so now ... we don't get PVS on satellite --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- because if you get it on antenna, they won't let you have it on satellite.  [SIGH]  So, I have to, like, switch it over to antenna.  And I find that for the most part we watch satellite when we do watch TV.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I haven't watched PVS in years.  Um --
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I imagine they would have [MN] really --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- worthwhile programs.
R:  They -- yeah, they usually do [SIGH] and they're not as biased as some of the other [SIGH] -- or they're not out to --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] s- scare you as much as, say, Fox [LAUGH] N- News is.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's very dramatic --
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- a lot of -- some very theatrical --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and staged and it's -- it's almost tabloidish.
R:  Yes, it is.  I agree.
L:  A l- little bit, you know.
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, and some of the other channels are guilty of it too [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- depending on which one you w- watch.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But, you're right there's [SIGH] -- there's hardly any that are, um, [LIPSMACK] neutral, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, they might claim to be, --
R:  -- that are just there for the news.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, fair and balanced.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  Fox is fair and balanced, please, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know,  [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come on.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  And some of the other ones might l- lead you to believe that they're not biased one way but, I mean, you can pretty much tell what the bias is.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, definitely.  [SIGH]
L:  So, [SIGH] -- [MN] what is your, um, status in life -- are you -- ah, do you work during the day?  It sounds like you do?
R:  Yes, I do.  Yeah, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I work, too.
L:  Spend a lot of your time at the computer?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, I'm actually an environmental consultant so I -- I'm out ... doors [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about half the week and then the other half of the week I'm [SIGH] indoors report writing.  So, yeah, it's easy for me to just click on [LAUGH] CNN --
L:  So, you're like --
R:  -- just to take a break or [SIGH] --
L:  -- you visit clients all day?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do, um, field work outside sampling and stuff.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  So, do you listen to the news when y- you're in the car?  You spend a --
R:  [SIGH]  You know, that's another -- that's actually another avenue that I do get my news.  A lot of times I will [SIGH] listen to the news in the car since I am in the car a lot.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  I've -- used to every day put on --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um, AM radio --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and listen to the news until the war started.  [SIGH]  And then I found myself [LAUGH] listening to music more --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- just because I c- couldn't --
L:  Yo- --
R:  couldn't listen to that all day.  [SIGH]
L:  -- you can only take --
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- so much of that.  I mean it just seems [SIGH] I don't know, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- kind of almost disrespectful in a way to ... h- have ... war.  [SIGH]  I mean over here it's almost like an entertainment thing you know, --
R:  [NOISE]  It is.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it --
R:  That's very right.  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  -- really, it's like some sort of --
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- video arcade game or something.  And [SIGH] over there it's very real.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And -- and the business of having embedded reporters, I don't know, I thought that kind of got a little out of hand.  [NOISE]
R:  It did.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, and just [SIGH] -- a- as they say I think they got, -- um, the war got the highest ratings [SIGH] --
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- over all the other ... television programs, --
R:  I know.
L:  -- for a time.
R:  I know.
L:  So, I guess they were playing to an audience.  [NOISE]  I guess that's what people wanted to see --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- but it's like [SIGH] enough already.  [LAUGH]
R:  Enough is enough.  And [SIGH] so ... and then I kind of got out of the habit of listening to that.  [LAUGH]  So, lately I've just been listening to the radio in the car.  But [SIGH] ...
L:  I used to when I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- ah, commuted.  I commuted for, um -- oh, gosh, about an hour and a half for five years.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And other than listening to books on tape I would get in the habit of listening to, um, talk shows.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  I was like a --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- talk show junkie.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I would listen to 'em all.  I used to listen to Tom -- I don't know if you're familiar with Tom Lycos?
R:  Oh, yes I am.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Tom Lycos and, oh gosh, Michael Savage.  He's the other end of the --
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- spectrum.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And ... just everybody I could get my hands on.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And ... I really enjoyed that.  I mean that's kind of a way to get your news --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] in a little different format.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  You know, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- and h- have people calling in giving --
R:  Calling in so you got --
L:  -- and giving their opinion.
R:  -- even if, um, the reporter is biased you still are getting both sides --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the [SIGH] -- although sometimes I think that they only put --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the stupid callers from the other [LAUGH] side on.  But --
L:  Yes.  Do you -- do you feel that way too?
R:  Yeah, it's like, "Okay, we're Republican --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- [SIGH] so any Democrat that's dumb we'll put on --"
L:  Yeah, e- exactly.
R:  "But if not, well we won't" [LAUGH] you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Or somebody they can just take pot shots at and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just really make look ridiculous.  That's --
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  -- my husband and I have said the same thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's -- it's real easy to see their bias because --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's -- you just find that they will make --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- fools out of the other side.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, whatever the other side maybe.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  So, yeah, [SIGH] very ... t- transparent isn't it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, [LAUGH] it is.
L:  Not fooling anybody?
R:  No, I guess [LAUGH] not.  But [SIGH] --
L:  Well, how long have you been doing Fisher?  [SIGH]
R:  E- excuse me?
L:  [SIGH]  How long have you been doing the, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] research --
R:  Y- you know --
L:  -- for Fisher?
R:  -- this is my third call.  [SIGH]  Um, I probably started about three weeks ago and I -- I f- forgot about it.  I had two right -- right in a row.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  And then this one -- is at least a week later.  So, I forgot ... about it -- th- that I was even doing this.  [LAUGH]  And then --
L:  Yeah, me too.  I --
R:  -- I was surprised when the p- phone rang.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I had a couple and, ah, --
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I actually had one that I completed and then one that I almost completed and the lady had to go.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh no!  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I figure I've got one more coming.  And so I finally called them the other day and I said, "Hey, I never got a third".  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  And some how or another they had my account messed up and they reinstated it [MN] and said I could expect, you know, that I may -- they -- they may even start me over and give me three calls, [SIGH] you know, --
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  -- like I was starting over.
R:  Oh!
L:  So, I don't know -- this is the s- second time I was contacted.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  The other day, I forget what it was, it was some topic that I felt I knew nothing about so I didn't take the call.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I h- had that with, um, [LIPSMACK] something about sports and, you know, I ... had a little bit to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk about 'cause my [SIGH] -- my --
L:  Oh, you know what -- I think that was it.  I think it was [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sports.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That's good.
L:  [SIGH]  And I thought, "There's going to be a lot of long pauses if I'm on --"
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- the other end of a conversation about sports.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  The other girl on the line was just like, [SIGH] "I know nothing about sports and I don't have a TV".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was like, "Oh, okay".  [LAUGH]
L:  Boy, there's not very many people who can say they don't have a TV.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I was just like, "Oh! [LAUGH] --"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- you don't have a lot to talk about".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  So, [SIGH] that was --
L:  -- usually --
R:  -- very hard.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I've seen people that have TVs that they don't turn on --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- which is probably a good thing.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  But I don't know too many people that don't have one.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah, it's pretty hard to know what's going on if you don't have a TV.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, [LAUGH] d- definitely.  So, ...
L:  So, ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Anyhow --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- probably get another one tonight.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  It seems like the phones have, ah, ... d- definitely had more activity on this lately.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I've had two or three calls.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I'm surprised -- I was surprised when that, ah, week went --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I thought about it and then I just kind of forgot and [SIGH] but, um, --
L:  And you know you can call too.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You can actually call their toll free number.
R:  Oh, every -- every time I've ever tried it's been busy.  [MN]  And so ...
L:  Oh, what times are you trying?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [SIGH] --
L:  Usually at the end of the day?  [SIGH]
R:  I've tried it -- like around four o'clock.  [SIGH]  Five o'clock --
L:  [SIGH]  Huh!
R:  -- and they've been busy.  So, ...
