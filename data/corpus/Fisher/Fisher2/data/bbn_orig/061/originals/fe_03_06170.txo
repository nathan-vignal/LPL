L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, this --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- is Doreen and I'm from Michigan. [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  Mary Jane, I'm from Florida.
L:  Oh.  Hi, Mary Jane.
R:  Hi. [SIGH]
L:  Um, okay.  So, where do I [MN] get my news from?  I -- I mostly read the newspaper.
R:  Oh okay.  I -- actually I get mine mostly online but that wasn't even one of the options.
L:  No, i- it wasn't, and --
R:  So I would -- of the options I probably get more from the radio 'cause I am not a big TV person.
L:  Right.  Well, and TES and radio too.  I do -- I listen to talk shows on the radio and -- and, um, uh, there's one on mostly in the afternoon, a Christian talk show, and things like that.  I -- I typically don't watch the news on TV.
R:  It tends to be a little on the slanted side.
L:  Slanted and -- and it's all -- it -- it just [SIGH] -- it's just all bad news.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, and the other thing is the -- the kids absorb so much of it.
L:  Right. [NOISE]  Right.
R:  I mean, mine are three, six and nine and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they're very in tune, especially in today's, uh, current events.  They're very in tune to that and, you know, when you have a six year old come up to you and say, "Mommy, are the bad men gonna stop doing the bad things that they're doing now?" you know, it's like [SIGH], you know, you've --
L:  Right.  And mine are little too, I have a, um, my youngest will be six on Wednesday and then I have two seven year olds and a eight year old.  So, yeah, I don't like them watching the news.
R:  And I use, um, Netscape as far as my -- my email.
L:  Okay.
R:  And when I go to the home page it's basically --
L:  That's what I use too. [SIGH]
R:  It's a news page.
L:  Yeah, and that's -- it's exactly what I use too. [LAUGH]
R:  And [MN] I rarely pull it up without clicking on one of the news items --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's on there, to get more details about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... that's probably where I would say I get, you know, the majority of mine.
L:  I --
R:  So w- --
L:  Yeah, I got turned off by the news too.  You know what made me -- it makes me mad is all [NOISE] -- they -- they keep blasting these ads, you know, during the show, "Coming up, coming up at eleven or at six, da da da" you know, and they give you a, you know, and then, uh, you watch and you're waiting for this big old story and they devote less than like, a minute.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] You know --
R:  After hyping it.
L:  And -- and plus you were thinking you were gonna get like, this really cool story.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  A- and it's like, "What were all those fifty ads that they just played?  I don't get it".
R:  Well, and the thing is, when the -- when the news show is ticking down or [NOISE] and -- and not necessarily a -- a news per se show but like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- I can't even think of -- of w- -- my husband watches them or it's on when I'm fixing dinner, you know, he's like, "It's the news".  I'm like, "No, it's not, it's --" [SIGH] [SIGH] they try to -- they try to tout themselves as a news show but it's -- it's not like Sixty Minutes or anything like that but, um, uh, Entertainment Tonight --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- is probably one of the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- better ones but there are some others that are like, even worse, that always, you know, they've always tried to got -- to get, you know, some porn star that's doing something or [SIGH] the newest swimsuit, you know --
L:  And it's nothing but gas up.
R:  Yeah.  And they try to spice it up a lot and stuff.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it's kinda funny 'cause, you know, I- I'll usually know what my husband's tuning in for [LAUGH] and as -- as the time's ticking down I'm thinking, "Hm, I know that story he's waiting for hasn't come up yet, I wonder what the deal is?" [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well they -- they -- they purposely put it at the end to make you kinda --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- watch the whole thing.
R:  Well yeah, exactly, you have to watch in order to --
L:  You know, 'cause you don't wanna miss the show, the -- the part that they've done, you know, prodding you about.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And -- and usually it's not even worth it.
R:  Well of course, but I mean [SIGH] -- well, and I wonder whether it's not worth it because they hype it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so much that you're disappointed, or --
L:  Uh, perhaps.  At least with me perhaps. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, 'cause, I mean, if you keep hearing about something and hearing about something then you're expecting it to be really great, you know, and if it's not, I mean, it's kinda like matrix, you know, and if it's not that good then ... you know, you're disappointed.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Especially after --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all of the, you know, "It's coming up, coming up" you know.  'Cause every time they cut to a commercial, you know, it's like, "And coming up after the break" you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But it's not, it's coming up after several breaks. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  And I -- well, I like the newspaper or on the Internet because y- you can pick and choose --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] what you wanna -- like, if -- if there's an article you could spend two hours reading the article or two minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or not read it at all.
R:  Or if, you know, if it -- if it starts to lose your -- starts to lose your attention or realizes it's not what you were interested in or thought it was, you know, you have the option of just switching to something --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- else and -- and not wasting your time, where if you're sitting at the TV you are -- you're captive --
L:  Yeah, you're less likely --
R:  -- until they choose to give you the story that you want.
L:  Yeah.  And you're less likely to turn the channel than you are to flip the page.
R:  Well yeah, because you -- you know that when you turn back you're, you know, nine times out of ten of course you're gonna have missed the one thing that you were looking -- waiting for.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  See, we only get the -- the newspaper on like, a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday deal.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  And I really don't even, um, get the chance to open it Thursday and Friday, my husband usually takes it to work with him and, uh, you know, but Saturday and Sunday I enjoy, you know, grabbing it before the kids get up and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But during the week it's definitely, you know, like, an Internet thing but that wasn't one of the options. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I, uh, yeah, or like you say, the radio too, you know, is [NOISE] -- just they don't seem to like, do that as much on the [MN] radio, like --
R:  Well, on the radio it -- it has to be little snippets.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they have to pretty much condense it, cut to the facts, pick out the important facts.  See, they're not trying to fill a thirty minute or a sixty minute TV broadcast.
L:  Yeah, it's usually just the news like, on the hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for ten minutes --
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  -- or something.
R:  -- you know, like a -- a thirty or a sixty minute news show has to fill up that time every day, so they end up making news instead of just reporting the news.
L:  I think they do too.
R:  Well they do.  I mean, our -- our area has like, these, you know, fact finder and indepth and, you know, when somebody gets ripped off they go out and try and reclaim their money for 'em and they're making the news.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I mean, they -- they can't manage to fill up that time slot.  They can't sell advertising if they can't fill up the time slot, you know?
L:  True.
R:  So -- so they have to.  And ours always do, um, like, medical, uh, segments and stuff.
L:  Right.  That's what ours does too but --
R:  And -- and it's just --
L:  -- I -- I think it's pretty similar, you know, [inaudible] --
R:  It's just to make sure that they fill up enough of the time, you know, they've stretched out what would've have been an okay thirty minute show to an hour, you know, so that they can, you know, fill up the time without having to pay networks or, you know, even to run reruns and stuff.  So they're trying to fill up that time on their own and sell the advertising and make the money but yet they're -- doing that they've ended up, you know, creating all of these things that aren't really news, 'cause they're creating 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's just kind of ironic.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, I will tune in sometimes just for the weather, just to know how to dress the kids for school.
R:  Oh.  See, in Florida we don't need that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  My parents used to live, um, in, um, Tavares.
R:  I have no idea where that is.
L:  Which is near, um, it's near Eustis and Oakalla[?].
R:  Oh okay.
L:  That area of Florida.  About a -- about an hour north of Orlando.
R:  Yeah.  See, we don't even really use the weather channel down here very much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which, you know, I --
L:  You don't need to worry about it! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh w- well, I know.  Well, I -- I went to school in Hawaii and there you really -- they didn't even have the weather channel, you know, like as one of the options on the cable packages.
L:  It's just always nice! [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it is.  And if it gets above seventy there's always the trade winds so you -- you never even have to think about what the weather's like. [LIPSMACK]  So, but he- -- I mean, Florida's nowhere near that, I mean, it gets really hot and stuff but it's not like a -- the only time we have our program -- we don't even have like, the weather channel programmed in, even though we get it, we have it on one of the skip keys.
L:  Okay, unless there's --
R:  But like, if a hurricane starts coming up --
L:  I was just gonna say, "During hurricane season --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- you might wanna watch the news --"
R:  Well, I --
L:  "-- occasionally".
R:  Actually, that's coming up here pretty soon.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hurricane season starts like, June -- June first I think.
L:  Well there it could come in handy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Watching the news.  But you c- -- you would hear that, it -- it would be on --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- Netscape.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It would be on the Internet.  If there --
R:  Oh and the radio would constantly keep you updated and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even if you just happened to have the TV on, you know, they -- they would run the little things at the bottom, like if the kids --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- were watching Nickelodeon or something they would have the little things running at the bottom --
L:  Exactly --
R:  -- to update you --
L:  -- so it's not like you need to watch the news for -- even for that.
R:  -- on the location and stuff.  Yeah.
L:  Because, yeah, you're gon- -- you're gonna find out about it, you're gonna go to the store and everybody'd be talking about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- is this your, um, first call --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for -- oh okay, this is my second.
R:  I -- I -- well, I agreed to take one the other day and it was time travel and then, you know, they -- they gave me the -- "If you could go back in time and change one thing what would it be?"  And I was just like, "Oh!"  But then something happened and I couldn't hear the person on the other end.
L:  Oh.
R:  It sounded all muffled and
