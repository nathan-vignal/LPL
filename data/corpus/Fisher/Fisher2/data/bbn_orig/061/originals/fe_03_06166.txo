R:  Hi, this is Alabama.
L:  Hi, this is Tammy.
R:  [NOISE] And where are you from?
L:  In Ohio.
R:  Hi, Ohio, I'm Alabama.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, how are you?
R:  [COUGH] I'm doing just fine.  How do you get your daily topics --
L:  Well --
R:  -- f- from the TV and the Internet?
L:  Well, they -- I know they o- -- they didn't even offer the Internet but I get --
R:  I know.
L:  -- m- I -- I would say I get most of mine from the Internet and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- maybe a little miscellaneous stuff off of TV and the radio but the n- newspaper is -- to me is like where you get your coupons on Sunday and that's it! [LAUGH]
R:  Thank you, me too.
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that's -- that's where I get mine from, from the Internet and maybe from people I know too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but I don't trust people's, uh, interpretations --
L:  Oh yeah, when I h- --
R:  -- that much.
L:  When I hear something from people I know, I go look it up on the Internet.
R:  Thank you, me too. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You have to verify.  It's just like, uh, today I met a man that was in, uh, New York when the Twin Towers fell --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he -- he works through FEMA, uh, you know, Federal Emergency Management --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Association.  And, uh, he was out here looking at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my house because, um, last week we had a major flood and -- and the, uh, sewer system --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was just hit -- totally overloaded and it completely [NOISE] went through my house.  I mean, we've been tearing up carpet the morning coming. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]  So, uh, anyway, he was up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there doing the nine one one situation.  Um, and believe it or not we didn't talk too much about that, I just told him, I said, "I- it's something that I could not comprehend". [NOISE]  Which I can't.
L:  No, that was very difficult.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I remember sitting watching The Today Show as that happened and watching that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whole thing unfold --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a state of disbelief I think.  It didn't seem real.
R:  [LIPSMACK] No it didn't.  I -- I know I seen it on TV [NOISE] [COUGH] the first [LIPSMACK], excuse me, when they first announced the first plane [NOISE] and I was getting ready to go to a doctor's appointment [NOISE] and [NOISE] I thought, "Oh my goodness, you know, what kind of an idiot would let something like that happen?" and, you know, thinking about, you know, someone had, you know, [NOISE] misguided a plane and then I, [MN] what, just a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it seemed like just a couple of minutes later a second one hit and then there's talking about the Pentagon, then there's talking about the, uh, people in Pennsylvania --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that took down a plane. [NOISE]  And, you know, you [MN] you're right, I -- I saw some of that in the Internet yes, but that I saw on television.
L:  Now that I watched on TV too.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And I didn't leave that TV screen until I realized --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that other plane is circling over Ohio, the one that eventually went down in -- in Pennsylvania.
R:  Pennsylvania, [NOISE] yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  It circled around Cleveland and I thought, "This could be my last day and if it is, I'm gonna go get my kids out of school and bring 'em back home".
R:  Yeah, there's a lotta people did some unusual things.
L:  So I went and grabbed my kids up outta school.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I don't remember if I went to my grandparents, probably did because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gut --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- reactions in our family.  Just all gather.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  And, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that one I watched on the news.  That was a biggie.  But my husband is still in Venezuela and the kids and I had to come back to the States because it wasn't safe down there anymore and, uh, I keep up with those current events definitely online every day.  I go into Google News --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I -- I actually like that.  I think I'm --
R:  Huh? [NOISE] 
L:  -- starting to like that a little more than CNN.
R:  Where are y'all going and who with? [NOISE]  Where? [NOISE]  If you -- do not go down there that [inaudible].  I'm sorry, my -- I have a thirteen year old that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and my brother just showed up.
L:  [SIGH] That's okay, I have a seventeen year old and a fifteen year old, a fourteen year old [LAUGH].
R:  I have a twenty and a thirteen, that's it.
L:  Oh.  And a ten year old soon to be eleven. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Mm. [NOISE]  They're wonderful but they are definitely a try.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Mine don't even hardl- -- mine aren't even allowed to step out of the yard [LAUGH] so ... [MN]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Um, well anyway, uh, getting back, I mean, I'm -- I've got, uh, sci fi on and you don't get anything such as news on there.  You know, I said, I just -- in the mornings and in the evenings I'll turn it on, that's -- that's the TV.
L:  Yeah.  In the mornings I'll watch The Today Show.  I'm -- I'm pretty loyal to NBC, I only get my news from there.  Not because of -- of any kind of credibility issue with anyone else but just because that's -- those are the people I prefer to have to deal with [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to have to watch and hear.  So ...
R:  I used to see, what's that one with the guy and the woman?  Regis.
L:  Oh.
R:  I have tuned into him.
L:  Do they -- do they talk about current events on that show?
R:  Uh, yeah, some of it.  Not -- not exactly like NBC or WBRC, which is local here, but yeah, some. [NOISE]  Uh, the NBC's a little bit too widespread for me personally, that's the reason why I put [NOISE] -- turn it on.  Usually the NBC ne- -- the, uh, shoot, CBS local news in the mornings, if I turn it on at all, and then late at night I'll turn it on for the late night news.
L:  I don't get a lot of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- morning local news because I usually don't turn on the TV that early.  We'd -- I'd have to watch it between six and seven to get any local news.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I usually -- if I'm up during that time and actually functioning as a human --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm probably reading email or something. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Hm.  I don't know how they expect you to keep this topic going for a long time! [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There's just -- there's not a -- they didn't give us a very broad topic to talk about.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I don't think I get much from the radio.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If I happen to be out driving around and listen to the radio and accidentally hear some news, that's about it.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.  Uh, I'm gonna switch gears just a minute.  Uh, h- how many of these phone calls have you taken? [NOISE]
L:  Um, I've missed a bunch of 'em, had on my answering machine and --
R:  Oh, that's me too.
L:  And I've taken, I don't know, I think this is just my second one.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, they say some are -- some people are actually being invited to take twenty or so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- calls.
L:  Well, I had no idea when I signed up.  I don't even know who I signed up to do this with, I can't information on it any --
R:  Uh, it's a university study. [NOISE]  It is a university study.
L:  [MN]
R:  Now, how do you get most of your information?  Through the Internet, that's how I signed up for mine.
L:  Well, me too.  And I think somebody on some bulletin board posted this thing like, "I'm doing this thing and --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- if you sign up use my code" and I thought, what the heck, I don't [MN] -- it can't hurt.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, that -- that was me too.  It's kind of [NOISE] -- kind of curious in a way.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But at the same time it's good. [NOISE]
L:  Well, I do -- I get my -- yeah, not just news news, like news stories but definitely my like, news like "Hm, where can I -- where can I find this or ..." to me that's news too. [LAUGH]  To me finding out just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I sweepstakes as a hobby.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So part of my daily news --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- is finding out who I know won something in sweepstakes that day.
R:  I used to go into the sweepstakes all the time myself, uh, uh, web -- web stakes dot com.
L:  Oh yeah, those have so many --
R:  And, uh, sweeps dot com.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So many people enter those online big ones like that --
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  -- that they're not as winnable.  But I have a -- a newsletter that I've been subscribing to for, I guess almost ten years on and off, when I'm in the country. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] I like it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And she has --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a bulletin board and stuff like that, so ...
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, to be honest with ya, I -- I was on a chat line when, uh, when the phone rang, or just had gotten off of because the computer -- I've got an older computer and it doesn't act, uh, doesn't act good. [SIGH]  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, I'm, uh, and my husband had just called since I turned on the computer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to tell me that he got an apartment.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, you know, I don't know what else to say, you know, so just, you know, this is kind of an odd time for me, so forgive me if I seem a little distracted.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Uh, we've been married, uh, over nine years and he was living with another woman for six months.
L:  [SIGH] You're kidding me!
R:  And he come back home for nearly two months. [NOISE]  And then I caught him still carrying on an affair with her.
L:  So you just got a big dose of news via telephone tonight, didn't you?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Well actually I called him over the weekend and -- and he come back prom- promising -- but -- but then she said she was probably pregnant and that he would never know if he was with me. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's not the lamest, oldest trick in the book.
R:  No. [NOISE]  No, I told her that too.  I said, "All you're doing is just egging it on".  So yeah, she said, "Well I don't want him.  I -- I'm not looking for a man, I -- I'm drawing the, uh, widow's benefits. [NOISE]  I'm not interested in marrying him.  I just want someone to play with when I get horny". [NOISE]  Pardon my language.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] yeah, so I get a lotta stuff on the Internet that -- but at the same time telephone sometimes is a big [NOISE] -- big play.  Current events though, I have to say, gonna be the Internet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or the, uh, t- the, uh, TV, but if it's the TV it's late night only. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, and I don't watch any late night news on TV.
R:  [NOISE] That's about the only time I can sit still usually.
L:  Well, [inaudible] --
R:  Or it used to be.
L:  With my husband overseas right now, that's like -- that's our time to communicate.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I get my news from him and we -- we are online together in the --
R:  Well --
L:  -- evenings.
R:  Now -- now that is great.  He -- he's in the services?
L:  No
