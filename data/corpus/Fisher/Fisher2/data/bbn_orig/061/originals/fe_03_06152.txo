L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hi, my name is Geena.  [NOISE]  I live in New York.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, I'm a -- [SIGH] a fellow New Yorker, I'm Norad[?].  I live in New York also.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, I live in Long Island.  Where do you live?
L:  Oh, Bronx -- Bronx, New York.
R:  Oh, awesome.
L:  Long Island, [SIGH] so we're neighbors.  [LAUGH]
R:  What?  [SIGH]
L:  We're neighbors.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  So, where do you get, ah, your news from?  [NOISE]
L:  Well, ... if I don't go up on the Internet, [NOISE] and -- and get it, basically, I watch the news --
R:  [NOISE]  Mm.
L:  -- and I read the paper.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's like me.  With me I -- I use, ah, News Travel[?] Long Island [SIGH] [NOISE] or I use, ah -- they've got the Discovery Channels and stuff on Iona.
L:  Yeah, that's real good.  I watch the Discovery Channel and C- -- I watch a lot of CNN.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, me too.  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, it's us.  [SIGH]  CNN gives you everything.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  They give you a lot but ... not enough, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, sometimes you have to get more on the Internet.  [SIGH]
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, sometimes you know, it's [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just either newspapers or Internet these days.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, but the news -- the newspapers are good too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  But, you know, certain newspapers too [NOISE] 'cause, like, for example I get the Daily News.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Um.  [NOISE]  [MN]  Well, I get the New York Times, News Day and stuff like that.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  I heard that News Day is good.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  The New York Times I finally got a [NOISE] -- [SIGH] a grasp of it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  With the New York Times you've got to just [SIGH] -- in order to read it you've got to, like, s- section it off.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]  There's so much of it.  [SIGH]
R:  I know I used to work for Seven Eleven and it's difficult putting those things together, [NOISE] you know.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  For real?
R:  Yeah, and then you have to be able to understand it in order to put it together, because you've got to know what sections go where.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Wow!
R:  It takes a while.
L:  No wonder you used to read it, you used to put them together.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's good.  [SIGH]  So, which channel do you watch for the news but -- like, I -- I know you watch CNN but like --
R:  [NOISE]  Um --
L:  -- you're local channels?
R:  Well, my local channels are Channel Twelve.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I got Fox News on Five.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, definitely Fox Five News.  [NOISE]
R:  And then you got, um --
L:  Do you watch Dave Price in the morning?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  No, actually, um, I like watching, ah, what's that show at five o'clock?  It's, um, USA Today.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] um, [MN] it's on at, like -- it starts at five o'clock and it ends at seven.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] what's the name of that station?  [SIGH]  I'll never remember it.  You know what [NOISE] it -- it -- um, [LIPSMACK] USA Today I think it's called, [SIGH] or something like that.  [MN]  But I think it's on like Channel Two.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Okay.  Okay, that's CBS.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, th- that's right.  [MN]  But, ah, yeah, that's -- that's a pretty good station.  [SIGH]  They pretty much tell you what's going on during the day and the events and stuff.
L:  [NOISE]  The, ah, [SIGH] and there's -- sometimes do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like when they -- like, when you're watching a program [SIGH] [NOISE] do you like the fact that they interrupt ... for a special report?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, I can't stand that.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  I'm not going to fret.  I don't like that either.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh!  [NOISE]
L:  Especially when you're watching a real good [NOISE] -- [SIGH] but then again, [SIGH] you'll be saying, [SIGH] "Okay, what's been happening?"  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, you definitely want to know, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you --
R:  Absolutely.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, what's going on.
R:  [SIGH]  I mean if it's a big thing I guess, you know, I don't --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, --
R:  --  mind [MN] --
L:  -- exactly.
R:  --much.
L:  You took the words right out of my mouth.  [NOISE]  That's true, [SIGH] --
R:  You know, but --
L:  -- 'cause if it's real [NOISE]-- like [NOISE] something real like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "Oh!" [SIGH] then I can understand.
R:  -- like -- like nine eleven, you know, that was -- that was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something different, [NOISE] you know.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Like that was -- like there's a fire in your hometown, that's something different.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, that's the whole thing.
R:  But then, I mean, if it's something s- stupid, you know, [SIGH] then -- then it -- then it gets ridiculous, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's really no -- you shouldn't need, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the interruptions.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That's true.
R:  You know, [SIGH] like you got your -- your daily programing.  [SIGH]  And, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, sometimes that ten -- you know, the ten o'clock news comes on [NOISE] [SIGH] and before ten o'clock they'll interrupt for ... a stupid, you know, a little +broadcast.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But I mean other than that, you know, some stations are pretty good on that though, [SIGH] you know, they'll really wait until ten o'clock.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  R- right.
R:  So, I guess it all depends.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, 'cause ah, -- I -- you watch the late news sometimes also?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, 'cause I usually catch, like, [NOISE] the ten o'clock news.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, sometimes I have -- I have to, you know.  Sometimes during work and stuff you can't [SIGH] just sit [SIGH] there and, ah -- and just, you know, watch the news or -- [NOISE] y- you can't even sit there and read a newspaper.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  So, ...  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah sometimes but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like with CNN I like -- I like them [NOISE] a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because they [NOISE] [MN] they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bring it to you.  [SIGH]
R:  Absolutely.  [NOISE]
L:  I like -- you know what I like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- seeing in a lot of times though, [SIGH] because I -- for example those people [NOISE] [SIGH] out in -- in tornado country and all of that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  I'd like, "Hell, give me the information [NOISE] on how those people are doing out there".  'Cause see we're over here in New York and [NOISE] [SIGH] with all the b- big buildings and skyscrapers and stuff.  [NOISE]  Thank God we're like safe from [NOISE] [SIGH] tornados but that -- that's flat land out there.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, a lot of the [NOISE] -- I -- that's -- that's what I really love about CNN that they [NOISE] [SIGH] bring you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- breaking news, especially --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with something like that.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, with CNN -- CNN's really good when you're taking [NOISE] trips or --you know, [SIGH] across the country because you really need to know [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] when you're going -- like, let's say I went to Vegas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in October --
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it was very important to me --
L:  [SIGH]  I went to Vegas.  [NOISE]
R:  -- to know [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] what was going on over there, if it was rain, storms or whatever.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Where did you say you went?
R:  Oh, my God, it was gorgeous!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Where you went?
R:  [SIGH]  I went to, ah, Las Vegas.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Las Vegas, that's what I thought you said 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I went to Vegas.  I won ten thousand dollars when I went to Vegas.  [SIGH]  It was a couple of years back but I can't wait to go again.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I went --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out there when, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] Tyson was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fighting Douglas.  It was a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] a number of years back but I'll never forget.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Man, if you've been to Vegas you have lived.  I l- love V- Vegas.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it was awesome.
L:  [NOISE]  Wasn't it awesome?
R:  It really was.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  And I- -- you know, it's amazing --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, they got the old part and then they got the new part.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I got stuck in the old part, actually.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  And I had to find a taxi out but [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  You know what when I have -- went out there it was so funny because I went shopping and everything [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and what was so funny about it is like before I got, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to the shopping mall I was like hauling a cab.  You can't haul no cab out there, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- like you do over here in New York.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  That's what I --
L:  You have to --
R:  -- expected to do.  [NOISE]
L:  -- call one wherever you at.  Like, if you're going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from like a mall to a restaurant or casino [SIGH] you have to call a cab unless you're gonna walk and --
R:  Yeah, and you know --
L:  -- it's not far.
R:  -- some companies actually hang up on you [SIGH]  [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're too busy at nighttime.  [SIGH]  I got stuck at a -- I -- I think it was like twelve thirty at night [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just wandering around, um, l- looking for a cab.  I found a Seven -- a local Seven Eleven and I stopped off and [SIGH] luckily a sev- -- you know, taxi cab driver came in and I was -- I had to wait for him to make his coffee and stuff.  [SIGH]
L:  Whoa!  [NOISE]
R:  I was like, "I need a ride back to a hotel".  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  He said, "Well, they should --"
L:  -- what hotel did you stay in?
R:  What?
L:  What hotel did you stay in?  I stayed at the Union Plaza.
R:  Tropicana.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I heard that.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Did you get it -- I know you went into the Mirage.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, my God it was awesome.
L:  [SIGH]  Were any of the white tigers there?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really!
L:  See that's another thing too, the Weather Channel --
R:  Oh!  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's a good source of information.  [SIGH]  I like to keep up with the weather because when you want to go and travel [SIGH] --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- they'll tell you exactly.
R:  Yeah, you know, I watched the Weather Channel before I went and they said it was like eighty degrees there.  We got there.  The whole time we were there it was like seventy degrees.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  It was so inaccurate.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I couldn't believe it.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Mother nature, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, how she is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she can make up her mind and change her mind whenever she wants.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  You know, like -- you know, when they said the other day [NOISE] that it was going to rain and stuff [SIGH] -- see that's what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I watch a lot of the news for [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- how the w- weather is going be.  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, the thing because now [SIGH] you don't really know how to dress [SIGH] -- this weather's -- they're so crazy.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I know.  Lately I don't even know how to dress my -- my own daughter.  [SIGH]  You know, I was going to dress her all warm today and t- this morning it was a little chilly.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  You got that right.  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, I dressed her a little warm and, forget it, it was like eighty degrees out.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  I was [SIGH] s- sweating.  [SIGH]  Oh, I was just p- picturing her -- I was, um, [LIPSMACK] at my college and I was just picturing my daughter s- sweating.  [SIGH]  I was, like, ready to go home and just change her into shorts and stuff.  [SIGH]  I felt bad, you know.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
R:  Like, I mean, you don't know how the weather's gonna be.
L:  R- right.
R:  You know, the Weather Channel -- the w- weather guy's not always accurate.  [SIGH]  And you -- you can't --
L:  [NOISE]  This is what I'm saying.  Those couple of days he was saying it was going to rain and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I was listening in to the -- to Dave Price [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] and -- on Channel Fox Five News.  [SIGH]  He was like, "It's gonna rain" and then all of a sudden it was all sunny and everything.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  Like he said this weekend it's going to rain.  Why the weekend?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean during the week [SIGH] I was like nothing, nothing.  [SIGH] I said the people have to [NOISE] -- have to go to, ... you know, work and everything.  I have to go to work but I'm a carpenter so [SIGH] I go to work whenever there's work.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And, basically [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- um, you have people going out there and y -- they don't -- you -- they don't know -- [SIGH] like he said it's going to rain the other day.  It didn't rain at all.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh!
L:  It didn't rain at all.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well today I was kind of hoping for rain --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this way it would cool it off, [SIGH] you know, but --
L:  You did not!  It just n- -- today was the first day [NOISE] we had a nice day.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  You know, I know, i- it's surprising we -- i -- i in May no less [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH]  We've been --
R:  -- you know, where's June?
L:  -- walking around like it's been, um, fall weather.
R:  Yep.  [MN]  Last year I forget it [NOISE] -- around this time we were all sweating.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, it was hot.
R:  It was beautiful.
L:  [NOISE]  It was beautiful.
R:  And the weather guys they were pretty accurate I have to say [NOISE] -- last year, you know.  [SIGH]  This year, forget it.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, this year -- I don't know what's going on.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I don't know what's going on.  [SIGH]  Um, how is it out there in Long Island because [SIGH] that's another thing, every morning I hear about Long Island and how [SIGH] the traffic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is and how the commute is.
R:  Oh, forget it.  It's getting more --
L:  It's crazy.
R:  -- and more congested.  [SIGH]  You got [SIGH] all the railroads -- they're doing all of them at once.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And then, they don't even tell you that on the news, like which ones are being done during the day.  [SIGH]  [MN]
L:  Right.
