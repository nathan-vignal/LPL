R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, um -- are -- where are you from?
L:  Uh, I'm from --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the south and you?
R:  Pardon?
L:  I'm from the south, and you?
R:  I'm from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- midwest, Illinois.
L:  Uh, Illinois, nice.  Also, uh --
R:  Is this your first time or have you done this before?
L:  Yes, this is my first time and you?
R:  This is my second time.
L:  Oh, so [LAUGH] --
R:  I try -- I tried it a couple days ago [NOISE] and it was really -- it wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too bad at all.
L:  Huh.
R:  I w- -- I was --
L:  S- --
R:  -- I was ver- -- I was pleasantly surprised how --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- how easy it was.
L:  So, um --
R:  So -- how do you, uh, catch up on the news?
L:  Uh, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, only get it on the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on online, uh, news sites, uh, every --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- once in a while from a news magazine.
R:  [NOISE] Oh really? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Huh.
L:  And, uh --
R:  That's kinda interesting.
L:  And you?
R:  Oh, I, uh, try to read the newspaper every day and so I glance at the headlines and everything and then, uh [NOISE] -- I'm in the car getting my stuff out, that's why it's beeping here.  Um, I, uh, [NOISE] [SIGH] glance at the headlines, anything strikes my fancy I read it.  I mostly look more at the local news, we're a smaller community here so it's more important that you know what's going on with everybody else! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No! [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, are --
L:  Yeah, I'm a --
R:  Are you from a small town?
L:  I'm a student.  Well, yes, I'm from a small town but I'm currently a student at, uh, college and so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm kind of in the college bubble and, uh, kind of forget that there is something else other than what I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- immediately hear.
R:  Oh yeah, it'd be --
L:  And every once in a while I'll pick up a news magazine and flip through it and see what's going on and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they normally give pretty good summarizations.
R:  [NOISE] Well that's pretty good that you even [NOISE] look because, uh, [NOISE] when I was in college I never even, uh, I had no clue as to what was going on. [NOISE]  But, no, I don't --
L:  I don't know, it's quite [COUGH] --
R:  I was gonna say now my daughter, I know she -- she's just graduated from college -- I know she, uh, she, uh, reads at, um -- she j- -- how they -- she gets the newspaper every day so --
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know how she has time for that 'cause she was a TA this last semester, so [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  Well actually, quite frequently I, uh, I have friends who are news hounds and I just -- I say, "Hey, what's going on?" and they let me know really quick.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  The rundown [LAUGH]
R:  -- that works out good.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That's even --
L:  Yeah, and a friend --
R:  That's even better than reading it, right? [NOISE]
L:  Well, I have a friend who's into poli sci and he reads eleven newspapers a day like, each from -- like he'll read one from an Arab country and from different Eastern countries and then a couple of US newspapers, and so he's pretty well informed.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, my husband reads, uh, Newsweek every week faithfully, so if there's anything really pertinent he will make sure that I check it out.
L:  Hm.
R:  But, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  [COUGH] Do you read, um, a daily local or do you get like, The New York Times?
R:  No, we l- -- we read the daily [NOISE] loc- local paper.  It probably costs about as much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as The New York Times! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's okay, so I -- right in my hometown it's like [SIGH] -- it -- it -- the newspaper is more expensive than like, the larger cities that are adjacent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that actually, you know, cover some basic national news.
R:  [NOISE] And y- you wouldn't think that that would be -- should be true because, uh, you'd think the larger ones would have more costs tied up in mailing and everything.
L:  Well, actually no, it -- well, how it works out is that, uh, the printing presses and so forth for the larger ones are better paid for --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, because they have a larger subscription.
R:  And more sort of --
L:  So they have more subscri- subscribers.
R:  -- more efficient probably.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [SIGH] --
L:  And because there's a -- there's a basic cost, like, if you're gonna produce one issue or if you're gonna produce, you know, a hundred thousand issues, and so, I mean, a hundred thousand copies or one copy, so [SIGH] that basic cost is offset more by --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a larger subscription rate.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But it's pretty interesting.
R:  Now, where did you hear about this study? [NOISE]
L:  Oh, uh, the study?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I, um, actually I -- I'm pretty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- interested in publishing at the -- in terms of a ca- --
R:  Do what?
L:  -- future career.
R:  Do what?
L:  So I -- I'm interested in publishing as a future career.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I kind of perk up whenever I hear someone talking about the operational costs of, you know, putting a newspaper --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or a -- so, kinda like -- that's like the part of economics class that I really pay attention to or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] [LAUGH], it's my interest.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, [COUGH] -- how did you find out about this study?
R:  Well, I, uh, this, um, right before Christmas I, uh, [NOISE] was online and I was looking at like, money saving sites and I looked at this site called RMC, it was a refunding magazine. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, s- uh, somebody -- I j- -- I subscribed to the magazine and then somebody -- they have a little webpage -- [NOISE] and somebody, uh, suggested on the webpage, "You might be interested in doing this".  So I thought, "Oh, this sounds kinda interesting, we can handle this here".  So I tried it. [SIGH]  How'd you hear about it?
L:  Um, actually I study linguistics and I, uh, happened upon the site through a link that I receive through the department --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and navigating around the site, the LDC site, and, uh, saw this and I was like, "Hm, [LAUGH] I c- should do this".  And just so --
R:  Oh, um, the -- by linguistics, does that mean like, anything with -- my sister has -- is an audiologist.  You probably aren't going --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  You aren't going into that side of it are you?
L:  Mm, no --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't believe so.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, linguistics is like the study of language --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, basically all aspects of language and a -- languages in so many like, different parts of your life.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Like, it, uh -- you know, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's a social linguistics side, there's psycho linguistics and then there's like, uh, there's an actual like, the mechanics of it, you know, the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- syntax, the semantics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we study how it goes together and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how you -- these things correlate and [inaudible], uh --
R:  And wha- -- how do -- what, uh, ki- -- what does that -- what kind of job would that be?  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Well, uh, oh yeah.  Well, um, right now [inaudible] linguistics like, they use [SIGH] uh, they study --
R:  Like, in commercials or something, or ...?
L:  Well[?] -- well, [several inaudible words] linguistics is like, computers that do like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- voice recognition or, um, transcription.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, so you have to like, tell the computer exactly how a language works.  But before you can tell them you actually have to figure it out for yourself.
R:  Oh, and see --
L:  And --
R:  -- major areas [NOISE] gonna have their own speech pattern.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And so -- um, 'cause I -- I can -- I know a big speech pattern in this area and I don't do it but a lotta -- it's a big German community and they go -- they end each c- -- each sentence with not.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, because the negations at the end for German.
R:  Yeah.  They say, "You're going to town, not?"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, this is -- this is -- that's the problem. [LAUGH]  Uh, "It's the cutest guy, not?" [LAUGH]  It's like, whoops!  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No, it's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I enjoy it, it's -- it's a fun field, it's not -- the application isn't like -- is readily apparent, it's like, say, studying medicine but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, it's definitely --
R:  Well that's what I was wondering what kind of job you would get.
L:  Well, I mean, [SIGH] right now there's a lot in terms of like, um, d- what I was saying about computational linguistics.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, then there's like, also, uh, people use it and then they go onto grad school and they go into academics, they become academics.
R:  Oh, so then they do more research.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, i- a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has to do with research to the other things, like, other s- -- other like, technologies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can be furthered.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like, really right now the really hot field is voice transcription for software and voice recognition for security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah, I can see that.
L:  -- before like, anything of these things can work, any of these computers can work, we have to program exactly what all these little things, see and like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, programing a computer to understand like, simple things, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that you say or versus how I would say them because we're from different regions.  And understanding --
R:  So, would they have each -- would they have -- each region have their own voice recognition?
L:  Well see, the thing is like, basically --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all speakers of -- of English --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to understand like, I give a command or if you give a command or if someone from the German community gives a -- a command, right?
R:  Right, we still understand.
L:  We still understand it.  So the trick is getting a computer to function this way.
R:  Oh.
L:  And to do that we have to establish all these different like, rules and patterns and --
R:  Oh!  Okay, okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I guess we probably oughta get back to the, uh, news --
L:  Huh!
R:  -- thing. [LAUGH] 
L:  News.  Well, [LAUGH] uh, current events.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, I --
R:  Uh, we do watch CNN, do you watch CNN at all?
L:  I --
R:  As --
L:  Well, my -- my school doesn't really have, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cable access --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- very much.  Like, in a few public spaces and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just spend so much time like, between the library and so therefore I really don't have time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to sit down and watch it.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]  Oh --
L:  Every once in a while I go to New York Times dot com and read that or --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  So that's about my only source of the news.
R:  How about -- how about like, during the Iran contra thing, did you -- didn't you watch, uh, didn't you g- [SIGH] --
L:  I was actually out to dinner with friends the night --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, uh, Bush made his, uh --
R:  His [NOISE] decision?
L:  Pretty much declaration --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- war, um, and so we watched that on the TV in the restaurant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we were at.  We were like, "I can't --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- believe this is happening".  But, um --
R:  So, did you watch it on CNN or did you, uh ... watch --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- j- like, just the --
L:  I think it was on, uh --
R:  -- NBC, CBS?
L:  I think it was CNN.
R:  CNN?  That's the one --
L:  [several inaudible words] CNN.
R:  -- we -- we usually like to watch.  I also
