R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Karen.
L:  Karen?  Hi, I'm Lisa, I'm calling from New York.
R:  Oh hi, Lisa, I'm in Huston.
L:  Oh, I talked to someone from Houston the other night.
R:  Oh, that's funny! [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  Well, uh, they're asking us about the current events.
L:  Um --
R:  I really -- I don't really watch TV news that much or radios, mostly, uh, my husband talks to me, or people at work.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every morning I try to listen to the radio and catch at least a -- a couple of news updates and then I, um, if I'm on the Internet I like to look at msnbc dot com --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because it gives you like, the breakdown of the highlights of the day, um, international and what's in the United States.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, we have a lot of daily papers up here in New York so I try to pick one up every other day or so and then read the weekend papers.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like, I don't know, um, if they wanna know if we wanna -- if we read local news or international news but, you know, sometimes I go full force and I read everything I can.  Sometimes it's just too time consuming and I'll take a break and won't do it at all.
R:  Right.  Well, I know mostly we watch, when we do watch any news, uh, 'cause my husband records it, and then that's what we'll watch, is, uh, the national news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause when it gets to the local news it's so depressing it's, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All the murders --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all the robberies and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So really I don't mind the int- -- uh, the national news that much, because it's a good overview of, you know, everything that's going on.
L:  Mhm.  What kind of -- do you w- -- do you watch -- what news channel do you prefer?
R:  We just watch, uh, he watches, um, [LIPSMACK] and I think it's NBC is who he watches and, uh, we just get regular TV, we don't get cable or anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we just watch the regular station.
L:  Well that's all right.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's -- you know, there's more stuff on just regular stations than we have time to see, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know.  And so that's why specifically have to record that, um, the news --
L:  Which one do you record?
R:  It's the, uh, nightly news --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with Peter Jen- -- no, not Peter Jennings, with, uh, who is that guy he likes?  Oh, my husband records it so -- and then we play it back --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and watch it together.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you watch it after it airs?
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, obviously if you record it, but I mean do you watch it later in the night I guess?
R:  Well, no, it's actually after we've, uh -- it's recording while we're, uh, getting dinner ready and, you know, getting home from work and everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, uh, sometimes during dinner we'll watch it.  Uh, we have a -- a tivo system, so we can be watching it while it's recording the rest of it.
L:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, those systems are amazing.
R:  Yeah.  So that's what we do, we, you know, that way we can watch all of it and we don't have to stop at a certain time for the, um --
L:  Sure.  Or stop for the commercials.
R:  Right, exactly.  And then on the radio, he listens to a lot of talk radios and I'm sure they do a lotta that, you know, discussing the, uh, topics of, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- current events.
L:  The topics of the day.
R:  But my one, mas- --
L:  Sure.
R:  Mainly I listen to a -- it's a contemporary Christian station --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's mostly -- it h- does have highlights but mostly it's music and things like that.
L:  So you probably wouldn't like the Howard Stern, uh, news updates in the morning then, huh?
R:  No, probably not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my cup of tea! [LAUGH]
L:  Right!
R:  Well, we listened to him when we were lived in Pennsylvania actually.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  And he was -- that's the first time I'd ever m- -- it was about, m- uh, ten years ago I guess, that's the first time I'd ever heard of him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my husband just loved him, you know, it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he w- -- he just thought he was a riot. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I used to work in radio so --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- I listen even though I don't even always agree with what he's saying, I think it's interesting and practices --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the right of free speech and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think Robin does pretty good, well rounded news updates --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- whether it be news of the weird or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- local stuff or current stuff, and just listening to their commentary, you know, and them interacting on the news --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- gets me thinking.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's just a different perspective you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's not [inaudible] gonna be news you're gonna see on the TV either.
R:  E- right, exactly, yeah.  Now, for newspapers, uh, it's funny, I used to read 'em when we were in Pennsylvania 'cause they had a good local paper.  Well, here we only have one newspaper and we did have t- --
L:  The Houston Chronicle.
R:  Yeah.  We had --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- two but they closed down The Post, so now we just have The Chronicle and we -- we don't take it.  W- -- I will sometimes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we'll buy it on the weekend, you know, we'll buy the b- paper but ...
L:  Sure.
R:  'Cause they won't deliver it just -- i- if we wanted it just like, on Saturday or Sunday, which is the one --
L:  They won't do it?
R:  No, they want you to buy, you know, the whole week or they'll make you take four days and that's what they call the weekend, and we're just like, you know, we just want like, one or two days, so we just buy it.
L:  Well that's no good.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  Even The Times here will deliver just the Sunday paper.
R:  Really?  See, now, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to me that doesn't make sense, why they wouldn't do that.  But anyway --
L:  Yeah, I think it would be their -- worth their while.
R:  Right.
L:  Hm.
R:  And another thing, get it in the house you'd think they would but ...
L:  Exactly.  Hm.
R:  Anyway.  So you were in radio?  What did you do?
L:  I just -- when I was in -- going to school I worked at a radio and kind of programmed it and set up --
R:  Oh cool.
L:  -- um, music programming as well as the news and the sports coverage.
R:  For the, uh, for the school?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, for the -- it was a school station.  What school?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I was down in the south at, um, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
R:  Oh, okay, cool.
L:  So yeah, that was a cool experience and it made me appreciate radio, and I think that's why now I like listening to that while I get ready in the morning.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and sometimes I listen to, um, AM radio.  Like, on the-- on the weekends I might, um, and I listen to some of the like, syndicated programs on AM radio.  Sometimes talk stuff about current events but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, maybe once or twice a month, it's not very common.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess I just don't make the time to do it, you know?  And then you have to really listen, you can't be doing something else 'cause then you get distracted.
R:  Right, and it's not just background.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You have to be paying attention to it 'cause there is so many, you know, they have the different callers that come in and so many different --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- opinions and everything, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, you really have to pay attention to it.
L:  Huh, like a Sleepless in Seattle.  Have you ever seen that movie?
R:  Exactly, yes! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That gets 'em involved.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Anyway ...  Yeah, unfortunately I get most of my news from people that we -- at work or my husband and then I do watch, like I said, the, um, [LIPSMACK] the national --
L:  How do you get it at work?
R:  Well, the friends just talk about stuff.  They tell -- you know, they say, "Did you hear about this?  Did you hear about that?" and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then I'll just tell 'em yes or no I heard something or I didn't hear much about it, and so they'll tell me what they've heard on the news or heard on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, read in the paper and stuff.
L:  Have you been following much of the, uh, war coverage?
R:  No, not much.  I mean, I do, like when something new comes out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I just don't -- I guess I -- I try to -- I [MN] -- I hear what comes out, like especially on the, uh, the nightly news, but then I don't go and just, you know, [MN] look for it like in the paper and look or it on the radio and look for it on another station 'cause it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's like the same thing over and over and over and over.
L:  Yeah, the same --
R:  You know.
L:  -- stories written are told five or ten different ways --
R:  Exactly, and --
L:  -- and there's only so many w- -- yeah, you don't wanna know as much as the soldiers do.  Sometimes I feel like I wanna know enough so I feel intelligent enough to talk about it but I don't wanna kn- -- you know, I don't feel like the media should be on the front line --
R:  Right.
L:  -- covering this war like it's a politician running for an election.
R:  Right.  Well, in the beginning I was more attentive, I was listening more, before we were actually in the war.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because that's when you wanna know what is the reasoning, what's going on?
L:  Exactly.
R:  But then when the war actually started, you know, the first few, uh, broadcasts, that was fine 'cause you wanted to see it, you wanted, you know, know what was going on, but after that it's just kind of, okay, now let the military do what they're doing 'cause, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're over there and we've gotta protect our guys, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, let 'em -- let 'em get on with what they're doing instead of, you know, [SIGH] running around with the cameras and stuff, so --
L:  Yeah, it's not like I wanna forget them, but it's like, let them fight the war and --
R:  Exa- --
L:  -- we don't need minute to minute updates per se.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  You know, 'cause I always wonder about that, when they show everything on the news, doesn't that also show it to the enemy as well?  I mean, you know, the other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- side's seeing the same thing, so if we're showing 'em all this stuff, um, it's like --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- I don't w- -- I don't want 'em to know that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, with the technology today, I mean, we can watch TV in Iraq and I'm sure they have satellites to watch our televisions too and --
R:  Well, of course --
L:  You know.
R:  -- you know they would.  Yeah.
L:  And of course, I mean, you would hope the government would keep certain things secret so that --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Not everybody know --
R:  Or maybe what they're telling 'em is, uh, what we want 'em to know, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe that's it too --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's all a grand plan and we're just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- little peons in the puppet gallery.
R:  Exactly.  And we're just going, "Oh wow!"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But I normally like, uh, when, uh, when the two towers came down, were -- were you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there in New York?
L:  Yes.
R:  When that happened?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yes.  Very close, or ...?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  Fairly close.
R:  Well, I hate to say this now, I did the same thing, I watched and I got all the information but then I finally had to just turn the TV off because it was the same thing over and over, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Initially.  And then it -- and then something new would come up and I'd watch that for a while.  So tell me what happened with you.
L:  I- in that case, I mean, I was glued to the TV for about --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- five days.
R:  Well, of course.
L:  You know.
R:  I mean --
L:  And I was actually document
