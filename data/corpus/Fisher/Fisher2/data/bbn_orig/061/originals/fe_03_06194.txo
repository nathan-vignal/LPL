R:  [NOISE] Honey --
L:  H- --
R:  -- I'm on the phone.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  My name's Pam, I'm in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, Greenville, Ohio.
R:  Ho.  I'm Yvonne, I'm in Louisa, Virginia.
L:  Well, they left a message --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to talk about hobbies.
R:  Right.  Have you done this before? [LAUGH]
L:  No, this is my first time.
R:  This is my first time too.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, as far as hobbies go --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- let's see.  Uh, it's really sad to say but my hobby is kind of my work. [LAUGH]
R:  And what do you do?
L:  I absolutely love it.  It's -- I'm a travel agent.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yes, and I worked out of the home forever and, um, I do this now from my house on the computer.
R:  That's awesome. [LAUGH]
L:  And so one of the wonderful side effects is I get to travel a lot. [LAUGH]
R:  I bet.  [MN]  You know, I was just on the computer today spending all kinds of time looking up information for a big road trip we're taking next month and so that's, uh -- I can relate to that, that's awesome.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How long have you been doing that?
L:  I've been doing it now since, uh, September.
R:  September, wow, that's great.
L:  And we -- we specialize in Disney, so I -- I would consider one of my best hobbies is going down to Disney doing hands on training. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's great.
L:  I love that and, uh, I like to shop with my daughter and, um, jeez, I don't have a whole lotta time for hobbies.
R:  Right.  How much, um, do you -- how much do you work outta your house?  I mean, how much time does that involve?  Is that a full time job or ...?
L:  Well, yeah, I'm basically available twenty four seven.  And --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so in other words, if somebody beeps on my computer I just go in and take it but if they don't, I do my housework.
R:  Oh.
L:  So it's real, real nice.
R:  That's great.
L:  Do you -- do you bike or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- do any kind of exercising or anything like that?
R:  I, um -- well, I do exercise but I mostly do it just to stay in shape, I don't consider it a hobby by any means. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I, um --
L:  I have to. [LAUGH]
R:  I am sort of a summer bum, I enjoy the pools and the beaches and hiking and biking and that sort of thing.  And of course I have three very small children who make some of that pursuit a little difficult now because you can't ride a bike with three little ones behind you very well.
L:  That is true.
R:  Um --
L:  That is true.
R:  And so I sort of -- now that I have children I have sort of taken up a lot of my hobby time is involved in scrap booking.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  And I've gotten very involved in that and, um, usually of course it's not something I do weekly, I usually pick a -- a weekend or a week and I spread everything out on the dining room table and that's about all I get done for a whole week and my house falls apart while I do it.
L:  It doesn't take long.
R:  And then I [LAUGH] -- well, it depends on how complex the pages get.  I --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  I'm not what I consider a really talented scrap booker but --
L:  No, what I meant is, it doesn't take long for the house to go to --
R:  Oh no, that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's true, it does not take long.
L:  About one day off from that and my house goes awry.
R:  That's -- uh, well, do you have children living at home?
L:  Yeah, but they're nineteen and sixteen so it's a little bit easier.
R:  I reckon they could tear it up just about as well as my two year old could, given the [LAUGH] --
L:  I can't complain because believe it or not, they do a lot of housework for me, so I can't complain.
R:  Well --
L:  I'm real lucky.
R:  [NOISE] I, uh, I -- I -- mine aren't old enough to do that just yet but hou- housework is the lowest thing possible --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on my hobby list, so -- I'll -- I'll find any hobby to do as an excuse for not doing the housework! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I guess I'm pretty bad, I -- I've worked so much and [MN] -- and like I said, it was always out of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the home, that I really never developed much of a hobby.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Years ago I liked to do a lot of crafting where I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- made the sweatshirts and the country [MN] -- I don't know, maybe you're not even old enough --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- the country stuff was really in.
R:  The fabric painting and stuff like that?
L:  All kinds, yeah.
R:  My mother used to do that.
L:  Yeah.  I did things like that and I just absolutely loved it but I kinda got away from it and now to me the -- the job is -- is -- I mean, not really called a hobby but it's really a new thing to pursue --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I'm doing it, you know, going at it full tilt --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I just love it.
R:  Well, and of course a lot of my old hi- -- I -- I grew up doing competitive gymnastics [NOISE].
L:  Oh.
R:  And so while I can't really do that in a hobby sense anymore, I do [NOISE] coach a couple of classes a week so that my daughter can do gymnastics.
L:  Neat.
R:  And so I -- I try to stay with that a little bit.
L:  H- --
R:  And my husband and I, we live on about forty acres in a very rural area and so we have a couple of horses and a handful of chickens and a big garden and --
L:  So you've got a lot --
R:  -- um, I guess a lot of people would call that hobbies too, but --
L:  Oh sure, sure.
R:  Little bit here and a little bit there.
L:  You like the great outdoors.
R:  I do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do.  If it was up to me we would have June weather twelve months a year.
L:  That sounds good to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That sounds good to me.  It's just nothing but raining and dreary, we haven't really even had a spring here yet.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  If it's not freezing out it's dreary and raining, so we'll probably hit a hu- --
R:  Well, that makes it hard to pursue outdoor things.
L:  Yeah.  A hundred degrees right off of the bat --
R:  Right.
L:  -- probably what'll happen.
R:  Right.  Now, is Greenville in northern Ohio or southern?  Or not either?
L:  Southern, southern.
R:  Southern, yeah.
L:  We're cl- -- we're about ninety miles north of Cincinnati.
R:  [NOISE] Oh okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I wish I had -- you know, talking about travel, I wish I could make that a more legitimate hobby but unfortunately you gotta have money to travel! [LAUGH]
L:  Yes you do.  I've got a lot of different, uh, places I have to actually have experience in before my company will actually send me leave for that particular area.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, they want you to be well rounded where you -- where you're sending people they want you educated.
R:  Right.
L:  And they've got several agent programs coming up that I could go to but, you know, till you get your airfare and everything in there, it costs some money and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in today's world --
R:  Well that's one reason we're driving this year for our vacation out to Utah to see my sister and we'll stop at --
L:  That'll be pretty.
R:  -- lots of places along the way but I'm getting in a lot of hiking and camping and stuff like that along the way, so I'm gonna pretend I'm an old college student doing my old hobbies again --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for at least a month anyway! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh boy, you're going --
R:  Then I'll come back and I'll feel like an old woman! [LAUGH]
L:  You're going for a month?
R:  Yes.
L:  Wow, that is nice.
R:  Yeah.  We'll spend a week getting there and I'll stay an actual week with my sister in Utah and then we'll drive back for a week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um --
L:  Well that's gonna be nice.  Kids'll love it.
R:  We're hitting a lot of the -- the national parks on the way, a lot of stuff in and around Colorado Springs and southern Utah and the Grand Canyon.
L:  I've never -- never been out that way.
R:  Oh really?
L:  No.  No.
R:  Oh, see, now, when I was in college I used to do rock climbing and repelling and --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and we used to go down to the canyons all the time and, uh, won't be doing quite that adventurous a trip again with a baby on my hip, I can't do it so much --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but we're gonna -- we're gonna at least do the stroller walking through all the national parks and --
L:  Oh, that'll be neat.
R:  -- we might even see Yellowstone while we're out that direction.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  So we'll see, but --
L:  I guess another thing that I could call my hobby, I have pets.  I got some -- couple of dogs and, uh --
R:  Oh do you?  What kind of dogs?
L:  One's a collie shepherd, he's a small horse.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, he's about ninety pounds and --
R:  That's what I grew up with --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- was half collie, half shepherd, her mother was an albino shepherd and her father looked just like Lassie.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, she was our little ...
L:  Yeah, he's got --
R:  -- pup growing up.
L:  -- [MN] both of 'em in him and you can tell he's both.  Uh, he's got the -- the collie face and mane in the front a little bit but then he's got the -- more of the shepherd coarse salt and pepper hair in the back.  And then I got a twenty pound, um, peek a pooh that's --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- just a terror! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He kinda runs the family, you know how that is.
R:  Well we have a big hound right now but, um, my husband isn't very much into dogs and so he only allows me to have one of those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I told him I wouldn't live out in the middle of nowhere without a dog to bark at night if a stranger came so [LAUGH] --
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Otherwise I'd probably collect every stray in the neighborhood, if my husband --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- didn't put a stop on it, so --
L:  I'm bad.  And they're expensive today.  Boy, I go to the vet and it's a nightmare.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, uh, my -- my collie shepherd, he's, uh, would probably hide under the table if a stranger came in then the little one would tear them apart.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh.  Well, you know, my dog never had, um, I never even heard her bark, I didn't know she had a bark at all until my second daughter was born.  We got -- I had my first daughter before we got the dog and then I had the dog and then I had my second daughter and after that I'm just about afraid to leave her outside, um, [NOISE] if company is coming or something because she's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- fiercely protective --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of my two little ones and, um -- so that's been interesting to me, but [NOISE] --
L:  After the second one?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Jessica's five and when Jessica was about two years old we got Sable and she was -- she always like, hovered near Jessica and everything but she never barked.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then when I brought Erin home from the hospital, boy, if somebody even tried to come into our driveway and her hair would stand up on end and she'd bark and carry on like there was, um --
L:  But she's good with the kids?
R:  Oh, my heavens [NOISE] yes.
L:  Isn't that great?
R:  They sit on her and pull on her ears and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yank on her tail and try to ride her around the back yard and she just sorta gives me that hopeless look like, "How long do I have to endure this before you get them off me?" [LAUGH]
L:  Neat! [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  So --
L:  Well, anyway, it asked --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it said that we -- we should discuss --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how important, uh, hobbies are and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- should you -- do you feel like everybody should have a -- at least one hobby?
R:  I'm --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  Well I don't know about everyone but coming from the young mom perspective, I think if I didn't have a h- couple of hobbies I would be downright insane.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Something for me, that me time.
R:  -- I -- I rate them pretty important, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  It's just a matter of taking time for me.
R:  Right.
L:  I just tend to like to take care of the others and the husband and this and that --
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and if -- I always have good intentions at the end of the day or tomorrow I'll do this and ...
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- then it goes to the next day.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was just gonna say, you know, I think that my church gives me a real outlet for hobbies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, another hobby I have is photography and that sort of ties into the scrap booking, and once a month at my church we have some
