L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's --
L:  Hi --
R:  -- Laurie.
L:  Hi, Laurie.  I'm Natalie. 
R:  How are ya?
L:  Good, how you doing?
R:  Pretty good.  I'm a [inaudible] --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
L:  What were you saying?
R:  I said, I'm getting a lot of echoing on my phone. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I don't hear it.  You -- you're coming in clear to me.
R:  Okay.  Good.
L:  Ah, yeah, ah, so, current events.
R:  That's what they wanna know, how you get your information. 
L:  Um, I usually listen to the radio.  I listen to NPR. 
R:  Yeah, where are you from?
L:  I'm from Lansville, Pennsylvania, like, outside of --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- Philly.  How about you?
R:  Okay.  I'm in Arizona.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  But I get most of my information -- actually my husband works for the newspaper here --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- so, um, he, you know, knows the newspaper from cover to back, just because when there's nothing to do at work, you read the newspaper. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  What does he do for the paper?
R:  He's a machinist on the machines that prints it out and stuff.
L:  That's cool.
R:  So, I get most of my information actually secondhand from him, because he just --
L:  Yeah, he'll tell --
R:  -- comes home and tells me.
L:  -- you what he read. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I usually -- I have a TV, but I don't really like to watch it that much.  Like, I don't -- I don't like that news coverage all that much, so I get it from the -- the radio, I listen to the --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- public radio station. 
R:  So that's better for you, as far as --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- getting information, yeah.  Yeah, well, if I don't get it from him, I basically get it from the TV news.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, I mean, I -- I -- I don't, um, you know, sit down and make sure I ha- -- am watching the news at five o'clock every night or anything like that, it's just --
L:  Yeah, same here, like, I'll --
L:  -- if I'm --
R:  Go ahead, sorry.
L:  If I'm flipping through, you know, and something catches my attention, then I'll listen to it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, sometimes I will, I'll watch it on the TV.  But, yeah, I'm not real consistent about it.  Like, I'll turn on the radio driving to work, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not all the time, so ...  I had to turn it off for a little while 'cause of the war.  I just -- like, I was tuned in some of the time, but then I just couldn't take too much of it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I did a lot on, um, the TV with that, too.  But then I just couldn't stand watching it any more. 
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, the same thing happened to me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But, I mean, I couldn't understand how they could, um, show you all that on TV.  I -- I don't know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it just seemed strange to me.  
L:  I know, it -- it's too depressing to watch and then they mad when the Iraqi stations are showing, you know, their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- coverage of it.  It's like, well, we're doing the same thing.  [LAUGH] I mean, it's just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you don't get the newspaper delivered?
L:  Ah, no, I don't get it delivered.  I sometimes read it at -- like, at work if it's around.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't get one delivered.  But [several inaudible words] around here is the Enquirer and my parents get that, so ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometime, I read that. 
R:  Well -- well, we don't even get the paper.  You would think my --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- husband working there we would --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- get it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, he probably -- it's a busman's holiday for him.  He's like, "I see enough of the paper, I don't want it in my house".
R:  Right. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, he's -- he sees it every day so ...
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Anyway --
L:  What paper does he work for?
R:  It's called the Arizona Republic.
L:  Oh.
R:  But they also, um, they also print the New York Times here for it, ah, the -- the disti- distribution out here of New York Times, which is --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- kinda where -- yeah.
L:  So, he -- he gets to read that, too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's pretty nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a good paper. 
R:  Yeah, it is.  'Cause my -- my dad lives back in New Jersey, that's where I'm originally from and that's --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- the only pap- -- that's the only paper he gets.  He can't stand, ah, ah, whatever the local papers are around there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ... [COUGH] I guess, um, for back east, a lot of people do the New York Times, I don't know. 
L:  Yeah, I mean, around here a lot of people, they do -- they'll do both.  Like the Philly Enquirer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is a big one, um, and it's not bad.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then the New York Times is definitely, like, the most comprehensive, I think. 
R:  Right.  I don't know, what else? [LAUGH] How long is it --
L:  Yeah, I'm, like, dry. [LAUGH] I mean, it's, like, a ten minute conversation, I think we're up to, like, three or four. [LAUGH] I'm, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know what else to say about the paper.  But, um, but --
R:  Well, I learnt from my husband, um, working at the paper, that you can't necessarily believe everything that is printed in the paper, and I mean, most people think, you know, if it's printed in the paper, it's gospel, you know.
L:  Yeah, like the integrity of it.  That's interesting.
R:  Right.
L:  How does he, ah, how does he find that out?
R:  Just because, um, of articles that have been written in there, you know, about actually different things going on at the newspapers itself and he knows, you know --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- it's all bullshit.
L:  -- and he knows --
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true, I used to work for, like, a school newspaper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we would really kinda print things the way that, like, a lot of times you just sort of gave the -- the slant on the story that you wanted people to get, you know.  Like, it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it wasn't always the most hone- -- and sometimes it was unconscious, you would just print the way you perceived it had happened and --
R:  Right --
L:  -- not realise --
R:  -- that's exactly it.
L:  -- you were doing it. 
R:  That's th- -- I mean, I'm -- I'm sure that they're not purposely trying to, um, give you wrong information.  But they're giving what they want you to know.  They're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not necessarily the whole story, you know. 
L:  Totally.  And the other thing is, ah, if you print something incorrectly and then and you don't know it and you go back and retract it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some people don't read the retraction, you know --
R:  That's --
L:  -- they just see the headline, and that sticks in their head. 
R:  Yeah --
L:  So ...
R:  -- exactly. 
L:  'Cause you never know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who's reading your paper every day and who is reading it, like, once a week or once a month.  
R:  That's true.
L:  That was then -- there was a movie called The Paper that had [inaudible].  It was really good.
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's, ah, it was directed by Ron Howard.
R:  Huh.
L:  And it's called The Paper.  A great movie.  Um --
R:  I'll have to check it out.
L:  Yeah, it's really fun.  Got Michael Keaton in it.  So ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm, like, speaking of things that are [several inaudible words].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But [several inaudible words] --
R:  Have you done --
L:  -- sorry, [NOISE] what's that?  Hello.
R:  What?  Hello.
L:  I don't hear what you said.  Yeah, I'm still here.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I didn't hear what you said. 
R:  I don't say anything.  I  don't know, it sounded like somebody else talking. 
L:  Oh, actually --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- sorry, I was in the other room.
R:  Okay.  Well, I didn't know it a- -- at the end of ten minutes does the recording come on?  Or maybe that's what it was, I don't know.  Have you done --
L:  I didn't --
R:  -- these --
L:  -- hear anything on the phone.
R:  Have you done these before?
L:  No, this is my first one. 
R:  Me too.  So I don't know how it ends. [LAUGH] 
L:  H- hang on, I can ask my friend Dave, 'cause he's done it --
R:  Okay.
L:  Hey, Dave, at the end of ten minutes, does the recoding come on to tell you -- okay, you just keep on -- okay, yeah, my friend who's done it and he said that a recording will come on to tell you.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, me too.  I -- I sent it off to a bunch of my friends 'cause I was like, "Hey, you know, it's easy money", but I didn't try it myself first. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...  Um --
R:  Well [inaudible] --
L:  -- but this is the same thing.  They're like, "It's hard to stay on topic for the whole time, but otherwise it's fine".  
R:  Well, yeah.   I mean, I don't know, um, I don't know how long we've been on the phone for. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know, probably about six minutes or so.  So ...  Um --
R:  It s- -- it seems like ten, doesn't it? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know.  Well, it's a long time to talk.  I mean, you gotta think, like, how of- -- like, how often do you talk about what you read --
R:  I know.
L:  -- or see on TV for ten minutes, [LAUGH] you know, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most of my conversations with my friends are less than ten minutes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But ...
R:  Ah, let's see, what else.  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, let's see, when you watch the TV news, do you, like, watch the -- the mainstream stations or ...? 
R:  Yeah, well, I --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- don't know.  We have -- um, I don't know what stations you have back there, but I mostly watch Fox --
L:  Oh, yeah, we have Fox.
R:  You do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I thought that was only out here.  But, yeah ... that's what I'll watch for the news wise.  Or I -- I'm not even sure, to tell you the truth, 'cause like I said, I'll just flip through the channels and whatever catches my attention.
L:  Yeah, we have --
R:  You know.
L:  -- at the -- at the gym that I go to at work, they always have it tuned to CNN, the n- news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's just depressing, 'cause you're, like, you're at the gym and you're, like, relaxing and getting out, you know, exercising and getting out of your stress mode and then you go to the stretching room, and there's CNN and they're, like, giving you all the world news and the terrorists --
R:  Oh, yeah, and it's always depressing news, never good.
L:  Totally, totally.  So ...
R:  You know. [MN] That's why I stopped watching the news completely just for that reason, just because every time you flip it on, I mean, it was just some horror story.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, like when September eleventh happened, I didn't have a TV set so I didn't actually see the -- I mean, I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- heard about it, I listen to the radio on that topic and I heard about it, but I --
R:  That was horrible.
L:  -- didn't see it happen and so, like, I came -- I went to my parents' house, like, a week after it happened and they were still showing that awful footage of the plane crashing in --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and I was, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, I, like, gasped and held my hands to my face, and my sisters were like, "What, you haven't seen it a hundred times?"  And I was like --
R:  I know --
L:  -- "This is the first --"
R:  -- they just --
L:  "-- time I've seen it". [MN]
R:  They just showing it over and over and ov- -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know. It was like --
L:  [inaudible] -- it desensitizes you to it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, like, I think --
R:  So --
L:  -- it's hard to -- to get your news from TV and you get an imagine with it too, 'cause you're -- you never know what you're going to s- -- what they're going to put up there.  So ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Yeah, that was pretty horrible. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did you -- do you know anybody in th- -- that lives in New York, the New Jersey area?
L:  Um, yeah, I knew -- one of my friends was in Urban [inaudible] so he saw the crash happen through his window, but he was okay.  But, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- yeah, he was pretty shook up.  We couldn't get in touch with anybody.  So, I guess you had the same problem with reaching the family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like you couldn't get through on the phone for days.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, two days.
R:  It was pretty bad.  But, I mean, here in Arizona, besides worldwide news, I mean, all the local news is -- well, now that it's, um -- um, swimming pool -- you know, people are starting to sw- -- it's like ninety three degrees here now --
L:  Really?  Oh, my God.
R:  -- every day -- every single day on the news, there's a kid that has drowned in the pool.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  Another drowning.  I mean, it's just horrible.
L:  That's awful.
R:  Yeah, it's really --
L:  Yeah, here we get people that are -- like, the- they're dying of heat stroke in the city apartment buildings and stuff and ...
R:  Yeah. 
L:  God --
R:  Well, we got --
L:  -- they just always co- -- and you have to wonder, like, are they covering a disproportionate amount of negative stuff, like, because, like, the whole anthrax thing, like, I think, like, three or four people were affected, and you're, like, well, you know, was it -- was it just that it was getting a lot of coverage and it was not really as big of an epidemic as you would have thought?
R:  Right. 
L:  You can't tell.  
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I know, I'm running out too [LAUGH] --
