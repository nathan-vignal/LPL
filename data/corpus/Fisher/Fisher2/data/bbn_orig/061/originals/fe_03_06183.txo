R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, my name's Cathy.
R:  Hi, Cathy, my name is Jen.
L:  Hi, Jen.  I'm from Iowa.
R:  Oh, I'm from California.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH] Nice to meet you.
L:  Um, I guess the topic was where I get my news?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, a lot of times I get it off the Internet.
R:  Me too.
L:  Um, I am very busy and so I very -- I -- I do get the newspaper but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just skim the front.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And don't really read it from cover to cover.
R:  Yeah.  Did you used to?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Now I really [MN] rely on the Internet.  It's faster, I get what I want.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think -- I think too that it, um, I can get more pr- broad perspective than just my local --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] you know, when the war was on I -- I went to BBC and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to the different networks, not just -- not just CNN or, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Fox, uh, I went to a lotta different sources to see what other countries were thinking about what we were doing too.
R:  And, um, were you satisfied with like, BBC coverage?
L:  Somewhat.  Yeah, I thought -- I thought they were pretty fair.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, actually I thought they were less slanted than a lot of ours were.
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm not sure that any of ours were unbiased.
L:  I know! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know!  And -- and so I was --
R:  Sadly.
L:  -- looking for other opinions --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too.
R:  D- -- um, were there any particular -- are there particular sites that you go to for news on this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the Internet?
L:  Well, yeah, I do, I go -- there's the BBC, I go to CNN.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I go to, um, well, for weather I go to the Weather Bug.
R:  Mm -- oh, Weather Bug.
L:  I love that one too.
R:  I've never been there.
L:  [LAUGH] I like that one.
R:  Is that just weather bug dot com?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, let's see, what other my -- I -- I do check my local two KN or KGAN.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which is just a local, um, news channel --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just for my local what's happening here in town.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I have to look at my favorites list but --
R:  Do you go to the New York Times?
L:  I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do.
R:  I usually go there and San Francisco Chronicle site.
L:  Oh, I've never tried that one.
R:  Yeah, it's okay.  Um, also my friend lives in London and, uh, she sent me The Guardian.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Apparently that's one that I think a lot of people in Europe read.
L:  Well, I will write that down.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's --
L:  'Cause I was really looking for something different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I was looking for the coverage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes you really need a -- an international perspective.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  Get --
L:  -- we're the propaganda machine! [LAUGH]
R:  I know!  It's so frightening.
L:  It really is.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It really is.  They can go do whatever they want to and spin it how they want to.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And I -- I don't understand why our media has allowed that to happen.  I mean, and we just cover it, we don't ask the tough questions.  They're just lapdogs.
L:  Uh, it's -- I don't understand it either.  In some cases I think they dig too far in the wrong places.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and where they need to be digging they don't even touch it.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, that was one of the things that I liked about, um, BBC radio, is that the interviews, it seemed like the interviewers, they wouldn't let the, um, interviewees give an answer that sort of side stepped the question.
L:  Right, they'd --
R:  They would keep saying, "But you haven't answered the question".
L:  Right, they kept right with it.  I like that a lot.
R:  Yeah, I love it.  And we don't do that here.
L:  No.  [MN]  We let people go around about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We hedge around and -- and skirt the issues --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all over the place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- I -- I don't understand that, I don't know what they're afraid of, if they think --
R:  Well --
L:  -- they'll be taken off the air or ...
R:  I think someone was, uh, I was actually talking to someone about this the other night and they were talking about access and how, you know, it's -- it's -- the number one thing they're trying to get is, you know, to have access to Bush or -- or whoever it is and if they piss him off then they --
L:  [LIPSMACK] They have none.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But that is not an unbiased media.
L:  No it isn't.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And it's not fair.
R:  No, not to us.
L:  No, it is not.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  You know, my daughter was talking to me, she's just new in college.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She's nineteen years old.  And she was talking about media coverage and --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- how to find the truth in it [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I said, "Oh, good luck!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You gotta try a lot of different sources and pick out the grains of truth that are in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They stretch it, they slant it, they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Did she have a class or something that made her start thinking about this or ...?
L:  Cultural anthropology.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Cool.
L:  And so we had a long discussion about it and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they talked about it in class too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I think that's wonderful.  They -- I think they should talk about it earlier.  Like, with my -- I have a son that's in fourth grade.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He had to be thinking about that already.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  You know, I think they just believe whatever's on TV is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- true.
R:  Yeah.  Do they have, um, like, a school newspaper for the fourth grade?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  Huh uh.
R:  Mm.
L:  My middle school daughter does.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They go to a very small school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  His -- he has nineteen kids in his class.
R:  Oh wow, that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nice!
L:  Very small!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see.  Sarah, my oldest daughter, when she graduated high school had, mm, what was it?  Forty three students in her class.
R:  Oh my gosh!
L:  I know! [LAUGH]
R:  What's the population of your town?
L:  It's about three thousand.
R:  Oh my goodness, that's a small town.
L:  Yeah, it's little bitty.  We're ru- very rural. [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, well, we chose to be that way.  My -- my oldest daughter went first to -- her first two years to a very large school, I think there were four thousand in her class.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that just was, well, she just got lost in the shuffle.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  And so I -- we brought her here.  We moved.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's only twenty five miles away but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words].
L:  And so anyway, I just think they need to hit it earlier in -- in education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That teachers don't -- should not shy away from that.
R:  Well, it sounds like, um, you're pretty progressive, is that true of most of the people in your town?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't think so.
L:  No.  I actually live in an Amish community.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  Interesting.
L:  So, no, it's very, um, maybe forty, fifty years backward.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, are the Amish kids at the school?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] Yes, we share with Amish and Mennonite --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, students, plus just regular --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like us.
R:  [SIGH] Interesting.  And so what made you move to this particular town?
L:  The schools.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They are, um -- every student gets individual lesson plans.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [MN] it's -- their teachers make it their business to make sure students succeed.
R:  [MN]
L:  If a student doesn't succeed the teacher feels like they didn't and so it's a --
R:  That's [inaudible].
L:  -- whole different -- it's a lot different than the -- the larger city what we came from.
R:  Uh-huh.  And that was still in Iowa?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was, uh, sorta sink or swim.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and, uh, even though my kids are very gifted, well, that might've been part of the problem, they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- were in the talented, gifted program but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they didn't get challenged enough --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at the other school.
R:  Yeah.  That's exactly what happened to me.  When I was in elementary school my parents had us in a private school and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, sadly they were sort of, I guess trying to hit the middle group --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and so I needed a little bit more and my brother needed sort of remedial type stuff --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and they just simply couldn't do it.
L:  Well, see, that's --
R:  And i- it seems like a lot of schools, they're just so strapped.
L:  Yes.
R:  That they've got to go to the -- the majority, I guess, who are in the middle, I don't know.
L:  Well, that's why we went to this little school, because they have the [LIPSMACK] -- the staff available --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to -- whether you have a class of forty or you have a class of twenty, you get the same one teacher.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, the -- the funding provides that teacher, one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, the teacher with forty students might get a part time aide to come in and help a little --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- here and there but [SIGH] no, the -- it's [MN] -- they need to reduce the class sizes.
R:  Mhm.  And do parents play a role in helping in the classrooms?
L:  Yes, they're there every single day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, in this -- in the little school the -- you know every parent --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- every parent knows who you are, they're all volunteering every day.
R:  Yeah . That's great.
L:  It's a lot different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  And -- and how -- I mean, you know, people, parents I guess in -- in other areas, I think, think that they don't have time to do that sort of thing.  I mean, what's the difference in your town?
L:  We make the time.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Um,
