L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  My name is Nina, how are you?
R:  Just fine.  My name's Julie Okel and I'm calling from Virginia.
L:  I'm calling from St Charles, Missouri.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  Yeah, it is today.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Just fine.
L:  Okay, well, [MN] we got an easy one to talk about here today, hobbies.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, jeez, let's -- let's see, can we get it all in in ten minutes?
R:  [LAUGH] Really.
L:  All right, well, I -- maybe we can go seasonally, 'cause I don't know about you but, like, mine change according to what season it is.  You know, I mean, I --
R:  Oh really?
L:  I -- well, I have the ones that I like all the time but like, you know, in spring I do a lotta gardening, you know, and you --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- obviously don't do that in the winter --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- too much.
R:  I've got gardening to plant today if it finishes drying off just a little bit more.
L:  Oh, you've been hit with the wet stuff too?
R:  Oh yes.
L:  Yeah, we've had it here too.  Have you had pretty much success with your stuff coming up?
R:  Well, I haven't really got any of the underground stuff planted.  I finally got some of my plants set out last week but --
L:  Yeah, your annuals or perennials?
R:  Uh, vegetables.
L:  Oh cool!
R:  I'm a -- I'm a --
L:  Oh, you do that, that's neat.
R:  Yeah, a vegetable garden. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I haven't tried doing that.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I m- -- I used to do like, a couple of tomato plants or something but we're -- we kinda live in the suburbs so there isn't a lot of room in the yard to be doing that.
R:  Oh.
L:  But yeah, that's neat.  What all -- what do you plant?
R:  Well, so far I've got my cabbage planted and my tomatoes and my peppers and my cucumbers --
L:  Oh wow!
R:  -- and cantaloupe.  I'm trying to get my potatoes and onions in today, hopefully.  Hopefully.
L:  Oh neat, okay.
R:  They should've done been in but it's just been so wet.
L:  Yeah.  So you do pretty good though with it, huh?
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So by the middle of summer you're starting to reap your rewards?
R:  Oh yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Neat.  Oh, I like that.  I know my dad's pretty big, or he used to be pretty big on doing that kinda stuff, [inaudible] having his little -- his garden going with, uh, all of his fruits and vegetables and what have you, but he's gotten too old to be doing it nowadays.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, do you have pets too, as another hobby area?
R:  Do I have what?
L:  Any pets, dogs, cats, fish, birds --
R:  I'm getting a horse.
L:  Oh man!  Go for the [inaudible]! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's sixteen and a half hands tall, so --
L:  Oh wow, what kind?
R:  He's a Tennessee Walker and Minnesota Foxtrot.
L:  Oh sweet.
R:  [MN]
L:  You're getting yourself a nice, nice, classy horse.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wow.  And are you gonna --
R:  And I'm getting it on a loaner program, so --
L:  Oh, are you really?  What does that mean?
R:  It means, uh, that I bring the horse to my place and I take care of it like it's my own and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if I like the horse and the horse likes me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then I'll p- actually pay for the horse.
L:  Oh.
R:  If not, then the horse goes back to the original owner.
L:  Oh neat.
R:  Right.
L:  So it's kinda like a foster parent with the intent to adopt?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh cool.
R:  So --
L:  I didn't know they do stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, you can run across a few people, so --
L:  Oh that's neat.  Yeah, well, that's smart too, that ways it's a win win situation that, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if the horse has an attitude with you, I mean, it's just like a kid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's got its own personality.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wow, so you have --
R:  So --
L:  -- you must have a lotta room to have ...
R:  I've got five and a half acres.
L:  Oh, that's perfect.  Oh man, that -- that's a dream I have.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Someday maybe we'll have horses.  I have a little boy who's three and a half and he wants one bad and -- and we're talking about him like, man, I -- I would love to do that, I'd give up everything and just move somewhere to be able to do that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you kinda have to have their school and be in a place, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [inaudible] priorities on it.  So --
R:  So what kind of hobbies do you do?
L:  Um, let's see.  Well, one of my big ones, which I'm kinda doing now is, um, Internet, I enjoy doing that, getting on and, um, you know, just searching and finding things, research, um, email, whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- projects here and there.
R:  Do you --
L:  Um, [MN] --

R:  Right.
L:  You know, [inaudible] ever gone to -- there's one club Start Sampling, have you tried that one?

R:  Refund Makes Cents.
L:  Neat.
R:  It's, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- C.E.N.T.S.
L:  All right, I'm gonna check it out.  There's just a number --
R:  Oh, I just knew that's where you got this information from.
L:  No, I didn't, actually I got this one from, um -- let's see, which one's a good one?  You ever gone to Fat Wallet?
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Try that one, we'll swap.
R:  Okay.
L:  You haven't done that one yet?  Fat Wallet dot com.
R:  Okay.
L:  F.A.T. Wallet, W.A.L.L.E.T. all one word.
R:  Okay.
L:  And if you go on there and go to their forums, oh my Lord, they got more stuff out there, they got freebies, coupons, you name it.
R:  Hm.
L:  It's so cool.  You'll love that one.  If you -- and like, if you ever wanna buy something they got like, deals of the day and where to go.  If you --
R:  Well that's the way this Refund Makes Cents --
L:  Oh good.
R:  -- and it's a chit chat board.
L:  Oh good.
R:  That's the reason I just -- really assumed you'd been on that one.
L:  No, I hadn't been on that one but good, well --
R:  I don't even have a referral slip.
L:  Oh this is cool.  Yeah, I don't either, this one doesn't really have it, it's just everybody comes on and does it.  I have referral ones but, heck, I'm drawing a blank.  Um --
R:  This one is referral but I don't, um, I didn't really get no slips or anything.
L:  Oh bummer.
R:  But it's --
L:  It's probably based on like, your email addy or something.
R:  It's, uh, like, [MN] y- well, you get a magazine each month if you subscribe to it.
L:  Oh man.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Yeah, probably you get an extra one if you refer somebody.
R:  Yeah.  And you can, uh, go online every day and I mean, she puts up the lists of all the good offers for the day like from Amazon dot com and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- this that and the other.
L:  Uh-huh.  And coupon codes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So [inaudible] --
R:  And all of us girls get on there and, I mean, we list the deals that we find at the different stores.
L:  Ain't it fun?
R:  And, uh --
L:  Yeah, that's the best thing, when you go to like, Target or if you go to Coles or whatever you've got is your stores around, W -- uh, Walmart.
R:  Right.
L:  And you put in the deals you find and then you find coupons on it and heck, you can walk out getting stuff free.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they --
L:  You know, Walgreen's is good too.
R:  I mean, they just list on there, I mean, it's just all the time of, "Had to go Target, I found this and --"
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  "-- I found this on clearance and it's --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- not marked".
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  The clearance -- right, especially the stuff that isn't marked 'cause then you can get your butt over there and you could find it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And I found a -- I found some really good stuff using those.  And it's so cool, what a good network, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, the -- the Right Aid Rebate Program.
L:  Right.
R:  Are you familiar with that one?
L:  Right, right.

L:  What's it called, Right Aid?
R:  Yeah.  And Eckerd's[?] and Walgreen?
L:  Oh yeah.  I don't -- I just have Walgreen's, it's the only one around here.
R:  Oh, Walgreen's has got the best from what I've seen.
L:  Oh, I know, I know.  Because --
R:  I don't have a Walgreen's.
L:  You're kidding?
R:  Mm mm.
L:  I thought Walgreen's was on every corner across America.
R:  Oh.  No, I don't have one of them.
L:  Oh, that's a drag.  Huh.  Yeah, 'cause, uh, they've got the rebate thing and then you can use coupons and then you get your -- your little card thing you can charge and then, you know, by the time it's all said and done you can [NOISE] reuse your charge card to buy next month's stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  It's cool.  It's really great.
R:  And those cigarette UPCs and I save those.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't do that, I'm -- I'm not a smoker.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] I'm a reformed one, a long time ago I u- -- well, not a long time ago, [inaudible] --
R:  Well, my -- my boys saved me all their Marlboros and I've -- I've been getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all my premiums this week. [MN]
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good.  Hey, well you know, you could play -- do the coupon exchange thing too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You ever done that, to where you swap stuff?
R:  Yes.
L:  They've got a lotta those out there, it's like, you know, "I've got this, let's trade it for that".
R:  Right.
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah, I've just traded --
L:  Well, jeez, between your -- between your gardening and -- and doing the [NOISE] -- the coupon things, let's see, what else do we got time for?  Uh, let's see.
R:  Uh, candle making, soap making. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really?  Well, yeah --
R:  Crocheting! [LAUGH]
L:  Cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you were -- if you got all those fruits and veggies you probably make jams and jellies and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah, canning and stuff?
R:  Yeah.  I'd thought about going and picking strawberries this week 'cause I've noticed in the paper they're ripe [inaudible] all over, so --
L:  Huh, sounds good.
R:  But I haven't done it yet. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well put that on your To Do list, huh?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Do you have grandchildren?

L:  Right, right.
R:  But we've got the one little one together right now and he's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- into the four wheeling and -- and he's wanting --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a horse, so ...
L:  How old's he, ten?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh well he'll be a good helper to come out and help with the horse.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh yeah, for sure.  That's a great idea.
R:  Yeah, he -- he's real good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he's, uh, in the accelerated reader program at school, he -- he does excellent.

R:  Right, right.
L:  Oh, I love that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's cool.  See, my -- my oldest stepson is gonna be nineteen, so there's really good potential that we're gonna have something pretty close to that, you know, with the --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- with the baby being three, that we have together, you know, in about three or four years, heaven forbid, but it could happen.
R:  Oh yeah.
