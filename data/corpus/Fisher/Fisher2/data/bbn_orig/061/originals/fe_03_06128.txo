L:  Hey, this is --
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is Kerry.
R:  Hi, Kerry.  This is Rose.
L:  Hi, Rose.
R:  Nice to meet you, Kerry.
L:  Good to meet you too. 
R:  I had a best friend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from childhood whose name was Kerry also.  So, that's really cool.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So, I guess our topic is how do we keep up with current events?
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you wanna go first, or shall I?
L:  Um, I'll go first.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, well, I mostly, uh, listen to talk radio --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to keep up with, um, current events [NOISE] and maybe watch the news in the evenings.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I don't really get a lot of time to [NOISE], um, read the newspaper because I'm just real busy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, [NOISE] I do catch snippets [NOISE] on the internet and, um, [NOISE] uh, [NOISE] you know, l- listen on the radio.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Well, uh, I would say my primary source for n- current events is on the internet in the morning.  It --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, in -- I -- I log on to check my email then I read the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, headlines and see what, uh, see what's going on.  And then, um, [SIGH] in the after, uh, I would say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then in the evening, yeah, I would tune into the local news too. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'll also turn it -- to -- through the -- to the newspaper sometimes but only on weekends 'cause that's, like you said, that's probably the only time you have to read it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  Um, and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- radio too.  Yeah, I guess when I'm driving around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm out here in LA so we -- we do a lot of driving and, uh --
L:  Okay.
L:  I'm always sitting in my car and, um, I guess I tune into the news every so often.  But it's really repetitive because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they have all, you know, we have all news station too and -- and they just repeat the same thing after like, you know, ten minutes and so I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just tune into that for that one drive and then don't listen any more.
L:  Right.
R:  I kind of pop in and out.
L:  Uh, do you ever listen to talk radio or talks about current events?
R:  Uh, n- --
L:  'Cause that's really neat.
R:  Uh, yeah, my boyfriend listens to talk radio much more than I do.  I never really got into it.  I just kinda wanna hear the news and then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, kinda go about my day, I guess.  What --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What's the attraction for you?
L:  Um, well, I -- I -- I guess, um, [LIPSMACK] other than just hearing the news like as a report I just like to hear, you know, just the opposing sides of -- of -- of the issues and --
R:  The pros and cons?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, because then it -- it ki- -- it -- it helps me to have an opinion on something I really might not have a lot of knowledge about.
R:  I see, so you wanna hear what other people are thinking to help you form your own opinion?
L:  Well, n- not only that.  I mean, there are some things that I already have an opinion about but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I think I'm open minded enough where, I mean, it's not like it's only my opinion and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's all.  You know, I -- I -- I just like to hear how other people's minds work and, you know, how they might've come up with that opinion or --
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, kinda, you know, kinda see their view on a certain event.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um, you know, and how -- how they relate to it.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that -- and that's good.  That -- that's good that you're open to -- to other points of view.  Um, I remember --
L:  Not that I'm gonna change my mind. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] oh, you're not gonna change your mind. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do you find   See now -- now that's something that -- you bring up a interesting point because, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, with -- with all sorts of things that happen every day, uh, I -- I -- I -- uh, well actually that's -- I'm starting off the wrong foot there.  I guess what I'm trying to say is I find that most people already kinda have, you know, their opinion.  Okay, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The world is round, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, but then if you have some information that contradicts that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- somehow --
L:  Mhm.
R:  People c- will -- will -- maybe they'll kind of listen but for the most --
L:  Right.
R:  -- part it's very difficult, it seems, to change another person's opinion I've found.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, even if let's say for some re- -- you know, somehow the world really is flat; it's very --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- difficult to get people to see that. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, uh, that's been my experience and so it makes me think, "Well, okay, um, you know, are you guilty of the same thing, you know?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, um 
L:  Well, I think on certain issues, um, y- you know that are, you know, hape- happening currently, you know, the- there might be some moral factors involved that, you know, something that I would not stray from my viewpoint on.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, but if it's, you know   I don't know.  I- i- if -- e- every -- if I don't feel like, um, uh, [LIPSMACK] uh, going against, you know, a personal belief or something, or it's something that just doesn't go with my religion, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, you know, I'm -- I'm will- -- I -- I'd like to see it from -- fr- from the other point of view.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  [SIGH] W- --
L:  You know, just to see how, you know, how -- how they came to that opinion and --
R:  Do you feel that one source is more trustworthy or reliable, or more accurate than another source?  You know, say television versus the internet versus radio.
L:  No.  No, um, I mean, for a while there of course, you know, I was getting most of my knowledge about current events, you know, everybody was tuning into CNN or Fox News or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, CNBC, you know, on the television and then I just, you know, especially with the war.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, you know, you know, so I think maybe for a period of time I was more looking at the TV --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- for -- for -- for news and then I would supplement that with a lot of the talk radio news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then now that things kind of have calmed down a little bit, um, I think I really haven't looked that much on television.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it's the more -- you know, just catching it when I'm, you know, riding home.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and maybe like ten o'clock news.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, before I go to bed.  Just to kind of feel like you're up on all the local stuff, you know, along with world stuff. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, I -- I -- I find myself turning to the television too for breaking news.
L:  Uh, yes, exactly.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  With the -- with -- with, uh, internet or newspapers there's delay in that somebody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- has to write up the story first.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Uh, but that can be good in a way because you don't nece- -- you can't necessarily --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interpret events properly as they're happening.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I -- I find that kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interesting too.  It's like, okay, you know, we're getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the instant information but we're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not necessarily getting it within --
L:  Getting the right --
R:  -- a proper context.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  So, even though -- maybe that breaking news thing is great so that people +instantaneousl- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- instantaneously [NOISE] know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It just kind of gets dangerous if people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- speculate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in that first moment.
R:  Yeah, which I've seen reporters do all the time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause they're trying to fill air time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so   Well, pros and cons.  Pros and cons.  Um, so that wasn't a very meaty topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  I [LAUGH] -- I know I -- I'm trying to, uh, and -- and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's so funny because, uh, I guess I feel like, uh, um, kinda lacking not so far as far as news, you know, I wish, you know, I wish I did, you know, really dive into it more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because, you know, there are a lot of things in the world that are going on and, um, you know, you just wanna make sure that you know the facts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and unfortunately, you know, I know that with newspaper it's kinda hard to get the whole facts of the whole issue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, and that, you know, however long that article is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  W- --
L:  -- you have to catch it in the newspaper and then maybe you might see something on the internet and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you kinda have to piece it together.
R:  Well, what's great about the internet is that you're not limited to one news source.  You know, you're not limited to say the local paper, right?  
L:  Right.
R:  You can -- you can go and read about it from, you know, the British -- a British newspaper or -- or a Canadian newspaper --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And that's what's really neat to me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because, you know, different medias are -- are slanted perhaps a certain way or have certain biases and --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- it's neat to see and it's really fascinating for me to see -- to read international media 'cause, you know, they're looking at it from another point of view and so the -- that -- that's -- that's a great way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- look at another --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- topic going on.  So --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I hear children in the background.
L:  Yes, [LAUGH] we just got home from school.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, I'm actually in, uh, Nashville.
R:  Oh, okay.  Wow, you're far away. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  But, um, I -- I also like to go on the internet to read the news from the area that, uh, I grew up in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, 'cause I know that you brought up that point of, you know, with the internet you can access news worldwide.  Like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- newspapers around the country and [NOISE] you -- you know, read articles on line.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so I -- I like to keep up on [NOISE], um, I like to keep on, uh, you know the things going on in m
