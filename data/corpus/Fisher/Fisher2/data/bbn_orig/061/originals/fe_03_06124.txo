R:  Hello, I'm Laura.
L:  Hi, Laura.  This is Annie.
R:  Hi.  So, we gotta figure out how we keep up with our current events.
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well de- [LAUGH] -- definitely.  Usually I listen to talk radio in the morning and then, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I- in the evening I watch the CBS evening news.
R:  Mm. [SIGH] 
L:  And, of course, all day --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- long during the day I turn on CNN or Fox.  So, uh, basically I try to keep informed throughout the day --
R:  [NOISE]
L: You know, b- -- about what's happening in the world.
R:  Yeah, you're doing better than me.  I have small kids so I don't get m- [LAUGH] -- much --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- opportunities to watch the T- -- the news but I do.  I am on the internet a lot so, um, you know, it's easy for me to -- to pop over and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, ch- check the same -- uh, CNN -- the -- the website -- CNN website.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't get a ch- chance to do that too much.  So, it's just, uh, flipping through the channels in the evening. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I used to have, um -- I used to sign up for CNN, you know, during -- like on the computer too and a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- newsflash would come across the screen but I don't know it didn't work very well so I just kinda dropped it.
R:  Yeah, no.  Sometimes hard to download the, uh, al- -- you know, the, uh, uh, videos --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you can play over the internet.  Sometimes that's hard to do.  It doesn't always work but --
L:  Sure.
R:  You can usually just read, you know, the same articles that they have on their television show.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  On line just like you, you know, read a paper or whatever.  But my husband gets a chance to read it more than I do so he -- he keeps me --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Keeps me informed 'cause I'm pretty busy with the kids and --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  Well, don't have a lot of free time.  But, uh --
L:  Sure --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, u- usually like, you know, I s- -- um, actually, uh, I have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kids that are older so [LAUGH] you kn- -- but I'm not that old yet. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Not that old.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  And, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They're grown up and gone and, uh, so -- but I can understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, with little ones how --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it would be hard for you to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, especially if Mr Rogers is on or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, or Barney or whatever, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Well, plus [NOISE] sometimes the content, you know, isn't something that, you know --
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  -- necessarily I want, you know [NOISE] -- you know, my -- my little ones to watch.  But, uh, [NOISE] --
L:  Sure.
R:  I don't, uh, find our local paper has very good news coverage.
L:  No, we don't -- in fact we cancelled our paper.  The only paper that we get is on Sunday and, um, I had to laugh because my sister called me the other night.  She said there was a shooting in my neighborhood.  Somebody was taking pot shots with a gun.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, this is a very low key -- very family oriented neighborhood and, um, we have a lot of gangs --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- starting to move in the area.  So, it's -- it was a big thing.  It's gonna be on the news --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from what I understand but it'll also be on the internet.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  But I heard it first from my sister. [LAUGH] So 
R:  Yeah, 'cause she --
L:  Yeah, she's like a local newspaper but, um, you know, that's -- this is how we keep up current, you know.
R:  Yeah, no I -- I can relate to that.
L:  L- local.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you find out through the grapevine --
L:  Sh- w- --
R:  -- a lot of times.
L:  Well, I -- when I got that call at midnight I thought, "Who the heck?" [LAUGH] You know, you always think the worst.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I said, "Last time I got a call at midnight it was not good".  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- I said, "Don't do that to me".  But, uh --
R:  Yeah, most of the local things I hear are, you know, from word of mouth I don't -- I don't read 'em in the paper.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, there was a death o- of a gentleman our -- in our neighborhood through a heart attack and I find out through --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- the neighbors.  Not through, you know, y- his, uh, [NOISE] you know, right up in the paper.
L:  Sure.  Well, this is a low key community.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we've been getting, um, like --
R:  [inaudible] the shock, huh? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we're like five hundred to eight hundred miles away from like New York City.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And everybody's -- because it's such a nice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- community and we have a lot here of, uh -- and there are a lot of families here everybody's --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- moving down, you know, to -- to the area --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's made [NOISE] the area start to be unsafe.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, we -- like tonight the City Council meeting is on and I -- I usually watch that and, uh, for information --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, too and that's on like Cable television.  So, I don't know.  I think the TV and the -- and the, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- radio during the day for me and sometimes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the evening are the places that I get the most information.
R:  Yeah, I do enj- -- we have a -- you know, a talk radio in the afternoons and sometimes when I'm driving I -- I will [NOISE], you know, it -- but it's more local.  What's going on with the local politics and that sort of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, most every- --
L:  That's how our -- that's how our morning show is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But when I hear that rush --
R:  Most everything else I, you know, find out, you know, through the website or, you know, through my husband who reads the website --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and keeps up on it.  When we lived in Europe for -- for a while and -- and, you know, we didn't always get a lot of the -- as -- as much, uh, [NOISE] US news so [NOISE] we -- we got in the habit of looking at the CNN website.
L:  Oh, did you?  Yeah, sure.  Well, I always check the UK websites for news -- for daily news because, uh, we have friends and relatives over there in -- in Italy and a couple of other places too and then we have friends in the military.  So, it's a good place to get, you know, local news if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you wanna know about certain places.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think the national news is like basically on all day long.
R:  Yeah.
L:  On -- on the, uh --
R:  [COUGH] [NOISE]
L:  You know, on the TV.  So, you could go from one station to another, to another and find the same thing. [LAUGH] You know.  As far as news goes.
R:  Yes, it's just repeated [SIGH] --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- over and over and over and over again.
L:  Sure.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And --
R:  Sometimes the -- there's the same thing every hour on the hour.
L:  Well, th- yeah, that's the thing and, uh, um, they j- -- you know, the reporters just go on and on and even the, uh, uh, the talk shows on the news station --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are like Neil Kavoodo[?] and all those people.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um --
R:  That sounds like a New Yorker. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Neil Kavoodo.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I mean, they just keep, you know, repeating over and over, you know, again.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's happening or -- or, uh, Greta Van Susteren, you know.  You know, I [inaudible] Greta and I like her but, uh, you could only take so much of all that stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, you know, I -- I really try to keep up on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the news events, you know, that do happen in the community but I'm -- I'm a big fan of, you know, national news too.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But it kind of gets to you and --
R:  Yeah, some -- sometimes I feel like they, um, hype it up a lot.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you don't -- y- you know, the story seems a lot worse or you don't feel like you're getting the true story 'cause it's so hyped up and [NOISE] --
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, I stay here and, you know, I watch that, uh, I've been following that Laci Peterson case and I think it's just terrible.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, of course I shout out my opinions, [LAUGH] you know, that aren't always that good, you know, and, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  But, uh, not only that but with the, uh, you know, war in Iraq and I have cousins in the military --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that trained a lot of these --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- men and women to go over there and they were getting deployed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- themselves.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, i- it's, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You keep up on that and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then my husband was in the military for years and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, my husband was in for four or five years as well.
L:  Was he?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, it's -- it's something, you know.  And, uh, I --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I -- I wasn't real happy that we were going back over there.
R:  Mm.
L:  Of course I'm an old hippie but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I don't know.  The -- I -- I still don't see any weapons of mass destruction.  I'm waiting for them to show us some. [LAUGH] And, um --
R:  Yeah, it may take a h- -- a long time for it all to come out, you know.
L:  Well, I learned, you know, tha- -- you have to respect our President.  But when I see him on the news sometimes with that smirk on his face like I -- I feel like giving --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- him a good swift kick. [LAUGH] and saying, "Look, you know, everything that you've t- -- been telling us, you and Tony Blair have been telling us; where are these things?  You know?" 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, the thing that --
R:  We're not on a need to know basis. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, ri- -- y- -- right, right.
R:  I think -- I think there's a lot of things we don't know and we never will know, you know --
L:  Sure.
R:  Because they don't -- they d- -- they don't tell the public everything and they don't want us to freak out.  So, who knows, you know, what -- what they really have or haven't found?
L:  Well, the thing -- the thing that bothers me, I think, the most is that it's our people that are getting hurt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, over there.  So, when I hear that on the news, you know, it's like, "I would like to send Bush over there". [LAUGH] You know.  It -- it --
R:  I thought they were starting to send some of our troops home, or --
L:  Uh, they are but they're sending s-, uh, more over like to keep the peace.  Apparently from -- from the news reports the other --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- night the Taliban is back in, uh --
R:  Ugh.
L:  -- business along with the Al Qaeda.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, I thought, "Oh, here we go again". 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And, uh, you don't know what to think because you hear about, you know, we're still not safe because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the terrorists.
R:  See part of that I wonder if it's just not just the media hyping it up, you know, a little bit, you know.
L:  Right, sure.
R:  I think that the media probably makes it, you know, "Are you -- are your, you know, family safe overseas?"  And, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  And, "The Al Qaeda strikes again".  You know, and yeah, it gets you hooked and --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  But, you know, I think that, um, [NOISE] --
L:  Well, I th- -- I think the news today too is more fear.  I- it puts fear --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- into people.
R:  It's like a movie.  They're trying to make it like a movie, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Action packed news. [LAUGH]
L:  Sure, sure.  And then I was riveted to the TV when they had those shootings down --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, outside of Washington.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um
