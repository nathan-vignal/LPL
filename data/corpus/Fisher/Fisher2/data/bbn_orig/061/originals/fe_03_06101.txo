L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Alicia.
R:  Hi, Alicia.  My name is Gyler.  How are you?
L:  Fine.  And you?
R:  I'm just fine.
L:  Good.
R:  So, how do you receive all of your current event information?
L:  Mostly off the internet.
R:  Do you like to -- I like to peruse it first thing in the morning but about after that it just kind of word of mouth through work and -- and that sort of thing.
L:  Yeah, same with me.
R:  What area of the country are you in?
L:  Uh, Oklahoma.
R:  Oh, you're not too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- far from me.  I'm from Kansas.
L:  [NOISE] Where at in Kansas? [NOISE]
R:  Uh, Pittsburgh, south east corner.
L:  Oh, I live in --
R:  So --
L:  -- Woodward in North West Oklahoma.
R:  Okay.  That's a ways.  My husband's from, uh, Grove, Oklahoma.  So, we are in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Oklahoma quite a bit but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not -- not quite that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- far.  But, uh, yeah, uh, the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of the information in the [NOISE] paper lately in our area has been about the tornados.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- did you have tornado weather where you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- are?
L:  No, it was mainly in Oklahoma City area.
R:  Uh-huh.  How close to you -- to Oklahoma --
L:  [SIGH] Abo- --
R:  -- are you?
L:  About two and a half hours away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  -- didn't come near us.
R:  Yeah, we had a couple of small towns that were completely destroyed.  Uh, even destroying the school systems and such and so the kids were quite pleased with that because they didn't have to go back to school and about every day in paper they have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at least a page or -- or two regarding the different things that have been happening with these towns and the clean effort up.  Ef- efforts --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  We have a small d- daily paper and it just doesn't [NOISE] carry a lot of stuff.  I mean --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- it thinks it does but it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nothing that really pertains to the -- the town that much.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
L:  And --
R:  So, what size town do you live in?
L:  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] Um, it's got about twelve thousand people but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  For some reason the -- the paper just doesn't carry a lot of news.
R:  Mhm.  We get a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- AP stuff.
L:  Yeah, we do too.
R:  Yeah.  But, uh, and we've got a pretty good group of reporters here and they do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- an awful lot of -- of hometown stuff.  They do a lot of +accreditation[?].  Uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's something in our paper --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- once a week that -- about good stuff that happens and bad stuff that happens in town and it's kind of interesting because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of times you see stuff about benefits or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or the health --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of a neighbour --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff that they think is the wrong thing that's happening and they'll put those blurbs --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in there too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Anyway, and there's -- there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We're -- we're a community of I would say seventeen to twenty thousand because we have a university here.  So, I think the news coverage helps with the university in town because we're looked at a little bit more under scrutiny and such.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh, but in the summer town[?] our -- our population, um, you know, of course drops because summer school doesn't bring as many people in and -- and they do a lot more festivals and that sort of stuff of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coverage.  We have a, uh, something called Little Balkans Days that is associated with our town at Labor Day and so we have a whole lot of coverage and in fact they've even -- even though it's before Memorial Day they've even had blurbs in there about what's gonna be happening because it's such a widely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- known event that it brings in about twenty five to thirty thousand people for that weekend.  So, there's been a lot of coverage regarding that already.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, um, our town -- our newspaper doesn't have a -- carry really a lot of local news.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mainly AP stuff.
R:  Do you -- do you end up buying other papers or do you just --
L:  Um, yeah --
R:  -- subscribe to that one, or ?
L:  [SIGH] No, I don't even subscribe to that one.  I read it occasionally at work and that's about it but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, I will get the, uh, The Daily Oklahoma which is the -- the big p- -- big state paper out of Oklahoma City --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And read it and then [inaudible] Oklahoma and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And catch up on the news that way.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm like right between what would be considered Tulsa, um, about two hours from it as well as from Kansas City Missouri and those are two pretty big papers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they carry those in the news racks here.  But -- and we've got the TV stations going.  Unfortunately we shouldn't, but we've got like five TVs in our house --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- depending on which room we're in and we usually have a station going at one time, especially when the war first broke out.  My husband's brother is stationed over there and it seemed like he was -- my husband was just attached to the TV and now that things -- there's not quite as much fighting going on he hasn't, you know, watched it.  It just seemed like at first all he was doing is telling me facts all the time and it got to the point to where I just wanted to be away from it, uh, because it was just an awful lot of information to absorb and -- and such but -- anyway, I, uh, [LIPSMACK] I usually take our newspaper that we get locally and just scan the headlines and if it looks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interesting I'll -- I will, you know, read the whole article but a lot of other times too I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take care of a daycare so I don't -- I have a limited amount of time in the mornings and, uh, in the evenings by the time my own kids are home it's -- it's fascinating though in school how much lately they've been covering the local events because I have kids from ten to sixteen and they'll come home and tell me stuff, you know, about the events that has happened that I have, you know, I find really interesting or I don't even know about yet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, anyway, the media's all over the place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The day and age of -- of computers.  It doesn't take you too long if you just wanna go ahead and -- and key on to find out the newest war stuff 'cause they [NOISE] get it on it pretty, you know, instantaneous.  So --
L:  Yeah, I check -- I usually check the, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- internet more than anything 'cause I work nights and so I sleep during the day and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then when I get up, you know, I -- I tend to check it and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff and -- and read the headlines and if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's something I like -- if something that interests me then I'll read the whole article but --
R:  Do you talk much with anybody at work about stuff like this?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, not a lot but sometimes we'll -- you know, if sometimes interesting happens --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, we'll talk about it but --
R:  I have a tough job 'cause I've got like two to four year olds in my daycare so it's kind of a tough job to talk about the news with them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're more interested in who has what toy and what they want.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I work at an emergency room so, you know, we don't always have a lot of t- chance --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to -- to talk but --
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I guess you know the local news if there's a disaster or anything before anybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- else and what the impact is of it then.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I, um, I had started school and then had a -- had to take care of a family member instead but I started school to be a Surg Tech and I'm still interested in that and so, um   In the emergency room -- are you a nurse in the emergency room or a clerk or ?
L:  I'm a clerk.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I register them as they come in, so --
R:  Mhm.  That's got to be kind of a -- an anxious type of a job.  I envy you. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  People are always so panicked at that point in time that they just wanna be seen.  That's -- that's gotta be stressful on you.  
L:  Well, in -- not really because this is a, you know, a small town in a small area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's -- it's more of a, you know, they're -- they have colds that they've had for three weeks and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's two o'clock in the morning so they have to be seen now and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and things like that.  So, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's just little things usually.
R:  I've been in it a couple of times and both times my experience with my kids hasn't been very favorable because the clerk was usually taking the wrath of somebody. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So 
L:  That doesn't happen that often. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That makes you wanna go to your job better.  So, well, this is one of those subjects that, you know, you can only talk about so much. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it is.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You kinda have to stretch out the ten minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, really.  How did you find out about the surveys --
L:  Um --
R:  -- that they were doing?
L:  I'm on a, um, refunding chat board --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and --
R:  That's how I found out about mine.
L:  From Refunding Makes Sense?
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  From Jeanette in Minnesota?
R:  From Jeanette in Minnesota.
L:  Yeah?
R:  That's right.  In fact I just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- got off of -- that's hilarious.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's really funny.
L:  [LAUGH] It's a small world. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes it is.  Let me tell you what.  Penn State is gonna -- when they listen to these calls and -- and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- such they're really -- they're gonna be hearing about Refunding Makes Sense a lot.
L:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH]
R:  That's really funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's really funny. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you post very much --
L:  Not a lot.
R:  -- to the board?
L:  Not a lot.
R:  Yeah.  I tell you --
L:  Every once in a while but --
R:  I have made back so much money off of this board.
L:  Oh, I did too.  I just --
R:  I just love it.
L:  I just started last year and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you know my mom was, you know, saying, "Oh, you shouldn't have spent the twenty five dollars", and everything and -- but then she turned real happy because the Ford Visa Card come in and -- and you know I had her do it and my dad do it and my brother do it.  His girlfriend did it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I did it and -- and, you know, she's like, "Hey, that's pretty good, well [LAUGH] --"
R:  Isn't it great?
L:  "-- that's a pretty good hobby".  Yeah.
R:  Isn't it great?  Well, when --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they had those, uh, they made a blurb about the stockpots that Lennons[?] and things had.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I ordered a whole bunch of sets of those so I could put into a flea market booth that we were just starting.  They came with a ten dollar rebate.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And I paid seven for 'em and I sent 'em in just hoping that I would get all of them and not just w-
