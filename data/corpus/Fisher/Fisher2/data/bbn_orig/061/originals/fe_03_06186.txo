R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  My --
L:  Hi, my name's Lisa, I'm in Arizona.
R:  And my name is Eunice and I live in Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay, uh-huh.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  How are you doing?
R:  I'm just fine.
L:  Okay.
R:  And now we're gonna talk current events and they've --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- picked the wrong one for this one.  Um --
L:  Well, how we get our news, huh?
R:  I usually -- [MN] a lotta the stuff I get, I get off the Internet, I read the Internet.  I don't really watch a lotta TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And occasionally I do read a newspaper but, you know, watching news on TV, I usually don't do that, I know most people do but I'm just not in that habit.  So that's how I do it, you know, I just read what's on the front page of MSN or something and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  I used to -- I -- I don't look at the TV news as much as I used to [COUGH], only because it just doesn't -- it seems trivial, what they report about now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's all the same. [LAUGH]
R:  Pretty much.
L:  I don't know how -- I don't know how old you are --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but, um, I'm like, in my early forties.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I remember it was like, um, Walter Cronkite and people who, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- serious journalists.  And now it's like they tell you really bad stuff and they smile and --
R:  Yeah, well [LAUGH] --
L:  -- you know, it's like, ugh! [LAUGH]
R:  I understand, yeah, I see where you're coming from, 'cause I'm in my forties also.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, I don't know, I was raised in a household where every night, you know, at ten o'clock you watched the news to ten thirty then it's bedtime, and then, you know, from six to six thirty.  But I don't know why I don't, I used to, uh, quite, oh, you know, several years ago, but I just c- -- it's like you just get outta the habit after the Internet came along, you know, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- spend most of my evenings doing the Internet thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the kids watch TV and then ten o'clock or ten thirty is bedtime for them, you know, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the cable, you know.
L:  I -- I -- I read the paper but not -- not every day.
R:  I don't either.
L:  But, um, yeah, I -- probably the -- the weekends is when it's most consistent.  But outside of that --
R:  I get the coupons outta the weekend paper.  It's, you know --
L:  Yeah!  But outside of that --
R:  I read the --
L:  Outside of that I'm like you.
R:  Actually, well, I usually just read like, the front page, and Anne Landers and the horoscopes and the back page 'cause that's where they usually have all the like, they have a column in there where people call in and bitch. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's always very inter- -- well, they do, it's very interesting I think, you know, 'cause that's like, local stuff and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they have a local newspaper which my mother gets, so that's why when I go to her house I read it, so that's -- but, uh, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I usually go through a whole Sunday paper.  It's like, okay, let me get caught up on everything that I [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]  [several inaudible words].
R:  You do?  Yeah.
L:  But usually I just -- I look at the Internet, it's -- it's -- I don't know, it's really easy but then I read papers from all over the country so that it doesn't seem like one particular view and -- and --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- also to kind of find out more about what's going on -- yeah, and I try and read like --
R:  So you subscribe --
L:  Sometimes Canadian or --
R:  -- to a whole bunch of 'em huh?
L:  Well, I don't subscribe but, you know, you just --
R:  You get on the --
L:  I mean, some of 'em you have to subscribe to but I just kind of --
R:  On the Net you do, you mean you just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- read all different -- yeah, well that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I don't do that.  You're much more informed than me, I just, you know, like what's on MSN or something particularly interests me, you know, I'll read it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I never know what it's going to be, it could be anything, and, uh, you know, I -- I do -- actually, see, I delivered --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- newspapers just not too long ago and now I'm just gonna -- uh, tonight is my first restarting doing this, but I deliver papers, but I hardly ever -- well, after you deliver 'em you're tired of 'em, you don't wanna look at any more, so I don't really --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- read one very much. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think I'd feel the same way.
R:  So, um, you know.
L:  Well then, you're up kinda late 'cause don't you do that like, really early?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, about two o'clock but that gives me --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, I get in bed pretty soon.  I had -- I was making brownies, that's why.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's like -- my little girl's nine, she lost a book.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She's looking for her library book 'cause school's almost out here, she's got like, mm, you know, couple a weeks left, next week they won't be doing anything but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they c- said she lost this book but I was sure she took it back, so we're looking for a book --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, so that's our current event at home! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  I don't know if we're gonna find it or not.  They want -- she said, "Well, you know, by the way, you have to pay twelve dollars".  I was like, "Okay, well, I --" she [inaudible] fourteen --
L:  Is she looking for a particular book?
R:  She had a book on cheerleading.
L:  Oh.
R:  She liked it.  But the book was really, you know, she likes stuff like that.  She's only nine so she's n- -- you know, she's not into it.  Of course they do have like, cheerleading camps and stuff that's like, for a day or two that she goes to, which I do send her in for those, you know, 'cause she's interested in stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, I don't know, she -- I n- -- I was pretty sure she took this back -- book back, so we're turning over everything we can.  She's going through her closet now, which is quite a thing to do. [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So -- better get back on subject, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.  Oh, let's see --
R:  I don't know, well, if I'm in the car or something or like and the news will come on the radio, you know, I try to listen.
L:  Yeah, I listen to NPR.
R:  Do ya?
L:  I like -- I like that.  They're pretty straightforward --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with their programs and stuff and that's pretty good.  Outside of that, you know, sometimes I listen to regular radio, um, news programs but NPR is pretty consistent, outside of that with the radio it's just music.
R:  I like to watch like, um, Sixty Minutes and stuff, do they consider that current events too? [LAUGH]
L:  I would think so.
R:  I like stuff like that, you know --
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  -- that's more [inaudible] as a news but it's still, you know -- you know, they have a lotta interesting things.
L:  Yeah, [MN] --
R:  You know, on there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I -- you know, stuff like that, so -- I don't know.  I guess I stay pretty well informed, I'm not too informed at all.  My kids don't -- they don't like news very much, I mean, they don't ever -- they just flip the station when the news comes on, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  That's young.  But --
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, my -- my eight year old niece, she's kind of, I don't know, I -- I -- I don't think she watches the news but she knows a lot about what's going on.
R:  And part of that's from school though, 'cause, you know, they cover, you know, they have current events at school where they cover every day.  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  She's developed a fascination --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for Martin Luther King.  I said, "What do you want to --"
R:  Has she really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.
L:  I said, "What do you want for your birthday?" 'cause she's just turned eight.  "Oh, I'd like a book of Martin Luther King".  I'm like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "Okay, just what everybody --"
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  "-- at eight year old wants!"  [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- that's cool.  That's something --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- good to want when you're eight.
L:  It really is.  It really is.
R:  Now, she studied that, they had, you know, Martin Luther King Day and she did -- they did a thing on it, you know, but she didn't get too interested in.  she's not really interested too much in anything like that, it's just more -- she's more like she wants to be the cheerleading kinda stuff like that, the stuff that she likes, you know.
L:  Well that's good, I mean, it's good to have something that you're involved in, yeah.
R:  Anything where she can jump around, she doesn't like to sit still too often, she's just really gotta be doing something, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that's --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- different kids, different str- -- this one does, I gotta lot of 'em and the different ones are always -- they're different.
L:  How many do you have?
R:  [MN] I have eight children but they're not all here, I have -- you know, I've been at this a long time.  My youngest one is nine my oldest one is thirty so --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- I have four left at home, so that's not, you know.  They're spread out so much, it's not like I had a whole bunch all at once, so --
L:  Oh my goodness!
R:  Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I got like, ten grandchildren, you know, and I'm only like forty something [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my Gosh!
R:  Yeah, but it's fun! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh okay, well let's see, we gotta get back on the news thing --
R:  Yes we do --
L:  -- 'cause that's what they asked us.
R:  -- we gotta get back to the news.
L:  Okay.  Well, I guess we both -- we both get our news pretty much from the Internet.
R:  Yes we do.
L:  Do you look at, um, like, your -- your homepage and -- and the news on that?
R:  Well, I use MSN as my homepage.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I start there, and I always, you know, whatever's on the front, you know -- and y- -- they have pretty much, you know, the mo- -- you know, pretty much current stuff that's in the headlines on that front page, you know, and if it's something that kinda interests me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or something, you know, I'll click on it and read more.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, it's like, oh, more or less like an article out of a newspaper.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so, uh, you know, 'cause they have a lot of fashion and things like that, you know, which I like stuff like that, you know, that's just typical.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  [NOISE] Well, don't worry about it, we'll keep looking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Go -- now go eat your brownie 'cause almost -- it's bedtime now, we're behind.  I'll look -- I'll look some more.  Well, we're still looking.  [inaudible].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Probably won't find it so I'll be out fourteen bucks for a book that I think sits in their library but [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-oh! [LAUGH]  Oh.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I usually start with, um, I have, uh, Yahoo.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I'll start with that and -- and then maybe, um, uh, Google and -- and see what's going on, just kind of basics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then kind of, you know, if something strikes me, kind of go further or --
R:  Well yeah, but you didn't -- it's -- the -- with the Internet, you know, you can go to just about anywhere and there'll be something there that's, you know, any --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- homepage or front page or anything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- if you can flip up something that might be, you know, it's like current events.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  It's been pretty interesting, uh, um, I think I delved more into it in the last, um, I guess in the last six to eight months to -- with the -- the world events and just seeing what was going --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, with the Middle East and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I- Iraq and everything and -- and then just, you know, see what other countries were, you know, what their slant was and just kind of, you know, maybe get a little different spin and see -- I don't know! [LAUGH]
R:  Well I w- -- I -- I don't know, I've followed a little bit of that, you know, but I did -- don't know what -- actually, my mother does a lot of, you know, she watches the news like, twice a day so I just call her up and say, "Hey, how's the war going?" [LAUGH] and she'll tell me all about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, she's my current event there, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, uh --
L:  I had to turn the TV off during that because it just got -- when they first started it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then it was like, twenty four hours a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Twenty four hours a day and it was like -- most of the time it was like nothing new, nothing the same, I'm like, "Why is this totally being televised?" and so I had to start turning the TV off, just basically off, most of the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it was -- it was just driving me crazy [LAUGH].
R:  I know, I [MN] -- yeah, that's true.  Yeah, they just kinda over cover things.  But I mean, you know, it's a big event, it's a big media event and people can lose their lives.  I understand all that too, you know, but I don't know, I'm just -- I don't -- I don't follow any n- -- you know, actually I don't follow any news that much, I guess I'm just not that -- I should be more interested in world events but I'm not, I don't [LAUGH] --
L:  I don't know.  I don't know whether it's --
R:  Some of it [MN] -- some of it I am and some of it I'm not.
L:  I don't know whether it's good to be -- I don't know whether it's good to be really informed or just like [LAUGH] --
R:  Something that actually, you know, if it's -- it's an event that's kinda actually affecting my life a whole lot, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, of course I guess what goes on over there affects everyone's life.  I did -- you know, I like articles, you know, like when they -- like, the one I've seen on MSN where they got in this palace over there and they -- the guys was writing, uh, "We were here" on the wall and stuff --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and -- and then they made 'em wash it all off and I thought, well why? [LAUGH]  Things like that, you know.
L:  Well I couldn't understand why they were writing on it anyway.  I don't know.  It's like, I understand that a lot of these guys are young and stuff but the purpose was to kind of go over there and -- and do
