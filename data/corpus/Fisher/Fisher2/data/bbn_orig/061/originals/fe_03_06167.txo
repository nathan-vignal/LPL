L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello?
R:  Hello?  I'm Brenda from north Carolina.
L:  Hey, I'm Bernice from Cleveland, Tennessee.
R:  Oh well, that's interesting.  Well, [SIGH] uh, how do you get your, uh, news?
L:  Well, I normally watch, um, I watch -- I normally watch CNN or Headline News.  [LIPSMACK] That's how I get, you know, the news from the world but and I also watch my local news too.  And I like to watch, uh, I can't remember what I even watch, you know, the trial coverage, have you ever watched that?
R:  Uh, Court TV?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, yes, I watch that some.
L:  I get a lot -- I, you know, I get a lotta stuff from there too.  I usually get it -- I get it from different sources, radio, TV.  How do you get yours?
R:  Well, uh, from TV a lot.  I like to watch the news.  Um, I used to have CNN but i- i- i- I'm really a news addict and, uh, I'm kinda glad I don't have CNN anymore.  But I watch the local news and the national news and these, uh, shows like Sixty Minutes and so on.  And, um --
L:  Oh, I love those shows.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  And I have a computer and I, uh, see news over the Internet, among other things I do with it and, uh, [LIPSMACK] I, uh, used to get the, uh, local paper, but since I -- I'm on the Internet now I just read the headlines over the Internet and --
L:  Yeah, that's what I do, 'cause you can --
R:  And then if I --
L:  -- get your paper over it.
R:  If it's really interesting I'll buy the paper.  But, uh, [SIGH] on Sundays I like to get a paper.  I get, uh, [LIPSMACK] uh, [SIGH] the paper here and then Charlotte paper and I -- I like to, uh, read the news and do the crossword puzzles and get the coupons and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I do.  I like to get the Sunday paper too.  But I sometimes -- I used to watch CNN a lot when I came home from work but I think they have a l- -- they have too much graphic things on there for me.  You know, some of the things they did, which, you know, some of it's depressing.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some of it I don't like to watch.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I do like to keep up with things though.
R:  That's right.  When, um, when all this, uh, the nine eleven was on [SIGH], you know, I'll just watch it -- it seems like +every few minutes I'd have to see what was going on.  See what the latest was.
L:  I know, that's what my daughter --
R:  And it --
L:  We did that too.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And we were glued to it.  It was just like, [MN] you know, you couldn't -- it was unbelievable.  Something like, you know, in a -- in a movie.  That you'd see in a movie, it was something I couldn't, uh --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- it just didn't seem real to me.
R:  Uh, uh, yes.  And the war coverage and, uh, oh, that was -- it must have been terrible for the families of the people that were there.
L:  Yeah, that was -- that wa- -- that was bad 'cause there were several -- there were several, uh, young -- young boys from here that -- that were killed, they were like, one was twenty one and one was twenty three.
R:  Yeah.  Oh.
L:  They were just babies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  And they were killed in that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in that war.
R:  That's right.  I don't listen to the radio anymore.  I think I probably would enjoy it but I just never seem to turn it on.  Do you ever listen to news on the radio? [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, well, when I have [MN] -- like, if I'm on the -- if I'm in the car or --
R:  Oh, in the car, yeah.
L:  -- sometimes if I'm playing house I'll have the radio on and they'll do like, you know, they'll do news like, ten after or, you know, whatever.  They'll just normally do the -- the main headlines of whatever is going on in town, you know?  I'll listen to it then, you know, when I'm cleaning my house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or maybe I'm in the car or, you know, when they -- when they say what the news is about.  But I basically don't turn it on for that.
R:  In other news you get from church groups and so on.  I'm in WMU and you found out, you know, [SIGH] what people are doing.  Usually it's [SIGH] -- the news is not good, you know, at my age [LAUGH] somebody's sick or ...
L:  Yeah, it's the news to me.  That's what my mother says 'cause she's -- she's, uh, she's seventy seven and she don't like to watch it because she says it depresses her.  So she won't --
R:  Mm.
L:  You can rarely get her to watch the news, 'cause she says it's always something depressing and, you know, she goes to church and -- and, uh -- but she just don't -- she just don't wanna watch it.  There's always something, she says, that makes her sad because she sees, you know, a lotta bad stuff going on in the world, and there is.
R:  Yeah, it's [SIGH] -- usually it's, uh, who killed who in Charlotte and all this stuff.
L:  Oh, is that where you're from?
R:  I'm from close to Charlotte, yeah.
L:  Yeah, because I've --
R:  I'm, uh --
L:  -- I've been to -- I've been to -- my sister used to live in Greensborough and then -- I've been in north Carolina quite a few times.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the town we live in, it's small, we only have like, thirty thousand people here.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  So, you know, it's pretty small and pretty close knit and, you know, it's just things here, you know you can -- really wouldn't have to, you know, read it in the paper or anything 'cause the town's so small.
R:  Yeah, I hear you.
L:  But that's why she don't read it because she don't like to watch the news 'cause it's so depressing and now, uh, nowadays it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's just a lotta stuff about, you know, little children getting killed and their parents, you know, killing 'em and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff like that.  But, you know, I like to keep up with what's going on in the world as far as the president and everything's concerned.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and the economy.
R:  That's true.  Well, um, also you hear about what's going on in the community by talking to people on the phone.
L:  Yeah, you can, you sure can.  And [inaudible] you know that you can do that especially if you live in a small town 'cause that's basically where I live, is a small town.  And --
R:  And older people seem -- my mother, you know, seems to talk on the phone an awful lot, you know.  If you don't have a job and ... uh, [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, that's what my mother does.  She's -- she's on the phone quite a bit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause she just g- rarely gets out, she just goes to church and then she's, you know, she's on the phone.  She'll -- she'll watch a little TV but she don't like -- she don't like the news.  You know, if I -- I'm usually the one that tells her anything about what's going on with the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- economy and things like that, you know, she likes to know about the self security and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, stuff like that, which I do too.
R:  [SIGH] And you hear about, uh, [SIGH] things that are going on, uh, from children, you know?  It's good to, uh, know some children or you wouldn't know what -- what they're doing and what's new and what's the latest music and, u- uh, movies and so on. [SIGH]
L:  Now you can find out quite a bit from children and my -- my great nephew, you know, he can -- I could find out quite a bit from him 'cause he -- he keeps up with the TV, you know, and he could lay -- he likes to watch some things in the news and things whilst he's on his computer and -- and I read quite a bit off of there too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I'm on there.  I try to, you know, get on the news channel.  Not -- nothing -- well, we get like our network channels.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you know, our local channels, you can just pull them up and you can read everything they've done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you missed it on TV you can just read it.  So if I missed it and sometimes I wanna know, I'll just get on there and I'll look it up on there.
R:  And I'm a reading addict too, you know, I just [SIGH] -- it seems like I have to be reading something.  I have something going just, uh, every day.  I don't read the whole day but, you know, I -- I read magazines and ...
L:  Yeah, there's quite in there.  Now there's quite a bit of stories in -- in some of the magazines --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that y'all read.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's quite a bit of, you know, quite a bit of stuff in there -- in -- in there's, you'll find.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I like to keep up with the news myself, I always have.
R:  And it helps, news.  I mean, you find a lot of things that are useful.
L:  Yeah, you do.
R:  In magazines and --
L:  Especially research and health and everything.  My daughter has heard disease and, uh, I found that quite a -- on quite a few of the news channels, like you can find out new -- new things about heart disease that they're gonna do.  You know, the new studies and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, new things that they can come out with, 'cause she's only thirty four.
R:  Oh goodness.
L:  And, uh, she has heart disease and I like to keep up with the -- with that.  'Cause they do a lotta medical news on our local channels here and I like to watch that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To see, you know, what the --
R:  That is good.
L:  -- the new technology is gonna be for health, uh, you know as far as her or anybody.
R:  Right.
L:  It's good to watch that for that.  Because you can find out a lot on the Internet too.
R:  Oh, you do.
L:  And I hadn't --
R:  You do?
L:  -- had my -- I hadn't had my computer but about two years but, I tell you what, it's -- they're -- they're handy to have.  I mean, they're useful, they're useful tools.
R:  They are.
L:  You can use them in either way, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It can either be for bad or good.
R:  Uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, it just walked in, he's going, "Yes".
L:  Yep.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] well, by reading, uh, [SIGH] stories and newspapers and magazines, you find out how other people deal with problems that they have.
L:  Yeah, you do.
R:  And, uh, [SIGH] that helps you sometimes.  I- it does
