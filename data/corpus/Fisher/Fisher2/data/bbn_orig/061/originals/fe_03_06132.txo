R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, this is Martha and I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh, this is Deana and I'm in ... South Carolina.
L:  Not too far away, practically neighbors.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, it's on current events we're talking.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, well I watch ... n- not too much TV.  Um, I tend to get a lot of my information [SIGH] on the drive to work in the morning on the news --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- on the radio.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And, um, in the newspaper.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I, ah, [SIGH] hear the -- the clock radio in the morning [SIGH] and then I read the newspaper, but then I spend a lot of my time [SIGH] ah, at -- I'm a stay at home grandma.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  [SIGH]  So, I have [SIGH] children that I babysit off and on.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so I spend a lot of time on the Internet.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, you get -- so you go on to the like the, um, [MN] news station --
L:  Right, --
R:  -- site?
L:  -- like, ah, Net- -- ah, Netscape and Yahoo and things like that.  So, ...
R:  Oh, yeah, sometimes when I go on to the Internet when I see, um, [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like on -- on Yahoo the little blurbs on the side --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, they catch my interest.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes, they do.  [SIGH]
R:  'Cause, yeah, they're, [NOISE] like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to the point and there, like, the most current.  And [SIGH] I do enjoy the -- you know, t- that because it's easy, you know, it's short little stories [SIGH] that --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, the -- the radio and the Internet sort of [SIGH] make the newspapers seem l- late by the time you read it.  [SIGH]
R:  Right, because by then it's -- it's already like a day or two old.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, yeah.  So, do you watch -- do you watch a lot of the -- you don't watch so much TV ... for the news?
L:  Well, we do watch the news, usually at dinnertime.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  We, [LIPSMACK] -- we're a retired couple, semi retired.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We -- we both work occasionally but [SIGH] we, ah, often [SIGH] sit, ah, our TV trays out and watch the -- the bad news at -- at [LAUGH] dinnertime.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I find it very depressing sometimes to watch the news.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -It's easier just to read it in print and [SIGH] -- or just to hear the -- you know, in t- the morning on the radio, just to hear what -- the latest updates.  And [SIGH] it kind of gives the -- [LAUGH] the -- you know, the summary of ... what's +important that's out there.  [LAUGH]
L:  And the radio gives me a lot of really local stuff sometimes.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, what's happening this weekend here [SIGH] that I wouldn't know otherwise.  And ... then, of course, there's the local section in the newspaper, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] which also tells me local events that I certainly can't find on Yahoo because [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- they're not going to report them.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I agree.  I -- I like to -- [SIGH] yeah, I -- I prefer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if I had -- if I read the newspaper and I'm, you know, short on time [SIGH] I'll usually read the local section first.
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  And then if I, you know, have extra time I'll go into the, [SIGH] you know, the main section.  But I find t- the main ... section just has so much information that I -- I really am just not interested in.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know, you're going to find out -- if you don't find out what happened in Iraq today you'll find out tomorrow.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's always in -- on the news in the morning, --
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] the latest what's going on.
L:  Yep.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And on the way to work do you listen to PRN?  Do you listen to ...?  [SIGH]
R:  No, I -- I usually just listen you know, [LAUGH] I -- I  usually just listen to [LAUGH] whatever, um, you know -- like, ah, [SIGH] -- it's, like, just the regular radio station with, you know, talk radio.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And you know, [SIGH] most of it's actually the old -- it's the oldie station that I listen to.  [SIGH]  And then they have the um, [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] the news you know, like every half hour.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't listen to, you know, NPR or anything like that.
L:  Yeah, you know, you can't listen to -- you know, an hour of that stuff on the way to work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  How long -- how long a commute do you have?
R:  It's only about -- t- thirty minutes.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I -- I you know, when I get in the car I usually, you know, get the -- it's usually when the news is coming on, so I get the news and [SIGH] [NOISE] that's about it.  So, um, you know, I [SIGH] -- and then it's -- usually, you know, it's like ... a minute worth of news but they -- 
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- it's, you know, it's packed with information.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, um, [SIGH] and that's -- that's all -- I mean it catches me up to date and if not, you know, if I hear something [SIGH] you know, during the work day someone will, you know, fill me in then.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They'll let me know what is going on.  [SIGH]
L:  And then on the way home you get the same thing.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it -- usually on the way home it's just if there's a ... major change in something.
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause in the mornings they usually, you know, give you the [SIGH] -- the news from the day before whatever had happened --
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but on the way home it's ... more just -- if there's, you know, a big news story and usually that's the traffic time.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]  That's like every fifteen minutes, ten minutes they tell you the traffic.  So, ...
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Yep, when we're driving we really need to hear about the traffic.
R:  Yeah, it's ... traffic and weather.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm just off of R Ninety Five.
R:  Oh!
L:  And, ah, [LAUGH] if it gets [SIGH] locked up in one direction or another then I really need to hear s- some -- some up to date current news.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause -- you know, 'cause especially -- I -- I'm from South Florida so it would get crazy down there --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- with the -- with the -- you know, you'd have to know ... exactly, you know, [SIGH] if you can get -- if you are caught and you know, if there's a [SIGH] tie up somewhere and you get caught --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you're sitting in traffic for, like, two hours.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, easy, yeah.
R:  Here -- here the traffic, um, I'm in Charleston [SIGH] ye- --
L:  Oh, I lived in Charleston.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, my husband was in the Navy, submarines.
R:  Oh!  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  And we lived at Goose Creek for two years.
R:  Oh, really?

R:  Oh, wow!
L:  On- -- one of the last babies born in the old Navy hospital.  [LAUGH]

R:  Yeah, I'm actually, um, where I am I'm in a new area -- I'm in we- -- west of the Ashley.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, --
L:  We lived in Chatmoss ... once.
R:  You're kidding me?
L:  No.  We --
R:  Oh, I'm -- I'm -- well I'm in a new development right after Chatmoss.
L:  Ah, where the swamps were?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yes.  It --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yes.  [LAUGH]  This development it's now -- the development's about five years old I think.

L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- Highway sixty one -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  We were in Chatmoss f- four years.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah, that was after the children were a little older.  We came back to Charleston.
R:  Yes, Chatmoss is, ah, -- right next door to us and then you know, that comes off and then you go down a little bit [SIGH] and it's Somerville and there's actually houses down there.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Wow!  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do they still run into ... d- deer on the road to Somerville at night?
R:  Yeah, they're --
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- are still deer here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's, um, [MN] -- yeah, there's deer in our neighborhood here sometimes [SIGH] and, [SIGH] um, boar -- wild boar.
L:  Oh, goodness!
R:  Yeah and --
L:  I would have thought that would have all been gone by now.
R:  No, they're -- they're still here.  Yeah.
L:  Are they building more bridges?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, they're actually -- the, um, [MN] the Scary[?] Bridge from Mount Pleasant--
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There's the -- there's the original one; --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then there's the new one --

L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  So, there's another new one being built.
L:  Oh, finally.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you won't have to go all the way up to the Abbey and turn around and come across --
R:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, there -- yeah, the br- -- the bridges are [SIGH] -- yeah, right now, yeah, it's pretty good with the bridges.  They're [SIGH] pretty, um, ... there's -- there's a lot of bridges you don't have to like -- you know, do turn arounds --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- unless there's a problem that way, you know, [SIGH] on one of the bridges and then you know, [SIGH] [LAUGH] forget it!  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, see you're giving me n- news about the area that I didn't get from the Internet and the newspapers, and the television.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and it's [LAUGH] -- [SIGH] th- that's another way of finding out news is to speak to people in ... other areas.
L:  That's right.
R:  Where in Florida are you?
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, I'm in Melbourne which is on the east coast.
R:  Oh, I know where that is.  I went to UCS.

L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  Not that I'm not enjoying talking to you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] but [SIGH] I'm trying to -- you know, stay on topic and so --
