R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Hi, my name is Michelle.
R:  Hi, I'm Susan.    [SIGH]
L:  Ah, I'm from Lawrence, Massachusetts.
R:  I'm from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, it's actually interesting that this is the topic because, ah --, I'm just online right now [LAUGH] looking at CNN dot com to get the daily news.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is that what you usually do?
L:  Yeah, I usually -- I get a lot of it on the Internet.  I do, um -- we subscribe to the local paper and, ah, the Boston Globe on Sundays but it's just easier to get it ... off the Internet, [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- for me anyway.  How about you?
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, um, [SIGH] I -- I [SIGH] don't do a very good job right now of keeping up --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with current events.  When I wake up in the morning I -- I have my TV on [SIGH] so I have some of the morning news.  [SIGH]  And then, ah, [SIGH] I try to catch the evening news on TV.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, we do get the paper.  I haven't had much time to read it in the past month,  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I do use the Internet a lot and I have my, ah, home page -- the web page that comes up as my homepage has a lot of headlines on it.
L:  Right.  [MN]  Yeah.  Me too.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I tend to get too angry at the news when I'm watching it on TV and I start yelling at the TV and then I think I'm insane.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I think it's just best if I [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- not [NOISE] do it that way.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  But that's just me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I like -- I just have it on sort of as background, you know, I'm making dinner, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and doing other things and [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I try to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at least pick up on some things.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  I'll tell you -- I'll tell you sometimes it's not easy just -- sometimes it's just too [LAUGH] d- depressing.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  [SIGH]  'Cause it seems that there's very really good news.  So, ... [LIPSMACK] sometimes it's hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But, um, [NOISE] I don't know -- I especially -- I do like to keep -- I -- I do especially like to keep in -- in touch with what's going on locally.  [MN]  [SIGH]  I mean nationally if you can hear about it -- just people talking about it but the local news  -- 'cause I don't work in my home town so, um, it's just [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I just, ah, like [COUGH] keeping up with that [SIGH] so that I can least feel like [LAUGH] I'm a part of the community, I guess.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I guess that's true.  [SIGH]  I, ah, [SIGH] I guess a lot of the most important news Il find out anyway from colleagues.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's hard to avoid the really big [LAUGH] s- stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, although I -- I [NOISE] -- I mean we're -- I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm in graduate school so, um, [SIGH] I'm -- I'm really surprised that, you know, --
L:  What are you studying?
R:  -- as little  as --I'm  studying medicine.
L:  Oh, wow!  Good for you.
R:  But as little as I get of the news [SIGH] it seems like everybody else gets e- even less.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I always c- come a- and say something ... like, "Oh, by the way did you know there's a new twenty dollar bill?" and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- really good.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, it's easy to -- [SIGH] it's easy to get wrapped up especially -- I mean studying medicine it's not exactly a -- an easy thing so ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and these sort of current events that we've looking up are p- pretty much current events in medicine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And that's hard enough to keep up with.
L:  Yeah, well, we all overloaded with some of it though, hearing about the SARs [SIGH] but ...
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  But, ah, [SIGH] yeah.  [SIGH] [NOISE] [MN]  [PAUSE]  And sometimes I do think [SIGH] keeping up with current events is over rated because by the time you hear about it the situation has changed.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  It becomes old news.
L:  [SIGH]  I know what you mean, um, -- I -- I -- I'm a lawyer so I tend to more ... focus on the legal news too, so I know what you mean -- what you mean about s- scanning for what pertains to your profession.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [SIGH]
L:  So, ... [LIPSMACK]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  This is a weird topic there's not a whole lot to say on up.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, not ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I mean there's only so many m- mediums --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we can discuss about --
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.
R:  -- [LAUGH] getting news.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well do -- you -- so, you -- you watch the news, do you watch any of the news magazines or ... like Dateline or Sixty Minutes?
R:  I, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I sometimes do for -- for entertainment value.  I don't know h- how much I can take them seriously but, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I [SIGH] -- I've run in run in fairly tough rotations the past few months so I really don't have time.
L:  Right.  [MN]
R:  But if it's a choice between a ... sitcom or a -- a news magazine I'll usually choose the news magazine.
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Me too and also if I hear something [NOISE] that looks ... especially interesting, that's going to be on then I'll ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, sometimes I'll make a point --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- to turn it on.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Exactly.  [LIPSMACK]  Well, ten minutes is a long time, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I haven't been keeping track are we doing a good job?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  I -- I -- actually I didn't ca- -- I didn't c- catch what time we started talking so ...
R:  No, neither did I.  [SIGH]
L:  So, I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But, ah, ...
R:  [NOISE]  So, what is the best, ah, web pages that you find for -- for news?
L:  [SIGH]  I go to Drudge, ah, dot com because there it has -- um, I like reading editorials from different places and there it has links to, um, the -- th- -- t- to all the ... major editorialists and the country and, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- 'cause I like getting different takes on the news especially ... since I -- I'm very liberal so I like reading the conservative ... point of view to see if they can change my mind, --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and they usually can't so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Drudge dot com --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I hadn't heard of that.
L:  It's just -- it's -- it's just l- like a clearing house site where it leads you to -- well you can get breaking news and, um, it -- it leads you to about -- I'd say about a hundred and fifty other sites f- for news and it's just ... to me the easiest because there are [SIGH] certain columnists like Maureen Dowd[?] from the Times.  I like to read her.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it just ge- -- it just gets me there quickly.  And also he does big headlines of, you know, whatever happens to go on and just leads you to [SIGH] a concise story on it.  Like the Associated Press story so, it's just -- you get it quickly.
R:  Oh!
L:  [SIGH]  So, ... because I don't have the most trying to hunt down news.  [LAUGH]
R:  Where to find it out, yeah.  [SIGH]  Where are you from originally?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  New Hampshire.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I grew up in --
R:  Are you living in Boston right now?
L:  What?
R:  Are you living in Boston right now?
L:  Well -- ah, Lawrence is just outside.
R:  [MN]  Okay, you don't have a Boston accent.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Thank God.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  No, I've avoided that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- although I've lived in the area for about ten years so --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- I keep expecting to hear it in my voice some day but [LIPSMACK] I can still say car without saying +car.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  So, do you  keep up with a lot of news from New Hampshire or ...
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, no.
R:  No.
L:  No, I left New Hampshire behind.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, there wasn't -- where -- I came from a very small town and there wasn't a whole lot of news [SIGH] and what there was everyone knew anyway.  [NOISE]  So, ... [SIGH] you couldn't walk down the street without someone knowing it so ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  It was --
R:  I always get a kick out of going back to my home town and -- and --
L:  Where r you from?  [MN]
R:  Um, from [LIPSMACK] a small town in the Pokonos in Pennsylvania.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, Wow!
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And, ah, it's just interesting to watch the local ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- news channels when I'm home and r- read their paper that consists of, like, ten pages and ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Well, it's just strange because my parents moved, oh, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from my hometown too so I have no family left there.  So ...
R:  I have to go back and even check it out.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, [SIGH] yeah, my parents live and Maine now and so -- that's good to visit because they live near the beach.  So, ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  So, ... but it is funny li -- every once in awhile -- I don't know, in a weather report they'll say that it's, you know, sixty degrees and eleven in Hampshire and it's just -- it gives -- that does give me a kick.
R:  Oh!
L:  like, "Oh, yeah.  I lived there for sixteen years".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]  So, ... [MN]
R:  Do you get a lot of news from, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- magazines like Time or -- or US News?
L:  Ah, I sub- -- I get Newsweek so --
R:  Newsweek?
L:  -- yeah, I do read that.  And then, also, ah, I'll sometimes look online to see what Time magazine had or you know ...
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Actually, during the war in Iraq I got a lot of news from the BBC America because the wanted a different take and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it was shocking how much different the reports were coming out of the US than they were coming out of Britain.  It was --
R:  Really?
L:  -- oh, yeah, it was amazing.  [SIGH]  There was a lot of stuff that was being shown on the BBC that wasn't being shown here and it was really [SIGH] -- what -- what -- it was surprising but it was also -- I was real -- I was a little horrified.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Goodness!
L:  'Cause I just think, um, -- I -- I thought we were doing a good job showing everything and we really weren't.  [NOISE]  We were ... f- filtering it quite a bit it would seem.  [SIGH]  So, ... that was interesting.
R:  Yeah, it's always a wakeup call to -- to realize [SIGH] how filtered our -- our news is.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, you know, they show us what they want us to know.  And --
L:  Yeah, --
R:  -- and they take it, you know --
L:  -- I know everyone does that but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know when we hear freedom of the press you -- I know what you're saying don't take that for granted.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  I mean I take my news at face value because [SIGH] that's really all I get.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I guess even in medicine if I hear news [NOISE] you really don't believe -- you want to see the evidence.  You want to see w- -- the studies.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, e- especially in your field I mean it's progressing so quickly that -- I mean you  don't know from o- one day to the next what the next study is going to show, and [NOISE] [SIGH] ... especially in pharmaceuticals.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  Right.  And if we get news from the pharmaceutical reps as well.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  What, ah, area of medicine are you ... going into?
R:  Um, I'm not entirely sure.  I'm debating between family practice and pediatrics.
L:  Oh!
R:  I have a few more months to decide.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's good.  [LAUGH]  Both wonderful fields and they need people desperately.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  What sort of law do you practice?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Family law.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, I'm glad you didn't say malpractice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  No.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  No.  [LAUGH]  Stay away from that.  I pay my malpractice insurance and that's as far as it goes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
