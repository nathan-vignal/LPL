L:  Melissa.
R:  Hi, I'm Kim.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, Kim.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  Um, we have a current event topic.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] This is, um, [LIPSMACK] interesting.  I, uh, get my current events through the television news, both the regular local channels and the national broadcast channels.
R:  Okay.
L:  And the newspaper and the internet and my husband.  He's in the military.
R:  Oh, he is?  Okay.
L:  So, I get a lot of updates through him.
R:  Okay.
L:  Versus the -- the media because I think the media gets things twisted.
R:  Right.
L:  Or they, I don't know, they go a little far fetched.
R:  Right.
L:  Exaggerating. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  Mine is basically probably through, um, through like TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- probably, um, just the local stations and, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- a little bit on the internet.  Like when I first sign on like my homepage might --
L:  Exact- -- yeah.
R:  -- have just like the headlines.
L:  Yeah, that's all I get too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't --
R:  And, you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- occasionally something catches my eye you might click on it or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but that's about it.  Or [MN], um, if my husband like hears -- he's not in the military, but I mean, if he hears something on the radio or something we might talk about it but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess the main thing would be probably, um, the local television stations.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And that.
L:  We get the paper subscription.  I'll just -- pretty much the cover page --
R:  Yeah.
L:  On the weekend.  Just Sundays --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'll just like look at the headlines and same thing with the internet.  If it catches my eye then I'll go and finish reading the article on it but most times it's get a gist of what's going on by the headlines of things.
R:  Yeah, that's kind of how I do too.
L:  And, um, and it's like, "Okay", then go to the sale ads. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, we just get it on Sunday as well and I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, skim through it basically.
L:  Yeah, and, um, I like the national channels.  I thought that was kind of neat how they had the -- the embedded reporters --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  -- throughout the wartime.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I thought that was kind of interesting.  
R:  That was.  Now, we don't have, um, like, um, CNN or Fox.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we just have the basic, um, stations and so --
L:  Mhm.  Oh, they even had some.
R:  Yeah, they did.
L:  Well, they started to down here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The local, uh, our own -- we live down in North Carolina and our local North Carolina station --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- had a embedded reporter that would report for the National NBC like for Tom Brokaw and whatnot.
R:  Okay.
L:  That was kind of interesting.  So, it was like our own little local --
R:  That is neat.
L:  -- reporter was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one of the people over there.
R:  That gives you a be- -- a better connection.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- yeah.
L:  Be- Because they just came back.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, th- that's in the news now. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, so that was -- that was neat.  I also, um, [MN] throughout different shows, especially like in the evening, um, they'll have a like just the topics running across the bottom --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the screen and I tend to keep up that way a little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bit too. 
L:  I do that.  Um, I'm a big channel surfer between all the different stations.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And even the news stations to see who's reporting what and I liked how, um, headline news in CNN they have it scrolling across every thirty minutes they update it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it gives you, instead of just a little scroll, it gives like other stories --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- besides all the war coverage.
R:  Right.
L:  They'll give you other stories and stuff so that was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- nice and, um --
R:  And probably the -- I would think the biggest way I would get news is to be more specific is probably like the today show or Good Morning America.  
L:  Yeah, morning shows.
R:  Yeah, the morning shows and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't tend to watch the evening news.  Occasionally if I wanna see, um, like the weather or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I might but, um, it's probably more -- I just have the --
L:  In the -- morning shows.
R:  -- mornings hows on.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As we're getting ready.
L:  I think they're a little bit more interesting in their coverage --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- also instead of it being a little more suited and stuffy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the older reporters. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, Kenny[?] Kirk is what?  Better to listen to than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Than rather  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, well then also I think nowadays like Sixty Minutes and Dateline --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're doing the reports where it's not necessarily a news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a news based show and they handle current events but it's not just like watching your six o'clock news.
R:  Right.
L:  They can get some interesting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- topics on those shows also.
R:  They do.  In the perspective that they, you know, and it's just -- it's just very interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just to find out [MN] 'cause you might've heard about it but then --
L:  It's a little more in depth.
R:  Yeah, they go in depth.  I like that.
L:  Than just the headline news.
R:  Right.  That is correct.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that is.  So, [SIGH] your husband, is he on active duty now?
L:  Yes.
R:  Is he?  Okay.  So, he gets updates and then gives them to you.
L:  Right.
R:  That's another way.
L:  Like I'll -- I'll see something on the news.  Like when we actually started bombing, um, I saw it ha- -- as it was happening on TV and so I called him real quick at work 'cause he's still State side --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he didn't even know about it at the time.
R:  Oh.
L:  So -- 'cause they didn't have a radio on, they didn't have a TV on.
R:  Right.
L:  That's another thing.  We get it on the radio obviously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They break in with special reports.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so I informed him so that w- -- they could get to somewhere that -- to get information.
R:  Right.
L:  But there's other instances where I guess I don't know if he's not supposed to say type things but --
R:  Okay.
L:  There could be events where there's things that may possibly -- everything's a, "May possibly happen".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They're like never set in stone until it actually happens.  So, like if they're gonna have deployments to relieve other people that's a possibility or -- so it's not really necessarily current events that I get from my husband but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just things that could affect our lifestyle because of the way things are going --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- or whatnot.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  But --
R:  My brother, um, [LIPSMACK] he's still in basic training.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and [MN] we -- my parents had talked to him the other day and asked -- or this is a couple of weeks ago actually, and asked about, um, the war and stuff and he said we probably knew more than he did.  'Cause in --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- basic like they kind of kept them like from that.
L:  Yeah, y- they don't really have much access to it and such.
R:  Right.
L:  With the media coverage it is true that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it seems as if that everybody else knows more than the people that are actually in the military --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, you know, they just get briefed as to what they need to know.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's like I get, um, more so current events locally here on base like if there's something that happens on base --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- current event wise, then my husband'll tell me 'cause I don't know what goes on, on base.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, if we have somebody come in to visit.  Like we had, um, the President of Poland.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so they'll come and tell me about it so I know don't go on base that day 'cause security's gonna be horrible.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, so it's more so like local current events on base I get from him, more so than the national stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the national stuff he gets more information from the media than what they would talk about at work unless like some of our troops are coming home then obviously he knows about that.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, that type of thing.  It just depends on the --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- severity of it, I guess.  But --
R:  True.  Yeah, the radio -- I probably don't get too much information from the radio.
L:  No.
R:  It's more or less I just kind of listen to it in my car going to and from --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- places.
L:  Like -- just like a morning show.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's pretty much what I enjoy in the morning would be a morning show where they're doing the news and even so that is more of a comical type news or --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  -- making fun of things.
R:  It's -- it's a lot more laid back and --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  I just try not to get too preoccupied in the current events but I like to know some of the major things that go on but --
R:  Yeah, the basics [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, you know --
R:  -- that I need to know, yeah.
L:  So, I'm not completely clueless.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] That's how it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is neat.
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  I know [inaudible] --
L:  I don't know what else to talk about.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Have you done this a lot? 
L:  No.  This is the second one.
R:  This is my second one as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, it seems like, you know, it's been going good so far talking and I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- remember what time we started. [LAUGH]
R:  Me neither.  That's all right.
L:  I don't know if -- how strict they are, if we have to stick to that topic or --
R:  I'm not --
L:  -- veer from it.
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure either.  Ba- like the last time we did it we basically -- I mean, like a couple of things, you know, we got off it just a couple of times and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then we got right back on it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not sure either.  But --
L:  [SIGH] Hm. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  I'm trying to think what other current events are going on.  This -- I -- 'cause the topic I understand is talking about the current events, where we get it from.
R:  Mhm, [LIPSMACK] yeah.
L:  Not necessarily talking about the current events that are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- going on but where do you get your current events from.
R:  Yeah, basically how we receive our --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- information and --
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  The other thing would be, um, friends and family and that's kind of comical on my part 'cause my mother in law will always call me and tell me what's on TV or -- or what she's heard or whatnot and my mother in law's notorious for getting things totally twisted.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you tell her one thing and two seconds later, while you're still in the room, she will tell somebody else with her own pitch on it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it doesn't make any sense and it's not the same thing but I'm just like, "Okay, whatever".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But she's another one.  She's notorious for calling me, especially during the wartime stuff. 
R:  Oh, my word.
L:  Mm, freaking out about it and telling me what's going on and, "Turn on the TV and what has Bobby heard?" Or, "Is he gonna go there?" Or whatnot and I'm like, "Okay", so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think for some people all of the wartime media was a little too much for them.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It was a little much.  I mean, we're s- -- 'cause that -- I mean, it -- that was all over the internet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And it was on every T station.
L:  Every single channel.  
R:  And --
L:  Local and national and whatnot.
R:  Right, and yeah, you couldn't flip through without seeing that and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The other thing is it was so up close and personal by, you know, the -- all the media coverage there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how they were right with, um, the soldiers and stuff.  That was -- that kind of was a little much. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I know, um, it -- there's a lot of people that couldn't stand to have it on so much.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause they have friends and family overseas and I was fortunate -- I did watch it all the time or it was -- it seemed addictive --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at first and then I just had to force myself, "Okay, I'm just not gonna watch the TV today", and turn it off 'cause like it seemed like it was on for weeks.
R:  Right.
L:  And then, um, I think if -- it would be different if my husband was overseas.  I don't know how I would react to all that.
R:  Right.
