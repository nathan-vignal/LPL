L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi, this is Debbie.
L:  I'm Beatrice.
R:  I'm --
L:  What city are you in?
R:  I'm in Kansas, in Wichita.
L:  Uh, I'm in New York City.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, New York, New York, Manhattan.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]  So, how do you get your events here?
L:  [MN]
R:  Watch TV?
L:  No, I don't.  I usually get my events from the radio.  I spend a great deal of time in my kitchen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, and the radio's on all the time and really that's how I distill it mostly.  Um, I also see some newspapers but I -- I'm not a -- I don't have a lot of time for reading.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So most of it comes vocally on the radio.  And, uh, I find that quite effective, I -- I'm not very astute about what's going on in the news but I have an idea.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  How about you?
R:  Oh, I -- I usually just catch the highlights on the six and ten o'clock news.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, I don't know, it's just too depressing most the time anyway.
L:  Oh, really it is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It really is.  I really don't know what's going on.  I r- -- I heard today on the radio that the dollar is in decline, that the president wants a weak dollar --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that means that all currency is stronger than ours, or strong compared to ours.
R:  Uh-huh, that doesn't surprise me.
L:  And that's kinda miserable.
R:  Yeah, it is.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  Very sad.
L:  Especially if you travel.  I just came back from Canada today.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh --
R:  Well, you're not far from Canada though.
L:  No, I was in New Brunswick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, the -- the Canadian dollar's getting stronger, which means that we can buy less with our American dollars.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I think the thing that upsets me most in the news is the terrorism in the Middle East.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  That whole scene is so upsetting.
R:  It really is.  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, we live, uh --
L:  So --
R:  -- just a few doors down from Patrick Miller, I don't -- if you know the first POW that came home?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, he just lives down the street from me and --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- he's been home for a few days now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's --
L:  Do you know him personally?
R:  Yes, he's a good friend of my son.
L:  Oh really?
R:  They worked together and went to school together and [LAUGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is he the one that was interviewed on television and had these horrific stories to tell?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I know --
L:  'Cause I --
R:  -- he's -- he -- the media has just been bombarding him, I know that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's got a press secretary even now. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wow.
R:  That the military supplied him with just to keep tack of all the calls he gets.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...  But he's trying to just spend time with his wife and baby, so --
L:  Oh sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm glad he came home.
R:  Oh yeah, me too.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]  So, anyway, I, um -- do you read the papers at all?
R:  [LIPSMACK] On Sunday.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  On Sunday.  They've gotten so expensive here that [MN] I just don't bother with 'em except on Sunday!
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I've often found that the library will supply me w- -- I don't know how the library works in Kansas but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in New York the libraries subscribe to papers and so if --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you've missed something you can always go to the library and look it up.
R:  Oh yeah.  I -- I find myself --
L:  Which I frequently -- yeah.
R:  I go online sometimes and look things up too, in the -- in the paper.
L:  Oh that's true too, I didn't think of that, that's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a very viable way.
R:  Really.  And the Internet, gosh, I mean, that's [SIGH] -- as soon as kick in AOL it's got today's news right on the front page.
L:  Yeah.  And you can find something old even.  I remember looking for something that I had seen in, uh, one of the New York Times magazines and I couldn't remember quite when it was but I remembered exactly what the topic was.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I did a search and I was so surprised to find it.
R:  It's amazing what you can find on the Internet.
L:  Yeah, it's wonderful.
R:  I love it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What do you do?
R:  I am, uh, disability retired.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I don't do a whole lot right now [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, so you have time for the Internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I do.  I spend a lot of time on the Internet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of time with my grandson.
L:  Oh how lov- -- lucky you are to have a grandchild.
R:  [MN] Sometime --
L:  Something I wish for.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  He is going to be three in July and he's a lot faster than I. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  It's tough to keep up with him right now.
L:  He sounds cute.
R:  He is, he's adorable.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Well, anyway --
L:  I have a son but he's not married.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  How old is he?
L:  He's forty one.
R:  He's forty one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And not married?
L:  You know, the funny thing --
R:  Oh man.
L:  -- is, none of the -- none of the boys in my family are married except one sister's one son.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's funny.  I'm -- y- young people in New York have a hard time finding one another.
R:  Huh, that's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had no idea.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Round here they seem to find each other pretty young.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, my son just turned twenty one and my --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- grandson is three, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, your -- your twenty one year old son has a three year old child?
R:  Yes, he does.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  And he has full custody of him.
L:  He what?
R:  He has full custody 'cause the momma just took off.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  So --
L:  That must be difficult.
R:  It's challenging but he wouldn't trade it for anything.
L:  Yeah.  I suppose he relies upon you a great deal.
R:  Oh, not too much.  He's got a real wonderful, wonderful woman in his life right now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She's just awesome.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think we'll keep her! [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's nice.
R:  I hope he keeps her, anyway! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But anyway, back --
L:  So --
R:  -- to the news.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's turned cold here again, that's news to us in May.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause usually it's hot.
L:  Well, in New Brunswick there was ice and snow.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  We were in the, uh, caves on the Bay of Fundy and there were icicles hanging from the ceiling.
R:  Oh wow, how neat!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Gosh.
L:  And then as we came back to New York we drove.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  As we drove back to New York we saw spring unfolding as we went.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because here the -- the magnolias and the forsythias and all that have already passed.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there they hadn't even started.
R:  Oh my.
L:  Yeah, I was -- it was nice to see the cherry blossoms again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're beautiful, I don't know if you have those out in Kansas but --
R:  Yeah, we do.
L:  -- they're wonderful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh --
R:  We do indeed [inaudible] here.
L:  Yeah, the weather is very peculiar, I -- I kind of wondered why all this is happening.
R:  I don't know.
L:  When we were warned about global warning, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- global warming and all of that.
R:  Yeah, I know, it's like, cold in May.  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't get that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, maybe --
R:  I mean, it's --
L:  -- this is a good thing.
R:  Yeah.  Granted it was like, seventy five degrees this morning and it's like, fifty right now.
L:  Wow.
R:  Huh.  So it took a nosedive.
L:  Yeah.  What time is it out there now?
R:  It is ten fifteen.
L:  Oh.  So it's just about an hour earlier --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than us?
R:  Right.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yep, just about.  What do you do?
L:  I am retired from the New York City Board of Ed.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  Where I worked as a secretary for twenty years.
R:  Uh-huh, all right.
L:  Yeah, and a pretty good job it was, I must say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  I think it would be challenging to -- to be teaching in the -- any school system anymore.  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't think it would be?
R:  I think it would be.
L:  Oh, it would be, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, the New York City school system is especially hard 'cause they keep changing the rules.
R:  [LAUGH] That doesn't surprise me, they do that here too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  My cousin, uh, is a retired teacher here and he taught in -- in what we call The War Zone.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he taught shop.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it was -- he said it was pretty scary having all these, uh, car tools around --
L:  The -- the tools, sure.
R:  -- with all these troubled kids. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Did anyone get hurt?  Did he tell stories?
R:  Uh, no there were a +few -- few times where there's been guns pulled and things but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] he's just glad to be retired now. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And live through it.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the working life is not easy.
R:  No, it's not.
L:  I did it for forty four years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Until I finally retired.  I worked a long time.
R:  It seems like you can't help -- you have to, I mean [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My mother, bless her heart, still works.
L:  Really?  But out of --
R:  And she's --
L:  -- preference, right?
R:  Mm, out of necessity.
L:  Outta -- oh no.
R:  Because my dad's meds just cost too much.
L:  Oh goodness.
R:  You know.  And she ha- -- they have to, uh -- they have to have supplemental insurance 'cause --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Medicare doesn't cover everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So she's, uh, pushing eighty and still works at Sears.
L:  It's amazing.  She --
R:  I know.
L:  And she's spry and has the strength?
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  It's wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In a way, uh, you know, if you look at the other side of the coin, it's quite marvellous.
R:  I know.  I'm -- I'm just jealous, you know! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I don't have half her energy. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I wish I did. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  How did you find out about this, uh, what shall we call it?  Program.
R:  Um, oh I had found a link to it from -- I can't remember where.
L:  Oh.
R:  One of my other shopping sites.
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you do mystery shopping as well?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, that -- that sounded like fun, there's somebody in New York who does it, that I know.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- y- -- it's different. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You get to meet a lotta people.
L:  D- do you have to pay them a fee for the privilege of being given --
R:  No.
L:  -- leads?
R:  No.  There are those out there that charge a fee but I don't go with them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause I don't -- I don't think you should have to pay to get a job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, no.  They pay me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And -- and then you have the benefit of keeping all the things that you accrue.
R:  Occasionally, yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I get a lotta free meals.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of free meals.
L:  How did you link to that?
R:  Oh gosh, I went to -- I just went to Mystery Shopping I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it just sent me to link to link to link and I started signing up.
L:  Hm.  [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I think I'm probably gonna do it too.
R:  It's kinda fun.
L:  It sounds like great fun.
R:  It is.  It -- you get to be like an actress, [LAUGH] you know?  Put on different personalities and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And do different things, so it's neat.
L:  But in the restaurants they want you to keep careful track of how long it takes between service and stuff like that, right?
R:  Um, a lot of the restaurant stuff is cleanliness and -- and, yeah, service --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- is important.  Do they smile?  I --
L:  Oh.
R:  I've learned that people don't seem to smile much anymore around here.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  And that's sad 'cause [SIGH] you should smile more.
