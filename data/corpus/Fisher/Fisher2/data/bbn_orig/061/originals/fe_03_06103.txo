L:  I'm Kirsten.
R:  Hi, I'm Mary.  So, how do you get your news?
L:  Oh, um, I didn't know I didn't know I had to talk.  Uh, mostly from the TV.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I don't have time to read the paper too much or   How about you?
R:  Um, [SIGH] probably mostly from the radio.  Like, um, I listen to public radios in the morning just when I eat my breakfast and that's pretty much all I get. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  That's a good way to get it.
R:  So, what are you following then on ?
L:  Um, like the -- the war and [SIGH] crimes and stuff like that. [MN] But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so do you usually watch like the nightly news show that comes on or something, or --
L:  Yeah, like -- like usually like the eleven o'clock news or something just to see what's going on in the world today.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess that   And sometimes in the morning I'll turn on the news when I'm getting ready for work.
R:  Yeah.  So, do you feel like you're pretty well informed about what's going on, or ?
L:  Um, yeah mostly.  I mean, I -- I try to keep up with it but sometimes it's hard 'cause I don't get a minute to watch the TV.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, otherwise --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If I -- I listen -- sometimes I'll listen to the radio in the morning --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like on my drive to work and I'll hear, you know, they'll go over the news and stuff.  So, I'll listen to it that way also.
R:  I think I probably get more from my brother at [several inaudible words] emailing some things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause he's so much like more, I guess, more into it than I -- I mean, I am [NOISE] -- I do try to stay informed but, um, I don't know.  I don't guess I really get very much in depth --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- news very much unless it's an issue that I really care about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So 
L:  I -- yeah, I agree on that.  'Cause like when I first -- when the war first started happening I was like really into watching it and seeing what's happened but now I'm not really that much interested in it any more. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It seems like it's the same --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- thing like all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [SIGH] um, I don't know.  It doesn't seem like there's ever anything new any more.
L:  Right.
R:  So [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, th- m- mostly is like the same things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- happening every day like robbings and -- you know, 'cause I -- I live in the Tri State area so a lot of the news is like from New York and --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- all those.  Just stuff that happens in the city.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So --
R:  Well, it looks like they're gonna start talking about the election now though so, I don't know, maybe it -- it'll start getting a little juicier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Make it a --
R:  Like I --
L:  -- little more interesting.
R:  I think now they have like a dozen candidates or something for next year, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I think, um, Bush just declared this week or something and then there were already like ten or eleven democratic candidates.
L:  Oh, that's -- that'll be good.
R:  So, [LAUGH] there should be at least some gossip [LAUGH] about that if --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- nothing else. [LAUGH]
L:  That's exciting.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] How long do we have to do this for?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is this your first time to do it?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, it's ten minutes and they -- they kind of, I guess, leave you to talk and I don't know if we actually have to stick to the topic.  This is my second time to do it.  Um, and then at ten minutes someone comes on and tells you to wrap it up or something.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, but, I mean, I thought [NOISE] -- I think that current event thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is kind of a lame topic. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because they didn't give us a specific one like to debate or discuss or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, the last time I was -- I talked it was, um; if you were going to open your own business, what would it be?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And I thought that was kind of --
L:  Yeah, that's kind of --
R:  -- fun, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like that's kind of a f- -- like we could talk about that if you want --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just because I think they just wanna get our voices.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't think they really care what we talk about.  Um 
L:  [LAUGH] That's --
R:  Because I don't really know anything that's going on in current events right now.  I haven't really been paying that much attention.
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't really.  I mean, once in a while I do but it's just when I'm falling asleep at night I'll t- turn on the news, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, like when I'm just waking up I'm not really that intellectually engaged to know what I'm hearing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- anyway, so I don't really know.  Um, so, I don't know.  We could talk about something different if you want to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just to use up the ten minutes.
L:  Oh, uh, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, where are you from? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, originally I'm from Arkansas but I live in Western Mass now.
L:  Oh, yeah?  That's nice.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  I've never been to Massachusetts. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, it's -- it's pretty. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?
R:  Um --
L:  I heard, um, you know, Boston is fun.
R:  Yeah, Boston's a really cool city.  I haven't actually -- I mean, I've lived here for six years now and I've only been to Boston like four times maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know.  I don't guess I really get out [LAUGH] enough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh, yeah, it's nice.  It's nice to kind of live in the middle of nowhere for a while and, um  [NOISE] I mean, people seem to be pretty [NOISE], um, I don't know, culturally well rounded and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- engaged with what's going on and everything.  So, it's not like Hicksville or anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, yeah, it's pretty nice.
L:  Yeah, I live in, uh, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Whi- which part?
L:  Um, like central.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess you would say.  Yeah.
R:  I have a f- --
L:  I grew up like by the beach but then I, um, I moved like more up north.
R:  Ah. [SIGH]
L:  So 
R:  I have a friend from there and I cannot for the life of me remember the town she's from.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I wanna say something like Montclair?
L:  Montclair, yeah.
R:  So, yeah, okay if that sounds right 'cause i- i- --
L:  Yeah, that's like North Jersey.
R:  Yeah, I think it's pretty close to New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  I like it here but, um, I wanna move on eventually.
R:  Yeah?  Where would you move on to?
L:  Um, I really, um, love Miami Beach and I wanna move there.
R:  Oh, wow, that's really far.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I really wanna move there.  I think I'm gonna after school's finished which will be next September for me, so --
R:  Oh, cool, congratulations.
L:  Thank you.
R:  Is this college or --
L:  Um --
R:  -- something else?
L:  Well, I went to -- I went to college but, um, [LIPSMACK] I, uh, I decided that there wasn't anything that I really wanted to do so I went back to school for, um, cardiac stenography.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I graduate in September.  I'm very excited and can't wait. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.  So, are i- -- so do --
L:  I've been going to school forever. [LAUGH]
R:  I know the feeling. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, s- so, do you kn- -- have you looked into j- -- the job situation in Miami Beach?
L:  Yeah, um, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  In Florida it's like predominantly older people, you know, so --
R:  Yeah, so you'd have lots of business, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause heart disease, you know, is relevant all over. [LAUGH] So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's always really, you know, gonna be a job which is really good for me.  So   Like the -- I think the health --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- field like I just -- I decided that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I wanted to do that because you can't go wrong.  Like it's not something that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're, you know, they're gonna eliminate ever --
R:  Right.
L:  And so there -- there's always a need for it.  And I -- I've really, um -- I was working with computers and not dealing and interacting with people and I just -- I'm like a people person and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I like to engage in conversations with people and, you know, help people so it wasn't really the field for me to be into.  So, I decided to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- change and do this.
R:  Cool.
L:  And I really -- I really like it.  It's really interesting and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's kind of tough, hard but, you know 
R:  So, is that like whe- -- is that same things as, um -- sorry this is gonna sound really ignorant but like I've had an echocardiogram before?
L:  Yeah, that's what it is.
R:  That's the same thing?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  So   I'm excited.  I can't wait to graduate.
R:  That sounds good. [NOISE] Miami --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sounds good. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Like I ha- -- I went to school, had my bachelors[?] and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I didn't know what I wanted to do. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I found this and I had a couple of people that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like knew something about it -- about the field before I went to school and, you know, told me that it was good and you get paid good so   And I really like it now.
R:  Wow.
L:  It took me like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nine years to find something I like. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm still looking, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't feel bad. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's really great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in, um, graduate school in English Lit. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I feel like I've been in school forever too and I'm also thinking, "I'm not sure this is what I wanna do".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Um, although it's a little late since I've --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- been at school like [LAUGH] for ten years now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, I don't know.  I'll see.  I have, um, about one more year.
L:  That's not bad.
R:  I'm almost done with -- or not almost done -- about half way done a [inaudible] but that's the last thing that I have to do and, um, and once I'm finished that I'll be done.  So, then I can kind of, you know, think about; is this really what I want to do, or do I wanna do something completely different?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, 'cause there aren't very many jobs and there are like people -- hundreds of people clamoring for every job that there is 'cause there are way too many people who get English PhDs [LAUGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and not enough jobs, so I'm not totally -- which -- so it's good that I'm not totally like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dying to -- to, you know, teach English for the rest of my life or anything.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I would be okay with it but I think I'd be okay with other things too. [NOISE] So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who knows?
L:  That's good though.
R:  Yeah, good to have options, I guess.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Um, uh, my husband has a one year job in Belgium next year so we're gonna be there for the year.  So, I don't know, maybe I'll kind of look around.
L:  Oh, really?  That's great.
R:  Yeah, so I might look around and see if, you know, if I can get any ideas just being in a totally different environment.
