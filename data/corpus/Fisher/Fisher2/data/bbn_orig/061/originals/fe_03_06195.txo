L:  And do you like the rides, going to amusement parks?
R:  Oh yes, definitely.
L:  Oh, yes, we do too.  That's what we do.  Matter of fact, um, on one of my travels we hit, uh, Sea World.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] oh, the -- oh, that museum there.
R:  No.
L:  The Rock and Roll Museum.
R:  Oh, the Hall of Fame -- Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
L:  Then we went to, um, Kings -- King's Point.
R:  Kings Island?
L:  [NOISE] Kings Island.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Cedar, uh, Cedar Point.
R:  Uh-huh.

R:  Mm.
L:  And 'cause we like -- like I said, we're, uh, you know, that's another pastime, you know, another hobby, is going on roller coasters.
R:  Oh yeah.  Um, let me see, goodness.  Do you do crafts?
L:  Crafts?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh --
R:  Any homema- --
L:  Not too often, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I really don't have the time to, you know, like during the day to really do that 'cause I -- another hobby of mine is babysitting.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And right now I have four here.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  You know.  And, uh, but's that's like I says, it's -- it's a hobby, it gives you a little s- money, spending money to do your hobbies, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So.
R:  I do -- I turned my hobby into a business and I do, um, crafts.
L:  What kind of crafts do you do?
R:  I do every kind.  I do -- done sewing clothing, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- woodworking.  I have relatives that's got the stalls and stuff that I need and I do the tall[?] painting.  Um --
L:  That's n- [NOISE] --
R:  Home interiors is one of my favorites --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that I like to do.  Uh, I just bought a house a year ago and totally remodelling it.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  Yeah, and so it's -- it's -- it's really great when you have a hobby to see -- especially if it's a project.
L:  Right.
R:  To see the outcome of it.
L:  Especially in wood too, wood is such a big thing right now.
R:  Oh definitely.  And, uh, this old house I got has got a lot of woodwork in it that I'm restoring.
L:  Yes.
R:  But i- it's like, really pretty to see it come out.  I -- I love old woodwork.
L:  Now you're, um, taking the old paint off, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Making it the right co- -- the normal color.
R:  I'm going down to the bare wood.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know why people paint over that, it's so beautiful.
R:  And then sometimes it just -- when it gets so old they start painting over it but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's sometimes cheaper to paint over it than to restore it.
L:  Right, probably.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, I also do floral arrangements.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  Um, one of my hobbies is to do those up and just have another craft show when it's close to wedding time, the wedding season.
L:  Oh right, you must be busy.
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I also, as a hobby even though it's a business, my Mary Kay business.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You just -- anything to keep busy.
L:  Yeah, I know, that's the way I feel.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I've got two kids that are, um, bipolar, so I -- even if they keep me busy I have to keep busy with other things so I don't get frustrated.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, which I think is actually important to why everybody should have hobbies --
L:  A hobby, yes.
R:  -- something to occupy their mind, their thoughts, their time [inaudible] --
L:  And you need release too, from your normal everyday activities too.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  And I think it'll keep the depression --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- away for some people that are depressant. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You just --
L:  'Cause that's why I go bowling, I get away f- -- away f- from --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the house.
R:  Right.
L:  Y- you're talking to adult people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  So that's why, you know, that's why I love bowling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I've been bowling since my nineteen seventy seven I think.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Yes, since, uh [NOISE] -- since my second child was born.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] You -- [NOISE] go inside.  You know.  But you gotta keep your eyes on 'em.  That -- that's -- matter of fact, tonight is my bowling night, so --
R:  Oh great.
L:  Which is -- i- it's a good hobby to do, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Gives me exercise, 'cause that's the only exercise I do.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't consider exercise a hobby, do you?
R:  Uh, it depends.  It depends on what your goals are with it.
L:  Right.
R:  And that kind of stuff.  But, yeah, um, another hobby too is, uh, just meeting people.
L:  Is what?
R:  Just meeting people.
L:  Oh right, yes, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a nice, uh, thing, to meet different people.
R:  Oh definitely.  You learn different cultures, you learn, um, backgrounds.
L:  Right.
R:  The way people live, different things like that.
L:  Oh that's -- you meet them when you and your girlfriends go out.
R:  Uh, on occasions.
L:  On occa- --
R:  But even online.  Online's been --
L:  Oh right.
R:  -- really great.  Especially with like, the -- the refunding with the news boards and stuff.
L:  Right.  W- --
R:  Sometimes you get to know some people more personally when you're back and forth with a certain person.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and that's how my girlfriend got me into it actually.
L:  See, I never -- well, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] my computer's in the bedroom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So during the day I really -- it's very hard for me to go on unless they're all napping. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  So then I go on at night and then by the time you do your, you know --
R:  Your refunds.
L:  -- the things you n- -- you normally do, just to read this and read that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, it's already late, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but to move it out here then -- then you have the kids that'll touch it.  [NOISE] But a computer is a wonderful thing.
R:  Oh yes.  But, uh, you're right.  I had to put mine in my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bedroom because of -- it was a distraction from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting anything done.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Because it's -- it's easy to get lost on the Net! [LAUGH]
L:  You're -- you're not kidding.  But it's a good hobby.
R:  Yes it is, especially when --
L:  You know.
R:  -- it benefits you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, and it's saving you money. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know because [NOISE] like I've said, [NOISE] it's a l- -- you know, like you rebate, I re- -- and -- and if you have [NOISE] to buy anything [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] I- it's easier to get it through the Internet and you're saving money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [NOISE] -- and this is a good hobby too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- chatting! [NOISE]
R:  This is true. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Oh goodness.  I -- I remember they asked --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the questions what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were our hobbies?  To talk about hobbies and why somebody else should have one, but I can't remember what the other question was.
L:  What are your hobbies, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, we all -- we -- we -- at least we know we enjoy our hobbies.
R:  This is true.
L:  I -- I -- I don't remember what the other question is too.
R:  That's -- that's the biggest key too.  I mean, you don't wanna take up a hobby you don't like.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  Because you do wanna keep your interest in it and, uh, basically have the drive for it.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, when you make your flor- -- you make bouquets and everything, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know I had my daughter's made for her communion.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I didn't wanna, uh, have, uh, real flowers 'cause I'm [NOISE] allergic to them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then when my other daughter got married [NOISE] I had all -- but, uh, you'd -- if you do good work it's expensive.
R:  It depends.  Sometimes, see, I also can get like, a vendor's discounts.  It --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just depends on where you go.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  And, um, and some places all o- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like the retail- -- or the wholesalers will open up to the public too for like, a fee.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But one of my favorite things to make when I'm doing the wedding stuff is you birdseed roses out of, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, it's a satin material and you wrap it on wire stem
