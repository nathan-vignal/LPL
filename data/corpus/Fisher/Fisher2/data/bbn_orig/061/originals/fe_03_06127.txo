R:  Hi, I'm Johnny.
L:  Yes, hi.  This is Sandra.  How are you?
R:  Oh, fine.  I have a daughter named Sandra. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  And your name is -- what is it, Dotty?
R:  Johnny.
L:  Johnny?
R:  Johnny, yeah.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They -- this is, uh, my first call. 
R:  Mine too. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and they -- what did they say?  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  The topic of the day is current events?
R:  Yeah, how do we get our current events?  Do we get 'em through the newspaper or television, or from friends, or ?  Uh, how do we -- how do we get most of our current events?
L:  Right, right.  
R:  I get most of mine on the television.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I'm a -- I'm a, uh, a reader.
R:  Yeah, no --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't do much reading at all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I can't sit still long [LAUGH] enough to --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to read. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it does --
R:  [MN]
L:  It [MN] -- I mean, it, you know, sometimes it depends I guess on what I'm reading but I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I try to read a variety of different, uh, journals --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- magazines, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, just a lot of stuff that I like to read and -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Because I try to get different point of views from --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- different, uh, people, you know.
R:  Yeah, well I -- I talk to, uh, you know, my family members and my friends and things --
L:  Yeah, that too.
R:  -- about things.  Uh, but I'm not, uh, [LIPSMACK] I'm not a b- -- I used to read a lot more and, uh, and lately I've had trouble with my eyes and stuff and so I don't read as much and we've been moving [NOISE] and that so I   Basically I've been watching the TV and especially since all this has been going on with the, you know, the war and all that kind of stuff.  I think it --
L:  Yeah, that's on the minds of a lot of people.  Most of us really [NOISE] because it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, wars don't really have boundaries [MN] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, no and --
L:  You know.
R:  -- it brings everything right into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That you really see what's going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where I think with just reading it we're kind of distanced away from it.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But I -- I've found too that it kind of makes people a little bit more anxious, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, there is a lot of things I don't like with watching, uh, on TV.  I mean is that [LIPSMACK] the families of these members and that are seeing things in a way that's very hard for 'em to see I think.
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  You know, if they get notification that their son or daughter is injured or something like that it's bad enough but if you actually see it on television it's pretty -- pretty traumatic.
L:  Yeah, I would think so, you know.
R:  And I do also think that, uh, uh, today that on television they give too much information.
L:  Yeah.  A lot of it is overkill. 
R:  Yeah, you know, and --
L:  So[?] --
R:  -- there's too much as to -- of, oh, where our -- where our ships are or where -- what we're planning to do and things like that that I think, you know, I know I'm -- I'm older and I remember back, you know, when I was littler and World War Two was on that, uh, you know, you just didn't talk about anything like that and my god you could've been arrested. [MN] And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- today they're -- they're giving all this information as to what's happening and what we're planning on doing next and -- even with local robberies and things like that.  They --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They tell --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- how they got the information and how the bomb was made and how -- you know, all that kind of stuff and I think, "If you don't know it, not that you can't go on online and find it out I mean that you can, but I think it just gives a lot of ideas to people, you know, that don't need those ideas. [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- yeah, 'cause maybe people wouldn't even have thought about it.
R:  That's what I mean, yeah.
L:  That's right.  That's --
R:  And it just gives you -- and I'm -- I'm a firm believer that like with --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- these people that are sadistic, you know, rapists and things like that.  It was bad enough when they just thought about these things and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then when they read about 'em it made it even -- even more effective for them and then when they actually see these things and, uh, I think it really gets them stirred up.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And they hear how violent these other people are I think it really gets them stirred up.  I really do.
L:  I thi- -- you know, maybe it's a sign of the times, you know --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- because I think people seem to be -- I know myself sometimes I have to be careful too to mo- -- to make sure that I'm sensitive to other people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and what other people are going through.  It doesn't have to be that I'm going through it, you know, it's another human being.
R:  Well, right, right.
L:  You know, and people, I think, we've become a little bit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So wrapped up in our own lives.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, absolutely.  I know I --
L:  You know.
R:  -- lost a son two years ago and, uh, you know, after that -- I've always been I think a pretty compassionate person, but after that it puts you more in tune.  So like when you read of somebody losing a child or something like that, you don't only think, "Oh, my god that's terrible".  You feel what they're feeling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because you've gone through it, you know.  And --
L:  Helps you to --
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think this is the thing that, uh, a lot of our society today has lost compassion.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah, and it's --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- funny because, you know, we have so called more technology --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they were -- you know, years ago I know people were, um, really looking forward to what so called science is gonna be able to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, you can't -- science can't make people get along.  Science can't make people respect one another.
R:  No. [MN]
L:  And, you know, I mean, I look at the kids.  I was talking with a lady today, um, and, you know, we were talking just a little bit about the lack of, uh, respect that people, you know, p- -- younger -- not even just younger people.  People in general using profanity and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, there's no -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know -- you know, like people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are not embarassed --
R:  No.
L:  -- if someone walks into a room.  You know, sometimes guys even used to be careful to not curse around women.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, women today are -- are as -- just as bad as a lot of the guys.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, it really is.  It's terrible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think we've gotten desensitized because in the way they dress.  In the way they speak to one another.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, in all the things that are happening.  I mean, I know there were murders and all this stuff back years and years ago.  You didn't hear about it as much.
L:  I think, uh --
R:  And so when you did hear about it, it really upset you.  Today that's all you see and hear and so people are desensitized.
L:  Yeah.  Uh --
R:  You know, it's no big thing.  Somebody -- "Oh, my god, somebody killed fifteen people.  Boy that's too bad".  They go onto something else and --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- five minutes after that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, like you're talking about like buying a dress or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  My son remarks[?] on news.  He says, "You know, these news commentators are on there and they say, 'We have, you know, a tragic thing to report', and they go on about what this tragic thing is, take a breath and say, 'And by the way, what are you doing today about th- --'" and they crack some joke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's like, "I read it off the paper and that's all there is to it".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but that's -- that's the media, you know and --
R:  I know it.  
L:  They definitely have like a lot of -- they -- they hold a lot of, uh, what do you call it?  Influence over how we --
R:  They absolutely do.
L:  How we perceive things even.
R:  Oh, sure.  They do.
L:  You know.  Yeah.
R:  And a lot of people are followers, not leaders, so that if some news caster or something says something, as far as they're concerned it's law and that's the way it should be.
L:  Yeah, that's the truth, right?
R:  They don't pass their own opinion, you know.
L:  No.  That's why I like to read different things from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different sources and try to, uh, you know, think about it and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- too you know some thing -- some things you just have to wait and watch and see how it really turns out.
R:  Oh, I know.  Well, even with --
L:  Right[?].
R:  I have two adult children, you know, and, uh, uh, a lot of times we'll talk over things that's going on just basically to get their input and are they seeing something I don't see?  Or, do they know something I don't know that I wasn't aware of?  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And just get -- bounce it off of one another and kinda get their opinion and, "Yeah, that's what I was thinking too".  Or, "Gee, I didn't take that into consideration", you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, I think that's important to talk to people about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about what -- you know, what's going on in the world.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I have -- yeah.
R:  Because if we don't put our two cents in we can't complain about what's happening.
L:  Right, right.  And try to be the best people that we can be.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  You know.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah, but I think, you know, too it's like moral guidance.  I -- I like to do reading.  I -- I read, um, you know, I -- I read my Bible.  I think that's important.
R:  Yeah, I do too.  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, a lot of people they've -- they've gotten so far away from thinking, uh, anything, you know, spiritu- -- spiritual things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are important.  You know.
R:  Well, you know, we were raised to respect the flag, to respect the country.  Today a lot of these young people don't even know the Pledge of Allegiance, don't know anything about what's happened in the past, don't --
L:  No.
R:  -- believe that the Holocaust ever happened.  Don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they -- they just don't believe these things.  Don't pay any attention. [LIPSMACK] And I object to the fact that they, you know, they won't let you pray in school, they t- make you take down -- like last Christmas you couldn't even by a manger anywhere you went.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you know, but they've got all these other weird things out there and that's all right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's okay for schools to give out condoms, give out all this kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah, that's crazy.
R:  But it's not okay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a child to say their prayers in church.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But yet, you know, and they say --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Keep c- -- Keep the state and, you know, keep the government and religion separate.  Well, they don't.  If you have to go to court you have to swear to god on the Bible.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  You know, our -- our, uh, Pledge of Allegiance I mean, you know, our President, you know, prayers[?] says about praying to the -- to the lord for guidance.  I mean, why is this the only time they pray and I'm sure that when these people that say, "Don't pray".  If they see that they're gonna have an accident or their child was sick or something.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're the first ones to say, "Oh, god, help me".
L:  Yeah, now what do they say the, uh, old saying is that there are no atheists in the fox holes, right?
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] And that -- that really, really annoys me.  I -- I was very upset last Christmas that
