L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi. 
L:  Yeah, this is Alice.  Who is this?
R:  This is Jennifer.  How're you doing?
L:  I'm okay.  
R:  What are we doing here?  What's --
L:  We're talking about current events.  How we keep up with current events --
R:  Oh, God, this --
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yeah, this is the wrong one for me.  I don't keep up with current events. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I try not to, it's sad. 
L:  It -- it's what?
R:  It's sad.
L:  Yeah, I -- it is sometimes.  It sure is.  I don't listen to the news a whole lot.  I do what -- what -- look at my local paper, online --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and, um, try to keep up with the weather, especially here lately in Tennessee since we've been having so many tornados. 
R:  Oh, my God, that's -- I didn't even know you had tornados in Tennessee.
L:  Well, we have --
R:  About time I keep up with current events.
L:  -- [LAUGH] we have this year.  It's been horrible.  Luckily none have hit -- I'm in the Memphis area and I think it was last Thursday night they -- they ta- -- they located 'em or spotted 'em in several areas, but none touched down, thank God, so ...
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But I do merchandising and mystery shopping and in one of the towns I go to, it's about eighty miles away in Jackson, and they got hit by one a couple of weeks ago, so I had to postpone my trip for about a week because it was too, you know, I don't wanna get in all that mess.
R:  Yeah, I can imagine.  I wouldn't --
L:  So ...
R:  -- wanna either. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, where are you from?
R:  I'm up in Boston. 
L:  Are ya?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Okay, this your first call?  Or have you done a Fisher call before?
R:  No, this is my first call.  I didn't know anything about it.  My friend gave me the nu- -- her phone and said, "Do this", and so --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'm doing it. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And of course she gives --
L:  Well, you're going to get paid ten dollars for it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, of course she gives me the one with the current events, which I know nothing about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's sad to say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't. 
L:  Yeah, well, so you don't watch any news or any --
R:  No --
L:  -- reading [inaudible] --
R:  Nope, when the news comes on I change it and I never pick up a newspaper -- 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- ever, it's too depressing.
L:  So, what do you do up in Boston?
R:  Right now, I'm looking for a job.
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I worked for a magazine for a while -- for a little bit and there's a promotion and stuff, but nothing seems to click. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know about it up there, but they're kinda hard to find down here. 
R:  It's kinda hard to find here too.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Everywhere.
L:  The economy is just not the best in the world --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right now.  Which is -- which I think --
R:  And you don't think --
L:  -- is another current event with [several inaudible words] --
R:  Yeah, and you definitely -- you don't need to read the newspaper to know that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You can just feel it.  
L:  Yeah, but it's, um, hopefully it will get better. 
R:  I -- it's got to --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- can't get much worse.  Oh, maybe it can.  I don't know. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  We'll see. [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
L:  But, um, like I said, I don't like -- try to watch too much of the sad stuff, but I do hit on the local newspaper just in case there's something going on I need to know about, or ...
R:  Mhm. 
L:  They -- they used to call me all the time to subscribe.  I finally got it through their head, why would I wanna pay you to drop me a paper in my front yard when I can go online and look at it? 
R:  Yeah.  That's so easy.  
L:  So ...  Mhm.  
R:  I [inaudible] the weather online, does that count?
L:  Yeah, that's current events.  Weather's a current event. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] What's --
R:  Just so I can --
L:  -- the weather like up there right now?
R:  It's beautiful.  It's probably --
L:  Is it?
R:  -- sixty five degrees [NOISE] What is it? [NOISE] No, right now. [NOISE] It's night time.  [NOISE] It's probably about sixty five, it was in the eighties this afternoon.
L:  Was it?  
R:  Yeah, but it's been --
L:  That's about what it was here today.  It wasn't real hot, but we've had a couple of days that were ninety --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- and that was, like, too hot. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's so --
L:  But not as --
R:  -- inconsistent.
L:  -- hot as it's going to get before the summer's over here. 
R:  The summer -- j- -- I think today was the first day that it was actually really warm.  'Cause it gets kind of warm and it's kind of a tease and then it gets cold here.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's not usually like that in May.
L:  Weird weather.  Like I said, I don't know -- my daughter said the other day, "Are we tornado alley now?"  I said, "I don't know". [MN] We sure been --
R:  That's gotta be scary.
L:  -- having a lot of 'em.  Yeah.
R:  She lives out where there's a bunch of tornados. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it was not -- it was not fun.  I was sitting in the hallway with my little Pomeranians and my husband was outside checking the weather, I said, "You dummy, it could suck you up".  He goes, "Oh well, if it's going to suck us up, it's going to suck up [inaudible] the house".
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's one way to look at it.  
L:  [LAUGH] I have one pom that's not scared and I have two that -- well, I have one, my youngest one, he's terrified of even thunder storms, I'm going to have to put him on medicine.  I talked to the vet the last time I was out there.  We're going to put him on medicine, 'cause he just shakes.  He just gets too scared.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  [NOISE] So ...  But I don't know.
R:  Well, I wish I knew more about current events, 'cause then I could talk about it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that current event in your area is jobs are hard to find.  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that without looking.
R:  Very, very --
L:  Know that without watching news or anything. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So, has your friend done some calls?
R:  Jen, have you done any call on this yet?  Or is this the first one?  No, this is the first one, she has --
L:  No, the first one.
R:  -- been 'cause she's packing. 
L:  She's packing?
R:  She's going to Florida.
L:  Oh, is she?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Leaving me behind.  
L:  [LAUGH] Just leave you there. 
R:  That's okay.
L:  She's going for a vacation or going for good?
R:  Going for your boyfriend for vacation.
L:  Oh. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well. [NOISE] So, how did she find out about the project, online?
R:  Yeah, on -- on Craig's List.  Do you guys have Craig's List there?  I know it's national. 
L:  What is it?
R:  Craig's List.  It's an internet site that you can post jobs at and -- is that where you found this from?  Yeah.  Um, you can post jobs and --
L:  I never heard of that one.  We have monster dot com.  And --
R:  Yeah, we have that too.  Um, but some of the big cities have Craig's --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's posted all over there. 
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] well, I got this one -- I be- -- I belong to a couple of, um, email groups on mystery shopping and they posted it on there.
R:  What do you do for mystery shopping?  Like, you just go round [NOISE] --
L:  You go to restaurants, you got to, ah -- I just did a subway, um, fast food tonight and I, um, [inaudible] drug store tonight.  You just go in and -- and do whatever they send you.
R:  [NOISE] That's cool. 
L:  Toward on their customer service.  It's a -- it's -- +interacting, though they pay you pretty good.  I mean, for your time that you're in there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just do a search -- the way I got started -- I just did a search --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, for mystery shopping and just started signing up for every --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- company that was listed.  And there's, like, thousands, thousands, thousands of them.  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  So, I just signed up for every one I could and they start sending me emails about jobs and you take 'em if you want to, if you don't want to, you don't take 'em.
R:  That's not a bad deal.
L:  Mm, mm.  A lot of places we get -- me and my husband go and eat, you get reimbursed for the meal and then you get a fee for doing the report online. 
R:  I'm going to check that out.
L:  So we get a lot of free meals. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's the way to go.  I should check that out in Boston.
L:  Yes, well, you also --
R:  It's expensive here.  
L:  -- get free groceries, get, you know, reimbursed for things at drug stores and department stores.  It's pretty high, so ...
R:  And you just typed in mystery shopping, like in Yahoo or something?
L:  Uh-huh, mystery shopping, on a search, yeah.  And then just start applying for every company -- don't ever pay anybody for any information -- some of them that'll say, "If you'll send me twenty four ninety five, well [inaudible] don't ever pay, there's too many free ones out there. 
R:  Good to know. 
L:  [NOISE] Yep.  It's interesting.  I started about two years ago -- that and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- merchandising.  Merchandising I go in and just do, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- set up displays or check displays or check products and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's all I do and I usually work [SIGH] well, I been taking on some extra work -- this is the busiest time of the year -- but normally I work three to four days a week, five to six hours a day, and make more money than I ever made sitting behind a desk, eight hours a day. 
R:  Yeah.  Nobody wants to do that.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I know I as sure as hell don't. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm, mm. No, it's a pretty good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a pretty good little opportunity. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, I might sign up. 
L:  Never knew it existed --  
R:  I'd heard --
L:  -- until a girlfriend --
R:  -- about it --
L:  -- of mine --
R:  -- but I didn't know how to even look for it.  
L:  [COUGH] Well, a girlfriend of mine moved from, ah, Tennessee to Mississippi and she got started in it.  And then she got me started in it.  That's what I was doing when the phone rang, I was on the computer, I'd gotten two more jobs and I was printing everything out and my husband came back and said, "Who's on the cell phone?"  I said, "It's one of my calls".  He said, "Good, give me the computer". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So he's on my computer.  I may never get him off. 
R:  How often do you get calls?
L:  Ah, you can only do three.  Um, this is my third one, so this'll be my last one. 
R:  Okay.
L:  And I -- I got a couple last week that I didn't take, because it was storming and I just didn't wanna be sit -- even though it's a cell phone, I still didn't wanna be on the phone. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I just didn't take 'em.  But, you know, you can only have three -- you get three calls originally and then some people they're contacting back to put you in a study for a longer time.  You'll get, like, twenty to twenty five calls over, you know, not -- a certain period of time. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't know.  I hadn't heard anybody that's gotten called back for that yet.
R:  [NOISE].
L:  So ...  But this'll be my last call, unless they decide to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- offer me more.  So ...
R:  Not a bad deal.  
L:  I can't even remember what the other two topics were about, isn't that horrible? [LAUGH] 
R:  I [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
L:  Ah, one was -- one -- the last one I had -- this -- ah, the one before this was what you, ah, looked for in your, ah, life companion. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What you thought was the most important, um, quality. 
R:  See, I can talk about that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The -- or something interesting ...
L:  So ...
R:  I don't know. 
L:  Yeah, well, when they call back if you don't want the topic, it'll tell you what number to push to not take it.  And they'll call you again. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  'Cause, like I said, they called me, like, probably two or three nights in a row and it was storming and I -- well, two nights it was storming, one night I had my little grandson --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he was in the bath tub.  I said, "No". [NOISE]  But they'll call back again. [NOISE]
R:  That's good --
L:  So ...
R:  -- to know.  Well, it's not my phone anyway, so Jen will --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- decide whether she wants to take it or not next time.  You can choose if you wanna take the top- --
