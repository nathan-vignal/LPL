R:  Hi, my name --
L:  Hi, I'm Laurie.
R:  My name's April.
L:  Ah, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you too. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I guess, um, we're supposed to talk about current events.  How we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep up with them.
R:  Yeah.  I usually -- I usually watch it on TV actually -- the news.  
L:  I do too and I get, um, I get quite a few of, um, the breaking news events to my cellphone because I travel quite a bit, so --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah --
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  For work.  I'm on the road most of the time but --
R:  A lot of the time.
L:  I usually -- I watch Fox at night most of the time when I get a chance.
R:  Yeah, the Fox News, right?  The --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The Network.  Yeah.  See we usually turn on CNN or [COUGH] something.  You know, w- if -- if it's something like the war that's been going on we turn on the, uh, the main news channels, you know, not just the evening news that usually comes on the regular channels but --
L:  Mhm.  Do you --
R:  CNN and things like that.
L:  -- ever read the newspaper?
R:  You know what?  I do.  But it's har- -- it's hard for me to sit and read the newspaper with -- I have a two year old, almost two and his big thing is tearing up the paper when I'm trying to read it so I try -- you know, I try to stay away from it because it's just -- it's too hard to do with him at the present time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I us- -- I used to, you know, but at this point I just don't so I usually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- turn on the, uh, you know, the network --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- news whenever I get a chance.
L:  Yeah, by the --
R:  'Cause they're always cover- --
L:   -- time I get around to the newspaper it's already -- it's not a current event any more. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's history by the time I get around to the newspaper.  But I do that.  I hear the breaking news on the -- on the radio sometimes.  Of course it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doesn't go too much in depth but [NOISE] --
R:  And then I get, uh --
L:  Unless you turn to NPR or something; one of the news shows but they're --
R:  Yeah, that's what I do like CNN 'cause then I could wa- -- like I could watch it at any point 'cause they pretty much run it pretty much the same things except for breaking news that's coming --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They run it over and over again so that's usually what I watch in order to get mine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That and I usually take -- I listen to other people's opinions on it but I don't -- you know, I don't -- I'm not the kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- person that usually gives too many opinions out about it.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I kinda say -- I kinda sit back and take it all in as to what -- what people were doing and what people are thinking about it, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And how -- how the economy's working with it which doesn't seem too well these days.
L:  Right.  Do you, um, do you keep up with [NOISE] just like the war and stuff or do you watch other current events --
R:  I wa- --
L:  -- like the --
R:  I w- --
L:  -- Laci Peterson case and things like that?
R:  Yeah, we watched -- I w- -- I actually followed that one for a while because I just wanted to see the outcome.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Some of the things that really catch my eye I sit there and I watch -- watch the news on and I -- it's -- it's not so much the war it's just anything that really will interest me, you know.  The, uh, Laci Peterson case I watched, you know, pretty adamantly to see what -- what was being discussed and, you know, what they were doing with the case.  Plus I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really enjoy kind of seeing --
L:  I think it's pretty -- I think it's pretty interesting.  I think   In a way --
R:  I -- I like to see how they solve them.
L:  -- I kinda feel bad for the guy because I think everybody pretty much has the opinion that he's guilty including the news.
R:  See and I -- I do so too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do too because like --
L:  That and then the Anandas[?] --
R:  -- I told my husband --
L:  The Smart -- Elizabeth Smart.  Did you keep up with that case? [NOISE] 
R:  Which -- who was -- now what one was that?
L:  That was the one that disappeared from her home.  The thirteen year old.
R:  The one with the congr- -- oh, no.  I -- I saw a little bit on that but I didn't see too much on it.  You know what I mean?  Because I -- like I said there's some days where I just -- with all the running around and stuff I can't get to actually watch every day, you know. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes I can't watch every day so I do go ahead and go to like the CNN for the bigger stories but I haven't --
L:  Right.
R:  I haven't really seen too much on -- I didn't see too much on that one.
L:  Do you ever go on line to check news? [NOISE]
R:  Not for news.  No.
L:  No?
R:  I usually do -- yeah, I usually just do the regular newscast and then the -- the main thing.  I mean, I'll s- -- you know, if I see something that's -- that's interesting linked -- linked to current events I'll -- I'll go on.  Like whenever they were doing the, um, the war -- war in Iraq or whatnot with the, uh, safety standards that you could do in your own home to be prepared for something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Then I -- I went ahead and I logged on 'cause it was on one of the government, uh, you know, internet sites.  It was like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was -- it was registered through the government and I did do that which, you know, I noticed   A- at any other point I probably -- I probably wouldn't have done that but due -- due to the fact of having a kid now I kinda tend to watch a little bit more on -- on those things.  So I did log on and -- and check out, you know, those -- those standards what they were saying on there to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be better prepared in case something happened but --
L:  Yeah.  Well, like CNN --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and most of the news stations it's the same thing every hour, so --
R:  Yeah, they run the same but then that's why I watch 'em because then if I miss something I can actually go ahead and get updated on it but that and, you know, some of the, uh   I know that we here have the Court TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that also deals with some of the cases after that news has ran it they'll go into the court proceedings on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes I watch a little bit of that but if it's long and drawn out I don't -- I don't, you know, watch too -- too much of it.  But you get -- you get kind of a better sense of what happened.
L:  Right.
R:  So I do watch -- I do watch some of that.
L:  Yeah, get the conclusion not just the big headline.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It really seems like well the -- the war it -- you're not seeing near as much of that now as you were [NOISE] a couple --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of months ago.
R:  Right.  There's still little inserts on the -- on your local news but not too -- too much, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- coming through.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, yeah, we, um, that and I -- I read some of the magazines on it too 'cause some of the magazine articles'll have them, you know.  Some of -- some of the bigger --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stories they'll have them in some of the magazines which I do watch those every once ...  I -- I watch for those inside of the, um, magazine articles and if there's something that interests me I'll pick one up in order to read on it.
L:  Yeah, they're pretty good about keeping up with the current -- the current stuff.  They'll --
R:  Yeah, and they give you the whole story all at once.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's kind of what I look for because the little tidbits here and there I end up missing something like.  You know what I mean?  Like, uh, [LIPSMACK] what was it?  The [SIGH] S- Sandra Levy case?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That I had caught and I was keeping up on it on our local news and then all of a sudden when, you know, the -- the war and everything else had started happening I didn't catch anything else.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't even know what happened with that; the ending, you know.  So, I try -- you t- -- you try to get it from other areas and -- but at that point y- you go even to the net- -- the network -- the big networks like CNN or something to catch it and they're no longer doing too much on that other than a little line along the bottom, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's like they kind of tend to focus on the main issue.  It -- it [inaudible].  In order to actually pick it up for me it's hard to do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's why I usually go ahead --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, catch it on the sh- -- on the programs.  It'll run it over same thing hour after hour because then I can at least catch up on it but [SIGH] [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] So, you get the information from your cellphone now.  Does it give you like the whole news --
L:  -- [NOISE] 
R:  -- story or does it just give you little inserts on it?  Are you still there?
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  Okay, I can't --
L:  Yeah, I've just gone through a bad area.
R:  Yeah, you're cutting out a little bit. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Can you hear me now?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, yeah --
R:  Sorry, what did --
L:  I live -- I'm -- was driving home from work and I kinda live -- I have to go over a lake and when I'm going over that lake I can't hear anything --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- for about three seconds and start to break up.  But do you -- do you just have the two year old?
R:  Yeah.  Just the two year old.
L:  How do you -- does she -- do you let your kid watch the news any or did they ever say anything?
R:  You know what?  At this -- at this point he doesn't understand it yet so he's i- -- he's in the room whenever we have it on. [COUGH] He's more interested in like if he sees like a fire truck or something on it.  You know, he'll watch that but he doesn't -- he doesn't pay much interest in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in like the actual adult shows.  So, I can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go ahead and watch it without him in the room.
L:  Right.
R:  Like I said, whenever he gets older and I don't want him to see that then I'll turn back to the newspapers because then, you know, at that point he'll be able to leave me go to read it.  You know what I mean?
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But at this point; yeah, that's what I do I just watch the news and he doesn't -- you know, he doesn't -- he doesn't even pay attention to the one that's on so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I'm capable of watching it no matter what the subject or the issue's on.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that works --
L:  Yeah, with mine I have to be more careful because they're older.
R:  Yeah.
L:  From ten to sixteen.  So   But they keep up with it pretty well.  I mean, you can ask 'em just about anything that's going on in current events and they [NOISE] -- they're keeping up with it.  They know what's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going on.  
R:  And they get -- they -- I assume that they get it from the news and probably school.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  The schools discuss it too.
L:  Oh, yeah, a lot of times they'll disrupt school to talk about the current events; put on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a news broadcast and then end up having to do a paper on it.  So --
R:  Mhm.  Well, that's good too --
L:  And it --
R:  And that keeps them involved and aware of what's going on.
L:  Yeah, and that's when they come home, "Do you have US News and World Report, or one of those magazines [LAUGH] because I have to do an article?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's amazing how much they -- they really do understand about what's going on.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, they --
L:  But I think most of it's from the news that they see at home because we do watch a lot of news programs, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we usually -- that's what I said once, you know, I'll have to monitor what, you know, what's seen and what isn't seen, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But like [MN] -- like I say the CNN ones don't go into too -- I -- I mean, with the war they did go into the graphic details of it but with -- with your --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- regular local stories, you know, where you'd have the guns or the shootings or, you know, whatever they don't play too much of that on CNN so that -- that's a little bit more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- convenient to get the -- the information from because they're not seeing so many bad images, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Except, like I say with the war they did do the images on those but, you know, compared to your local news it's -- it's less graphic on -- on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like a CNN or main news channel.  So --
L:  Right.  Does your husband keep up with the same events that you keep up with? [NOISE]
R:  He's all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into that stuff.  See he's -- he's more of the, um,
