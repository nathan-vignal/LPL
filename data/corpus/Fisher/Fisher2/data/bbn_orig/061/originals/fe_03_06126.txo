R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi.  My name is Samantha.
R:  Hi, uh, I'm Aaron.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, Aaron.  
R:  Uh, this is one of my first, uh, studies for the, uh [NOISE] --
L:  Okay.  Um, the topic is how --
R:  Right.
L:  -- do we do --
R:  Get news.
L:  Yeah, the current news.  I watch the headline news on Cable CNN Daily News.  What about you?
R:  Uh, usually first thing in the morning I go on to my office computer and get it from Yahoo News because that's really concise and it's up to date.  If you read the newspaper by the time it's in the newspaper it's old news and everyone else has it already.
L:  D- --
R:  And I don't have time to watch TV in the morning [NOISE] so I think the internet is fastest and for me it's most convenient.
L:  Yeah, well, um, [LIPSMACK] I --
R:  Pretty amazing the way it works these days.
L:  I have, um, [LIPSMACK] I get the CNN.  They gave me the daily news on the internet too but it's not really in full detail.  It's just basic -- like the little bits and pieces. [LIPSMACK] So, I basically get the news from anywhere.
R:  Yeah, y- y- you're right about that.  The, uh, internet gives you like, you know, the -- the headlines --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with a little bit to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fill it in.  But if you really want the, uh, in depth coverage you probably have to get the New York Times --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or the Wall Street Journal and, uh, [LIPSMACK] CNN of course, you know, has those great, you know, videos that you can't get anywhere else.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, if you wanna see the videos like the latest, you know, stuff of war coverage or something like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the place to go.  But, you know, it's a matter of having time to do all that whereas on the internet, you know, you just put it on and --
L:  Is it --
R:  -- in -- in one minute you got the gist of what's going on.
L:  Yeah, it's at your convenience.  Like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- whenever you wanna just sit there and just read.
R:  Right.
L:  Whereas when you gotta -- and I -- I understand what you're saying.  It's better to sometimes just sit there and read instead of the daily news and you gotta open it up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or whatever.  Yeah, but I -- I just like the news from anywhere I can get it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the -- so, first place I'd get it is the Daily News and then I'd get it from the, um, Cable CNN and headline --
R:  Right.
L:  Headline news and then I'd get it from on -- on the internet.  It's a lot of ways you can receive the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- news nowadays. [NOISE] 
R:  Of course the Daily News is great for the comics. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  On the Sunday I get the Daily News course --
L:  And --
R:  -- just for the comics.
L:  And the titles. [LAUGH] They have a lot of different titles.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] And --
R:  But, yeah. [COUGH] There is -- yeah, there's a lot of different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- places you can get the news these days.  
L:  How did you --
R:  It used to be just really have the newspaper which was al- always old or the, you know, Network News.
L:  Yeah.  I think they print the news like at night and then you get it in the morning.
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  First thing in the morning.
R:  And that's a little older than even that because they have to write it up first.  You know, and typeset it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, by the time you wake up in the morning, you know, and go to your store and get it it's already, you know, at least eight hours old.
L:  Yeah.  All the modern technology it's easy to get the news. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  So, how do you sh- -- go about sharing the news with people?
R:  Well, [SIGH] uh, usually I don't.  I mean, it's -- unless it's something really, really big happening like planes crashing into buildings --
L:  Ah.
R:  You know, that's not something that I have to like call people and tell something about.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And tell 'em about.  Uh, the last time I actually ever called people to let 'em know what's going on I guess was September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.  But you don't share the topics like the Daily News, you know, just like the weather for instance.  The d- -- the news is such a   You know, it's a conversational piece too.
R:  Oh, yeah, I -- I, you know, I talk about it but I don't like -- but I don't -- what I meant was that, you know, I don't like immediately call people up on the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- phone and tell 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what the news is because they could --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- read it as just like I can unless it's something like so urgent that, you know, affects everybody immediately and you've gotta make sure they know about it instantly because you have to act upon it.
L:  Yeah.  When it's like, "Duck".
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, yeah, like, "Duck.  Like you got a --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- a tornado coming".
L:  Yeah, yeah, understandable.
R:  But, you know, if it's just news like, you know, I don't know, the President is making a speech, you know, that can wait.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you know, or the Mets won the baseball game.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  That's not so urgent.
L:  I've found that in -- in the business world it's always good to keep up on the latest topics so, you know, like when you go to a meeting and you're at the awkward time; like at the beginning of meetings when you're sitting waiting for everybody to come, news is the best topic.
R:  Yes, it's like --
L:  Things to talk about.
R:  Friendly chit chat.
L:  Exactly.  It's friendly -- friendly chit chat to pass the time.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's always [NOISE] good to know your own point.  You don't wanna be sitting next to your boss [NOISE] when he +asks you something and you're like, "I don't know". [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  The worst thing is if your boss says something about some current event and you don't know that it happened and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you seem ignorant.  And you always wanna keep the appearance of being well informed.
L:  Exactly, 'cause then they wonder at, "Are you well informed on other things?"
R:  Right, right --
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you don't know the news then you probably don't know your job either then they think.
L:  It -- yeah, yeah.  'Cause I would probably be thinking the same thing too if I +asked somebody in a meeting.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Like, "What's going on with the stock?"  That's another good -- wait for the stock, you know, w- with big companies' bosses they like to know if you know [NOISE] what your stock is.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, you have to be careful though not to say anything controversial.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, you know, let's say you don't wanna say, "Gee I -- I see the President said this and he sure is wrong". 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That's like they say, "Avoid topics on politics and religion".
L:  So, do you, um, like your news during like meal time, dinner?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] I usually, uh, get the news in the morning when I get into my office; like eight thirty in the morning --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, then I'll --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- turn onto it like lunch time just to see if anything happened.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And then like before I leave the office.
L:  [NOISE] That's a good time too that I also discuss the -- the news, current events at the dinner table.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Well, I wanna try -- I try to keep my kids informed on what's happening.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause you --
R:  You know, 'cause kids these days they turn onto video games and cartoons instead of learning about what's going on in the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [inaudible] say, "Hey, do you know what happened today?"
L:  I know.  And they're like, "Uh, no". [LAUGH]
R:  "No".  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They say, "No, but Pokemon is really great". 
L:  I know, I -- yeah.
R:  Right, but that doesn't help 'em at all.
L:  Yeah, it [NOISE] -- news is -- is good.
R:  Right.
L:  It's -- it's always good to watch, you know, the -- to know what's going on around with your surroundings.  Um, [NOISE] I see the Enquirer; the Sunday Enquirer, they have a lot of like, I don't know, the Sundays papers is always so -- so big [NOISE] and it seems like it's not that much [NOISE] or there's too much information.
R:  Yeah, y- you pick and choose.
L:  Like everything coming at you at once. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, you pick and choose what you wanna look at.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What you wanna read.  You don't have to read -- you n- -- you're not required to read everything.  No one's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- keeping track of you.  So, I turn to like the front page in the index and see what's inside.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and just skip the stuff I'm not interested in.
L:  What is -- what is the first section that you go to in the -- in the --
R:  I go to the, uh, front news page.
L:  And [MN] -- um --
R:  You know, some people go to the sp- -- last page, the sports immediately.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but that -- that tells you a lot about people.  Like someone who goes to the sports before the news thinks that, you know, the latest baseball game or the basketball game is more important than anything else; whereas someone who reads the news first and then goes for the sports shows that he thinks that sports is just like an entertainment.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  So, not so important.
L:  Yeah.  When I, um, [LIPSMACK]   The first section I like to go to when I get the newspaper is my horoscope.
R:  Uh-huh, well, that's always amusing.
L:  Yeah, I like to be amused before --
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause sometimes the news can really like play on your --
R:  Well, that's -- yeah, it --
L:  Play on your day.
R:  Yeah, it can be very depressing.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Especially with like the latest kids who are kidnapped and --
L:  I know, it --
R:  -- the latest murder and homicide.  There's very rarely anything cheerful and uplifting.
L:  Exactly.  That's why I like to get a little smile before the boom.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] yes, I like to look through the horoscope first --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I go into the City Regent.  But, you know, I notice about like the Philadelphia Enquirer for the news, the City Regent is real small compared to like the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Daily News during the week.  You know what I'm saying?  In the Sunday paper, like the difference.
R:  Yeah.
