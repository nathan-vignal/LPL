R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name's Valerie.
L:  Hi, I'm Melissa.
R:  Hi, Melissa, how are you?
L:  I'm pretty good, how are you?
R:  Doing okay. [LAUGH]  I should be asleep but I'm doing okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I know how that is, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's pretty late here as well.  Um, [LIPSMACK], so current events.
R:  Yeah.  I have to admit it, I get most of my current events from friends.
L:  Really?  I'd say I'm pretty similar.  I don't -- I don't keep up on it that well.  You know, my boyfriend watches, um, a lot of the news stations like MSNBC and Fox.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.
L:  And so I kind of hear it from him because he's pretty political but, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I don't really seek it out, you know?  I don't really try to be up on current events, I kind of worry about myself more than what's going on.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, the thing is, I -- I ki- -- I wanna know what's going on but I cannot stand watching the news and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, so, I mean, actually [MN] if I'm gonna seek it out I'll listen to NPR --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the radio, um, you know.  And -- and my friend tends to listen to it a lot more than I do so she's my consult person, so I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I end up listening it that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I just -- I -- I don't know, I wanna know what's going on but I just don't have the patience.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  I mean, I definitely would like to know what's going on but, I don't know, sometimes I feel like I don't have time.  I -- I read it on the Internet actually, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Do you trust that?  I always wonder about that.  But I guess you can't really [LAUGH] -- you can't really trust anything but ...
L:  I would say though, the news stations are just as bad, you know.
R:  Yeah, I know, that's what I was just gonna say.
L:  I mean, anyone can lie.  Well, like the current, um, the guy from the New York Times, he got in trouble for forging and plagiarizing all those articles.
R:  [SIGH] I didn't hear about that, what happened?
L:  Yeah.  Um, there's some reporter who's, um, with the New York Times for a while and he got caught plagiarizing and, like, I guess making things up on multiple articles for like, years now.
R:  Oh my God.  [LAUGH] Jeez.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's the thing, I mean, the only thing that [MN] I have a hard time with is the fact that it's very -- I mean, as much as I like to say that they're, you know, objective, they're very biased, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So [MN] you watch the news program and -- and you know you're only getting one side of the story [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, and some are considered like, the liberal media and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some are considered the more conservative stations.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- I mean it seems interesting to find out, um, [LIPSMACK] which stations are broadcasting which views but honestly I wouldn't even have the time to watch those.
R:  Oh seriously, I know.  I know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can't believe we've got those -- those, um, those channels that are t- -- that are news all day long!  And that's just like, I can't imagine that.
L:  You know, I watched them when the war first broke out, I watched it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- continuously because I've had like, major insomnia, so I'd be up at like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- three, four in the morning, like, watching them.  And they repeat the same thing over and over.
R:  I know.  It used to drive me nuts.  My dad would watch, um, then news and he'd leave it on and of course we can't change it 'cause, you know, dad rules the house kinda thing.
L:  Totally.
R:  And, um, he would wanna watch the news and it's the same thing over and over and over.  I think that's the reason why I don't watch the news now, 'cause I just --
L:  Probably.
R:  -- can't stand it [LAUGH] anymore!  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, I'm really -- I'd say I'm really bad at keeping up on current events, so -- I mean, I have an idea of what's going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, all -- I'm on the Internet quite a bit so when the browser pops up, like MSN --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it'll have a few headlines.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if I see something that I really go, "Oh my God, what happened?" you know?
R:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  I --
L:  I'll check it out.
R:  I know what you're talking about, yeah, I do the same thing.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] but that's about it for me.
R:  Well, you know, I go through spurts, like I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, I will have no idea what's going on for like, a month.  And then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all of a sudden I'm listening to the news every day, you know, on the way to school or something, but, um, I don't know.  I mean, thank God my friends are actually interested in things like that 'cause they'll talk to me about it and I'll say, "Oh yeah, I --"  But then again, you know, it's like, I -- I'm getting sort of second, third, fourth hand news, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's okay, it keeps me informed.
L:  Kind of like when you play Telephone when you were a kid and it just --
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  I know.
L:  -- came out something totally different.
R:  Next thing I know, you know, the next thing I'm gonna hear is that Bush is wearing a tutu or something like that but --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, totally.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, I, um, I would say -- I -- I feel bad like, when someone mentions something though, like especially in a group setting and everyone's discussing it and I have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no idea what they're talking about.
R:  Yeah, I know, that is -- I know.  And I mean, it's -- it's embarrassing too to -- to admit that you don't know, you know, 'cause you're thinking that you should actually know -- especially if it's, you know, important politically or something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  But it also seems like there [SIGH] -- most people I talk to are very busy people.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I would say the average person probably gets their news from the radio, like while commuting to and from work.
R:  Oh sure, yeah.  In the morning news or something.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I work really odd hours so I don't hear the news in the car.  I really only turn the news on in the car when, um, when I'm on the roads trying to find out traffic.
R:  Yeah, I know! [LAUGH]
L:  So I get the headlines --
R:  [LAUGH] I understand that.
L:  I get the headlines as well when I'm finding out traffic --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but -- I mean, I'm actually -- now that I think about it, I've been on a three hour car ride and listened to the news almost the whole time but it was the same stuff over and over again.
R:  It is, yeah, I know.  It's really weird.  Um, oh, shoot, I was gonna say something, I can't what it was.  It had something to do with the radio I think.  Or [MN] -- oh, you know, it's funny though is that like, most of the current events that we hear in most of the headlines are --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about, you know, like big, you know, federal government kinds of things that actually, you know, our state local government kinds of things have [MN] -- have a bigger impact on our lives but we never hear about that stuff.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I've come to [several inaudible words] as well.  I mean, we hear in [LIPSMACK] -- are you in California or where are you?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I'm in California.
L:  I mean, we kind of hear, you know, like, "Oh, the governor's doing this" --
R:  Right.
L:  But really not that much.  I mean, I'm -- I'm in the San Francisco area and we get a little bit of [MN] local stuff but not -- not that much, and I don't -- I wouldn't say I really keep up on it anyway, so --
R:  I know, I know, that's the thing is, that -- if -- if I'm going to keep on m- -- k- keep up on anything it's not -- I'm not gon- -- 'cause I'm, um, I'm at USCB and it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm not gonna keep up on stuff that's, you know, Santa Barbara but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'll pay attention to the stuff that's, you know, maybe some California stuff, but definitely federal stuff.
L:  See, and I -- I just lived in San [inaudible] where there is no news.
R:  Right, yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  It's like --
R:  That's true!
L:  -- "Oh, the local town got a new fire hydrant today".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's like, okay.
R:  That's so true!  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah, so what's going on with the war, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Things like that.
R:  That's a good point.
L:  How funny.
R:  Well especially with the war going on, like you said, it's, uh, I've been more apt to listen to -- to the news and find out what's happening.
L:  Definitely.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I know, I had friends over there and things like that so I was definitely like --
R:  Oh God, I bet.
L:  -- trying to find out, okay what's going on?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But still, I mean, they don't keep you that well informed.  Actually, sometimes they keep you too informed though, 'cause I remember listening to the news and they were like, "We're located at blah blah blah".
R:  I know!
L:  And I'm like, "What the hell are you thinking?"
R:  I --
L:  "You think these people don't watch the news?" [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I'm thinking, i- is that r- -- I -- I really, the whole time they were doing the war coverage I'm thinking, you know, there's some stuff I really don't think we need to know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I totally belief in the power of the press and -- and the freedom of the press and all of that jazz but I just -- there's some stuff we don't have to know and -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, but yeah.
L:  When it's a matter of national c- security people need to shut up and just let --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- people do their thing.  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  Exactly.  You know [MN] --
L:  Yeah, I'm always concerned about that.
R:  The one thing that bothers me is that, I mean, it's totally filtered, what we hear.
L:  [MN]
R:  And I know there's stuff going on the world that would just blow my mind --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh definitely.
R:  -- but I'm never gonna hear about that, I'm never gonna hear about that, so --
L:  You know, before the war started I was listening to a, uh, a program and he -- it was a very, very conservative, um, news -- not a news but he's kinda like a discussion -- like a Sean Hannerdy[?] type.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, he basically said like, "We already dropped a bomb on Iraq" and I was like, "What?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, and then I turn on the news, I'm like, "Okay, okay, no, no, no" and this was probably like, ten days before the war started.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, um, you know, I -- I never heard about it on the news.
R:  Right, you don't.
L:  So now I'm like, "Okay, did it happen?  Did it not happen?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was saying that like, the British press was like, reporting it, or something crazy like that, so ...
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know.  I- it's kind of weird, I wonder what we hear and what we don't hear --
R:  I know.
L:  -- 'cause it seems like we hear too -- it's almost like they try and give us what we think is too much information, so --
R:  So that --
L:  -- that they can kind of cover up what we're not hearing --
R:  W- yeah.
L:  -- so we don't ask.
R:  Yeah.  That's a good point.  That's a good point.
L:  Yeah.  Scary. [LAUGH] 
R:  It would [MN] -- it would be nice if news was not -- if news was news for the sake of news instead of news being news for the sake of money.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're always trying to sell -- sell their story or make it, you know -- all those cliff hanger kinds of things, you know, "What happened in the news today?" kinds of stuff.  So --
L:  Sensationalizing everything.
R:  Yeah.  I hate that.  So --
L:  +Yeah, it is pretty ridiculous. [LAUGH]  Um, yeah, I'm surprised by that.  And it -- like I said, it is funny how different stations report things different ways.
R:  Yeah, it is, it's really funny.  I know -- I -- you know, 'cause like I said, I listen to NPR, which is -- is fairly liberal and then the -- the Santa Barbara, um, the college is station is -- is really liberal, you know, so then I'd -- I'd hear it, what's happening, on the TV, then I
