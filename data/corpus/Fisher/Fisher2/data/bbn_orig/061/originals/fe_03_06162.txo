L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello? [NOISE]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  This is Marilyn, I'm calling from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'm -- my name's Nicole and I'm come -- calling from Oklahoma and for some reason that sounds really familiar.
R:  Oh, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada?
L:  No.  You're name. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, my name! [LAUGH]  Well --
L:  [NOISE] And where you're from, that put together.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I only had one call that I've done, um, about a -- about a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- week ago.  This is my second call actually.
L:  Are you on Lila's Lounge?
R:  Th- this is your first?
L:  No, are you on, um -- do you do mystery shopping?
R:  Yes, did we not talk before then?
L:  I don't know then.
R:  We must have.  Are you with horses?
L:  No, I'm --
R:  Or you -- you ha- --
L:  No, I'm -- I'm on Lila's Lounge.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  So how -- how -- well, how do I sound familiar?
L:  I don't know but you do .
R:  Well, you know, I -- I've done mystery shopping so that -- that's true.
L:  I wonder, are you on -- are you on any Yahoo groups?
R:  Uh, the Delphi Line, the Delphi Forum.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Possibly that's -- that's, I guess --
L:  That may've been it.
R:  Yeah, yeah, so okay. [LAUGH];
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, topic I guess is talking on current events and how do we keep up with current events?  So, myself, I have, um -- well, I have the TV on, I have the news on all the time, especially in the evening because I work throughout the day so, um, when I'm home and I'm -- when I'm on the computer that's when I have, uh, the TV on [SIGH] and, uh, I think it's important to keep involved in current events and what's happening, you know, throughout the world.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.  And how about yourself? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it kinda depends on what, um, exactly I'm doing, like ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Some of it, I mean, I don't really watch the news much, just because it's -- I just don't like the news, they kind of sensationalize everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't really -- I mean, I can tell you what's going on but my information comes from different places, like my grandma will tell me she saw something on the news and like as far as the war in Iraq and stuff goes, I -- I, um, talk to, um, some friends of mine to get that information -- the information there.  And so I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, about the only time I really watch the news is I watch our local news for here in the state --
R:  Right.
L:  -- usually at night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, but that's about it.  I don't really watch like, MSNBC or, you know, Fox News or any of those.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And well, I guess it depends on the person and how involved they get in, you know, like you're saying, in -- in the world's events or what have you.  I listen to, um, the current events that happen in our local city as well.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, when you here about any murders or, you know, any bank robberies or whatever, the, you know, deaths or whatever the news is, um, and then I always after that put it on for the world news just to see the updates of how --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the war is going on, whether some Afghan[?] --
L:  See, my husband's -- my husband's over there so I kinda --
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, so I've -- I kinda know -- I find out about that pretty easy.
R:  Oh.  Oh, that -- that must be pretty stressful then, isn't it?
L:  No. [SIGH]
R:  No.  Oh! [LAUGH]  Yeah, well, I guess it's -- I mean, they're there for peace anyway, right?  So it's, um -- I think basically the war in Iraq is winding down -- down now anyway, I just hope they find him.  You know, Saddam Hussein, so [LIPSMACK] -- yeah, so, um, other than that I -- I guess I also listen to the news when I'm on my way to work, through the radio.  So I guess that would be my first, um, way of finding out what's happening, is -- is through radio.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm on my way to work in the car.  Um, and that's it.  Then you're at work all day and that -- that's it, nothing until evening again, so --
L:  See, I just -- I don't -- I guess unless it affects me directly I don't care too much, and I know that sounds kind of coldhearted but ...
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, I don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  Like, the Lacy Peterson case, I know people that can tell you every single detail of it and yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that -- that was what -- and I don't know if you have any idea of what I'm talking about or not --
R:  Actually I do because I -- I was like that quite a few years back too.  It's like, it's depressing, it don't wanna hear it, I don't want nothing to do with it, it has nothing to do with me and I just didn't wanna hear much of what all was happening in the world because it normally didn't affect us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I guess now it seems to be affecting us more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, with terrorism, it sounds like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everyone's involved and affected so I -- I basically do like to know now what's going on, just so I can prepare myself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, not be in major shock when and if something does happen.  So, uh, but yeah, I know exactly where you're coming from 'cause I was like that before too, if people talked about the news it was like, boring [LAUGH] no, like, let's talk about going to a show or, you know, going dining out or, you know, doing something that, you know, you have an interest in doing, but I was, you know, there before too, where I had no interest whatsoever in the news.
L:  Yeah.  And I think they just -- I mean, they act like if they talk about it, you know, a certain number of times or whatever, that ...
R:  Yeah, it -- it -- it's repetitive.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's like they're not really telling anything new and they just act like it's the worse thing in the world and you're just kinda like, "Okay".  I mean, and it is a bad thing but talking about it constantly isn't gonna change anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I said, I lived in Oklahoma and what, four years ago we had the Oklahoma City bombing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And for three weeks straight that's all that was on on TV.  That's it.  All of the shows, you know, like, Survivor and everything, all that stuff was canceled, all they covered for three weeks straight was about the bombing.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it just got -- and I went to it [NOISE] as e- -- as emergency personnel and it just got to a point [NOISE] where I was like, "I'm tired of hearing about it, let's do something else". [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know?  And it just -- it just drove me crazy and I think that's where I'm at to a point with, you know, everything else, the war and everything, it's just I've heard [NOISE] so much about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I'm just kinda like [NOISE] -- yeah, it's a sad thing and I wish it wasn't going on 'cause I wish, you know, my husband and his friends and the friends of ours could come home but it's going on and talking about it, you know, to death isn't going to change what's happened.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It -- it can make it actually more depressing too, you know.  And -- and I guess a person has their own problems to deal with as well, so this is just more adding onto other problems, so yeah, that -- that's how I felt, you know, um, like I was saying, years back too, is, you know, there -- there's too much going on right now, I don't wanna deal with what's going on when, you know, you had your own scenarios to deal with.  But I -- I don't know, just -- just now I -- I just -- maybe it's because I'm on the computer all the time so I have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the TV on.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  And it's not like I actually get home to turn the news on.
L:  Right.
R:  It's -- it's just like I -- I work all day and then like you were saying in the evenings I'm out doing my mystery shops, and so then when I get home when the stores close at nine o'clock, I'm doing my shops up 'til midnight or one o'clock what have you, so I have the -- the news on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and, uh, I guess it's because I've had it on so often it -- it's -- it's almost addicting to, well, what's gonna happen next?  What's -- okay, what, you know, what's gonna happen tomorrow?  What's gonna happen the next day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and so on and so on.  So I -- I probably wouldn't be that involved in the news if I wasn't on the computer.  And --
L:  Well, see, even -- well, like, right now, well, when the phone rang and I was in the chat room talking with some other wives and in there, you know, they talk about -- they -- they [NOISE] talk about what's going on in the news but not a lot.  I mean, you know, like last night they said something that they found out about Lacy Peterson [NOISE] or whatever, but other than that we just kinda dropped it.  I mean, [NOISE] we don't ... I don't know.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess it's just a coping mechanism --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that because I'm -- I'm so close to a- a lot of stuff that goes on in the news, like I said, I was one of the emergency personnel that went to the Oklahoma City bombing, I had reservations and stuff to go to the World Trade Towers if they'd found more survivors. [NOISE]  Austin, stop.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's just so close to me that I don't watch it that much. [NOISE]
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, well that -- that's quite interesting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really watch or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- participate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in any news online.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, because we're busy doing other things --
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  -- online, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um -- although it's there for us, I -- I don't really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I c- -- I can't really say I've gone into the news.  I guess I have at work because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we don't have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the TV there so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a person can go to the New York Times or to the local news and -- and see what's happening if they wanted to, um, at that point.  But, uh, nah, I don't really do that really at work, just because you're busy doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your job, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Well, I don't have a real job so --
R:  Well, you do, you're -- you're at home.  [LAUGH]  You know, that -- that's probably more of a job than anything, looking after children, right?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  I do mystery shopping and merchandising.
R:  You -- you do, yeah.  I'm still trying --
L:  And that's it.
R:  -- to think how you know me and I don't know you.  So --
L:  I don't know but just for some reason your name and where you're from just sounds familiar and I'm not sure why.  Austin, stop.
R:  Yeah.  So, what is your name?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, but -- I just -- I don't know, I mean, I just think that everybody lives their life too much around the news.  I know people that the first -- that's the first thing they do [NOISE], that they -- they turn on the [NOISE] news when they get up and that's the last thing they do at night, is they turn [NOISE] off the news right before they go to bed.
R:  Right.
L:  And they just [NOISE] -- they memorize everything they say. [NOISE]  And they just -- they live in such a [NOISE] -- a negative world all the time [NOISE] that k- all they talk about is [NOISE] the bad stuff that's going on in the world that they don't see to have very much joy in their life and I just -- I don't wanna be like that, you know, I don't wanna focus on all the negative, I wanna focus on my life and get my life where I want it to be and then, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when the world -- when the world, um, what happens in the world affects me I'll deal with it at that point in time.
R:  Yeah.  When it happens then of course you're gonna deal with it.  Which is true too because I think it's like anything, a person can get carried away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, they can watch too much TV, whether it's the news or, you know, soap operas, they can get carried away with that too, right?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  And -- and it takes away from their personal life.  It -- it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's fine to -- to watch local -- to maybe watch the news but not to dwell on it, like you're saying.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, because people like they do, they get
