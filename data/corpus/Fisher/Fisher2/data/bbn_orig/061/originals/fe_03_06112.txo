R:  Hi, my name is Corey.
L:  Hi, ah, let me put, ah, my call waiting off. [NOISE] Okay, Corey?
R:  Hi.  [inaudible] 
L:  Hi.
R:  What is your name?
L:  Frances. 
R:  Hi, Frances, how are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you?
L:  An- and you live in where?
R:  I live in Georgia.
L:  Okay, and I live in Lovo[?], Kentucky. 
R:  Oh, so you're not too far away.
L:  Right.
R:  Nice place [inaudible], I like it a lot. 
L:  It's a nice town. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, how --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- do you get your current events?
R:  Well, this is the probably asking [inaudible] question for me, because I'm in -- I'm in journalism. [LAUGH] I work in television news, so ...
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  I, yeah, so my whole life is surrounded by the media [LAUGH] and news and information and from the minute I wake up in the morning, I'm listening to NPR, National Public Radio.  Um, also, ah, the minute I get into work, getting updates from our sources on various stories around the world and constantly reaching -- reading the news wires [inaudible] and, ah, news services, ah, web sites, CNN dot com and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yo- you name it, I'm -- it's my life, and it has been --
L:  That's very interesting.
R:  -- for fifteen years. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you probably --
R:  So --
L:  -- don't even read the newspaper.
R:  Well, I do read a few newspapers.  I -- I like reading the New York Times.  I -- sometimes read the Atlanta Constitution, not too much though.  Ah, Wall Street Journal I enjoy a lot, especially for business news --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I do read all the magazines too, [inaudible] Time, Newsweek. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  So, it's --
L:  Well, I always turn --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] 
L:  -- the TV on first thing in the morning and catch up --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on what went on overnight. 
R:  Okay.
L:  But I read the paper every day, too. 
R:  Do you?  First thing in the morning, or later in the day, or ...?
L:  Oh, [MN] depending on what my schedule is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I have -- now today, I haven't had time to read the paper yet.  But, ah, you know, I've watched it on the news, but I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- seldom turn the radio on. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, radio has a lot of junk on, I think.  A lot of those talk shows that are -- people babbling. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but I do like to keep up, ah, on the news and, ah, tomorrow's our elections day, so, um --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I like --
R:  -- [inaudible] election?
L:  Um, the primary.
R:  Mhm.
L:  For the governor and of -- of Kentucky and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- different offices like that.
R:  So, you'll be listening, ah, to the local stations about all the issues and --
L:  Right, plus re- reading the paper [COUGH] about the candidates and, um, trying to make up my mind [LAUGH] before I get there. 
R:  Yeah, I think there's over saturation in the media now.  There's too much information sometimes. 
L:  Right.  Do you feel that it, ah, the war was covered well in the media?
R:  Um, yes and no.  I think it's a tough situation when you have -- the only information you are getting is from journalists who are out there with the US military --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so you're getting one perspective of it. 
L:  Oh --
R:  I think this journalists is -- does, you know, as good a job as they can under the conditions.
L:  Right. 
R:  But I think they're -- there's so much now in terms of the aftermath of the war that people lose interest in.
L:  Right.
R:  And I fault the media in that, in not presenting it right.  They always say, "Oh, the American people are [inaudible] -- they're not smart".  And I -- I don't -- I think the American people are a lot more intelligent than people given them credit for.  And, ah, I think the American people are -- if things are presented to them in a -- in a correct manner, they would care about international news more.
L:  I think that's true, too.  Although I do believe that some people are inclined to bury their heads in the sand.
R:  Mm, that's --
L:  And --
R:  -- true, there's always those people. 
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I do enjoy keeping up with things.  
R:  That's good. 
L:  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause it's e- -- it'd be easy, I guess, not to, but, um, and course we ne- -- we need current events with the -- all the bad weather we have.
R:  Yeah, it's practical.
L:  Yeah, have you had some, ah, severe weather there?
R:  Well, we have, but not as severe as, you know, tornado alley, um --
L:  Right.
R:  I went that Sunday when all the bad storms were happening.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was flying from Minnesota to Atlanta and it was a real bumpy ride.  It wasn't until I landed I realized what we were flying over and I was, you know, thanking the Lord that [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] to that degree.  But we get, you know, this past couple of months, we've had some really bad hail storms.  Ah, I've seen other people -- not, thank God, not on my street -- but in the Atlanta area where there are, you know, their --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- their homes and cars were destroyed by trees just falling from the wind, and --
L:  Yeah, it's been pretty bad.  
R:  Pretty ba- -- how about in Louisville?
L:  Ah, we've been fortunate.  I mean, we've had some bad, ah, storms, but there's been no touchdowns or -- or real damage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We kind of live in a valley, so we --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do miss a lot.  
R:  Now, the current events that I like to hear about are the, ah [NOISE] the great races that you have there, the Kentucky Derby. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, yeah.  That was just, ah, last week, the week before last --
R:  Yeah, two weeks ago.  And the horse that won the Derby won in the pre [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but he hasn't started the Triple Crown. [LAUGH] 
L:  So he has one more chance, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hopefully -- hopefully, he'll get there.  
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Do you write in any of the, ah, current events in your job?
R:  I'm not a writer, um, I write questions for our, um, interviewers that are on air to ask on the air.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I'm more in management and making decisions on what to cover.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But it's always a battle because I work more with international news and all they ever want to show is, like, the bad stuff. 
L:  Oh, oh, well, yeah, that's what people wanna see, I guess. [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, I mean really, you know, they -- they put out those little, ah, teasers of -- during the day, so you'll watch eleven o'clock news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever.  But you --
R:  But it --
L:  -- like your job?
R:  Oh, yeah, I do.  I do.  I've been doing it so long though, it's like anything else, [MN] you think, "Oh, well, is there anything else I should be doing with my life?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But overall, I -- it's the profession I always wanted to do.  And I like being informed and on top of things and meeting interesting people and, ah --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- that's the --
L:  But -- 
R:  -- exciting part of it.
L:  So, do you get any current events, like, from other people?  I mean, you know, like in the beauty shop, I know we have a lot of people discuss what's going on --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- in -- in the beauty shop.
R:  Yes, because of the nature of my job, which is lining up a lot of the interviews, I get to speak with people and they tell me different perspectives.  Like, during the war I was speaking with Arab journalists and they were giving me their take on the situation, which is a totally different perspective.
L:  Imagine.
R:  It's so -- yeah, so that was kinda interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, and people are always giving me a tip.  You should be careful about some of them. [LAUGH] You have to check your facts. 
L:  Oh, yeah, 'cause you could get in big trouble, huh?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I just had that Jason Blair who --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- was in the --
L:  I know.
R:  -- New York Times [inaudible].
L:  I can't --
R:  Terrible.
L:  -- believe -- I can't believe that he got by as long as he did doing that. 
R:  Pretty scary that he got by like that.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Looks like --
R:  And now he's going to write a book. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, he's going to write a book, so [LAUGH] he'll probably --
R:  He'll get rich [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm --
R:  Pretty bad.
L:  Ah, I'd be scared to death to do that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Last [inaudible] --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- got a lot of journalists out there doing that.
R:  [several inaudible words] Now, your family, do they also watch the news quite a bit?
L:  Oh, well, they work.  I -- I don't think so.  I think my -- my children and grandchildren are more interested in the entertainment programs.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And one of my sons, I know he reads the paper every day.
R:  What about entertainment news, like, ah, Entertainment Tonight, that sort of stuff?  They -- they like that?
L:  Oh, yeah, they -- they would watch that.  And then course the guys always read the sports.  It's funny how -- how we divide the paper, you know, all of us.  I -- I --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- throw the sports out immediately. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I do.  I don't read the sports. [LAUGH] 
R:  Sure.
L:  And, um, the classified, I throw it out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I --
R:  So, you -- so, you overall like the local news the best?
L:  I do.  And of course when you get to be my age, you read the obituaries. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no, you --
L:  Early.
R:  -- sound pretty young.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't notice, you know, there's more people die, I guess, aro- -- my friends have been passing away off --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- and on, so I do always read that.
R:  Sure.
L:  And --
R:  I had to laugh the other day, I looked in the obituary column and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they had a picture of a young man, like, twenty years old.  I said, "Oh, my goodness, what happened?  How tragic".  And then I read closer and the man was born in nineteen twenty and it was just his old picture.
L:  People are doing that, I noticed that too.  I guess --
R:  I wonder why?
L:  -- they want to look their best. [LAUGH] 
R:  I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it -- it sort of scared me as a journalist, I thought, "Oh, my God, did the [inaudible] get murdered or what happened?"  And then you read the story and it's --
L:  See, I don't know if people --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the family's doing that or if the person has requested --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, um --
R:  But don't read too much of the obits or it'll depress you. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I just -- I don't.  I just read through to see if it's anybody I know and then ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Sure.
L:  And then I let it go, 'cause I wouldn't want to miss that, I mean if it was somebody I really cared --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about.
R:  Now, how did you learn about the, um, University of Pennsylvania?
L:  On the --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- internet.
