R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello, this is Janet.
L:  Oh hi, this is Melody.
R:  Hi, Melody --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- how are you doing?
L:  Okay.
R:  Well I'm glad to be able to talk to you.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Now, the --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- topic was, where we got most of our information from?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  I think on -- on, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, just what cur- current events.
R:  Yes, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Whether it was ra- -- I guess radio, TV or people or [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, or newspapers.  Uh --
L:  Mm.
R:  I'd have to say mine is probably equally divided between newspapers and, uh, the television news.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's about, um -- 'cause I get s- some on the [SIGH] -- the news and I -- I would think probably, you know, even more just, uh, with the -- with the newspaper.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Occasionally talking to other people but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, or me.
L:  O- only --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if it's -- i- i- it's a kind of a the -- the same thinking can you have much of a [NOISE] -- a, you know, kind of discussion or something, but it, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, but I can't think of any, um, oh, let's see. [SIGH]  Uh, well, and sometimes radio.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  Some -- you -- you know, you get the little blurbs, you know, from the five minute news in the morning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] That's what I get on --
L:  That's --
R:  -- my way to work and I guess you mostly get the highlights.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, uh, to you get more indepth coverage I'd probably say -- well, uh, probably the newspaper 'cause you can probably have a little bit more time, you know, to actually read and digest --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- what -- what's in the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- newspaper.  And then sometimes the news, I guess it, you know, it can still be the reporter's, you know, sort of point of view, even though I think maybe they try to be unbiased, but, you know.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]  True.
R:  We -- we all are biased I guess a little bit more than --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we wanna say. [LAUGH] 
L:  E- especially when someone's got their -- their own show, you know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.
L:  I- some of these guys and they -- and they just, uh, and, you know, it's all from their perspective because they -- they either attack certain, you know, um, people that are in the [SIGH] -- in the, uh, public view, you know, or -- or, um, [LIPSMACK] or something along that lines, so that it definitely gets kinda -- kinda slanty 'cause it -- it is their forum and their show, you know?
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Let's hope they don't have too big of a head about it. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true. [SIGH]
R:  But then again you can get that from the newspaper, from the reporter writing what he wants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or she wants to write too.
L:  That's -- yeah.  That's true.  Or if they have a little b- byline or -- or something where it's just a little more -- but it, uh -- yeah, and it would be from their per- perspective 'cause that's just human nature, you know [LAUGH], you just [LAUGH].  But, uh, yeah, I do, I get a little bit in the -- in the morning when my clock radio goes on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and gets some of the -- the highlights.  And then, uh, if I'm out during the day I -- I get, um, uh, oh like they'll be two, um, male commentators, you know, with their --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- own radio show and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they just start in on everybody, you know, [LAUGH] it's always --
R:  Oh yeah, now that --
L:  [inaudible], yeah.
R:  -- that -- that could be extremely biased. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, whatever the latest murder is or something that's high profile or there's something like that they're, you know, they're all over 'em.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So -- so it, um, so I thought -- boy, I don't know, you know, on the half you don't know whether you can believe what they're saying or whether it's just their -- their, uh -- their own comments and --
R:  Yeah, like -- like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] that, you know, it's however they want to present it and they can present it in a positive or a negative light.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, yeah, that's so true.  It just -- I mean, it could like, even read -- read the same, you know, information off a sheet of paper and [LAUGH] just by -- by, uh, their -- their attitude of reading it, you know, it can, uh, can just put a whole different light on it so it --
R:  Mhm.  And then, you know, a lotta times --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when you do get your news and, you know, if you go to work or if you're talking to friends or whatever then --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- you seem to -- to [MN] take it and analyze it, you know, and -- and have your own viewpoint or their own viewpoint, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like I said, it -- it gets -- it gets all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- screwed. [LAUGH]
L:  Sorta mixed up.  And then you're going, "Gee, what was the original story I heard this morning on the news?" you know, and it's just [SIGH] -- it does, it gets, uh, pr- pretty altered, so it, uh -- as I say, you almost get down to where you -- you just don't know what the truth is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I thought [MN] no wonder some of these juries, you know, get all -- all the, you know, see the information presented to 'em and they're -- by the time they finish, I mean, you can't get twelve people to hardly agree, you know?
R:  That's true.  I guess, you know, [inaudible] gets into, you know, uh, you know, I don't know, it's just like a -- I was just -- I was trying to think of something else and I lost my train of thought.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Like I said --
L:  I know, I --
R:  -- you know, [MN] it can get biased and -- and we all have our own biased opinions too even though --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- we say we don't but, you know, we have certain ways we feel but other people --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- also will, uh, you know, change our way of thinking I guess and ...
L:  True.  True.  It just -- I know, and it just [MN] -- and I always think too of what, uh, gee, I don't know, who was it?  [MN] S- uh -- whose statement it was that a -- a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] You know?  And I thought, you know, that's awfully true, you know, it's like [LAUGH] -- I mean, it just takes a lot to, uh, kinda change someone's mind assuming that they want it changed, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it is, it's just, uh --
R:  But I sometimes, you know, my -- my pinky can be swayed if somebody has a different viewpoint, you know.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, because --
R:  Especially if it's something I'm sitting on the fence about.  I mean, I guess --
L:  True.
R:  -- there is certain things in the way we were raised that, you know, we're pretty dogmatic about certain things but then --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- I would say to you like, "Well, I didn't think of it that way?" you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  And that's a different point of view too.
L:  That's --
R:  And then of course there's other people who you can sway 'em, you know, th- they -- they're swayed all the time.
L:  Uh, yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, or --
R:  It's -- it's according to who they're talking to.
L:  -- whichever way the wind is blowing [LAUGH], they go that way.
R:  Yeah, that is exactly right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  And it's like they --
R:  They're always on the fence --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- playing one side or to the other. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true.  They never really had a -- an opinion, they thought, "Well, whatever one comes by.  Oh, that sounds good, I'll go with that one". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or -- or they do it just to, you know, to keep you happy.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  [MN] Yeah.  Yeah.  To not have a -- an -- or an altercation or something and they just go with the -- the line of least resistance.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  That's true.  [inaudible] --
R:  And I don't know, sometimes you think --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I know people like that who are out -- like, I work with, and I'm like, "You -- you'll agree with anything, you know, at the moment --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- But then again if you get with someone else, you know, you'll be the opposite way" --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I guess that bothers me they won't take a stand on, you know --
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  -- what they wanna believe in.
L:  Well, I guess more so maybe like in an office environment, you know, with people that you have to see every day and work with, that you don't wanna like, get on anybody's wrong side, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That isn't [SIGH] --
L:  And ge- -- and get a -- a disagreement going and then it seems like, you know, feathers kinda get ruffled and stuff and then it -- it, uh, makes sort of a little -- a -- a -- a cold atmosphere, you know?
R:  Yeah, that's true, on that --
L:  So it, uh --
R:  And sometimes you know, it's w- i- -- when you work with people the, you know, five days a week and eight hours a day, you're with them --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- more than you are your own family. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that the truth.
R:  So -- so you have to be real --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- careful, like you said, with -- with the office politics.  I -- I guess we all do it to some degree. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like you -- you kinda say something and then when it starts to get a little heated then you're going, "Okay, well let's change the subject" [LAUGH] you know, it's like [SIGH] -- 'cause you d- -- yeah, 'cause you do when you have to work with them all the time it's just, uh, th- they could get uncomfortable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's just, uh -- I said no wonder they -- they say it's not good to have dating in -- in the office, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  I w- --
L:  'Cause you gotta see those -- see that same person all the time when things don't go right, you know?
R:  Yeah, I -- I have actually had that situation with a -- a supervisor and a co worker, were --
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  -- um, dating and, um, [LIPSMACK] it can get real sticky. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But they did eventually get married so that's [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  That was a good thing. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's --
L:  Yeah, 'cause I could just see how it would go if they -- if things didn't, you know, go well, and then it's like, y- you know, the tension that would be there would just be kinda [SIGH], I know --
R:  Oh, and -- and the people --
L:  -- just hard to deal with.
R:  -- that try to, you know, yeah, ho- -- well, you know, "Well what's going on with them?" and, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "Isn't it awful?" and you're like, you know, "I'm stuck in the middle". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And you think, "I don't wanna get into this discussion here" you know, it just -- and then everybody's taken sides and -- and you're trying not do that and -- yeah, I would think it would get kinda -- kinda sticky. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it can get kind of sticky.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think we got a little way from the a- actual point of the discussion, which was --
L:  [LAUGH] I know!  It just [LAUGH] --
R:  But I was going, "Well, I think, you know --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- we sorta covered that in the first couple of minutes". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  It's just when I thought, well, let me see, I -- I don't -- I'm trying to think of how you could put a little bit of the, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, commentaries that you hear something, what that has, you know, [MN] fit that into the office, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I thought, well, I don't know, I don't unless -- unless it's like a newspaper office or something, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, uh --
R:  But then, I'm sure they get -- that they have their own little office politics too and I guess also --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- that, y- you know, you think about it even on a news station --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- or in a -- a newspaper or how well your maybe liked or dislike can get, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, you get you a sign I guess --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- certain stories of whether you'd be on the front page or the middle of the newspaper --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I've never -- really ever think about that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Or whether they stick you on the last page. [LAUGH]  [inaudible] somewhere on the bottom or something, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, some little blurb --
L:  [SIGH] [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, I guess that that comes into play too.
L:  Yeah, gosh.
R:  It's just sort of a never ending cycle, isn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really.  It just -- yeah, I think that would be a -- a difficult job to have, of getting in with all the media stuff and [MN] I don't know, y- you -- you can't please all the people all the time, you know?
R:  Mm mm.
L:  There's always some- someone that's not gonna, you know, [LAUGH] like what you write and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then -- then you've got all the, probably some follow up, you know, and [MN] -- and it, uh --
R:  Yeah, I guess that's why they have a section in the paper for the editorial -- I [inaudible] mind the editorial comm- -- readers' comments --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I think is what they call it.
L:  Oh.
