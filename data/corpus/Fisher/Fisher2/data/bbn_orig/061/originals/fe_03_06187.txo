L:  Hi, I'm Cindy.
R:  Hi, Helena.
L:  Current events. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, this is, uh, weird.  Um, how we w- -- how we get our current events is what they're asking?
L:  Yeah.  I used to --
R:  Well, I --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Go ahead, no, that's fine. [LAUGH]
L:  I usually listen to like, you know, the news at, you know, like, six o'clock, the news at eleven o'clock.  But when that stuff started happening in Iraq I found myself actually turning to CNN, to get the real news.
R:  Right.
L:  But now that that thing is over with I basically get it like, six o'clock and eleven o'clock.
R:  Right.  Yeah, I --
L:  And -- go ahead.
R:  I p- -- I personally never even get to catch the news so I just pretty much read the paper or Newsweek or try to find stuff on the Internet at work.
L:  Do you get a paper delivered regularly or do you just kinda buy it once in a while?
R:  We get 'em delivered to work.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  That's cool, that's cool.
R:  Yes, we have a bunch of different kinds of papers there, so -- and, um, at the place where I work they have to do current event assignments, um, and so we always have them.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's kinda cool.  See, I hate newspapers because number one, delivering at home is totally ridiculous because I never finish them, and number two is like, I hate getting the newsprint on my hands! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is annoying. [LAUGH]
L:  It's like you can't touch anything afterwards! [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  It's gross!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And if you forget that you're reading a newspaper you kinda like, scratch your face or something, you got all this black stuff all over your face.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I hate that. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  I hate that.  But it was kinda weird because when that, you know, Iraqi thing did happen, I found that even though like, for instance, Channel Four was having constant coverage, it was kinda like old, you know?  And it's like, I wanted to know what was going on right now and that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- why I wound up, you know, ch- -- uh, changing to CNN, 'cause they seemed to have like, the most current stuff.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know?  And, uh, in fact I noticed like, I -- then I'd watch the regular news 'cause I need my dosage of that, and what the regular news was talking about, CNN had told me like, the day before.  And it's like --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- it was bizarre.
R:  I didn't even know that.
L:  Yeah.  You know, 'cause you think Channel Four would be real cool and they'd be up to date but they're telling old news.
R:  Yeah, that's weird.  But -- well, I wonder how they get it that much faster?
L:  I have no idea, unless it was because CNN had so many guys that were actually there and they were doing like, w- uh, video phone or whatever they call that thing.
R:  Right, like immediate, yeah.
L:  Like instant gratification.  While --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Channel Four, I guess they taped it and then they sent it and only a few times like, in small dosages, they'd have the guys live but they wouldn't be getting into it enough.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they'd be doing like a -- a summary or something.  So --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- it was really totally bizarre.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] And then of course when I get up in the morning I'm addicted to like, the news at seven o'clock in the morning and then if -- depending upon how late I have to go into work, I might watch like, The Today Show and they kinda have like, groovy stuff.
R:  Great coverage, yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause they'll, you know, if somebody shot somebody they'll have coverage with that person's mother, or something, or their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- lawyer or something, so I enjoy doing that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't -- I'm not real up to date on current events.  I work a lot and I just -- I get depressed by it so I try not to get too caught up into it.
L:  Yeah, well they never give us anything good.
R:  I know.
L:  They don't -- the only news that they give us is the bad stuff.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So it's like, it is depressing.  But like, with Iraq I was so petrified that they were coming here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like, I felt like, "Oh my God, I'd better find out what's going on". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I felt like everyone was talking about it wherever I went, so I didn't even have to watch it, wherever I went it was like, the topic of discussion, so --
L:  Oh, I know, I know.  It was like, bizarre.
R:  All that we talked about.
L:  It was really bizarre.
R:  Oh, yeah, I actually have a friend that's still there.  She, um, went into the Army after college and she's still over there --
L:  Oh, you're kidding!
R:  -- so it's kind of scary.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I still get letters from her and she -- they keep moving her around.  I guess she's just like pumping oil to, um, like, whoever needs it.  Like, they were sending it --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- from Kuwait before, so it still makes me think that there's gotta be something going on.  She's not -- never tells me anything but I don't know if they're just stabilizing --
L:  She probably can't tell ya anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  I'm sure they're just trying to make sure things are under control but it's still -- I mean, if they need troops over there then there's still enough going on that you have to worry about it.
L:  Yeah, well, the way the news is saying it, it seems as though the troops that are over there now are mainly kinda being peace keepers.
R:  Right.
L:  Which I think is totally depressing f- like for you, for s- y- -- for knowing somebody over there.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause even though they're being peace keepers, you know, who's to say there's not a crazy Iraqi that's gonna try to shoot them?
R:  And something will break out, exactly.
L:  Yeah.  So that's like, so unsafe.  I feel so bad for you, knowing somebody over there.
R:  Yeah, than- -- yeah, she's -- she's strong.  She was actually in South Korea before, so she's been a lotta places.  There was the war going on between North Korea and South Korea --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- that -- yeah, so she was dealing with that.  So she's been -- this is her second time overseas and she's doing all right with it, so ...
L:  She already had gone to college?
R:  No, she got college in the military.  She's twenty two now.
L:  Oh, that's why she went into the military then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get the college education.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That makes sense, that makes sense.
R:  Yeah.  So and then she only has -- she's actually was supposed to get out in two months but when all this happened they kinda extended her --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- her time.  So, she was even supposed to take a leave but they just deployed everybody over so --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  -- she didn't have a choice.  And they're in tents for six months too.  She's gotta live in a tent.  So --
L:  Oh my God!
R:  I know, I could never do it.
L:  That's gotta be horrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whoa!
R:  She's tough.
L:  I just can't imagine it.  You know, for guys --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- it's okay, but for women, yuk!  [LAUGH]  You know!
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't like it at all.
L:  Oh my God, I'd rather not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- get the education than go that route.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When there's something heavy like that happening.
R:  I agree.  But she was already in -- br- at the time she joined she --
L:  Everything was cool.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  There was like, no thought of war or anything, so --
L:  Oh my God.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It just kinda happened.
L:  That is terrible.
R:  Yeah.  And then you can't -- you're -- you're pretty much stuck once you get in there, it's hard to get out!
L:  How long does -- a total is she supposed to stay?  How many years?
R:  Um, sh- --
L:  If there wasn't a breakout of something.
R:  She was t- -- the first commitment was two but then with the education that she wanted she had to sign up for another two years, so she did a total of four.
L:  Whoa!
R:  Yeah, 'cause they're doing like a hu- -- like, she'll be able to be a -- she'll be a dentist when she comes out.  Like, she's doing this whole like, dental program.
L:  Right, right.
R:  So it's ki- -- it's -- I mean, it's good, she didn't have a lotta options, she was having a hard time getting into colleges and keeping a good job, so I mean, it was good for her in her situation, she didn't feel like she had any other --
L:  Options.
R:  -- you know, didn't have her family helping or anything, so she didn't really have any other option, so --
L:  Wow.  That's a long stint though.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And she never complains.  Yeah, it really is.
L:  Four years, wow.
R:  It really is.
L:  That is a lotta time to be having to do something.
R:  Yeah.  She's been everywhere.
L:  You know, unless it's a job where you're getting security built up or something like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But to go into something like the Service and have to be stuck there for four years.  Phew!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a lotta work.
R:  I wouldn't be able to do it.  She never complains, she doesn't even complain about the tents.  All that she complained about was that they didn't have any food, so we sent her a bunch of snacks.  She's like, "Send us some good American food". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh you're kidding!
R:  Yeah, she's like, s- "Anything, cookies, chips", she's like, "There's nothing to eat over here" so --
L:  No junk food.
R:  Yeah.  So that was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the only thing she wanted [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my God! [LAUGH]
R:  So it was funny.
L:  That's incredible.  Wow.  I think it would've been harder for me to even watch that war if I actually knew somebody that was over there.
R:  Yeah.  That's why -- I mean, it was just depressing.  It was scary a lot of times.  It's easier just not to think about it.  Having to deal with it every day, it was just hard for me, so --
L:  Really.  My God.
R:  -- I didn't get caught up with it.
L:  What kind of a company that you work for where they have to do current events?
R:  I actually work for, um, a drug and alcohol rehab for mothers and children.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So they have groups all day and things and, um, so they -- to keep them up -- they're in groups from nine to five basically, just dealing with addiction and things around their lives.  And so every night, so they don't get behind we have them do like, a current event.  They either have to read the paper or watch TV and try to keep up with things, so they're not falling behind in society, 'cause they live in the program for six months.
L:  I see, I see.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Oh, well that's cool.
R:  Yeah, it's fun.
L:  You know, and also I think if they kinda know what's going on in the world it can help them get out of the problems that they're having.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  That's really cool.
R:  Yeah.  It's a great program.
L:  What part of the country do you live in?
R:  I live in LA.
L:  Oh, you're in LA?  I'm in Thousand Oaks.
R:  Oh okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're both out here.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Are you from California or from somewhere else?
R:  I was actually born in New Jersey and raised in Pennsylvania.
L:  I was born in New York, raised in --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- New York.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I came out here in seventy six -- but I'm like fifty three years old -- I'm old. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] No you're not! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well I'm beginning to feel old because I went to my doctor.  It's kinda like I have to worry about things now, you know, like, "Check your heart, check this, check that".
R:  Right.
L:  And so even though I'm not really old I'm kinda feeling old, I'm beginning to feel like my father! [LAUGH] You know!
R:  [LAUGH] Oh!
L:  With doctors and medication and ugh!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ...
R:  Do you -- do you like it out here better?
L:  Oh God.   I think that in another lifetime I was
