R:  Hello, my name is Laine.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, [MN] I'm Jennifer.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Hi, Jennifer.  [SIGH]  I get my -- most of my information from the television especially but [SIGH] then some of it comes from the newspaper.  What about you?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I do mostly, um, the ten o'clock news.  [LAUGH]  And the --
R:  Late night?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I catch, like, the first fifteen minutes [NOISE] and then it's bedtime ... pretty much.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  And I do headline news usually at six thirty AM.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, do you really?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And then --
L:  I never --
R:  -- two or three times throughout the day, you know, I really try to keep up with what's going on in the world.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  That's good.  I --
R:  Just so I can be informed.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I should but I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I get in my own little world.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well sometimes it's better not to watch it.  It's very depressing at times.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Some other thing they just seem to -- seem to s- sensationalize the bad stuff.  So, ...
R:  Uh-hum.  So, where are you at?  [SIGH]
L:  I'm in Richmond, Virginia.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, I'm in Oklahoma.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  Out in the boonies.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know sometimes I feel like this is the boonies too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Just depending.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  But I was relieved to hear the -- the topic is actually, how you get your news, rather than what is in the news, because sometimes -- [SIGH] and this has been one of those weeks where I just really haven't kept up with things.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, like I said sometimes you feel it's better just to turn the TV off and avoid all the bad news 'cause they seem to just [SIGH] d- dwell on the bad news more than the good news.
L:  Yeah, [MN] and I guess that is kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more ... t- the news, you know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Supposedly what people need to know but [SIGH] sometimes I wonder.
R:  But there -- sometimes there's too much of it on there that we don't really need to know about.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  We need to focus more on, you know, the girl scout troop and [NOISE] ... granted it's not ... e- exiting but, you know, it's something ... you know, --
R:  It's good news, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you know, community service kind of stuff.
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  And what kind of good stuff kids are doing at school, rather than the bad stuff.  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, y- yeah, exactly.
R:  School shootings or whatever.
L:  [MN]  I think that's half of teenagers' problems these days.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, they see it on TV and then they dwell on it.  It's like, "Hm".  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  And like it was -- they did with Columbine [NOISE] I mean they just [SIGH] ...
R:  Just wouldn't let it alone would they?
L:  Exactly, and there's been so many more since then.
R:  Do you have children in school?
L:  [SIGH]  I do. I have, um, a elementary school ...a third grader.
R:  [SIGH]  I have a son at home that's fifteen.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  He's in high school.  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]  So, yeah, we -- even --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- here in the little ... town that we're at, there's p- plenty going on at school.  And it's like recently they just [SIGH] -- they -- there was an incident at school --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and they dwelled on it in the newspaper, letters to the editor.  They just kept going on and on and on about it.  It's like, "Quit all the hype".  [SIGH]
L:  And they wouldn't leave it alone?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  Yeah.  And we had the -- the same thing where a kid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had a bebe gun in the parking lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of a high school [SIGH] and, um, it was just all over the papers.  [SIGH]  And, y- yeah, granted he shouldn't have ... had it there but ... it looks --
R:  No.  [NOISE]
L:  -- like it gave other kid -- kids ideas, you know.
R:  Yeah, and think about his poor family what they're feeling.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Leave him alone.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.  I mean, I d- don't think they have the kid's name just because he was under eighteen.
R:  'Cause he's a minor.
L:  Yeah, but I mean, you know, every kid in -- in that particular school knew who it was.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, if you're in a small place like we're at, everybody knows everybody's business.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whether you want 'em to or not.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  We have several neighbors -- neighbors like that.  [LAUGH]  I think every neighborhood has one.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [LAUGH]  We're out in the country now so I don't have to worry about that.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We put up with it for years living in base housing in the military.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I loved living in base housing but I didn't like the fact that everybody knew what everybody was doing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Yeah, I'm in a -- a town house right now so it's ... close quarters [LAUGH] ... with everybody else.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But ... do you use the Internet much?
R:  Oh, yes, [SIGH] a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's where I find out about this study, ah, on the Internet.
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Oh!
L:  That -- that's how I found out ... also.
R:  From a group of friends.  [SIGH]
L:  I'm in a, um, ... a couponing --
R:  Ah, oh!
L:  -- club kind of thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too!  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, no.  Is it Beth's?
R:  Is it what?
L:  Um, [SIGH] Beth's?
R:  No.
L:  Ah, Beth, ah -- I don't know her name.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm involved with Refunding Makes Cents.  Are you on that?
L:  No, I haven't heard of that one.
R:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK]  Well, it's a magazine I subscribe to and then they have a web site where you can access all the information in it.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, yeah, that's where I found out about this.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  S- small world.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it is.  It really is.  [SIGH]  Funny the way that it w- works.  [SIGH]
R:  Some of the topics have been interesting.  Some I've [SIGH] hung up on.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]  Huh?  I haven't hung up on any yet.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Something about politics.  [SIGH]  I didn't want to talk about politics.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I don't blame you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't think I could handle that one either.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I'm not too big on them these days.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me or you, either one.
L:  Pardon?
R:  Me or you, either one.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]
R:  Well, what else shall we talk about that involves current events?  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know what they told you this call was current events.
L:  Yeah, I'm trying to think what other ways.  Well, I guess ... [SIGH] I get a lot of my news from talking to people at work also.  You know, "Have you heard this?" or ... whatever is going on.
R:  Mm.
L:  Anything to avoid work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, everybody knows what's going on in the world.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Like to stay informed.  [SIGH]  But then sometimes we're too informed.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I like having it available though, you know, because I mean there's so many countries wh- where, like, you know, Iraq ... they kind of heard what the government wanted them to hear.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Not that we don't hear what the government wants us to hear, I just feel like it's more [SIGH] ... open, I guess.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, that it's our own media rather than ... government media.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  So, what kind of coupon club did you say you're in?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Somebody's coupon club, particularly?  [SIGH]
L:  Um, Beth Young ... [SIGH] started one, um, a couple of months ago I guess it was.  [SIGH]
R:  Hm.  Is she on the Internet?
L:  Y- yeah, [SIGH] yeah, she's on, um, Yahoo.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  [PAUSE]  I'll have to check it out.  See if I can find it.
L:  Yeah, um, Elizabeth Young is her name, um ...
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, gosh, [LAUGH] I'm trying to remember.
R:  Do you have a web site?
L:  No, it's -- it's through, um, like one of the [MN] Yahoo groups.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, ... [PAUSE]
R:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I can check that out.
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's --
R:  I can probably find her there.
L:  -- it's Beth, um [SIGH] oh, gosh, I'm [MN] -- I can't remember the name of it.  I'm sorry.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, you should look up Refunding Makes Cents.  Just go to Google and look it up and you should be able to bring it up like that.  [SIGH]
L:  Refunding Makes Sense --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- okay.  There must be our thing to do.
R:  C.E.N.T.S.  Cents.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, thank you, I would have spelt it wrong.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, it's a magazine.  A woman's been publishing it for years.  I've been s- subscribing to it for nine years but it's -- like since it's been on the Internet -- oh, I'll look --you don't even need the magazine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- since you can f- find all the information on the web site.
L:  I think my mom had subscribed to that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a long time ago.  It's like a -- a t- typed thing that was, like,  real, real small print and like a m- million of 'em?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  She used to d- do those.  I have seen that.  It's, um, Beth's Coupon Mailing, it's the name of the group.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And she's on Yahoo, huh?  Yahoo ... groups.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  And what is your name?  I'll send her an -- an email letting her know you're --
R:  My name is Laine, L.A.I.N.E.  [SIGH]
L:  Laine, okay.
R:  Jackson.  [PAUSE]  I might be interested.  Y'all just trade coupons amongst each other and ...?
L:  Yeah, and just post 'em [NOISE] and, um, download and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- save money.  [LAUGH]
R:  I hear that.  I'm into that.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Coupons, rebates, refunds.  [SIGH]  Free stuff.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You can find that at the Refunding Makes Cents.  [SIGH]
L:  I'll have to check that one out too.  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]
R:  Lots of freebies.  [SIGH]  What --
L:  It's amazing 'cause --
R:  -- what's -- what did you tell me your name was?
L:  [SIGH]  I'm Jennifer ... Jordan.
R:  Jordan.  And you're in ... Richmond, Virginia.  Wow!  Well, this has been interesting.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it -- it's so funny because there's so many people -- you ... [SIGH] almost feel embarrassed to go into the dollar store but then [LAUGH] -- on line it's like save every -- [SIGH] everything you can it seems.  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]  [MN]
R:  Well, [PAUSE] -- so is this your first time to do this Fisher thing?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, actually, this is my third call.  [SIGH]
R:  Good for you, [NOISE] you'll get paid now, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  I haven't seen a check yet, we'll see.  [LAUGH]
R:  This is my second one.  They say you get paid after your third one.
L:  After the third one?
R:  After you finish up with your third call.
L:  Oh, yeh.  I'll have to wait -- [LAUGH] check the mail.
R:  Two to three weeks after that.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, that's encouraging.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, you look me up if you get on Refunding Makes Cents.  If you decide to s- subscribe to the magazine, you use my name as a referral.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Okay, I will.
R:  It's very interesting.  You can save a lot of money through just h- having the magazine and having the knowledge of what's going on in the w- -- re- refunding and c- coupon world.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And you can find loads of people to trade out stuff with.  [SIGH]
L:  It's amazing what companies pay for trash these days.
R:  It is.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, really.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well ...
L:  I did one a couple of months ago when it was ten dollars off the ... Quaker ... stuff.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  In the Tropicana, and I did one for my house and then one for my parent's house.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, I do those kind of things all the time.  [SIGH]
L:  I l- love those.  [LAUGH]
R:  And take test drives and they pay you to take a test drive in a vehicle.  That's all you've got to do is test drive it.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  I haven't seen that one.
R:  Uh-hum, all the time.  Car companies are always doing that.
L:  Hm.  [SIGH]  Cars just make me nervous [SIGH] when I don't own them.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  But -- but sometimes you don't even have to take a test drive.  You just tell 'em you're not interested and they'll sign your paper anyway and ... you --
L:  And --
R:  -- can get paid.
L:  -- t- then you don't have to worry about wasting their time and --
R:  Uh-hum, or yours 'cause you know you're not going to buy the vehicle.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  No way.
L:  Don't have to chance taking it on the road that way.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  Well, I hope they don't get upset with us for getting off topic.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ... we kind of [SIGH] --
R:  That's my current event for the day.
L:  [SIGH]  You --
R:  Trying to keep up with what's going on in the coupon world.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I think it's --
