R:  Hi, this is Lillian.
L:  Hi, my name's Linda.  It was Lorrianne? 
R:  Lillian.
L:  Lorian?
R:  No, Lillian.
L:  Lillian.  Oh, s- -- I beg your pardon. [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I guess I need linguistics. [LAUGH] [LIPSMACK] Okay, current affairs and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how do we keep up with 'em.  Do you -- do you think that's what they want from us?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Well, you can go first.  Why don't ya?
R:  O- Okay, well I use a couple of different ways but, uh, I guess [NOISE] primarily it's the TV.  Um, I try to catch like the ten o'clock news at night 'cause I like to be in bed by eleven.
L:  Mm.
R:  But during the day, um, I'm on the internet a lot so I get my top news stories, I guess, from the internet. [NOISE]
L:  All right. [LIPSMACK] And, let's see, um, I listen to national public radio in the morning and in the afternoon --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that's pretty much my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sole input as far as [NOISE] current events.  Um, every once in a while I come across the paper at work.  Somebody brought one in and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- abandoned it so I get caught up on some local news --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- by, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a local paper.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  What city are you in?
R:  I'm in Ringwood, New Jersey.
L:  And I'm in Tampa, Florida.
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  Well, yes, we're coming into the very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hot, humid part of the year but it's, um, it's a small price to pay for the wonderful winter weather.
R:  So, do we have to talk for ten minutes about our subject?
L:  Well, they suggest that so that we can get started but I'm not sure that they're particularly concerned about the topic but they just need ten minutes of conversation to, um, to collect data, I think.
R:  Okay, well I will -- I wanna move to Florida.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'd like to move to southern Florida.
L:  There's room for about two more people down here and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I know.  Everyone's going.
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's, um -- we have a lot of issues with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting fresh water to the right people, or to the people.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Um, the Everglades have been nearly destroyed and [SIGH], um, there was a government plan that the United States planned to restore and try to rebuild --
R:  The Everglades.
L:  -- the Everglades and [NOISE] the main organisation that's against that are the sugar cane, um, producers.  The --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sugar interests because they wanna continue to pollute the Everglades and kill it with the run off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the second [SIGH] biggest offender; believe it or not Florida has a lot of cattle industry.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.  That was one of the biggest industries when Florida was first, [NOISE] um, populated.  A lot of Florida cowboys.
R:  Wow.  I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.  And so there's still some cattle and, um, the phosphate is a huge industry in Florida.  We have some of the biggest deposits of phosphate, I think, in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And right now we have a phosphate crater within a hundred miles of -- of Tampa and it's filled with water and now it's -- it's starting to [NOISE] run off and once that phosphate starts to run out of the crater it'll start polluting the land around it and get down into the well water.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, Florida's pretty much limestone. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  And it's very porous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and once that contamination starts [NOISE] then [SIGH] it -- it's not a good thing.  So --
R:  No, it's not.
L:  -- they came up with a plan.  The government came up with a plan that they were gonna create two miles of pipeline from that [NOISE] phosphate crater [NOISE] to the gulf or to the bay.  I'm sorry --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know which; probably to the bay and pump it into barges and take it forty miles out into the gulf and pollute the gulf. [SIGH] Um, we got a lot of problems down here with water.  
R:  [MN]
L:  So, if you're thinking about going somewhere where it's warm [LAUGH] just be sure that --
R:  That you can have water. [LAUGH]
L:  That you can have water.  Um, it's just, um, a big problem.
R:  Wow.
L:  Do you have small children you want to be educated?
R:  Yes.
L:  You gonna put 'em in private school when you get down here?
R:  Um, haven't thought about it because I have a nineteen month old daughter.
L:  Well, I tell you what, [SIGH] these are not necessarily good public schools down here so do a lot of investigation about the neighborhood that you might wanna get into.  If you do come down I would rent at least for a year. 
R:  Right, before you decide to stay.
L:  Before you decide to stay and where you wanna stay.  So many people buy right away and then find out that the schools that are designated for their neighborhood --
R:  Area, mhm.
L:  -- are not the schools that you might necessarily pick.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, be very careful about that.
R:  Oh, thank you for that advice.
L:  Yeah.  Florida's -- is great in many ways. [MN] It has just been -- it's been prostituted if you'll pardon the use of the word.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it's, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] it's a gorgeous place.  It was more gorgeous before we got in here.  Um, we had some beautiful woods not two and a half miles from where I live; not huge, but they were putting out enough carbon dioxide, or I'm sorry, oxygen [NOISE] --
R:  Right, so you c- --
L:  -- to help with the air quality.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I've seen sever- several acres of land close to where I live destroyed so that something else can be built.
R:  Wow.
L:  [SIGH] And, uh, I don't think it's any different anywhere else.  Or maybe it is.  They're -- they're just -- we're growing much faster than we can provide services.  There -- there's too many people for the number of police that we have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's too many people for the fire department and we're -- and Florida's just like any place else now; we got no money.  No states have money.
R:  Right.
L:  And there's no way to -- to keep up the infrastructure.
R:  Yeah, well that's the other thing too; getting jobs down there.
L:  I've been out of work a year and a half.
R:  You're kidding?
L:  I have a masters degree and I lost my job in August of two thousand one and I was at that age where I could elect to retire.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, [MN] I took some time off then my entire pension was lost in --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- the stock boom so I need to go back to work and I have been looking --
R:  What industry are you in -- or were you in?
L:  Well, I taught school for twelve years. [NOISE] That was twenty some years ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then I got into computers and data processing and I wrote code for the phone company --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for their systems.  [SIGH] Uh, and [SIGH] I've got my masters degree so I can demonstrate to people that I can be trained. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, you're absolutely trainable.
L:  And I have -- I must've applied for [NOISE], I don't know, twenty five or thirty jobs in the last -- since November and there are so many applicants that I'm lucky that they'll take me for an interview.
R:  Wow.
L:  Because they have so many applicants.  So, what field are you in?  Or your husband or whatever?
R:  Um, well I u- -- I was in the garment industry for thirteen years and, uh, the garment industry in New York [LAUGH] went -- has gone way south. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Out of the country, right?
R:  Yeah, out of the country.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] and I was a specialist.  I d- -- I did stuff with computers too.  I was a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cad specialist.  I did all computer aided design and manufacturing.
L:  Ooh, that's super.
R:  So, I was like in a niche and, um, my niche is gone.  I mean, I was making six figures for --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- more than half my career.  I was doing very well.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  And, um, you know, it just -- it bottomed out. [LIPSMACK] And then I went through some personal prob- -- personal changes.  I had lost my job because my company went Chapter eleven.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, which is very typical.  I worked for a couple of them that went Chapter eleven.
L:  Oh, golly.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] now I'm staying home to take care of my daughter.
L:  Well, she needs that and that's good for both of you but somebody's [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, it is.  But I -- you know, I'd like the income.  My husband, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has his own construction company but, you know, he just started that up, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- last year so it's been about a year and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- business is good.  He does a lot of public works but, you know, he's not home a lot --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because of where we live and where the work is.
L:  Ah, so he has to commute a lot?
R:  Well, yeah, we live in northern New Jersey on the border of New York State and he goes into New Yor- -- into Queens actually, New York which is, you know, an hour commute without traffic.  So --
L:  Oh, my golly.
R:  Two hours with traffic.  So, he's not around a lot.
L:  And the price of gasoline.  That's gotta be expensive.
R:  Uh, yeah, and he drives a big old diesel [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, golly.
R:  -- for work.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, it's a lot but, um, you know, when you hear other people's problems you realize you're not in that bad a shape sometimes.
L:  Yeah, it's interesting to look around and compare stories and both of you end up feeling not quite so bad because everybody's got problems.  It's just -- there's very few people that can say truthfully   But you've got your health I would -- I hope.  I mean --
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  And your husband too 'cause --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- he's out there working and -- and your daughter's healthy so thank god for that. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, you have to look at it that way sometimes.  But, you know, sometimes you get pigeon holed in your own stuff and you get wrapped up in your --
L:  Yes, and you get kinda self   Well --
R:  Self -- yeah, self absorbed. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's a good word for it.  Right.  Well, luckily enough I was enough years with, uh, the phone company to have a health plan and that
