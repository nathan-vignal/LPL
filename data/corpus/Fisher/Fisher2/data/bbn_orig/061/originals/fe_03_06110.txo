R:  Hi, this --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- is Sherrie.
L:  Hi, I'm Carla.
R:  How are you, Carla?
L:  I'm fine.  And where are you from?
R:  I'm from Utah; Provo, Utah.
L:  U- Utah?  I'm in Arkansas.
R:  Oh, that's ve- [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] That's a long way.
R:  It sure is. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [SIGH]
R:  Pretty fun study. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, have you done, um, these calls before?
R:  Yeah, I've done two.  This is my --
L:  Oh, have --
R:  -- third.
L:  Oh, is it?  This is the first time I've done it, so --
R:  Okay.
L:  I wasn't sure how it's supposed to go.
R:  Just basically answer the question.  Talk about current events and how -- how you get your information for what's going on in the world and stuff.
L:  Okay.  Well, how do -- where do we start? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I guess I could start. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Yeah, you start. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Actually, um, I don't really watch a lot of news 'cause I don't have Cable and my reception's really bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, mostly I hear about what's going on from my friends.  Like my friend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- watches the news all the time and for a while he was watching it until two or three in the morning during the war, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now he's just like, "Oh, all that it's getting boring.  I don't even wanna watch it any more". 
L:  Well, it seems like it's the same stuff over and over.  I mean --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I don't know.  Of course --
R:  Yeah, that -- exactly.  That's what he says too.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I read the newspaper every day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I watch some of the news but then my husband tells me a lot of things too.  But -- and when y- -- when I get on line on AOL --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can look at the things -- I mean, well, yeah, you read about it there.  But it seems like it's the same things.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I looked at all the newspapers and the headings were all the same.  Something about Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And just like, "Okay". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I thought we were pretty well through over there, but [SIGH] I --
R:  Yeah, they're just dragging it out.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what else we're supposed to do.  Um, I don't know.  All the looting and everything going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if it's still going on now as much --
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  -- as it was.  
R:  Yeah, I don't know if he's made it better over there or -- or not. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think we started out to make it better --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then [SIGH] I don't know h- -- what happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you -- you think that if they're so religious over there, um, all the stealing and killing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that looting to me is stealing.
R:  Oh, yeah, totally. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] and, you know, if they're so religious I didn't think they did stuff -- well, y- --
R:  That's pretty much all they're talking about is looting and every day it's the same stuff, huh?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] sometimes on AOL it'll have different little stories or in the paper but the paper doesn't really have all that much in it any more.
R:  Um, no it doesn't.
L:  Do you and your friends talk about it much any more?
R:  No, not too much.  I'm like   Every night for a while every night he -- he'd call me and we'd -- he'd be like, "So, what's going on in the war?"  I'm like, "Oh, uh, this and this and that.  You tell me.  You're the one that watches it".  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  
R:  He just wanted to see if I was up on it and he was so excited about it.  Every night that's all I'd hear.  "What's going on in the war?" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I -- do you -- do you have anybody that's over there?
R:  No, I don't but my friend does.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mm, her husband.  He's still over there and she's really missing him bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I bet.
R:  It's bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I was scared.  I've got grand kids and, um, of course the oldest one's only -- well, he's almost seven and I was afraid this might be another Vietnam and --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  I thought, "Oh, geez.  You know, I hate when he gets old enough to be drafted". 
R:  Oh, yeah, that would be bad.
L:  Yeah.  Well, surely they won't have to drag it out until then but --
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  Hopefully not.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That'd be ridiculous.  Then we'd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really be poor.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Our economy's already pretty bad. [LAUGH]
L:  I was gonna say I'm poor enough already. [LAUGH] I don't need to be any --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more poor.
R:  I don't know why Bush is so popular.  I think the media makes him out to be more popular than he is and -- and there's the suckers that believe it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I ho- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wish the media wouldn't do that 'cause I don't want him -- I -- I would like to see our economy get better and --
L:  Oh, yeah, I can't say --
R:  I just don't want to see him in office again. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I can't say too much about a President.  I mean, you know, Clinton was from Arkansas so, [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah, but I mean --
L:  But I didn't vote for him. [LAUGH]
R:  At least we had a good economy. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] If he could keep his pants zipped up he'd be --
R:  Y- --
L:  -- okay. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [SIGH] How embarassing.
R:  And I get a lot of news like if I do watch about current events it's from Oprah or something. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's more interesting to me [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- than the news. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, um, on Prime Time Live on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- TV, things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, you know, like those kind of shows and they tell some of the news, you know, things that are going on sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but not all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  Look at how the Dixie Chicks got in trouble. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, about saying they were ashamed to be from Texas.
R:  I didn't think there was anything wrong with the --
L:  I didn't either.
R:  -- what they said but I think maybe   I think why everybody was upset is because they were -- they went out of their way to broadcast the Grammys to the soldiers.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And so that could've been really down heartening for the soldiers.  Like everyone was trying to support the soldiers, whether they agree with Bush or not, everyone was trying to rally around the soldiers, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that was kinda why everyone got mad.
L:  Well, I -- you know, I didn't believe in about the war either but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I supported what they, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- were doing.
R:  'Cause we like learned from Vietnam 'cause how everyone was like rude to the poor ki-, uh, army people and they were just doing what they had to do, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people learned from that and learned to support their soldiers.  Y- you know, they're just doing what the government told them and --
L:  Yeah.  Did you get that off Oprah too?
R:  Um, I'm not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sure where I got it.  I think I just formulated that from --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- different opinions around me and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, you hear so many people talking about it.  I mean, you can be in a restaurant and you can overhear people talking -- well, at that time.  Not so much now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everybody was talking about the war.  So --
R:  Yeah, now it's not, you know, it's just like, "When are they gonna bring home our soldiers?"  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, is there an airbase or a -- a base up where you live?
R:  Yeah, there's the Hill Air Force Base.
L:  Is there?  Okay, well there --
R:  What --
L:  Um, there's the Little Rock Air Force Base here and they just brought a lot of 'em home.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  I read it in the paper. [LAUGH]
R:  All right. [LAUGH]
L:  I think it was the first of this month that --
R:  Well, that's a -- that's a good thing to read in the paper. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it had pictures of families, you know, showing and everything.  It's really sad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There -- there's so many of 'em that haven't even seen their kids that have been born.
R:  Oh, man, that is sad.
L:  It's -- you know, they're about six months old or whatever and --
R:  Oh. [SIGH]
L:  -- they haven't even seen 'em.
R:  Oh, man. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's horrible.
R:  That is so hard, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know why these people -- I think -- one of my friends put it well.  They should just let the -- the leaders of the countries, you know, get in the boxing ring and duke it out.
L:  Ooh, yeah.
R:  Instead of dragging in all their citizens.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And then whichever of 'em wins that -- then they get to do things their way, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As long as they're not trying to take over one or another's country but if they're like -- you know what I mean.
L:  Yeah.  That would be some good pictures in the paper. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] A little mud wrestle or something. [LAUGH] 
L:  Or an Oprah -- a good --
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  -- O- Oprah show.  That would be --
R:  Oh, yeah, just put 'em in the ring together. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Put Saddam and Bush in the ring together.  Let them duke it out. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ooh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Uh, [LAUGH] I almost thought we got off but we didn't.
L:  Oh.
R:  Phew! [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, um, [SIGH] has it been ten minutes yet?
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Probably close to. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know of any place else, you know, that we get our current -- I mean, how -- how long can we talk on this?
R:  Well, what --
L:  Once the --
R:  -- they do is like -- oh, I know. [LAUGH] They usually just, um, it'll beep and they'll say, "Okay, you have thirty seconds to say goodbye, or whatever".  
L:  [MN] Oh, okay.
R:  So, it should be -- shouldn't be too much longer.
L:  I mean --
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, how much longer can you talk about current even- -- where you get information for current events?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, without going into the current events.
L:  Yeah, yeah, you'd have to talk about 'em because -- I mean, the paper, TV, friends, or what was the other one?
R:  Uh, Oprah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oprah. [LAUGH] Well, that would be TV but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, was there another, um --
R:  There was the paper, the television, the friend, was it internet?
L:  Internet.  I guess, yeah.  I mean, after you say where you get --
R:  I don't have internet service.  My modem's down.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I've been trying to get it and trying to get it and trying to get it because, yeah, sometimes I li- -- I see it.  If you -- on Yahoo it'll say what's going on -- the front page.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, we just get on.  We have AOL so I don't ever get on any of those other things but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they -- you can read the whole paper and everything right there.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they have a lot of stuff on there.
R:  Well, that's a good idea.  Soon as I get my modem fixed.
L:  And then they have, um, the TV.  You can read about TV shows and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I hate to --
R:  Sometimes --
L:  -- get on there.  I waste -- I waste so much time getting on the -- on the computer. [LAUGH]
R:  But it's fun, isn't it? [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, um, when my grandkids are over here they're fighting over who's gonna get on it and --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  I say, "It's my turn". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It's grandma's computer. [LAUGH] Um, how old are your grand kids?
L:  Well, one's almost seven [SIGH] and one is four and then twenty one months --
R:  Mm.
L:  A little girl.  Two boys and a girl.
R:  Yeah, see another -- like another thing that is -- the web's -- the internet's a little bit more honest. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You can get more broad views --
L:  Yeah, um, some --
R:  -- than just on TV.
L:  -- people say you can't believe everything you read on -- on there though.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you can't believe any-
