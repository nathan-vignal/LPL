R:  Hi!
L:  -- are you?
R:  I'm doing well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Good.  Good.  [NOISE]
R:  Have you -- have you done this before?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, twice, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Twice before.  [NOISE]
R:  Me too.
L:  Have you?  [NOISE]  Twice before?
R:  Yes, twice.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it's pretty -- [SIGH] it's pretty cool you get to [SIGH] chit chat and [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and get a check for it and [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can live with that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, ...
R:  [SIGH]  Well, um, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- where are you at?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What -- what part of the country?
L:  [NOISE]  I'm in Connecticut.  How about you?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  I'm in Utah.  [SIGH]
L:  Utah.  Oh, wow!  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're well ways away from each other.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  A little bit, so probably don't read the same newspaper.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  No.  So, how do you get your current event ... news and ... [SIGH]
R:  Well, you know, I watch --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- some news but usually it's just so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- darned depressing that --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I just, you know, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, online --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm online quite a bit 'cause my business is on line and --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] so [SIGH] I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of check [SIGH] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- status of things on there and, um, you know, kind of a combination --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of everything that they said.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Every once in a while --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I hear things on the radio, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- at my local newspaper.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  You know, I -- I just be -- other people [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] some days [NOISE] we're so busy --
R:  Cover.
L:  -- [NOISE] my husband will come home from work and say, [NOISE] "Did you hear about this?"  I'm like, "How do you know about it [NOISE] when I [NOISE] you know, [LAUGH] --"
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  "-- [NOISE] haven't heard about it?"
R:  Exactly.
L:  But ...  [NOISE]
R:  Are you a -- are you a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at home mom?
L:  At home mom, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  You can hear my --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- [NOISE] demanding son, over there.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Um, [LAUGH] [NOISE] yeah, I -- um, probably a combination too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  A lot of online, [NOISE] you know.  I check on line --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] a lot.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] ah, the Today Show.  I mean that's my big one.  [SIGH]  That's my [NOISE] -- my little [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] self indulgence in the morning --
R:  Oh, so you're up --
L:  -- [NOISE] you know, my little ritual.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, you're up at that hour and a- able to have time for yourself, huh?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, -- well, no, he's up there t- -- you -- you know, the whole family's --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- kind of up.  [NOISE]  But --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I just kind of let him wander around and play while I [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- veg in front of the TV for a little bit and then --
R:  [LAUGH]  [COUGH]
L:  -- that's [SIGH] the only time I really allow myself to do that.  [NOISE]  So, ...
R:  Oh, good for you.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, he's pretty good.  He gets up and plays and [NOISE], you know, [SIGH] -- well, you're in Utah, [NOISE] is it on e- earlier there?  It's on from seven to -- [NOISE] [SIGH] to about ten here.
R:  Oh, you know what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't even know.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  Um, [SIGH] usually, at that hour -- the mornings are the most hectic for me so I'm getting kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out of bed and I have two.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  I have a four year old and a one year old and I'm getting 'em --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, okay.
R:  -- you know, they wake up at different times --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm getting 'em [SIGH] fed and clothed and clean, and --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- all that that I -- I don't even know.  I think it does come on at seven o'clock.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  It's probably the same time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, you know, that's --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- I -- I guess that's not too early that --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- a lot of moms are up at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that [LAUGH] hour.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, we don't have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- much of a choice sometimes.  [LAUGH]  But ...
R:  Yeah, but I don't -- I don't -- I'm usually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- up by six thirty with my son, six thirty seven --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and my daughter doesn't wake up until about eight thirty.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  So, I get --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- him off -- handled and whatever and then she's up so --
L:  [NOISE]  So, the Today Show -- 
R:  -- [SIGH] I usually --
L:  -- isn't ... [SIGH] a big one for you?  [SIGH] [NOISE]  And --
R:  No, it's just not an opportune one --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- I should say, you know, 'cause I like it.  I've actually -- I mean I really like, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Kitty Carrick[?] and
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean I ... would like to be able to watch it, but --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, I, um, [SIGH] [MN] what -- what places do you go for -- on the news -- on the, um, Internet for news?  [SIGH]  Like do you --
R:  Oh, well MSN is --
L:  MSN --
R:  -- my --
L:  -- big one.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, well it's my, um, my ISP so I --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I end up getting, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when the first palm page comes up I get information --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on there and --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- then I just kind of link to whatever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- site sounds interesting, that I --
L:  We have, um, [NOISE] --
R:  -- want to hear about.
L:  -- the AOL one.  [NOISE]  That usually has like a front ... story too, you know, it has the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] rotating stories.  I'm sure it's very similar.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, we're thinking of changing, actually and [NOISE] [SIGH] I'll miss that so, hopefully, whatever I c- change to -- I -- I think you can designate your home page, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] sometimes.
R:  Ye- yeah, you --
L:  [NOISE]  So, --
R:  -- yeah, who are you thinking of going with or ...
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, we're going to do the cable [SIGH] modem probably.  [NOISE]  We're on [NOISE] d- dial up right now right now.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] we have an extra phone line so that we don't [NOISE] you know, do the busy signal thing, and [NOISE] [MN] tie up the phone while we're on line.  [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  And we figured out that paying for the extra phone line [SIGH] and for AOL [SIGH] would cost [NOISE] the same or [NOISE] more, than if we went with cable.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, and we'd have a cable modem instead of [SIGH] a slow dial up.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, how nice.
L:  You know, so hopefully that'll -- that'll change and then I can get my news even faster.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  You know, so do you subscribe to papers or ...?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I've got a, [SIGH] um, our local --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- paper here.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
R:  I -- I live in a rural area.  We don't even have ... the option of --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- cable, you know, high speed Internet here.
L:  No, oh!  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so, um --
L:  We just [NOISE] --
R:  -- not yet.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Um, so we've just got a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- local paper that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, about ... eight pages --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- long and most of that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is sports and [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH]  Sports are big [NOISE] -- big topic --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in rural Utah, huh?  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  I guess so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I just -- the kids and you know, I think they just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they talk so much about it because they ... want to sell up the pages partly and also that [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you know, that, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually, we do pretty good out here.  We've got, you know, some pretty good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, championships and, um, [SIGH] you know --
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!  Utah --
R:  -- the kids have done pretty well.  So, ...
L:  My sister at one ... time she's [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like twenty five now, but she was in a -- a [LIPSMACK] -- like the Junior Olympics or whatever -- [NOISE] the AAU [SIGH] type team and they went out to Utah to play.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [NOISE]  And she said it was gorgeous.  [NOISE]  And --
R:  It is.  It's --
L:  [SIGH]  So, I'm [NOISE] --
R:  -- really pretty.
L:  -- I'm sure, [SIGH] you know, that was a [SIGH] -- a big event for sports --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- enthusiasts [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- out there.  [NOISE]  But ...
R:  Now what -- now what about you -- where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where there's, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you subscribe to the paper?
L:  Um, yeah, I subscribe to the [SIGH] [NOISE] -- the weekend paper and the [NOISE] [MN] like, the Thursday paper because you get like the fliers, the circulars and stuff.  [NOISE]  I'm big on coupons and stuff like that.  So, --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, [SIGH] I -- I do the Sunday paper.  [SIGH]  Although I'm thinking of [SIGH] um, cancelling it and buying it [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] just because nine out of ten times if it's raining it's going to be soaking wet and --
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] oh, [SIGH] it's just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- frustrating.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  They don't put it in plastic for you?
L:  [NOISE]  They do but they th- throw it on the driveway and we live on a hill and the water runs down --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and runs into the bag, so I get a bag of water with the paper floating in it.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, lovely.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  It doesn't make for a very en- -- very, ah, fun --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reading time.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, especially when you subscribe you know, you -- I mean I -- I read it but [SIGH] I'm also interested in, like, the coupons and things that you have to cut out and save.  And [SIGH] it's really bad hanging it over your clothes drying rack [SIGH] to [SIGH] get things to dry out, so you can see what's there.  [SIGH]  But ...
R:  Oh, have you tried any of the sites on line that give coupons -- that do coupons?
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, I -- I love those.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  They're good.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, do --
R:  Now are you -- do you -- have -- is your l- local -- I mean do you have a radio station that you listen to that talks about news much or do you mostly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do music?
L:  I'm -- you know what, I think I'm w- weird because I really can't stand music on the radio in the car [SIGH] which -- I feel bad.  I feel like my son's being deprived of a musical ... [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- experience or something.  But I really listen to talk radio more than anything.  [SIGH]  So, I -- I do get a lot of news from there, you know, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- when I'm ... out and about driving which [SIGH] you know, is [NOISE] not t- that often, but often enough.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  How old's your son?
L:  He's ... nineteen months old.
R:  Oh, [MN] my.  Okay.
L:  And your's is a year.  You said you're -- one of your babies ...
R:  Yeah, he'll be a year in a +couple of weeks and then my daughter --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- is ... four in July.
L:  Wow!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  So, ...
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] we have a -- a set of twins coming too so ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Congratulations!
L:  Thanks.
R:  My goodness!
L:  Thank you.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  When are you due?
L:  But [SIGH] it's [SIGH] pretty early it's [SIGH] D- December but [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I mean it's absolutely early.  But [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  -- it's just [SIGH] -- oh, boy, I'm going to have to rely on [SIGH] the Internet and TV more than anything.  [NOISE]  'Cause [SIGH] I told my husband I don't how I'm going to get out of the house with three of them.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I -- no, I mean, I -- I oh, boy, I feel for you.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know how people can do that --
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- with twins.  I just think [SIGH] -- my husband and I thought we wanted twins, you know, just get it -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get the two kids over with because we knew --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we only wanted to have two.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  And, um, but I -- I look at other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mothers that I've seen have twins and think, "Oh, my gosh, how could you do it?"  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Two little kids at that -- at that age.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I mean one gets hard enough but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to have two.  Oh, my goodness!
L:  Yeah, I'm [SIGH] a little nervous about it.  But [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh, you'll be fine, now.
L:  -- oh, well.  [LAUGH]  But like I said, I -- I'm not going to know what's going on outside of my house if I don't [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, maybe I will get that high speed Internet so I can [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- get the news faster.  [SIGH]
R:  That's right.  That's what I was just going to say, you'd better be sure you have --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- that up and running when --
L:  I can --
R:  -- [SIGH] like you deliver.  [SIGH]
L:  -- always do the late night, [SIGH] um, news shows and things like that while I'm nursing and t- taking care of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] two little ones that I'm sure aren't going to --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- sleep through the night at first, like this one.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, brother, [SIGH] --
L:  But, ...
R:  -- I feel for you.  But well ... [SIGH]
L:  Oh, well -- well, it's -- it's what -- you know, I signed up for it so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  Yeah, that's right.  [SIGH]
L:  You know that's [NOISE] --
R:  Now was this -- was this -- was this, um, natural --
L:  No.
R:  -- twins?
L:  Well, no --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- no, it's --
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  -- in vitro.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  My son was in vitro too, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  But, um, --
R:  Wow!  Well --
L:  -- that's another place I get c- current events and things like that, when I go to ... the doctors they often have [SIGH] like medical update type things [SIGH] in there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and -- and, um, [NOISE] you know, things I never would have heard in the mainstream ... news.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Stuff like that.  [NOISE]
R:  That's very true.  Yeah.
L:  So, ... [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's a good -- that's a good point.  [SIGH]
L:  But ...
R:  And I guess I mean as far as that goes I hear a lot from my friend- -- my girl --
