L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE]  I didn't hear any tone but ... [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't either.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  My name is Linda.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, and I'm Marlene --
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  -- nice to meet you, [SIGH] ... Linda, [SIGH] on this -- in this way.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Where do you live?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  I live in New York.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  New York City.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I live in Portland, Oregon.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, we're about as far apart ... [LAUGH]
R:  As we could be in the States, right?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  I guess, ah, if you were in Hawaii we -- you would be a little further in away.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Or, [SIGH] Alaska maybe --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't know, I mean you're pretty far away.  How is it out there?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, actually it's really nice right now.
R:  That's great  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, [SIGH] the way I keep up with current events is, um, [LIPSMACK] I listen to the radio some.  I listen to the TV.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um, I a- also get on the Internet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  [NOISE]  And, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] I don't read the newspaper much.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I just think -- like I don't have time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  I see, uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  How about --
R:  [SIGH]  How much time you spend --
L:  [NOISE]  you?
R:  -- on the Internet?
L:  [NOISE]  Huh?  [SIGH]
R:  How much time to spend on the Internet?
L:  [NOISE]  Too much.  [LAUGH]
R:  Too much time, yes.  [SIGH]  But I guess you can r- read a lot on Internet?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, you can go to like different news sites, I mean, like you can go to CNN and [SIGH] [NOISE] -- and all your channel news sites and [SIGH] [NOISE] you can usually [SIGH] find out what's going on.  [NOISE]
R:  Yes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what's hitting the news anyway, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Sometimes --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Do you find out much from friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you talk to?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, sometimes if there's something big going on, [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] [NOISE] it'll, ah, pop up [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  -- but I don't know, otherwise I don't think so.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  What about you?
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I don't listen to the radio news much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, I do because my husband likes the TV -- listen to the TV.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I wouldn't -- if ever -- if I were living by myself I probably never turn the TV on.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  I'm with you there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  And your husband and my husband ought to get together.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  But, ah, they --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- but I do get, you know, kind --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- of caught up on the news of the TV.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And, um -- and -- and I don't do it all the time but I mean if I'm good listen to anything I kind of like to, you know, kind of touch base with it.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Although if I'm i- in the right frame of mind I could care less, to be honest with you.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, really sometimes you don't want to [LAUGH] hear the news.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  No, because, you know it's like r- really we're so much involved with the t- things --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- of the world instead of ... i- involved --
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- with what's coming from within.
L:  [NOISE]  Isn't that the truth.  [SIGH]
R:  So, ah, but I also do, ah, talk to folks and [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- I do learn quite a bit from t- those, especially those who are [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- much more in tune with the radio than I am.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I tend to read whatever I can get my hands on, but I don't subscribe to newspapers.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, I mean I tend to read but I mean, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- I mean, ah, [SIGH] I don't -- I don't subscribe to Time magazine or anything like that [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- and if I'm in a -- a doctor's office and I happen to see the Time magazine I always find it really interesting what they're saying --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, you know th- then I mean called in [SIGH] and I leave the magazine right where it is.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  So, I may not even finish the article.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, I get the Sunday paper and I do ... glance through it, kind of.  So, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  [LAUGH]  Like you say I [SIGH] --
R:  Is that a -- a local Portland paper?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, it's called the Oregonian.  [SIGH]
R:  I see, may I ... ask you how much that costs --
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- on Sundays there?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, a dollar fifty.  [SIGH]
R:  I see, 'cause the New York Times is, ah, a dollar every day and three fifty on Sundays.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my gosh!  [NOISE]  
R:  Yeah, so [SIGH] I just f- find that three fifty is just kind of exorbitant for a paper that I don't really have time to read.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, really!  Ours is, um, thirty five cents daily --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  -- and a dollar fifty on Sunday.
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  And I most -- the biggest reason I buy it is for the coupons.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there's something that will pay you back in a way, I guess.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, ah, well, that's news too, what's being sold where, right?
L:  [NOISE]  Right, that is!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Sometimes better news than ... [LAUGH]
R:  Than what you might be hearing otherwise?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I guess one thing I don't like about the news sometimes [NOISE] is they just [SIGH] [NOISE] keep saying the same things over and over and --
R:  Well, that's true, yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] I mean I guess I can understand a few times [NOISE] because not everybody might not get it the first time [SIGH] but, ah, [SIGH] ... sometimes I just --
R:  [MN]  When you hear it so many times you say, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  "Oh, I've had it -- had it with this I can't hear it anymore".
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Right.  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because they only give you two seconds of everything --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah!
R:  -- they don't give you any details anyway.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  And so it's sort of like a curiosity, like you're going to really learn something, but you don't learn much [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  -- I find.  But I did find that after, more or less this Iraqi --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know, problems, [SIGH] -- the problems, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, my husband and I were able to tune in more to more serious speaking on CNN, --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- C-SPAN and all that, we were able to listen to those people talk [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- which was, ah, you know, it felt like a change in my life had occurred.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I honestly haven't ... really looked at that much TV lately.  I don't even know if the opportunities to hear C-SPAN are quite as [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- quite as much as they were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at that time but it seemed like we were able to really listen to conversations of a nature that we had not been able to listen to before.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that's interesting.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I did find that kind of interesting [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm -- I don't know in terms of the current, um, news, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean I'm kind of just as interested in what's happening in the New York City government as I am, sort of, in the government --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the -- in the federal because we're living in New York City.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  Right.
R:  And there seems to be such a ... financial crisis going on right now that we're --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  -- [SIGH] that, you know, I sort of feel like it's helpful to know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what the city is saying --
L:  [NOISE]  Right, I'm with you --
R:  -- [SIGH] I mean there seems to be --
L:  [NOISE]  -- I wish sometimes we could hear more l- local ... news than --
R:  Yeah, do you have a -- a local sta- --
L:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
R:  -- ah, a- address about what's going on locally?
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  Um, [LIPSMACK] well this is like, ah, the capital of our Salem and in Salem they do have a newspaper called the [NOISE] Statesmen Journal --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  -- [SIGH] and it has [SIGH] [NOISE] oh, a lot more local news, I think, then, um, the Oregonian does.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH] But --
R:  But you have to read it.  You're not too much into reading, 'cause you don't have too much time right?
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But I can always go on line.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.
R:  Do you do that for the local, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, --
R:  -- ah, news?
L:  [NOISE]  -- even, yeah, the news -- some of the newspapers you can get to on line.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I do like to read, I mean I read books --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it takes me a while sometimes to get [LAUGH] through 'em --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, ah, [SIGH] I don't know I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] I like getting on the Internet better, I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's an interesting, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yesterday's my husband and I were upstate in -- in New York and [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, we, um, we -- there was a little, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there were a lot of little yard sales going on and -- and, you know, a- antique shows --
L:  [NOISE]  Ah.
R:  -- [SIGH] and there was a book there called, um, -- ah, what was it?  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have a copy of it [SIGH] -- its from [SIGH] Bill Gates and [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it was The Road -- The -- The Future Road --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or The Road Ahead, whatever [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he's talking about the super highway, the information highway.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  And he's -- I -- I don't think he's really talking about the Internet as being really the thing that he was discussing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think he was talking world wide web --
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  -- where you can get any information at all in the world.
L:  [NOISE]  Gosh!
R:  [SIGH]  And, ah, this book was published in nineteen ninety five and he was afraid that it would be laughed at in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in -- in ten years, you know, he said he wanted to the book to be considered --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, it was a serious book.  I think was ca- -- it's called The Road ahead.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And, ah, it's all about the super --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, it's -- it's about the, um, information --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, age which I guess we're in.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  And -- and I found it quite --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I -- I'm finding it quite interesting to read about it.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, yeah, you know you really can find out lots of intimation too on the Internet.  [SIGH]  I mean [SIGH] some pe- --
R:  Well, don't people can really lost, though, and spend an awful lot of time on the Internet, not getting to what they want?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, [SIGH] there are some that, um, I mean just like anything, I mean they go in there to [SIGH] goof around and go to chat rooms and stuff, [NOISE] [SIGH] but I don't really do that.  [NOISE]  I mean I've [SIGH] -- I've been on the computer for a long time and I've never been in a chat room --
R:  Really?  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  -- and I have no desire to go in one.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  But, you know, you can go like [SIGH] to a search engine and just type in a word, any word, you know, [SIGH] [NOISE] and, um, it'll bring up all kinds of places you can go to find out more about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what you're looking for.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  So, you can get some p- pretty broad section of information --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you can get maybe one viewpoint on this and another viewpoint?
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  Do you find there's a lot of duality in the information that you find [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- that way, [SIGH] do you find one thing contradicting another?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, sometimes.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  I think you just have to kind of know what you looking for.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  And maybe [SIGH] ignore some of the [LAUGH] --
R:  Ah -- ah, stuff.
L:  [NOISE]  -- stuff that you're not looking for.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]  But --
R:  I mean a- all I notice is that I do not use the Internet but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for instance on health issues --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- important health issues when you want to see [SIGH] what -- what's happening in certain research clinical Data and so forth and --
