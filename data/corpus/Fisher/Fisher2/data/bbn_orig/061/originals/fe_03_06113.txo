L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, uh --
L:  Do you want -- do you wanna go first, or do you want me to? [NOISE]
R:  Uh, you can go first.  I'm --
L:  Ok- --
R:  -- Joan and I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, my name is Deanne and I am actually in Utah.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So, [LAUGH] like we got a little distance between us.
R:  Yes, it [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Should be entertaining.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] So, okay.  So, they're asking us how we get our news.
R:  Yes.
L:  Our question.  Okay.  Um, I guess I can go first.  Fine.  Um, I kind of get a little bit of everything.  I'm kind of one of those news junkies.  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I, you know, didn't -- I will watch the evening news as well as like headline news and -- or CNBC and all that kind of stuff and also over the internet.  I get a lot of mine that way.  But --
R:  Well, I usually get mine from the TV and the newspaper.  I like, uh, MSNBC and CNN.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I -- I have to be honest I don't do -- I only do like Sunday newspaper.  I haven't -- just 'cause I have little kids so I don't have a chance to read it as much as I'd like to.  They [inaudible] college.  
R:  Well, I don't [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I really don't read the Sunday paper.  I do the daily.
L:  Oh, bless your heart.
R:  And I like the, uh, I like the editorials.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Those can be entertaining.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Giving you the full political spectrum. [NOISE] Oh, sorry, my -- I have a five[?] month old so she's fussing in the background.  You know why. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] So, do you find yourself drawn to any [NOISE] particular columnist or just general or ?
R:  I like Charlie Rhys.  I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if he's, um, just a local or -- or --
L:  Wha- --
R:  -- in my area.
L:  What was his name again?
R:  Uh, Charlie Rhys.
L:  I'm not familiar with him.
R:  Mhm.  He --
L:  So --
R:  -- usually does a pretty good column on just about everything.  Uh --
L:  Yeah?
R:  He's, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You can understand what he says.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, he -- he --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- puts it plain. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Instead of talking around all the subjects.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] That can make a big difference. [NOISE] Cool. [NOISE]
R:  But what did you think whenever, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the war was going on --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- about, uh, MSNBC and, uh, CB-, uh, CNN.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH].  What was my what?  I'm sorry. [inaudible] the background noise.
R:  What did you think about that?
L:  Well, I found in some ways it was, um, ad nauseam some ways.  The over coverage --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- of the news and especially -- 'cause I have a, um, a five and a six year old.  I was finding I needed to turn it off.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Because of -- of [NOISE] so much the graphic displays of whatnot and --
R:  Well --
L:  "Mom, why is that burning?"  Why don't -- you know, those kind of things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  I, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What I didn't like was, as you said, over c- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Over coverage --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And they kept talking on the same thing --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- without getting the facts right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, you'd find out a little bit later that that really wasn't what happened, that --
L:  Oh, jumping the g- -- jumping to conclusions and over analysis.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, big time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All these talking heads explaining to you why if this was happening and when they found the -- the -- the closest hint to a weapon of mass destruction.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then finding out, "Oh, we were wrong.  It was just fertilizer". [NOISE]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  And whatnot. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I have to admit I was -- I am glad for [NOISE] headline news because that -- I can get -- I can get the gist of what's happening.
R:  Right.
L:  But I feel like -- I don't know.  Have you noticed that if -- if you watch headline news at all, I feel like in the last few months they've kind of, I don't know, it's just not a serious news.  They've kind of like made it more poppy -- pop cultury. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  I don't know if I'm the only one [NOISE] that's noticed that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, anyway.  So, do you -- do you -- do you go on line at all for news sources, or ?
R:  No, I don't.  I'm just learning --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to use my computer and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mainly just go on for -- well, I do refunding and -- and that is the -- 
L:  Oh, how --
R:  -- what I go on there for.
L:  Oh, that's funny.  That's how I found about this study too. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] So, really that's about it.  I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm trying to learn.  You --
L:  Oh, bless your heart.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How fun.  I used to do some -- I used to do some polit- -- some -- actually political column stuff for a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- site and then, um, but yeah I do the couponing and refunding.  That's how I heard about this particular study.
R:  Yeah, that's I heard about [MN] really.
L:  So, how funny.  So, did you get it from Refunding Makes Sense?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes, that's where I [LAUGH] too.
R:  The chit chat. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, how funny.
R:  And they do come up with quite a bit of things on there.
L:  Yes, they do.  And so I saw this and I was like "Kind of interesting and fun to try".  So --
R:  Yeah, we were -- my husband was asking about the, um, [LIPSMACK] the cards.  He really was interested in the cards and to find out that some of them, you know, they're not real they're just knock offs and --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  So 
R:  So 
L:  Yeah, I just -- as a matter of fact I just really joined Refunding Makes Sense.  I haven't -- I did, uh, Refund Express for a while there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, um, I ran into a girl when I was out couponing who suggested I try this and I like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.  This is the one --
L:  And --
R:  -- I -- I stayed with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had tried different ones but then I stayed with this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the women are quite knowledgeable --
L:  [NOISE] Yes, quite --
R:  -- on a lot of different subjects.
L:  Yes.  Quite the store house.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, in fact I have the -- in fact I just like within the last week or so I haven't even posted on the chit chat, so   So, how fun.  Now, what was your first name again?
R:  Joan.
L:  Joan.  Okay, I'm Deanne.  So, now I [inaudible] Joan from Pennsylvania I'll remember now.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Have a new friend there.  Cool. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  So -- so, do you have good couponing where you're at, or ?
R:  Uh, some.  Not a lot.  
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  You know.  No forms.
L:  Oh, well we just actually got a store last month.  It's a Kroger's Own type one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they changed and they just started tripling once -- couple days [NOISE] a week.
R:  Oh, we don't have that. [LAUGH]
L:  This is brand new.  Before we'd get maybe once every six weeks.  If we were lucky a double.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Other [NOISE] than that nothing so it's been kind of fun having -- see I -- I started doing it when I was in California [NOISE] 'cause little ones and -- my little --
R:  We get, uh, we get doubles --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now to ninety nine.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's good.
R:  That just started.  We were getting only fifty, up to fifty.
L:  Oh, makes a big [NOISE] difference.  It's amazing little things you can start stockpiling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So  [NOISE] Yeah, so what does your husband think of your hobby?  Just kind of just roll his eyes or go, "Okay".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, he did. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, they -- they like the deals but they kinda go, "Oh, you're [inaudible]".
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.  But, yeah, and I --
R:  So --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  And I was just gonna say, so what other news things can we talk about here?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I was gonna say that I actually find that some of the online; if you get a chance, if you go to the particular websites, are actually entertaining and interesting. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Quite a lot of the columnists. [NOISE] That's why often -- did you say his name was Charlie Rhys?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, I'll have to go check it out later on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I'm not -- like I'm not familiar with him.  I do ma- -- I do a lot of like -- Dave Barry I grew up reading.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think he was funny.  And then like [NOISE], um, George Will.  I find him [NOISE] ener- ener- ener- educational too [NOISE] as well.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There are some other ones that I read too but he's the main one.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  He's -- like I said, he gives you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  He gives it to you plain.  You know.
L:  Yeah, does he have a -- does he have a political slant or is just kind of ?
R:  No, not -- I don't think so.  I mean, doesn't matter what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- party.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, he -- he puts everything right out there and -- and it makes you think, you know, and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I'm -- you've peaked my curiosity.  I'll definitely have to investigate like to the -- your paper website or something.  I'll do a search for him and see what we can find.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Charlie Rhys.  It sounds interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I'm not familiar with that name, but [NOISE]   'Cause even, you know, whether it be conservative or liberal I enjoy reading various ones.  Whatnot.
R:  Yeah, well we listen to channel four here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We get our news there.  But, um, I had started watching, you know, that MSNBC --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, some of it I like and some of it don't.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I know.
R:  It's just, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes it's just -- they just overdo.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I --
L:  The over analysis. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Over analysis on --
L:  The -- the talking heads.
R:  -- just about everything.  They had --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the -- you figure.  Well, the one good thing about it is the Elizabeth Smart.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.
R:  With -- with all the coverage of the war and everything --
L:  Yes.
R:  At least left her alone mostly.  
L:  Yes, wholly[?].
R:  So, that was, um --
L:  So --
R:  That was good.
L:  Yes.  And that whole thing was just so fra- crazy how they found her and all that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible].  That's -- that's a good thing they start to federalize that.
R:  Yes.
L:  That was a good thing with that.  So 
R:  And now they're having that, um, [LIPSMACK] Laci Peterson.
L:  Oh, I know.  Oh, that one.  Yes, that's big time overkill.
R:  That's -- that's terrible.  Mm, yeah, that's overkill and it's -- what happened is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- terrible.  You know, it just --
L:  Oh, of course it's terrible.  I'm not trying to say that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  But it's, um, there's just always something in there.  They're always, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- breaking news and there's nothing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nothing new.  It's just --
L:  No.  No. [MN] Excuse me. [MN] I'm gonna yawn.  Let's see.  What else? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, what about radio?  Do you happen to --
R:  No, I really don't --
L:  Not much.
R:  -- um, listen to the radio.  My -- we use that m- mostly for music.  My husband --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- likes Polka music.
L:  I'm sorry, he what?
R:  He likes Polka music.  So, really --
L:  Oh, that's too fun.
R:  Yeah, on Saturday --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he listens to Polka going on. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, how fun.  Yeah --
R:  But us- -- I don't usually bother with the radio.
L:  Yeah, see once in a great while [NOISE] we will, you know, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get the headlines or something at the half -- the half hour or whatever.  But, [NOISE] like you, it's more for music and ours is Radio Disney so that tells you.
R:  You what?
L:  We listen to Radio Disney.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  And there's not much news on there that, you know, other than [SIGH], you know, the latest [NOISE] --
R:  We love Disney. [LAUGH]
L:  Latest, you know, Justin Timberlake update [NOISE] or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's [NOISE] -- I guess that it wasn't until I had kids that I found my mus- -- habits changing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's why -- that's probably the reason I like the inter-
