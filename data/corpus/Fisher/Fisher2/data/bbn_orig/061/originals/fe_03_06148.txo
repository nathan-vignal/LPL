R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi!
L:  Hi, my name is Robyn.
R:  Hi, I'm Dana.
L:  Ah, where -- where are you located?
R:  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, I'm in Pennsylvania.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, well this is the first time I've done this [NOISE] so I'm not quite --
L:  Oh, ah, this is my second.  [MN]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I haven't been available.  I've had messages on my machine but this the, ah -- ah, first time I've been home in a while.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  And our topic of the day is, um, how do we get our news?  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Right, well [SIGH] I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get mine mostly from television, newspaper, magazines.
L:  [SIGH]  Do you have a specific channel that you watch?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  No --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't [SIGH] and h- how about you?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, [MN] I gen- -- I like to watch the news in the morning, ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- before I go to work.  I usually have it on while I'm [SIGH] getting dressed and ready.  And then, um, [COUGH] [SIGH] in the evening [SIGH] I try and watch the local news and then let that fall right into, ah, national n- news.  I like Peter Jennings so [SIGH] I try to s- stick to ABC.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I see.  [SIGH]
L:  Sometimes if there's a world event, um, going on I -- I'll [NOISE] tune into CNN [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to see if they have any more insight on something that's going on.  But [SIGH] generally if it's, you know, an ordinary day I'll -- I'll stick to television.  [SIGH]  Um, I generally get a news paper on the -- Sunday paper on the weekends [SIGH] and, um, that's mostly [SIGH] [NOISE] local --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- more than regional.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm about [SIGH] thirty miles outside of Philadelphia [SIGH] and --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- so I don't get a Philadelphia newspaper.  I generally get my [NOISE] -- my local newspaper on Sunday.  [MN]
R:  I see.  I see.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause we, ah, [LIPSMACK] l- live in the Eldorado Hills which is a- about thirty m- miles --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- away from Sacramento [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and about two hours away from San Francisco.
L:  [MN]  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  But [SIGH] I just get the Sacramento paper and -- and a lot of people I know get the, ah, San Francisco paper --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but I don't have time to read it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, sometimes there's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of stories in there that don't really p- pertain to our local area.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but generally if there's -- you know, a world event or even a state event that's important I'll [SIGH] -- I'll try and get a paper more often.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  Um, magazines, not so much any more.  I used to but I have [LAUGH] two kids that keep me [NOISE] pretty busy.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've got two kiddos too.  So, ...
L:  I have to be pretty selective about when I sit down.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause I used to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I, ah, my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reads -- reads them religiously --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I read 'em sporadically.  But --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I used to read US News and World Report religiously since I was eighteen, [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  I do too for --
R:  -- and I'm forty four now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, I did too for a long time, [NOISE] ah -- um, after college [NOISE] for several years.  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And, um, [COUGH] -- and I had Time Magazine for a while which I like because their stories were a little more indepth.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, ah, [SIGH] really at this point I don't [SIGH] -- I don't know if I get any magazine subscriptions.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh!
L:  I teach school so a lot of times --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- if there's something I want to read, [SIGH] I'll go to the library and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] and read right in our library.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, ... [SIGH] yeah, I, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- well th- -- I don't guess the New Yorker would be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- considered current events.  I mean they kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talk about current --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- events, but they talk about a lot of other stuff too.
L:  [MN]  Right.
R:  So, ...
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  But I get that and -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I really would like to get the Economist, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to kind of get a different view --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of world events.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I just simply --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't keep up with what I have --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to read.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, i- i- it really is hard to find the time, that's why I think I like the news in the evening.  When I'm [SIGH] preparing dinner I can do two things at once and [SIGH] and c- catch something there.  If a story catches my eye then I can take a few minutes to stop.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's not like I [SIGH] can spend the whole time just [SIGH] sitting and, [SIGH] you know, taking the whole thing in.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yes, I --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I think that's more of an issue for me is the time issue.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I think it is for most people, yes.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  Yes.  I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know a lot of people, like, listen to the radio, [SIGH] like, in their commute to and from work.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  You -- that's a good point.  I go through phases with that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, a- ah, -- y- -- for a while I was listening to ... public radio [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and, [NOISE] um, [SIGH] you know, [MN] I guess I go through [SIGH] [NOISE] different phases.  This year I -- I'm listening to Christian [LAUGH] radio station on my way to work.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  Sometimes I can get our local news [SIGH] c- channel on ... a radio station.  Can you get that [MN] ... at all?  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, ... no.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] we can get --
R:  You mean like a television station.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Yeah we can --
R:  No.
L:  -- [NOISE] get one television [NOISE] c- channel on [SIGH] radio.  [NOISE]  ABC is the only one that [NOISE] -- that s- seems to be smart enough to do that.  [SIGH]
R:  Huh, [SIGH] --
L:  And I really like --
R:  -- that's interesting.
L:  -- it because [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I can h- hear news sometimes.  [MN]  [SIGH]  Um, [NOISE] and when I used to take my kids to piano lessons I would sit and listen to Oprah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH]  That's funny.  [NOISE]
L:  That was kind of fun.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yes.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'll have to [SIGH] be more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pay attention --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and see if that's available in this area.  But I -- I --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I've not heard of it.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, huh, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of neat.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm a stay at home mom --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I don't do a lot of commuting.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  So, I, ah, I don't listen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I mean, I've got teenagers now so --
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, well, that still keeps --
R:  -- [SIGH] when we're in the car it's --
L:  -- you busy.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  It's this terrible rotten noise that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming out of the radio.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Yeah, you almost want to kind of block it out.  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Oh!
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.  [SIGH]
R:  So, um, gosh [SIGH] so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are we supposed to talk until ...
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, they'll give us a signal when, um, [NOISE] [MN] when our time period is up --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, [NOISE] [MN] I've even [SIGH] when we've done this before have gotten off topic [NOISE] and [MN] just [SIGH] continued to go.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is that right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  [MN]  Ah, um, [MN] h- how old are your kids?
R:  Um, I've got a fourteen and a thirteen year old.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, that k- keeps you pretty busy.  [NOISE]  That's -- that's the age I teach.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I teach metal school students.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  And, um, [MN] yeah -- yeah they're fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, they are fun.  [LAUGH]
L:  They -- they're very lively.  [SIGH]  I have a [SIGH] nine year old and an eleven year old myself.  So ...  [NOISE] --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh!
L:  -- [NOISE] they're keeping me pretty busy too.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, your time's coming and it won't be l- long.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I know.  [NOISE]
R:  But they're probably still into all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the sports and everything, right?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, actually they're just -- my kids are just starting.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh!
L:  They didn't ... take a liking to it when they were younger but, [SIGH] um, they're starting to now and that's fine with me.  I didn't want to [SIGH] start them too early and, you know, there's a lot of pressure here for [SIGH] -- for kids to be involved with sports and then there's [SIGH] pressure to p- play in college, and [NOISE] what have you.  And --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- I just --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- [SIGH] didn't want to get them started on that track.  I --
R:  No.
L:  -- wanted them to play for fun.  [NOISE]
R:  Absolutely!
L:  [NOISE]  So, they're -- they're finding [SIGH] s- something on their own.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  That's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, actually it's funny -- you said you were outside of Philadelphia?
L:  Yes.
R:  So, -- 'cause I have a good friend that lives in, ah, New Jersey, right outside of Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you know what town?
R:  Mount Holly.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, that's not far.  Yeah, that's [NOISE] not far from Philadelphia at all.  [SIGH]  It's, um, [MN] -- wow, that's [SIGH] -- that's quite a distance to keep a good friendship going.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, we were -- we met each other in college.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- periodically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I tend to come up there more than she tends to come out here.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  But [SIGH] it's very sporadic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but we talk to each other at least --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a c- -- once or twice --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a month.  [SIGH]
L:  Well that's good.
R:  Yeah.  Ye- --
L:  That's really good.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is.
L:  'Cause I know I don't keep in touch with some of my [COUGH] college or [SIGH] -- or high school --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- friends --
R:  Well it --
L:  -- that often.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's hard too.
L:  [NOISE]  Good for you.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Good for you.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, in fact, ah, -- they're -- gosh, you know what, I was supposed to come out there in February and I forgot all about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  She had mentioned there was some exhibit showing at the Philadelphia Museum that she thought I would l- like.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, there -- there's ... tons of good stuff --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- as there would be, you know, in Sacramento too, I'm sure.  [SIGH]
R:  No, there's nothing.
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH]  It's terrible.  [LAUGH]
L:  For the state capital that's surprising.
R:  [SIGH]  I know but it's a -- real small, I mean, you know --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  -- it's -- it's --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  -- ah, w- we've got a little museum [SIGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but it doesn't get any of the big -- big things that tour around or anything.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] yeah, we have to drive into San Francisco to get that.
L:  How far is that?
R:  [SIGH]  It's a two hour drive.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, that's -- that's a pretty good ride.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean it makes for a long day --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- it really does.
L:  You do it but it's not [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] advisable, right?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, you know, so it is -- it is nice to be able to go in and -- you know, if you want to spend the night there or whatever.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It makes a nice little trip.
L:  Okay.
R:  But [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it can get cold too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Well, I'll ask you a couple of more questions about our topic [NOISE] I ... just thought of.  [SIGH]  Where do you think, um, [NOISE] most of your friends, [NOISE] or neighbors, get their current events [NOISE] or current news from?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I would sa- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh!  [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would prob- -- just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from what they say I would guess the television, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, either national news --
L:  [NOISE]  I'm thinking the same thing.  I don't see a lot of newspapers [NOISE] in driveways like I used to.  [NOISE]
R:  Is that right?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, and [NOISE] we're a pretty rural area so most people would get it delivered but, [SIGH] yeah, I -- I don't s- see that ... like I used to when, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] um, we first moved into this area.
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  I would see newspapers in [NOISE] -- in people's driveways e- every morning [NOISE] on the way, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and a lot of times I would pass the [SIGH] delivery person.  So, I'm --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- tending to think the same thing [NOISE] [SIGH] that it would, ah, [SIGH] the news -- ah, television.
R:  Well, it's funny -- yeah, 'cause I'm in a real suburban area --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] and, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- y- yeah, we see newspapers out every morning, --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- we still do.  Now, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if people are actually reading them or, [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, some people I've heard they say they get the newspaper --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to find out what's on sale, you know, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and for the coupons --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH]  Oh, [SIGH] and with cable TV anymore [SIGH] there's so many channels to get --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- your news from.
R:  [SIGH]  That's true.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, we used to be so confined to just the major [SIGH] three networks.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now, [SIGH] you know, you can get [SIGH] all kinds of news channels all over the cable.  [SIGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  And, um ...
R:  That is true.
L:  Yeah, you can have your choice of personalities and [MN] we used to be--
R:  Yeah.  'cause, like, my husband likes to watch Fox News --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] during the day, you know?
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, [LAUGH] so ... [SIGH] I get tired of it, though.  I --
L:  [SIGH]
