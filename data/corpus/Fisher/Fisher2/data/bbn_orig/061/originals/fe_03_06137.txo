R:  Hi!  [MN]
L:  Hi, I'm Janet.
R:  Hi, I'm Pamela.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And, um, are we supposed to say where we're from?
R:  [LAUGH]  It doesn't matter.  No, [LAUGH] it doesn't matter.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If you want too, sure!
L:  All right.  Well, I live in, ah, northern Virginia.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!  How north in ... Virginia?
L:  Well, near Washington DC.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  My son lives in Burke.
L:  Oh, not too far.  [SIGH]
R:  And his mother in law lives in Falls Church.
L:  In where?
R:  Falls Church.
L:  That's where I live.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yes.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  What you know?
R:  Yeah, I'm in Syracuse, New York.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  I --
L:  Love the snow?
R:  About a seven and a half hour drive [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- which we're about to make [SIGH] for the baby's birthday.
L:  Oh!
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, do you keep up with news?
L:  Um, yes.  [SIGH]  I primarily read the newspaper.
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  Yeah, our -- our newspaper is politically oriented, so we don't [LAUGH] read the newspaper.
L:  Ah.  [SIGH]
R:  I [SIGH] -- I -- I listen to the radio.  Ah, my husband [SIGH] listens to the -- the r- radio and the television --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and then he tells me what I should know.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  It's a very old-fashioned relationship.  [LAUGH]
L:  National public radio?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, he --
L:  Or local?
R:  -- he's um, he's -- he does listen to that.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But he's a little --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a little off on that just now too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, my -- my husband and I don't talk politics because we --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] we don't agree on politics so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we -- we don't -- he -- he actually watches T-- the -- the te- television news --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause he doesn't have the time in the morning, but I get up at five thirty in the morning to read the paper.
R:  Oh, bless your heart, what in the world are you doing so awake?
L:  Well, my husband's up anyway.
R:  Oh!
L:  It's -- commuting around here is --
R:  I know.
L:  -- the earlier you get going the better so ...  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, Lord, I tried it once, you know, I figured --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- well, there's got to be a break in the traffic some point in the day.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  No, [SIGH] [LAUGH] it's not true.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, actually there's, um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- there are -- I know exactly the times that [SIGH] are best to get to some places.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, the kids have lived there --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- for four years now --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and they haven't figured it out.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh!
R:  Now my daughter has a job she has to be there, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, at a particular moment.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But my son, [LIPSMACK] he owns Certified Diamond in ... Falls Church.
L:  [SIGH]  Okay, I know where that is.  [SIGH]
R:  And, um, [SIGH] he doesn't have to be anywhere, at a particular moment, and he still can't figure it out.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, the -- um, I think if it's on Route Seven, which I think is, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- then th- -- Route Seven's never good except Sunday morning.  So, ...
R:  Oh!
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's a p- particularly bad street.
R:  He's o- he's open on Sunday.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay, well then ...
R:  There was a moment when he tried to be open by appointment only and then --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- he d- decided nobody else was open so maybe --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- he -- he could do some business if he were open.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, mm, you never know.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You've got to try things out.
L:  [SIGH]  Yep.
R:  So, he did.
L:  So, um, you get enough -- do you -- follow both international and domestic news?  [SIGH]
R:  Frankly, my dear, [SIGH] no.  [LAUGH]  It's like history to me.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And those were never my strong suit.  [SIGH]  I don't really, you know, if I lived in a cave it wouldn't matter.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  News is not important to me.
L:  Well, we like it when we go on vacation and we get no news but I feel [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's important to keep up with what's happening.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, that's what my husband feels.  So he fills me right in.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I also do a lot -- I keep very close track of the local news and try to participate and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I read the local newspaper thoroughly, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and [SIGH] try to keep up on what's going on --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- in my neighborhood and ... [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't -- I have to admit I don't re- -- I read the headlines of it -- of world news but I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] I just [SIGH] ... don't go read all the articles.  It's [SIGH] usually very depressing.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  I listen to CNN, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- on the t- television if I ... bother to walk past the television.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But I like NPR and he doesn't so we have discussions over [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- what I learned, versus what he knows to be the truth.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  We occasionally get into ... politics [SIGH] and, ah, while we are both on the same side occasionally, [SIGH] um, I [LIPSMACK] -- I choose to think that -- that NPR is not quite as -- as left as he thinks it is.
L:  I -- I will listen to NPR when I'm in the car and --
R:  [SIGH]  Yes.
L:  -- I like music but when the n- news comes on I don't have much choice.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, me either.
L:  But it's ...  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I don't hop around I just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I listen to it, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] Ye- --
R:  -- so I learn something.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, Wa- Washington Post is a really good newspaper.
R:  Is it?
L:  And -- yeah, I mean, I -- I -- I'm -- there are other sections [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- that I get other kinds of news that are [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not necessarily political news and, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] now it's, um, [SIGH] I mean I -- I think it's a -- a good -- a good newspaper.  Th- that's why I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I read it but, um ...  [SIGH]
R:  Well, we -- we had a nice, um, [SIGH] radio station around here that actually played oldies but goodies.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And that turned into talk radio and there's practically nothing but talk radio.  [SIGH]  And everybody on talk radio [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- has the same ... b- bent --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and it's hard.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I like listening when I can th- that day about --
R:  Except our neighbors --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they keep us right up to date.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  My husband is about as far right as you can get and ... they're about as far left.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I did see a nasty bumper sticker that they have just applied [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to their car, fortunately.  Ah, I think it goes --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a -- a little beyond good taste, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]
R:  -- but otherwise it's [SIGH] kind of interesting --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to have discussions with them.  [SIGH]  Um --
L:  Yeah, we -- we tend to avoid p- politics in this area because people get [SIGH] heated.  But what I like -- I like to listen to f- foreign [SIGH] -- the foreign radio, the French radio.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And when I -- when I'm in the car between seven and nine in the morning [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and it's, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, it's really interesting hearing their perspective, [SIGH] 'cause it's a European perspective.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, that's exactly what my husband said --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- because between eight and eight thirty h- here, [SIGH] we get, um, the German TV n- news.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  And he says it's s- so different from what, you know, we get here.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  We get what they want us to hear.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  We don't necessarily get the whole story.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, well [SIGH] --
R:  Have you found that that's the truth?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, that -- I mean definitely, I mean they have different perspectives --
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and, [SIGH] um, we get -- m- my house we'll watch sometimes f- foreign television on the TV because he watches the TV at night.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But this is t- the radio and it's actually in French but I -- I [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- speak French so ...  [SIGH]
R:  Well, th- that's wonderful.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That's excellent.  When -- and he speaks German so, [SIGH] he listens to the German --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [MN] news and he enjoys it very much.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it makes a good counterpoint to the American news, --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- judging on all -- like everything that was in the paper was all [SIGH] war related.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And I didn't want to hear about it anymore.  So, ...
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [SIGH]  They just give different [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they h- have a whole di- different way of doing things.  We tend to do things in bits and bites [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- in our news and in Europe and France, at least, [LIPSMACK] they'll do whole long [MN] in- interviews and so on.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean it's a whole different way of looking [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- looking at the news.
R:  I -- I do wish I had a brain that could comprehend [LAUGH] another language.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I'm just lucky I can speak English.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, well, I mean, that's what I spent my time ... s- studying and learning.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  It didn't just come.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I'm trying for Italian --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but it's not coming.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  My husband says just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- just keep at it because, you know, an active brain is a young brain.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  Use it or lose it.  So, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that's what we try and do.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I keep -- I keep busy.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I try to.  [SIGH]
R:  But you -- you're --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- good to keep up with the news.  I don't.  And, ah, [SIGH] [MN] you know every once in a while he says, "What's the weather tomorrow?"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't know.  I don't care.  I don't --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- even believe that the weatherman knows what the weather is tomorrow.  So, ... [SIGH] I just --
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah, the weather ... I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I take that with a grain of salt.  But [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]  So, I'm sort of [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's bad when one knows.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I do -- can do --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- one thing in life [SIGH] and that's all I care about and, ah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, everybody else leaves me alone, you see [SIGH] they figure I'm not I- intelligent enough to be spoken to so it's just fine.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't care.
L:  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I know, I just -- I -- I think it's -- [SIGH] I mean the only news I discuss with people is the local issues because we have to -- you know, w- we actually can have an impact on the local --
R:  Mm.  [SIGH]
L:  -- what -- what's happening locally because [SIGH] --
R:  I don't think we can around here.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's e- extremely difficult.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Some terrible things are happening around here --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and -- and nobody listens ... to the [SIGH] -- to the people.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They just do -- they just do what they want.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "Oh, you voted for us so we're gonna do what we're gonna do.  Never mind what you want".  It's dreadful.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, the city of Falls Church is -- is rather ... o- odd.  I mean it's very, very small.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It has its own government and everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, [SIGH] people can [SIGH] have an impact.  [SIGH] I mean --
R:  I know you can't even p- park on the street --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if you don't have a s- sticker.
L:  Oh, no, no, Falls Church you don't need a sticker [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]  He --
L:  -- [SIGH] not in the city.
R:  -- he says he needs one.
L:  It -- he may be in g- greater Falls Church but not in the city itself.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  Because, um, [SIGH] ah, I know in -- ne- -- um, [SIGH] ju- -- r- real near us, nearer -- nearer the Metro you have to have a sticker, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- that's Fairfax County.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  That's not Falls Church.  It's very confusing.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  What do you say.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, [SIGH] [LAUGH] --
R:  I get confused just getting on the loop there --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- loop -- the outer loop --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- where do they go.  Don't they connect somewhere?  Ah --
L:  I don't -- I don't drive on the highway --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I avoid the problems.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, they're -- they're moving --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- to, um --
L:  Thank you Stephanie, in a minute.  [SIGH]  Sorry.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, no, that's okay.  [SIGH]  They're moving to Falls Church.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Hopefully, they'll --you know, have sold their house by --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- Christmas time [SIGH] but, um, they're just tired of the commute [SIGH] because my daughter in law works ten minutes from her mother's house.
