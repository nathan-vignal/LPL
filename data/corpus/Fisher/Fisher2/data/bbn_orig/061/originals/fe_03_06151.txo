R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi!  I didn't hear a tone, did you?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  No, I didn't.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I'm Joanne.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Hi, Joanne, I'm Jo.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, h- hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  Pleased to meet you.  [SIGH]
L:  Nice to meet you, too.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, we're going to talk about current events?
R:  I guess we do.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, I get mine -- usually I try to read USA Today.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then I watch a little bit of, ah, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- CNN when I get home [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or usually before going to work.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I listen to the [NOISE] [SIGH] -- kind of listen to it while I'm getting ready for work in the morning also.  [SIGH]
R:  Yep, that's me too.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  And then I have, um, AOL.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  And I read it there but then also I have it set up so that at noon every day [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- AOL sends me a text message of the, um, c- current headlines.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh!  Now can you do that from work?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Do you do it at work or ...?  [MN]
L:  It just goes off on my cell phone wherever I'm at, at noon.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  I just set it up on my -- on my AOL that they're to do it.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, I see.  [SIGH]
L:  I don't remember how I did it but [LAUGH] I did and it comes in every day.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay.  Well, [MN] [NOISE] I don't --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- have that on my cell -- that's not a feature on my cell phone.  [NOISE]  So, ... [SIGH]
L:  Text messaging?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
R:  I've got an old one.  [SIGH]  So [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just for emergency purposes only.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, ... oh!  [NOISE]  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]  [NOISE]
R:  So, I'm out of the loop when that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, with that.  [SIGH]  So, ...  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, it comes in handy.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  It does, it comes in handy.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I -- I do watch, um, [LIPSMACK] I watch the TV.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I listen to it in the morning and, then, [SIGH] u- usually as I'm drifting off to sleep at eleven o'clock at night I l- listen to it.  And then, [SIGH] of course, there's always the water cooler conversation of what happened at -- you know, in the news and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everybody talking about that.  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I get it in all of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- aforementioned places that the [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the [SIGH] a- announcer [LAUGH] talked about.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  A- and she was saying you know, t- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- personally saying on t- the news, the radio, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] sometimes I listen to the radio on the way in because I want to hear the traffic.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, [MN] [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I do that too.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- 'cause I am [NOISE] -- I -- I just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- our doctor's [SIGH] -- I work for a physician's office and they just moved our practice down to Bellbrook and [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's, like, fifty five minutes from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where I'm at.  So --
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  -- I'm always listening for the traffic r- [LAUGH] report.  [SIGH]  So, I kind of like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- surf back and forth to get that.  [NOISE]  So, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- 'cause it's like I have to drive through f- five counties to get to work.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh!  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, and I'm -- you know, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I've just been doing that for about two weeks and I hate it already.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Is that mostly traffic too?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's interstate, yeah.  [MN]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yep, so I -- I go on three different interstates to get there.  So, [NOISE] [MN] it's like crazy but, yeah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I listen to the radio.  Definitely.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, ... [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, and when they say what's going on up ahead you know where you can cut off and go around it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah, I've got several different ways --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I can go so that makes it nice.  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- always trying to listen to that.  [SIGH]  So, ...  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And I don't have an alternate route.  I can only go one way.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  No.  So, even if I do listen to it and they tell me [SIGH] -- it's like [NOISE] if I can hear it b- before it's time to go [NOISE] I can get out a few minutes early.  But [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the car I'll listen to it just to hear w- why are we so slow this morning.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Now, where do you live?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Southern California.
R:  Oh, wow!  Okay, 'cause I'm in D- Dayton, Ohio.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
R:  So, ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I'm about half an hour east of Disneyland.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, wow!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  My husband has s- some family that live in Santa --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] ana I think.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] Santana [MN] but I've never been there.  So ... [MN]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Never been there.
L:  You've never been to California or you've never been to Santana?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Never been to California, period.  [MN]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, you should come at least once.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  That's -- well, that's what I told my husband 'cause, [NOISE] you know, he does have family there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I said it'd be, you know, kind of [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- neat to go and just to visit.  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He'd have a place to stay but we haven't made it there yet.  So, ... [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, there's quite a time difference then [SIGH] ... for you, right?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, it's like ... almost ten to six here.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]  [MN]  [NOISE]  Well, it is --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's, ah, ten to nine here.  So, --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
R:  -- so it's like three --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] almost three hours.  [SIGH]
L:  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, so,  ... [NOISE]  Now, this is my first time ever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing this.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  This is my third.
R:  [NOISE]  Is it?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And I don't even remember signing up for it.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  I thought, "Well, it must be of benefit to us so I'll go ah- -- go on [LAUGH] with it" [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't remember what the, um [NOISE] [MN] what the gimmick is.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, [MN] I think my daughter in law probably signed me up for this.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I think she's the one.  The culprit.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  She's like, [SIGH] "If you don't know any" -- you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, ah -- she said like you can listen and if you don't [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah ... know anything about the subject then you don't have to do it.  You can just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- c- call another day.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I was like, "Okay".  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, so she knows about it and she probably participates?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  She does.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, and -- I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- just like, "Well, how ...?"  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I'm trying to figure out how it all works.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't know.  We'll see.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, do you have the Internet?
R:  Um, [SIGH] yes, but by the time I get home [SIGH] it is the last thing on my mind trying to --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- wo- -- you know, get on it.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh!
R:  [NOISE]  So, ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  But, um, [NOISE] yeah, I -- I [NOISE] you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I'm just kind of -- that's the last thing I want to do.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, so that helps me to unwind [SIGH] at the end of the day.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!  [SIGH]
L:  You get into the -- to the web and start looking things up and researching and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you just f- forget about all your -- your woes of the day.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Now do you work on a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a computer during the day?  [SIGH]
L:  No.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  See I do with patients so [SIGH] I'm like that -- I -- I think, you know, if I didn't work on one [SIGH] then I probably would, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  you know, do it more when you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- get home.  [MN]  But since I'm on one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- virtually all day, [SIGH] you know, I never -- that's just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the last thing on my mind when I get home.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  Looking into another monitor.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  O- oh!
L:  [SIGH]  No, I'm saying you don't want to look into another monitor --
R:  No.  No.
L:  -- at the end of the day.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [SIGH]  News or any -- you know, no, [NOISE] I don't.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, that's kind of [NOISE] -- [SIGH] now i- is there a like a buzzer that goes off that tells us when our times is up?  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  There's -- ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll be a little beep and say that, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we have thirty minute -- ah, thirty seconds to say goodbye.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Okay.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, see, [NOISE] you know more than I do already --
L:  [NOISE]  I've had --
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  -- more time at it, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, you know ...  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, see I use -- AOL not only for, ah, myself ... to send me text messaging but, [SIGH] um, I do go in and read the headlines and, --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, go on to CNN [SIGH] on line [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  -- and read things.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  It -- it -- it kind of gives you more, um, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] i- it gives -- to me you g- get, ah, -- a better view of what's going on other than just your local ... news.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  You know what it --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I -- yeah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now, when I -- I -- I -- I [SIGH] very seldom, you know, watch ... [NOISE] our regular news.  It's always [SIGH] like CNN or, um, MSNBC [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and especially since everything that's going on I'm just like totally, [NOISE] you know, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's like glued [SIGH]  [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know.  [NOISE]  And then I'll switch to [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like Larry King, [SIGH] you know, a- and get that.  But, um, [MN] mostly I just, -- you know, I read our local paper and then I -- I subscribe to USA Today, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause my husband used to work there.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh!
R:  So, -- [NOISE] [MN] and I got hooked on it and then when he left there and went with another company I'm like, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] "Now I have to get a subscription".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, [MN] -- but, um, [NOISE] yeah, if I watched any television at all it's usually really the news [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and that's no -- no kidding.  So, --  [NOISE]
L:  Well I -- I seldom watch a- all that much TV but, um, my daughter and my two grandsons came to live with me almost a year ago [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so they have the TV on a lot more.  And I catch myself, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, getting into programs and watching things but [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I was here by myself I very seldom [SIGH] -- well I should have said I would turn it on but it was just background noise.  I didn't sit and watch anything.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!  [NOISE]  [MN]
L:  And in fact with the news it's more of, you know, I just listen to it more than watch it.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh, [SIGH] really?
L:  [SIGH]  Although with the -- with the war and everything I did -- I was glued to that.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And then I always, um -- like on Saturday [NOISE] I was -- I would never leave the house till I watched, um, [SIGH] Solo Dad and David Blume[?] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and then when h- he died I was just like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I was in s- shock.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I couldn't believe it.  [SIGH]  I could not believe it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, during the weekends I watch the Food Channel.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, do you?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]  Well, because I have time on the weekends to cook more.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  And so I -- I like watching that and it kind of gives me ideas.  Maybe something I want to cook that day or the next, you know, on Sunday.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  We get, um -- It's Gourmet and then we get another magazine at work.  So, I kind of, like, scan through that and look at that, [SIGH] you know.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  That's -- that's another way too I keep c- current.  I -- I, um, do like Newsweek and Time Magazine and -- and [SIGH] those things.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't --
L:  You have a doctor's office that actually has current magazines in it?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yep.  Yep, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they do.  The get [NOISE] ah, -- oh, gosh they get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, Style which is really a nice magazine [SIGH] and, um, Architectural Digest.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They really get a lot of [NOISE] nice magazines.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, [NOISE] many ti- -- so, ...  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Oh, usually they [NOISE] -- they either don't have any magazines or they're way outdated.  And I think [SIGH] people from the office brought 'em in from home 'cause they felt sorry for the patients, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Oh, no.  [SIGH]  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Our guys are [SIGH] -- our guy are a good group.  They -- [NOISE] they, um, they've got tons of magazines and newspapers.  They get, um, [NOISE] Wall Street Journal.  [NOISE]  And, ah, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Oh, shoot [SIGH] ah, [NOISE] I don't know.  They don't get USA but they get the local papers so [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, [NOISE] --
