R:  Which one?  The poetry one?
L:  Um, no, she has -- she has one Gather Together My Name and, uh, Singing and -- Singing and Swinging to Getting Merry Like Christmas.  I think that's good because the Singing and Swinging, Getting Merry Like Christmas is when she was in Porgy and Bess.
R:  Mhm.

R:  [MN]
L:  -- in a -- in the play Porgy and Bess, she was a dancer.  And it tells about her experiences, it's really good.

R:  Well, I do -- whenever I have time.
L:  [NOISE] You mean whenever you have time?
R:  It's not really like specifically.
L:  Oh okay, well, since I'm opening my own business and I refuse to work for anyone else [LAUGH] I have a lotta time!  So, um --
R:  That's good that you don't have to depend on other people.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I just can't -- I had a job, uh, a couple of months ago but I just -- I couldn't take it, I'm not -- I can take -- take instructions and directions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- very well but I -- I don't like, take the questioning and, "Why did you do this?" [NOISE] and, "Why did you do that?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I'm -- I'm a free spirit, I'm used to doing what I wanna do, so it wasn't good for me.
R:  But, see --
L:  But I spend like, uh, [LIPSMACK], um, a couple a hours each day.  A couple of hours each day, try to at least do four.
R:  That's really god.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And is there anything else that you like doing?
L:  Um ... yeah, well, I write poetry too.  Watch out, cat!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Every time I get on the phone this cat comes! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh gosh.
L:  Go, cat!  My daughter loves cats -- I love cats too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [NOISE] yeah.  I, um, write poetry.  I haven't written any lately, I usually wait until like, the mood comes or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I feel inspired, then I write because that's when it comes out of me.  I try to keep something by my bed, like a pen and a pa- pa- piece of paper.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  Then I wake up sometimes with poetry in my mind.
R:  Oh, that's real nice.
L:  Yeah.  You write poetry?
R:  No, I wish. [LAUGH]  I -- like, I how -- I think of all stuff but I don't really like, write it down.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's just things that come to my head but not -- I mean, I should but I don't -- I don't do it.
L:  Yeah, you should 'cause it's just -- it's -- it's -- it's only gonna be there for a minute!
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, [MN].
L:  [LAUGH] Gotta write it down while you think about it.
R:  Yeah, 'cause then you forget.  No, I [inaudible] --
L:  Most people that write -- most people that read, write.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, like if you ever read or, uh, it's -- it's like, I don't know, go hand in hand and write.  So you just haven't written anything down, you can write.  Get away cat!  Oh my God! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This cat is ridiculous.
R:  Oh my.
L:  And, uh, do we think everybody should have hobbies?  You go first.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  The la- -- the last subject was, "Do you think everybody should have hobbies?"
R:  Well, I mean, i- it helps because like, it's like a therapy, let's say you're stressing, do what you like doing for your release.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whatever, seeing you have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't think it's like, necessary.  It's -- it's really good but it's not like, something you have to do.  What if you don't like doing anything?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  That's [inaudible].
R:  So I -- I guess it's up to a person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it --
L:  I --
R:  -- it does help though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  I think everybody should have one because I know everybody's interested in something.  But it's gonna be something that you like to do, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can't tell me that you just wanna get up and go to work or go to school and just not do anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean, if it's just taking a walk in nature just because that makes you feel better, you know.  I think you can like, s- sorta make anything a hobby too like -- like I said, just taking a walk everyday --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, just -- it's better going at lunch, um, at a certain place you go a different place and eat something like [inaudible] you really gonna going to have to go, I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah, it's like -- yeah.
L:  I'm getting cat hair all over me.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, but it [MN] -- hold on a second, I'm sorry.  [PAUSE]  Hello?

R:  No, but, um --
L:  Like, you okay over there? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah.  Um, well, but, I like this program because like, it's the first time that I've -- I've really like, had a chance to do it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's good because, you know, you get to meet the person even though like, we don't know each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We get to know what other people think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it's real good.
L:  'Cause this -- this -- this is my second call.  I [MN], uh, talked to a lady from Texas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she was really nice.  She was really nice.  She reminded me of her -- my grandmother because of her voice and, you know, like, the way she talked and used her words.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Get away!  I don't know why [LAUGH] this cat is over here!
R:  [LAUGH] He likes the phone!  Oh God.  No, well, it -- it's real good.
L:  Yeah.  I wanna come up in Miami, that's one of the places I want to go to, Los Angeles.
R:  You should, you should, it's very nice.  Like, the beaches and, um, everything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, everybody just thinks on like, Disneyland and stuff like that but it has a lot more things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, me and my son went to Disneyworld, uh, no, Disneyland is over here, right?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Disneyland is over here?
R:  I can't hear you.
L:  As opposed to Disneyworld, 'cause that's in Orlando.
R:  Yeah, that's Orlando.  Miami's more like, the beach and the restaurants, but it has a lotta other things like [inaudible], which is like a park --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like, by the beach and it's very nice.
L:  Oh okay.

R:  [MN]
L:  -- and it's like a row of shops and a lot of 'em are like, c- consignment thrift store shops.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just really love those types of places.  Yeah --
R:  No, you'll find great stores.
L:  See, the cat is about to hang the phone up now.
R:  Okay.  [PAUSE]
L:  That's the only chance you're gonna get, 'cause I'm getting up when I get off the phone. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh gosh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um --
L:  Yeah.  How old are you?
R:  Um, twenty.
L:  You're twenty?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, I'm -- I'm thirty nine.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  And how old are your children?
L:  My daughter is twelve and my niece is nine -- I take care of my niece.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And my son is, uh, is twenty -- he's twenty now, he's getting ready to go into the air force.  He leaves the twenty seventh of this month.  So I might wanna cook him a dinner before he leaves.
R:  Oh, [several inaudible words].
L:  Cat is crazy.
R:  Well, [several inaudible words] my friend, um, her fiance has joined the marines.
L:  Oh okay, is he overseas?
R:  Yeah, and it's like real hard because they only come back for like, ten days.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hopefully he won't last that long.
R:  No, I don't think they will be 'cause anyway the, you know, the situation over there is over almost.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, it's not really over but it's more calm than before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So hopefully, you know, everything works out.  But I don't see a lot of support, like, down here in Miami --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of people hate them.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  I don't know why.
L:  They only doing their job.  You know.
R:  No, they are, I mean --
L:  I- if you gonna hate somebody, hate the president.
R:  Hm, yeah.  Not the people.  It's not their fault.
L:  You still --
R:  No, but there's a lotta people that are signing up, it's not really like -- that they force 'em.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh okay.
R:  But I -- you know, [several inaudible words].  Okay, let me stay on the subject. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry.  [several inaudible words].
L:  Well what else can we say about hobbies?
R:  I know, I mean, you could about a lotta things but then there's like, a time limit so you have to keep up with, um, you know, with the questions that they ask you.
L:  Trying to think what else can we say about hobbies.  Well, I've -- I think one -- one -- one actual thing I guess I could say about that is there
