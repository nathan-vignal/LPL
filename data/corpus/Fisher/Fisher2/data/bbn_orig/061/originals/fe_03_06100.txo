L:  Hello, my name is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Robyn.
R:  Hi, I'm Kate.
L:  Hi, Kate.  How are you?
R:  I'm good thank you.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine thanks. [NOISE] 
R:  Good.
L:  I live in the New York City area.  Where --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do you live?
R:  I live in LA.
L:  Oh, okay.  I --
R:  So, coast to coast. [LAUGH]
L:  -- used to live out there for a while, long time ago.
R:  Yeah, it's 
L:  Are you student?
R:  Yes, I am a student at USC.
L:  USC?  I used --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to go to UCLA.
R:  Oh, really?  Wow.
L:  Ooh, we're rivals. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Did you go to the game?  The big game.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, of course.
L:  [LAUGH] You guys --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- always win.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [SIGH] When --
R:  Well, yeah, this year we did. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] When I went there they used to carry signs, you guys, uh, that said, "Even if we lose we can still buy you".
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  We didn't mind.  It was fun.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Do you know I'm not even into sports, organized sports at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I took an ethnographic film class and I went and I shot it, you know, for my class.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, [NOISE] believe it or not it's a -- a -- sort of a cultural type of thing, that sort of event --
R:  Mhm.
L:  For our culture.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Anyway, [SIGH] um -- oh, what's your major?
R:  [SIGH] I'm Poli Sci.
L:  Okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Much more practical than film. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] So, uh, our topic of the day is --
R:  Is --
L:  -- how we keep up with current events.
R:  Current events, yeah.
L:  So, you first?
R:  Um, I'm a big CNN person. [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  Like, yeah, headline news and things like that.  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause in that way you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take it in while --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, doing something else as well [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you have to be careful about, you know, the information that you're taking in because sometimes it's not exactly [SIGH] objective or, um, completely reality sometimes.
L:  Oh, it's never objective.
R:  When it's -- yeah, when it's TV it's -- it's very easily, um, manipulated, so --
L:  [SIGH] Well, even the news that we get in -- in the newspapers is manipulated.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  I mean, we've been aware of that really publicly, um, since -- only since, y- you know, actually -- and I learned this in a film class too that the -- the first real huge political media event of our times was JFK's assassination.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm old enough to remember it [SIGH] and we were innocent before then.  Um, the media fed us what they wanted to feed us and really they cleaned a lot of information up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, all his affairs and all of that sort of thing.  Um, if they knew about it, and I'm sure they did, [NOISE] they kept quiet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was sort of, you know, a -- an implicit agreement.  They kept [SIGH], um, Presidents' images untarnished.  But then also remember the times back then.  
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] Um, men were expected to have affairs and women were expected to be quiet about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Culturally it was so different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um -- but I [NOISE] [SIGH] -- I do read newspapers [SIGH], um, not every day.  So, uh, what I rely on is -- I do watch CNN sometimes --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but I watch the noca- local news a lot because here in the New York City area there's lot of local news. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] And, uh, you know, I mean, um, after what happened -- nine eleven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you really have to keep abreast of what's going on.  I mean, the last -- it's not even two years since then. [SIGH] Um, it's a safety thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, i- I'm sure you've heard about   We've had, uh, National Guardsmen and, uh, other forces stationed in our subway stations.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I have to keep aware of that sort of thing every day.  You know, if you have any common sense.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And I did -- I was watching as the buildings [SIGH] were hit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I actually had a direct view of it where I was working [SIGH] and fortunately I turned away both times and didn't see the buildings actually physically drop, although I did see [SIGH] the second time on, uh, [SIGH] on -- on live television in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a screening room.  It w- -- I was in a corporate conference center in midtown that had a full open view of the events right then.  So, after that local news became more of a priority.  I kind of, uh -- I spent less time watching CNN.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Well, local news out here is very entertainment driven so it's not -- it's -- I -- I don't think it would help me that much with current events.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Like it's very flashy and very --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] very LA, you could say. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we have a few of those l- local stations too and of course local news, in terms of television is [SIGH] -- is usually, uh, [LIPSMACK] it used to be lower budget --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it used to be, you know, much simpler and then it got flashy.  Um, I understand that People Magazine influenced a- me- -- the media heavily and then USA Today became the People Magazine of newspapers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that changed everything as well and that even affected, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, television news.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, then everything became [SIGH], uh, flashier and more slick and, uh, but we have a very special station here.  A local station called New York One and that's all news and it's very interesting.  It's, uh, it's lower budget. [LAUGH] They -- they have everything, uh, set up so the reporters do everything.  They do their own --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- writing.  They do their own editing and I've seen them.  They go out there in the field.  They do the setup shots, um, with crew members and then they leave, even petite gals alone with the camera on her shoulder doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- other shots and interviewing people and it's -- it's unique.  It's, uh, it's direct news.  It's very cut and dried news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, a lot of people here watch that a lot.  It's -- it's not like anything else and I like that it's -- it's very factual and, uh, it's not glitzy at all.  It --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doesn't sound it, does it?
R:  No, no, not at all. 
L:  No it's [SIGH] -- it's, uh, it's really unique. [LIPSMACK] So, I -- I actually watch that a lot because you can get a lot of, uh, what you need for the day; local subway information, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, road information if you're driving, or weather.  I always watch it, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just before I leave to find out what the weather is and, um   But that's unique.  There isn't anything like that I don't think in most markets.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  A cable station that has that kind of viewership.
R:  No.  Definitely not here.
L:  No.
R:  So 
L:  So, let's see. [LAUGH] And the newspapers?  Do you have a favorite?
R:  Um, [SIGH] Well, [SIGH] I just -- you know, I will either read the LA Times or, um, what else do we get at my house?  Probably just on Sundays [SIGH] when I have time, um --
L:  That's a respected paper.  I remember that when I lived out there.
R:  Um, and I [SIGH]   But, um, I always go straight for the comics, so  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I don't read the comics any more.  I wonder what that means. [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.
L:  Whether I don't ha- -- you know, look to have fun.  When I was a kid I did.  Um, I also subscribe to Newsweek.  I have for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so many years it's ridiculous.  I love le- Newsweek.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I get a lot of -- more perspective, you know, from that.  They tend to, uh, have a slant[?], a point of view, a broader look because it's a weekly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] And it's -- it's such a good magazine.  And I also subscribe to New York magazine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just because it's got so much information about, you know, w- what's in the museums and of course movie listings and stuff like that and [SIGH], um, it's also a very interesting magazine.  It's a little -- it's a little slick and a little, you know, a little bit of fluff and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I'm sure you know it.  It's too -- it's too, uh, [LIPSMACK] it's too directed towards the rich or the, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nouveau riche with ridiculous amounts of money to spend on clothing.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, and that's kind of annoying.  You know, they'll make recommendations or have, uh, fashion pages and there'll be items that most of us could never afford.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, that's a little ludicrous and it seems more so now that, you know, with the unemployment rate is around here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's huge.  It's much higher than the rest of the country.  It's over nine percent.
R:  Mm.
L:  New York City, um, has not recovered.  In fact the -- the second year after it's worse than it was before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's funny, you would -- you would think that it would be an immediate affect [NOISE] but --
R:  Yeah, that would make it --
L:  Yeah, but it's -- it's very strange.  Um, the second year, um, there were more lay offs and it got harder and the rest of the country is actually in -- in a much better   I saw the statistics.  Like the rest of the country was really low.  It was -- like in some places three percent [SIGH] growth of their local economy and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And here things have really, really decreased. [LIPSMACK] But what can you do? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm sure you've heard the national -- in the national news about our [SIGH] budget problems here?
R:  N- --
L:  No? [LAUGH] 
R:  Briefly.  Like brief- briefly.  But yeah, it's been a busy weekend --
L:  Oh, boy.  No --
R:  -- so I haven't. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we -- I -- I'm surprised.  I guess they don't pay much attention. [SIGH] Yeah, New York City is in a real bind.  New York State isn't doing so well either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK]
