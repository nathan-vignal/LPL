L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  Hello, how are you doing?
R:  I'm good and you?
L:  I'm fine, thank you.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, my name is Barbara.
L:  [NOISE]  My name is Bola[?].  [SIGH] 
R:  Bola?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, and where are you?  Where do you live?
L:  Ah, in Washington DC.
R:  O- okay.
L:  Yeah, and you?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, I'm in L- Lavern, California, which is, um, [SIGH] about twenty minutes away from Pasadena.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Everybody knows where that is from the rose parade.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a easy place to ... use as a point of reference.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, [SIGH] so how do you get your news?
L:  Um, I watch TV a lot.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But, um, -- I'm -- I also get my news from the Internet.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  I don't do a lot of reading.  I mean, when I say, reading I mean read the newspaper.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  I don't -- I don't.  But like I said I get my news from the TV, [SIGH] from the radio, you know, while driving [NOISE]--
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and on the Internet.  [SIGH]  I love to +surf the new sites on the Internet.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  I didn't think Internet was mentioned.
L:  [MN]  It --
R:  Was it?
L:  It wasn't?  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I think that ... if it wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mentioned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they missed it --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- because I mean it's ... a way that a lot of people get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of news now.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I think it said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] newspapers, TVs, radio?
L:  Radio.  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  Is that -- did you -- do you recall any others?
L:  No.  No.  [NOISE]  No, I don't.
R:  And so I thought, mm, my first thing was --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that they missed the Internet.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  So, ...
L:  -- that is very important nowadays.
R:  Oh, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It really is.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's like with cell phones I think, um --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] my kids probably [SIGH] won't have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a land line in their house, --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, they'll probably just have cell phones when t- they have their home.  [SIGH]
L:  Hm.  Hm.  Hm.  [SIGH]
R:  So, ... um, I read the paper.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  Um, ah, just ... p- partially because I think it's a habit.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh!
R:  And, um, I grew up reading the paper and that was, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- part of, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, what I did --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and my family did.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] then I always try to catch the news, um, [SIGH] like in the middle of the afternoon if I have a half an hour.
L:  Oh!
R:  I'll catch -- you know, I'll --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- check the news.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then, um, at night before I go to bed I try to ... catch it again.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE]  And, um, I don't usually listen to the news in the car.
L:  Hm.  [NOISE]
R:  But, I know a lot of people do.
L:  Yeah.  I do.  When I'm going in the morning.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I just turn the radio on because I don't have time in -- you know, to watch TV [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- or read the papers in the morning, so [LIPSMACK] once I get in my car [NOISE] [SIGH] I just turn the radio on and [SIGH] I listen to it while I drive [NOISE] you know?
R:  To the news?  [NOISE]  [MN]  And so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what do you think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you think it's accurate?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you think ... what do you think about it?  Do you think it's very accurate?
L:  The news?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh!  I don't really know.  I just like [SIGH] try to you know, mm, [NOISE] [SIGH] I don't know.  I don't know what to say.  Some are, some aren't --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But I'm just used to, you know, [NOISE] hearing what they have to say and, [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- taking things the way I see them --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- because I'm -- nowadays a co- -- I can't, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tell which is accurate and which is not.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Bu- -- because a lot of TV stations [NOISE] and other radio stations have different views about different stuff.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, +especially on the war on Iraq.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [SIGH] they claim the government, you know, ah, -- is not telling us everything.  [SIGH]  And, um, some radio, you know, say some +journalists don't cover stuff fully.  Like one time they said [SIGH] when the war was going on they really [NOISE] covered everything.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But after the +war and, you know, they started --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- rebuilding Iraq, [SIGH] we didn't get to see a lot on TV any more.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um, [NOISE] I just like -- sh -- nowadays I just listen to the, you know, local news.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, like current events [NOISE] happening in schools [NOISE] or happening in my area.  [SIGH]  What the Mayor of the city's up to, you know, what the school system, you know, what is happening in the school system, [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stuff like that.  And I just try to cope with, you know, [SIGH] because I just want to close my mind to bad news now.
R:  Mm.
L:  I concentrate on, you know, the news -- the --
R:  It seems like there's --
L:  -- local news.
R:  -- very little good news.
L:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  It's all bad news.
L:  [NOISE]  Exactly, and I work for the government so it's like [SIGH] -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I heard bad news like that, especially what happened over this weekend [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in +Saudi Arabia, [SIGH] it stresses me +out because --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm like -- I'm in a government building [NOISE] most of my ... time.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  What if anything happens here?  So, [SIGH] I've --you know, stopped listening to all this [SIGH] crazy news and, ah, just listen to my local news, you know, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- know what is, you know, happening locally here.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Do you understand?  So, and if I -- and if it happens that while I'm listening to my local news [SIGH] all --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- this news about this bad stuff comes on, [NOISE] [SIGH] I just close my mind to it because I've told myself that I'm -- I -- I refuse to get stressed [SIGH] over +all those things because --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they really affected my life, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know.  A- affected how, you know, I took my [NOISE] kids out to enjoy themselves [SIGH] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because it's like you don't know what is going to happen [NOISE] wherever I go to.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  You don't know what is going to happen if you are in the metro or you are in the mall, and stuff like that.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  So, I've just to -- I've made up my mind to close my [MN] mind on this and enjoy my life.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, e- especially --
L:  You know, and take each day as it comes, [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and, um, leave the rest to God.  [SIGH]
R:  That's a good [NOISE] attitude.
L:  Yes.  I can't let all these +things hold me down --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stop me living, [SIGH] you know.
R:  I know.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I think sometimes, um, for me [SIGH] by the time you read something in the paper --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you already have further information f- from television, or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from the radio.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And so, I -- as sad as that is [SIGH] I like the paper because I like the whole concept of the paper [MN] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, um, I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that sometimes t- the information might be a little outdated until you get it.  [SIGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  I mean it used to be, [SIGH] you know, first thing in the morning y- you'd --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- get the new news.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I mean there would be the brand new news of the day.
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, [SIGH] um, [NOISE] [COUGH] I mean by the time you read it in the morning you know, you've had three updates [NOISE] already on line [SIGH] or on the radio.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, um, that's kind of sad.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know, you're i- information is more updated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] by the time you've, ah, reading about it.
L:  Hm.
R:  But [NOISE] I think ... for me local news is very critical.
L:  Hm.
R:  And it's important and I -- when you mentioned that I thought, "I love the local news".
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I want to know what's happening --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, around here.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, I mean something fun might happen or something, you know, you want to get involved in or something that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good news or [SIGH] you know, something maybe you can do about it in your community.
L:  Hm.
R:  And be involved in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, if y- y- you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know, y- you're only on ... CNN [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- then you don't know any n- -- local.
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  So, ... do you have a good local channel?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, that helps.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We do --
R:  That helps a lot.
L:  -- we do.  We do.  [SIGH]  We have the ABC, [SIGH] um, Channel Seven news, WGLA [SIGH] you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we have that and [NOISE] we have the Fox News and, um, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and ninety five point five on the radio, I like that, you know, Donny Simpson's[?], um, station [NOISE] [SIGH] you know?  [SIGH]  So, ... I like, um, [NOISE] all that, and, um, ... [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I have a friend whose mom lives in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Washington DC.
L:  Oh!
R:  And so, um, [MN] she, um, [MN] goes to visit once in a while --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and so [MN] I should ask her.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  "Okay, Melanie, what's your favorite?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Wh- when you're home what's your local news --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- that you listen to?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She would probably tell me what you said.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Ah, y- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, really, um, [MN] my ... my [NOISE] [SIGH] my listening to the news --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- as quick as the crystal[?] [SIGH] is quickly the crystal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because like I said I've limited myself to just local news.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:    So, the reason I used to listen to the news [SIGH] has, you know, greatly, greatly decreased.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just want to avoid all -- anything that's going to get me stressed up or, you know, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- get me -- start, you know, start getting me, afraid of, um, [SIGH] thoughts that might or might not happen [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, so ... [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  Well, we have some very good, um, Christian radio stations in our area.
L:  [SIGH]  That is good.  [SIGH]  That is good.  [NOISE]
R:  And I really find myself listening to those --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a lot more [SIGH]--
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when I'm in the car.  [SIGH]
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, you know, and they'll give you a little news update --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it isn't, um, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nearly as thorough --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- mm, you know, o- one of the news only --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- stations.
L:  Hm.
R:  [SIGH]  But for me [SIGH] I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- e- enjoy that car time to be [SIGH] e- encouraging --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- r- rather than informational I guess.
L:  Hm.  Yeah, --
R:  But --
L:  -- you're really right.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] there is other times that, you know, you feel like you're g- gathering information.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, ... [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  But with the Internet, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] I think y- you're right, you've got so much that's --
L:  Yeah, you have --
R:  -- accessible.
L:  -- too much on the [LAUGH] Internet.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [LAUGH]  You know stuff that doesn't get announced on your, +um, TVs or your radios you see on the Internet.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, then that way you -- you can have it in just a few minutes and you don't have to take --
