L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  This is Dawn.
R:  Hi, Dawn.  This is Gwen.
L:  Hi, Gwen.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from California, Los Angeles.  How about you?
L:  I'm in -- I'm in Minnesota. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, the [MN] -- I -- I did this one before and I spoke to someone in Arizona. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.  So --
R:  H- have you done this --
L:  Where do -- where do you get most of your current events from?
R:  Kind of a hodgepodge.  Um, I don't get it from TV as much as I used to just because I'm not home as often --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- as often as I used to be.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Um, so it's kind of like a -- a mixture of the internet and, uh, the radio.
L:  Okay.  Most --
R:  I do -- I do a lot of driving.  So 
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Well, I get most of it I'd say from the TV only because I tend to have it -- I -- I'm home now so I tend to have it on -- on and off during the day and I'd say --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the second place I get it from is probably the internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, just because it's so accessible.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  And when I'm at home my daughter usually has a Winnie The Pooh video on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] -- so I don't get --
L:  You don't get much current events from that, no? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  I -- I did see a Tigger across the screen this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- morning that said, "Arie Fleischer said he's gonna resign but that's -- that's -- that's the most recent thing I've seen on TV [LAUGH] --"
L:  Well , I tend to --
R:  -- as far as news.
L:  I tend to watch the TV but then I realize sometimes that, geez I haven't been watching the TV and then I haven't been on the computer or anything and then you feel like you've been left out for like three, four days.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then -- then you're like, "You know, we should watch the world news just to see if everything's still there". [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah, or I get it from my husband.  See he'll sit there and he'll tell me but then half the time he doesn't tell me things 'cause he thinks I heard it somewhere else so he doesn't even mention it.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's good.
R:  And I'll -- I'll say, "Oh, did you -- did you hear about this?" And he goes, "Oh, yeah".  And I go --
L:  Well, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  "Thanks for telling me".
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  "Oh, I thought you already knew". [LAUGH]
L:  My -- I get some from my husband but he -- he tends to assume that I know too.  Like, you know, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like did you hear -- like we had Paul Wellstone, um, he was our senator; he died.  And I just don't turn on the TV or the radio or anything in the morning because I'm trying to get two boys ready for school and if I turn anything on then they don't get motivated.
R:  Right.
L:  So, he calls up and says, "Did you hear about Paul?"  And then we have a brother in law, Paul.  And I was like, "Why, what happened?"  And he was like, "He died in a plane crash".  I'm like --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  "What was Paul doing on an airplane?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's like -- he's like, "Well, he was travelling".  I'm like, "So what?  Paul doesn't travel.  He works from home".  He's like, "Who are you talking about?"  I'm --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, "Who are you talking about?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he just assumed that I had had the TV or radio or whatever on and I knew that he had passed away in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a airplane crash.  So -- so, um, although I get some information from my husband it's not always up to date and reliable. [LAUGH] It's like if I'm getting it from the Enquirer. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Now what -- what -- what do you usually watch?  Like the local news or the -- or like world news with whomever?
R:  Um, normally it would be local news.  Now when -- when the -- we were really heavy into the war we had CNN a lot -- on a lot.
L:  Yeah, so did we.
R:  So, I -- I -- I watched it then.  Um, but, yeah, other than that would just be the local news.
L:  Yeah.  I like -- 
R:  And -- and -- and the sad part --
L:  I tend to like Peter Jennings.
R:  Yeah, now he's -- he's pretty good.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's Prada I don't care for as much.  Um, but yeah, no, Peter Jennings I think he, out of the -- the network ones he's the one that would watch the most.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think ABC is the one we watch the most.
L:  Is it?  I'm trying to think.  I don't even remember.  We t- -- we tend to watch, um, NABC at one time and NBC at another time.  It's really kind of weird.  We like the different people.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  So 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, and then I'll watch every now and then in the morning 'cause the   I guess like, um, Good Morning America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can consider that.
L:  Mhm, oh, yeah, that's still.
R:  It -- it's kind of like a mixture.  It -- it's news and entertainment.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I do watch like The Today Show or Good Morning America or whatever every once in a while but not too much in the morning.  It's mostly like -- like around now. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I was cooking dinner and the -- I mean, although it's on I wasn't really watching it which is unfortunate --
R:  Kind of the --
L:  But --
R:  Right, right.
L:  That's just the way it goes.  So, you end up listening to the radio a lot?
R:  I end up listening to the radio a lot.  Not just I -- with me driving -- since I drive a lot.  So, I [inaudible] stuff from the radio and then, um, because I'm -- I do have to be on the computer a lot and do a lot of emails for work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I'll, you know, surf and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, read stuff there.
L:  How long is your commute?
R:  Um, well, I don't have a -- a commute per se.  Um, part of my job is driving around so I --
L:  Oh.
R:  Like I -- I travel from place to place.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so that's how I, um, am in the car so much.
L:  I see.  Well, I m- -- I mean, I'm -- I'm s- -- I'm a stay at home mom and so, um, although I hear some in the car not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's not [MN] -- and on any sort of regular basis.  And I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- seem to read the paper at all hardly.
R:  I -- I don't either.  We get it and that's mainly 'cause my husband wants it.
L:  Right.
R:  And he -- he reads the sports section and, you know, he'll look at the business section.
L:  But I don't -- I don't --
R:  And --
L:  -- necessarily sit down and read the paper hardly.
R:  No.  I -- I --
L:  Maybe once or twice a month and that's just if somebody said, "Did you see?"  And I'll say, "I have no clue what you're talking about".  And they're like, "Well, you should've read this section".  And then I'll go back and read it.  But other than that it's just -- it just doesn't seem to fit in sometimes.  Most of the time.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't have the time for the newspaper.  It's the -- that's why I think like   Well, the radio because I do it while I'm travelling.
L:  Right.
R:  And then the internet because it's -- it's more accessible.  It's a little more quick.  I can kind of like browse through what I want and what I don't want.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, TV which is -- which is sad.  Sometimes I'll get my information from the little snippets they do 'cause[?] --
L:  At the bottom.
R:  -- little commercials. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  And you'll be like, "Oh, good.  That's all I needed to know". [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't -- I   Just it's -- we watched a lot of the war coverage on like CNN or MSNBC and then it got to be too much and I -- I didn't even want to turn on the radio or look on the computer or read the paper because it was just so depressing.  You know, and when they start talking about everybody's families and, you know, everything it just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- got to be too much.  So, there was a -- quite a while that we just didn't even turn anything on. [LAUGH] 
R:  See I -- I kinda -- see my -- I kinda do the opposite where it's just like I sit there and I, you know, when something big is happening I always wanna know everything that's happening.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'll -- I'll keep it on as much as possible.  But then after a while my husband's like, "Okay, you know --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- there's nothing new.  It's the same thing that they've been saying".
L:  Step away from the TV. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  But we can have cereal again tonight.
R:  "My basketball game is on". [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, goodness.  Other than that I can't think of   Like what are other forms, did they say, of -- of --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- world news, of -- or w- -- of news?  I think --
R:  I think they basically they just said TV, radio, newspaper or internet.
L:  Okay.
R:  Or your like family member.
L:  Family members.  I don't get it.  I mean, if I talk to my friends I'm certainly not going to say, "Did you hear?" [LAUGH] Unless it's something like major.
R:  Right, right.
L:  It's -- I don't -- I don't -- I think women can find other things to talk about.
R:  Pretty much.  I mean, now the -- the only thing that I could add to that would be that my mom is back on the east coast so she's three hours ahead.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I remember getting a phone call at like six or seven in the morning --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on September eleventh --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- with her telling me, "I -- I -- I don't know if you know this but, you know, she was pretty sure we -- we didn't because we were asleep".
L:  'Cause -- 'cause she woke you up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] So, but I mean, that's -- that's how I found out about the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- attacks since my mom --
L:  Well, see I found out from my husband from the September eleventh 'cause he's like, he called up and he's like, "Are you watching the TV?"  And I'm like, "How long have we been married?  The --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- TV doesn't come on in the morning, honey".  He's like, "You need to turn it on".  I'm like, "I need to get two kids ready for school".  And I turned it on and I'm like, "What is going on?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's like, "We don't know.  There's like a commuter plane".  And at that time it was just like whatever and I had just turned it on before the second airplane hit the second tower --
R:  Argh.
L:  And that was like   It was weird because on the way -- you know, I had walked my children to school and, um, the crossing guards are usually the older -- older children of the school and it was all --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- teachers this time.  And that's when you kind of knew that something more was going on.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it was -- it was -- yeah, I heard it from my husband.  He was like, "Are you watching TV?  And I'm like, "No, nothing's on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- I'm trying to motivate two boys".  You know.
R:  How old are your boys?
L:  They're ten and seven.  They'll be --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  They'll be eleven and eight in June and July.
R:  Wow, so you got your hands full.
L:  Yeah, you know, I mean, they're fun, they're boys, but boy sometimes, you know, you can't turn the TV on for boys because they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They get that glazed kind of look.  They're mouth --
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  -- drops just a little bit and I'm pretty sure their breathing slows down.
R:  [LAUGH] Probably.  I --
L:  So --
R:  I've -- I've got a two year old and, um, lately her thing is everything has to be Pooh video.  If somebody else wants to watch another program --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's just not heard of in her world. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, go to the -- the other room then. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Pretty much that's what --
L:  'Cause you're not watching the news in here. [LAUGH]
R:  That's what my husband does. [LAUGH] We'll sit there and we'll put her video on in the living room --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then he gets relegated back to the bedr- --
