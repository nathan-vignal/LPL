L:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
R:  Yes, hello.  This is Theresa.
L:  Hi, Theresa.  This is Rosemary.  How are you today?
R:  Just fine.
L:  Um, I guess the curr- -- the -- it's current events.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And how we get --
R:  How you find 'em out.
L:  -- our information.  Yeah.
R:  I'm not much of a news watcher.  I guess my husband watches the news all the time and he tells me his theories on it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right.
R:  Sunday newspaper.  How about that?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, I'm not much of a newspaper myself person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I b- basically I guess I get it from the television and through people.
R:  Uh-huh, Uh-huh.  
L:  Um, I live in New York City so [MN], you know, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right now [LAUGH] the topic is, um, [LIPSMACK] that seems to be going around is the -- the increase in the fare, um, of the trains -- the subway.
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  I -- I don't know where you're from.  Are --
R:  Uh-huh.  No, I'm from way out in the country in Missouri. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But -- but I -- I thought you were maybe were from New York.  You have an accent, just a little.
L:  [MN] Well, you do too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] See I have that slow, co- country drawl. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] She's not from Queens. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um, yeah --
L:  But, um, you know, so --
R:  So, how much does it cost for the trains to go?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, it was a dollar fifty each way and now it's up to two dollars each way.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that -- you know, that's four dollars a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just to get to and from work.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, um, then they found out that the MTA had, um, this enormous amount of money that they were, um, hiding and --
R:  Oh.
L:  So, now they disclosed that they owed all this, you know, they have all this money in the budget -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, that was held illegally.  And -- so now the thing is they dropped it t- back to a dollar fifty.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  But it's not active just yet and --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- um, so now they're doing an appeal.  I mean, you know, it's just like --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- crazy.  It's like --
R:  So, even if you pay the two dollars each way to get the work and then next week it goes down you d- -- you still don't get any rebate for your two dollars.
L:  N- no.  No --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I paid seventy dollars for unlimited this month.  I have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unlimited metro card.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, I'm -- I'm unemployed for over a year.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, and you know that's not uncommon around here lately.
R:  Yeah, same --
L:  So --
R:  -- way here too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think that's everywhere.  Hm.
L:  So, I -- I -- I mean, I guess I would say I -- I mostly get it from the television but I just watch the news in the morning to find out, you know, if anything else blew up and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] what the weather is. [LAUGH] 
R:  The Today Show, or those kind of shows.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so I don't know if we're supposed to be talking about current events or how we get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- our information.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I think they were just interested how you did it.  I don't know. [NOISE] I'm like you.  I watch the Today Show and, you know, those --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kind of shows kind of in the morning.
L:  Yeah, that's channel four, right?
R:  They're on while the kids get ready for school. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Other than that I don't watch the news.  I -- it's -- I don't know. [LAUGH] I -- I find that if I watch the news I get -- you know how you get.  You get to feeling powerless and depressed about the whole thing and you're thinking, "It's best to just not read that too much or do that -- watch it too much".  
L:  Do you know, I feel the same way.  I'm powerless over it, um, o- over what's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- going on and it only frustrates me because there's just a negativity --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, sure, sure.
L:  -- that is   I mean, facts are facts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, you know, the- there's never a positive note.
R:  No, no.
L:  You know.
R:  And you think to yourself, "Well, gee, I didn't kill anybody today".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "The neighbors didn't kill anybody".
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you know, there's -- there's surely some people that aren't -- that aren't being that incredibly cruel.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Y- yeah.  It's, um -- although they're su- supposed to rely specifically on facts, they don't.  You know, through tone of voice and -- and, um --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  Y- you know, facial expressions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  Innuendo.  Kind of leaving --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the -- leaving the little question mark and -- yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.  So --
L:  And then it makes me wonder how much is censored and how much, you know --
R:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.  Because even when they say they're giving the news and they're just giving you the news; well, they're not.  They've, you know, sucked the news in and then they spit it back out. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they -- they evaluate it and change it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, in their perceptions.
L:  I mean, I still don't even know.  Is the war over? [LAUGH] You know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And all of a sudden we hear nothing.
R:  Yeah, no.  Huh-uh.
L:  You know, the troops are starting to come home.  Really?  "Where is this guy?"  "Oh, we don't know".  Hm.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, no.  It's weird, isn't it, how they do that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm not -- yeah.  And then I always -- like I said I get the paper --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- for -- on Sunday for coupons and so, uh, [SIGH] you read the paper and you think, "Oh, no". [LAUGH] And you keep finding, you know, and you keep thinking, "Well, [SIGH] I [SIGH] -- those people need to do coupons.  I could help those people". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Or do something, but you know, you just -- y- I think it's that sense of powerlessness that makes it worse.
L:  Right.
R:  And you fear everyone [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  because you're sure that, you know, everyone's out murdering, everyone's out doing something wrong.  So --
L:  You know what I find more that -- that, um, the -- the people that aren't from this country are so fearful and that makes me sad.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you see a woman who's obviously, um, s- -- you know, some sort of Middle Eastern person with -- rolling down the street with a kid and, you know, she's afraid and that makes me sad.  
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  That, you know, innocent people because of their heritage are afraid to be who they are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know not everybody is a terrorists -- terrorist.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, sure, sure.  See now I live out in the country and we don't -- you know, in a little teeny town of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maybe five hundred people we don't -- you know, we don't have anyone that even looks Arab.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, so, um, we don't have that kind of problem --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so much.  You know what I mean.  But I can imagine in a bigger city you would have that a lot.
L:  Yeah, it's pretty average.
R:  Yeah.  But everybody would be scared. [SIGH] But really to be perfectly frank, e- even though you know they probably didn't do anything you still always probably have just a little bit of fear in your mind thinking, "Oh, no, are they gonna -- what are they gonna blow up next?" [LAUGH] You know, I mean, there is a reason to be fearful --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- from the news and you -- so you really don't know which way to go.  I don't know.
L:  You know, I think what -- what made me more afraid [LAUGH] is -- remember wh- when they had the -- the white powder?  There was supposed to be, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, there was like white powder --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, be careful of white powder and stuff like that.  Any time I saw something like odd on the street that made me really afraid.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [MN]
L:  But I think because it's just so common to see Arab or, you know, Middle Eastern people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean, it was sad.  I mean, people owned businesses and they weren't opening their stores because they were afraid.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Because they were afraid.  Yeah.
L:  But then there was -- is an American -- uh, it was a blind place.  You know, blinds and shades?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And he had, um, the American flag in the window and somebody threw a rock; a huge rock through the -- the plate glass window.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  And that was like horrific.  So, then he started putting President Bush's face, you know, all up and --
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  You know, so it was like now we're gonna like have this dirty little war with whoever was doing it.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  Which is --
R:  And it's really crazy because he was probably there in business for a long time.  I mean, probably people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- knew him.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was American.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But because he had a flag up somebody who was from -- from the Middle East, obviously --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, you think that's what it was, yeah.
L:  -- threw a rock through the window.  Which I have a flag on my window.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I have a flag on my --
L:  You know.
R:  -- car.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, we all got those.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  Well, that's really strange, isn't it?  So, you --
L:  So --
R:  -- just don't know.  Yeah.  So, I think the news -- the news likes you to be fearful and that way you turn on the news and you watch it more.
L:  That's interesting.  I didn't even, you know --
R:  Sure.  I always think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what they do.  They go, "Oh, it's really bad.  Tune in".  And then you tune in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thinking, " [SIGH] I'd better tune in 'cause, you know, I -- they're -- you know, they're --"
L:  Find out how your commute's doing tomorrow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sadness.  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Even though we live out in the country where there's -- like I said in a little, teeny town [SIGH] as soon as my son heard the news --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- on the radio --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about the nine eleven, he called us from -- he's in the military -- and he --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- called us and told us to not go anywhere.  To not go out of the house.  To, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  He was fearful for us --
L:  Sure.
R:  And I think that's what they do is they kind of create a mass hysteria about things that --
L:  At that point it was probably warranted.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  At that point but not out in Missouri out in the country but still I don't know. [LIPSMACK] You never know.
L:  Yeah, I guess.  I mean, but he's in the military.  He would know better.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Would -- y- you know.  
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Is he still there?
R:  Yes, uh-huh.  So, uh --
L:  D- did he -- was he participating in the war?
R:  No, no.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Luckily he didn't -- he didn't have to do that.  He's in Okinawa and they only have to go if it's in, uh, Korea.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  They're in that section of the world.  But still, it's still real scary.
L:  Oh, yeah, sure.  Yeah, sure.
R:  So, like I said, and don't you think all those people watch the news with the war just thinking --
L:  Wh- [SIGH] --
R:  You might see a picture of someone you cared about and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you could see 'em?
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] I always wondered about that.  I don't know.
L:  Is that your bell or is this --
R:  No, it's mine.  I timed it for ten minutes.  I thought, "Well --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I didn't know.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ten minutes goes by fast if you're talking to someone that you can talk to.
L:  Right.  Right, right.
R:  But ten minutes is a long time if you have to kind of carry somebody.
L:  Um, yeah.  I -- this is the first time I've called.
R:  Oh, me too.  Uh, well, this is my second call but the first time I called in.  I thought, "Well, they didn't call me again.  I'll call in". [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I -- you know what happened yes- -- the other day I called and, um, it was -- I was on hold for forever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I hung up.
