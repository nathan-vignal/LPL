L:  Hi, this is Judy Mellor[?] from Florida.
R:  Hi, this is Leigh Tony from California.
L:  How you doing?
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Good. 
R:  So, I get my news from a combination.  I, ah, I get it from the news on television and I read the paper daily. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, when I'm in my car, I listen to the radio.
L:  Oh.  Very good.
R:  So, I kinda get it from every aspect. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I get --
R:  What about you?
L:  I'm pretty much a media absent person.  The way that I get my news is occasionally when I, um, hit on the Internet on a site that has a news blip that in- -- may interest me, then I might look at it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, otherwise as far as, like, really important things that come across on the news, like warnings of storms or, um -- I live in Florida so there's a lot of hurricanes, things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that, or I'm also involved in some, um, advocacy.  So I get -- my dad will warn me when that kind of stuff comes out in the newspaper or whatever and he'll call me and cut the clippings for me or whatever.
R:  Ah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- where are you in Florida?
L:  Right, ah, Tampa, Saint Pete area.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have a daughter, ah, who lives, ah, near Fort Lauderdale, in --
L:  Oh, do --
R:  -- Coral Springs.
L:  -- ya?  Yeah, she's down southeast, I guess.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  Yeah, on the East Coast.  Yeah, it's a beautiful place to live.  But I really --
R:  Do you think --
L:  -- am --
R:  -- so? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I like it.
R:  I like to visit, but it's so hot. 
L:  Oh, yeah.  I have, um, [LIPSMACK] actually never, um -- I don't watch the news and I don't promote my kids watching the news, because I --
R:  Oh, it's pretty gruesome --
L:  -- think a lot of people --
R:  -- these days, isn't it?
L:  It is gruesome and I think, um, it tends to affect how you approach life, I think, if you're --
R:  Sometimes.
L:  -- if you watch it too much.  Well, for me it does.  I know --
R:  Yes, I know --
L:  -- everybody is different.
R:  -- I agree with you, I agree with you.  I -- I think, um, first of all the redundancy is just, you know, just overwhelming redundance.  It's -- it's just like, um, repetition --
L:  I know.
R:  -- repetition, repetition, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, I think sometimes there's a lot more that I need to know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes --
R:  Um --
L:  -- exactly.  And I don't wanna hear that stuff, so I kinda --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- try to tune that out. 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I figure if there's any kind of real emergency, they always do a special broadcast or whatever, so I'll usually get that on the radio, or people call me 'cause they know that I'm not plugged in -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so to speak. 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, um, I -- I sk- skim the paper, you know, and then I kind of zoom in on anything that is really grabbing my interest or, ah, or something that I think will affect somebody I know or that kind of thing. 
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- I tend to look at things, um, in areas where my children are.  My children are kind of all over the place, so ...
L:  Right.  So you hit that national section probably.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I, you know, kind of toss away the sports page [LAUGH] if --
L:  Well, you know --
R:  -- whatever sports I wanna pick up, I catch on the -- on the news.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I don't pick up much sports at all.  I'm not too into that.  
R:  No.
L:  Um, I -- when I do -- when I was reading the newspaper, my favorite section was the perspectives --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I realised I get too excited about every issue that comes along the path, that it kind of gets you misdirected, you know, and I'm -- since I'm in social services, and I pick certain topics to advocate on, when I was reading the perspectives I was finding a whole lot of things that bothered me. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well --
L:  And --
R:  -- absolutely.  
L:  You know --
R:  And you can't fix everything.
L:  Exactly. 
R:  Yeah, I -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- agree.  It just -- it's -- what there-- what is wrong with our country is so overwhelming that you just don't even know where to start and -- and I think, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- most people are trying to start w- -- in their home, in their neighborhood, and their small groups --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hoping that that will spread, you know, because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's no way that you can deal with the -- the bigness of what's happening.  I mean, there's just so much wrong [LAUGH] that to just --
L:  I know.
R:  It's scary. 
L:  I know.
R:  It's scary.
L:  I had a call --
R:  I'm, um, I'm sixty three years old, so I was raised in the fifties and was the last generation of what I call the innocent generation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, before we came into the sixties, you know, with all the +protesting and --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- um --
L:  And I was raised in the sixties.  I was born in sixty. 
R:  Oh, so you were, yeah.  But you --
L:  No, I was kind -- 
R:  -- but you weren't really -- you weren't really around 'til the seventies, as far as -- as what was happening. 
L:  Well, really I was, because --
R:  See, I was born in nineteen thirty nine, so I was --
L:  Oh, you were?  Right. 
R:  Yeah, so I was born, I went through World War Two --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and went through that change, but, I mean, the fifties were, you know, were really kind of like Happy Days.  Everybody [LAUGH] was very simple. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  The world was simple.  It was, you know, right or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- wrong and ...
L:  Well, when I grew up, where I grew up, we were in D.C. and so --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- we were -- and my parents were --
R:  -- you were right in the heart of everything.
L:  Yeah, and they were government workers so they were always, you know, discussing the parties and issues.  I remember all the things that were going on, the protests and the segr- -- [inaudible] segregation and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Kennedy, you know, all the Kennedys who got shot. [LAUGH] I remember --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I -- I remember vividly seeing them on, I think it was in sixty three --
R:  Right.
L:  -- although I can never remember which Kennedy it was, the one that was shot and killed, Jo- --
R:  John --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the president.
L:  Yeah.  No, and then there was the one, the other --
R:  Then Bobby --
L:  -- one that was shot while --
R:  -- his brother Bobby was --
L:  -- he was giving a speech.
R:  -- killed when he was running for office, yeah.
L:  Right, he was giving a political speech or something and got --
R:  And there was --
L:  -- shot in the head.
R:  -- Martin Luther King, too.  It --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was in the middle of all of that.
L:  Yeah, and I -- when Martin Luther King happened -- happened, I was pretty much becoming pretty cognitive myself, you know, previous to that --
R:  But it's around you, you know --
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  -- it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like, I was in the middle of World War Two, even though I was still a little person, I -- I'm --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- very much aware, you know, I was much aware of what was happening.
L:  Yeah, and I think that the media has really, um, grown so much and it's so easily accessible, that the redundancy that you're talking about now is that yes, we hear much more a -- a variety in things and also so much of a redundancy over and over and over again.  And it kind of -- it's kinda like when you listen to a song on the radio, and you don't really like it necessarily, it doesn't strike --
R:  You think you're hearing --
L:  -- you as anything special --
R:  -- all the time. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then you hear it all the time --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and next thing you know, you're singing it and you like it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think that -- that -- that the repetition and the redundancy of the news, kind of, you know, can take you in another direction, the same sort of way it influences you.  Not you, but anybody --
R:  No --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- no, no, I think anybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, anybody, no, I agree.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree absolutely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't know --
L:  This is pretty interesting.
R:  -- it's like -- it's like somebody made a comment, ah, you know, that -- that when we were going through this last war, um, the -- the -- the television set was like the ultimate reality show.  I mean, we were watching the war going on, as it was going on.
L:  I know, incredible.
R:  And somebody made this comment, you know, it -- it's just the ultimate reality show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah, yeah, the media has definitely changed a lot, and of course --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- does affect everyth- -- you know, in the way everything is --
L:  You know, and it's really actually hard to stay away from, you know.
R:  Y- yes.
L:  I don't have TVs or cable in my house because, you know, there's a lot of good stuff on the TV too --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but you can't help but getting kinda sucked in, if you have it.  I can't help but getting sucked in if I have it even in the house.  And I don't want my kids to be sucked into it so much, they get enough at school.  Um, you know, because you -- there's CNN and so many other wonderful kind of -- you know, the Disney channel does a lot of science things and --
R:  Oh, yeah, there's good -- the Discovery --
L:  There's some really awesome -- 
R:  -- Channel too, the Discovery Channel's wonderful.
L:  Yeah, and, um, but I don't even have cable, because, you know, the only thing we watch are movies. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Ah --
L:  That we rent. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I see.  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a good way to control what you're watching.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, but, um, there's so much -- there is so much out there.  Have you been, um, signed up to do these calls very long?
R:  No.  
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  I think this is the fi- -- this is the first one I have participated in.  
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- no, this is my third.  I kinda like it.  It's, like, um, gets --
R:  Touching base --
L:  -- you thinking.
R:  -- with different ideas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, they had one that -- where they -- we talked about school issues and another one if you were going to start your own business.  So they have some pretty interesting --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- topics.  And I've done three in a week so ...
R:  Well, I wasn't -- I -- I -- I signed up a couple months ago, but then I was gone, I was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- travelling, so if it came in, I wasn't here.
L:  Right.
R:  So, but this is the --
L:  So, are you retired?
R:  No, no --
L:  You work?
R:  -- I'm an actor.  I'm an actor and a director. 
L:  Oh, neat. 
R:  Yeah, so I'm probably won't --
L:  So, where are you --
R:  -- retire 'til I --
L:  -- based in California?  Are you in the thick of all of that area that they do the --
R:  No, I'm in northern California.
L:  Okay. 
R:  Right outside of San Francisco.
L:  Oh.
R:  But there's +a enormous amount of live theatre here, which is what I mostly do.  I -- I do do --
L:  Oh, how wonderful.
R:  -- you know, do do commercials and I do do voice over work, but the majority of my work is, um, is live theatre.
L:  Oh, how wonderful.
R:  So, [LAUGH] um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- in -- in -- in the business I'm in, you really kind of have to stay on top of what's happening, because so much of what is going on --
L:  Is reflected in your --
R:  -- is reflective of what's going on -- exactly. 
L:  Right.
R:  So [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  Yeah, so you're kinda tied into that.  And people in my field tell me, since I'm in social services, they tell me, you know, you really need to be more aware.
