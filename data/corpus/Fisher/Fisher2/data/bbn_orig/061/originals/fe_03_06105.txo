L:  Hi --
R:  Yeah[?] --
L:  I'm Sasha.
R:  Hi, Sasha.  My name is Grace.
L:  Hi Grace.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about how we get most of our information.
R:  Mhm.  I noticed that one of the choices is not, uh, the internet.
L:  I know, which I thought was interesting.
R:  Isn't that kind of odd? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, because that's actually how I get most of my information.
R:  [LAUGH] Same thing for me. [LAUGH] I mean, I read the paper daily. [SIGH] Uh, I don't r- -- I don't watch the news very often though.  I mean, just kind of, you know, bits and pieces.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But, uh, I notice that was interesting that that was not shown as one of the, um, the choices.  I was -- I wonder if that was just an omi- omission on their part because I can't believe that they wouldn't, uh, think of that as a valid [LIPSMACK], uh, source of news.
L:  I think they probably just did forget to put it in there because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Most -- mostly that's how I get my news.  I don't really care for watching the news on television simply because I just don't watch a whole lot of television and [SIGH] what I don't get from the internet I get from the radio.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um --
R:  And I think the problems with, uh, [SIGH] either reading the paper or -- or particularly with the news, you have no control over what sequence the [LIPSMACK] current events are in.
L:  And no --
R:  I mean, you'll turn it on and they'll be talking about the war for a while, for example, [SIGH] and if you are interested in finding out information on a specific topic, you have no control over it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Which is what I like about the internet because --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- not only do you have control over what you read and when you read it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but how much time you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get to spend on it because --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- it -- with the news on television they just kind of go through it, [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] just like that [NOISE] and they don't really -- they don't really give you --
R:  It's not as -- it's not in depth.
L:  Yeah, it's not very in depth at all so you --
R:  It's not.
L:  -- don't really get all the details and find out everything that's going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then most of the time on the news they rep- -- they repeat the same thing over and over and over.
R:  Exactly. [MN] So, I don't, um --
L:  It is very annoying.
R:  I get the paper every morning and I -- I'll -- I'll read it but I don't read it from front to back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I open it up and then I look for something of interest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, something such as, you know, like that Scott Peterson case.  I find that very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, but then I'll -- I'll skip over for example some of the war coverage because I've been inundated with it.
L:  Yeah, like enough is enough.
R:  So, I mean there's a limit to how much I wanna read without being saturated.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's pretty much what I do with the newspaper too.  I just kind of flip through and find what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- interests me and then I go from there.
R:  And the rest goes into the recycling or into the hamster cage. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, usually recycling. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's funny.
L:  Usually recycling. 
R:  Oh. 
L:  It's b- -- it's almost like it's a waste of paper sometimes when you think about it because sometimes there's just nothing in there to read.  There's nothing that you don't already know.  There's nothing that you haven't already seen on the internet or heard on the radio. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  There's just no fresh news.  Whereas with the internet you can go anywhere you want to whatever city you want.  You wanna find out what's going on in Philadelphia, you look for the Philadelphia newspaper and you read it online.  You don't have to sign --
R:  To subscribe, exactly.
L:  -- up for it.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And have it delivered or anything like that.  So [SIGH] --
R:  What's funny about that I notice too the -- the information that's on the internet is more up to date.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.  Yes.
R:  Because you -- you'll hear about a celebrity dying and you will, um, [LIPSMACK] you kn- -- sometimes the next morning I'll open up my paper and there isn't anything there.
L:  Yeah, and you see it like --
R:  And, uh --
L:  -- two days later.
R:  Yes, and then I've already read it last night like about, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, June Carter Cash dying last week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Johnny Cash's wife.  I didn't see anything in the paper the next day but then it was in the following day's paper.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  So, it's like a day and a half. [LAUGH]
L:  I think someti- --
R:  So, how timely is that?  You know?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I think sometimes that's actually where most -- most newscasters get their stuff is from the internet because the --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- people that are actually on the street, the first thing they do is sit down at the computer and start typing out whatever's going on, whatever they see.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's what I do.  I don't -- I don't waste time trying to figure out, "Well, who should I tell this?  And how should I" -- I just go straight to the computer and look for what I want.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's the same way with trying to find anything -- like if you're trying to travel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you're trying to find a great -- a great deal or a good place to go, or you wanna find out about wherever you chose to go.  The best way to find out about it is on the internet.  Then you can find out whether or not -- what the crime is like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  What the people are like, what the atmosphere is like.  That's stuff that you just can't get from a travel agency or from watching the news or anything like that.  It -- which I think is a huge, huge loss --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you can't really get the kind of information that you're looking for.
R:  Well, I agree because since the internet has been so common I have not used a travel agent for a couple of years I would say. 
L:  You know what?  I haven't either.
R:  Um, whereas before I always did, you know? [LAUGH] I used to always do that and now I don't at all [LIPSMACK] and I also very rarely will call the airline directly.  I usually will just, you know, do several search engines and find a good fare --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and proceed from there and including booking it online.  I hardly ever even call the airline --
L:  You know what?  I hardly ever do that t- --
R:  Whereas before I did all that.
L:  I hardly ever do that either.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you'll find the best deals on the internet before --
R:  You will.
L:  -- you can find it anywhere else.
R:  You will.
L:  'Cause I mean even though they advertise on television, by the time they've gotten to the point where they've filmed the commercial and done all that stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we've already read about it, booked the ticket and on our way to go do whatever.
R:  We're one step ahead of them. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And sometimes --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- two or three. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm a couple of blocks ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, do you also read like news magazines like Newsweek and Time?
L:  Um, I read Time every once in a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The news magazines that I read I have a tendency to, um, go towards the more political oriented news magazines.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  And so those are the ones that I primarily spend time reading.  I don't really pay a whole lot of time to Newsweek --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at all.  But --
R:  I don't any more either.  I used to read that and US News and World Report [SIGH] and I don't buy 'em any more.
L:  Yeah, y- -- I used to read --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- US News and World Report too but I think the only thing that I even -- well, it's not even a magazine it's just the New York Times.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That's about the --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, that's a good newspaper.
L:  -- only paper I can say.  Yeah.  That's about the only paper I can say that I read, not even daily but more often than I read anything else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  It's interesting.  I think the whole thing has -- the -- the whole, uh, situation of how people get their news has been really radically changed.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Don't you agree?
L:  Especially with the internet.  Especially with the [inaudible].
R:  And that's what's funny that that's not a choice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Somebody made a mistake, I think. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Somebody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- made a big mistake because --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  The internet is pretty much surpassing everything.  I mean, even AJC is pimp[?] and AJC dot com.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, they hardly ever -- more often than not you don't see them trying to get subscribers for the paper to have the paper delivered any more.
R:  Exactly.
L:  They want everybody to go online whether it's to look a- -- look for a car or check out the news or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever is happening and the paper they're sending people to the website.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So --
R:  That's true.  They are.  You're right.
L:  Why would you not have the internet [LAUGH] as a choice?
R:  That's strange.  I think it was just an --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- oversight. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  But, uh, I like, um --
L:  -- a big[?] oversight.
R:  Well, the internet's better too because you can -- you can filter through whatever you don't need.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Like I said with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a pap- -- with the new -- watching the news -- I was trying to watch the news last night and everything that they were covering were topics that I don't find particularly interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the stuff I want to see [LAUGH] --
L:  Is not on there.
R:  They made [LAUGH] -- they made a couple of blurbs about the Scott Peterson case and --
L:  I know and no details, nothing.
R:  I wanted to see more but it was -- it was at the end.  I know it was at the end because, uh, the part that I watched they never did show what they were looking for in the water so it was like, "Well, thank you.  That's the part I wanna find out".  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's the interesting part of the whole thing.
R:  It is.  
L:  It's funny news -- news when it comes to like television news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is really, really bias.  Like I probably --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- sh- -- I shouldn't -- I probably shouldn't say this 'cause I work --
R:  No, it's true.
L:  -- for CNN but they have got -- CNN puts the most bizarre spin on things sometimes.
R:  They do.
L:  I mean, it's supposed to be, you know, objective and good clean --
R:  But it's not.
L:  -- reporting but it's really not.  I think the only place you can even find objective type news any more is on NPR or some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- radio station -- British radio station that they really don't have an interest one way or the other --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- in what's going on except for common interest of well, "Let's see what happens now".  Not they have anything staked in it or --
R:  Well, it's true because I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  When I watch the news I want it impartial.  Um, [MN] an impartial view of what's going on.  I don't want the -- the station's viewpoint and I don't want the newscaster's viewpoint.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  To me that's not really why I'm watching it.  I kind of wa- -- unless I'm watching a commentary. 
L:  Well, yeah, that's di- --
R:  I wanna know what's happening.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  You know, I don't really wanna hear what they think about it.  That's not why I'm watching it.  I wanna find out what's going on.  Now, if I wanna watch -- find out what they think about it then I would watch [SIGH], uh, like I said a news commentary where they're actually debating or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- discussing points.
L:  Yeah.  I think it's interesting too that sometimes it's -- well, most of the times it's just kind of one sided.  Like you hear one side of what's going on.  Like with the war.  It --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- was just what was going on with the war from our perspective.  You know, so --
R:  Yeah, but we don't know everyone else's perspect- [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.  And there's so -- there's more than --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- just one perspective.  There's always more than one side to any issue.
R:  Oh, of course.
L:  But if you only get one side how are you supposed to really be able to make any kind of informed decision about anything if all you're hearing is just a piece of the information?  It's like looking for -- looking -- trying to drive somewhere with only half the map.
R:  Exactly.  You need the whole picture. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  Just don't [inaudible] any more.
R:  You don't wanna print out part of the map because, uh, you need to find out what area you're going to, not just the street that you're turning on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You need to find out the entire section of town.
L:  See what everything looks like.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  I think that's one of the biggest reasons why I don't watch television for news.  Because --
R:  Well, I agree.
L:  -- you never get everything.  You get whatever they feel like giving you.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How ever much of it they feel like giving you and that's it.  That's the end of it.
R:  And I think they -- they -- they
