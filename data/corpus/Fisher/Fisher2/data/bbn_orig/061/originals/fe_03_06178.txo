R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hi.  [SIGH] 
R:  Hey.  What's your name?
L:  I'm Sarah.
R:  Sarah, I'm Nora.
L:  Hi.
R:  Nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH] Where -- where do you live?
L:  Milwaukee.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in Olympia, Washington.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, far, far away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  Yeah, I've done two different ones before.
R:  Yeah, me too, this is my --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- third.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it's weird, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Pretty strange.
R:  Uh-huh.  But interesting.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.  Good thing to tell your friends.  So how do you get your, um, current events?
L:  Um, mostly I listen to NPR on the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- radio.
R:  Mm.
L:  But --
R:  It's funny, like, everyone who I've talked to so far --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in this study, is like, um, [MN] uh, somewhat sort of lefty.  In -- I mean, including myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, maybe it's --
L:  Well, oh, I talked to a woman in Texas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and sh- uh, she and I didn't really agree about too much --
R:  Oh really?
L:  I think.
R:  What was the to- --
L:  We were talking about the Middle East.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And she struck me as being -- I don't know if it was just the Texas accent --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] that -- that biased me to assume, but she was pretty, "We gotta go in there and we gotta do this and we gotta do this".
R:  Oh man.
L:  And, "We gotta support the president and --" [LAUGH].
R:  Well.  Yeah, like, um, like, I had a conversation, uh, with a woman -- I think she was in California -- about the war and she was totally against it too. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was like, wow, just because like, opinion polls are so [NOISE] -- just make it seem like everyone supports the war, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So it's nice when --
L:  And nobody I know does.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  So I don't really --
R:  -- no one I know does either, right.  So, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's nice to have a random stranger also not, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH] It's pretty cool.  Um, I don't [MN] -- like, NPR is on around the house but it's not like, I don't listen to it, um, religiously but I probably get most of my current events from, um, my partner checks, um, The New York Times and The Guardian on the Internet every day.
L:  Yes.
R:  And so usually I get news from there, probably.
L:  Okay, yeah.  And I would say that I -- probably it's NPR and then I watch The Daily Show --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- more than I watch any real news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that the one with John Stewart?
L:  Right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that just is my totally biased left wing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- amusing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- spin on things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But -- and I have to say, lately I think I've just been burned out on paying too much attention to what's going on.
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  So it's much more bang, going in one ear, out the other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Than I sometimes am.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which -- and I know this is not a good time --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to not be paying attention --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- to what's happening in the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Yeah, but I think it can like, not necessarily be constructive to -- you know, like, I think there's such an emphasis on like, you have to always been informed and have all this information but like, it takes a lot of time to stay on top of every little thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that maybe you could be putting towards like, actually making positive change or like, l- l- living a happy life yourself or whatever.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, and getting --
R:  Have to balance.
L:  And there's so much news that's not -- I mean, it's good to know, okay, there have been all these bombings this week in the Middle East.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's good to know that, but you don't need to know whatever celebrity is being arrested for murder and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, all those little --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- daily -- every little tiny thing that --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- happens, that -- I mean, I don't think I need to be plugged into the news twenty four seven.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's true.  And like, um, yeah, there's -- and so much like, of m- mainstream media in particular is just so vacuous, like -- like, just reporting on really irrelevant things that really, I -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what it seems like to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Pardon me.  Um ...
L:  So -- and I guess I do -- sometimes my NPR station also has the BBC World Service --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- on at night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so sometimes I'll listen to that, which is at least interesting to hear another spin.
R:  Perspective, yeah.
L:  Thank being just the US.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Approach to things.
R:  Definitely.
L:  So I appreciate that.
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, like the -- The Guardian online, it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, the British paper and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I like it for the same reason.  I like y- -- like press [inaudible] that don't completely support the war --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or the president or whatever.  I'm like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wow! [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't know that a British opinion is at this point that different --
R:  Oh no, that's true.
L:  -- from the American opinion.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, and then I like sometimes when the BBC also has, you know, there's somebody in India and you have no -- I have no idea what's happening in India but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, there are these huge things going on or wherever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the case may be.
R:  Yeah.  And but even like -- even though like, Britain was totally supportive of the war like -- like, there's still a lot more acknowledgement of public dissent than there was in the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- media here I think.
L:  Yeah, I agree with that.
R:  Which is heartening --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- always.  Maybe it like -- maybe this phone thing it's -- like, appeals to people who are maybe more poor or more interested in doing strange things [LAUGH] in their spare time!
L:  Right.  Well, see --
R:  And --
L:  -- and I know I saw about it online.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so I think probably people who are finding out about it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- are in some ways that selected sample of people who are fairly plugged into the Internet --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and all of that kind of stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which might make you more likely to at least be maybe younger and more in touch with things than --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe.
L:  That would be my guess.
R:  Yeah.  How old are you?
L:  Twenty eight.
R:  Mhm, I'm twenty four.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  Similar.  Yeah, I -- I forget, I think it read, um, about it in like, a weekly -- entertainment weekly paper, so 
L:  Okay.
R:  But I don't know, like, it seems like they're probably [MN] 'cause it's linguistics so it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- probably like, the form of our conversation matters more than the content.
L:  That's my guess.
R:  That's what I imagine.
L:  Yes, but they just have to give us something so we don't just go, "Um, ah, um".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  For ten minutes.
R:  Actually, like, [NOISE] [SIGH] w- uh, speak the way people usually talk on the phone and whatnot.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Pretty crazy.
L:  Yep. [SIGH]
R:  Um -- uh, I'm having a show at my house tonight.
L:  Oh.
R:  And there are like, um, it's like a sort of hardcore punk show.
L:  Okay.
R:  And there are about, um, like, twenty boys here [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at the house right now, none of whom I know, and, um, they -- who are in the bands, like, they're on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tour and it's really strange.  Like, I came home --
L:  That sounds very interesting.
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I came home from work and like, there's a knock on the door and there's like a whole stream of boys walked in the house and I was like, "Oh my God!"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but they're being well behaved.
L:  So that's good.
R:  Yeah, so that's good.  Um ...
L:  So what do you do?
R:  Uh, I'm a student right now.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I work at the college, at the library, too.
L:  Okay.  What are you studying?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh --
L:  I'm in the process of quitting grad school [MN].
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yes.
R:  What were you doing at grad school?
L:  Um, clinical psychology.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I did my Masters and had been working on my PhD --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and finally decided I don't wanna do this anymore --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't have to do this anymore.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  It's funny how you can forget that when you're in school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't have to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- do that.  I -- I just started going back to school.  Like, I went --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- w- when I was right like, fresh out of high school for a couple of years and then dropped out.
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause I wasn't enjoying it at all and I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kinda there for my parents and I was like, "I'm not going back until I really want to be back" you know?
L:  Yeah.  It has --
R:  And --
L:  -- to be -- have that cost benefit thing that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- be worth it, to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- do it.
R:  Totally.  Or else it's like, a waste of time and money and ...
L:  Right, yeah.  I just started --
R:  And now I'm -- I'm getting like, s- because I'm twenty four --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm officially independent so I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- getting like, basically paid to go to school and like, having had -- having worked full time for a while like, I m- appreciate the structure of school a lot more than I did when I was there before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, I think that's really true.  I've been a TA a bunch and it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- always the older students and it's especially like, the forty year old women coming back to school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- who really care and they're not afraid to ask questions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I mean, I think there is a lot of that perspective of being there because you want to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not just because you kinda have to go to school to keep doing your thing and not get a job and have your parents pay for you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.  [MN] Yeah, I'll -- I'll -- I'm in a lot of classes actually with -- with like, [inaudible] the forty year old woman set who like, have had kids and are like, "I'm gonna focus on me for a while" and it's really been rad getting to know them.
L:  Yeah, I think that's been really neat in my experience.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when I was an undergrad there weren't -- it was pretty much all college age people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- grad school experience, there's been a little bit more of a range.
R:  So do you go to the school in Milwaukee then?
L:  Um, I went to a small private college called Beloit[?] College --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- which nobody's ever heard of.
R:  I've heard of it.
L:  Oh!  It's for --
R:  I don't know why, but yeah.
L:  -- for my undergrad.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I've been going to the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for grad school.
R:  Huh.  Do you like -- like if you don't like a --
L:  But I'm pretty much actually done.  No.  Oh, I hate my department. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That sucks!
L:  So ...
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] my partner is really into, um, the idea of Madison.
L:  Mhm.
