L:  Hi, my name's --
R:  Hello.
L:  -- Paula.
R:  Hi, and my name is Kim.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm kinda tired tonight.
L:  Yeah, me too.  I thought I'd go ahead and do this while I was thinking about it.  Um, I guess we're --
R:  Is that how you got on?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- okay, this is so weird because they call me and I watching Martha Stewart. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, were you watching the movie?
R:  I had two TVs at the same time because ABC had a special on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I -- I forgot about it.  Half the time I forget. [LAUGH]
L:  I do too.  I have the same problem, I --
R:  So then you call and then they hook you up live with somebody?
L:  Yes, it is --
R:  So we have to talk for ten minutes? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, and it's so much easier, I've already done two of 'em and I just call so they don't call me, and I can do it whenever I want to instead of, you know, the times that I've set up 'cause sometimes I just don't feel like it when they call.
R:  That's true.  Do you have -- [inaudible] -- well, actually the website you only do it three times and you can't do it again?
L:  Well, you can do it -- it says on the website you can do it three times but on the email it says you can do up to five per phone.  So you can sign up --
R:  Oh, and th- -- and then what happens?
L:  Um, then when you're done with the five they send you a check.
R:  Oh, okay, and then you -- you can start over again?
L:  No, you have to use a different telephone, or you can have your husband do it on the same phone, I found out today.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, if you [MN] --
R:  [inaudible] use a different telephone, and what if you don't have another phone, they just ...?
L:  Like, a cellphone you can use, if you have a cellphone.
R:  Yeah, I don't have a -- but --
L:  Or a friend's house.
R:  Oh.
L:  If you make the calls instead of having them come in.
R:  And then -- then after that can you go back to your ring- -- or you can't ever go back to your own --
L:  You can only do five on your phone.  And your husband or your boyfriend can do five on your phone.
R:  And then that's -- that's the -- the only thing you can -- then that's it?  You can never participate again, or ...?
L:  No, you just have to do it on other phones.  You can do up to five different phones, so you can only do it five times time- -- five different phones.
R:  Oh, that's kinda funny.
L:  Yeah.  That's the way --
R:  That's kinda --
L:  That's the way it's set up.
R:  That's kinda weird.  So what if you run out of phones? [LAUGH]
L:  I guess you're just outta luck, I guess.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so --
R:  How do you -- that's kinda weird.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I only have one phone, unless you -- oh, I [inaudible] use a pay phone?
L:  I don't know, I don't know if you could.  Anyway, our subject is how you keep up with current events.  It sounds like you watch TV some.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just turned off the news, I've had enough.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  That's kinda how I do too but I like to read the newspapers as well.  It's something that I enjoy doing.  We live in -- I live in a little small town and so I get, um, the newspaper from the town where I live but I also get a newspaper from, um, a city that's about eighty miles away.
R:  Oh wow, okay.
L:  And so that I have more idea what's going on around, you know.  And I'm out in my van a lot because I, you know, have -- I have a service business and so, um, I do listen to the radio and Paul Harvey some.
R:  Oh okay.  What city -- I'm -- I'm in Rochester, New York, where are you calling --
L:  You're clear in New York, I'm close to Salt Lake City, Utah.
R:  Oh my God! [LAUGH] 
L:  So we're a long ways away.
R:  You --
L:  You're -- no wonder --
R:  You're way across the country.
L:  -- you're tired.  Yeah, well, no wonder you're tired, it's eleven thirty your time.
R:  That's kinda funny.
L:  Yeah, did you check that time?
R:  That's funny.
L:  I- --
R:  What time is it there?
L:  It's nine thirty.
R:  Oh, eleven twenty four.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I figured, well, I -- well, we can talk two more minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you --
R:  I'm actually --
L:  -- only have to talk for ten and they'll come in and beep ya and -- and you're done, it's really easy.  And so [MN] --
R:  That's really weird.  You know what they ask you before hang up though, what is that number to call to ask them if you don't have like, multiple phones, I mean -- or if you use a payphone or something.
L:  You know the email you got?
R:  Oh, I don't think I saved it.
L:  Um, if you look in your delete box or whatever, um, and that email it has your PIN number and stuff on it?
R:  You know what?  I wonder if -- you know, I used Yahoo, I bet the took it off.
L:  And so I'm not quite sure what the number is 'cause I don't have my computer up when I'm on the phone.
R:  You know what?  When I call, it's so weird because you have to wait, the -- the phone doesn't register right away and I actually hung up and called back.
L:  Oh.
R:  'Cause there -- there was like, a delay of like, forty five seconds +or something.
L:  Oh, how weird.
R:  So you know what?  They did read off a number, I bet it was live.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I can call -- yeah, eight hundred number, I can get it off the recording.
L:  The recording, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I c- -- I'll check my email afterwards but it's probably gone.
L:  And it has your PIN number and stuff on it.  But you know where you signed up at the site, I think you can go to there and get some help there too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So --
R:  You know, it's kinda weird because when I signed up I had a PIN number --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from the computer, and then I had to get a different PIN number.
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  That's weird.
L:  Yeah.  And so --
R:  But, uh [SIGH] --
L:  But --
R:  -- go back to the -- the topic.
L:  Oh, yeah, we're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know --
R:  I have a radio too.
L:  [NOISE] Do you listen to radio?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, when you go to and from work?
R:  Um, yeah --
L:  Or do you t- --
R:  -- for the most part and stuff.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  You drive to and from work?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And so, um, yeah, do you, um, listen to your local news?  Is that what you get on your radios out there?
R:  Uh, yeah.  Mostly local news, radio, TV mostly.
L:  See, I'm --
R:  But see, at work I have a disadvantage, at work I -- we don't have -- we're not allowed to have any radio. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They play it real low, it's [inaudible] -- I'm at the airport.
L:  Oh, so you get kinda that funny music type things.
R:  We get -- yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they're -- I think they're taped.  They're just songs they play over and over and over.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.  So you don't get to hear of the news and what's going on in the world too much, at work?
R:  No.  A- actually, no, that is one thing I do miss.
L:  And that's really nice 'cause that's where I get a lot of mine 'cause, you know, our news comes on here at like, ten o'clock at night and I'm so tired by ten and it's like, ah.
R:  Well what do you ha- -- time do you have to get up in the morning, early?
L:  Well, um, I should be up by seven some days [LAUGH].
R:  That's early. [LAUGH]
L:  It's not terribly early, you know, it's -- but I have trouble sleeping so, you know, staying up to watch the news sometimes is kinda hard for me and so if I stay up later I have a hard time dragging myself outta bed, you know, in the morning.  I'm -- I'm not a m- -- not a morning person, I'm worse in the morning.
R:  No, either am I.  [MN]
L:  And sometimes I can catch like, the news on like, Good Morning America or some place like that, you know, but, uh, sometimes I go days without ever watching it and I'm always shocked [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Oh wow, this is going on?"
R:  Oh, you know w- -- yeah, I -- I get the -- well, I actually -- and I get a lot of interesting news from, um, email off the computer.
L:  Oh, you know, and that's true too.
R:  Actually, not the email but the computer -- Netscape and -- and Yahoo are like -- 'cause they have one corner where they'll put the highlights of what's going on around the world or country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I go in and I just hit whatever I'm interested in.
L:  Yeah.  I've seen that too.  I don't have like, one that comes directly through to my email like, you know, you can set that up for a news thing.
R:  No, I actually [MN] -- it's not a [MN] -- yeah, I made a mistake, it's not off -- while I'm checking my e- --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- before I go to check my email --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, you go to the -- the main page.
L:  It's like off your main page.  And you see it there.
R:  Yeah, the -- the main page.  And then right there is like in the corner like, stuff on, um, the terrorists, SARS.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All that other stuff that's going on.
L:  Yeah, I remember when the nine eleven attacks happened, um, I didn't have the satellite hooked up at the time and I didn't even know what was happening and I was out working in the van and I heard the news on the radio and I thought, "What on earth is that?" and I had to go a f- --
R:  I heard it -- the first time I heard it was driving to work on the radio.
L:  Yeah, me too, and so --
R:  [LAUGH] This is so weird.
L:  -- I had to go over to a friend's house and say, "Turn on the TV, something weird is happening" you know.  And it was about the time, you know, just like within five minutes the first tower collapsed and, you know.  So, but I didn't even know any of that was going on.  Sometimes I just -- I think, "Oh my goodness, I've missed so much" you know, if I don't remember to, you know, turn on the radio and stuff.
R:  It is, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  And so --
R:  Well, the --
L:  But those are kinda the main news sources that I get or use.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And so they're [NOISE] --
R:  There's a lotta -- well, there's -- I know there's a lotta different ways now with the computer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff too, but --
L:  Do you get a local paper that you read too?
R:  Um, actually no.
L:  No?
R:  I don't even spend because too much money.
L:  Too much money?  How much does it cost for --
R:  I -- I have tried to c- -- save everything I can, it just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is too much and too many -- too many different bills.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, and -- and we get the paper, uh, there's someone -- I always see the paper at work.  There's always a paper hanging around in the break room.
L:  Oh that's a good idea if you can get it at work.
R:  And my parents live real close and they got papers.
L:  [MN]
R:  They have more newspapers than I -- I don't [several inaudible words].
L:  [LAUGH] Isn't that how parents always are?
R:  Yeah.  So, if I want -- like, I go over there and I take the coupons. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  When they're done.
L:  See, I do -- I do couponing.  Are you on the RMC page by any chance?
R:  On the what?
L:  RMC, the refunding page.
R:  No.
L:  Oh okay.  I was just wondering 'cause a lotta people from this refunding page that I go to, it's called RMC, um, they do coupons and refunds and -- to help save money and stuff, and that's where I saw this survey at.  And so ...
R:  Oh, you know what, I've hooked up with some surveys on the computer.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Actually, I'm-- on the Internet I've hooked up some -- and sometimes they've s- -- I -- I've never gotten any money from doing any surveys or anything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know if they're supposed to send you something, I've never gotten anything and --
L:  I don't do a lot of the other ones --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- 'cause they're just a waste of my time.
R:  That's what I -- yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Well is this a legitimate company?
L:  Yes it is.  I- it's actually through the University of Pennsylvania and they're studying linguistics, how people converse with one another is what the purpose of it is.
R:  Oh, so they -- and they --
L:  And so --
R:  And they have a --
L:  And --
R:  [MN]
L:  The only reason I know they pay is, [MN] you know, that they do what they say they do, is because some of the ones that I've known for years on this RMC page, they have been paid.
R:  So they get paid like, a few dollars?
L:  It's ten dollars for ten minutes.  [PAUSE]  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the ten minutes that we talk, um, it would -- should end just -- in just a few seconds I would think, um, you -- is all it is.  I- I mean, it's ten dollars and you can do up to five of 'em.  [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, what we're doing now you mean?
L:  Yeah.  Just exactly what we're doing now.
