L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my nam- -- hi, my name is Laurie. 
L:  Hi, I'm Ellen. 
R:  Hi. 
L:  Hi, how are ya?
R:  Good, how are you doing?
L:  I'm fine.  
R:  Um, I get most of my news from listening to the, ah, radio in the morning and, ah, just talking to my husband.
L:  Yeah, well, I -- it depends on what's going on in the world, I guess.  Um, during the war I watched a ton of, like, facts, [NOISE] um, and the news channels, but normally when there's not something like that going on, um, yeah, I watch T.V. in the morning and listen to the radio at work, so I get most of my news that way.  By the time the newspapers come out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's old news --
R:  Old news, yeah.
L:  -- pretty much.  So I fill in sometimes if I want more detail in something, but I don't tend to read about stories much for the content in the newspapers.
R:  Do you go -- ever go online and --
L:  I don't.  Um, I -- only really occasionally -- I find too hard to -- to read stuff.  I -- I work so much on the computer at work that I don't like to read things off the computer. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  If I find something on the computer I wanna read, I usually print it out.
R:  Okay. 
L:  Which is sort of defeating the whole purpose [LAUGH] I think.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I -- I just find I -- I -- maybe because my, ah -- I have a hard time seeing the computer screen.  I have to take my glasses off to see it, and my -- I -- have my glasses off and on about a hundred times a day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, so it -- it can be annoying. 
R:  Ye- -- oh, yeah and then, you know, your eyes get, you know, you get, yeah, reading, like that, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I tend to not do that very much.  But, um --
R:  I wi- --
L:  -- T.V. I think is probably the ma- -- the major --
R:  The major, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I watched it when the war was going on, but then it kinda got depressing [LAUGH] and stuff.
L:  Yeah, it did --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- it just was so riveting though --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was hard for me not to watch.  It was, like, you were so afraid something was going to happen and you weren't going to see it happen. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's [NOISE] -- that was the -- the draw, um, because it was really the first time that you were ever able to actually watch things like that happen [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- in real time like that. [NOISE] So I --
R:  Yes, it was.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it was, like, addicting, [NOISE] yeah.
R:  W- were you?
L:  Yeah, it was y- you -- you'd be out somewhere and [inaudible] well, look, listen, I gotta go home and watch the war.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  What -- what city or what state do you live in?
L:  I live in Ohio. 
R:  Okay.
L:  In Cleveland.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, I live in California, yeah, I just -- I remember watching it when it first happened or when Bush was speaking and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then, um, yeah, I just -- I listen to the radio a lot in the morning, 'cause I have two kids and I'm with them all day, so it's kinda hard to watch --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- T.V. with them and --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't want to, um -- they're younger and I didn't want --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to expose them to that.
L:  Oh, absolutely. [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah, I don't watch a lot of T.V. [LAUGH].
L:  No, I'm sure you don't.  
R:  But --
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  Um, seven and six.
L:  Oh, my. 
R:  But, yeah, I didn't -- we didn't wanna talk about it, you know, in front of them.
L:  No, and it was --
R:  So, yeah --
L:  -- hard for adults to -- to grasp.
R:  To understand it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and watch people get blown up and --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, yeah, but.  That's not really good.  I remember in nine eleven, um, it was -- I have some -- I've nieces and nephews  -- I have a nie- -- a nephew that has children --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, [NOISE] you know, that -- it was so hard during that period of time, 'cause they were, I don't know, five and three -- well, the three year old had no idea what was going on, but the five year old did. [NOISE] You know, it was really hard because everybody was so upset and it's hard not to -- to [NOISE] transmit that to your kids and how do you explain something you don't even understand?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Really, you know, I [NOISE] -- it's tough when you got kids. 
R:  Yeah, I know.  You know, there were kids in, um -- we have close friends that our kids are the same age and it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- funny when -- I think when you leave the T.V. on and you don't think that they're watching, but they are really watching and they're picking up things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, you know, sh- -- the daughter got exposed to it and she was starting getting nightmares because she was afraid.
L:  Sure.
R:  And, you know, you -- yeah, how do you explain something that to, you know, a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- five or six year old? 
L:  Yeah, especially the --
R:  You know.
L:  -- those that lived in New York.  I can't even imagine.
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  Um, did you hear what -- what happened there the other day with them giving, um, a- approval for a plane to fly through restricted air space?
R:  No.
L:  They were bringing some service people back [LIPSMACK] and they thought it would be nice to fly them over the Statue of Liberty and then over the city of New York.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So they asked for permission to go into restricted air space.  It was -- it was a -- it wasn't a commercial jet, but it was a -- a commercial type plane.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they gave 'em permission.  And then they started flying over totally restricted airspace that people knew was restricted and here they see this plane flying around and people panicked. 
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  They thought, "Oh, my God, here it comes again".  And it just caused all kinds of just --
R:  Chaos.
L:  -- real bad stuff and it was a very bad decision, whoever made that decision.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To allow them to do that was, um -- it -- I'm sure it will never happen again.
R:  Oh, I didn't hear about that.
L:  Oh, it was I guess people were just [NOISE] --
R:  Panicking.
L:  -- [MN] oh, yeah.  I mean, you can imagine what those people must go through every time they must see a plane flying -- 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- even a little lower that they think it should be.  Even my friends here, ah, live near a, like, a county airport, and every once in a while she'll say, "You know, I heard this plane, it was flying so low -- I -- I didn't ever remember 'em being that low" and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, it -- it's hard.
R:  I know, yeah.  Th- that's, um, tha- -- nine eleven is just, um, amazing, [LAUGH] you know.  It makes you think, like, I -- when it happened I thought, "This is not over, there is something that's gotta happen --"
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  "-- after".  And I just can't believe it -- that this is it, you know.
L:  No, it isn't. 
R:  No, there's --
L:  It isn't.
R:  -- you know, it's like, we go over there, we go to, you know, and I just don't feel it's over.  I feel like they're going to come back and --
L:  Well, they've --
R:  -- do something else.
L:  -- tried, yeah, and they have -- they have tried several things and not been successful.  I don't know that they'll ever be able to pull anything of that kind of magnitude again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there will -- sure, there will be other things that they -- I don't think anybody would [NOISE] -- would say that there aren't gonna be.
R:  Yeah --
L:  And --
R:  -- but it, God, you never thought that would ever happen in --
L:  No.
R:  -- the United States.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what was so scary is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you just -- [NOISE] yeah, it's totally --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- unexpected. [NOISE]
R:  Can I ask how you got involved in this, ah, on this, ah --
L:  Um, yeah, I do mystery shopping.  
R:  Do you?  Okay. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do --
L:  And --
R:  -- too.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think most people who got into this --
R:  This --
L:  -- saw it on the posts and -- and things. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what area of California are you from?
R:  Southern California.
L:  Oh, from L.A. or ...?
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, Orange County.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah --
L:  San Diego.   
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- yeah, did you -- have you gotten paid from it -- from any of these?
L:  Not yet.  But I -- I -- oh, it was -- I -- I'm doing it relatively quickly, so, um, I -- I don't think there would have even been time, but according to the post, ah, it's -- it's totally legitimate.
R:  Yeah, I got paid last month.
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  And I -- you know, I was on the phone -- I was having company and I -- I didn't want to, um, talk, and we talked for barely two minutes and I got paid for it. 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Huh.
R:  Which was, ah, you know, I thought --
L:  And you're only allowed three times, right?
R:  Oh, it -- are you only allowed three times?
L:  I think so, is that -- have you done more than three?
R:  Well, this is my third one.
L:  Oh, okay, I think --
R:  I did one last night --
L:  -- three times, I think three times is the max.
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I know I've gotten many phone calls and I -- I haven't been home --
L:  Yeah, there's --
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  -- a couple of times I haven't been able to do it --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- or I didn't like the subject very much. [LAUGH] So I, [NOISE] um, just thought I'd wait until something better came along, but --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- it's interesting. 
R:  Yeah, it is interesting, um, talking to different people.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's interesting how the -- the technology to be able to --
R:  Connect with --
L:  -- to do -- yeah, with totally --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- by -- by computer to be able to -- to do all that is just amazing.  
R:  Yeah, I wonder what they're gonna do with all the information?
L:  I -- it's a linguistics [NOISE] thing --
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  -- I think -- I think that's what it is.  Yeah, it's a language -- something with language.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, and I think they just -- they wanna listen to people's [NOISE] speech patterns or whatever and --
R:  Oh, is that what --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- it is?
L:  -- think -- I think that's what it is.  
R:  Huh.
L:  I could be wrong.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I've been known to be wrong before, but ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- that's what I understood it to be, so, um --
R:  How long have you been doing mystery shopping for?
L:  [LIPSMACK] About three years. 
R:  Three years?  And how did you get into it?
L:  Well, I -- I knew there was such a thing, so, um, I got on the internet and just did a search for secret shopping or mystery shopping and just got into all the sites and started applying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it took a while. [NOISE] It took --
R:  Once you start applying you -- you seem to get, um, companies you know, that you can, you know, you find companies that are good and ones that --
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- aren't, you know. 
L:  And then do you -- do you -- have you gotten [inaudible]? 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  That -- that's --
L:  I mean, that's --
R:  -- a good site.
L:  -- a real --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- eye opener.  And it -- it really kinda h- helps you [NOISE] know you're not out there alone and that what you're going through a lot of other people are too, and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  It definitely is. 
L:  Yeah.  So that's the n- -- I've -- I've just actually gotten into that very recently.  [NOISE] For a couple of years, I just sort of just was on my own there. [NOISE]
R:  Did you use the internet when you started?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  It was just -- ye- -- it was just transitioning --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- over to being almost totally internet.  Um, at that point there was still some paper stuff and I still do stuff for -- some people who you still have to do the paper --
R:  Yeah, I have a couple --
L:  -- report --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some apartments and stuff.  But, um --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- mostly now it's -- if you don't have a computer and internet, you ca- -- really can't.
R:  Yeah, this is great.  You know, I'm thinking -- I remember my kids, you know, are seven and six, but when, um, they were younger I wanted to stay home and we couldn't afford to do that, and, ah, about two years ago I, um --
