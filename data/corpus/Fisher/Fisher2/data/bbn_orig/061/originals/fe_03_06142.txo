R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, [SIGH]  Wh- [LAUGH] the joke's on us there's no tone.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.  Ah, --
L:  Hi!  [NOISE]
R:  -- my name is Lenore Block.  [NOISE]  [MN]
L:  Hi, Lenore --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my name is Kim.  [SIGH]
R:  And, ah, people call me Nora so feel free to call me Nora.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Um, [MN] I keep up on current events by watching TV when I ... can stand the [LAUGH] news.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When -- but it's not -- [LAUGH] when I think maybe it won't be too depressing today.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  Okay, well I do -- I do that somewhat, ah, t- t- the same.  [SIGH]  Um, I do read our local newspaper.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [MN]  And [SIGH] I guess I get most of my ... information from my husband [MN] who reads --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, [MN] The Wall Street Journal from cover to cover and --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- claims that that's the best way [MN] to get the -- the news.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  So, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I can't say that I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the most well informed [SIGH] person in the world.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Um ...
L:  Or, nor I.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But, ah, I -- I have a sense of what's going on.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, I try to.  Sometimes it just, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, like [SIGH] September Eleventh.  [SIGH]  I didn't -- I work up --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in the afternoon and I turned on the radio and this woman was s- sobbing [SIGH] and I thought, "Wow!  She's really passionate about terrorists, but something must be wrong".  So, I -- you know went over and turned on the TV and ... I- it was just -- [SIGH] it was the kind of thing that if you saw it in a movie you would have thought, "Oh, this is too over the top."
R:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  Well, [MN] t- that particular occasion I guess I w- was called by ... someone [SIGH] to tell me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to quick turn on the television.
L:  Oh!
R:  And, ah, b- because my children were here --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and they were traveling to New York for a doctor's appointment [LIPSMACK] and, ah, they -- ah, it was my daughter in law's mother that called me --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] to ... see if I could get in touch with them to tell them to turn around and come back.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, my!
R:  So, I turned on the TV and I saw what was going on and, um, I had no way of r- reaching them.  [SIGH]  But, ah, they called me after a while and said that they heard the news on the radio [SIGH] and they were going to try to ... proceed and go over the George Washington Bridge, instead of the tunnel.  [SIGH]  And then I got a call [MN] a few minutes later that, ah, [SIGH] they heard that everything was closed down and were coming back home.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, my!
R:  So, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] [MN] yeah, [LAUGH] we were, you know, for -- I don't know where you live but, um, we're -- [SIGH] we're in Philadelphia and, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] only an hour and a half from New York.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, um, yeah, so that -- that first came from [SIGH] -- you know from a phone call.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And then I tuned into the television to watch that.  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE]  Do you work outside the home?
R:  [MN]  I, ah, I do, [SIGH] ah, part-time --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- at various and sundry things.  I'm a [SIGH] -- I'm a Red Cross, ah, CPR instructor.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Oh!
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I also, um, [LIPSMACK] -- um, do what they call standardized patient ... work, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- working at the medical schools role playing with the [SIGH] medical students.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And you?  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Oh, I used to work outside the home in an office and [SIGH] I was definitely ... better informed back then because to wake up -- [MN] while I ate my breakfast, I was getting newspapers at the time.  I no longer -- I no longer take them.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And I'd go through them and I always went through the business [SIGH] because, [SIGH] um, -- ah, where I worked --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I could often find, you know, bits of news that would be of interest to them or that they could use.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And, ah, I think I was --
R:  Is it appropriate to ask you what type of work you do?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, now, um, [MN] I'm a part timer myself but, ah, it's -- it's within the home.  [SIGH]  I call myself a bead artist, which is -- or, as I like to put it [SIGH] I'm -- I'm on disability because I have fibromyalgia and arthritis --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] but I like to say that I'm just an under -- ah, an artist that's [LAUGH] underfunded by the government.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  Ah, so I don't take a newspaper anymore because it's -- you know, it's not only extra ... money but I realized when my neighbor went away [SIGH] and I was collecting his newspaper for him [SIGH] and after less than a week I called up and I said, "Can you cancel it until, you know, such as such a date" [SIGH] because it was just too much for me.
R:  Uh-hum.  The --
L:  [MN]  You know, to go through the paper --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I felt so guilty looking at all that paper.
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]  I see.  [SIGH]  Well, that's very interesting.  [NOISE]  Um, what type of work did you do when you were ... working full time?
L:  Oh, office -- [SIGH] office work --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- I liked that because it -- usually small offices so I could g- get to do a variety of things --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] and even read the paper in between.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, well, I t- try to watch not only the American news but, ah, I catch the BBC ... news --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- about every third night.
R:  My children do that.  [SIGH]  Ah, we like to watch the news magazine shows --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- ah, from ten to eleven.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN]  I mean it's not, ah, what I -- you know, call current news but it's, ah, you know, human interest [SIGH] -- of human interest stories and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yes, things that you would have never --
R:  I- I- I --
L:  -- have heard about --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- otherwise.
R:  [SIGH]  Exactly.  I mean, [LAUGH] some of it's ... a waste of time [LIPSMACK] but [SIGH]--
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- ah, it -- you know, they -- they choose things that are fascinating for people to [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- peer into, you know, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the lives of [SIGH] people that you've [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, absolutely.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  [MN]  And, ah, [SIGH] -- and, then I -- I usually watch the eleven o'clock news before I go to sleep, [MN] if I make it through.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  It's a good thing to fall asleep with.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Mm, ah, I'm primarily a night persons so, ah, -- al- although my schedule is kind of strange, ah, -- sometimes -- ah, lately I've been doing, [SIGH] -- ah, day and a half days I guess you call them.  [SIGH]  Ah, ... it's kind of -- [SIGH] it's kind of strange in one way but as long as I hold on to a routine I don't feel unsettled.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  That's good.  [SIGH]  I'm a morning person.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  And -- um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I that's also another, ah, way that I get the news because --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [MN] I walk and I, um, always h- have my radio [SIGH] with me.  And I ... tune into, ah, ABC.
L:  Oh!
R:  I -- I can get the ch- ah, -- tel -- the Good Morning America [SIGH] on my earphones and, ah, that's --
L:  [MN]  You mean like you walk to work or you walk before you go to work?
R:  No, no, I walk for, ah, r- recreation -- [SIGH] for fitness.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I used to do that on my breaks.  I would -- ah, I'd ask my boss "Is it okay, instead of taking [SIGH] you know, two f- fifteen minutes breaks can I take them together?" --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  "Great, I'm going for a walk".  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good, good, good.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I hope you're still in the habit of doing that [SIGH] even though --
L:  [SIGH] Oh! --
R:  -- you're --
L:  Well, I was until --
R:  -- well, with your disability I guess i- it's a problem.
L:  Right.  I injured my knees --
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  -- ah, about a year and a half ago --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- you know, on top of everything else so, [SIGH] --
R:  So, ...
L:  -- [NOISE] it's been a [NOISE] process of, you know, trying to discover as they -- they're healing but very slowly.  [SIGH]
R:  Is there anything else that you can substitute like rowing or [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- swimming or ...
L:  No, that's the ... thing about fibromyalgia is your muscles get really strange and tight and hard and, [SIGH] ah, it becomes easier and easier to injure yourself.
R:  Mm.  Hm.
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, it's -- it's very frustrating for me but, ah, where I'm living ... there are [SIGH] -- I met, ah, at least a half dozen other woman with ... fibromyalgia.
R:  Hm!
L:  [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] [MN] I'd say the most depressing ... t- thing actually is coming across people who go -- [SIGH] who think that it's something you're going to get right over or you're faking it or [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- I -- I understand.  [SIGH]  I -- I think I know somebody that had it.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] she wasn't a complainer but, um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] she said that she's so limited to what she can do and it's, ah, debilitating.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, but, you know when I looked at her --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- she looked perfectly fine --
L:  Oh, yes, I look --
R:  -- [SIGH] but I saw her walk and I saw, you know there was --
L:  I -- I look very healthy and that's why it took me a year and a half to get the government to finally go, "Oh, okay" [SIGH] and that was only because I said I was depressed --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- which, [LAUGH] by that time I was.
R:  Well!
L:  Yes.
R:  What part of the country do you live in?
L:  California.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  And you?
R:  We're in Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia?
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, my!
R:  [SIGH]  We were out your way --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- last year for two weddings.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  We were in, ah, LA.  [MN]  Are you anywhere near LA -- are you?
L:  Well, I -- I was living near LA.  Now I'm living [SIGH] -- God, how many miles is it?  [SIGH]  I am about an ... ah, [SIGH] hour, hour and a half -- 'bout an hour and a half away from LA.
R:  East or west or ...?
L:  I'm -- I'm to the east.
R:  Okay, well it can't be west but ... [LAUGH] you could be --
L:  Oh, that would be nice, I'd be on a yacht.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  [LAUGH]  Or Catalina or Avalon or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Or Hawaii.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!  I think it's a little further.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right, right, right
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, are you north or south or ...?
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, no, I'm east of LA.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah, I'm ... not really ... going anywhere at this point because as soon as I got here, about two -- ten days after I -- I moved here two years ago --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] my car ... stopped running.  It's a long story.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]  I have three files. One is --
