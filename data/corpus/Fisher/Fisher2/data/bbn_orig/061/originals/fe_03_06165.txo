R:  [MN] Cuba.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  How are ya?
L:  I'm fine, how are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  Um --
R:  Uh ... [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Have -- have you done this before?
R:  [MN] Once [LAUGH] three weeks ago.
L:  Okay, me too.  Me too.  Um, I guess I could start, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, I guess I mostly -- I would say I definitely keep up with current events by watching the news [NOISE] because that's mostly what I watch.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I could certainly watch the news --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- three hours a day.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Between -- between like, local news and things like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Good Morning America and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [SIGH] --
R:  Oh well --
L:  -- that's mostly how I keep up with things.
R:  I'm quite the opposite.  Like, I n- [SIGH] I never turn on my TV. [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I mostly get news from like, MSN --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, websites and, um, CNN.  Like, I have the little news alerts that come on and my AOL, every time it comes up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have like, the little breaking news and, you know, news alerts and stuff like that.  That's like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the only n- news I get.  I check it like, ten times a day [LAUGH] just to --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- make sure I know what's going on. [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, TV, I'll never get news on. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I come home --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm gone to bed. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My TV doesn't come on.
L:  Um, yeah, my -- well, I'm not -- I never get to turn my p- -- my computer on here at home 'cause I'm dealing with the kids and stuff, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when I go to work [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when I should be -- when I should be working --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, I usually will log on to my hotmail.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, I've gone done reading my, you know, what's in my inbox --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I will go, you know, the -- and listen to news or whatever, the homepage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that would be my best.  It's definitely my best bet.
R:  Yeah, that's the same -- that's the same thing for me, like, I -- I look at my hotmail and then I log out, it's like [NOISE] I just usually leave the screen up and then I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sit there and I [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I'm bored I just go back to it like, "Okay, what's going on?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  The sad thing is, is that I get the paper delivered every day.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  And I never, never look at it.
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Ever.  The only reason I started getting it is to get the coupons out of the Sunday paper.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  And then they said, "Well, you can get it seven days a week --"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  "-- for the same price" and I'm like, "Okay".
R:  Oh yeah, okay.
L:  So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I usually -- if I think about it in the morning we'll like, take it to the babysitter so at least she can look at it.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  But I never --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get a chance to.
R:  I usually [NOISE] buy the paper just on Sunday.
L: Uh-huh.
R:  But -- [MN] [MN] that's really what I buy it for too, like, coupons.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'll go through it sometimes and just like, and browse, like just skim really fast and just try to get like, main points of what's going on each section and [SIGH] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  I do that sometimes, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- most of my news comes from the computer 'cause I'm staring at it all day, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] might as well get some -- some use out of it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. [NOISE]  Well that's cool.
R:  Have you been keeping up with a lotta like, the war [NOISE] stuff and ...?
L:  Have I?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I've actually tried not to -- not keep, uh, keep it on the TV [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because of the kids. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  I don't [NOISE] [LAUGH] [inaudible] got to be --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all they saw.  Now, my husband on the other hand --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he watches it a lot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, he d- -- he really did.  Um, but no, I mean, I would try to ... I guess find out what was going on once a day.
R:  Yeah.  And then --
L:  If nothing else.  But I'm up pretty late after they're in bed, like at eleven an stuff, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] it's easier.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to keep --
R:  I know when it -- when it first started I used to -- I would be on MSN every day [LAUGH] -- every, you know, ten times a day checking like, what's going on?  But now it's like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- like, other news -- they're finally posting other news, you know.  For a while it was like that's all they ever posted.
L:  Right.  Right.  There was nothing else going on. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  It was there was like no -- had no choice, even I -- if I wanted to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, find out about other news.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I remember one day they actually had on there, you know, news that you've missed because of the war. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it was like all the news that had happened [NOISE] like, in the past month or whatever.
L:  That's pretty bad.
R:  That no one had heard about. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you -- you think, wow, nobody has gotten killed in the city or --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, there's not really any kind of burglaries --
R:  It's like, no crime, no [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't think [inaudible].
L:  And you know there had to be but [LAUGH] --
R:  Right! [LAUGH]  It's like, and no one cares anymore because of the war. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] but other than that -- I'm trying to think of any other current -- I just can't even -- I watched -- isn't that sad, I watch it every day but I don't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- can't even think.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I guess the big -- well, that's not really big but I guess two weeks ago was, um, the Lacy Peterson story.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Two or three weeks ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, you know, well, what's going on with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- her husband.
R:  Yeah, that was down in --
L:  But, um --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I can't think of anything big right now.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't think they've had anything, uh, major.  They -- I did see today though that, um, [LIPSMACK] Bush's spokesperson resigned [inaudible].
L:  Who?
R:  President Bush's -- his spokesperson.
L:  The --
R:  He's gonna -- he's resigning.
L:  Airy[?] Flight[?] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it Airy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  He's resigning in -- in the summer.
L:  Did it say why?
R:  He said he wants to do something more relaxing [LAUGH].
L:  He wanted to do what?
R:  He wants to do something more relaxing.
L:  Oh, relax --
R:  [LAUGH] Which I -- I can't blame him. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh my God, no kidding.
R:  So, yeah, that was in the new- -- that was on the headlines today. [SIGH]  And he's -- I think he's recently married or something like that, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- he wants to spend time with his wife, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Wow.
R:  So bits of the [LAUGH] news I remember. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] I can't --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] [MN]
L:  I'm watching, um -- actually watching The Martha Stewart Story right now, so that --
R:  Oh really? [LAUGH]

R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a year or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so ago. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words] would be trouble. [SIGH]
R:  Right.  And I'm sitting here with my TV off. [LAUGH]  Like, I don't know.
L:  That would be so great if we did that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, unfortunately in this house we have --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- we have --
R:  It's such a waste too.

R:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh [inaudible]. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's such --
L:  And -- and it's so sad.  I mean, the only reason I think we have cable, 'cause everything I watch is on regular television.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like non pay channels.
R:  Right.
L:  The only reason we have cable is so my husband can watch sports.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's it, that's it.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] I -- I really need to get rid of cable.  Like, I -- I can't because I don't get any TV reception if I don't have cable.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  But, uh, it's so pointless.  I never come o- --

R:  To entertain the guests! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]

L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words]
R:  But --
L:  But he's a big +sports -- sports fanatic, so --
R:  Yeah, it's worth it though for sports. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'll just say that. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not even a huge fanatic but --
L:  [LAUGH]

R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they w- -- those babies were called like, post nine eleven sympathy babies.
R:  Really?  Is it like another boom?
