L:  Hi, uh, my name is Angela [NOISE] from Portland, Oregon.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name's Kim and I'm from, um, Eaton, Ohio.
L:  Well hi.
R:  Hello.  I hear you have a dog.
L:  Um, actually it's the neighbor's dog. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, so we're supposed to talk about current events, huh?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay, um, I'll start then.  Um, well, okay, I -- I don't like watching the news anymore really because it seems very much [NOISE] like bad news, bad news, bad news all the time and they never report on anything else and it's always like -- especially when the war was going on, it was just like that's all you could find, so I pretty much read most of my news online now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, like, I have my [NOISE] home page online is Yahoo [NOISE] and they have like, the top stories listed on the side so I always read that and I read local news and, um, 'cause that way it's more [NOISE] indepth, more broad coverage [NOISE] than just, you know, the commercialized version that you get on the local news usually, so --
R:  Right.
L:  That's -- that's pretty much -- I don't read the paper.  I do read, um, Newsweek.  I do really, really, really like Newsweek 'cause they're not -- that's how I find out about stuff I normally would never hear about [NOISE], you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's [NOISE], you know, other parts of the United States or the world and, uh, you know, I like to keep up on news as much as possible, I don't wanna be all like, ignorant, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So that's pretty much is -- I pretty much read all my news, not in a paper but online and in magazines and stuff.  Occasionally if there's something earth shattering going on, you know, like nine eleven of course --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, my TV was on all day for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about a week, but -- until you just had to turn it off, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, that's pretty much it for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] I sometimes watch the news.  I have an eight month old now so I don't get a chance to do that very often.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, congratulations.
R:  [MN] Thank you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I probably read most of my news, like, I have the Yahoo home page as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I know what you're talking about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Handy. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah!  I -- I usually don't even click on the links though, I just see what's going on and unless something interests me then I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really pay much attention to it.  But I also subscribed to the newspaper so I usually kind of flip through it while I'm eating dinner --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and kinda keep myself up to date, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] other than that, that's basically --
L:  The news- -- the newspaper kind of overwhelms me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  'Cause it's like, so much paper.
R:  Right.
L:  And I never [LAUGH] know -- I usually end up reading up the comics and [LAUGH] that's it!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So it's like, I'm -- you know, I mean, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would probably -- like, if I got the paper I'd probably get like, the Sunday paper or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where, you know, it's a lot of stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all in one.  But, you know, I mean, I find that you pay attention more when you read something too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Instead of just -- when you're just watching TV you don't really -- you only gain like, I don't know, you don't -- you can totally phase it out.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, I find if --
R:  It's very easy --
L:  I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  No, it's all right, I was just like, it's very easy for it to be background almost, you know?
R:  Mhm.  I find that if I see something on TV that -- that I'm trying to remember then I usually forget it but if it's in the paper I can always go back and look, whereas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I can't go back and watch the news again unless I --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- hope they have the same story on, which unfortunately around here they do that quite a bit.
L:  Well, and the other nice thing about reading it online is that, um, if there's anything related to it they usually have links.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so you can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  D- you just, you know, really get the indepth perspective.  Like, I know on Yahoo if you actually click on the link and you read one of those stories --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all along the left side they have like, [MN] related stories --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and other stories on this topic and -- and, um, you know, like, did you s- -- I don't know if you saw the thing today about this Danish guy who was being sued for art exhibit where he had live goldfish inside blenders?
R:  Oh my gosh! 
L:  It was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  W- when would you hear about that other than on the Internet?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Never.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  You know, that's just -- that's current event but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's one of those abstract ones that you're like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "What?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it w- -- yeah, he got sued by animal rights activists 'cause --
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  -- it's an art exhibit but y- you know, [MN] they allow you to push the blender if you want to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and kill the fish.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And, uh, he -- he won because they had some expert that said, you know, "I- death would have been instantaneous so it would've been really humane".
R:  Oh my gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] But would --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, if you like, fish are fish, or you know, like, uh, the way -- if you feed feeder fish to a fish in your --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- aquarium it takes longer to die than in a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- blender, so -- but --
R:  Well, I was, um, watching the news this morning and on TV it [MN] they said that there was a new world record in -- they had some guy, I don't even know where he was from, but he has the record for having the longest ear hair. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm like, you know, this is really --
L:  That's what --
R:  -- really newsworthy and I've --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've lost that couple of minutes in my life watching this stupid story. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and they had a world record set this weekend by schoolgirls in Ger- Germany for reading aloud.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The longest reading aloud.  It was like, two and a half days or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just like, you could probably [inaudible] set a world record for anything nowadays. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  The longest ear hair, that -- that's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I'm glad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he worked hard and got some recognition for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't know how he went about measuring it or anything --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but [LAUGH], I mean, that's --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- pretty disgusting.
L:  I'm s- -- I'm sure they have an official --
R:  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  -- measuring instrument. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  But yeah, so -- and, uh, I'm -- I'm just waiting for the day when I can have my flat panel monitor in my kitchen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I can just like, read the news while I'm making [LAUGH] breakfast, you know.
R:  Yeah, here you go.
L:  Mm.  You know, 'cause --
R:  I keep telling my husband that I just need a laptop computer so I can just take it wherever I go but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's not buying into the idea.
L:  But, you know, I ha- -- I just got one for work.
R:  Did you?
L:  And I -- and I'm allowed to take it home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, man you start to get really spoiled with that thing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because --
R:  I'm sure you do.
L:  -- like, you -- you just take your computer everywhere and you're just like, in class you're doing three things at once --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, working on Excel spreadsheets and taking notes and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I -- I'm j- -- I'm finishing up my bachelors, two more classes and, uh -- so it's like, "Hey, I'm gonna work on the wedding list while I'm, you know, [LAUGH] --"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  "-- listening to this lecturer and --"
R:  [LAUGH] So you're getting married too?
L:  N- my sister.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  My goodness.
L:  -- yeah, it's -- it was, uh, they're definitely handy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] G- you're just busy.
L:  Yes, yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] But you still --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- make time to read the news, or --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and -- and that's the other thing, is, um, it really saves time, I find, um, you know, 'cause they really sum up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, the top stories and they ch- update 'em about four times a day on that list.
R:  Right.
L:  And so that's my home page, it's pretty much up all the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just glance at it and see if there is anything that I'm interested in reading about, and then, you know, you just click on it, you know, today.  And even if I don't read it the headline tells me kind of what happened, so you know, I g- -- I know today World Com had to pay out, you know, like, five hundred million dollars for fraud.
R:  Oh my goodness.
L:  I didn't read the story but that's what the headline said, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at least I know it's out there and --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- usually the top three links are government related and I just [LAUGH] ignore them!
R:  Skip over those.
L:  Like, oh, some politician said something to some other country and --
R:  Oh geez.
L:  -- that's wonderful and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- exciting but I don't really c- -- I -- I s- saw that Ari Fleischer resigned though, today.
R:  I did see that as well. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that was like --
R:  Although I did not read it! [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't read it either [LAUGH] but I saw the headline!  Exactly.  It's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- thirty second news.  All right, I read the headlines, I'm good. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I got --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- frustrated today because I was up at five o'clock with my son and I just -- I flipped -- I have a little five inch TV in my kitchen and I flipped it on and it was on most of the morning and from five o'clock to nine o'clock they had news on and it was just -- every half hour was a constant repeat of the previous --
L:  The same --
R:  -- half hour.  And I'm like, you know, how many times do we need to report this?
L:  Right.
R:  And then at five o'clock they had the same thing on.
L:  Exactly.  It's like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] And --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the thing is, you don't -- if you were to go, you know, they always, you know, these local stations now have, you know, they all have a website.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you go there and there's like all these stories.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're like, "Why aren't you reporting on this stuff? --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- Why is it only on your website?"  It doesn't -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to me that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, i- in Oregon right now it's all about the budget.  Everything's about the budget.  Budg- --
R:  Gee, that's how it is here too.
L:  School funding, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're in national news because our -- our schools are like, thirty days cut out of the schedule and -- and -- but how many times can you hear that?  You understand --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that it's going on and everything but, you know, it shoves all the rest of the news, 'cause they spend fifteen minutes talking about it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then they've gotta do weather for five minutes and that leaves --
R:  [SIGH] And don't forget traffic.
L:  Right.  And so that leaves --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, what, seven minutes for the rest of the stuff that's going on in your city?  It's just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- I -- I don't think -- I mean, uh, you know, they'll never go out of business or anything but, uh, I -- I don't think that they're very effective actually reporting news.
R:  No.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I know a lot of 'em -- we have one particular --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- station here, they are constantly making mistakes and it's like, [LAUGH] you know --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh --
R:  "You guys re- --"
L:  Yesterday we saw --
R:  "-- really should try to correct these".
L:  That's just terrible.
R:  I know.
L:  That's just -- and i- it's like every -- you could like, go to any city and every news channel's like, the same.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The same -- they look the same, they talk the -- it's like, the same.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Oh, you know, we've
