R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [SIGH]  Hello?
L:  Hi, this is Lisa.
R:  Hi, Lisa.  This is Roxetta Gilliam.  [SIGH]
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Good.  [SIGH]  Ready to talk about the topic?  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes.
L:  Have you ever done this before?  [SIGH]
R:  No.  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, th- they started me last Monday night, so ... [SIGH] it's kind of weird because they only put two people on and I thought it'd be more people.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess the current event -- ah, the topic is current events and how we get them.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, I guess mostly I get mine from the radio or my friends, how about you?
R:  Ah, I get mine off of, ah, TV or through [NOISE] the Internet.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.  [MN]  Yeah, sometimes [NOISE] I glance at the current events on the Internet.  I use it mainly for work, though, so I don't get to look at it as much.  [LIPSMACK]  And when you s- say current events, what do you consider more current events, newsworthy stuff or trivial stuff?
R:  Well, what I consider current events?  [SIGH]  Well, I've, ah, -- I consider the things that are going on -- I live in Charlotte, North Carolina [SIGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I like to keep up with what's going on in Charlotte.  [SIGH]  Um, I guess one of the things is right now one of the most current events is the schools and safety.  [SIGH]  And I like to keep up with what's going on in Iraq and Iran --
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  -- and with the, ah, serviceman.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, next weekend's Memorial Weekend so it's good to keep up with the servicemen.  [SIGH]  My next door neighbor's son he was, um, [LIPSMACK] in the reserves and they sent him to Germany and then they sent him home for a little while, and now they're sending him back over to Iraq.  [SIGH]  So, ... [MN] I got a little bit of current events from --
R:  With this -- with this particular war [SIGH] -- usually I have a brother in the Navy, one of the Airforce [SIGH] and two in the Marines, but thank God this time they've all retired.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  So, they're home safe and sound?
R:  Yeah, they're home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're concerned, you know, they are -- you know, they're really, really concerned.  [SIGH]
L:  So, do you get i- information from them as well that you wouldn't get?
R:  Well, one -- one of them, 'cause he's still works for the military, every once in a while he will [SIGH] send me a email, you know, [SIGH] "In case you didn't know" ah, such and such and such.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  That's good, a- at least you -- you're well informed.  I think my current events is more like -- I'm from New York City so I guess, [SIGH] like, um, [LIPSMACK] what's going on with the MTA up here.  I don't know if you're aware, [SIGH] they have two sets of books sent.  And, ah, they wanted to raise the fares on us and, um, [MN] they just got a Court order -- the fares got raised but then they got a Court order to halt the raise and to go backwards and give a refund until --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they show both sets of books --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because supposedly they cooked one set [LIPSMACK] but nobody can now find this mysterious second set.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then, um, [SIGH] our current events, the big thing on the radio this morning about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] the war with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Deck of Cards, but not the one that everybody's been talking about --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Deck of Cards is all the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- celebrities that are stupid enough to support Saddam, you know, like Martin Sheen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and all those, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really radical people.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But ... [LIPSMACK] but, um, yeah, I think I get most of it from the radio --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they just have discussions with people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that's how I get my information, you know.  But I think that's cool that you have people in the military, 'cause I'm sure [LIPSMACK] it helps you to follow the war a lot better.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  And what's going on with your schools down there?  You were saying something.
R:  Well, they've had this, ah, [SIGH] -- where the schools are supposed to be desegregated.  [SIGH]  Now they're trying to send children to neighborhood schools.  [SIGH]  Now they have twenty seven schools that nobody wants their kids to go to.
L:  Oh, no!
R:  So, ... [SIGH] people that haven't [NOISE] been placed will probably be placed in those schools, [SIGH] which are schools in the poorer areas.  [SIGH]  And, unfortunately, what it's going to end up being, ah, is that the [SIGH] -- most of the hispanic kids and black kids are going to be put back into those schools, [SIGH] and people that live [NOISE] in better neighborhoods will go to the better schools.  So, it's -- it's a fight.  [MN]
L:  And it's going to be really hard.  [SIGH]  They don't have, um, [LIPSMACK] any of the teachers from Teach for America down there do they?  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Ye- -- I'm not sure because I don't really have -- I have a granddaughter but she's in, ah, ... private school --
L:  Okay.
R:  So, you know, I really, really, you know, don't know.
L:  Yeah, because that's the only way they've been getting ... good teachers to go to poorer ar- areas is [SIGH] they join up Teach for America --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they get paid at the slightly better salary 'cause it doesn't necessarily come from the school system, [MN] and then they have to promise to stay there for two years.  [LIPSMACK]  But I think [SIGH] there's only like the major cities.  I think it's like, ah, New Orleans, [SIGH] New York City, Chicago, some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- place out west.  I don't think it's California.  Maybe it was like Vegas or something.  [SIGH]  But I -- [MN] you know, they should definitely place --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people further around.  [SIGH]  So, ... [LIPSMACK] okay, so schools, transit, [LAUGH] [SIGH] um, the war; what else is a -- a current event that you follow?
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, well, I guess the -- the next thing is unfortunately we've had several, [SIGH] ah, murders in areas that usually don't have things like that, as the area -- they're considered a safe area.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And, ah, they've had several robberies [SIGH] -- robberies in there and ... so that's of, ah, concern.
L:  Yeah, we have a --
R:  And it's a area where they said, "Stuff can't happen like that here!"  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  "It never happens to us" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- until it happens --
R:  Right, you know --
L:  -- and then they're, like, all of a sudden aware.
R:  -- it's a quiet neighborhood where they say they used to leave their doors open and things like that.  So, ...  [MN]
L:  Wow!
R:  And in the same area a lady was raped in her f- -- her own apartment --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- but it was someone that she knew.
L:  Oh, God that's horrible.
R:  You know, nobody's dog barked or anything because evidently [SIGH] the person was in and out of the house all t- the time.  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  That's -- that -- I think that's got to be worse because you put your trust in somebody and then they turn around and do that to you, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We have, um, [SIGH] speaking of r- rapists, ah, that was in the news too but it was like a smaller thing because they have, um, [LIPSMACK] a serial rapist running around.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But [SIGH] you know, I guess he's not attacking -- he's attacking sporadically.  [SIGH]  But then I was in my bank before and I -- I guess I forgot about it and there was [SIGH] a drawing of him up in the bank and I was like, "Wait, there was a guy outside that looked like him" but, [SIGH] you know, it was just such a general drawing --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that it could have been anybody, [SIGH] you know?
R:  Yes, well that's what happens when they do the drawings.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it does, you know, unless somebody says, "Oh, that looks like so and so".  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  But then it makes -- you know, it makes you nervous, like, you don't pay as much attention until you see something that sparks it off and you're like you said, "Oh, yeah, we don't need to unlock -- you know, lock our doors it's safe here".  Until it happens to them [SIGH] and then all of a sudden they become more aware of that event than, [SIGH] you know, other things that are going on.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And like I find out a lot about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] the murders around here because I used to be engaged to a police officer [SIGH] and every once in a while he'll call me up and he'll tell me, like, what's going on in my own neighborhood, you know.  [SIGH]  It's funny, he'll call me up and go, [LIPSMACK] "I was thinking about you.  A murder happened.  We found a murder victim last night".  I'm like, "Good reason to think about me".  He's like, "No, no, no, I was just calling to make sure you're safe", you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, it's a weird way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to find out.
R:  Mm.
L:  But sometimes I find out before --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it makes the news.  So, ...
R:  So, are you now in Philadelphia or New York?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  New York.
R:  Okay.  Uh-hum.
L:  New York City.  I'm actually in the Bronx.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  But, um, [SIGH] [MN] I'm in the Bronx -- where you probably [LAUGH] wouldn't even think exists in the Bronx there is, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I live on the water and my best friend lives on an island in the Bronx.  Actually, the island's been in the news a li- -- a little bit lately because, [SIGH] um, in January four ... kids took a rowboat out of City Island, four --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teenagers, sixteen to eighteen, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and, um, they drowned.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And they're just finding the bodies now and, um, they found one yesterday so that was in the news.  But, um, [MN] I tend -- those bodies because my friend lives on the island, she owns a restaurant on the island, I tend to find out from her or her customers or her family [SIGH] [MN] before it h- hits the news.  You know, she'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- call and she's like, "They found another kid, you know, isn't that sad?" like, they're just [SIGH] -- it's s- sad because [SIGH] the mother who organized all the search parties, h- her son is the fourth son that's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- missing and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- all the other boys --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- turned up f- first, you know.  But it -- it's -- [SIGH] like they're just waiting 'cause now they know it's been four months that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] he's not around -- you know.  He's probably not alive --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but they just want the body to have, you know, the c--- the closure.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But sometimes it's very sad how I -- you know, most of my ... current events that I --
R:  [NOISE]  Hm.
L:  -- hear are the horrible --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stuff through friends.  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]  Are you still on line?
R:  Yes, I'm still here.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  No, my husband just asked me a question.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]  No, I -- just 'cause sometimes I can hear my dogs are eating their dinner now.  [LAUGH]  So, they're in the other room and, ah, like they're just gnawing away.  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  But, um, --
R:  [MN]  And I guess the next thing that would be really current events here [SIGH] are there -- ah, like -- like in New York they're thinking about going up on the bus fare.  [NOISE]
L:  But -- yeah, that's right.
R:  And it's -- to me it don't make sense to go up on the bus fare because it's not like you could just walk out your door -- walk down the street and get on a bus.  [SIGH]  'Cause if you catch a bus [SIGH] you have to go to the center of town, then get another bus to get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to where you're going.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, [SIGH] ah, --
L:  Yes, if they're going to raise fares you'd think they --
R:  -- some place that you could drive in twenty minutes may take you ... two hours to get there.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  Wow!  That happens here too.  Like, [SIGH] unless you're going to stay in the same borough, [SIGH] if you take the subway or the bus -- like, if you try to go, [SIGH] 'cause you're crossing a lot of water you know -- if you're trying to go to Queens or Manhattan or Brooklyn, [SIGH] it takes a lot longer [SIGH] if you're not in your car --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you try to take the bus or the train --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  Like the only quick thing to take the train is to actually go from one of the outer boroughs into Manhattan because [SIGH] the traffic in Manhattan is horrible, [LIPSMACK] but once you hit the outer boroughs you're just better off [SIGH] taking a car than a bus.  And it's sad because it's -- [SIGH] generally the people who can't afford, you know, who -- who that extra fifty cents or whatever the -- the raise is [SIGH] -- who can't afford it as much.
