R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, this is Michelle. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is Randy.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [NOISE] Um, what -- what was the [MN] -- current events?
L:  Yes.  The topic is current events and how we get most -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, how we get the information.
R:  I think that, uh -- I -- I guess I'll go first and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I get most of my current events probably from the TV and we also get the newspaper in which I directly go to the classifieds and the funnies.  So, my husband, um, points them out to me.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah, mine's is usually -- is the same.  The newspaper and the t- -- and the television and, um, usually, um, usually it's the television first.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause I put on, um, as soon as I get up in the morning I make the coffee with the TV in the -- in the kitchen.  So, I put it on and, you know, listen to what's going on until my son gets up and then it goes on Nickelodeon. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you know, I remember when I was a child I couldn't stand [NOISE] the news being on and now it's like I don't shut it off. 
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  During the war time it was always like CNN and, yeah.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] I know.
R:  So, and -- and sometimes I listen to the radio and I find out, you know, things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that are going on, on the radio but only when I'm driving.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I never ha- -- the only time I have the radio on also is when I'm driving and then usually it's music and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then after a while I get tired of the music so I --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- put on a CD.
R:  Well, when you have children, you know, it's amazing how, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much noise bothers you after a while. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I thought I'd be a head banger my whole life but I can't stand, uh, the Rap music now and [LAUGH] --
L:  I -- I know.  I was never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into Rapp music anyway.  So --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  That was definitely not one of my things.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, usually g- -- I -- I'll get it from, um, [LIPSMACK] you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I usually just read the newspaper which I was doing now when they called.  'Cause I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- thought I had time to be able to sit down for a few minutes and read it.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, 'cause we're in New York so the weather has finally been nice.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay. You're in the --
R:  Where it rains constantly.
L:  [LAUGH] But --
R:  But it's green here.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- [inaudible] was about[?] to say, but it's pretty there.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But it -- you know, there is a lot of rain and a lot of grey days.  So 
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  I've only been to New York once --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I did a lot of looking up so I imagine everybody knew I was a tourist. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think everybody looks ups -- up -- looks up. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I heard later, you know, a couple of years later that that's how the New Yorkers tell that you're a tourist is because, you know, they are always looking up at the tall buildings.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, and the New Yorkers are always looking down to, you know, to get to work. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's true though.
R:  Yeah.  Um, you know, it's, uh -- I was amazed at, um, the amount of people who don't drive in New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They all take taxis.  And then when you get outside of, you know, the bigger cities and stuff that how, you know, quaint little country towns and stuff, they're beautiful.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's, um, parts of it that's, know, very, know, touristy and very quaint and stuff like that and then you got the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- city.  'Cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm on Long Island.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah, [NOISE] so we have our li- -- our share of quaint little towns also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I'm a bad mother making my son his dinner now.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] What time is it there?
L:  Six thirty.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's -- yeah, getting dinner time around there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My daughter just got home from school.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Speaking of school, I have -- my son has a book report due tomorrow [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and he does not wanna do it.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Do you -- how old is your son?
L:  He's six.
R:  Oh, so he's not reading the newspaper and getting current events either quite yet is he? [NOISE]
L:  No.  But we -- but he was really into --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, with nine eleven.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, when we had nine eleven, you know, last year and then we had the an- -- the first --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- year anniversary; he was really into that and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he only wanted to watch the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- news.  But he's actually a very big --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hockey fan.  
R:  Yeah? [NOISE]
L:  And so like he'll, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He'll pu- --
R:  [NOISE] Follow the --
L:  He'll put on -- 
R:  -- hockey teams.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Follows the hockey teams.
L:  Follows the hockey teams.  So, he'll put on CNN --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to get some glimpse of, um, [LIPSMACK] of the hockey team.  He plays soccer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, he'll, know, he'll put on the n- -- you know, like the sports news --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to, um, find out what's going on and he's like really into the computer with America Online and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the stuff for that.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  It's amazing.
R:  Well, I guess I -- I guess I do get some of my, you know, information from Online.  It's usually, um, [NOISE] people commenting on emails and stuff because I belong to so many email groups.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know, they will say things about what's going on in the world but I d- -- usually don't like go to the news places there.  My home page, um, you know, I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really pay much attention to that except for current movies coming out.  
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I don't -- yeah, I don't do -- the same thing.  I b- -- I -- I belong to a couple of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] You know, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- online groups and they'll -- they'll go in; they'll look up -- look up a couple of things and they'll just mention what's going on and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sometimes it gets very catty in them and, um, you know, so I just follow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that.  But like -- it seems it's like, you know, just forget the newspaper --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, you know, I just tried reading an article about, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, here in -- you know, I don't live very far from Levittown[?] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is where one of the f- -- the first, you know, suburbia was.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, after World War Two. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So there were, you know, there's new article now about how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and there's a PBS special about how the black -- black people or African Americans were denied access to hou- houses there.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  So, you know, I've tried reading that 'cause that seemed pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah, that is interesting. [NOISE]
L:  But, um, yeah, so that's, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It's just basically the TV and the newspaper.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Mostly the TV.
R:  [NOISE] Um, is -- is your newspaper pretty large?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  [NOISE] See, I live in Salem, Oregon and I comment on things like, uh, misspelling [MN], you know, backwards kind of hick people, um, because they can't even spell and they're -- they call themselves journalists and [NOISE] the newspaper on some days is really small and, [NOISE] you know, um, there are some places around here that get newspapers like once a week.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, it's really small. 
L:  No, this is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh -- now this is, know, a pretty, you know, it's -- it's, you know, called Newsday.  It's pre- -- you know, pretty well quoted.  They've got, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, they usually win a couple of Pulitzer prizes each year.  So, it's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so it's a pretty, um, well respected newspaper.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, they do -- and no they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- focus mostly on Long Island.  They also do, know this -- they also have like, know, they used to have, um, a portion of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- city but they don't do that any more.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, our classifieds here are maybe two pages.
L:  Oh, no [inaudible].  No, we've got like a whole section of classifieds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Good coupon -- good coupons out of them too.
R:  Oh, really?  We have one day of coupons.
L:  Oh.
R:  I think it comes out on Wednesdays and --
L:  Yeah, we have the -- the coupons on the Wednesdays but we get all like -- like when all the, um, [LIPSMACK] the major, you know, like on S- Saturdays or Sundays here.  They deliver on Saturdays. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like all the major coupons are out for the week.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, we'll get those.  So, like some people across the country get like maybe one or two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- supplements of coupons.  We'll get, you know, all -- if there's four, we'll get all four of them.  So, it's pretty good.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, yeah.  Now, you make me wanna move 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I already  I -- my husband's from Hawaii and I already -- and we've been all over the United States and I comment all the time about how backwards this place is and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and everything.  So, yeah.
L:  Wait -- wait.  So, he's from Hawaii.  How did you get stay on in Arlick[?], Oregon?
R:  His mother, um, got pregnant with him when she was thirteen.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, um, they w- -- you know, um, [NOISE] the -- I guess the Asian ki- kind of families, you know, they shun the -- the girls who --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- get pregnant out of wedlock and stuff and so they were sent to the Mainland.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so that's how he ended up over here and, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, he's -- he's friends with his family in Hawaii and stuff and we still go over there but [NOISE], um, he -- he used to surf and he used to, um, surf in Hawaii and Australia and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything.  So -- and one of his cousins actually is a [NOISE] -- is a -- I guess a champion surfer and he still is surfing and everything now.  So [NOISE]   Yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah, and [inaudible] don't surf much when we're in Oregon.  There is no surf here.  You know, there's -- we do boogie boards and things like that but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And go scuba diving but there is no way the surf's here.
L:  I -- I would -- yeah I would imagine it'd be also t- -- very cold over there too.
R:  It is.  Yeah, you wear a wet suit and -- and go boogie board if you're gonna be on a board here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, scuba diving is -- is kind of fun here and they have all kinds of, you know, different reefs and things here.
L:  Yeah, my -- my, um, [LIPSMACK] my brother in law and sister in law lives in, um, right outside San Francisco.  They go up to Oregon, um, once a year.  There's some sort of island there that, you know, that they go to a lot.  It's really beautiful they say and very [NOISE] rustic.  I don't know the name of it.
R:  Um, where the whales migrate? [NOISE] 
L:  Possibly.  I don't know.
R:  I can't think of the name of the island but it's right outside of Oregon and Washington.
L:  Mm.
R:  And, um, I know that there's a lot of tourists there to watch the -- the whales coming through there.  And I guess they have killer whales or something.  Some --
L:  Could be.
R:  -- really big whales that come through there.  So, it could be there, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really cool.  Um, I
