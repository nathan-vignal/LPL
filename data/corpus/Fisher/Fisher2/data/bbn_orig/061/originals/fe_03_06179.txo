R:  Hi, I'm Vanessa.
L:  Vanessa?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm Michele, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good thanks.
R:  So, um, the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- topic is current events?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, I have to say I get most of my c- news from the radio, I listen mostly to NPR and sometimes to the BBC.
L:  Okay.  Um, I actually get The New York Times every day, um, Monday through Friday, but I don't really get to read the whole paper, so yeah, so, um, [LIPSMACK] the Internet, um, CNN dot com and once in a while through the radio, it depends.  I actually listen to the French news actually every morning and so that gives me a bit of a different perspective of what's going on.
R:  I used to listen to the French news.  Where I live right now I can't get it but -- but I --
L:  Where do you live?
R:  Oh, I live in Massachusetts and when I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- lived in New Jersey for a summer and I listened to the French news every -- every day and it was fabulous.
L:  [MN] But where -- where in Massachusetts do you live?
R:  Oh, in Amherst actually.
L:  Oh, Amherst, okay, yeah.  I'm in Boston actually.
R:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I was gonna ask you if you get The New York Times if it comes, um, timely?  I didn't know where you were so I was wondering if it came --
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I -- like, when I was in Denver it was silly to get The New York Times because it was already late by the time it got there.
L:  Oh.  I get it, um, yeah, I mean, b- it's there by six o'clock in the morning.
R:  Wow, that's amazing.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, and I get -- I'm a student so it's r- -- it's really cheap, eight dollars a month.
R:  Oh, I should check into that.  I've never -- I've never, it -- the other problem with the newspaper, as you said, is it's hard to get time to read the entire thing.
L:  It is.  It's really, um, [LIPSMACK] i- it -- for me it's, yeah, especially when you're a student there are times when you're like, oh, in the morning if you have some time you're basically just, you know, just catching up -- up on some other type of reading for school.  But --
R:  And then the other thing is that The Times has so mu- -- so many good articles in it that it's --
L:  Yeah, it -- it does.
R:  -- it's really hard [LAUGH] to get through them all.
L:  It is.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I try to just at least read the front page and the editorials.  And then, depending on the day of the week, there are like, Tuesday has the science section so I like to read that.
R:  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  And then Wednesday has the dining section [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:  -- which I just like to read, you know and go --
R:  So, uh, how come you don't get The Boston Globe?
L:  I much like The New York Times better.
R:  Mm.  How come?
L:  Um, it's, huh, it's more informed, it's, huh, it's got a broader range of news and, um, I don't particularly care about what's exactly going on specifically in the Boston, so this is The New York Times, it just gives you a little bit more of, uh, what's going on.
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  It's b- -- it's better written too, I think, and --
R:  We don't get The Boston Globe either.  Actually, right now we don't get any newspapers.
L:  Really?
R:  I can't -- I can't bring myself to commit to a newspaper.  For a while I got The Christian Science Monitor because it had really good, um, international news.  It was --
L:  We have never seen -- I've nev- -- I -- I live from like, right across the street from the Christian Science Center pra- practically, but I've never read a Christian Science Monitor.
R:  The paper, it's actually -- they have one religion article in there, and it's well labeled so you can avoid it if you want to, but all the rest of the news, it's like, international s- news.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it's known for being unbiased, and the coverage is usually really good, it's -- the articles are longer than typical news stories --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they cover things that you don't normally hear about on the -- in the normal media.  And I thought it was -- when -- when I was getting that one I thought it was really the best paper I had ever read.
L:  And is it a daily paper or weekly?
R:  I think it's daily.
L:  Daily?
R:  It's either daily or weekly.  I'm pretty sure it's daily.  And it's not -- it's a little bit m- -- the -- the problem with it is that it's a little bit more expensive but, um, and also I can't commit to reading a newspaper so --
L:  I know! [LAUGH]
R:  -- I haven't read one in a long time but it was -- that was the best newspaper, I love that newspaper.
L:  That's great.  That's good to know, I'll ch- have to check it out.
R:  It's also good because we -- we get so little international news here that it's really nice to see --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- something! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess!
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I also get, uh, Time Magazine, um, weekly and this year I just got as a gift a subscription to The Economist, which is amazing.
R:  Oh, that's a great magazine.
L:  It is so amazing.
R:  Yeah, my parents get The Economist and when I'm +ever -- whenever I'm there I read theirs.
L:  It --
R:  It's really nice.  Yeah, that's a great --
L:  It's got really interesting articles and --
R:  The other one that I like that's kind of light reading is Harpers.
L:  I've never s- read that one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's pretty good, they have a lot of, um, funny things in there that are good.  And then every so often they do -- I guess every issue they do it -- some kind of actual journalistic piece, but I -- I think it's a pretty good magazine also.  But, yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I -- the -- the TV media, I feel like it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- more or less useless! [LAUGH]  Even -- I don't even bother anymore because it just -- it just feels like -- w- I don't feel like I can trust it and --
L:  Yeah.  I never -- I mean, I hardly ever think of, "Oh, I should go and watch the news" it's never --
R:  Yeah.  And it feels like whatever you see on the news it's -- [MN] to me, I don't know if it's my paranoia or what but it feels like it's been filtered and censored.
L:  Yeah, but it's -- pr- probably.  I mean, I never -- I guess the only type of news I watch on TV is just local news because I got [several inaudible words] things that, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, any source of information for what's going on here, but even that's not even really news.
R:  Yeah.  We get, um, out here we get Connecticut's news and Connecticut's news is pretty scary!  It's like [LAUGH] every night there's like, ten murders and all --
L:  Exactly.  Or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, car crashes on the street and --
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're like, "Okay, that's not really news". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But it's so funny because I was -- during the war coverage also, um, I mean, I don't have cable or anything like that but I h- -- I have access to this French channel, TV channel, and TV news.  And it was really interesting, I could switch back and forth, um, as [inaudible] of the war, you know, the French coverage and the American coverage --
R:  Yeah, I bet that was interesting.
L:  -- what a difference.
R:  I wish that I could've seen that.  We haven't seen any French news in a long time.
L:  It was really, really, really interesting.
R:  Uh, even the BBC -- uh, even the BBC was interesting, to just hear -- to hear a different perspective or the other one that's really good is the Canadian broadcasting.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, to hear both of them, especially for the war coverage, it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was fascinating.  I always -- I liked that because we get a very singular view of things from here.
L:  It is.
R:  And when you can hear -- the French news would've been especially nice, I wish that we could've -- what did they -- what did they say?
L:  Well, I remember the one, um, [LIPSMACK] I think that it was right when, um, they went into Baghdad and they toppled down the statue and then so you -- you have the American media, you can see, you know, everybody cheering and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, gare- --
R:  And there are actually more like fifty people [LAUGH] --
L:  And then, I mean, I switched at the moment right to the French news and you saw the opposite like, you know, uh, "Americans are bad, uh, this is bad, this is terrible" you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- all the [inaudible].  It was right -- it was like, the same time where you just, you know, pro- they probably shot a different group of people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  The -- the thing that I noticed about that coverage, even the -- in the American news, they sorta downplayed that but, um, in that -- that particular square what you saw was some American soldiers pulling down the statue --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and about a hundred people crowded around them.
L:  Right.
R:  And then the rest of the entire -- if you look behind -- that famous picture -- if you look behind the first layer of people, the streets are completely empty and there's nobody else out and I -- I think that was really telling 'cause it -- it r- -- that really said --
L:  Right.  I- if there was --
R:  -- that there really were about a hundred people there and that was it.
L:  Right, exactly.  If there was much more, uh, supported then a lot more people would've been out there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  So that's interesting.  Well, yeah, it's a shame we don't get -- I -- I wish that we got a broader range of coverage here, I wish that we got more international perspective.
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure, I mean, I've never been to Amherst but, uh, what's the biggest city you're closest to?
R:  Well, I guess I -- we're about an hour and a half from Boston or maybe --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- forty -- forty five minutes from Hartford.  So -- and it's a -- it's a funny area, it's kind of a liberal utopia and everything is very left wing here.
L:  Really?
R:  And, um, so I guess I'm -- I'm kind of surprised -- I mean, Amherst can't really create a news organization of its own.  It's not like, you know, New York or someplace but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm -- I guess I'm [MN] I would like to see the United States in general getting more international perspective.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, only the [several inaudible words] very hard because in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, this country's so big and people -- most -- well, I'm not -- you know, [SIGH] it's just like, you're living in Boston and seeing all these anti war demonstrations and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I was always [inaudible] surrounded by people who were anti war but, you know, you just leave these liberal cities like that and people were pro war and have a completely different view, and I think --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that --
R:  That was always surprising.  You know, I had a -- a friend of mine, um, came to visit from Switzerland in the fall and she was -- I was telling her that -- that Americans are actually not pro war.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she was like, "No, it's just where you are".  And I said --
L:  Well --
R:  -- "No, it's not, it's -- it's not, it's actually [MN] Americans as a whole are not pro war but, you know, it just -- there's -- it's just that -- that people are stratified and -- and in a lot of -- most of the country they don't -- they're not terribly well informed and they don't  --"
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  "-- [MN] take any stance at all".  So --
L:  Yeah.  It's true, I had a friend, um, from Spain and she was afraid to come here because she thought everybody was pro war.  I said, "No! --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- Where are you getting your infor- --"  I said, "Where are you getting your information?"
R:  Well, I think -- I think -- I -- I kind of think that the American media sort of, um -- I -- I noticed during the demonstrations that it seemed like there was very little coverage of the demonstrations as, you know, [MN] in -- in a positive way.  There was coverage of the demonstration but they sort of minimized it, like they would -- they just wouldn't -- they wouldn't -- it seemed like they were sort of minimizing the entire anti war movement --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- in a -- in a certain way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I think that a broad, um, Americans were inclined to project themselves as unified for the action that the government was taking, which is -- which is kind of a shame because I think it -- it really did give people the wrong impression.  Um, but on the other hand, you know, given that -- [SIGH] given that it was a decision that was made sort of without considering --
L:  Yeah, without the American --
R:  Without American -- without American input sort of.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, maybe there was no choice but to say, "Okay, well, we're doing this thing, we're behind it".  I don't know.  Rather than present a divided front.
