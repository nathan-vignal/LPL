R:  Hi.  I'm Sharon from Massachusetts.
L:  Hi.  I'm Patty from Rhode Island.
R:  Hi, Patty.  What part of Rhode Island are you from?
L:  Hope.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, Chicopee.  It's Western Mass, right outside of Springfield.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, would you like to start?
L:  Sure.  I've never done this before, so --
R:  No, me neither.
L:  Okay, so what are we supposed to do?
R:  Um, apparently discuss, um, how we get our news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  About current events.
L:  Okay.  I usually read the newspaper every day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How about yourself?  
R:  [SIGH] Um, I only get the Sunday paper.  We don't get a daily. 
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] So, do you watch it [NOISE] on the TV?
R:  Um, yeah, I -- I watch the evening news or I generally get a lot of my information off the internet lately.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, when -- I've got AOL --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when I log in it's got the news page.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I just click around until I find something; an article or two to read and then I'll -- I'll read that. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, [MN] we watch CNN as we're clicking by, you know, on the -- on the TV.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's usually about it; television and internet would be the most for me.  How about you?
L:  I think mainly the newspaper and then my son watches the CNN headline news all the time so that is on a lot in the morning --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- before anybody gets up and that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  He'll fill me in on a lot of things. 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And we sit down and watch it sometimes together but not too much.  Mostly the newspaper after the kids are off to school.
R:  Mhm, when you can sit and relax.
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm, definitely.  Um, I find I'm so overloaded though with information, don't you?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I tend not to have the local news on because it's just inundated --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with bad things all the time and I tend not to have that on because that's dinnertime and getting ready for dinner and I don't -- I have a daughter that's eleven and I think that there's just so much that sometimes it's overwhelming to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I try not to have it all on.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.  It's scary for them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's -- it's tough having to explain to them all that's going on in a [SIGH] manner that they can understand without scaring them.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] Lately we've been having lots of little local things going on like accidents and fires and bank rob- -- you know, [MN] store robberies and that kind of thing and it's -- it's just -- it's too much.  My daughter's seven and when the news is on I don't even like to have her in the room.
L:  It is tough.  That's very tough.  We have a lot of the, um, [LIPSMACK] the station night club fire.
R:  Mm, oh, yeah.
L:  So, if you're familiar with that -- that's right down the street from where we live.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And it's a, you know, it's a road that we pass quite frequently and in the beginning you c- -- you had to change your driving patterns because you couldn't go past it and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it's all new and, um, there was just -- even in the newspapers my son would read the paper -- he's fourteen but, um, it just -- every day it was a story about devastation and families and what they're going through and just -- just horrible, horrible stories and, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  I think life is tough enough and to not have the kids have to listen to it all the time. [inaudible] --
R:  No, c- --
L:  -- have to look at it.
R:  Most probably people that they know directly, or indirectly through school or some- -- [MN] somehow who have lost family members in that fire too.
L:  [SIGH] Um, yeah, they -- I don't -- we don't know of anybody personally.  Just, uh, I think it's your typical small state where a friend of a friend lost somebody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  One of those things.  So, it's like you said, indirectly you know of somebody.  But, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Argh, that was awful.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  I couldn't believe it.
L:  It's still going.  I think -- I think there's a couple of people -- I think they went up to Mass General too, some of the people that were hurt.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's right because the emergency rooms were inundated.
L:  Right, and they also there -- I don't know if there still are people but, um, they went to, oh, I -- I think Worcester.  Is there -- is a big hospital near Worcester?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm not sure what hospital it was but they did go up there too.  They went everywhere; Connecticut, Mass --
R:  Mm.
L:  Some here.  It was unbelievable.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's a national tragedy.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah, it was incredible.  But they ha- -- I think now they, you know, with -- with everything in the news it's not -- it's not even -- if you turn it off it's -- when you listen to the radio and they, you know, have breaking stories all the time or they have different things in school where they have to rethink, um, their safety things as far as the war also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't just have fire drills any more.  It's, um, evacuation plans and, um, lockdown scenarios and --
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, even --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- though they're not watching the news and thinking about the war as much having it, you know, right in your face, um, they have to deal with it on a daily basis in school where; "Which kind of a drill is it?  Is it going to be -- is -- are we going to war?  Is somebody invading our school or is it a fire?"
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  All these different things.  It's not, um, I guess it's not for when we were in school where you just had a fire drill and were thrilled that you got to go outside.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I remember.  Oh, gosh.
L:  [SIGH] Long time ago.
R:  It's true we -- um, we're right near Westover Air Force Base.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so [MN] -- and my daughter's school is right outside the gate.  So, they have a lot more drills too and she -- being a seven year old they -- they don't really -- still don't understand a lot of what's going on and it just gives a general feeling of anxiety and I know she worries and she -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  She doesn't articulate it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and -- and it shows up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in other ways and it's -- that's very troublesome.
L:  Right.  Is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that your only child?
R:  No, we have, uh, two -- we have twin boys.  They're a year old.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, they're, uh, they're oblivious right now.
L:  That's -- I guess not such a bad thing.
R:  No, that's for sure.  Ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- it's really, uh, it's overwhelming to the little kids.  
L:  Right.
R:  My mother used to, um, [LIPSMACK] tell us about how in the fifties when she was in school they would dil- -- do these drills remember for nuclear testing?  You would put your head between your knees or you'd get down under your desk.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Which was total- -- you know, just totally futile if there was ever a -- an attack but --
L:  Right.
R:  It gave them something to focus on, I guess.
L:  Right, but I think back then they thought they knew what they were doing too.
R:  Yeah, that's for sure.  Boy, we've, uh, we've had our eyes opened.
L:  Yeah.  I know the kids, you know, they do hear the things on the news and they do think, um, "Do we need to buy the duck tape or don't we?"  And they learn different things in school 'cause, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [SIGH] I went to Costco[?] and [LAUGH] right around the time when they were saying, "Go out, you know, buy duck tape, buy the plastic sheets", and low and behold a big skid[?] full of the, um, big giant rolls of plastic stuff and the duck tape too.  So, Costco was ready to supply all your needs [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- for emergency situations.  We had to laugh.  It was just so funny to see. [SIGH] You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- taking advantage of the every opportunity.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Argh.
L:  But I think probably back -- way back when -- when you were talking about when your mother was in school that they probably would have thought the duck tape was a great idea.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you -- I mean, you really think about it the gas is gonna get in even if your duck tape is, you know, you windows are duck taped.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It doesn't matter it's gonna seep in somewhere.
R:  No, that's for sure. [SIGH] I -- I thought of doing it.  I thought of -- well, not -- not taping them up but having it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ready just in case.
L:  Right.
R:  But, I don't know, it seems kind of pointless because how long could you last inside your house anyway?  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know, say you were able to protect yourself somewhat. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I wonder if, um, how long it would stay in the air outside anyway.
L:  It's true.  It's very true.
R:  But hopefully we won't have to worry too much about it. [SIGH]
L:  I'm hoping not.  I'm hoping this is the end.  That we don't go to war with anybody else.
R:  Oh, it's awful and now they're talking about North Korea.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I don't -- I don't understand all of it.
R:  No, I don't ei- --
L:  You read some of it and you -- you don't understand it.  Even though we look for a new- -- a news source you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You hear it on the news and they say one thing.  You read it in the paper it's another thing and they have just the small blurbs on the internet and then what do you believe?
R:  Mm. [SIGH] 
L:  I guess we have too much information I think.
R:  I do too.  I agree. [SIGH] Um, it seems like the media enjoys it.  You know, it gives them an excuse --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to be on all the time.
L:  [SIGH] Right.  It's a lot of hype too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it scares us more than anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Th- that's what I found.  While when we first initially went to war I said, "I don't -- I don't even want to read the paper.  I don't wanna see it happen.  I don't, you know, I'm not happy".  I'm sure there's nobody that is thrilled that we're in war but it just -- I didn't -- just kind of -- kind of boycotting the paper.  Just saying, "I don't wanna read this.  I don't wanna know about these poor American soldiers that have been killed".
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, it's just -- it's a tough thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and everybody thinks that it's over now but, uh, it's not.
R:  No.
L:  You know, they're still there.  There's a lot of people that are still there and they're gonna be there for a long time.
R:  Oh, it could end up being like Vietnam.
L:  Oh, I hope not.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, me too.
L:  I hope not.
R:  It's just so -- [SIGH] it's such a drag on everyone too.  You know, [MN] lives are lost [MN].  It's so expe-
