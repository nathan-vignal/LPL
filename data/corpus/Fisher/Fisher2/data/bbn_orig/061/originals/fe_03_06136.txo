R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Hi, I'm Robin.
L:  Hi, I'm Carey.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Carey.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi!
R:  [SIGH]  How do I ah, ... [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, what a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lame topic, huh?  Um ...
R:  [NOISE]  Well, it's not funny when they give you the first -- the first little choice, [SIGH] you know, when they ask you if you want to take the call.  It's like, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- current events, it's like, [MN] "Well, that's a buzz".  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It's like -- like reviewing everything I've heard in the l- last two --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- days, [LAUGH] you know.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Um --
L:  I think I get ... most of mine from either [SIGH] my mother calling me if it's a big deal.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or, um, [MN] I always look at MSN dot com [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- every day and see if there's anything on there, and there usually [SIGH] isn't.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, I know [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I mean, [SIGH] um, usually let's see.  [SIGH]  I -- mine are usually peekers[?].  Ah, Yahoo comes up as my [SIGH] main browser --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as my home page [SIGH] and I get my [LAUGH] five pieces of headline [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- help from the national news.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  And I think I look at 'em.  I very rarely click 'em [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because [SIGH] it's like well, [SIGH] as long as they said Denver isn't blowing up [SIGH] I [LAUGH] you know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I really don't [LAUGH] -- it really doesn't matter to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  Um --
L:  I don't think it's healthy to [SIGH] read too much.  [SIGH]
R:  No, except when we did have the war I had -- I did have ... TV on constantly.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, and my husband refused --
L:  I feel --
R:  -- [SIGH] refused to watch it so I had to [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to move it into the room with my computer.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I have little -- little kids so I tried --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- not to have it on too much [SIGH] 'cause --
R:  Yeah, def- definitely.
L:  -- they don't [SIGH] understand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My -- in fact my son asked me yesterday [SIGH] um, why God made bad people.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]  And I said that God didn't make --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bad people there's just people that are [SIGH] sick and they're sick in their mind, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they can't help it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I didn't know how else to answer it.  There's no such thing as bad people.  [SIGH]
R:  No, they're --
L:  They're just people that are --
R:  -- just make bad choices.
L:  -- [NOISE] right, that ... [SIGH]
R:  How old is your -- your son?
L:  Um, four.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, he's pret- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's a little too young to go with the whole choice and the ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  No, I just told him they were sick and their sickness was in their brain.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Hm.
L:  [MN]  I usually watch -- we have, um, [SIGH] -- our local news comes on at five --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and I do [SIGH] sometimes [SIGH] if I have the TV on I'll -- I'll [SIGH] watch part of it if I hear something that [SIGH] sparks my interest or if I was watching Oprah and heard a preview of something that [SIGH] I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] plan to watch.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  We also have, -- um, [LIPSMACK] where I live we have [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] -- I guess it'd be like weather radios but they're [SIGH] for more than weather [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we have 'em in each of our houses.  [SIGH]
R:  Huh!
L:  And they'll come on if there's [SIGH] something I- important.  [SIGH]
R:  You mean like the --
L:  They'll come on and start playing.  [SIGH]
R:  That's like your -- your town does that, or your city?  Or --
L:  Um, well, we're near a ... chemical depot.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  So, that's who paid for 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cool, though.
L:  But -- yeah, the Federal Government provided them.  [SIGH]
R:  Hm.  [MN]
L:  So, once in a while I -- I hear about thunderstorms [SIGH] coming or something on that.
R:  Oh, you're a fibber.  You don't want to hear your -- you don't want to hear anything over that [LAUGH] though.
L:  All I've ever heard is weather reports.  [SIGH]  And you --
R:  Like if that's true --
L:  -- can turn it on and listen to it any time you want [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and listen to the weather.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  But the only time we've had it come on its own [SIGH] is for weather.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  --
R:  That's good.
L:  [SIGH]  And you already know if there's going to be a thunderstorm --
R:  [NOISE]  Well --
L:  -- usually or you've heard it [SIGH] --
R:  -- that's true, huh.
L:  -- or flooding.
R:  I guess like I -- I hear about a lot of news, ah, from people I know ... on line.
L:  Right.
R:  I get my different news groups see and people say, " [SIGH] Oh, my God turn --"
L:  Yeah, there's that too.
R:  "--turn the TV on" or you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  And you have no clue where they are and [LAUGH] when they wrote that  email you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, sometimes they -- they -- ah, what --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you get there is stuff that [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- sometimes things make national news that aren't national news and then you hear something on line and you're like, "Wow!"  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, --
R:  It's something you would thing would be important maybe and [SIGH] --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  Exactly.  So, I --
R:  I know it's a -- [SIGH] -- hm.
L:  I think it's very, um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're told what they want to tell us kind of thing.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, definitely, I mean --
L:  It's like we had a prisoner escape [SIGH] last week and nobody heard about it for days.  I did 'cause I work at the prison, but --
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a different prison.
R:  Right but you -- yeah -- but --
L:  That was a big huge [SIGH] event going on at the park that -- he escaped on Thursday and there was a big event going on there that weekend [SIGH] --
R:  Hm!
L:  -- and nobody even knew.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, --
L:  And I -- that's just crazy.  [SIGH]  And I was there [SIGH] when they called our prison and said call all the hos- -- not the hospitals the [SIGH] TV and radio, whatever, and announce it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And she called 'em.  I heard her call 'em and they still didn't do it.  [SIGH]
R:  Huh.  [NOISE]  That's --
L:  So, I can't figure out why.  I mean that's newsworthy, why wouldn't they want to [SIGH] --
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean if -- you know, everybody should -- you think would have been fighting to be the first ones to announce it too, you know.
L:  Yeah, you'd think but nobody heard about it until after the weekend.
R:  Oh!
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well ...
L:  So, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  -- what the deal was there [SIGH] but --
R:  [LAUGH]  I know and --
L:  -- he's still out.  They haven't caught him yet.  [SIGH]
R:  Huh!
L:  He was -- he was cleaning --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- up a state park so he --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- wasn't too high security but --
R:  Oh, okay since I --
L:  -- he was still in prison for stalking [SIGH] and --
R:  Oh!  Yeah.
L:  -- something else.
R:  [SIGH]  I know that's a [LAUGH] sort of -- you work in a prison.  [SIGH]  I -- I went to the county jail once for a ... tour and that was enough for me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, just a tour?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] in fact I did it twice because of the -- the class [LAUGH] that once I was in and then once I led --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and it was like, [SIGH] we had a different -- different, ah, county sheriff down here, different policies, like, the second -- the new one [SIGH] didn't let us go ... see the prisoners which I was glad --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] 'cause, um, I don't -- I don't like either --
L:  I took a g- group --
R:  -- of us feeling like z- zoo animals.
L:  -- of high school kids in the jail [SIGH] and I was very disturbed because they let a prisoner walk right by my students.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They let, um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- one -- some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the prisoners were talking in Spanish to -- to my kids.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, gee!
L:  And the guard -- the officer didn't speak Spanish and ... I don't either.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, it kind of freaked me out.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- then I found out later that a couple of my students were high.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  And I thought, "What an idiot [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- get high to go to a ... visit a jail".  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I could --
L:  I don't know, but --
R:  -- I was glad to l- leave those [LAUGH] that way.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- well I -- I had a little different [SIGH] um, view on it because I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a teacher so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I'm not a officer and [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's -- it's very --
R:  Huh!
L:  -- different to be in there as someone that's [SIGH] trying to h- help them be better people than [SIGH] someone there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to discipline.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, ...
R:  And I didn't real- -- in -- in terms of our ... jail here it's a [SIGH] well, you know, the county facility so it's -- you know, they don't stay long they're [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And last year when we actually -- we did get to talk to one of the g- guys and he was like in the minimalist of ... security.
L:  Hm.  Hm.
R:  In fact I think that they run a job release and stuff.  [SIGH]  And he talked to us and told us what he was doing -- you know.  It was real neat, he went round your tables.  [SIGH]  You know [SIGH] something neat but [SIGH] ...
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's kind -- if you talk to them --
R:  But I don't know, you know,  you just --
L:  -- they're interesting people that's for sure.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, well and he was you know, --
L:  And t- to hear their political views [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- now there's some serious entertainment.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sure.  [LAUGH]  But --
L:  To hear what they think of ... what's important in our --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- society --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and in the news and what's going on.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's just -- it's -- it blows your mind.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because their -- their world is so warped.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  What's important.
R:  Well, I can see being locked up would work a lot too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even -- yeah, I mean but I'm sure there's some warpage[?] beforehand too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [SIGH] I wonder how --
L:  I don't get the newspaper here because [SIGH] it's -- I -- I don't know, it's more or less worthless.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  And I live in a small town and we have -- our newspaper only comes out twice  a week but the next town over [SIGH] is a daily one and that's the one most people get.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's kind of too concentrated to have two papers.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now a third one just started up from the --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- next town the other way.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, gee!
L:  So, we have three daily papers here [SIGH] and they're all worthless.  [SIGH]
R:  And they all probably talk about --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all the high school football.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, and I really miss my -- the town I grew up in we had a great newspaper.  I didn't think so at the time but I do now.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- I really miss that, reading the -- the local news and [SIGH] -- but I am not going to ... spend my money on [SIGH] a paper --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where I can flip through all the pages and I find nothing I want to read.  [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  And I get --
L:  -- and I'm paying for it.  [SIGH]
R:  We get the Denver Post and I don't l- live in Denver --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so it's only peripheral you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean like there's a big mayor race and it's like [SIGH] "Oh, gee, you know, I [SIGH] -- I guess it does matter who's the mayor but, you know, [LAUGH] I can't --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- I can't influence [LAUGH] that stuff".
L:  And that kind of information you can get on line really.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  I guess I get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it for the coupons [SIGH] too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I do miss the coupons.  [LAUGH]
R:  The coupons and the ads on Sunday and t- the grocery ads --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on Wednesday [LAUGH] and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's about it.  [LAUGH]  And my husband said, "Well you know if we just get the weekend paper".  And, you know, he showed me how much it was cheaper.  [SIGH]
L:  But it's so expensive.  It isn't cheaper.
R:  Well, it isn't in a lot -- you know, that paper -- it's like only like one paper's worth cheaper, [LAUGH] -- you know.  [LAUGH]  I mean it --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- it wasn't cheap enough 'cause I said, "No, then I miss Wednesday".  So, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] it's not going to --
L:  Yeah, it's not worth it.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, so I said, "Well, just keep getting -- you know we stuck in the end with the whole.  I have got the whole year free --"
L: Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] so I'm not [LAUGH] complaining.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  [SIGH]  And -- but I -- you know, I like -- I like to get my news from a lot of different -- I mean I -- I've gotten just so that I don't trust anything I really read --
L:  Yeah, well --
R: --or hear in one place.
L:  -- I think the Internet's helped us with that too, we really saw --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how easy it is to make things up and ...  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, exactly.  [SIGH]  'Cause I bounce one source of, of another and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but -- well I guess sometimes I get news from my husband.  You know, he'll say, "What do you think about this?" [LAUGH] when --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he decides he want to ... talk at dinner, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, we don't have kids so, [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- you know, we're like [SIGH] some days we just eat and some days it's like, "What if we have conversation [LAUGH] --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- you know, where we discuss current events" [LAUGH] you know.  I almost feel like a kid, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I would -- I can't wait to have ... my children old enough that I can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- read newspapers and books --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and do things like that.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] well --
L:  Well that's another thing.  I just finished, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- college.
