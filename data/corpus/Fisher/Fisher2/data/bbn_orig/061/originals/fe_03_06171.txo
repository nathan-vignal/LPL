L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?  Hi, this is Irene.  [NOISE] Wh- who is this?
R:  My name is Suzanne.
L:  Hi, Suzanne.  Hm.  How are you?
R:  I'm good, how are you?
L:  I'm good thank you.
R:  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in New York City.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And where are you?
R:  I'm, uh, near Los Angeles.
L:  Oh wow --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- far away from me! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  We're on --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- different sides of the country.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  So, I guess we need to talk about current events.
L:  Current events.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I -- I have no idea what's going on in the world since the war started [LAUGH].
R:  Well --
L:  I -- I kinda stopped following the news. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so I guess like most of my information I get from my friends or, like, you know, sometimes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I take a subway a lot in the city and so I get to read the headlines of the newspapers that people are reading.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I get it from television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mostly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, either CNN or just the nightly news.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [COUGH] But I have a pretty good idea of what's going on.
L:  [NOISE] You do? [NOISE]
R:  I -- I think so, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, it's -- it's interesting, um, for me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, with the war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'd -- I don't think the Americans expected to win or take over the country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as quickly as it happened.  And so I think what we're seeing now is, um, the people of Iraq are getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, upset with the Americans because we're not able --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to implement programs and, you know, police officers and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all that stuff just right away.  They want it now and, you know, it takes time --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I think, to get that --
L:  Yeah, uh --
R:  -- in place, and so they're -- they're very p- frustrated with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I- it doesn't sound too good but, you know, [NOISE] I mean, you don't have to be like, um, scholar to figure out that it would probably have some kind of negative repercussions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  On both --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- parties.
R:  It is --
L:  So --
R:  -- amazing how [COUGH], you know, the US always gets involved in things and when it's over we are the ones that look bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, you know, if you try to play the role of like a big brother [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or something like that of -- it's like, i- it's -- it's a very controversial thing.
R:  It is.
L:  It really is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's just too bad that people are dying and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so many people have such negative understanding of American -- Americans in general.  Like, you know, sometimes I talk to lots of friends who live in Europe or like, my parents live in Europe and, uh, like, so they've been telling me a lot about the European [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, opinions of America --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, you know, it's just too bad that they start thinking of America as us, like, you and I [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  And we -- we really have nothing to do with the politics and politicians and the decisions that were being made with --
R:  Yeah.  Well, the only thing --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- we can do is vote.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  [LIPSMACK] And --
L:  [NOISE] Sure.
R:  -- the -- the presidential thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- only comes around --
L:  [SIGH] [MN]
R:  -- once every four years.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you know, if you vote in a turkey --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, then you're gonna be stuck with a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- turkey for four years. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh God. [SIGH]
R:  But, um --
L:  Not that -- I don't think he'll get elected for another four years, what do you think?
R:  I don't.  Um, I think there's way too much, um, Bush bashing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going on, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's -- he seems to be taking the brunt of it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, you know, he's the problem, he's the, you know, reason that everything's the way it is, which I don't know how much of that is true. [COUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's really hard for us to tell because all the information we get, we get it from [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- from the media, which is being controlled by [NOISE] whatever it's being controlled by. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  It is interesting though, when you do watch the evening news, if you happen to flick back and forth --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so much of that information is the same on both or several channels.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  Um, so they're all getting fed the same stories at some point.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I guess so.
R:  You know?
L:  It's [MN] -- it's really not right.
R:  No, it isn't.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  There should be, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's -- there should be w- -- you know, one channel takes the chance --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN]
R:  -- and looks the other way on the common story and goes to, you know, the real things that are going on, I guess.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't know how to put it.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  I [MN] -- I know what you mean.  You know, the funniest thing I [inaudible] know when just -- when the war just started, I saw a newspaper that my boyfriend brought in the house and, uh, it had this picture of this girl who was kidnapped by Iraqi army or something like that, but yeah, and the whole story was presented in the form of a sitcom or something like that, you know, like a TV show --
R:  Mm [inaudible] --
L:  -- like Ricky Lake or some sort. [SIGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And I, you know, I opened it up and then I s- kind of skimmed through the paper and like, everything concerning the war was presented in this manner and I was just shocked and then I told him, "You know, we should save this newspaper because I think twenty years from now it will be like, a piece of art, like a museum kinda thing".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] It just seems unreal.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely unreal. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]
R:  I'll bet if we were to compare say the New York Times to the LA Times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think we would see a lot of similarities.
L:  Yeah, probably.
R:  In the -- in the way that they're written --
L:  Probably.
R:  -- and the way that, you know, they m- quote unquote manipulate us.
L:  Well, LA Times --
R:  You know?
L:  -- is like, one of the major LA papers, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kinda al- alternative papers you guys have there?
R:  Oh. [SIGH]  Alternative.  I don't know.
L:  Like, for example, like in New York you can pick up papers for free, like, Village Voice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or like, New York Press and some -- some of them have [NOISE] like, pretty different views.
R:  Different views.
L:  Yeah, and they just --
R:  Um --
L:  -- say --
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know, I'm not aware of any.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know we have them around here but they're not, um, I think as well regarded as the ones that you mentioned.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, even I know those, the Village Voice.
L:  Mhm.  Mm.
R:  You know.
L:  Are good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I know about that.  Um [SIGH], but, um, th- to my knowledge there isn't anything like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, out here.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  But that say I could, you know, name off a paper and you would recognize the name. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] And how about the TV?  Do you have like, independent chan- -- like, city channels or it's all pretty much commercial?
R:  Um, we've got everything because we have satellite.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- So we can kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pull in a lotta different, um, [LIPSMACK] areas and a lotta different opinions.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Which is good.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and I'm one of the -- because I am very sceptical -- when -- when I hear something come out of, say, the Whitehouse and it's termed a certain way I tend to try and twist it and see if it could mean something else.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And sometimes it's come to pass that it, you know, what I was thinking was correct.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now I hear they're advertising the New York Times on your TV!
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  It's -- it's like the most ridiculous thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I cannot stand it, especially the people they chose for those commercials.
R:  Oh really?
L:  They don't even look real to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] I mean, they look like people -- like some executive from the offices but I guess 'cause I don't really encounter those [LAUGH] too many times --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in a day. [NOISE]  Yeah, that's really [LIPSMACK] different.  [LAUGH] Different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like, as I said, most of my information I get from people around me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  From friends [NOISE], from people on the subway, you know, when people have to spend time on the public transportation so they start talking between th- each other.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] So you pick up lots of facts and lots of different attitudes.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  And you have a broad, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- base of, um --
L:  But I would say --
R:  -- now- nowadays.
L:  -- like, yeah, the -- like, you know, pretty much everybody in New York that I've spoken to or I've heard of, they feel like we should not have invol- -- have gotten ourselves involved in this war and, uh [NOISE], they are -- pretty much all of them they are anti Bush --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- administration.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it --
R:  I hear a lot of that.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But then, you know, I was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a person that couldn't stand Clinton.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, you couldn't stand him?
R:  Oh!
L:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
R:  He could've fallen off the earth and I wouldn't have minded.
L:  [SIGH] Really?  Oh --
R:  [MN]
L:  --  that's funny 'cause I liked him.
R:  Oh, I -- you know --
L:  I mean, you know, it's -- it's --
R:  -- once you have that indiscretion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay, I don't forgive.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I just -- I think there's a time and a place for everything and he's
