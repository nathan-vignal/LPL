R:  No, you're right, it's true, everything that's going on.
L:  Exactly.  And you could put on the TV and you could hear that they are like, you know, just like, doing like, drills --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- for like, chemical d- things going on and -- and you could actually get a little worried there. [LAUGH]  You know?  'Cause they [inaudible] -- they're all types of drills now.
