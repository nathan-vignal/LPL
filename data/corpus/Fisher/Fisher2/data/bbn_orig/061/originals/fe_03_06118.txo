L:  Hi, it -- my name is Heidi.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Heidi, my name is Anne.
L:  Hi, Anne.
R:  How are ya?
L:  Good thanks.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  Where you calling from?
L:  Michigan.
R:  Oh, I'm in Illinois.
L:  Oh, you're not that far away.
R:  [LAUGH] Not that[?] yet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, how do you keep track of current events?  This is kind --
L:  Um --
R:  -- of neat talking to strangers on the phone.
L:  Yeah, actually it is.  We -- I -- I belong to a refund page and we talk about this almost every day.  So, yeah, it is.  Um, I don't watch a lot of TV.  We try to stay away from the TV and especially with summer coming.  Um --
R:  Oh, you're a good girl.
L:  Yeah, but you know, 'cause it seems like every time you listen to the news it's always bad and -- and, um, it's just, you know, really who needs all that? [LAUGH] 
R:  I totally agree.
L:  So --
R:  I -- I don't read a newspaper any more because of that.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
R:  I kind of, you know, what I hear from people or I'd have to say on the radio.  I listen to the radio.
L:  Right.  My mom, um, calls me and says, you know, "Did you hear?"  And I'm like, "No, you know, I don't really watch television".  And she's like " [SIGH] Well, you really should turn on your television because you're missing all this".  And you know I did -- I have to say I did turn it on like when the war started, um, real briefly for the first day or two and after that I realized why I keep it off. [LAUGH] So m-, you know --
R:  Me too.  The same thing.
L:  So, I -- I do read the paper maybe -- maybe once a week but if, you know, if it's something that's gonna be depressing or bad I -- I try to skip over it.  Not that it doesn't involve me because it does involve everyone but, you know, there's just too many things going on that we don't need that bad influence in our life.  So --
R:  I know.  They don't have enough positive stuff in the news.
L:  No, absolutely not.  Absolutely not.
R:  My mom is smart.  She picks up the paper every morning.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Lives in New Mexico.  Whenever she comes here I have it delivered.
L:  Mhm.
R:  First thing she goes for is the comics.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The rest can wait. [LAUGH] I think --
L:  That's the way it should be.
R:  I think so too.  I think so --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- too.  But otherwise it is.  It's all depressing.
L:  Right, right.  You know, it's just with the economy and everything and it's just really -- I think we just need a lot more positive influences and -- and whether it be the eleven o'clock news, the five o'clock news, um, the daily paper; you know, talk shows, anything, it's always something negative.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's like [SIGH] you know what?  We -- we have enough events in our home town that happen daily and, you know, daily that are bad.  We don't need everything else.  So, [LIPSMACK] you know, I guess and if it -- if it's something that I need to know about, um, I have neighbors, I have friends, um, my boss will keep me informed [inaudible] but usually my mom will call and say, " [SIGH] Did you hear?" [LAUGH] So --
R:  That's true.  That's true.  Is your mom out of state too?
L:  No, she is about four hundred miles away.
R:  Oh, that -- but -- but she reads the newspaper?
L:  Oh, yeah.  And, you know, and she has a police scanner.  Oh, yeah, she's just like -- she's up and all.
R:  My husband's got that too, a police scanner.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, those are neat because then you get to hear what happens in your area.
L:  Right.
R:  And even though it's not good you kind of need to know that.
L:  Right, well I -- I moved.  I mean, she lives where I used to live and so she, you know, she keeps me up even on things that happen up there and if it -- you know, if it's important to me or if it should involve me then she would let me know so it keeps -- she's like my filter.
R:  So, your mom is your newspaper. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  That's good.
L:  She's a very good filter for me.  So 
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- too much depressing stuff.
L:  Yeah, really is.  I mean, there's so many people they lose their jobs and, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] um, up where I used to live it's a very small town and, you know, a lot of the big manufacturers are closing, stores are closing.  Um, you know, and g- gas prices are rising, you know, food prices are rising, all this stuff is happening and it's like the economy is -- is bad and I guess [SIGH], you know, take -- take your kids to the park and play baseball don't read the -- don't sit home and read the paper.
R:  That's right.
L:  You know.  Go -- go out and grow some hotdogs.
R:  And don't turn on the TV.
L:  Right, go grow some hotdogs and go play catch and   I mean, not that everything's gonna be honky dory just because you don't have the TV on, it's reality.  We all know what reality is, or most people do, I should say. [LAUGH] And, um --
R:  Right.
L:  You should just -- as long as you know where to separate it then I think you'll be okay without reading that.  So --
R:  Right.  I agree.  And usually you find out what you need to find out.
L:  Right, exactly.  I mean --
R:  Somehow or another.  I think most people listen to the radio too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they tell you in between the music whether you wanna hear it or not, you know.
L:  Right.  Right.  I -- I used to listen to a talk radio station a lot and, uh --
R:  Yeah, that's what I listen to.
L:  Do you?  Do -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you think of it?
R:  Um, i- it's all right.  Just kind of chatter to pass the time in the car.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I mean, I don't do it at home or anything but usually when I'm in the car I put the radio on.
L:  Yeah.  I do -- I do too or I used to and -- and, um, I guess ev- even the christian talk radio station that I used to listen to too exactly was -- was, you know, "This is what happened today" and, you know, they would kinda sound real -- kind of like almost morbid, you know, and -- "And we heard this today", and it's like " [SIGH] Wait a minute.  Y- you know, even you are a christian talk radio station.  Perk up a bit".
R:  Supposed to be uplifting. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that's it.
R:  That's not a very   Um, it's not -- this isn't a topic that you could talk to a lot abou- [LAUGH] --
L:  No, really.  I was -- I was like --
R:  -- you could talk a lot about.  I'm kind of running out of things to say here.
L:  I know I was like, "Should I take it?  Ah, this is my second phone call.  I'll take it".  You know, and because the first one was great and, um --
R:  Me too.  I thought the same thing.
L:  Really? [LAUGH]
R:  What was your first question?
L:  Um, the first one was, um, if you got paid a million dollars --
R:  Me too.
L:  Was it?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's strange, Heidi.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But it was and I was talking and I couldn't believe the eight minutes were up.
L:  Oh, I know and -- and finally, you know, the -- the lady stepped in and I was like, "Oh, wait a minute, we're still talking.  We still have a lot to say".  You know.
R:  I know.  Then it's almost hard to say goodbye.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  You have thirty seconds now.
L:  It's like, "Wait a minute, if you wanna finish just call me back". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Yeah, you could do that, give 'em your number or something like that.
L:  [LAUGH] But it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was, uh, it was really neat and I was glad that I signed up for it and -- and, uh --
R:  How did you hear about it?
L:  Through my refund page --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on the internet.
R:  Neat.
L:  Yeah, and, um --
R:  A cousin told me about it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And yeah it is interesting.  It's kind of fun to do.
L:  It is.  I don't talk on the phone a lot but -- and, uh, I'm pretty much home all the time so -- so, you know, gives me a little to -- gives me a little, um, [LIPSMACK] guess I'm a -- gosh I guess I'm a big home body now that I think about it.  No news, no TV, no radio, I don't go out much. [LAUGH]
R:  But you get it all from your mom, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, right.  You know, my husband --
R:  So, you're all set.  You're not deprived or anything.
L:  Right.  My husband listens to, you know, the talk radio station on the way home and he'll say too, you know, "Did you hear about this?" And I'm like, "No, don't need to.  Doesn't involve me.  Don't care".  So  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, or somebody's talking about it and you're going, "No, I didn't hear about it.  Fill me in".
L:  Yeah, I mean, you could -- you could hear about current events standing in line at the grocery store.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know you could get -- you could get an earful that way and -- and you might not like people's opinion that they voice but you know what the topic is and, you know, "I didn't hear about that but I heard -- I'm hearing about this now".  So, there's just many, many outlets to, uh, get your current events I think without the effect of the media.
R:  Without picking up a newspaper and getting depressed.
L:  Yep, and the media just doesn't really help.  They seem to thrive on negative things.
R:  Oh, they do because people like to read that.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  They're fascinated with the macabre and --
L:  Yep.  I mean, look at the -- the tabloids even.  You know, they're -- they're full of negativity and, um, they have record sales every week.
R:  Do you have other christian stations that are more up beat --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- or are they usually with the --
L:  Um --
R:  -- depressing news.
L:  We just moved to this -- to this area where I live now in September and we -- we just -- we were like on the verge of -- of not getting the station and that was the only one that I've ever listened to and, uh, [LIPSMACK] I guess I buy more CDs and -- and tapes and stuff and listen to 'em at home rather than turning on the radio.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so it's -- it's constant music and, um, and they have a lot of, um --
R:  Music is good for the soul they say.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  I'm a big music person too.  Even --
L:  No --
R:  -- if I'm cleaning or putzing around I put a tape on.
L:  Oh, you bet ya.  Depends on what you're in the mood for but, you know, hey whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gets the job done. [LAUGH]
R:  I agree.  I agree.  Well, I'm waiting for a thirty second warning, Heidi.
L:  I know.  I'm -- I was just looking at my phone and it said nine minutes and twenty one seconds, so [LAUGH] 
R:  Nine minutes and twenty one seconds your phone said?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But that's when they called.
R:  Oh, but -- but then they had to find you too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It was pretty quick.  I expected like to wait for ten minutes --
L:  I know.
R:  -- before they found a person.
L:  I know.  Before Tuesday they were like we had to wait and find somebody.  I'm like, "Oh, must be they called me first".
R:  Right.
L:  And I probably waited maybe -- maybe a minute this time.  I mean, click, you were right there.  And I was like, "Whoa".  That was --
R:  I thought the same thing.  I called this number and boom.
L:  Oh, you called the number first?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.  How did you get -- how did you get to do that first 'cause they've always called me.
R:  Oh, okay.  To call the number you dial eight six six --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Six eight seven four seven five eight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they'll ask you that stuff about your phone and your pin number and they'll get somebody on the line.
L:  Oh, so if you wanna call in you can whether they've waited for the --
R:  Yeah, you don't have to wait for them to call you.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.  Now, how many are you allowed?  Do you know?
R:  Three.
L:  Oh, and then the study is over?
R:  And the sooner you do the -- your three the +sooner you'll get your check.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, so I might just -- but it's only one day, probably.
R:  Every twenty four hours because it --
L:  Oh, it's not that I want to talk about this subject again anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  But if you call that number and give 'em your pin.  You have a pin and all that, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, then you could do your three and when you refer people give 'em your pin.
L:  Oh, no kidding?
R:  No, I just called 'em and I got a person instead of a machine that's why I knew.
L:  Oh, I didn't know.  I guess I didn't know that you could refer somebody with your pin too.  Huh.
R:  Oh, yeah, the more people that you refer, each time they do their three times then you get another dollar for 'em.
L:  [SIGH] No kidding.
R:  You didn't know this?  Heidi. [LAUGH]
L:  No, well I [LAUGH] -- I haven't re- --
R:  And [inaudible] with other project. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well I haven't referred anybody yet but I plan on -- there's like two or three so, hey, you know that's extra three dollars, what the heck, you know.
R:  Exa- -- as soon as they make their calls then you get the money.
L:  Oh, terrific.
R:  And, yeah, if you know a few, you know.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  It is -- to me it's fun.
R:  It's kind of fun to do.
