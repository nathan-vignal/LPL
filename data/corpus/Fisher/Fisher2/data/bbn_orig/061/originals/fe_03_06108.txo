R:  [NOISE]
L:  My name is Peggy.
R:  Hi, Peggy.  How are you?  My name is --
L:  Fine.
R:  My name is Peaches. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Peaches.
R:  It's a pleasure to meet you today. [NOISE] Yes --
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Yes, now who -- would you like to begin? [NOISE]
L:  It doesn't matter.
R:  Okay, I'll begin.  Is that okay? [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yes, I get all of my information -- well, most of -- the majority of my information through CNN, um, MSNBC, Six Ten, you know. [NOISE] And I'm starting to find out that everything that they say isn't really true so you have -- you can't just accept everything that you hear. [NOISE] You know?  You have to just --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- take the majority of it or parts.  Little bits and parts from each, you know, each tit bit of information that you get and different and sort of information and just keep clicking the TV, reading the newspaper, talking to people and getting opinions.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that's what I --
L:  I --
R:  -- do. [NOISE]
L:  M- most of the time I -- I try to watch, uh, the news or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or the news programs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, like Sixty Minutes and 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Twenty Twenty and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- Dateline and --
R:  Yes.
L:  Of course, uh, the nightly news and --
R:  Uh-huh, yes.
L:  Uh, the morning news program.
R:  Yes, very important -- and I know that the first three minutes of all the news is most important [NOISE] and the breaking news.  You know, like when they break through a special -- you know, with a special event with breaking news [NOISE] then you try to, you know, find out what's going on with that [NOISE].  So --
L:  Yeah, the most important stories, yeah, mhm.
R:  Y- yes, uh-huh.  And gossip.  You know, about the war you hear all kinds of stuff. [NOISE] You don't know whether to believe it, whether it's true. [NOISE]
L:  Well, uh, you know, uh, one thing I learned --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about, uh, watching the war news was that every place, every country had their own slant on things.
R:  Exactly.  Okay.
L:  They -- they were looking at from -- from, uh, their perspective of their culture.
R:  Exactly.  I realized that too.  I -- I -- you know, I didn't know that the -- you -- you -- where do you stay?  Where do you live?
L:  Uh, I live in Arkansas.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
L:  [inaudible].  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, everybody realizes that every country, every continent in the world, whether they translate it to English or not, [NOISE] they see things very differently than we do.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, it -- it's the culture, I imagine.  You know, because they're brought up differently than we are.
R:  Yes.
L:  And of course, uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Our country in itself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has its own unique culture, depending on where you live in the country.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Even here, that's right.  That's right, yeah.  Because I was watching, um, [LIPSMACK] about -- about, um, Saddam Hussein and +Osama Bin Laden --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And some people favored him [NOISE], some people didn't.  I simply grasp the information as much as I could.  I had no opinion.  You see, I had no opinion.  You know, after the broadcasting I simply know that nine eleven was terrible.  It was a tragedy and no face.  Nowhere in the world would con- -- would condone that type of behavior.
L:  No, I don't think so.  Uh, you know, that, uh, it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It -- it -- it's hard for me to understand --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- for the people over yon- -- over there in Iraq and Iran didn't -- and all that, you know, why they don't see it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the way that we do.
R:  Well, the whole --
L:  You know.
R:  -- world said it was a tragic but they don't understand.  They use a political thing -- a s- -- a religious thing [NOISE] for this type of behaviour.  I know of no religion that would tolerate that. [NOISE]
L:  No and even the religion that they supposedly profess --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- is against that sort of thing and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- yet they -- they twist it around to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, project their point of view.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And -- and I -- I -- that's, uh, that's just wrong.
R:  That's right.  That's right.  I also listen to the radio.  Do you listen to the talk show in that[?] city?
L:  Uh, some -- some of 'em.  Uh, you know, they're, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The radio -- the talk radio station here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Unfortunately has a Republican slant and so --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- a lot of it I don't agree with.
R:  Oh, okay, you --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- Democrat?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Me too.
L:  And --
R:  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, to -- a lot of the programs they have on the talk radio station here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- has more of a Republican slant.
R:  Yes.
L:  And it's -- uh, very little of it is -- is, uh, unbiased.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  And to me you can't get a -- an informed view if it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if it's a biased --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- talk show.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And you can't -- you can't get the truth.  You can only get, you know --
R:  Their o- --
L:  -- their political slant on it.
R:  Exactly, but you know what you can do?  You can call up and you can express yourself and let them know that.
L:  Well, I -- I have on occasion that, uh --
R:  Oh, okay. [NOISE]
L:  But most of the time, you know, uh, if -- if you're Democrat and they're Republican --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and you call in to tell 'em you think they're wrong, then they make it out like you're an idiot.
R:  Oh, okay, right --
L:  You know?
R:  It's a insult.  Yes, over injury[?]. 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yes, I do understand that.
L:  Yeah, they -- they make it -- they -- they make, uh, especially once they cut you off so you can't talk back to 'em.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Then they make their sh- -- their shoddy comments --
R:  Oh, okay, she -- yeah, yes.
L:  -- about, you know, so --
R:  Like, "She was an idiot.  What is she talking about?"
L:  So, I don't -- so I don't listen too much to the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- talk radio stations.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.
L:  Uh, because of that.  I wish that there was another one here, you know, that -- that was more unbiased --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- or at least -- at the very least, a Democratic one to -- to counter the -- the Republican w- --
R:  Exactly, yes.  Yes, yes. [NOISE] Well, I've listened to the one up here called WHAT --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's not a political -- it's simply a talk radio station.  The --
L:  It doesn't slant one way or the other?
R:  No, it do not.  Now -- now the people that run it they share their opinions but they allow you -- they do.  They allow you to share your opinions.  That way the listener audience can get a total view on other people's opinions.
L:  Well, that's the way it should be.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's the way it should be.  So, you're fortunate that you have that where you live.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  And it don't put a spin on it and they let you express yourself.  And I've --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- called up there around three times, you know.  I've --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- called there several times and I was able to +ask the question about it, you know, or give my opinion and you don't have to be smart or know a lot.  You simply call up with some dis- -- with some disagreements or agreements or opinions or you may need to know something.  It's a fully informational program.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, it's beautiful.  I wish you was up here just to hear it, you know, and there's several.  It's like ten. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I -- I wish, you know, somebody, uh, here, you know, would, uh, would start a radio station like that down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- here because I think a lot of people would like that.
R:  Yes, and there's about ten of 'em up here, you know.  And it -- and if -- and when I walk around the streets -- I'm gonna[?] talk about getting information from the people now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And when I walk around in the street and, you know, everybody has an opinion.  I don't knock the opinion.  I simply give my point of view, therefore's no argument, no disagreement.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  So, I may say, um, "Oh, man, I wish it wasn't a war.  You know, I sympathize with nine eleven and I simply don't wanna see more blood shed".  That's a fair cross statement.
L:  I don't wanna see anything like that again because, you know, I mean, like recently they're talking about the, uh, bombings going on in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Israel again.
R:  Yes.
L:  And -- and -- and, uh, then Israel retaliates.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and nothing can be accomplished by that.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And you know what?  I'm gonna[?] be honest.  I don't understand why Israel -- why the Israelis and the Iraqis -- why they -- why they can't get along.  I don't understand the Palestinians or the Iraq -- or the Israeli- Israelites.  I don't understand why they're fighting.  Do you --
L:  Well --
R:  -- understand it?  I don't know.
L:  Well, it -- yeah.  Well, it -- it all goes back to the time of Abraham.
R:  Yes.  But --
L:  A- Abraham's first son was, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, forgot what his name was.
R:  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay --
L:  Uh, b- but he -- he was the illegitimate son.
R:  It's Ishmael and -- and Isaac.  I- --
L:  He was the illegitimate son.
R:  Right, Ishmael and Isaac.
L:  And he was -- and he was sent away after Isaac was born.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  And -- and he -- he and his mother were sent away and, uh, made a home in the desert and that became the Middle Eastern countries --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- like Iraq and Iran and stuff like that and ever since then --
R:  Ever since.
L:  -- they've -- they've been at war with Israel.
R:  And can you believe -- I've got to +ask you this.  Can you believe two brothers this -- would have this type of things going on?  You understand what I'm saying?
L:  Well, it -- it -- it was a relationship born of hate.
R:  Yes, could --
L:  You know, beca- because, uh, the one that was cast out, you know, resented --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, his brother and -- and, you know, hate grows to resentment --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, jealousy and hate and nothing can come -- you know, good comes w- from that, so --
R:  And aren't these two people that the Israelis and the Palestinians -- aren't they related?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you understand what I mean?  Ain't the Jews and the Muslims related? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Why are they fighting?
L:  We're -- we're -- we're all related.
R:  Do you un- -- I know, but I'm just saying, do they
