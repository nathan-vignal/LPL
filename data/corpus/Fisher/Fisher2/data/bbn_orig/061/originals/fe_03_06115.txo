L:  Hi, my --
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm fine.  How about you?
R:  I'm good thank you.  This is Dominique and I'm calling from Michigan to talk to you --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- about, uh, what was it? [LAUGH]
L:  Current events. [LAUGH] My name's Pamela.  I'm c- -- and I'm calling from California.
R:  Hi, Talin.  How are you doing today?
L:  Um, I'm fine.  Actually it's Pamela.
R:  Oh, Pamela.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry. 
L:  It's okay.
R:  Hi, Pamela.
L:  Hi.
R:  Well, it's sad that the com- -- they wanted us to talk about how we keep abreast of current events?
L:  Right.  And then I guess, um, talking about current events themselves?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, would you like to go first?
L:  Um --
R:  What do you find most helpful for you to keep you informed with what's going on in today's society?
L:  Um, well, I listen to the radio --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I also watch a little bit of news, not too much and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we have the paper but I try to avoid that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's too depressing.
R:  I understand completely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I do.  Especially 'cause I'm calling from Michigan. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's right.  How's -- how's --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- everything there.  I mean, are y- --
R:  Oh, my god.  It's --
L:  Some of the current events; do you have all the hurric- -- or the --
R:  Well, [LAUGH] --
L:  -- tornadoes and everything, right?  No?
R:  Yes, but the hot topic of the -- the past week has been our Mayor of Detroit.
L:  Oh?
R:  Yes, I don't know what's going on with that man but it's just -- I don't know.  It's caused -- the newspaper had it -- Sunday newspaper "They +Mayoral Mess". [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-oh.  See I haven't heard about that.  I -- you know, obviously I'm over -- way over here in California.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it was just really interesting that things that's been going on here and, uh, basically I -- I don't really watch too much of the news, um, read too much in the newspaper and -- and catch a lot of the news because, you know, they start out with the most depressing --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, like you said, events but I keep up in touch with, um, the radio talk shows --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- majority of the time.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, yeah, so but what's going on with our Mayor here is that, uh, he fired the Deputy Chief of Police with no explanation but the --
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  -- obvious reason is that the Chief of Police was investigating accusations against the Mayor, Kwame --
L:  Oh.
R:  Kilpatrick, right?  And so he just outright [LAUGH] fired him and also exposed the informant who was also on the, uh, Chief -- the police force who told on him -- told --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on the Mayor.  So, it's --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- just a really big mess going on down here. [LAUGH] Allegations of a house party that he had in the Mayor's mansion and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-oh, some naughty stuff that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he's been into.
R:  Yes.  Nude dancers at the party and then his wife, the First Lady of Detroit, got into a fight with w- [LAUGH], one of the dancers and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  All kind of foolishness that's been going on around here, so 
L:  And these are supposed to be people in places of respect and --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- positions of respect and stuff.  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yes, and I -- I feel so terrible because I am one of the p- [LAUGH] people who voted for him. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Thinking -- yeah.  You know, that -- 'cause he's a younger gentleman.  He's African American, thirty two years old, thinking, "Well, you know, if we stay out of the older politics maybe we'll get a fresh [inaudible]". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  And we --
L:  Get some fresh blood in there.
R:  Yeah, but we definitely did.  Complete with the diamond ear stud and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, they still like to party and stuff then. [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.  Yes, he does.  Yes, he does.  So, if you haven't heard about that you're -- you're gonna hear a little something some day soon, I'm sure.
L:  Right.
R:  So, but what's been going on there?
L:  Oh, California.  You know about our [SIGH] big d- -- uh, California deficit?
R:  Yes.
L:  And w- we went from like a, you know, whatever billion surplus down to a deficit and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- now everything's through the schools and everything.  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, we're trying -- they're trying to cut, you know, all these different things in the schools and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's our children who are gonna be -- be [NOISE] penalized, you know.
R:  Yes, that's true.  
L:  So, that's --
R:  That's true.
L:  That's really depressing.  And then, you know, trying to, you know, yeah, they're trying to, um, [MN] I guess with the police force they're trying to, you know, make it so that they're not, um, messing up with the police force and, you know, uh, they wanna rehire people and stuff like that but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, they don't have the money any more.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, that's one of the -- another thing that's happening here in California and stuff.
R:  I know, the economic times are just really affecting everyone.
L:  Right.
R:  In some shape or fashion.  This --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Bush, I just wanna know w- -- and the big question should be "Where?" for the [LAUGH] -- the Bush administration. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well, I mean, yeah, there was --
R:  "Where is Osama Bin Laden?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Where are these weapons of mass [LAUGH] destruction?" [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Well, you know what?  I wonder about this, you know, it's -- the Iraq war it's like, why didn't they get him, you know, ten years ago?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  If it was over [NOISE] ten years ago it, you --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- know, then we wouldn't have to [NOISE] have had all these [NOISE] people, you know, go and [NOISE] go to war and get killed and everything.  I mean, it's --
R:  I know, Pam, exactly.
L:  Fortunately it was very short.
R:  Hm.
L:  And, but still I mean look, you know, at the cost of how many billions of dollars to all of the American citizens.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  You know, and -- and in this economy it's messing us up more, right?
R:  Yes, it is.  It --
L:  You know.
R:  -- surely is.
L:  So, it's just -- I don't know what i- -- they didn't think it through before.  They could've --
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, if -- if it was this short this time, why couldn't they have done the same --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- strategy back then?
R:  Right, exactly, exactly.  I don't know.  There's always something else going on behind the scenes that we're not privy to.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  Unfortunately.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hm.
L:  Let's see.  What else is happening? [SIGH] I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  Well, like you say, you know, mostly the depressing stuff so [NOISE] you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  I was just, uh, watching a little bit of the news earlier but, you know, you got the murders and everything else and they're hoping that, what California -- they don't want California to be known as the highest murder rate [LAUGH] in the United States.  Something like that.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  I don't know.  It was something -- or -- or was it Cal- -- or was it Los Angeles or something.  I'm --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah.  It's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, bad things, you know, they were just talking about, um, a twenty five year old guy who just went to the House of Blues and then he went to a nightclub after --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and three guys wanted his Lexus so they shot him.
R:  Oh, I hate when stuff like that happens.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just insane.
L:  I know.  And it -- it's --
R:  That is just so crazy.
L:  I mean, everything right now I think life is too short.  I mean, he -- he [NOISE] supposedly [NOISE] they got the [NOISE] -- the car keys. [NOISE] He should've just let them take the car and go.  I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's insured.  Your life is --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- more important.  You know, right now, like I said with everything; the September eleventh and the war and everything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- else life is too short --
R:  Mhm, I know it.
L:  -- to worry about all these material things.
R:  I -- Pam, I agree completely.  I have found out -- I think it was last summer through a friend that I went to college with that one of our good friends was recently murdered, earlier that spring --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of last year.  Because, um, so he was driving some brand new truck, some fancy truck.  I don't even recall the name and, you know, they tried to carjack him and pulled a gun and told him to get out and he refused to leave the vehicle and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- he left it eventually.  You know, one way or the --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- other and they ended up killing him over a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- doggone[?] piece of truck.
L:  You know what?  Years ago before it was called carjacking, my husband [NOISE] and I when --
R:  Mhm, mm.
L:  -- we were dating, we had gotten carjacked. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, no. 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] That was like, gosh in ninety two.  It was like --
R:  Oh, no that had to have been terrifying.
L:  Yeah, it was.  I mean, and then, you know, coming to find out actually they'd, um, uh, I think it was a fake gun --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then it was a -- one of the guys had a steak knife.
R:  Ugh.
L:  But I mean, first thing my husband I is like, "Okay, here take it.  Bye, see ya".
R:  Exactly, that's the smart thing to do.  Just give it up.
L:  And then we went and we went to a friend's house and, you know, called nine one one and all that other stuff and, you know, it's just -- it wasn't worth it.  
R:  No, it isn't.  It never is.
L:  [SIGH] It wasn't worth it.  And that was the first thing we did is like, "Here, take it.  Bye.  See ya". [LAUGH]
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know.  It was eventually recovered and stuff like that but, you know, and then actually we did get the guy.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  We did get the guys and, um, you know, one of 'em, you know, served time.  He was uh -- he was, uh, um -- he was of age and then the other ones were minors and stuff.
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's terrifying.  But then, you know, like I said that was like the beginning before there were -- carjacking was like the norm.
R:  Right, right, right.
L:  And, um --
R:  Before the violence increased.
L:  Yeah, and it's just -- I don't know if it's the publicity that makes it, "Hey, that's a good idea.  Why don't I just ...".  It's easier just to take it from someone.
R:  I know.  I don't know where -- I don't know what the criminal -- but then if you're a criminal you're stupid anyway.  But, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Think about [LAUGH]  I mean, come on.  Some of the things they do.
L:  That's true.
R:  They're just so dumb.  And then it's like you don't wanna work for what you want and need so you're just gonna take someone else's, even to the point of completely extinguishing their lifeline? 
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  I don't know. [LIPSMACK] I don't understand.
L:  And then, you know, I mean, you watch the movie and see stuff like that and you read about it.  It's like it becomes easier and easier.  Once you've done it --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  It's -- you know, you just become, I guess, numb to it.
R:  Mm, unfortunately.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unfortunately.
L:  And it -- you know what?  That was another thing I just read in the paper.  In our area is interesting, um, all the mortuaries and funeral homes they held a mock funeral --
R:  Hm?
L:  -- protesting the violence against African Americans.
R:  Oh, a mock funeral?
L:  A mo- -- a -- a pretend funeral.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they had all the hearses and everything and they went -- went around, you know, South Central LA here in California --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Las Angeles.  They went up and down the streets with, uh, pretend funeral saying, "Stop the violence", and this --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and that, you know, because the, um, -- they were protesting.  Even though, you know, in their business the mortuaries and funeral homes and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  They're in it for the money but they don't wanna make money off --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- the death of innocent people.  I me- -- you know, the senseless deaths of young people.
R:  Oh, that was a different approach.
L:  Yeah, that was.  So, that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was actually a w- -- a current event that I just read about yester- -- in yesterday's paper.
R:  Well, that's good.  That's good.  Someone taking, you know --
L:  Yeah, that was -- and they thought --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] someone taking initiative to use their own creative, expressive ways --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to get the point across.
L:  Exactly.  Because people were wondering, "Well
