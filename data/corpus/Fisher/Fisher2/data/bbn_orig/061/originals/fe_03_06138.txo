L:  Hi!  My name's Erica.
R:  Hi, hello, this is Shelly here.
L:  Hi, Shelly.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm great.
L:  Okay.  So, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I guess we're talking about current events?  [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Okay, so --
R:  MM.
L:  -- how do you get most of your current events?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [MN] I'm really new in the US --
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, ah, regarding current events what I decided --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was I subscribe to a newspaper because I thought that -- that way I would get to [SIGH] read about so many things.  And I have subscribed to USA Today and it has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- four different sections about sports and the main news and life, --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff like that.  So, [SIGH] I basically update myself by reading the newspaper.  It gives me a lot of information and I get to know such a lot about, ah, this country as such.  What about you?
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Um, well I grew up with, ah, my family -- well would get a newspaper but not, um, I go to [SIGH] some of the web sites like CNN dot com --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and get a lot of my news there.  I don't really care to watch [SIGH] the TV for news --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- because it's -- it's a little too hyped up for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Media [SIGH] is definitely too hyped up --
L:  Exactly, --
R:  -- right now.  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  -- so I can't deal with watching all that.  [LAUGH]  So, ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What about ... like during the war did you keep up with that?
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I did keep up with that.  The newspapers used to be loaded with stuff on the Iraq --
L:  Right.
R:  -- war and I mean [LAUGH] [SIGH] -- so it was sometimes too much.  I would just like, [SIGH] you know, just skip through everything and just read the headlines and stuff, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, -- ah, you know, because it's the same thing every day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- over and over again.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  Yep.  [SIGH]
R:  So, that -- but -- it does like -- I like reading newspapers even in my country.  I -- I'm from India.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  So, ah, the net thing is not so prevalent there.  So, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- either we w- watch TV or we read newspapers.  Out here I think newspapers are a dying -- not exactly a dying thing, I wouldn't say that, but people are more in touch with the c- current news [SIGH] through net and through TV.  [SIGH]  Ah --
L:  Right.  Well, it seems to be easier on the net --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just because you can choose --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and you don't have to --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- manually, like --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- flip [NOISE] through pages and stuff.  And it's just a quick [SIGH] --
R:  Right.  That's true.
L:  -- a quick fix, I guess, of, [SIGH] ah, the news.
R:  And especially with the high speed Internet thing coming up.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  It doesn't take any time at all.
L:  Exactly.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  That is true.  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know, um, [COUGH] newspapers are good but, you know, it -- it's, um, [SIGH] yeah, I guess that would be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [MN] if I -- if I had a family and stuff I would definitely get a newspaper.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.  Right.
L:  It's just easier for me but, yeah, I checked on it for the war and stuff.  I was always on CNN dot com, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, looking things up.  My mom and my ... dad were really into the [LAUGH] war and they would --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- ... f- flip between -- every day they'd --
R:  Yeah, I know so --
L:  -- flip between all the --
R:  -- people who were like -- you know, sit in front of the TV for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- three to four hours and watch each and every, [SIGH] ah, c- clipping that they would show and it was [LAUGH] really too much for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I guess there are people who really --
L:  I thought it was crazy.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Now they -- it was -- it was more like just the -- ah, I don't know, it's not that they were s- so concerned with the war, it was just [NOISE] like something, I guess, exciting to do like a game or something.  And --
R:  As you said they hype it up so much.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  But, um, --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- they would flip between, you know, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then kind of ah, you know, but the -- the, ah, newscasters are so -- they're absurd, you know, like Heraldo and stuff.  It's like [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.  I really haven't seen much news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here on TV, because we don't have the cable thing as yet right now.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [MN]  And --
L:  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  [SIGH]  I mean --
R:  Right.  So, ...
L:  -- it -- it's like they're in mov- -- they think they're in movies and stuff.
R:  Ah, I used to see the BBC while I was India so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- we could get on to the BBC so ...  [SIGH]
L:  They're not as bad.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  Probably, [LAUGH] I guess so.
L:  Certainly not.
R:  [SIGH]  Um --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But --
R:  -- because I guess they have to be in competition for that as I know each channel is trying to outdo the other --
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  -- in covering the news and stuff.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah, they always say things like, [SIGH] "We were here first" you know, on the --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- scene and stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]  On the scene.  Reporting from the site.
L:  Like, I care who gets there first.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Does it make a difference to ... me?
R:  And ... that is why --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I decided to subscribe to a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- national newspaper.  Also, USA Today's a national newspaper.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] that's a good one.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's kind of like the newspaper I would read back in India.  The coverage and the kind of articles --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] are more or less style the same so I was used to that.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, this really helps me a lot and I get to know so much about this country seriously, you know, --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- which otherwise I wouldn't.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  Yeah.  I thought -- I -- I think USA Today is a good one.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, and then what about -- do you ever listen to the radio?
R:  Oh, radio, yeah, I find -- like we usually go for a drive or something like that we usually tend to switch it on and, ah, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then [SIGH] you get to listen to things.  [SIGH]
L:  Sometimes the r- radios --
R:  But it's most --
L:  -- g- good because they have, um, ... people debating and they have experts calling in and --
R:  Uh-huh --
L:  -- sometimes that a little more interesting.
R:  -- those radio shows.  Right, they're good, very good.
L:  Yeah, those are -- those are better than the TV I think.
R:  I like when you're driving you tend to just listen.  So, it's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- drive it gives --
L:  Yeah, exactly.  What area are you living in now?
R:  [SIGH]  I'm in San Jose.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  In Liberia.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, [SIGH] okay.
R:  So, ...
L:  [SIGH]  Um, what do you -- do you talk about current events with other people?
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, definitely, I mean if like people coming over to our house or we're going somewhere [SIGH] so ... things generally, you know.  Right now the latest issue is, of course, the Iraq war and the aftermath of the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Iraq war.  [SIGH]  So, that's how also you get to know so many things, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  People --
L:  Usually.
R:  -- some people know something and you know something so you discuss and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you will get to know the other aspect of it and things like that.  [SIGH]
L:  It's hard to say if we really, really know [NOISE] you know, what's --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's -- it's hard to decipher what's fact and what's fiction and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, just by the news because you --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, they're just trying to get a story, so you never know.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] what about -- yes, so being from India that -- that's kind of had some, -- ah, [SIGH] that's gotten some news lately too with the nuclear ... [SIGH] --
R:  I know India --
L:  -- issue.
R:  -- and Pakistan are all ... [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Is that a problem over there?  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, it is a problem.  We have the state called Kashmir so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- both the countries are trying to get a hold on to Kashmir.
L:  Right.  Who has it now?  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, it's -- it -- India has it.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  But Pakistan has occupied a major part of Kashmir so it's still being decided as to who [LAUGH] would get what.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  Right.  And why is it so important to get that land?  [SIGH]
R:  A- ah, it's -- I guess it's a legal issue now.  It's a --
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  -- test issue now and it's a very beautiful place.  It's actually called the paradise on earth.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, you have to be there to se- -- you know, realize what it is like.  It's really beautiful.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.  So, --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's sad 'cause a lot of the most beautiful places, you know, like Israel --
R:  I know, they're spoiling everything you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's so bad.
L:  It's a shame 'cause I -- I go to Israel every year and they, um, it's -- it's -- it's like you said, it's a shame because it's such a beautiful area.
R:  Are you an Israeli?
L:  [SIGH]  No, but I -- I was dating somebody who was.
R:  Oh, okay.  I know.
L:  I would go there every year.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, but it's -- it's such a wonderful, wonderful place.  And I've been to --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- Sinai, which is right, you know, part of --
R:  I know.
L:  -- Egypt and it's gorgeous.  But, you know, a lot of people won't travel there [SIGH] --
R:  Right, because --
L:  -- because they're scared.
R:  They're scared.  Mm.  [SIGH]
L:  Which, I mean it is -- it is an issue but it's not as big as the media makes it [SIGH] of course.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I mean there are more problems in America than there is over in Israel [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and other areas.  And, you know, all the A- Arab countries they --
R:  How many places have become inaccessible now because of all the issues, the political ter- -- and the terrorists --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- backing everywhere [LAUGH] and things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  But --
L:  No, it's a problem.  [SIGH]
R:  And now the SARs thing is coming up.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  Oh, that's -- that's really crazy.
R:  Right.  I know.
L:  I don't know that seems to be blown out of proportion [SIGH] as well.  You know, th- they've said like Toronto, you can't go there and stuff.
R:  They seem to have discovered a new disease everybody wants to talk about and you know ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Exactly.  Looks like that sometimes.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I mean if you look at the numbers.  [SIGH]  I think three hundred people or so died which --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- is -- if you look at the whole world that's not a very big number --
R:  It's not a big number.
L:  -- for -- for the crisis that is.
R:  And it's about -- I think they have about seven to eight thousand cases only and m- most of them have -- are, like, being treated properly.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  [SIGH]  Exactly.
R:  They're receiving proper treatment.  So, ...
L:  Exactly.  So, it's just been hyped up a lot and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it -- it causes, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it causes hysteria.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think ... it's especially big.  I don't know -- I mean I've travelled a little bit but --
R:  I guess that's the key to becoming the top --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, whatever field you are in --
L:  Of course, yeah.
R:  -- creating mass hysteria and stuff.  Or ...
L:  Right.  But it -- it's really silly.  I -- I would hope that people are smart enough, which I'm not sure they are but to, ah, realize that --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] that's what it is.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [SIGH]  But I never know.  People -- [SIGH] people get really crazy about that stuff.
R:  [SIGH]  I usually tend to skip the sports section because I'm not really into sports but I was just reading about this Kentucky Derby thing there was a --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- part regarding that.  [LAUGH]  Do you know about it?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the funny side I think it is.
R:  Yeah, the funny side.  This would -- horse I think it again won a race I think [NOISE] one more --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- race.
L:  Yeah, he -- for the triple crown, exactly.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  That should be interesting.
R:  Oh!
L:  I like -- I like sports.  I follow it -- it's --
R:  Okay.  [NOISE]  I just read about this and a couple of issues regarding the Ed Pedro[?] thing, you know, that drug --
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  -- which one of the athletes took and he died from an overdose or something like [MN] that.
L:  Right.  Yeah, there's really a lot of issues --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- in sports right now because of all the doping and drugs and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stuff with athletes there.
R:  And also because the kind of sports that they play here, the kind of games are very different from what they play in India.  In India [SIGH] cricket, if you've heard of cricket, it's the most --
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  -- popular game there.  [LAUGH]
L:  And don't you have, like, Hili[?]?  [SIGH]
R:  I didn't get you.
L:  Hi -- Hili?  Is that what it's called?
R:  Ah?
L:  The one with the, ah, [COUGH] where you have like the scoop thing and [NOISE] you s- scoop the ball [SIGH] and throw it.  Hi --
R:  No, no, no, no, no, it's not that.  You have a bat and a ball.
L:  Oh, no, I know -- I know cricket.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  But I was thinking of a different sport.
R:  No, no, ah --
L:  Yeah, cri- -- yeah, cricket's really big.  It's like baseball, right?
R:  It's a big thing there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, people really go crazy.  And now recently the world cup also took place in South Africa, the Cricket World Cup.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]  So, it was [SIGH] n- nice.
L:  It was a big deal.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But you don't -- we don't really hear about cricket over here.  [SIGH]
R:  You don't.  You don't.  [NOISE]  Nobody plays cricket here.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  It's baseball and basketball and soccer [LAUGH] and -- [SIGH] like that.
L:  Not even soccer.  Soccer's not even that big over here.  It's --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- ah, American Football ... is really big.
R:  A- American Football.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's the football thing, right?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Oh, yeah.
R:  I heard so much about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  It's very big.  [SIGH]
R:  The especially create ads, ah, when the live telecast is going on.
L:  Right.
R:  -- new ads like out on the TV for that event.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, there's lots of money involved with that.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  A ton of money with commercials and all that stuff.
R:  Uh-hum.  But the net is actually a very good thing, you're right, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, ... keep, I mean, twenty four hours update -- every minute just like there's something new and something like that.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, it's just -- it's very easy --
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  -- to check up on.
R:  Do you usually go to CNN dot com?
L:  Yeah, that is --
R:  That's one of the good sites.
