L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Evelyn.
R:  I'm Dianne.
L:  Nice to meet you, Dianne.
R:  What's all this about?  Do you know?
L:  Well, uh, did you sign up -- if you signed up to participate in phone surveys, basically we just talk to each other about how we get our current events for ten minutes.
R:  Do we get paid for this?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh?
L:  Huh?
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I think it's like ten bucks or [NOISE] whatever.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Detroit.
R:  Oh, I'm over here in Youngstown.
L:  Okay.  Well, we're not that far --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- apart from each other.  Well, now[?] I guess the topic is; how do we get our current events?  Do we get them from TV?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, most of the time I get my current events -- because I work so much, I try to catch up [MN] on the newspaper in the morning [LAUGH] while my -- over breakfast I usually try to catch up on whatever has happened throughout the night and, um.  Well, when I first get up I usually turn on CNN for the first ten minutes to see what's happened, especially with the war going on [SIGH] to get an update on what's going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How about you?
R:  Uh, [SIGH] I get the newspaper twice a week on the weekends and I try to catch the six o'clock news.
L:  Okay.
R:  Other than that, that's about it.
L:  That's about it.  Do you ever --
R:  I don't have Cable so I can't get CNN.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  And I work two jobs.  So --
L:  Uh, me too. [LAUGH] So, I totally understand that.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you ev- -- do you ever go on the internet to, um, catch up on the news?
R:  No.
L:  That's another way that I, um, usually --
R:  No.  I don't have the time.
L:  -- I can -- I go on the internet. [LAUGH] I understand. [LAUGH] Usually at work on my lunch break we have, um, computers in our lunch room --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I can log on and catch up on current events and -- [NOISE] and see what's the hot news going on.  Get about a -- a ten minute synopsis of what's going on in the world. [LIPSMACK] I, um, was just finding out that Bush's press secretary resigned today.
R:  I had no idea.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I just saw that on the internet.  Um, his -- his press secretary resigned today so   AOL usually is a good source.  They'll have whatever the -- the hot news topic.  It kind of flashes up when you sign on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, [LIPSMACK] you can -- if you're interested and also gives good information on, um, what's going on as far as the war.  You can get war updates and pictures and stuff like that so [SIGH]   I don't have time to really watch a full news cast.  Usually I'm doing something else while the news is on and I catch bits --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and pieces of it.  So 
R:  Well, I don't watch it every day.
L:  [LAUGH] Probably don't have the time to watch it every day.
R:  I'm not here.
L:  [LAUGH] I understand. [LAUGH] I totally --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- understand.
R:  It's the way it is.
L:  I -- I understand that totally.  So, did you sign up through the internet for this?
R:  Yeah, I did, uh-huh.
L:  Y- yeah.  This is my first call, so [LAUGH] it --
R:  Mine too.
L:  This is yours too?  Okay.  Yeah, I -- [NOISE] I'd signed up a couple of weeks ago and this was -- this is my first call.  So, I -- all's I know is that we're supposed to talk for ten minutes and [LAUGH] then they tell us when we're done.  So, [MN] um, I don't know if we're supposed to talk about current -- how we get current events for ten minutes, or [LAUGH] exactly what's going on.  So, I guess we'll have to wing it since both of us are newbies at this.  
R:  Well, the only other time I would here it is if I'm in the ra- -- in the car on the radio.
L:  On the radio.  Yeah.
R:  If it just so happens to be on the hour when the news is on.
L:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] That's true.  I catch -- most of the time I'll catch up with like entertainment stuff during the morning on the morning drive shows and stuff like that 'cause I have about a thirty minute commute to work.  So, I'm usually flipping back between stations during that time to catch up on what's going on.
R:  In fact now I just got done reading Sunday's paper.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I mean, I didn't even read it.  I --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I -- well, I -- well, you know what happens is there's always someone that leaves a newspaper in the cafeteria so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- usually I get to work about fifteen minutes early and get my cup of tea and I'll sit down and glance over what's going on.  Like that's when I read, uh, I was glancing over looking at the sports section 'cause I'm a Pistons fan and with us being in the playoffs I've been trying to keep abreast of what's going on with that.  So, it's been -- I grab the sports section and see what's going on with the updates with basketball and things of that nature.
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I don't do -- I don't do any sports.
L:  [LAUGH] No sports for you, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I understand.  That's -- that's my only outlet really is sport so I try to keep up with basketball and football. [NOISE] Those are the two sports that I usually follow but other than that the maj- -- like I said, the majority of it I'll tune in for -- to CNN in the morning as I'm getting ready and then I also get some g- -- I get some good information from the internet.  I do a lot of mystery shopping so when I'm online submitting reports and stuff like that I'll usually check out the headlines if something grabs my eye.
R:  I do some but not enough.  It -- I don't make all that much.  Right n- --
L:  How long have you been doing it?
R:  Almost two years.
L:  Really?
R:  But now it -- it's summer I'll be mowing lawns.  I make a lot more money.
L:  [LAUGH] I understand.  I understand.  I've been doing it for about -- about five years.  Um, I know in this market there's a lot of work so [LIPSMACK] I don't -- I don't do too bad.  It's a nice supplemental income.  A lot of the things I -- I have to turn down actually, a lot of work, because you know, you have to kind of judge what's gonna be profitable and what's not.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, I don't turn down work it's just that I -- s- somebody usually beats me to it some- --
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, really?
R:  Like I says I can't get on there like I want to.
L:  Oh, I gotcha.
R:  That doesn't help.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  It's 'cause --
R:  I've lost sleep.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, it's just --
L:  [SIGH] I know exactly what you mean.  A lot of -- a l- --
R:  They send me an email something's in my area and then I go check on it and it's gone.
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I know what you mean.  Do you ever go to any of the, um, self assign[?], um, sites?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Like I says, you know, I'm busy working.  I -- I have to support myself.
L:  Yeah, I understand that.  But, yeah, I think the one that I f- --
R:  I do have one clock job, you know, so it's for security.
L:  Oh, okay.  I --
R:  But it won't pay everything.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I actually work for a security company too.
R:  It doesn't pay enough to be able to pay everything.
L:  Yeah.  I understand.  Ye- --
R:  Minimum wages doesn't work.
L:  [LAUGH] I understand [LAUGH] totally.  I work for a se- -- a security firm in Michigan actually so we have a couple of things in common. [LIPSMACK] I, uh, for -- well, we do alarm and security so I actually --
R:  As far as news and like that; like I said I got the newspaper on the weekends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  All, you know, all I can afford, you know, I'm not gonna waste my money on it a week.
L:  Exactly.
R:  When I don't really need it.
L:  Right.  And that --
R:  The weekends I get it and I'll, you know, the news at six o'clock when I'm here and the radio.
L:  And the radio.
R:  If I'm in the car. [LAUGH]
L:  That, yeah.  That's my -- I don't get the newspaper at all.  I just --
R:  Right now I -- I listen for the weather and start mowing lawns.
L:  Yeah, that's a staple. [LAUGH] You gotta find out about the weather so you can plan your day.  So, that's one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the one thing I make sure I catch on the new- -- on the evening news is the best --
R:  So I can mow my lawns.  You know, I --
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Is that your side line?
R:  Well, yeah, right now.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, 'cause it's summer.
L:  Right.  Oh, it's a good time for -- it's a good summer gig.  That's definitely for sure.  But I can understand why you don't have a lot of time to catch up.  It's like when I get the newspaper and get to it I get to it.
R:  Like I says today's Monday and I just sat down and got done reading the Sunday paper.
L:  Reading Sunday's paper.  I understand.
R: [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, we, um -- I don't have a whole lot of time either to just sit down and read the paper so I try to catch bits and pieces of information through whatever sources I can.  Like I said on my lunch break I'll go online or when I'm submitting reports [LIPSMACK] online.  I usually -- I usually can find some good information.  That's actually where I usually find the most up to date information is because they're, you know, they're constantly updating it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- as things happen.  So, I like that fact that you can get the most up to date up to minute information, um, on the internet.  But like the problem is the downside to that is you get a lot of bogus information too sometimes.  So, we're not always as accurate but [LIPSMACK] some -- a lot of times they beat the newspapers with the info so   I like the internet and it's -- the morning paper's usually just kind of a ritual 'cause I don't have time to sit down and read the whole thing so I only have about fifteen minutes.  So I try to glance through; get through the important stuff, read the sports section and check out a few scores and --
R:  Well, that's one reason why I don't get it all week because I don't have time to read it.
L:  Yeah, they just, uh, that's what I -- I'm -- I'm [LAUGH] --
R:  Why spend the quarter?
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
