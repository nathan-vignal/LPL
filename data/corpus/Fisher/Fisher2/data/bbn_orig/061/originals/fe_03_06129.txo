R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  [SIGH]  Hi!
R:  [SIGH]  Hi! How are you?
L:  Okay.  This is Carol.
R:  This is Angie?  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, Angie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- How are you?
R:  N- -- f- fine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Have you done one of these before?
L:  [SIGH]  Yes, I have.
R:  [MN]  Okay.  Wh- --
L:  It's a --
R:  -- how will we know when the ten minutes are up?
L:  Um, the -- ah, operator will --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just break in and say --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] "Say goodbye to your partner, ten minutes --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- are up".  A- and --
R:  [NOISE]  Oh!  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, [SIGH] so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anyway, [SIGH] I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they want to know how we get news?  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How we get out news.
R:  [SIGH]  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay, um, --
R:  [NOISE]  Oh --
L:  -- [SIGH] I normally get mine from t- TV.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, [SIGH] I usually read [NOISE] newspapers online.  Robert, check on her please while I'm doing this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, sorry about that.
L:  Yeah, um, I do, ah, online -- like, Yahoo News.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, [SIGH] like I'll just quickly s- scan through it and if something [NOISE] is interesting I'll just go ahead an -- you know -- 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- open up that --
R:  [MN]  Open up that link over that one?
L:  -- that link, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I usually look at our local newspaper [SIGH] which is on line.  [SIGH]  Um, I'm in the midwest and then I look at USA Today.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, [SIGH] um, I guess it just depends on what's going on in the world [SIGH] that determines [SIGH] what I look at.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, like, when the war was going on then I -- I always be at CNN or MSNBC.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, um, [SIGH] yeah, when the war was going on, [SIGH] oh, well, [SIGH] actually it sort of still is, [LAUGH] isn't it?
R:  Hm.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, yeah, I -- we like BBC --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- News.
R:  [MN]  Oh, do you?  [NOISE]  Oh, I like that too.
L:  Uh-hum.  Um, o- of course --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but we're in Kentucky here [SIGH] and, it --
R:  I'm sorry?  [SIGH]  
L:  We're in Kentucky so we would only --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get it Monday through Friday.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we wouldn't get it on the weekends --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- [SIGH] and I like that because --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I kind of felt it wasn't s- slanted -- less to the right.
R:  Me, too!  Yeah!
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  [SIGH]  Me, too.
L:  Yep, so ...  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And o- of course when I'm out and about I listen to the radio.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, [NOISE] do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!
L:  And I -- I had to shut the war news off --
R:  [SIGH]  I know, --
L:  -- and put music on.
R:  -- wasn't it depressing?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  It was too much to take.  It really was.
R:  It was.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, for me too.
L:  Yep.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Are you part of one of the freebie sites too?  [NOISE]
L:  Um, n- no.
R:  Oh, okay.  I was just wondering how you heard about this?
L:  Um, I'm with a refund club.  It's called Refund Cents.  Is that what you meant?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, ah, is it on line?
L:  Ah, yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- Refund Cents and a friend of mine in Minnesota [SIGH] ah, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- told me about -- about this and, like, --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- "Okay, I'll try it --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- It sounds like fun".
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Now do you rely on [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] your f- friend -- friends for information?
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, sometimes I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and then, of course, I'll go ahead and, like, "M- m- mom!"  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh!
L:  You got -- like my daughter calls she's in college --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- you know, she lives in the next town over --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- in Lexington.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  And, ah, she's like, "Mom, ah, you'd better put the news on".  I'm like, "Wh- what happened?" and you know what I forgot what happened but, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she told me to put the news on and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I forgot what happened.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Um.
R:  I think back when [NOISE] nine eleven [NOISE] h- happened [SIGH] someone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was -- somebody called me and told me [NOISE] to t- turn on the news.  [SIGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, my husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- told me about that and I turned it on and, like, "Oh, my gosh! --"
R:  I know!
L:  "-- What's going on?"  [SIGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh, yeah, BBC is good [NOISE] though.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I like them for unbiased information.  [SIGH]
L:  Yep.  And, um, ah, a friend of mine was an indata[?] reporter --
R:  [SIGH]  Was he?
L:  -- for the Fox News network.
R:  Really?
L:  He was a cameraman.
R:  Well, that's okay.
L:  Ah, Christian, ah, Gerabaldini[?].
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, so, um, anyway that whole -- w- week -- he came back the next week.  [SIGH]  He did interviews the whole week.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  And I got to [LAUGH] see him on TV.  It was so nice.  [LAUGH]
R:  Was it?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  And did you email him while he was over there?
L:  I tried but they wouldn't let me through.
R:  Was the -- what h- happened did you get bounced back in?
L:  I didn't get anything back from F- Fox News network.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess that's their way of protecting --
R:  [NOISE]  Where he is?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, where he is.
R:  Oh!
L:  And he's in Russia right now, I think, um, --
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, is he?  [NOISE]
L:  Not -- not Ch- Chechnya?  [SIGH]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  He's in Chechnya now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is he?  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  So, he has to go -- he's the cameraman so he has to go where --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- they send them, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  I guess nothing's going on too --
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  -- [LAUGH] m- much now, [LAUGH] huh?
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  Oh, well, that's good he came home safe and --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- sound.
L:  Yep, [SIGH] for now.  Anyway, we all put a -- a big guardian angel on his shoulder.
R:  Oh!
L:  [SIGH]  Those of us and who are religious went ahead ... and said a little prayer.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't blame you.  [NOISE]  I don't blame you.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah?  So, that was nice.  [SIGH]  I hear you have children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the background.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so you're very busy?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.
R:  [NOISE]  Yes, you --
L:  My little ones are all grown up.  [MN]
R:  Are they?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Oh, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all through, mine are still at home.  [SIGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, [SIGH] are we supposed to stay on the subject?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, we are.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are we?  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Mm.
R:  It's -- ah, ten minutes doesn't seem like very long --
L:  No, not really.
R:  -- till you actually start talking.
L:  It'll be over, like, in about a minute or two here.
R:  Oh, will it?  Okay.
L:  Yep.  It's, ah, it's goes pretty fast.
R:  [SIGH]  So, let's see?  [SIGH]  Um ...
L:  [SIGH]  I go to magazines sometimes.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, like, ah, [MN] --
R:  Time?  Newsweek?
L:  Oh, [SIGH] yeah, Time, Newsweek, um, -- um, Money Magazine, ah ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Some -- ah, you know, things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like that.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, --
R:  Let's see?
L:  -- sometimes not always.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, unless the headline grabs me at the supermarket [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- that's the only time I really pick up one of those magazines.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] let's see.  [SIGH]  I know I have a friend, a coworker that we email news articles back and forth to.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]  Especially, like, when the war stuff was going on [NOISE] because there was such a spin on everything.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] 'cause I used to -- oh, I know where I found one too was +Reuters.  Is it +Reuters?  R.U. ... T.E. -- +Reuters -- R.U.T.E.- --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is it +Reuters?  Yeah, the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] news -- not the AP but the [SIGH] o- other news service.
L:  Reuters?
R:  Reuters, that's it.
L:  Reuters.
R:  O- okay.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  I'm right.  Okay.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  Not the college but --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  But that's the one I used to go to.
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Actually, I replied to Rucker's[?].  [NOISE]  It's a beautiful campus.
R:  Is it?
L:  [NOISE]  But I didn't get in.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  A long time ago.  [SIGH]  A long time a- -- twenty eight years ago.
R:  Oh!
L:  [SIGH]  I guess I'm giving my age away.  [LAUGH]
R:  Not really, your voice doesn't do it, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause you sound really young.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I'm almost fifty.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Are you really?
L:  Yep, uh-hum.
R:  Oh!
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I have two grandchildren.  [SIGH]
R:  Do you?
L:  Ah, yep.  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I've got [NOISE] just three.  I'd have a heart attack if I had ... grandchildren.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My oldest is thirteen.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  An eleven year old and a seven year old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The one making all the racket was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the seven year old.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  So, how many of these -- is this your first one?
R:  This is my first one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Yeah, they're p- pretty easy.  But it's nice if you -- you know, if you can participate in a -- a s- study like this.  [SIGH]
R:  It is.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  And then I -- from what I was reading on line and stuff, from the people who ... were in that forum with me [SIGH] you know, everybody was really nice.  And I said, "Hey, [LAUGH] you -- you know, maybe I --"
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  --"I'll try it".  Because the first time I think it c- came around I didn't participate.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's like, "What's this?  I have to give my Social Security number?"  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, that was --
L:  And then it's like -- it's for a -- a thousand dollar drawing for something, I don't what, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, "Okay, I'll try it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And the other one's like, "Well, [SIGH] if someone takes your identity [SIGH] you'll just --"
R:  You'll know where it came from.
L:  "-- go ahead and ... get a new number and we'll cancel the old one and transfer everything".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's a lot of stuff to [LAUGH] t- transfer.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is.  When you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] it is.
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH]  But I think that everybody ... you know, was saying that it was pretty reliable and [NOISE] [SIGH] they were getting paid and everything.
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  So, ...
L:  Right.
R:  I haven't heard any complaints.
L:  No.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I notice that certain newspapers are more -- well written than others.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Like the New York Times is wonderful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And, ah --
R:  I read the Post --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] the Washington Post.
L:  The Post.  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, also the Courier Journal is very well written and then there's --
R:  Where's the Courier Journal?  Where's that?
L:  That's, ah, Lex- ah, Louisville, Kentucky.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  And then, ah, I get -- I live outside of Lexington, Kentucky, so --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's the, um, [LIPSMACK] the Herald Leader.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And it's like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I found out that it's written --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- on a ninth grade ... level.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [SIGH]  And what -- what th- the Journal stipulated, "Go ahead and write it" [SIGH] and then [NOISE] the, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- program automatically --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dumbs down what they're written.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  The program automatically what?
L:  Dumbs down.
R:  Does it?
L:  Ch- changes.  [SIGH]  Put -- makes it easier for people to understand, you know?
R:  Less than ninth grade?
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, right to nine -- to ninth grade.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Let's say it's written on a college level.
R:  Oh, I gotcha.  Okay.
L:  It -- it brings it down to ninth grade level --
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I'm like, ah --
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah, it's like, "Well that doesn't help many people does it?"
R:  N- no, it doesn't.
L:  Yep.  Yep.  So, [NOISE] ...
R:  That's like a little tabloid type --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, so I've [SIGH] -- gosh, about eight -- about nine, ten years ago I found that out and --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- it's like well --
R:  It makes sense though.  You know, I guess that would be why some newspapers are more appealing than others, you know?
L:  Yep.  [SIGH]  Anyway, I didn't like that so I just ... g- get my Sunday copy now [NOISE]  And, um, [SIGH] then I -- I buy the Courier J- [LAUGH] Journal now.
R:  I don't blame you.
L:  [LAUGH]  Plus they have better coupons.  [SIGH]
R:  Do they?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And see that's very important.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  V- very important.  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  With -- with your newspaper [NOISE] at least.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I know, me too.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  So, I -- I go ahead and I -- I buy a bunch and I make a -- a little [NOISE] like -- that Sunday I put it in a folder, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- in a hanging file.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, that way I -- I -- m- my, ah, wrist doesn't give out when I cut my coupons.  I just [SIGH] c- cut the ones I know I'll use.  [MN]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I'll have it with my file.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  And then when they go ahead and expire [SIGH] I go ahead and send them to, ah, Germany.
R:  For the overseas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- military?
L:  Yeah, th- -- for the military, the commissaries because they go for six months after --
R:  I heard that.
L:  -- they expire.  Uh-hum.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, [SIGH] like, um, [SIGH] if you -- are you a member of, um, Michele Ester's[?] --
R:  No.
L:  -- Refunding Makes Cents?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  They have a list of people you can send your coupons to.
R:  Oh, do they.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You see I'm on a coupon train too.
L:  Oh, I see, okay --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- yes, yes, I've heard of that.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I just --
