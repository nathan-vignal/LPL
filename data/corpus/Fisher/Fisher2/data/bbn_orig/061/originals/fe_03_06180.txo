L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Well, hi.
L:  Hi, how you doing?
R:  I'm fine thank you, I'm Whitney.
L:  I'm Tequia[?]. [NOISE]
R:  Tequia?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] [NOISE]  Um, so, what do we --
R:  So I think we're -- we're supposed to be talking about how we get our news, is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well I happen to be a public radio junkie.  Um, I love, uh, uh, All Things Considered --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, uh, so I -- I keep my -- my radio tuned to, um, WNYC, I happen to be in New York City, I keep my radio tuned to WNYCNI.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I listen to All Things Considered.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  In the afternoon.  And I also listen to public radio in the morning before I go to work.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  So you are truly a junkie then?
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- when I miss it -- when I miss it I'll download it on my, um, on my computer, you can listen to, uh, archives of All Things Considered and other public radio shows, uh, w- if you have Real Player on your computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you can download it and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, and -- and listen to it w- whenever you want.
L:  Right.
R:  So I'll do that too, when -- when I miss a day, I love to do that.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Okay.  [NOISE]  Um, and -- and that's how you pretty much keep abreast?  You don't read any newspapers or anything?
R:  Not really, I don't.  Um, I mean, [LIPSMACK] um, no, I -- I really don't, uh --
L:  Just your radio station and you're cool.
R:  I- if there happens to be -- yeah, if there happens to be one in front of me by accident, like, I go over to my parents and they have The New York Times out, or if I'm maybe like, on a train or something or on a bus or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there is one, I'll -- I'll read it, but for the most part, no.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And you?
L:  Um, ooh, uh, I have a friend who calls me when there's some kind of major like, news story and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and normally he is the one who's kind of, um, made me aware of stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I watch MSNBC sometimes--
R:  Yeah, right, mhm.
L:  CNN sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ... I read the newspapers but primarily for, um -- I used to live in the DC area, I'm n- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm in the country area right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I can't get my Washington Post, but, um, when I lived there then I used to always make sure I got Sunday papers and Wednesday papers for the food section.
R:  Oh, for the food section?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  Are -- are you in the food business or ...?
L:  No.  No.  I'm in a unemployed business right now, but --
R:  Uh-huh, right.  I hear ya.
L:  -- I love food so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, yeah.  So I always make sure I check out the food section --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, on Sundays I check out the restaurant reviews.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but as far as news, yeah, it's pretty much, um, CNN or MSNBC.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh --
R:  Did you watch a love of war coverage during the -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- war in Iraq?  Yeah, neither did I.  [LAUGH].
L:  No.  And I'm a reservist.
R:  I actually actively avoided it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me too.  I'm in the reservist and --
R:  Oh you are?
L:  -- I rarely -- yeah -- and I really just don't, um, [LIPSMACK] I really just, you know, don't like the president and I just don't really agree with what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're doing, so --
R:  Hm, interesting.  Uh, [inaudible] uh, I don't, uh, I didn't agree with it either. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I really --
R:  Um --
L:  -- don't agree with what we're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing, so I didn't really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wanna watch it much 'cause it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stressing me but --
R:  Actually, that brings up something else, um, I -- I do get email a lot and I had -- and a number of my -- my friends were also against, uh, against the --
L:  The war.
R:  -- the US, uh, actions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  In -- in Iraq and, uh -- and there were -- there were lots of emails back and forth, um, and emails from -- from groups like, um, Not in Our Name, uh, peace -- peace groups like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Or I don't know if they're really peace groups but, you know, just organizations that were against the war and I would get email listings.  I -- I'm sorry, I -- I would get emails, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from them, that usually were forwarded to me by friends.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  So I would read that.
L:  Yeah, now what I was gonna say is that I also, um, you know, Yahoo is like, my, um --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- home page.
R:  Right.
L:  So they have like, a list of, um, news topics.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  And sometimes when they have topics that interest me I'll --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- read up on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I'll click on it and read the article or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I'd do that I guess.
R:  I do that too, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So I get news that way.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Um [NOISE], and that's pretty much it I think, as far as my news [NOISE] getting news.  That was it, right?  News, right?
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  Just news?  Yeah.  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]  That's pretty much it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes I'll do that, um, you know, uh, uh, you know, I'll just [MN] -- if I'm at work and I need to take a break from something I'll -- I'll do that, I'll just surf the Internet and see what, you know, like, uh, at MSN dot com or Google or what- -- or Yahoo actually, I -- Yahoo as well, I'll just see like, what --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] you know, what, um, uh, the topic of the day are, what -- like, or you know, someone wrote an opinion on something and I'll --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, just -- usually if it's not longer than -- it's hard for me to read stuff, to read lo- -- you know, long passages --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- on a computer.
L:  So that's --
R:  I don't like to do that.
L:  So hence the radio station. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, uh, but it's much easier for me to read an article --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a -- in a newspaper or a magazine than it is to read a full article on -- on a computer screen.  I don't know why, I just don't like to do that.  Um, it's just harder to read.
L:  You said it's easier to do it on the computer screen?
R:  No, it's easier, uh, for me to read longer articles, uh, in paper format --
L:  Yeah, in a magazine, yeah.
R:  -- than -- than on a computer, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, but -- but I think they're, you know, nowadays people are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much more savvy, it seems to me, about keeping Internet articles relatively short, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, well, I haven't really come across any that are normally, um, [NOISE] [MN] regarding news.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I haven't come across too many articles that are more than a page.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [NOISE] ... but, yeah.  I'm sitting here watching the news now.  I hate the news.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Let me change the channel.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I really do, it's so depressing.
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm in New York City now and, um, I mean, just about all you hear about is the fiscal crisis --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how nobody has any money any- anywhere and everybody's losing their jobs and --
L:  yeah.
R:  -- and, um, um, you know, and -- and they're -- they're -- they're -- they plan on making more cuts to, um, to services and it's just -- yeah, it's -- it is -- it is, uh, it's depressing and it's anxiety provoking too! [LAUGH]  Like, I try to act -- in fact, I try to stay away from news, um, around, um, around bedtime.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And like, you know, within hour or two, uh, before bedtime because, uh, then I find it hard to sleep. [LAUGH]  If I listen to the news too late.
L:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well do you watch the evening news, like, eleven o'clock?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I avoid -- I avoid all news.
R:  Mm.
L:  The only time I really, well, I used to have a friend that I lived with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he always watched, you know, that's pretty much why I -- how I got into watching like, CNN and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But he pretty much watched the news and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I whatever -- I would just watch whatever he --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- watched.  But normally if I have to choose for myself I'm -- I'm watching TLC, or a fixer upper show or something or the food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- station or, you know, my favorite shows on HBO or whatever, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you ever watch Comedy Central?
L:  Um, I do because [MN] again, the same friend is always trying to get me to watch the Dave Chappelle Show.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And I alwa- -- I keep forget- -- I keep on forgetting to watch it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Matter of fact, I think it comes on at eleven, let me see.  But, um --
R:  I think the Dave Chappelle Show is usually on Wednesday nights, right?
L:  Oh is it?  Only -- Charlie, stop!  I'm sorry --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- my cat.  We took in --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- a stray and he always like, gets weird, if you wiggle your toes he'll attack and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] He just grabs the mess outta me, so I'm sorry.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um --
R:  Oh, my sister has a cat, uh, she knows -- that she picked up from the SPCA, she knows how that is.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Okay, the Daily Show now.  Yeah, I think Dave Chappelle is only on Wednesdays.  That's probably why I forget to watch it all the time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But no, yeah, I don't really typically watch it.  Sometimes I catch like, um, repeats of Saturday Night Live or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, no, that's one of your stations?  Do you like it?
R:  Um, yeah, I like Comedy Central and I was gonna say that I find, uh, I -- sometimes I learn about things, like I learned about, um, you know how there was that thing last week about, um, uh, in Texas the democrats holed themselves -- they left, uh, uh, Texas, uh, and holed themselves up in a Holiday Inn in Oklahoma --
L:  No! [LAUGH]
R:  -- to protest.  Yeah, it was to protest --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and some -- some --
L:  No, I hadn't heard that.
R:  -- redistricting.
L:  But it was a prot- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's to protest what, now?
R:  Some redistricting.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh, uh, r- redrawing the -- the district lines --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in the state of Texas to favor the republicans.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I didn't -- the way I found out about that was, uh, actually watching, um, uh, The Daily Show with John Stewart, on Comedy Central, because he was making fun of it.  He was just -- he was just like -- I -- I think it's very good political satire and that's how I found out about that event.
L:  Yeah, I'm standing here watching it now.
R:  Like, I didn't find out about it from listening to the radio or from reading anything on the Internet, I found out about it from watching a comedy show.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  That is interesting 'cause, you know, now I -- now I think about it, sometimes I do hear stuff when I watch, um, [LIPSMACK] -- God, what is his name?  I forgot.  Funny looking [SIGH] -- funny, I just -- my favorite nighttime show and I can't even think of the name of it right now.  What is his name?
R:  D- David Letterman?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Jay Leno?
L:  Letterman! [LAUGH]
R:  Letterman, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  'Cause I really, really -- I -- I like, purposely try to stay
