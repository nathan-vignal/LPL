L:  Hi, I'm Helen.
R:  Hi, I'm Julie. 
L:  How are you?
R:  Oh, fine.  How are you?
L:  Okay.  I guess the topic is what, health and fitness?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm terrible. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't exercise as often as I should.  And probably won't be able to get back into it until my work gets organized.
R:  Well, I do every day.  I get up about fifteen till five. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness. 
R:  [LAUGH] And I exercise for probably an hour and then I do about a half an hour's worth of sit ups and stomach stuff.
L:  Oh, you must be gorgeous. 
R:  No. [LAUGH]  No, I try, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  How long have you been following --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- this routine?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, probably about a year.
L:  Oh --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- that's impressive. 
R:  I have five kids, so I've just -- I'm wanting to tone up. [LAUGH] I was just, ew. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I bet it gives you plenty of energy.
R:  Um, no. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No? 
R:  [LAUGH] Not really. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It should, but it doesn't. 
L:  Oh, gosh.  Well, you must enjoy it?
R:  No. [LAUGH]  No, I really don't.  I just --
L:  Okay, you're getting healthy. 
R:  Okay, we'll look at it like that. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I just -- I really just wanted to tone up [COUGH] because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- after -- after five kids, one after the other --
L:  Phew.
R:  -- [COUGH] oh, allergies are terrible with me --
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  -- [COUGH] I just was really out of shape.  So, that was my main thing. 
L:  Oh, I did the reverse.  I, um, I used to work out constantly, um, I -- also on a daily basis, I was into body sculpting and weights and free weights and resistance and you name it, aerobics, I did it all [LIPSMACK].  And about ten years ago I had surgery and tried to slowly get back into it, but I didn't.  Which was extremely stupid. [MN] So now I'm -- if -- if I get back into [LAUGH] some routine, I'm going to have to find something that I enjoy.  Otherwise I'm not going to stick with it.
R:  Mm.  Well, it's just -- I make myself, that's the only thing, I just -- I don't like to do it, but it's something that, you know, I make myself do.  
L:  That's great. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's great, that you have that kinda willpower. 
R:  [MN]
L:  I think that's what it takes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that and the desire to be healthy.  You know, to, ah, be the best that you can be physically and that way everything else pretty much falls into place.  Hopefully.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's wishful thinking, isn't it?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] That and a dollar fifty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- won't even get you a cup of coffee these days. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, what area of the country do you live?
R:  I'm in West Virginia [MN].
L:  No kidding?
R:  Mhm.  Where are you at?
L:  Oh, I'm in Florida, but my husband's from West Virginia. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, that's a -- a bit difference.  I've been to Florida a few times, um, doing the Disney World thing [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  That's where most people end up.  There or Miami.
R:  Yeah, I've never been to Miami, I'm --
L:  You're not missing a thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I have been to Tampa.  I have an aunt that lives in Tampa and I went to visit her and went to [inaudible] gardens, um --
L:  It's a pretty area. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's -- it's still a city.  I live about fifty miles north of Tampa and it's, ah, a lot more -- it was [LAUGH] a lot more rural.  Um, now it's becoming a suburb of Tampa.  So, oddly enough, it's -- it's, ah, [inaudible] this is the topic of conversation, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, they're opening up a number of gyms here now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I'm kind of looking into that thinking, "Okay, this is something I might do".
R:  So I'm about probably over an hour away from a gym.  I mean, I'm out in the boonies. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well, that's kinda nice.
R:  Yeah.  It's good.  You know, has its good points and bad points.  But ...
L:  Yeah, but still, you -- I mean, you get the best of both worlds -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is pleasant.  Obviously you're on the internet, otherwise you wouldn't be on the phone. 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  No, you have that.  Yeah, my, um, [LIPSMACK] my husband's family is up in the Pan Handle --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and in fact the last place I was at in West Virginia was Sistersville. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Which nobody's ever heard of.  
R:  Oh, I've heard of it, I -- um, I think when we -- when I was in high school our team, ah, played then maybe at one point.  I don't think they did do any more. 
L:  Ah.  I'm curious, you said you've been exercising a year.  What motivated you to start a year ago?
R:  Um, I just -- I don't know, I just got sick of the flab. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ahah.  
R:  You know, just, you know, like I said, I have five kids, one after the other, and, you know, that whole extra tyre thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just -- I was sick of it and [SIGH] I just wanted to do something and I can't really see that it's helped much.  I've lost maybe ten pounds, but [SIGH] I don't know, I can't really see that I've toned up that much, for what I do.  Now, I do [COUGH] an hour's worth of [COUGH] mostly just jogging in place and then with weights. 
L:  Wow.
R:  And then I do three hundred sit ups and I do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- fifty stomach crunches and I just, you know, I can't see that, with what I'm doing, that -- I can't see a great big difference. 
L:  Have you heard of Pilates?
R:  Yeah.  And I've done a few of those, but I don't know, it's just [SIGH] if I can't figure it out easily enough, I just don't do it. [LAUGH] 
L:  There is, um, some tapes out now.  I -- I actually have, which my husband [inaudible] -- from where I'm sitting, it's four feet away, I have the Pilates, the, um, premiere, the machine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, ah, I got that for, actually not to really work out, but for physical therapy.  Ah, [LAUGH] on top of everything I had a car accident.  Some idiot rear ended me and, um, I ended up with some back problems, some lower back problems --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we're lucky --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- that we have a pool and we are -- we're off in a climate where we can use it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was told to do pool exercises, and I went to a physical therapist who was using pilates -- using the machine and, ah, it actually felt so good that I bought one to use at home.  But then again I lost interest.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm a terrible person. 
R:  Well, those machines -- I don't know, I can do those maybe a week and then it's, like, "Oh, this is boring". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have a Nordic rider.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And I try to force myself to use it a little bit each day, but I don't -- I don't use it enough to amount to anything. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And I did get the Pilates for Dummies tape, but I haven't looked at it yet. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I ordered it from over stock dot com, because it was really cheap and I thought, "Well, I would watch that, maybe that would help", but I haven't even taken the wrapper off the pa- -- off the --
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, some of it -- a- a- and it looks like some of the floor exercises with that are excellent.  [MN] And, you know, actually if I used this -- this stupid machine, now you're giving me a little bit of motivation -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it would help.  I know it does help.  It seems to make -- to give you a longer leaner look. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the weights and the s- -- well, the sit ups are great, but there's also exercises with Pilates that, um, they concentrate on, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what's it called, the something of power, um, [LIPSMACK] it's at basically the trunk of your body to get that as strong as it can possibly be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to support all your organs and it makes you healthy or -- and for some reason it makes sense to me, but again the motivation -- I work on the computer, which is a horrible thing. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The money is fine, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, your butt gets wider [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and -- and you just, you know, also working out of the house you don't have the motivation that you have to look as good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and or to clean the house. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  As you do if you even come back on a regular basis.  I -- I just can't imagine with five kids, I don't know where you even get the time.  I ca- -- I can see why you get up so early. 
R:  Yeah, that's why I have to.  Because I've tried, like, during the day, and I just can't, even with three of them in school, you just can't, because you've got two wanting something constantly, so I just -- I have to do it before anybody gets up and, you know, I just know that's what I've gotta do. 
L:  That's --
R:  Is make myself. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's great.  So you have me time?
R:  Mm, I guess. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well --
R:  Some me time.
L:  Yeah, so -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so -- you're in pain --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- big deal. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, my idea of good me time would be sitting down and eating a reecey[?] cup. [LAUGH] 
L:  Ooh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, don't deprive yourself of great things too.  You know, things that make you happy.  
R:  Well, and see, that's why I exercise because I can't -- the whole deprivation thing, I can't do that.  I've tried the dieting and I can't do it. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm one of these people that can sit down and eat a six pack of reecey[?] cups and not think anything of it. 
L:  Ooh. [LAUGH] 
R:  So ... [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I had to do something to counteract. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but that sounds so good. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know.  It [inaudible] a reward. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, and it should be.  I don't think -- I really don't think we should deprive ourselves. 
R:  No, I don't either. [LAUGH] 
L:  Plus, I -- I -- and, you know, I -- I remember reading -- of course this is the only thing I've read that's stuck, but [MN] that when we have cravings for certain things, it's because our body requires whatever nutrients that substance provides. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  And I liked that.  So, I figure my body really requires a lot of [LAUGH] cocoa. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's mine too.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] As far as good foods, no, can't say that I really eat much of that, you know.
L:  Well ...
R:  I -- as -- like to sit down and eat a meal, nah.  Just gimme -- gimme a couple of candy bars and a diet coke and I'm happy. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Actually me too. 
R:  [LAUGH]
