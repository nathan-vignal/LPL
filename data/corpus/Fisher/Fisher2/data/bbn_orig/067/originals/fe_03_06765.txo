R:  Chris.
L:  Mike Daniels[?]. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm in Tennessee.  And you are?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, I'm in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Seattle.
L:  Cool. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, what changes have I made in my life since the attack of September eleventh?  Um, [LIPSMACK] I hadn't spoke to my m- to my parents in ten years --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when that happened, um, I had decided that whatever issue it was that I was upset with my parents over was not really worth it, so I have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- again got in touch with my family. [NOISE] I don't fly anymore, [NOISE] um, there's quite a few other things, [NOISE] what about yourself? [NOISE]
L:  Uh, since it happened, uh, I don't know, I'm more leery about riding the bus, I know that, [NOISE] um --
R:  Oh, yeah, I can -- I can see that.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] see I -- I don't think I'm a -- I'd be afraid of flying anymore, I actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kinda l- I like, I enjoy flying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if I can --
L:  Uh-huh.  Right.
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put a big shudder through my bones when it first happened --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, I couldn't believe, I -- at first, I th- when I heard it happening I didn't believe it was first happening.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Then shock, yeah.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was a big shock.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, definitely.
R:  And, uh --
L:  I w- I watched it live.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I --
R:  -- so did I --
L:  Did you?
R:  -- I -- I -- I tried to watch as much as I could.
L:  No, I stuck to the TV set all day long.  I think for three or four days I couldn't move myself [NOISE] away from --
R:  Actually --
L:  -- the television set.
R:  -- you know, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I couldn't turn the TV on the next day, I actually was d- dreading hearing all the bad things that was -- was going on.
L:  I can understand that.  Well, I had -- my sister died in that.
R:  Your sister --
L:  Uh, she --
R:  -- passed away in that?
L:  Yeah, she was in the first tower --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- she worked in a restaurant and, uh --
R:  I can see why it changed your life, now.
L:  Yeah, that's why I couldn't tear myself away from the television set. [NOISE]
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh, I was hoping tha- that --
R:  I'm sorry --
L:  -- she w-
R:  -- to hear that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, it's okay, you know.  I appreciate the fact that, you know, you're sorry about it, but, I guess it was her time, there must have been a reason --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, for that to -- her -- for her -er to have been at work that day.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know?
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  If --
R:  Can I ask you, did, uh --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- they ever recover her body, or ...?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No. [SIGH]
R:  No?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  They never did find her.
R:  Sorry about that. [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- yeah, that's okay, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- [NOISE] when I hear- when I saw it, you know, uh, the first tower had already been d- [NOISE] hit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, it was on TV, I was in front of the TV set, uh, stunned and dazed and confused.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I watched the second one hit live and of course when the first tower fell, I knew, I -- I felt it in my heart, "That's it, she's gone, I'm never going to see her again". [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I, uh, [SIGH] you know, uh, it's really funny --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after, uh, that happened, after September eleventh I, uh, I, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] I go to a -- a -- a -- a facility, early in the morning, I had been assaulted --
L:  Mm huh.
R:  -- in October, I got all of my teeth knocked out of my face.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And, uh, that really, uh, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- made me think about how things sh- are now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It happened, like I say, probably about a month after it happened, I, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some people, uh, uh, uh, tried to rob me, they pulled me into, uh, the bushes --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And if I --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- don't think if I would've fought as hard as I did I'd probably be dead.
L:  Wow.
L:  They took, uh, [LIPSMACK] I think it was a fire extinguisher and s- smashed me across the face with it --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- it knocked, uh, seventeen teeth out.  Actually --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I had seventeen teeth removed altogether, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  A- and --
R:  -- is, uh --
L:  -- they robbed --
R:  -- a lot of -- lot of different things happened after September eleventh, so --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] [LAUGH] They robbed you, I mean attacked you --
R:  They didn't --
L:  -- just to rob you?
R:  -- rob me 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't let 'em take the money.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So --
L:  And they just -- they [NOISE] just beat [NOISE] you to death, [NOISE] basically, because [NOISE] they did --
R:  They were --
L:  -- they wanted it --
R:  -- trying, yeah, they were --
L: [NOISE] 
R:  -- all -- they, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were all --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- attacking me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were all trying to pull me into the bushes and --
L:  [NOISE] Ah.
R:  -- you know, get me out of the way, uh --
L:  Now --
R:  -- or --
L:  -- were these Irani[?] people [NOISE] that were doing this [NOISE] --
R:  No, they --
L:  -- to you or --
R:  -- they were, uh --
L:  -- just regular people?
R:  -- Spanish people.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my gosh.
R:  Or, Lati- -tino, or something, some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some nationality.
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
R:  You know, and, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the area I live in is like that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- around Seattle --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a lot like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that, so --
L:  Oh, I used to -- you know, I used to live [NOISE] in, uh, [NOISE] right next to Spokane, Washington, over there and Idaho.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm -- I'm on, uh, totally a whole other side of -- of Spokane.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, Spok-
L:  I -- I know where Seattle is. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah. I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- I live, uh, I'm not too far from SeaTac Airport --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- probably within about two miles away.  About two --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- miles.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  So --
L:  My goodness, I --
R:  As a matter --
L:  -- can't believe --
R:  -- of fact, I go through SeaTac Airport every day. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Oh, do you really?
R:  Yeah, I -- I'm on the bus, I take the bus --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- early in the morning, so I'm on, you know, but after September eleventh I've been, you know, thinking, "Okay, now, they're going to blow up a bus", you know.
L:  [MN] It is, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I hate to say it, that is a possibility, 'cause they --
R:  Yeah, I know --
L:  -- do do a lot of --
R:  -- every -- every --
L:  -- bus bombings.
R:  -- morning I'm on the bus, I'm, like, you know, looking around, like, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Anybody suspicious?
R:  I mean, I'm not trying to be prejudiced or anything, but, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I see a -- a --
L:  [NOISE] You can't help --
R:  -- an Arabic --
L:  -- but be.
R:  -- person with a big duffel bag I get real nervous.
L:  Well, yeah, I -- I can --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- understand exactly why you would get nervous.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] Uh, I know [NOISE] um, living here in -- in ne- in Tennessee, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a lot of Iranis[?] that own these little stores. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  And --
R:  -- same thing here, too.
L:  Yeah, so, that does make me paranoid when I go into the stores here, I mean, they constantly change who's working behind the counter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, so, since then, I mean, when it happened, uh, at first our little Irani[?] store, we had one guy sitting up here who was asking everyone coming in, because they were paranoid, too, of what us Americans were going rebel against them, because it was their people who had done that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they were asking all of us that had come in the store, you know, what we thought about it and this and that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I -- I had talking -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had a few conversations with a few cab drivers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- after that happened, um, I d- drove a cab a little bit right afterwards --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, they were from, uh, like Pakistan and Afghanistan, areas like that.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, I mean, I don't think, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you should judge everybody for, you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- what -- what ten or twelve people do, you know, you can't judge a whole -- but I mean --
L:  Handful.
R:  -- if you look at it this way, their -- their religion is a lot different than ours, you know?
L:  Ye- I agree with you, it is.
R:  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh --
L:  I don't know much about the religion --
R:  Uh, Muslim is quite a different religion, if you've, uh, ever st- uh, looked at, you know, studied it, it's -- it's got a quite of a, uh, a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different belief.
L:  [NOISE] Well --
R:  You know?
L:  -- I'm pagan.
R:  You're pagan?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm Wiccan, so, um, I'm used to getting, you know, the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- rejection from, 'cause I live in the Bible Belt --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gosh, I'd --
R:  Yeah, Tennessee. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's right.
L:  God forbid, save me from your followers. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My favorite saying. [LAUGH] No offence --
R:  Actually --
L:  -- I mean, I --
R:  -- I don't go to church, so, you know, I -- I -- I'm not really any religion.
L:  Oh, okay --
R:  You know.
L:  -- right.
R:  So, I'm just --
L:  Well, being -- being Pagan, uh --
R:  I think everybody's c- allowed to be what they want, so long as it doesn't hurt anybody.
L:  You're just, right, and they don't push it on you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yada, and I'm the same --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- way --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- I don't like them pushing their religion on me [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't push mine on anybody else.  You know --
R:  And as long --
L:  -- what they choose --
R:  -- as it's not hurting nobody, then [MN] --
L:  E- exactly.
R:  -- um, m- no --
L:  [NOISE] And I --
R:  Why --
L:  -- think they --
R:  -- why's it --
L:  -- did that --
R:  -- anybody's business, you know?
L:  Right, and --
L:  Especially --
L:  -- did --
R:  -- United States, uh, for your freedom of religion.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Freedom of --
L:  Well --
R:  -- everything --
L:  -- that --
R:  -- basically.
L:  -- and, you know, they hate us because we have, you know, we're supposedly rich and they're not, but it -- it's not our fault, it's their own government that has done that to them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Has -- has it -- September eleven, has it changed your belief in anything?  I mean [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  -- does it --
L:  -- as in --
R:  -- make you think that --
L:  -- for --
R:  -- people are -- [SIGH] are worse than what you probably thought they used to be? [LAUGH] You know, humanity?
L:  Um --
R:  They actually do something like this --
L:  Well --
R:  -- because  I --
L:  -- I-
R:  -- never thought this would really happen.
L:  Happen here at home?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're right.  And I never did expect it, either, to be honest with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you and when --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- it did happen --
R:  -- I expected --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something to happen, but not like --
L:  Not that --
R:  -- this.
L:  -- yeah, that was a huge magnitude, I'm --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- shocked.
R:  How many people?  Was it two thousand, three thousand?  Three thousand people, was it?
L:  Yes, yeah, three --
R:  That were --
L:  -- thousand people --
R:  -- killed.
L:  -- yeah.  Yeah, it was --
R:  So --
L:  -- qui- quite a few.  Um, I know that, uh, like, when -- when the anniversary came around --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] and I'm a telemarketer by trade --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [NOISE] and, uh, basically when -- when -- when the first anniversary came around [NOISE] there was no way could I work that day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because obviously --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I mean, I'm remembering my --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- sister who died, [NOISE] uh, so sorry that she was in the restaurant business, I wish she could've done something else besides --
R:  There was --
L:  -- that --
R:  -- quite a few restaurants in -- in those buildings --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- weren't there?
L:  Yes, there was.
R:  Like, about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every other floor, wasn't it?  Or --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Oh, I wish I --
R:  Or there were, like, a lot of little delis and stuff there, like --
L:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Was a, mm, big business, a lot --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- of people. [NOISE]
L:  Well, c- what's, well, it was the World Trade Center, I mean, everybody went there to [NOISE] do their business, do their trades --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the --
R:  I'm surprised a lot more people didn't die, actually.
L:  [NOISE] I -- I --
R:  You know?
L:  -- think the m- the most amazing thing to me was seeing -- was watching people jump out of the buildings live, on TV, watching these people --
R:  Yeah, see I couldn't handle that, I -- I --
L:  I mean, it's --
R:  -- didn't, uh --
L:  -- "Oh, my God".
R:  -- I didn't even -- never saw that, when they ever showed it -- you know, when they show the documentaries?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't -- I turn it off, 'cause I -- I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- just don't like seeing that, it's just -- [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I -- I --
R:  -- awful.
L:  -- I look at it like this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, history has a tendency [NOISE] to repeat itself if you forget --
R:  Oh, yeah I --
L:  -- what --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- has happened.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And because --
R:  I hope --
L:  -- of that --
R:  -- that never happens, you know, I don't think it will. [NOISE] I mean, if we don't --
L:  No --
R:  -- forget.
L:  -- we've -- we definitely have a higher state of awareness now --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I know myself, I do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, I'm thankful I don't have to -- to ride any cabs or on buses.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have my own vehicle. [NOISE] So that doesn't seem to be so much of a problem for me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But, going to these little stores a-...
