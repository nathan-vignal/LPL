R:  Hi, this is Thomas.
L:  Hi, this is Joyce.
R:  Hi, Joyce, how are you?
L:  I'm fine, thank you.
R:  Great.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from North Carolina.  And --
R:  You --
L:  -- you?
R:  You're calling from North Carolina?  Well, I'm calling from Ohio, but I, uh, I lived -- lived in New York City, so --
L:  Oh, okay.  At the time?
R:  Yeah, at the time also.
L:  Oh, did you move?
R:  Um, well --
L:  Um --
R:  -- all my things --
L:  -- because of that?
R:  -- are st- yeah, all my things are -- not after that, no, I didn't have, um, I just actually just got back to Ohio just a couple of weeks ago.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  So, I, uh, I stayed in New York City, um, after -- after the September eleven attacks and all the way through.
L:  You did?
R:  So I was there during and after, yes.
L:  Wow.  Were you close to it?
R:  Um, I was close to it, I was about a m- a mile away, um, on -- on Fifteenth Street, which is, um, you know, I could -- I could see the towers and, you know, not from -- I mean, you know, you could see the towers mostly anywhere from Manhattan, so they were kind of, um, they served as good beacons and like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they -- they were just kind of like, you could, uh, wherever you came up out of the subway you could always look up and just get your bearings --
L:  Right.
R:  -- by looking for the towers.  I don't know if you're familiar -- have you been to New York City?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay, so then --
L:  Yes.  I used to live in New York State.
R:  O- oh, okay, well, then --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know what I'm talking about. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah, it, uh, so, so afterwards I think, um, that was part of the reason why many people, or many New Yorkers, certainly felt very kind of confused after, um, after --
L:  A-
R:  -- they were gone, 'cause you'd look up and they were gone and [NOISE] --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know.
L:  That's that --
R:  So --
L:  -- well, it's very traumatic for everybody, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah, certainly, uh, I, um, well, what -- what changes, do you want to -- I guess maybe we should answer the question that, what changes have you made, or if any?
L:  Um, I don't think I've really made any changes into my life, uh, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't, you know, other than being more careful, I would say.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Be more aware of everything.
R:  Right.  I -- I also didn't necessarily make any changes, I, um, I'm an artist and I did do a project, um, I'm submitting, actually just today, it's ironic that this is the topic of today, but I'm submitting, um, a rep- a proposal for the World Trade Center site memorial.
L:  Oh, how wonderful, well, I wish you a lot of luck on that.
R:  Thank you very much.
L:  I --
R:  So I --
L:  -- that's --
R:  -- they, I guess --
L:  -- something that really needs to be attended to. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think that's something that's also, it -- it's something that kind of, um, I guess was, uh, well, you know, I mean it's something that came up from out of me while I was living there, so --
L:  Well --
R:  -- um, it's kind of like it --
L:  -- that's wonderful.
R:  -- it's kind of real personal to me, too --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so, um --
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  -- I guess that would be the changes I guess that I would have [LAUGH] would have made, I kind of wrote a whole piece about it and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I have a -- a model and a design concept for the idea for the memorial, so --
L:  Well, that's great.  I -- I had -- I was a little hesitant, we just came back from overseas and I was a little hesitant about going, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- everything turned out fine and I thought, "Well, if it's my time, it's my time".
R:  Hear, hear.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, where did you go overseas? [LAUGH]
L:  So, I --
R:  Where did you go?
L:  -- um, Italy and, uh, Germany, Austria --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and Czech Republic.
R:  You went to the Czech Republic?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, I'm part Czechoslovakian.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's really, so how was the Czech Republic?
L:  Oh, it's beautiful.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you went to Prague, then, or --
L:  Went to Prague, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's amazing.
L:  Yes, it was --
R:  How --
L:  -- great.
R:  -- how long were you gone for?
L:  Uh, twenty days.
R:  How fantastic.  Who'd you go with?
L:  Um, my son and daughter in law.
R:  Your son and daughter in law?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow, that's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- it was a great trip.
R:  -- I want to -- I do want -- I want to take my mom over to Italy as well and also to the Czech Republic 'cause she's a -- the connection through, uh, because we're part Czechoslovakian, so --
L:  Oh, that's great, I hope you go.  It's --
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  -- it's well worth the trip.
R:  Yeah, definitely --
L:  And --
R:  -- at some point.
L:  -- I'm not, and like I said, I -- I don't think you can be afraid forever, you know?
R:  No.
L:  But, you can't live your life like that.
R:  No, I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that that's where part of, um, part of the design for my memorial concept is, it takes, it looks like, um, it looks like the four, um, looks like the four airplanes, the tails of an airplane?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It kind of looks like four, uh, tails of an airplane which kind of come -- kind of come together to form a new set of twins --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or a new set of twins, yeah --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so, like --
L:  What a great idea.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Right.
R:  Thank you very much, it's very simple and kind of, um, it looks kind of a bit like a temple or a -- a bit Mayan temple when you look at it from a structure standpoint, but it does look, it's very reminiscent of the air- of the tails of an airplane, so I don't think man can be afraid to fly, I don't think we can go backwards.
L:  No.
R:  You know, we --
L:  I don't think so, either.
R:  -- and I can't think that they'd, just because they used, uh, airplanes that we have to avoid, um, avoid them, or --
L:  Well, I know -- I know a lot of my friends aren't going because of that.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because they're afraid.
R:  Right.
L:  But I said, you've -- you know, if it's -- if something's going to happen, you don't -- it can be anywhere.
R:  It could be a bus, it could be a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I mean, you know, it could be food poisoning, you could choke on your chicken bone from dinner, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, it really -- it really --
L:  I mean, it's like living in, you know, if you live in Israel, or, in fact I talked to some people from England and they said they're used to it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because of the IRA --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're used to terror attacks.
R:  I kind of, um, I went to Israel in the year two thousand, I've travelled around a -- a -- a fairly deal myself and so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- uh, in -- in two thousand I think that the --the climate in Israel, you know, was hopeful at that point, they were seemingly, it seemed like they were, you know, on the way to getting some peace at that particular moment in space, and -- but at the same point when you talked about any type of terrorist attacks, they were so kind of used to it and took the same kind of notion, well, you know, if it happens, it happens, you know, there's not really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- much you can do.
L:  It's [LAUGH] there isn't anything you can do. [LAUGH]
R:  There isn't, [LAUGH] you know, I mean it's, like --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- "Okay, well, uh --"
L:  -- we --we'd hope that nothing happens, but --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- there isn't --
R:  -- really, there is no --
L:  -- anything you can do.
R:  -- duck and cover here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  There's no, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's certainly, like, no, you know, nothing we can do, except for the fact I think stay just more aware and I, um, you know, as an artist I kind of, I made -- I made a lot of -- a lot of work came out from that particular moment.  I think that, like, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I -- I made a, um, a mural the -- the night of September eleventh where I took the towers and I made them, um, and I used tape as one of my mediums --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I went to this green wall that's on, uh, fourteen years, uh, near Fourteenth Street, Greenwich Street and Horatio --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, I went to the wall and I took tape and I made the towers in tape and then I wrote, "Twins live longer than we" and then it kind of breaks up and goes off to the stars and -- and so that the idea was to actually take the towers and kind of, um, put them as a constellation or immortalize them.  So --
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  -- all that wouldn't be lost. Yeah --
L:  There's -- there's --
R:  -- so, I mean --
L:  -- been some beautiful things over the Internet and in the paper and all over, there's been some wonderful things and people --
R:  Yeah and many --
L:  -- have --
R:  -- it is, it's -- it's, like --
L:  -- devoted a lot --
R:  -- out of tragedy --
L:  -- of time.
R:  -- right.  Out of tragedy comes, um, sometimes beauty and not --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, you know, I mean, and -- and also pushes the envelope for all of us to understand things better and to -- to grieve and to, um, to grow.
L:  That's correct.
R:  You know, and I think that, like, um, I -- I don't know, the -- the families of nine eleven certainly --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- have, uh --
L:  -- that, I -- I don't even -- I ha- I try not to think about them because it's so sorrowful for everybody --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it was sorrowful for other people too.
R:  I think it's sor-
L:  You know?
R:  -- you know, also if you ever had, um, even if -- if, you know, death is death, no matter if somebody dies from, uh, t- you know, the tragedy of a terrorism or the tragedy of a heart attack --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that, like, you know, sometimes, um, it's still death and it doesn't --
L:  It is death.
R:  -- uh, it didn't -- how somebody dies is -- is really irrelevant when you lo- when loss, 'cause it's -- death is so finite.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I think if people who a- and all of us, uh, have to experience death at one point or another with someone we know and love.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, uh --
L:  Oh, I've been through that a few times, so --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  And it's hard.
R:  Yeah, it is, you know, um, and it's a -- but it's also a kinda, I think, a big lesson in life of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of, that we, um, you know --
L:  But I heard somebody say, uh, ha- "When I leave my life here, I go off with God", so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- what more could you ask than that?
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I -- I feel, well, I also feel like, uh, I -- I feel, mm, for me personally that I -- like I've already, if -- if something were to happen to me right now, if I got off this phone and -- and suddenly, or passed away, I feel like I've contributed to this world and I've -- I've done what I -- I've done what I could and done the best job I can at certain things in -- in giving and understanding and trying to grow and be, you know, and certainly make mistakes, as we all do, but, um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I think I'm --I'm happy of -- of who I've become and -- and, uh, fortun- and blessed, I feel blessed because of who I've become, you know --
L:  That's great.
R:  So --
L:  And it's a great feeling to feel like that.
R:  Yeah, it is, you know, I -- I think that at the same time, yeah I'm also eager. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean, I'm eager to -- I'm eager to do more, I'm eager to --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, I keep joking I'm an eager beaver, 'cause I'm --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just like, I have all these ideas that come out of, uh, I don't know where they come from, I think they come from this consciousness that we all share and -- and, uh --
L:  Uh-huh, huh.  I think it's just wonderful that people have these great i- great ideas, I wish I was more talented.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I'm sure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you are, I'm sure tha- tha- tha- that people just don't, you don't always know that you, or recognize them, that they're coming from within you or that, you know what I mean, that sometimes some people just get good at going, "Oh", and getting that out there or being --
L:  Yes, I know --
R:  -- able to verbalize --
L:  -- that.
R:  -- their ideas or being able to --
L:  I'm more of a poet kind of person.
R:  Are you?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  What -- what kind -- what kind of poetry do you write?
L:  Oh, just odd things.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Whatever comes into my mind, I hear all of a sudden will write something down.
R:  You know, if you just --
L:  But I guess my mother was too, so I guess I inherited it. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, just beautiful.
L:  I have a book of poems from her.
R:  Yes?
L:  Mm. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, well then, are you -- are -- are you going to, uh, make it a volume two to your book of poems and then it becomes kind of a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- familial thing, that's really nice.
L:  I- I'd left some, in case somebody wanted to read them sometime. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's just the sheer -- it's the sheer act of doing it and so whether or not they ever become, you know what I mean, like, you know, you don't have to be a poet to be a poet, you know --
L:  No --
R:  -- you could --
L:  -- I know --
R:  -- you could -- it's just the sheer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- act of -- of writing something that's coming from within.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that that's beautiful and especially that your -- your mother, um, had -- ha- had the same tradition, I think that's gorgeous.  I love words and stuff so, I'm -- I'm a fan of anybody who wants to write.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So am I. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yeah?  How many kids do you have?
L:  I have four.
R:  You have four? Okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How old?
R:  And -- one's a -- a music writer. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm. Oh, okay.
L:  So, I guess there's some artistry in the family. [LAUGH]
R:  There must be, absolutely. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, see, and you're -- you're a good conduit for that, obviously.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And you must have been someone who, you know, certainly instilled that, uh, into your children as well, so --
L:  Right.  And how many children do you have?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Are you married?
R:  Oh, no, no, no, I'm single, I'm, um, I'm thirty two, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  And, uh --
L:  Well, I'm a grandma, so --
R:  You're a grandma?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  How many grandchildren?
L:  Uh, four.
R:  Four.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, so, wow, four children, four grandchildren.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, you've gotten your hands full already, then.
L:  Uh-huh, well, they don't live around me, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't see them too much. [LAUGH]
R:  What part of North Carolina are you in?
L:  Um, m- the -- by Ashville.
R:  Okay, I -- I spent a summer in Topsail Island.
L:  Where?
R:  Topsail Island. [NOISE]
L:  I don't know what --
R:  Topsail Beach, it's like between Wilmington and --
L:  Oh, okay, it's on the other coast, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I spent -- that was, uh, I think that was the year before, was Andrew the big one that ...
