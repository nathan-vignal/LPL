R:  Hi, my name is Patty.
L:  Hi.  Patty Lees.
R:  I'm --
L:  Is your name Patty Lees?
R:  No.
L:  Oh okay, you sound just like my friend Patty.
R:  Oh really? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh for heavens sakes, I thought it could -- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- could be too big of a coincidence.
R:  [NOISE] How funny.  Yeah, it could be. [NOISE]
L:  My -- my name is Bonnie, Bonnie Jay[?].
R:  [NOISE] Oh okay, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.  You sound like you're from the south.
R:  Yes, I am [LAUGH], Florida.
L:  Florida.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm at the other end, I'm in California.
R:  Oh really, that's -- okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Uh, so --
L:  Well, health -- health and fitness --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is a very big deal around here.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it is here too, more and more every day.
L:  Is that right?  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- changing, huh?
R:  Act -- um, when the phone rang my husband and I were sitting here looking through a magazine from GNC, the vitamin store.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, talking about a new product that they have out.  We're talking about exercising along [NOISE] with using the product.
L:  And what is that product?
R:  Um -- um, it's actually called Total Lean [NOISE].
L:  Oh yes, I've heard of it.
R:  Have you?
L:  They've been advertising it on TV here.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Th- that's the first time I heard of it [NOISE].  I went in to get vitamins today and I saw the article and --
L:  Yeah, there's always --
R:  -- thought it'd be interesting. [NOISE]
L:  -- something new out there.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, there's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a million [NOISE] products every day and, of course, getting back to our topic, they all say that you have to exercise in addition to taking those products [LAUGH].
L:  Yes indeed.  So, I wonder if it's the exercise or the product?
R:  I often wonder myself. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I've taken a lot of those products.  I've never found any --
R:  Have you?
L:  -- of them to do any good for me.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I've [NOISE] found -- actually [NOISE] I take -- took, um, Metabolize [NOISE] going back a couple of years ago and that --
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah, that, um -- I had pretty good results [NOISE] with that.  I wasn't looking to lose a lot of weight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I also exercise, um, not -- not [NOISE] major exercise but just, um, [NOISE] walking like, um, ten, fifteen, twenty minutes a day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- along with taking that and then of course watching what I was eating [NOISE].
L:  Of course.
R:  And, um, that did -- it cut off a few pounds that I was looking to get rid of.
L:  Wonderful.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  You're very fortunate.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Now, I'm, um -- over the past probably six to eight months I've been using Slim Fast --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- along with, um, just a little bit of exercise, you know, like, um, um, um -- sorry, there was a bug crawling across my floor --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I didn't want the dog to get -- [LAUGH] um, [NOISE] a little bit of exercise along with that, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just basically walking, doing some sit ups, you know, and stuff like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but they do all say that you need to exercise along with taking their [NOISE] product.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... [NOISE]
L:  All of 'em, yeah.  All programs.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Well, my experience with exercise is I started in nineteen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, eight two --
R:  Uh-huh [NOISE].
L:  -- and have been exercising --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty consistently every since then.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And have done nothing but stay the same --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or gain weight.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And I -- my diet is really excellent.
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  I'm low fat, low carbohydrates --
R:  Really?
L:  -- I've given up white sugar, I've given up flour, I've given up all of my favorite grains, I've given up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nearly everything.
R:  Wow.
L:  And regardless of what I do --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- nothing changes.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  Nothing.
R:  Wow.
L:  I even joined a gym.  I had my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- treadmill here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was working on it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'd say over the last fifteen years, at least three days a week --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at least, if not five.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  And, um, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- joined a gym and had a trainer, worked out every day for the first month, six days a week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then every other day for the second month --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then three times a week for the third month.  Nothing happened.
R:  Mm.
L:  And that's with a trainer.
R:  Wow.
L:  Nothing.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I am just so disgusted.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't see any point in going on with it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Now, my husband [NOISE], um, he works out very faithfully.  He's somewhat of a body builder and he's basically trying to keep in shape and fit and [NOISE] he goes to the gym, uh, two or three nights a week and --
L:  He does?
R:  Yeah.  And sometimes if he can't make it to the gym because of this [NOISE] schedule he will [NOISE], um, workout at home.  He's got a workout bench and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, [NOISE] he -- you know, he doesn't so much do the, um, cardiovascular [NOISE] workouts but, you know, as far as muscle wise he does that [NOISE] he gets a workout several times a week.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, he [NOISE] -- he -- he's Italian and he eats a lot all day long [LAUGH].
L:  Really?
R:  And -- yeah, he -- but I guess because of his job he walks around all day so, um, he keeps fit like that and then on top of that working out at the gym that, uh, helps him keep his figure too.
L:  Well, he must enjoy the gym.  I hated it.
R:  Yeah, see I -- I never could really get into it myself but, no, he -- he does.  He loves it and he goes very religiously.
L:  Oh.
R:  And he has since the day I met him [LAUGH].
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  There's --
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  -- you know, a lot of people will go for a couple of months then they kinda get off the kick and then they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go back.  Not him, he goes three, four times a week.  The only time I've known him not to go was, um, a couple of times when he hurt his back or a couple of times when we were on vacation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the bath, let's go.  And, um, even at that, when we're on vacation we try to get into a hotel with a fitness center.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH] And he'll go to the fitness center and work out [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  Even we were on our honeymoon he went to, um, the -- we went to Jamaica and they had, uh, a little fitness room there and he worked out there a couple of times while we were there.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  So, yeah ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he -- he's devoted.  Well --
R:  He's dedicated.
L:  -- it's one thing if you do the work and you get some results --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's another thing if you do the work and nothing happens.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I definitely agree, um, going back several years ago I bought one of those machines off TV, the Body by Jake --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's supposed to be a bun and thigh rocker machine --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I seriously tried it for probably three months and I didn't notice any change.  But -- so, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what -- [SIGH] every one in a while --
L:  I --
R:  -- I go back to it but I never see any results so what's the point?
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly [NOISE].  That's how I feel about it.  And when I have worked out in my target zone, going the right speed and the right heartbeat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they say that you have endor- endorphins emitted from your brain.  I've never met one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, I -- exercise to me is just such -- such -- it's such a downer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's so much of a burden that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- and I'm exhausted after I do it.  I have to go take a nap.
R:  Yeah.  And see --
L:  This is not what it's supposed to do.
R:  Yeah, see that's what I don't understand too because people tell me that oh, if you hav- if you exercise regularly you have more energy.  Even my husband tells me that.  But I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the times that I've tried I don't see the change, I don't see an increase in exercise.
L:  Oh, I'm so glad to hear somebody else --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- says the same thing.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't know why I've done what I supposed to.  Other -- you know, I know a lot of people who, um -- get done fast -- a lot of people who go regularly or [NOISE] -- or even people that go -- you know, they go for a while and then they stop going --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then they go back and they say the same thing, you know, "Oh yeah, when I exercise I feel so much better but it's just hard to get to the gym this month" or, you know --
L:  Oh, I just dreaded it.  The agony --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of -- of getting up in the morning thinking, "Oh, today I've gotta go to the gym".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, "Today I have to go face the treadmill". 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I finally sold the treadmill [LAUGH] I just -- I had -- I needed the room for something else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I needed it for my office but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I wasn't sorry to see it go.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just got no benefit out of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All it did was make my legs ache.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I figure after, you know, eighteen or twenty years of doing that, it's enough.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  If it was gonna work it would have worked already.
R:  Yeah, really.  Huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, it's funny how different people, you know, feel differently about it.  Some it works so good for and, you know, some people can go to the gym or, you know, go jogging every day for a month and lose ten pounds and --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and other people can work out religiously and it -- the weight just doesn't come off.
L:  Mhm.  And one thing that annoys me particularly -- I'm in Santa Monica --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's like a body building mecca around here.
R:  Right.
L:  Gold's Gym is here and all the big places are here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Close to Hollywood.  If you don't look good --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're invisible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And for someone in -- at -- in my age bracket who is single it's very difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I'm more than my body but I never get a chance to prove it.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Very sad.
R:  Well -- yeah, that's true.  Uh --
L:  I heard in New England it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- different that --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, that -- that who you are counts for more than what you look like.
R:  Really, huh?
L:  Not here, not here.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I know even, um, a lot of people that I know are -- are like that they -- they look people and, like I said, I'm -- I'm only a few pounds overweight I -- I really don't have to lose weight but I just would prefer a flat stomach rather than a little bulge there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, people say it, you know, people have even said to me, "Boy, you've put on some weight lately". [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  How rude!
R:  And I'm like -- yeah, and -- and I only put on ten pounds, you know --
L:  That's terrible.
R:  -- [NOISE] so, yeah, it's like, "Well, gosh" you know, it's not like I've ballooned or anything [LAUGH].  But I guess with my body structure I was, you know, just perfect the way I was and then when people saw an increase of ten pounds it put a little bulge there and a little bulge there and -- and even I notice it when I look at my wedding pictures I can see where my face was real slender and thin and now it's a little more rounded.  But, uh --
L:  But it sounds like you have a child there? 
R:  Uh, I've got a couple of children, yeah.
L:  A couple.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  See, the -- when -- when women age that these --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are the thing that happen on- --
