L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, hi.  Ah, my name is Sharon.
R:  Hi, my name is Robyn.
L:  Oh, hi, Robyn.  Nice talking to you.  
R:  You too.  How are you tonight?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, doing okay. 
R:  G- good. 
L:  [MN] Um, they -- they say that the topic was, ah, health and fitness.
R:  Yes, about exercising.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you exercise regularly?
L:  Ah, well, I -- I started a program a couple of months back, but I only kept doing it for about a month.
R:  What was it?
L:  Oh, it was, ah, ah, what was it? [LIPSMACK] Walk -- oh, walk away the pounds.
R:  Oh, okay.  I --
L:  I don't know if you've seen that infomercial -- the video --
R:  No, I haven't --
L:  [MN] -- where you just walk in place?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh-huh.  And -- and you walk, ah, a mile in fifteen minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And you --
L:  It was --
R:  -- ju- --
L:  -- really good and -- and you end up you're sweating, perspiring and everything. 
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm. 
R:  How come you didn't stick with it?
L:  Well, I don't know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And even, I kept telling myself, because it was only fifteen minutes --
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and then, um, even in -- in the evening I said, "Well, let me just go ahead and put the tape on and, you know, get it over with".  And I was doing that regularly --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- and -- and then for some reason --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] the motivation. 
R:  Oh, no.  I'm -- I'm the same way.  I joined a gym about a year ago and it goes in spurts, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one week I can go about three times --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and then, you know, I'll keep up with that for a couple months and then I don't go for a couple of [LAUGH] weeks [LAUGH] and --
L:  Ah, what kind of machines were you using at the gym?
R:  I like the elliptical machines.  Have you ever seen that?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  You put your legs in and they just sort of swing back and forth.  It's really like that Gazelle thing that --
L:  Oh, that --
R:  -- was on --
L:  -- ad thing.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Wait, oh, with the bar and you're going back and forth.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  There's no --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- impact and it's --
L:  Ah, like the glider.
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Yeah, I really like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I do that and then I do some weights as well, like a little bit with the arms and legs, and every once in a while I'll go to a class, like a step class I like.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, yeah, it's definitely about motivation, getting myself to go. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, because in my, um, my apartment building we do have a gym.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  I think I've used it twice in the ten years I've been here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  I walk from the garage past the gym [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, there's your exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] to the elevator. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my first apartment complex had one and I guess now I look back and didn't take advantage of it, now I'm paying so much every month --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a gym membership. [LAUGH] 
L:  But it's probably, um, you probably like it being with -- with other people there. 
R:  I do.  Yeah.
L:  You know, like, when you're in there exercising and all.
R:  Yeah, and I've -- a lot of my co workers, um, belong to the gym too, so we, you know, we'll go there after work and it's -- it's -- it helps having other people -- going with them.
L:  Oh, yeah, especially if -- if -- if you can get it kinda, like, going on a regular --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- basis, you know, with -- with the people, then they can better kinda stick with it a little bit. 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I even bought one of those treadmills. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.  I -- I'm a -- Q.V.C. person.
R:  Oh, what's that?
L:  Do -- do you get that -- that TV show, Q.V.C.?
R:  Oh, I do get it.  I don't watch it very much, no, though.
L:  Oh, well, once you start watching it --
R:  Really? 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Every day. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I don't even go to the stores any more.
R:  Really? [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
R:  I do it, yeah, I do it online -- a whole lot of stuff too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, but the -- the, um, things that you do give them are a lot less because of the volume -- 
R:  Really?
L:  -- that they get.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, well, I didn't know that --
L:  And even the jewellery, I mean, you can get a, you know, twenty dollar, fifty dollar piece of jewellery that was regularly in the stores easy a hundred or more. 
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I didn't know that.  I didn't --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- realise that they had deals like that.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  I got this watch for my husband at Christmas time, um, it was a steel by designer gentlemen -- it -- that's his trademark --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it was fifty dollars, but easy one fifty in the store. 
R:  Wow.
L:  And they have designers that, um, design just for Q.V.C.  Norman Millar --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- Bill Blass --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- Joan Rivers.
R:  Yep.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, it's good to know.  I'll --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- check it out.
L:  'Cause then -- yeah, 'cause then you can get this stuff for, like, forty dollars and in the -- in their shop they're in the thousands. 
R:  Wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Good, I'm always --
L:  They got the movie stars calling them up on the TV to -- to order from them.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Suzanne Prechet[?] called. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  The one that used to be on Bob Newhart?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, she called up there and ordered.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm always looking for a deal.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Even win money.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but I had bought the treadmill from there.
R:  And that --
L:  And, um, it --
R:  -- that was a good deal?
L:  Mhm.  It was a one thirteen.
R:  Wow.
L:  And you can -- at that time you can pay it off in a, ah, three payments.  I think it was, like, thirty seven dollars a month.
R:  Wow, that's really cheap. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah. You know, on things they -- they have it spread out like that.  Whereas if you charge it on your card, you know, you're paying it off --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all that extra interest and all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or if you put it on layaway, you know, you got -- you don't have it, but you're still paying on it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But on -- on Q.V.C. they do, you know, five state -- monthly payments or three or two, or, you know, whatever. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Mm, you say, "Oh yeah, I can do thirteen dollars". 
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "I can handle that". 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, but it is thirteen dollars five times.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know, 'cause you didn't make [inaudible] so you might be twelve or fift- -- "Oh, yeah, I can do twenty, you know".
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] That's why at the end of the month, you know, you need a lot of those little ones.
R:  Do they have a lot of exercise equipment?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Especially the ones that they, um, have on TV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like the, ah, walk away the pounds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That one, you might see the infomercial, but on Q.V.C. they had other things that came with it that you wouldn't get if you bought it off TV. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Mhm.  Like the belt, you know, would come with it, or extra video or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it did -- they did -- they had that glider that you -- you like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they had that -- that there.
R:  Wow.
L:  All you had to do is just go online, ah, to Q.V.C. dot com --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and under the search you can just put, um, exercise equipment --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff'll come up.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, good.  Yeah, I don't know, I always thought about getting one, but I thought they were just a lot -- a lot of money, it just --
L:  Oh, no, yeah, mhm.
R:  Probably worth taking --
L:  Yeah, you --
R:  -- checking out.
L:  Yeah, check it out. 
R:  [LAUGH] Can, you know, stay at home and watch TV and exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, you just, you know, you just pull out your -- 'cause even with that -- that video --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I had, that I was talking about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, the music to it and everything, I mean, it -- it's -- it's really good, I mean, you would even want to, I mean, not to say that I'm not, but, you know, to let you know, if you do wanna get it, that it is really good and you would, you know, find it really, really good.  The music is really --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- upbeat.
R:  Oh, good, I like that.
L:  Mhm.  You'd be, you know,  marching along with it and everything.  It -- it's really good. 
R:  Oh, wow.  Interesting.  No, I've never heard of that.  That sounds very cool that one. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's called walk away the pounds. 
R:  Walk away the pounds.
L:  And you've got, um, four tapes, I think it was maybe thirty dollars, something like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, you got the exercise belt that you put around your waist and it has a -- the, ah, [LIPSMACK] the extensions -- the stretching extensions, so that you can do the resistance. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  You know, like -- like, the, ah, over the head, or you bring your arms over the head --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the, ah, with the stretching, mhm.
R:  And what does the belt do?
L:  Oh, well -- well, the belt is wrapped around your waist and then it has in each one of your hands, of -- instead of a bar bell, say --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you would -- and when it say, um, "Do your" -- you know, "Do your arms straight out" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, you would have that belt and when you stretch, it would be like a stretch --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- with the resistance with that belt. 
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  You know, it would be tight like -- like a rubber band.
R:  I see.  So it -- they have those that you put underneath your feet --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and then you lift up, so this is attached to the belt. 
L:  Yes, mhm.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so, um, when you do the exercises you could, um, do the stretching at the same time. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And so, like, when they do, like, the walking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so instead of just walking with your hands, you know, you can just be doing stretching. 
R:  Oh, that's a good idea. 
L:  To get the waist and that type of thing. 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] And then they have the one minute and then they have the t- -- the one minute regular and the one minute that's more vigorous --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then they have two minutes -- I mean, not one minute -- one mile --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- two mile and three mile.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh.
L:  So they have two one miles.  One is -- is kinda basic and one is more strenuous.  If you only have fifteen minutes, but you wanna more strenuous workout --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you would, [MN] ah, do that one.  Then they have the two mile and then the, ah, three.
R:  Ah, is anyone --
L:  And then, if you wanna do -- I'm not into the eating because I don't have to watch my weight, you know, myself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but say if a person wanted to -- with the kit is -- has, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, for every day for the month eating plan --
R:  Oh, really.
L:  -- with the recipe on the back of the card.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's regular food, like enchiladas, spaghetti, crepes --
R:  Really?
L:  -- but only prepared, you know, maybe without the fat.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  And substituting something else instead of cream or milk. 
R:  Oh, wow --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's a good idea. [PAUSE] Mm.  Yeah, it's good to incorporate the eating as well as the exercise, 'cause, you know, some people don't realise you gotta do both. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It's not just one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or the other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]
L:  Because a lot of time people just think that, um, if they don't eat then that's good, but then they don't realise, from what I've read, that your body starts to act like it's going into starvation mode and not using any energy.
R:  Right.  Oh, yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and it can --
L:  Yeah, so you're not burning a- --
R:  -- eat away at the muscle. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Instead of that fat. 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I don't have that problem. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No problem eating over here. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is this your first time doing the Fisher Project?
R:  Yeah, it is. 
L:  Oh, this is my second. 
R:  Is it?  Yeah, see, I've gotten a bunch of calls, I've just missed them all.
L:  Oh, and then I had put arou- around ten -- as- -- around six on mine.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And then both of mine had been around, ah, six ten and I'm in the California time.
R:  Okay.  I was going to say, you know, they're a little late, 'cause it's almost ten. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I'm over on the East Coast. 
L:  Oh, okay.  Mhm. 
R:  That's funny.  What was your topic the first time?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, um, [LIPSMACK] if you had to do what the --
