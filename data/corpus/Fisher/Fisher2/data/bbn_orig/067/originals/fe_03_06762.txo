L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name is Marie, I'm from Longwood, Florida.
R:  Hi, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm Sharon Brown and I'm, in, uh, the Baltimore, Maryland area.
L:  Oh, hi, Sharon.
R:  Hi, how --
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  You as well.  Um, I don't know if you're experienced with this, uh, I've only done one call, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] Same here, one call. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah, they just happened to catch me here, so.
L:  Oh, good.  Yeah, same thing, I was just doing some work here and the phone --
R:  Yeah, I -- I bet your weather is nicer than ours, but, uh --
L:  It's too hot.
R:  Oh, it's -- oh, too how?  Oh, well, you poor thing, it's -- we've had a cold rainy spring, but [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I suppose we should, uh, move on to the topic at hand.
L:  [MN] I g- actually --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I guess so.
R:  We -- we don't -- we don't want to, uh get in trouble here.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] so, um, how -- how do you feel you've changed your activities --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if at all since nine eleven.
L:  I don't know, I -- if I really have or not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, but I think I'm a little more vigilant just looking around [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and watching people and especially, n- n- not to sound prejudiced or anything like that, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, if I see a group of --
R:  [SIGH]  
L:  -- Muslims or people clad in clothes, you know, and hearing what the -- about the attacks over in Israel, you know, these --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- suicide bombers [SIGH] and a lot of them have been women --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with bombs, you know, I just am a little careful, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just watching and just staying a little bit [SIGH] -- you know, keeping my dist-
R:  A little bit paranoid. [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I'm paranoid. [LAUGH] 
R:  But yeah -- 
L:  It's the same [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN] I know, I don't meant that to -- yeah, I --
L:  No, I know what you mean.
R:  -- I -- I feel the same way, um, but, [SIGH] I think it's also made me, um -- [SIGH] I -- I don't feel truly different, but I do I think perhaps follow world events more closely --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- although I did it so in the past, now I have a different view of things [SIGH] --
L:  Really?  In what way?
R:  -- and I see things -- yeah, I -- in, you know, slightly different perspective in terms of how the rest of the world views us. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [LIPSMACK] and I -- I don't know that I'm any different with, you know, my family or friends or anything, if I -- I think, you know, I tired always to be appreciative of, you know -- [SIGH] of life and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even before the -- the nine eleven events, but um, I guess it does occasionally come to mind, you know, certain events, um, b- bring back, you know, thoughts of it and, you know, certainly it'll never go away entirely.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] it's hard to believe that we're only a few months away from the second anniversary.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, really, it -- I -- I [LAUGH] -- it seems like it just happened a few months ago, uh, you know.
L:  [SIGH] Well I -- it was a shock for me, I tell you.  I was -- [LIPSMACK] um, [SIGH] I'm from New York originally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and of course, you know, grew up there and [SIGH] uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the World Trade Centre, I just kind of took it for granted, it was always there.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  [SIGH] To going there and so forth, and I really hadn't been back in many years, but, just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of course seeing all the events on TV like everybody else --
R:  Right.
L:  -- had a -- [SIGH] you know, it of course had a shock effect and [SIGH] you know, it was very [SIGH] -- very traumatizing.  And I went back last year for the first time since eighty seven --
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  -- my husband and I took a trip.
R:  Oh, I really actually -- I wanted to do that as well.  My parents did, um, they went to the viewing platform and I would --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really like to do that at some point or actually h- to have already done so, but I -- you know, I just didn't have the opportunity, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] but, you know, I -- I have traveled to New York but only as -- as a tourist.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And actually I'm realizing one -- I wouldn't really call it an effect, but it just so happens I used to fly [SIGH] a lot of places as a kid, um, growing up, but I haven't done so, uh, since nine eleven and [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- it's not -- it's not that I'm afraid to fly, um, per se, although I would be a bit nervous, but, um, I just haven't had reason to and it's kind of interesting that [SIGH] you know there's -- ever since nine eleven I've not been on a plane and --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- now there are all those, um, [LIPSMACK] of course, security measures in place as a direct result of -- of that day, so [SIGH] that's something that affects all of us. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] This is true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Part of you still worry and, uh, this morning I just saw a fragment of the new book out about how to survive --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- terrorism --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I -- I forgot the exact title, but they interviewed the author [SIGH] who used --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to be with the Israeli security --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- and the, um [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, they know --
L:  -- c-
R:  -- what they're doing over there [LAUGH] in the army.
L:  Right, and the commentator said he really had nightmares after reading the book 'cause there's so many ways [SIGH] that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- terrorists could attack.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, it's not just -- they would go after Al Qaeda, but there are so many groups that hate us. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I know, it's -- it's -- it's truly scary, um, and I've -- I've actually traveled to Israel --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, when I was a teenager and it was a lot different there, of course, I never would [LAUGH] -- [SIGH] I never would go there now, nor, you know, would my parents have allowed me to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go at the time were it -- were it the same -- you know, were it as volatile as it is now.  But anyway, [SIGH] um, I went [MN] -- I'm -- I'm [LAUGH] a lot older now, so when I went, you know, it was still [SIGH] relatively calm --
R:  [SIGH]  
L:  -- but yet, [SIGH] you know, everywhere you went there was a lot of security and I -- I recall at the airports they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- did extreme, you know, [MN] even beyond the security levels now in our airports, they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they do even more, they interrogate you and [SIGH] you know, here I was this teenager, [MN] um, you know, assuming [LAUGH] I looked, you know, like I couldn't cause h- harm t anyone --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, uh -- but they're right to question everyone, like you said, because --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you never know, it could be a woman, it could be anyone.
L:  [SIGH] Right, right.  Did you -- did you go there on a vacation or to stay --
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  -- in a kibbutz or ...?
R:  -- I -- it was -- it was --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- both, I actually went with a group of -- of teenagers, they were -- um, we were all sixteen and, um, [SIGH] and I am Jewish and so --
L:  Me too.
R:  Oh, are you? [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, actually, um, s- um, I'll mention as an aside --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my father's a rabbi. [SIGH] He's a --
L:  No kidding, really?
R:  -- he -- yeah, he's a reform rabbi. [SIGH] Um, so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I took my trip, uh, uh, after my confirmation year with --
L:  Ask him if he knows, I don't mean to interrupt -- ask him if he knows --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Cantor Alvin Donald.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] From Baltimore.
R:  Yeah, no --
L:  He just --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, really?
L:  -- [SIGH] I -- [MN] well --
R:  Okay, w- [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- as a sideline, I do --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [MN] [SIGH] I have a part time [MN] job and I -- I'm a wedding photographer, part time, but I also --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- work for the government, but anyway [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, wait, you're kidding, I work for the same old government [LAUGH] myself.
L:  Do you?  What do -- what do the --
R:  [SIGH] I work for the US department of health and human services.  There is [SIGH] an agency here in Baltimore that administers the Medicare and Medicaid program. [LAUGH] 
L:  You're kidding, I work for social secure-
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- actually the disability program --
R:  Oh, you're --
L:  -- social security, disability.
R:  But, you're k- you're -- you're kidding, the headquarters of S.S.A. is just down the street --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from where I work.  It's on Security Boulevard where [LIPSMACK] -- that's incredible, and you're in --
L:  And, I'm a --
R:  -- Florida. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm a s- um, I'm a st- I'm -- actually,, I'm a state employee, I'm a supervisor --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but because the state -- the programs are actually administered by the state.
R:  Right, right, this is --
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, um --
R:  -- too -- uh, too funny. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, before anything, I'm going to give you my email, this would be funny --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Well I wrote down the -- the cantor's name.  Alvin Donald you said?
L:  Right, [inaudible] --
R:  Okay, I got that.
L:  [inaudible] at S.S.A. dot com. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay, very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  yeah, and I'm --
L:  And I'm sorry, what was your name again?
R:  Uh, Sharon Brown and I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm S. Brown four at, uh, C.M.S. dot H.S.S. dot gov.
L:  S. -- S. Brown four --
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] at C.M.S. [SIGH] --
R:  At C.M.S. dot --
L:  -- dot 
R:  --H.S.S. [SIGH] dot gov.
L:  isn't that funny.
R:  That is just too -- and here we are, like --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- oh, I don't know, a thousand miles apart --
L:  [SIGH] I know.
R:  -- and yet [LIPSMACK] we have so much in common an d--
L:  Isn't that funny, and the c- well the thing is that it -- make a long story shorter --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I shot a wedding Sunday and -- [SIGH] the b- the bride was his granddaughter, so he came down [SIGH] from Baltimore and he did the service.
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  yes, my dad has done a few of those for old family friends and such [SIGH] -- of -- you know, a few, uh, weddings and -- and all.  Um --
L:  And he's reform also, so --
R:  Oh, okay, very good.
L:  -- [MN] so that -- that's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- too funny.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um, anyway, I'm -- I'm trying to think if we had exhausted our topic or not.  It sometimes -- ten minutes --
L:  Nine eleven.
R:  -- [SIGH] ten -- ten minutes is either, you know, the longest or shortest amount of time depending on, you know, what --
L:  Right, listen --
R:  -- uh, you do with it, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, I tell you, I've been a little more vigilant, uh, being a supervisor and, [SIGH] uh, so forth, I sometime- I feel responsible, even though I'm, uh, sorta like a [MN] first level supervisor --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay. [SIGH] 
L:  -- but [SIGH] I still, uh, you know, if I see something about terrorism or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- world concern --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or just something in the paper or [SIGH] just something that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um [SIGH] --
R:  And I'm sure your -- your workplace as well as mine has -- has instituted new safety measures --
L:  Mhm, yeah --
R:  -- um [SIGH] --
L:  -- we have a lot of c- security. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, uh, we h- well, we have badges on the door, but we have a lot of security measures in place and --
R:  Yeah, I -- I feel actually lucky, I mean, I f- I feel safest actually at work, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just because there's federal police, protective service on site and --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I mean, they do bomb checks w- you know, if you drive in and you don't have your parking pass where I work.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH] And -- and, yeah, and actually, you know, as --as kind of scary as that is, but it's necessary I -- I really appreciate it, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Um, so -- and beside, you know, we're this little, um, [LIPSMACK] nameless, faceless agency, so, you know, I -- anyway I would think of us as a target --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- like, you know, the Pentagon or anything, but --
L:  Right, well, the same with us.  If they -- if they want to target social security, they're not going to target the disability office but we get a lot --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- of irate claimants and crazy claimants and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, uh, yeah, I bet you do.  In fact, my boss used to be in [SIGH] -- work in at S.S. A. in --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- the eligibility branch and he's told me stories. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Right, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, and so we don't even tell people where we are. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] What do you do for health and human services?
R:  Um, well, I work on the Medicaid and state children's health insurance programs.  I'm a -- [SIGH] I have a generic title, but I'm an analyst on financial policy.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But, I'm -- you know, I'm -- I'm pretty low level of course, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] um, but I've been there about six years, so 
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah, so, um, it -- go figure that -- I'm glad, you know, that I picked up 'cause this is the -- the --
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  -- a great conversation. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, I -- you know, y- there's a pause and then they say, [MN] one -- always one [MN] -- I almost hung up because every time there's a pause it's usually a telemarketer. [SIGH] but --
R:  Right, you know, exactly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I let the machine pick up. I -- I -- you know, I must admit, I screen calls because exactly for the same reason, I just, you know, -- it -- telemarketers are just too much, so, [SIGH] um, you know, I almost didn't pick up, but, uh -- but I'm glad that this is a --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes, me too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's a pleasure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Um, let's see, I'm trying to think what else would be with --
R:  I -- I kn-
