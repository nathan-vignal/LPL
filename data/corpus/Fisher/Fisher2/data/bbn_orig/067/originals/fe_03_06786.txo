L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, good evening.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, how are you?  My name's Josh.
L:  I am fine.  Uh, your, uh, your name is Jeff?
R:  Josh.
L:  Josh.  Hi, Josh, my name is Marcia.
R:  Nice to meet you, Marcia
L:  Nice to --
R:  Where are you?
L:  -- nice to meet you too.  Where am I?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, LA, and you?
R:  Uh, right near Washington DC, so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, wow.  This is great --
R:  [LAUGH] I --
L:  -- I -- I thought that, um, all of my calls wa- -- would be in the -- like the local area here --
R:  I talked to someone last night --
L:  -- in the LA -- in the LA area.
R:  -- from Kansas, so [MN]--
L:  From where?
R:  From Kansas, so --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- in the whole country.
L:  -- you know, that's inter- -- yeah, I know that -- that -- I th- -- I am aware that the -- the study is, um, na- nationwide, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I thought that, um, [SIGH] the calls that I make would be connected locally --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I was under that impression.  I -- I spoke to someone last night also, [SIGH] but I didn't ask him where he was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where he was from, I [LAUGH] -- I didn't.  Anyway, nice to talk to you, Josh.
R:  You too.
L:  Our topic -- our topic tonight is, uh, is, uh, nine eleven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have, uh, a sad topic. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, [MN] it's interesting, 'cause I actually live about, uh, half a mile from the Pentagon --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- so -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- wow.
R:  -- so, when they ask you what sort of changes you've made in your life since nine eleven --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- I -- [LAUGH] I --
L:  I -- I have --
R:  -- think I worry a lot more. [LAUGH]
L:  Y- y- you worry a lot more?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, well, could you tell me a little more about that?
R:  Well, uh, y- -- I moved to DC around, uh, nineteen ninety nine and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- things, you know, seemed pretty normal and calm and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then from two thousand one to now, first we had a plane fly into the Pentagon --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then, a month later we had the Anthrax scare [MN] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- and then about a year after that we had the entire sniper craze --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so [MN] --
L:  These times --
R:  -- I- I've pretty much come to the conclusion that, you know, there's not a whole lot that I could do differently to be safe because, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Do you s- --
R:  -- it could really be anywhere, you know?
L:  Do you travel?  Do you do a lot of travel, or moderate travelling, or ...?
R:  I wouldn't say I do a lot, uh -- I have flown some since September eleventh and --
L:  And how -- how do you feel about travelling, are you, um, anxious about that, or --
R:  I think, you know --
L:  -- just take it in stride, or --
R:  -- on -- on the hand, I feel a little more anxious because, you know, I know it could happen, on the other hand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I see all the security at the airports and that makes me feel a little more safer, so it kind of balances.
L:  Oh good.  So, h- -- you -- do you feel, um, [LIPSMACK] inconvenienced by -- by all the security or are you --
R:  Nah, --
L:  -- how do you feel --
R:  -- I --
L:  -- it makes you a bit safer, right?
R:  It -- it makes me feel definitely safer.
L:  Safer, but are you -- do you feel somewhat, um, incommoded by it too, or are you just taking it in stride and you're --
R:  You kind of --
L:  -- appreciate --
R:  -- have to --
L:  -- appreciate it because it makes you feel a bit safer?
R:  You kind of have to just sort of take everything in stride --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, you know, [MN] i- i- it really, if you think about it, it makes you feel very powerless --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so you just sort of have to keep going and try to continue --
L:  In as normal --
R:  -- whatever it is that you do -- yeah.
L:  -- a normal, um, a style as possible.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have -- have you seen a lot of, uh, changes in California --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- since September eleventh?
L:  Well, I haven't done any travelling for a long time, so I can't speak about that.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Just what I -- I try to keep up with the news, so basically what I know in terms of people's attitude to travelling, [SIGH] um, [MN] I learn from listening to the news or talking to some of my friends --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- who travel some times, [SIGH] but basically what I notice, um, I guess, what most people are aware of, [SIGH] is, um, the teri- -- the terrorist alerts and the -- the raising of the ter- --
R:  Right.
L:  -- terrorist alert.  Right now we're on, uh, elevated, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- level now, right -- orange?
R:  Orange --
L:  Orange.
R:  -- or bright orange or [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, and, um, I'm interested to see how people react -- if that makes, you know, they interview [SIGH] people on the, uh, news, like, people who were planning to travel for their holidays and so on -- ask them, "Well, does make you wanna change your plans for travelling or does this make you more anxious?"  Well, most people have been -- see, I don't know if they're just saying this because they're on TV [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or whatever what m- makes, you know, but most people say, um, [MN] that they're not afraid, that they're just gonna go about their business as usual and in general and in terms of the travelling, they're not gonna let that stop them [MN] --
R:  Interesting.
L:  -- from doing what they have to do [SIGH] and they say, like you do, did -- that, um, the security -- they feel that the authorities are, um, doing whatever they can to keep people safe, so that gives them some confidence.
R:  I- it's interesting, the first time, when they put --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in this new system, that they elevated it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think --
L:  Is this the second or third time?
R:  -- a lot of people -- I think this is the third or fourth.
L:  Fourth? [MN]
R:  Maybe third.  There w- -- there was one --
L:  Um, is it usually countrywide -- I think so, nationwide?
R:  Yeah, th- they've all been nationwide so far.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The first time it made me kind of nervous and I thought, you know, "Uh-oh, they must know something".
L:  'Cause you expected something to happen, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, why would they be doing this if they didn't expect something?  What aren't they telling us?
L:  Right.
R:  And then th- -- nothing happened and then --
L:  Which is good.
R:  -- the second time --
L:  Which is good. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's great, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if that's what they have to do to make sure nothing happens, you know --
L:  Of course.
R:  -- raise it any time you want, but, yeah --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the -- the second time, I think, especially with the war about to begin --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in Iraq --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I was [NOISE] a little bit, you know, concerned that maybe something would happen.  This time, I guess, it's kind of -- and I hope that this isn't the case with the, uh, police officers, but I kind of saw that and said, "Uh, you know, it's just another one".
L:  The police officers?
R:  Yeah, I- I- I-, you know, the people who actually are responsible for, you know, security, I hope they're not getting jaded the way I am.
L:  Oh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so you would say you're getting jaded?
R:  I- I- [MN] -- no, m- --
L:  In that you're --
R:  -- it kind of feels like old hat and it doesn't -- I -- I guess it doesn't make me all that much more alert than I would have been before --
L:  Oh, you know, that was, um -- that's, um, an interesting comment, because, um, [LIPSMACK] they raised that point on -- on the news, that, um, they wonder if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people will become --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- will ignore -- after a while, ignore the warning because the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it be like crying wolf, you know?  [SIGH] I hope they --
R:  Well, the only thing is --
L:  -- don't though because, I think, if they keep elevating the level and -- and -- and nothing happens, which we hope, that people should make a point of not, um, to use your term, becoming jade- -- become jaded.
R:  Exactly.
L:  It just -- it's just -- it might be tempting to do that, but just be alert.  When they -- when they raise the level, just be a little ex- -- not paranoid [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but just be a little more alert --
R:  That's such a tough --
L:  -- but -- but --
R:  -- line to walk, too.
L:  -- still pay attention.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm?
R:  It's such a tough line to walk.
L:  Right.  Pay attention --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- make a -- a little extra effort and be a little more vigilant or a little more alert, but never take it for granted and ignore it because then you might be in danger if you say, "Oh, another alert, this is just meaningless".
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, just be glad that -- I mean, y- -- the other opti- -- the other alternative is for something to happen and we don't want that --
R:  [MN] No, absolutely not.
L:  -- so, you know, never -- don't become jaded, just be glad something bad didn't happen that time around, and just be --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- alert every time, [MN] a little more alert but without being paranoid. [LAUGH]
R:  But, at the same time, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I try to be alert --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- even when we don't have the elevated warning, you know --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- I -- I mean, you know --
L:  You do?
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I try to be --
L:  You know, but sometimes I go to the, um, subway and I see, like, maybe like some strange looking package which not on -- maybe a bag or something that's sitting there and I don't see any one [SIGH] a- and normally in -- in normal times before September eleventh, I wouldn't pay any attention to that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'd be too --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I'd be just focussed on my -- my own business, [SIGH] but now I might notice -- but I wouldn't do anything, I- I've -- I was just sort of convince myself, "Oh, it's nothing".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, this is like in the normal time, when there's no alert, I'll just convince myself that it's nothing, but maybe that's not the right attitude.  So, maybe --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we do need those alerts, maybe they might [LIPSMACK] --
R:  I guess I just --
L:  -- make us a little bit more [LAUGH] --
R:  -- I guess it just states that --
L:  -- pay attention a little bit more.
R:  -- [MN] before September eleventh, I would have ignored it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and now I'll kind of look at it twice.
L:  Right.
