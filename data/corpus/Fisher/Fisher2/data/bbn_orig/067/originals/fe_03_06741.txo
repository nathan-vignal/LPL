R:  [NOISE] Hi, my name's Elizabeth. [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hi, Id- Idell. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Idell?
L:  Yeah, hi --
R:  [SIGH] Uh --
L:  -- hi Elizabeth. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Uh, are you in Washington?  I'm in Seattle, Washington.
L:  Oh, no, I'm actually in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
R:  [SIGH] Wow, that's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- really weird, that's [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's cool. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it is cool. [NOISE] 
L:  So, how is it over there? [SIGH] 
R:  Um, well, [MN] we've had s- it's been a real bad economy since nine eleven.  I worked [SIGH] at a hotel [NOISE] [SIGH] until December, I worked eight and a half years at the same hotel and [SIGH] they just started letting people go and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they let the younger people go [SIGH] [NOISE] and at some point [NOISE] they ran out of young people [NOISE] so they started on us older people, [NOISE] I'm sixty years old. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, dear.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Well, I -- I had the s- something similar to that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the essence of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I worked for a +furniture --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- store for four years --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, in August --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I got --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- m- forced to resign.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- but they were cutting everybody off --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and in fact --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- even those that are there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the few that are there, I mean, they let go off receptionists, the whole --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- nine yards.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- then, um, [LIPSMACK] cut --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- their hours down --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so they can't work --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- more than thirty two hours.
R:  [NOISE] So they can't get any benefits.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  And it's like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- w- and the -- and the girls that are on commission --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hiked up their, um, sales --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in order for them to get their bonuses to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- unreasonable --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- levels.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] And, you know, it's just like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Oh, my goodness".
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] It's all --
L:  But --
R:  -- over the country, it's just really --
L:  I- it is.
R:  -- [MN] [NOISE] hard to understand. [NOISE] 
L:  It is, it's very tough.
R:  [NOISE] Especially --
L:  It's very tough.
R:  -- since we all pulled together [NOISE] so quickly afterwards, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then [SIGH] -- and then now it's sort of like, uh, [NOISE] everyone just turning their back and not seeing anything else that's going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's really --
L:  Yeah, 'cause I'm doing sales right now and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and it's, um -- it's a tough one. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I got [NOISE] -- I don't think I could do that. [NOISE] I have -- [SIGH] I have emphysema so I'm trying to get [MN] --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- [inaudible] disability but [SIGH] that usually takes six months and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I've run out of 401K now, so --
L:  [MN] Yeah, like --
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's like, "Okay, what do I do next?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, my sister said, "Don't use that for rent" and I think, [NOISE] [SIGH] "Well, what am else and I going to do with it?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  [LAUGH] You know. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I love when they say, "Well you've been able to make --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- your payments for the past ten months" --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --"Yeah, well, I'm out of money now". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that 401K doesn't last that long --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [NOISE] when you're putting in --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it seems like it takes a long time, [NOISE] it comes b- out really quick. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [NOISE] But --
L:  When you think how --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- long it took you to put it in there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] But, yeah, th- that, um -- the nine eleven --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I know [SIGH] [MN] -- I don't know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, it's just been, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- unreal, I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Y- yeah.
L:  -- how well --
R:  -- it's like the [NOISE] --
L:  -- [SIGH] the -- the terrorists did more than just, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] 
R:  Bomb a building, they took --
L:  [MN] Bomb a building --
R:  -- [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  -- they really did --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] They took our identity.
L:  -- a number to the --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- to the whole society.
R:  They took our courage and -- and, w- I mean, we [NOISE] [SIGH] -- uh, it never occurred to me that something like that [NOISE] would ever happen and [NOISE] -- or you, um, either, I'm sure, it's just [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, yeah, I don't think any of us did.
R:  No. [NOISE] 
L:  And I think it was probably the first wake up call for us --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- in the essence of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with all our new technology --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and all the things that we can do that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, we're not this island that's away [LAUGH] from everybody --
R:  No.
L:  -- anymore.
R:  [SIGH] No, we're not --
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] [MN] 
L:  -- and so, yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and it's unfortunate too because --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- anyone who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you suspect that is of Arabic --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um --
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- nationality, you don't -- at least I find myself not wanting --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to, but you're thinking, "Well [LAUGH] --"
R:  You never know, you know.
L:  "-- do you like me or not?"  You know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, and you're --
L:  And I'm sure they probably --
R:  -- smiling, but --
L:  -- feel the same way. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I'm sure they do, they probably don't trust us anymore at all either, 'cause [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they -- even though they've lived her mo- probably most of 'em most of their lives, they [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- e- everyone's [NOISE] shunned them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so badly and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now with the --
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  -- Iraq [NOISE] war thing, that's just --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] it's never going to end for a week. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] 
L:  No, well --
R:  [SIGH] So --
L:  -- you know what, on memorial day --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at least here in my little --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- part of the town --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] um, I anticipated --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- more people to show up for the parade and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there was not.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I was really surprised with the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- war going on and everything that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- people would --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- come out and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and --
R:  We had quite a few --
L:  -- really show support.
R:  -- [NOISE] different smaller ones here in Seattle, 'cause it's pretty big and we [NOISE] had different parts doing different things. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Uh, the Chinese community and the Japanese community [NOISE] had, uh, [SIGH] quite big parades. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, for the [MN] time they fought in the wars [NOISE] and stuff, but [SIGH] not much at all, uh, it's deeper --
L:  No, the -- we didn't either, just -- [SIGH] we had the different --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- communities that did theirs, but --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  --I was like, "This is it?" [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I was really disappointed, you know, it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and of course those of us that were there, you know, we were clapping and -- and stuff --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and [SIGH] I think that made those that were participating --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- in the parade feel --
R:  Much ha-
L:  -- better.
R:  [NOISE] Much better, I'm sure they did. 
L:  Because they were like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "You know, there's hardly anybody out here".
R:  Yeah, why are we --
L:  And so --
R:  -- bothering?  No one even cares. [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That's such a shame 'cause people do care, it's just hard [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] sometimes it --
L:  Well, [inaudible] half the group is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- over in Iraq, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Or --
R:  Exactly and --
L:  -- are young families.
R:  -- they're still getting killed, that's just [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] unbelievable to me. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Uh, I -- I was reading about --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that Jessica Lynch in the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- thing the other day and [NOISE] [SIGH] how they -- the army [NOISE] just made a whole complete different story up [NOISE] than what a- really happened.
L:  Mm, well.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And that she [NOISE] -- you know, I thought, [NOISE] "Well, maybe we need the publicity but you -- not that bad".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I don't think we need to lie about it, [NOISE] it's bad enough as it is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- without making stories up.
L:  Yeah, and that's -- that's a sad case too --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because the poor thing'll --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- never be [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, she'll never have a private life --
L:  She'll ne-
R:  -- of her own.
L:  No, no.
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  and even with what --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- has taken place --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the memories will always be there --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- of what took place and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know -- and to be that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- young and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's like, "Oh, boy".
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  So yeah, but you're right --
R:  I can do --
L:  -- it's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] it's a -- you know, it's a case of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] she may want to change her name. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I couldn't -- I couldn't even imagine that kind of publicity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] For, you know, especially if it's when you least expect it. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Um [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- just not a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] not a neat thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because y- um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sometimes it could have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- adverse reactions to the --
R:  [NOISE] Very adverse --
L:  -- person that it --
R:  -- reaction w- yeah, [NOISE] yeah, when --
L:  Than it happened.
R:  -- when you [LAUGH] [NOISE] don't want anybody to know who you are especially, that kinda makes it [NOISE] [MN] hard, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] I think [NOISE] [MN] in my neighborhood, uh, [NOISE] we've kind of worked [NOISE] toward [MN] getting out of this hole and stuff.  We've [SIGH] -- um, some of my neighbors, we'll have m- um, monthly meetings now and get together and have coffee and talk about what we --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- need to do and [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, that makes a -- a heck of a difference.  We have so many homeless people here in Seattle that it's [NOISE] -- and I'm sure you do too, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everywhere [MN] and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I, um, I got an eviction notice this month, I -- my landlord's been wonderful about letting me stay, he's only given three [NOISE] [inaudible] notices [NOISE] [SIGH] but this month he gave me an eviction notice [SIGH] so --
L:  Mm. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- [SIGH] um, but I've almost go the money together, so I'm -- you know, I'm just working with different [NOISE] organizations and at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- different agencies and, [NOISE] [SIGH] uh, you'd be surprised how they come through to help you.
L:  They do.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  That's true, that's true.  I, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's [LAUGH] -- you just kind of shake your head and you think, "Oh, my gosh".
R:  Wow.
L:  You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  they didn't even know me, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I don't live in their area, I don't go to their church or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] and they just [MN] --
L:  But you're in need. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that is one of the things I guess we can say --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is great --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about this country, is that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we do --
R:  Yeah, I don't --
L:  -- know how to pull in when -- when --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- our neighbors are --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- having problems and --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- I think that's why --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we sere so quick to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- react to nine eleven.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was just kinda like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- no matter how many miles away --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we were, we wanted to do --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- something, whether --
R:  It was -- yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was giving blood or --
R:  R-
L:  -- sending money --
R:  It's happening to part of each one of us.
L:  -- or --
R:  [NOISE] It just became a part of each one of us that [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- and it wasn't the -- [NOISE] New York it was all of us. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, [NOISE] I love the mayor Giuliani, he just -- I thought he was just [NOISE] the greatest. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But --
L:  I think that's where you find your --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- your true test --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when -- when emergencies like that, you know, who can really handle --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- such --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and -- and so I think that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, that his true colors kinda came out.
R:  [NOISE] I think he did a wonderful job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  'Cause that would just be [SIGH] -- I couldn't imagine --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- being told. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, oh, no, I just, uh --
L:  You know, argh.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I know and -- and I -- I h- as I said, I have emphysema, I -- that's the last place on earth I would [MN] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I'm glad I wasn't there, I would not have been able to breath and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] [NOISE] been gone with everyone else.
L:  N- now, [MN] being in Seattle --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do you have any problems 'cause I know there's a lot of trees and -- and that?
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] Well, the trees don't bother me, it's the dust.  We have --
L:  The d- okay.
R:  -- so much construction here.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, they're building a new federal courthouse, they're building new apartment building around me and [SIGH] the dust is, uh [NOISE] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so I've had to go get a -- a -- a personal n- [NOISE] they're called nebulizers [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's where you breath a special medication. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] Um, and I had to get one of those to keep at home now [NOISE] because there's just --
L:  Mm
R:  -- [NOISE] so much going on that --
L:  Just to kinda help you --
R:  -- I can't breath. [NOISE] 
L:  -- keep your bronchials open.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Wow. [SIGH] Well, you know, that is one of the things I will have to say --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] um [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I find amazing with the nine eleven --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there still seems to be quite a bit of construction--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] going on.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  You know, we've got a ton of homes being built and new subdivisions --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it's like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] "Okay". [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Right, where are the jobs?
L:  [SIGH] "How is this happening?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, where are the jobs --
L:  [SIGH] And --
R:  -- for these people?
L:  -- y- you know, and it's like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and that's the thing I was thinking --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] "Okay, okay, [LAUGH] where are they coming from?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] So, yeah, so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, it -- it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is kind of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a funny thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'cause it does --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- kind a make me wonder --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sometimes why the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- economy seems so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- down.
R:  [NOISE] Well, we -- [NOISE] we have a strange [NOISE] thing going on here, we have a [NOISE] -- a m- multimillionaire who [NOISE] [MN] was part of the Microsoft thing and [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] he bought up most of the area in my [NOISE] -- in my area. [NOISE] I live in what they call Cascade. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And I -- n- now the mayor [NOISE] wants to build a [NOISE] three million dollar trolley line down through the middle of his property [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and we pay for it.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Yeah, and it's like, "W- well, I don't think so". [LAUGH] You know.
L:  Oh.
R:  [SIGH] We have people who, uh, have no food and, you know, --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- what do we need a trolley line for? [NOISE] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] So, there's a lot of controversy going [NOISE] on about that.
L:  Yeah, oh, I can imagine.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Well -- well, did you read in the paper about the young man who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- got ninety million --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- contract with --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Nike?
R:  Yes. [SIGH] 
L:  And --
R:  Thirteen years old.
L:  -- and I'm thinking, "You know what?"
R:  [NOISE] Um [NOISE] --
L:  "Uh, maybe Nike ought to be putting that money into the schools" [LAUGH] 
R:  Somewhere, yeah, and especially the schools.
L:  [LAUGH] I said, "I'm not buying their product". [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I can't afford it anyway.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I [MN] --
L:  No, and so --
R:  -- on my good days. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah.  I was just like, "Oh, my gosh". [SIGH] So it --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- it is interesting --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] I find --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] sometimes I question, you know, where --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- where is this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- money crunch that we're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] in and why, and is it really a result --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of nine eleven?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and where --
L:  You know.
R:  -- is the money 'cause it [MN] -- it suddenly --
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  -- it's there for Arab -- uh, for, [NOISE] uh, Iraq.
