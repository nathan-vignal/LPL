R:  Hello.
L:  Pamela. [NOISE]
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [NOISE]
R:  How are you?
L:  [NOISE] I'm good, how are you? [NOISE]
R:  I'm good.  Where are you calling from?
L:  [NOISE] Orlando, Florida. [NOISE]
R:  Oh okay.  I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had another call buddy from Florida.
L:  [NOISE] Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  [NOISE] Um, yes. [NOISE]
R:  Oh okay, so you know how it goes.
L:  [NOISE] Um, about food. [LAUGH] [NOISE] Not about this topic though. [NOISE]
R:  Oh okay.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, my name's Dianne, by the way.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Pam.
R:  Okay, Pam.
L:  [NOISE] Nice to meet you.
R:  And you.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It sounds like you've got a lot of kids in the background.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, TV. 
R:  Oh right.
L:  [NOISE] Just a two year old. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  So, but you don't need to exercise with a two year old.
L:  [NOISE] Um, sometimes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But, yeah, he keeps my hands full. [NOISE]
R:  I bet he does.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What else do you do for exercise?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I actually have [NOISE] Lesley Sands- Sandstone or Sanson, um, walk away the pounds video [NOISE] --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know if you are familiar [NOISE] with those.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, yeah, I do the one mile walk [NOISE] -- well, I used to do the [LAUGH] one mile walk, um, [LIPSMACK] like every other day and then I'd do the three mile walk once a week [NOISE] --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- [NOISE] but now I don't have time for [LAUGH] -- for that.  [NOISE] I usually get in about a mile -- the one mile walk, um, about two times a week.
R:  Oh my goodness --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you are so good.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH].
R:  I mean I -- I just painted out bathroom yesterday and I'm putting that down as exercise.
L:  [NOISE] Oh gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I ache everywhere.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I know how that is.
R:  I -- I think it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause when you exercise I don't know whether your mind is fit for it or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what but you sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you use different muscles, I think, is what it is.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I really like the [NOISE] walk away the pounds videos because they have you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- using [NOISE] like, a whole bunch of -- you know, all of your different muscles and they even have parts of it [NOISE] where you walk a s- a different way for like about thirty seconds [NOISE] that uses, um, more muscles on your inner thigh.
R:  But how --
L:  [NOISE] So, that's pretty cool. [NOISE]
R:  -- how does that work?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You -- you actually walk in the house?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, you basically just walk in place, uh -- um, can you give me one second --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- to lower the TV [LAUGH], one second. [NOISE] Okay, that's better. [LAUGH] Um, you just basically walk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in place but it -- it incorporates a lot of like arm movements and, um, uh, different -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like you step to the side a few times and different things like that and then, um, halfway through the video they have, um, [LIPSMACK] these balls that are filled with water and they act as the weights but they're really easy to hold and they're -- you know, if you drop 'em or something it's really soft.  So, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's basically how those videos work.
R:  So, how do you know when you've walked a mile?
L:  Um, at the bottom of the screen it has --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like the warm up is like a quarter of a mile and so at the end of the warm up a little thing comes on the bottom of the screen and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it has a quarter of a mile, a half a mile, um, I think three quarters of a mile and then a mile and it tells you where you're at.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  And so it's really cool because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, every few minutes it's letting you know your progress.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause if -- if people are walking at different speeds --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just can't understand how they can --
L:  [NOISE] Well, it -- it shows, like, on the video, when you watch the video, you basically just try to keep up with them.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like, if you keep up with the speed that they're at then [LAUGH] you're there.
R:  Okay, no 'cause I -- see I wouldn't.
L:  Oh [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Not for want of trying [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd have to hit the water bottle, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, y- well, you know, there's the pause button [LAUGH] that's the beauty of it.
R:  There's a pau- yeah, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's very true.
L:  Um, I also own a couple of the Richard Simmons [LAUGH] videos.
R:  I didn't know anybody admitted to doing that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I usually do.  That -- they are like, you know, kinda hidden [LAUGH].  I don't really, like, brag about sweating to the oldies but I -- it's actually pretty fun.
R:  I think anything you do, though, would be fun, wouldn't it?  You know, if -- if you're actually doing it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have anybody you do it with for motivation or you just decide that that's it and you're gonna do it?
L:  Um, sometimes my sister does it with me but usually I'm on my o- [LAUGH] I'm on my own. [LAUGH] So, um -- but usually how -- how, like, I motivate myself to do it is throughout the day if I've had, like, a cookie or [LAUGH], like, an extra little treat, you know, that I normally wouldn't have then I'll say, "All right, I'll -- [NOISE] I can finish eating this brownie or this piece of cake or whatever but tonight I have to do -- you know, workout". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh okay.  Do -- because see I -- I do so- walking to me I can't do.  I mean, not that I can't it's just that I choose not to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, mainly 'cause it's boring.  Or I -- I find it boring.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I -- I don't like -- like, walking around my neighborhood or something.  I don't really -- I, you know, take, um, my son on a walk, uh, usually a few times a week 'cause he likes that but, um, I personally don't like walking around outside and -- I don't know why.  I get more sweaty, you know, the -- I live in Florida so, of course --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's al- always hot and humid.  And, um, it's -- you know, you kinda don't want, uh, all your neighbors seeing ya like trying to workout [LAUGH].  And so, I don't know.  And it does get kind of boring.  But the videos for me personally they keep me entertained to a certain degree.
R:  [NOISE] See I like, um, doing things like tennis and stuff like that.
L:  Oh yeah.  Um, I -- I play golf with my father sometimes.  So, I'm not very good at it but, you know, I guess that's exercise.  I've never actually played tennis before [NOISE].
R:  Oh okay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no well I -- I enjoy that sort of thing 'cause I don't realize I'm exercising.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're not setting out to exercise --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're setting out to have a game of tennis.
L:  And -- yeah, and to have fun.
R:  And then you go and undo all the hard work afterwards --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause you [LAUGH] -- you go and hav- it's hot, you're hot --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- so you go and have a drink, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Or something.  Um, which is probably not the best thing to do but --
L:  [LAUGH] But it works.
R:  It -- it works for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I guess it's better than not getting out and doing anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I think we all generally -- you've gotta do something 'cause otherwise you -- you just sort of jump in your car and -- and a lot of people I know jump in their -- their car to go and do something healthy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they could probably [LAUGH] walk there.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
R:  I'm just going to the gym.  Yeah, it's only, you know, three hundred yards away.
L:  Yeah, I'll --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- I'll, you know, admit to that.  There's a park in the back of the neighborhood [LAUGH] and sometimes instead of just walking there to bring my son to the park, we drive [LAUGH].  And --
R:  Well, my --
L:  -- it's just like, you know, a few blocks away so I -- I'm guilty of that [LAUGH] myself.
R:  I -- I think we all are.  I mean my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my daughter, um, takes the car to walk the dog.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, she will actually walk the dog but she'll take the car to take him to --
L:  To -- yeah, to, like, the dog park or something.
R:  Yeah.  And I sort of say, "It's sort of defeating the purpose a little bit".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not so much for her but for him --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but [SIGH] who am I to say.  But, um, no I -- I say -- this is a terrible subject for me 'cause exercise is not that close to my heart.
L:  Well, mine neither.
R:  I, um --
L:  I seem to fit it in but, [LIPSMACK] you know, it's not my favorite thing in the world.
R:  I mean, I -- I sort of feel I -- I get a lot of exercise just with the day to day running around that I do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and, um, I do quite a lot of physical stuff anyway, um, and I work on a film set a lot of the time so you're often out -- out and about and actually walking and snapping[?] stuff and, you know, sometimes running, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that you're not holding people up.  Um, so -- or admittedly it's short concentrated bursts of [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as opposed to, you know, a couple of hours but there's the other thing of going to gym, a it's the discipline which I -- I have to admit I don't have --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and b it's -- it's the fact that, um, most of the people who I seem to -- in my area that seem to go to the gym, don't need to be there.
L:  Yes, yes, exactly.
R:  You know, [LAUGH] you just look at them and go, "Why are you here?"
L:  I got a trial membership to the gym by my house and it was, um, for a month free trial --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- so I figured I'd go but I knew that I wasn't gonna buy a membership there because I -- you know, I'm not even gonna kid myself I know I'm never gonna make it out there.  But so I went once and -- well, the first time I went it was, um, during the day, it was, like, early afternoon and so there was ...
