R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Cindy.
L:  My name's Louise.
R:  Hi, I'm Cindy.
L:  Hi, Cindy, how --
R:  How --
L:  -- are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Where do you live?
R:  In Pennsylvania.
L:  Where.
R:  L- uh, like, Wihai[?] County, [NOISE] near Allentown. [NOISE] 
L:  Is it -- is that central or eastern?
R:  Eastern.
L:  Easter.  I live in Cleveland.
R:  [SIGH] So, pretty close to the September eleventh deal. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] You do, yeah.  How close?
R:  Um, [SIGH] actually, it's about three hours.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, not -- not too far.  A little too close to home. [SIGH] 
L:  Have you been to New York since then?
R:  No. [SIGH] [NOISE] No. [SIGH] No, my kids learnt  -- well, pretty much about it at school. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, they -- I think the biggest impact was them with school.
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  Um, thirteen and fifteen.
L:  And --
R:  And -- but the security measures at school and stuff I think scared --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a -- you know, a lot --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of the kids around here.
L:  Has it -- has it changed for them at their school?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, in the beginning it did. [SIGH] Yeah, like, there was always [MN] the method of, [MN] you know, how they would handle a nuclear, [SIGH] you know, problem and stuff like that, but it's actually been quiet now.  I mean, it was to the point where we were getting letters sent home on, [SIGH] you know, how to handle it and what to do --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and [SIGH] where your child would be if something would happen and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- you know, it was pretty hairy there for a while, but [SIGH] --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh --
R:  -- big impact on everyone, I think.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] [MN] so, do you -- do you feel like there's been an ongoing impact, you know, for your kids?  Do you think they've adjusted to the change?  Do you think it affected them over the long term? [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Uh, I [MN] -- I don't think it's something they'll ever forget.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it -- I don't think it changes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- their everyday life, but --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] I think it's something that, you know, they're never going to forget.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  I mean it was a big thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I mean, the schools, I think, actually made it even worse, you know, 'cause they put that extra scare into 'em also.
L:  Mm, that it could --
R:  You know.
L:  -- happen to them in their neighborhood?
R:  Right, right, and their school, and, [SIGH] "This is what we're going to do in a disaster plan" and, [SIGH] you know, it's hard enough having to talk to your kids about it normally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and then to have to answer the questions from the school, yeah, it's even worse.
L:  [SIGH] So you think that made you more frightened because of how the school handled it?
R:  Probably, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think it had a big impact of a lot of parents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know, they just [NOISE] -- they didn't let it go, you know, for a while, it was [MN] a continuous thing. [SIGH] But it has [MN] definitely calmed down some.
L:  Do your kids ask you about it any more at all?
R:  [SIGH] Well, they -- actually they still [MN] discuss it in school, but not as far as, like, a disaster plan.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, but -- you know, as for the everyday event, [SIGH] you know, how it happened and why it happened [NOISE] and, you know, they follow the news and stuff [NOISE] in school every day. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] So -- and, you know, there's -- I don't think there's a day that goes by in the news where it's not brought up. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think, pretty much [NOISE] -- you know, they're still pretty much on top of it.  They probably know more about it than I do now.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they could probably [NOISE] tell me a thing or two. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what about -- do you have children? [NOISE] 
L:  No, I have no children, and I think that, uh, I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do agree with you, I think having kids [SIGH] -- [MN] you have to face your own fears and their fears when you have kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because you have to talk to 'em about it.  When --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you don't have kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] you can either have your fears or squelch your own --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fears, you don't have to deal with it as much, but [SIGH] I did even around that time start thinking, [SIGH] you know, should we be having water and tuna fish and this --
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- in our house?  What's going to happen and what's our plan and --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, would we want -- like, just gather our family together --
R:  [SIGH] One of my --
L:  -- and kill ourselves if we're going to be exposed to something and have a slow death or what, so it's starting this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- p- planning [SIGH] you know, to end your life if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you needed to do that.
R:  Right.
L:  A- and then feeling like, is that over reacting and then thinking --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- no, it doesn't seem like it's over reacting, but who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- knows?
R:  Right, a friend of mine, she went and bought, like, [SIGH] fifty gallons of water and [SIGH] all these canned [NOISE] foods, and, I mean, [NOISE] she was just ready. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] She was ready, no mater what. [NOISE] The duct tape, the plastic [NOISE] and [LAUGH] I said to her, you know, if it's going to happen, that's not going to prevent [NOISE] anything.
L:  Right.
R:  That's not going to stop anything.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if it was meant to happens, it's -- it's going to happen [NOISE] no matter --
L:  To -- to --
R:  -- what.
L:  -- some extent, but I think [SIGH] -- I mean, I think [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it is possible that you could be at the edge of a -- of a -- some kind of a danger zone where --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, if you're not -- if something strange were to happen --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or, you know, we --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- w- or [SIGH] all of our water supply, or some other supplies were damaged that you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, life could become --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] complicated.  I was visiting a friend in Florida and, um, w- we didn't -- and the water system was, um, contaminated --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- somehow [SIGH] and so we had to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- boil water and not use the water just for a day --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it was amazing how much --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it impacted our life and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- what a pain it was and how much water you really need to boil when you use it for everything and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] it really -- I mean, it t-
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- it took a lot of time [LAUGH] and --
R:  [SIGH] All the things we take for granted.
L:  Yeah, and th- that was -- that was because we had electricity --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or gas and what if you also didn't have that and couldn't boil your water, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  Right, it's --
L:  So --
R:  -- yeah, it's definitely -- [SIGH] well, I mean, she did, like, the plastic and the duct tape and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I said to her, you know, getting the water and the canned foods i- you know, is one thing, but if it's something nuclear, [SIGH] uh, duct tape and plastic, what's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- unless --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you seal off your whole entire house, [SIGH] and it's going to take a little more [LAUGH] than duct tape.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] You know, I think it was just everybody was doing it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, the g- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] you know, the gas masks, I mean, everybody and their brother was going out buying those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and it's like, [SIGH] "For what?  You'll be the only people left.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If it does happen, you're going the [MN] survivors that there are.
L:  Yeah, and, too --
R:  Because it's -- it's not going to be [SIGH] -- you know, 'cause I mean the rest of the world doesn't have them. [NOISE] 
L:  And, too -- and who wants to be the only one left, but [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- um, did you ever see the movie, that Kevin Costner movie --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the -- was it the postman?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it was that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you see that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it was kind of interesting to think about what -- I mean, that movie --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was upsetting, but it was also fascinating in a way just to see how -- who survived and how people do it and how they live and -- I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah, it would definitely be -- I mean, if it was something nuclear, it would definitely be a whole change of life really quick.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Quickly.  I think people -- people take for granted what we do have and how we get it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's -- if -- even if they were just to contaminate our water --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- that would be bad enough.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, even without anything nuclear, you know, just damaging our water.
L:  Just that, oh yeah.  w- it would be devastating.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that would affect everybody.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  And what could you do about, really?
L:  Nothing.  And hope that the water that we buy or water that we get really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is some special water.  I often kinda wonder [LAUGH] about that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I mean, you almost have to wonder, like, even if they were to -- like, where they would get the spring water and stuff from [SIGH] you know --
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  -- [MN] [SIGH] what would you do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, if it was going to damage all our water everywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All those things we took for granted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would be gone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cooking would be hard. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, dr- you know, drinking, I mean, I only drink -- [SIGH] I don't really drink anything else, pop or even juice much, I just really drink water or tea or -- [SIGH] or a coffee --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so all of that is just water.  I mean, if I had to go back even to drinking --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, pop and stuff, I don't even like -- like it any more, so that would be really weird.
R:  Right.
L:  But --
R:  I drink a lot of coffee.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And cof-
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Coffee's a big thing for me.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I drink it all day long.
L:  Really? [LAUGH]   Yeah.
R:  So, thank god September ele- and I think it's pr- I -- I -- I don't think it's over.
L:  Yeah, I don't either.
R:  No.
L:  You know, I was just -- [SIGH] I forgot, when I asked you if you had been to New York, because [SIGH] I went to New York last month, and before I went --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I was wondering -- I went -- was on a business trip, whether I would have time to go to [SIGH] ground zero and then I kind of forgot about it and I forgot --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when I was there. [SIGH] No one brought it up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- no one suggested going, no one even said anything about September eleventh, and I [SIGH] just remembered that now.  It wasn't like, on our radar screen at all.  So, none of the New Yorkers brought it up either.
R:  It's like they don't care.
L:  [SIGH] I don't think that's true.  I don't think that they don't care, but I think maybe --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- everyone wants to block it out, it's so --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- painful.
R:  I think the younger generation -- I don't think they know the impact that it really made.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- the world itself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I th- I mean, [SIGH] [MN] the -- even --
L:  W- and what do you consider --
R:  -- people running --
L:  -- [MN] 
R:  -- around with jokes about September eleventh.  Like, there's no humor in September eleventh --
L:  No.
R:  -- whatsoever, [SIGH] you know, not with all the lives that were lost, there's just no --
L:  No, there's nothing.  Oh, my g-
R:  And, you know, [MN] I mean, they -- my kids came home, you know, saying they heard this at school and that at school and there's all these --
L:  Jokes?
R:  -- jokes going around and, [SIGH] you know, I -- like, I didn't find it amusing.  And actually I don't -- my kids didn't either. [SIGH] Like, there was a lot of lives lost, [LIPSMACK] and I think it made an impact with them.  We used to live in a funeral home [SIGH] so they've had -- they dealt with death every day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, I think that made a big difference [SIGH] because they were brought up; around it.
L:  Uh-huh, so they're more co- are they comfortable with it to some -- some level?
R:  [SIGH] Um, you know, I think they are in a natural surrounding --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] but because of the extent [NOISE] of what it was [NOISE] and how it [NOISE] happened, [NOISE] I don't think, [SIGH] um --
L:  W- no one could be comfortable with -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- with how that happened and the violence of it.
R:  Right. [SIGH] Yeah, I mean, and you know, the thing that was -- we weren't prepared.  Nobody was prepared for what was going to happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they really caught us off guard.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, you know, no matter what they do, they could do nothing worse to us than they already did. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because now, at least, if they do something, we're -- I mean, we're pretty much waiting for it now. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but [NOISE] to do what they did then, at that time [NOISE] and we -- we -- we were clueless. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, we really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was like a loss of innocence --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- definitely.
R:  Right. [NOISE] Oh, y- they have this thing going around online to light a candle.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and whatever state you were from, it -- you would click with the candle and it made that state brighter. [SIGH] And it was amazing, because you would think that more the -- the northeast would have been, like, the brightest.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] You know, and, I mean, it was very bright, [SIGH] you know, on the -- on this candle map of the northeast, but [SIGH] it was amazing how all the other states were too.
