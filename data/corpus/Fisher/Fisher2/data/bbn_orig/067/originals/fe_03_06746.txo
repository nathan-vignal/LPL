L:  [SIGH] Arielle Solaff.  Um, I've not made many changes in my life after September eleventh, [SIGH] um, except that our country has become [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- v- um, very obsessed with the war and [MN] more [MN] obsessive attacking other countries, which is the reason September eleventh happened in the first place, [SIGH] so therefore I have to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think more about, um, other countries and -- or think about [SIGH] the American people and their opinions [SIGH] of September eleventh and talk a lot to other people [SIGH] about what I think about September eleventh [SIGH] and I think [SIGH] that I'm not scared of terrorism at all [SIGH] the [LAUGH] only terrorism [LIPSMACK] is the terrorism inflicted by governments and other people [SIGH] that [MN] -- all over -- people every day across the world get bombed and personally- you know, this whole war in Iraq that meant, like, [SIGH] thousands of people died and they got bombed and all their buildings got destroyed and their infrastructure and their water and [SIGH] -- and before the war, like [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- thousands of people died because of sanctions and that would be, like, almost [MN] every month that many people would die, [SIGH] and so it just seem kind of ridiculous to make this big deal about September eleventh, [SIGH] when that's how many died in so many places around the world at least every month, [SIGH] whereas that only happened [SIGH] -- it was, like, a second atrocity on US soil as they call it, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] after [MN] Hiroshima. [SIGH] And it seems pretty silly to me that, um, [SIGH] people can't understand where it comes from [SIGH] and they always say, [SIGH] "Why do they hate us?" [SIGH] And, so, that's something changed my life, I have to tell people why they hate us [SIGH] because it's really obvious why they hate us [SIGH] because the US thinks that they need to police the world [SIGH] and control the world [SIGH] and have [MN] big corporations like Betel and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- oil -- hello -- oil corporations move in [SIGH] and they will all, [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH], you know, make profits off of, like, the backs of people in other countries [SIGH] and then the US will get all this money from it. [SIGH] And the people's [SIGH] lives are ruined by it.  So, [SIGH] I guess that would be a reason that, you know, people in other countries might hate us, [SIGH] and, um, the same -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- maybe another reason they would hate us is because we blindly hate them, [SIGH] is that, you know, people in this country just think, "Oh, oh, oh, the [SIGH] September eleventh attacks were, you know, carried out by [SIGH] -- by Arab terrorists, therefore all Arab people must be terrorists".  And then, [SIGH] if they think we think all t- Arab people are terrorists then they will often not like us --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for not liking them. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] So, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] also, I guess other ways, um -- yeah, [SIGH] so, in my life compared to September eleventh, [SIGH] hardly anything changed except, um, protesting the war and, [SIGH] um, yeah, in general [SIGH] -- I know another thing.  When I was visiting New York, [SIGH] it smells really bad, [LAUGH] 'cause those buildings that were w- way too tall for -- [SIGH] for anyone.  They don't need tall buildings like that. [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hello -- where, um, [SIGH] the air was really toxic and I would smell the air [SIGH] and I'd ride my bike and I couldn't breath, so therefore I would have to wear masks, so that was kind of a big change, and [SIGH] -- and when I was outside, I just always kind of felt --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yucky, [SIGH] and so, I think was -- but as time went on that changed, [SIGH] and, you know, other things changed, like if I was near [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ground zero in New York or something I would have to take a different route 'cause it was closed off and [SIGH] things changed for other people I know more.  People tell me that lived in the town at the time that it actually brought New Yorkers together a lot, that people [SIGH] -- people seemed to, you know, respect their neighbors more and talk to each other more and especially when down town was closed to cars.  They said that was the greatest time ever, because that was like, you know, when people could actually talk to their neighbors and hang out outside instead of [SIGH] cars just ruining their neighborhood and coming through the streets, [SIGH] and, uh -- [LIPSMACK] yeah, so that's -- [SIGH] this is a hard question because [SIGH] it doesn't really change my life. [SIGH] I think I've said this already, [SIGH] but, you know, it's hard to talk about how [SIGH] something would change your life if it hasn't.  Um, the Iraq war changed my life war more and made me really upset and I felt really horrible about it and [SIGH] also it made me really upset that there's millions of people around the world protest such dumb things, [SIGH] yet it doesn't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- do anything because, [SIGH] our [SIGH] -- not my president, but that president who thinks he's my president, has this really big ego and he thinks that he can do things, and he doesn't listen to anyone --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] so, you know, he thinks, "Hey, I could go and attack other countries --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- and I don't --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- care if other people don't want to, [LIPSMACK] but, I'll -- you know, I'll just keep doing it". 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] And, um, so, I guess in -- in some ways September eleventh makes -- maybe makes me feel [SIGH] incapacitated, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that we don't have the power to tell [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- didn't -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- tha the people that have the power to change things that our government just keep acting the way they want [SIGH] and all just fine in the name of September eleventh and, um, I guess I see lots more flags.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  That's something that changes, you know, 'cause you -- things you see change your life, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- there's always a lot of flags.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there didn't used to be so many flags before [SIGH] and, um [SIGH] -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know.  It seems [SIGH] odd that there's so many questions about September eleventh and, um [LIPSMACK] -- anyways, um, let's see. [LIPSMACK] I must talk more about this still. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um, Septem-
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- oh, other things that have changed in my life.  Oh, I think -- [SIGH] I think gas prices went up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- after September eleventh and people always --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] keep talking about the economy --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and, um -- so, that's, like, another things, 'cause people are always justifying, you know, [SIGH] all these, like, cut backs, and it seems like all of a sudden our country doesn't have any money for things, like [SIGH] they're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- cutting all the funding for libraries [SIGH] and they're cutting all the funding for buses and that severely affects my life, you know, because people [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ride buses and -- and you know, and I ride --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a bus sometimes and now --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the bus service is going to be cut and [SIGH] so is, um, [LIPSMACK] like, libraries are really great and they're going to cut all the money [SIGH] for libraries, and, um, it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that seems pretty ridiculous and yet they spend, like, millions of dollars each day --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on war, and now, like [SIGH] and -- oh, here's another [MN] -- another thing, it's the -- the Patriot Act which they [SIGH] enacted --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- after September eleventh, that cha- that, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is a complete breach of civil liberties and therefore, [SIGH] um [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my -- I -- my life is changed because I can be scared that police will just raid my house or anyone else's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- house in --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- America at any time for no reason.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] 
L:  And, um [SIGH] [NOISE] -- and that they're, [NOISE] you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that that is legal under the Patriot Act and that, like, the Patriot Act has given them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- all these kind of, like, uh, big brother kind of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- responsibilities, or, [LAUGH] um, [SIGH] legalities --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] let's see, [SIGH] what else?  Um, [SIGH] and that they, like, created all these new [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --um, homeland security, you know, taskforce and -- oh, and then they --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they changed [SIGH] -- they changed governors --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- Tom -- Tom Ridge can be, uh [SIGH] -- our new governor.  So, Tom Ridge --
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  -- could be then--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- homeland security, um, head --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and then he can come an speak --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- places about how great homeland security is [NOISE] and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and even though --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- very similar to racial purity --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's just, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "If you are not --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- white, you might be a terrorist". [SIGH] And that they made airports --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- oh, yeah, when I go to airports --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they're like, really, really super strict.  It seems [NOISE] [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  Well, me, myself, I don't -- [SIGH] I don't hate anyone.  I was raised to love, you know, mankind, anyone, um, [LIPSMACK] I notice too that a lot of the people have came here from over [NOISE] in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- New York.  They've came here from Iraq, you know, and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I think it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm very sentimental --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I think that [NOISE] it really saddened my heart to know how [NOISE] those --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- people there [NOISE] were living and [SIGH] how they, you know, were getting along [NOISE] there.  I mean, in poverty [NOISE] and a little bit of nothing and to have someone like, +Saddam Hussein, you know, that -- that was just terrible, him and his sons.  I could -- you know, it was unbelievable [SIGH] to know there are people in the [NOISE] world that actually live [NOISE] like that and so much [NOISE] in fear. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Um, I don't -- [SIGH] as far as the September eleven thing, I thought that was very sad too, because a lot of innocent [NOISE] people [NOISE] lost their lives [SIGH] and I think anybody who is innocent [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it even bothered me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- more to just try to imagine what it was like the last --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- minutes on the plane that crashed. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Um, I feel --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- was the first --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- time --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'd ever seen --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- anything [LAUGH] like that.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I mean, [SIGH] running a plane into a building and that was quite hectic and very horrifying for me [SIGH] to see the tape.  And then the news media, they just showed it over and over and over, so [SIGH] the [NOISE] people that lost loved ones, they really didn't have a chance to forget it, you know, when it [SIGH] was at the crucial point of pain. [SIGH] Um, I also know that at the airports and things, things are a lot, uh, different.  A lot of time [SIGH] they will almost treat -- you know, strip you of your dignity, [SIGH] have you to strip down --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- all the way, almost to your underwear and your suspenders and your l- your sock garters, you know, [SIGH] because they're trying to make the world safe, but at the same time [SIGH] I'd think that our system, the po- [MN] as far as the politicians, you know, [SIGH] I think they made a few choices that weren't so appropriate either, because I feel like I heard -- once heard that the president in China said, "This could have been avoided".  You know, and it -- it's just so sad that it had to happen like that, um, [LIPSMACK] I have people of all nationalities that live in building and [LIPSMACK] we get along fine and, you know, I -- like I said again, I don't hate anyone regardless of their color.  You know, I know a lot of the world does at this point, and they're very --
