R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi. 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Hi.  This is Mary from [SIGH] Houston, Texas.
L:  Oh, this is Teresa from Lubbock, Texas.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, [LAUGH] well, at least we're in the same state. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We can understand each other's voices at least.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's a good sign.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know that -- [SIGH] uh, I haven't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- really made very many changes.
R:  [SIGH] I haven't either.  Um, I'm more aware of the news, I guess. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I [SIGH] --
R:  And, um, the airport travel and--
L:  Right.
R:  -- the changes they've made, but [SIGH] --
L:  Also, my day to day routine, I haven't -- I mean, [SIGH] I haven't really made any changes.  I know that for a while I did kind of stock up a little bit on water and food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and make sure I knew where the flashlights and the candles and stuff were, [SIGH] but beyond your basic preparedness --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's pretty much all that I have -- have --
R:  [SIGH] Um, I think a lot of people [NOISE] have, you know, done [NOISE] little things.  I don't know that anybody's gone to any major lengths. 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I know, for our work even, right afterwards they beefed up security so strong it was almost impossible to get into the building.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LIPSMACK] And then they kind of slacked off and now --
L:  It's back at --
R:  -- they're back to where it was.
L:  [SIGH] Yes.  My husband works for the university and it's pretty much the same thing there.  There's no -- hasn't really been any security changes.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, ours was just very --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- minimal, I think and, um --
L:  I guess part of my -- the reason I haven't done more is I feel safe where I live.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, uh --
L:  If I lived on a coastal town or y- you know, I mean, I'm in the heart of Texas, you know, I -- there's just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't worry.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, 'cause I figure there's nothing in Lubbock [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- for -- [SIGH] for them to come and get. [LAUGH] 
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, you know, um, I think, you know, if something were to happen it would be [LIPSMACK] Washington or New York or some -- some place liked that.
L:  I mean, I worry more about my -- something happening at my son's school [SIGH] from another student --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than I do [NOISE] about my own personal safety from a terrorist attack.
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  You know, but to me that's a bigger concern than my -- our day to day activities, you know, um --
R:  Yeah, I -- I'm like you, as far as day to day, I've not really changed anything.
L:  [SIGH] I [SIGH] -- I guess if --
R:  I have learned how to pack for the airport because there are so many things you can't take. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, we don't -- we don't travel.  I mean, my boys did go to --
R:  I don't do that much.
L:  -- they did go to Disney [SIGH] and they did have to go through --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- major stuff to -- you know, getting there ahead of time and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- having all their [MN] baggage -- I mean, they searched it before they even left and then they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, so they wouldn't have any problems getting through [SIGH] security.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  And of course, you know, the things of what you can take on your carry on that you didn't normally think about but now you have to make sure it's in your suitcase.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Toenail clippers. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, yeah, I mean, or even little scissors or [SIGH] --
R:  Tweezers.
L:  You know, how many women used to knit on the plane, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  And they can't.
L:  Not any more.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  I flew in November for Thanksgiving.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And somebody told me, he said, "Well you can go to the -- the internet and it will tell you what you can and cannot take". [SIGH] I didn't even take my hairspray because you could only take a certain s- up to a certain size.
L:  Of the hairspray?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Huh.
R:  You know, and-- and things like that, and I though this is so because [SIGH] you know, they can make an -- [NOISE] uh, something --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- out of a pen, you know, to --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I agree. [NOISE] I mean, [SIGH] but then again, on the other hand --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, if we happen to be on a plane and I guess --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm not prejudiced, but I guess --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I would be more concerned if there were [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of people from those nations --
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] on my plane and I -- I guess I would be happy if they didn't have hairspray and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know what I mean? [SIGH] So, I'm kind of willing to give it all up actually just to make sure that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we are safe.
R:  Oh, I'll tell you a funny about that, though. [LIPSMACK] When I flew, m --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- no, actually it wasn't then it was -- um, I went to New Orleans, I think, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] and [SIGH] we were s- my friend and I were standing in line and this -- you know, they -- they have you -- I think they're supposed to be randomly checking people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I watched each episode of border one oh one. [LAUGH] [SIGH] And uh, they had a little area set up where they'd pull 'em aside and do their checks again [SIGH] and this guy walked up to the counter or to somebody over there, [SIGH] and she told him to go around that way [SIGH] and when he got around there he told the lady that was doing the check that he was, um, a U.S. marshal.  And I thought, you know, this is not too bright. [SIGH] If you're going to be on there, I don't think you'd want to announce it.
L:  No, that's very true.  I mean, I'm sure he has to though, to a certain point to get his guns and stuff through, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] not in front of the general public.
R:  Right, and that's -- that's the way it was and I told her -- [SIGH] we were talking and I said --
L:  Should have been a --
R:  --"Do you know --"
L:  -- wall or something.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I said, "You know, that's the first person they're going to go for on our plane now". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He's not who I'd want to sit next to 'cause [LAUGH] I'd have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to watch my mouth.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause you do have to watch I guess --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- nowadays the things you do say.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you can't tease or --
R:  Yeah, you have to be very careful not to mention certain things. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I mean, you hear all these stories of people saying, you know, h- just -- I don't know, just different stuff and just --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and whenever I went, um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- Indiana, um, I went straight from work, so I had gotten these boots that I wouldn't slip and fall on the ice. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my god. [SIGH] Well, were you --
R:  [NOISE] A-
L:  -- nervous flying.  I mean, were you worried about --
R:  [SIGH] I wasn't really worried, no.
L:  -- is the plane blowing a terrorist bomb --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I mean ?
R:  I don't think so, because, you know, they had beefed up security so much. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know --
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, you know, if there's anything questionable they stop it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] because what happened was [SIGH] I had bought these boots.  Well, I didn't think anything about 'em [SIGH] and whenever I went through [NOISE] the little thing there [SIGH] it went off.
L:  Oh, metal toed?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And they -- they pulled me aside and they said, "It's probably you boots.  Take 'em off and put 'em back through".  And I did, [SIGH] and I walked back through and I was fine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, when I came back [LAUGH] -- but it was a small airport in South Bend, Indiana. [SIGH] When I got along I just automatically took my shoes off.
L:  Oh, I would --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have too. [LIPSMACK] Just stick 'em up on the thing, the big --
R:  [SIGH] I did.
L:  -- screen. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I did, because you know, I thought, you know, this'll save time.
L:  I would have, I would have.
R:  [SIGH] And there were p- a lot of people that were doing that.
L:  Were there?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Well you know, [MN] I -- there probably will come a time that they will make us screen all of our shoes or -- you know, I've seen some of the new technology where it's like x rays.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I'm anxious because [LIPSMACK] I have had back surgery --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and he put rods and screws in my back.
L:  so, you're going to be  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, I don't know, because I asked him --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- when he did that.  I said, "Do I --" because some of the guys I work with have a card. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [SIGH] I said, "Do I need something saying I've had surgery, you know, whenever I go through the law?"  And he said, "No, we can get one if you want it, but it's not really necessary because those are titanium and they're not going to set it off".
L:  That's what I was wondering, but --
R:  So, I don't -- well, that was, you know, my first thing.  I don't fly often and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- my -- like, it's going to go off every time. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my gosh, no.
R:  [SIGH] So.
L:  [MN] I guess for me, I guess one other change I've made is -- is watching our budget, trying not to go overboard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the spending because of the economy, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and watching that, but -- you know, but we're still going on vacation.  Like I said, my boys just went to Disney World, before [SIGH] band trip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and we're going to go to Vegas, so, I mean, we're not concerned about traveling.  Of course, you know, we are driving, but we would be driving either way.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but [MN] uh --
R:  [SIGH] I think there are some people that have cut out a lot of their flying simply because of that.
L:  [SIGH] Well, if I lived in New York --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I would already have moved.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  I mean, I would have moved into the most wooded isolated area possible I could find [SIGH] to live.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but, you know, like I say, the places that I would go to, I -- it doesn't worry me flying because --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, I went to [SIGH] New Orleans and went to South Bend, Indiana and that was about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  if you had to fly to New York or -- or, uh, Washington, D.C. would you be as concerned?  Would you be more concerned or no?
R:  Probably.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, there I probably would be.  I'd be watching [LAUGH] the news and everything.
L:  Uh, see, I -- I [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I think it's --
R:  The security alerts.
L:  -- I really think it's 'cause we're in Texas [SIGH] and we feel like we're in the central --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, I guess you're closer to the water than I am --
R:  Right.
L:  -- though, with you being [SIGH] in Houston.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But isn't that a protected bay, or ?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  See, I don't -- I don't go down to the water very often, down on the gulf, so --
L:  You're not really 
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH]  
L:  [SIGH] Like I --
R:  Um --
L:  -- you know, like I say, for me, being in Texas, there's nothing here, nothing anybody wants.  I mean, [SIGH] I think Texas Tech has a [MN] biohazard thing, but the --
R:  Mhm.
