L:  [NOISE] Erin.
R:  I'm Heidi. 
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, sorry, I'm just talking to my cat.  Hi, my name's Erin, how are you?
R:  Hi, I'm fine.  Is it just you and I or ...?
L:  Yep.
R:  Two people.
L:  Yeah, where are you from, Heidi?
R:  I'm in Idaho.
L:  Oh, cool, I'm in Toronto, Canada.
R:  Oh, nice. 
L:  Yeah, so, um, anyway, so the topic is health and fitness so, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do you work out?
R:  Not as much as I should. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you?
L:  Um, I used to in the winter when it was really cold --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I went to a gym and I did a lot of swimming, but, um, I noticed that now I'm doing a lot more walking since the weather is starting to get better. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So I -- I like to be active, I think it's -- it's important and it's good for the body and stuff like that.
R:  Mm.  I -- I, ah, walk with my kids, but that's --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- about -- yeah, they're, um, three and my daughter will be two tomorrow. 
L:  Oh.  That's so nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're young little things. 
R:  Yeah, they're --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they're young, yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah, so I get out and, um, you know, walk with them.
L:  Oh, good, a lot -- a lot of walking, or ...?
R:  Oh, some.  
L:  Cool.
R:  [LAUGH] Some, I should do more, but, you know --
L:  This is -- I don't know what they want us to talk about, but what -- how's your diet?  Like, do you, um, eat healthy or ...?
R:  Somewhat.
L:  Cool.
R:  But I find myself, um, oh, you know, finishing the kids' meals --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and doing all that kind of stuff, stuff I'd been reading about that's a real big bad thing.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, do you have kids?
L:  Nope. 
R:  No.
L:  No, I'm single.  And I live at home, I'm twenty five.
R:  Twenty five, I'm thirty two. 
L:  Oh, one -- oh, cool. 
R:  But, yeah, I got married when I was twenty six.
L:  Nice.
R:  So, yeah.  So, yeah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- wait to have those babies.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'm -- I can't wait till I'm a [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, your body really does change.
L:  Does it?  What way -- what happens when you have --
R:  I don't know.  You know, they say your metabolism slows down and -- but I don't know, with my son, he was born four years ago and it seems like -- we're still on the topic aren't we? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think so, health and fitness and we're talking about pregnancy and all that's health.
R:  Yeah.  Um, my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- son, um, I don't know, I bounced back within a few months just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- breast feeding, you know, and then my daughter, I don't know if it's my age or second kid, or I don't know, I'm still about ten pounds over.  Which I guess for not really doing much is --
L:  No, that --
R:  -- isn't bad. 
L:  -- that's fine.  Um, I'm probably about five pounds -- no, I'm probably -- I don't know what I am.  I'm, like, five one or something, or five one and a half and I'm about one zero eight.  
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my gosh, I would love to be like you. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I'm one fifty five but, um --
L:  How tall are you?
R:  I am five five. 
L:  Okay. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's not so bad.  
R:  Not horrible but, um, before, you know, when I got pregnant with both of them, I was like one forty five, which --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I always -- still wanna be down to, like, one thirty five --
L:  Yeah, I -- I, um -- well, I'm five inches shorter than you, but at one point -- I think we'll talk about this since we're on the topic of health and fitness -- I just -- I remember I was depressed and stuff and I like a pig, I used to go out on the weekends and eat desserts every single night, and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I gained a ton of weight, I ended up going up to one thirty five, but I was only five one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that -- I was a real big girl at one point and, um, it's -- it's not fun to get too fat because then you start getting, like, depressed and whatever.  I find in the winter it's really hard to, um, to be as -- to keep active and especially --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with colds. 
R:  And you get the whole depressed thing, like, my pants are still tight and that just ticks you off and it ruins your whole day, but I'm not going up a size. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that and also, um, the, you know, the holidays, like Christmas and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] it really makes people eat a lot more, so I find winter is a pretty slow time for activity and then summer's good and then you go away and stuff more and whatever.  I'm going to Europe actually for two weeks --
R:  Nice. 
L:  -- and I'll be walking and walking like crazy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I'll hopefully lose a couple of pounds, so ...
R:  Oh, well, more than a couple. 
L:  I hope so.
R:  Of course, you'll be eating too and --
L:  Yeah, I'll be eating, but I'll try and stay away from desserts, 'cause those are, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- really brutal.  I mean, basically I'm not a health nut at all, I eat what I want, but I just cut desserts out of my diet and -- and anything deep fried or fattening.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Fries, you know, um [LIPSMACK] chicken fa- -- anything deep fried.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause it's terrible for you. 
R:  Right. 
L:  So, um, what about your family members?
R:  Oh, my husband just stays active, you know, round the house, ah, cutting wood and, you know, guys' stuff, but he just -- he's -- he's slim anyway to begin with --
L:  Nice.
R:  -- but he stays pretty active.  Yeah, he's lucky.  And the kids are sticks.  They're --
L:  Of course.
R:  -- just little sticks.
L:  They're little kids, yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nice.  
R:  But they eat hardly anything and they, um, they are just little biddy things. 
L:  Can I ask you --
R:  But, yeah ...
L:  -- some personal questions about having kids?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it -- did you give birth the natural way?
R:  I did with my daughter --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- but my son was born four years ago and I had a C section with him, and both my kids were born about eight weeks early, so I have a -- a funny uterus, so -- a weird, you know --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- yeah, misshapen uterus.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- son, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- had a C section with him --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess to talk about health and fitness, you know, that took a while back -- to get, um, my, um, body back in shape, you know. 
L:  Of course.
R:  But just 'cause it -- it was -- it -- it -- it's huge surgery [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had no idea and, um, with my daughter they had told me I was gonna have to, um, have a C section with her, too, which was totally fine with me because I am -- I was scared of all that childbirth crap --
L:  So, but you didn't have a C section with her, right?
R:  No, my water broke and she was born, like, an hour later.
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  And she only weighed -- my son weighed three nine, and my daughter weighed three fourteen --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and so they're little biddy things. 
L:  Oh. 
R:  But I'm [inaudible] them in.  I hear if labor goes fast, then it comes on so fast your body isn't prepared.  If you, like, stretch out real fast and your -- your endorphins in your brain, you know, all those, like, work out, you know, how your endorphins in your brain --
L:  If you're not ready then what happens?
R:  Yeah, and it's meant to hurt more.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  If it -- if it comes, like, I mean, within an hour -- you know, an hour --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and that's what happened, and I swear I don't know how people do it with, like, six, seven pound kids.
L:  Oh, my God, did it hurt?
R:  It, oh, it was horr- -- it was, I mean, here you are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with no kids, but it was horrible.  I never could have imagined --
L:  Are you serious?
R:  It was terrible, but, you know, I -- there was no --
L:  They didn't give you, um, the needle to freeze your --
R:  There was no time for it. 
L:  Ah. 
R:  I mean, she was born -- by the time the doctor got there -- she was born, like, at two in the morning -- by the time the doctor got there, no nurse had checked me or anything -- by the time the doctor checked me, I mean, she was literally born, like, two minutes later. 
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  He was like, "You made it through the hard part, you can do this".  And I'm like, "No". [LAUGH] 
L:  That's crazy.
R:  But, I mean, that's, like, a terrible, terrible experience, but it's probably really unique.  I mean, you're not going to have to go through any of that, so ...
L:  I hope not.  But, um --
R:  You'll be fine.
L:  -- do you work as well as raise the kids?
R:  No, no.
L:  You're a stay at home mom?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nice.  Do you think -- another question, I don't know if this is still on the topic, but do you find that once you have kids that, ah, yo- -- the wo- -- somebody's got to be there full time for them?
R:  Oh, it just makes it -- for one it makes it easy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, I don't know, you know, I was going to go back to work after they were born --
L:  What kind of work do you do?
R:  I worked in a hospital.  I did, um, um, medical records and, you know, coding and, um, ke- -- a little bit of transcription and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's what I did.  So, um --
L:  Nice.
R:  -- I was gonna go, but I was commuting an hour to work, too, which is cruddy.
L:  Okay.
R:  But I was going to find a local job and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put him in childcare and, you know, all that kind of stuff, but then after he was born, of course he was a preemie and so that required special care and the doctor immediately said, "He's not going to be able to go out this winter, he's gotta -- you're going to have to stay at home with him", because there's an R.S.V. virus, it's called --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like really bad pneumonia, so if a normal kid would have cold --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he would get R.S.V.  So they said, "No, um, no child care".  So that was fine with me 'cause I didn't really wanna leave him anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, um, it just turned out that, um, it's hard, like, putting two kids in car seats and getting them out the door and it's -- something always comes up, somebody's gotta go to the bathroom, somebody's not eaten and they -- you gotta wait for them to eat, or, you know, something's going on. 
L:  So basically you're saying it's really difficult for two people to work and raise kids at the same time?  It's -- 
R:  I think so.
L:  Right.
R:  It just works out easier, and then, you know, and then they say you don't have the expense of commuting, you don't have to buy dinners, you have more time to bargain shop, you have more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you don't have to buy clothes to work.
L:  I think it works out cheaper, doesn't it?
R:  I think it does.  I really do. 
L:  I think so too.
R:  Really do.
L:  And then think about it also, you have to pay for day care --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and what's that a year?  Twenty grand or something?
R:  It's expensive.  It's, like --
L:  So, like, what does -- what does a woman really make?  I mean, oh, if she's making --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- thirty grand then all her money's going towards that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When if she stays at home --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- what's the difference?
R:  That, oh, [NOISE] --
L:  Is that your kids?
R:  Oh, no, oh, I thought -- I thought they got disconnected. 
L:  No, they -- I think they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tell you --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- "Your call is being cut off", or something.
R:  Oh.  They do?  That's going to be sad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I like talking to you.
L:  I know, it's fun.
R:  This is the first -- this is the first time I've ever done this, so ...
L:  Oh, okay, cool.
R:  All the other calls I haven't been home for. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  So ...
L:  Um, so, I don't know, I, ah, I'm just curious about the stuff, you know, with kids and stuff, because --
R:  Yeah, and then -- and then you -- you worry about 'em getting ignored at day care, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  My little guy's so shy.  My little girl is more outgoing, but it's just so much easier and I know I'm giving them atten- -- you know, all the attention they need and --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- and they're s- -- they're -- I think they're smart, 'course all moms probably think that, but I just think you -- I don't know, it just --
L:  You feel better, don't you, like, raising them --
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  -- yourself and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's great 'cause that's -- I guess in the future I'd like to do that myself as well and I -- I just -- I don't know, I hear these days you need two incomes and this and that --
