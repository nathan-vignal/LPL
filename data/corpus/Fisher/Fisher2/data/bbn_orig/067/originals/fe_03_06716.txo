L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Liz.
R:  I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi, Debbie.  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Um, Omaha, Nebraska.
L:  Omaha, Nebraska, wow.  I'm all the way in Florida. 
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Could they pick two people further apart? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, no kidding. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I must be -- we're supposed to talk about health and fitness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is this your first call with Fisher?
R:  No, second.
L:  Second, same with me, yep, so I guess we're really supposed to talk about that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  [MN] It must be hard to -- to get out in health and fitness in the snow. 
R:  Ye- -- well, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, no, there's a lot of clubs around, but I don't really work out a whole lot, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't either so this, you know, [LAUGH] this topic, oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it was like, "Oh, well --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- all right". 
L:  "All right, whatever". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Um --
L:  The last couple of topics were about, like, the war and national security and whatever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I'm like, "You know, I just don't want to talk about it any more". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I [MN] -- what was the one that I -- something about [NOISE] businesses or something was the last one I did. 
L:  Oh, no.  The last, like, two -- two of them I declined because it was about the war.  I'm like, "I just don't wanna talk about it any more".
R:  Yeah, I know. 
L:  Okay, health and fitness --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I can handle that.  We can all whine about how we don't get enough exercise. 
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I wish it would just happen for me, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, if they can figure out some way to magically -- it was so funny, 'cause I was just talking to a friend of mine a half an hour ago and, um, she -- I didn't know she works at a gym and I'm like, "Well, what do you teach?"  And she was -- she teaches kickboxing and all this.  I'm like, "Oh, yeah, well, no, no, thank you". 
R:  [LAUGH] Not for me.
L:  You won't see me there. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, I know.  I -- my sister in law is really into working out.  She -- she goes every day for about three hours.
L:  Oh, my God. 
R:  But she doesn't have any -- she's -- she's single and she doesn't have any kids or --
L:  Kids, yeah.
R:  -- anything, so she -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, yeah. 
R:  -- she doesn't --
L:  I'm --
R:  -- she doesn't really --
L:  -- I'm assuming you're like me and not in that category?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.  Okay.
R:  No.  No.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's what I was telling my friend, that I -- I went to yoga and I really liked it and I did it for about a year and I really, really enjoyed it, but a hard time making the class schedules work for me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, seven o'clock at night is the worst time for me to go out [LAUGH] and have time for myself. 
R:  Right. 
L:  You know.
R:  Right. 
L:  I think -- do something while, you know, my kid's at school or whatever, you know. 
R:  [NOISE] Maybe. [LAUGH] 
L:  Maybe it would work, but ...
R:  Yeah. 
L:  At least the problem here in Florida is things during the day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are geared lots of times, like classes like that, for older people who don't need such a strenuous workout as younger people. 
R:  Right, right, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, they're [MN] -- I don't even know if there's daytime [LAUGH] -- daytime at -- any daytime cl- classes, I haven't even looked up here, which is, I guess, pretty sad, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] There's just not enough hours in the day.
R:  Yeah, well, that's kinda what I figure.  Well, you know, I chase my kids all day so that's workout enough for me, I suppose.
L:  It's gotta be some kind of workout. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Although --
L:  [inaudible] that's what I say, I don't understand why I'm not much thinner. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I -- I took 'em to the zoo the other day and it just about killed me, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That was a good workout, think of it that way. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, but the thing is, I don't do that every day. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that -- that -- that's what they say, like every day.  I'm like, "Well, you know --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- it comes and goes in spurts, you know".
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it depends on, you know, how fat I'm feeling. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes. [LAUGH] I just got a new job that I walk a lot in.  Um, I keep saying I'm going to buy one of those pedometer things to see how much I am walking every day.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But I -- I -- I mean, I've only been doing it for a month and I've lost seven pounds so I know I'm walking a ton more than I did before. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, ah, that's fine, you know, if I can keep up with that [LAUGH] that would be great. 
R:  There's a girl I used to work with that did that.  She -- one day she brought it and I think she figured after her -- the end of the day, she had walked, like, seven miles. 
L:  Really?
R:  That's -- and it -- and it wasn't -- I mean, sh- -- that was up and down steps and all over the place too so --
L:  Wow. 
R:  -- it wasn't just -- 'cause she said --
L:  Wasn't just straight --
R:  -- she was just curious. 
L:  -- walking.  Yeah, m- m- my job is strange.  I go to different stores and I check on a product in different stores, so I mean I, you know, think about it, I'm not really supposed to park at the front of the parking lot [inaudible], you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- vendors -- so I walk from the back of the parking lot and I go in the store and I walk up and down the aisles looking for the product and walk the perimeter of the store and then go back to my car.  And, I mean, I'm doing big places like Walmart. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I mean, so if you think about it -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the first week, I was like, "Oh, my God, I'm exhausted".
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But that's a lot of walking.  
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] it is a lot of walking. 
L:  So, that's why I keep saying, I'm -- I'm going to get a pedometer thing [LAUGH] and see what it is. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And try to figure --
R:  Yeah, that is --
L:  -- out why I haven't -- I've only lost seven pounds. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well -- well, it could be -- I mean, you know, I mean, you need more to eat more when you [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  That's -- that's --
R:  -- w- walk more and stuff --
L:  -- definitely part of it --
R:  -- so ...
L:  -- definitely part of it.  So, have you begun to thaw up there, or no?
R:  Have -- what?
L:  I- is -- is it starting to be springtime or ...?
R:  Yeah, yeah, we --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- it's -- I just turned on the A.C. today, so ...
L:  Oh, that's good. 
R:  For the first time. 
L:  That's --
R:  I -- I don't -- well, I think it only got up to, [NOISE] like, eighty though, [NOISE] so ...
L:  Oh, well, today it was awful here, today.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It was ninety one and about ninety percent humidity all day.
R:  Ew, yuck.
L:  And then it finally, finally thunderstormed, it's like you're almost so happy for it. 
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And just -- just --
R:  Yeah, when it --
L:  -- just to break it a little bit and now it's -- oh, now it's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- balmy eight five. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But the humidity has gone way down, so ...
R:  [inaudible]
L:  A lot of people down here in Florida, if they exercise outside, it's very early in the morning or at night.  You see people running at night --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because it's just so much cooler.  You can't --
R:  Much nicer.
L:  -- go out in the middle of the day to do something. 
R:  I -- I wouldn't think so.  I mean, I'm originally from Kansas and it's amazing how much just one state di- -- makes a difference.  I mean --
L:  Makes a difference.
R:  -- as far as further south, I mean, they -- down there in Kansas, they counted -- in the summer they would count the days over a hundred, up here they count the days over ninety. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And so, [LAUGH] and it's about the same number, yeah? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's [LAUGH] --
L:  But just a -- a big difference.  I don't know.  We used to live in Massachusetts in the cold and the snow, we grew up there, and after living in warm weather for a while [MN] we'll never go back to the cold. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] I mean, it's -- it's kinda nice just not to have to -- we have to think about rain here on occasion, but it's pretty predictable, it's the end of the day thunderstorm, you can still plan your day.  It's so nice not to have to --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- "Well, I don't know if I can do that 'cause of the weather".
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  Or -- or the, [SIGH] you know, you never know if you're going to be snowed in or ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, I mean, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I -- oh God, I remember shoving my kid in a snowsuit and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and loading everything up for, like, you know, getting out and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then it'd be too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- snowy to go anywhere. 
R:  Yeah.  And nothing would be open. [LAUGH] 
L:  And nothing would be open --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "Oh, yeah, okay, let's have a play date tomorrow" and then it'd be two feet of snow, "Sorry, can't come".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Can't make it".  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's nice not to have to [LAUGH] --
R:  Although it's amazing --
L:  -- deal with that.
R:  -- I mean, it's like that at the beginning of the winter, but by the end of the winter it doesn't matter any more.  Nobody cares. [LAUGH] 
L:  Nobody -- they just wanna get out and do whatever?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And nobody cares, you know, beginning of the winter, you know, you get six inches and people are all, you know [MN] --
L:  Freaking out.
R:  -- schools close and everything.  End of the winter, two feet and nobody even stops. [LAUGH] 
L:  We don't -- we don't care, we're all still getting out. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, so ...
L:  Getting out, yeah.
R:  It's kinda funny. 
L:  I -- I definitely noticed it with the sunshine.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, and -- and we've lived here for two years and I lived in California for four years before that and we notice that we feel kinda sad if there's not sunshine.  I mean --
R:  That's true.  [inaudible]
L:  -- really, you know, it's very interesting.  I understand about people and that seasonal affective disorder now.  
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Because we're sp- -- we're spoilt, we just say, "We're just spoilt", you know, with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're just loving that beautiful weather and God forbid if we have a cloudy day.  But I definitely see how it can really affect people.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, my dad has that and he really has to -- during the winter he has to, you know, make sure to open a lot of windows, leave a lot of lights on. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  You know, stuff like that, just to --
L:  -- definitely can under- -- totally can understand that because we've gotten spoiled and -- and, I mean, there's a difference -- that -- because, you know what I'm saying, there's a difference --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- between spoiled and having something wrong with you, but, boy oh boy, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh, my -- my kid, oh my God, you know, "We didn't get to have recess today". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I feel like one of those old people, "When we were a kid you know how many snow days we had?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  How many --
R:  "We walked up and downhill both ways".
L:  Yeah, yeah, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And you complain because you didn't go out for recess?  Give me a break. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  We didn't have recess the whole month of January. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We got to play games indoors. 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but it just shows what you, ah, what you are used to. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  How many kids do you have?
R:  Two.
L:  How old are they?
R:  Um, one and three.
L:  Oh, so sweet. 
R:  What about you? [LAUGH]
L:  I have one, seven and a half year old boy. 
R:  Oh, yeah, that's a fun age [SIGH] I think.
L:  Kinda -- kinda interesting.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, kinda interesting.  Getting smart, which, you know, means --
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  -- more, ah --
R:  -- that's true, they just start, ah, developing, about f- -- yeah, fourth grade they start --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- getting that attitude down and --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We already get a little bit of that here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One was very sweet.  Oh, I miss cuddly babies.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  No more cuddly baby in this house. 
R:  Yeah, she's -- she's pretty cuddly, but, you know, [MN] she's actually sixteen months and is starting to show the temper, so ...
L:  Ah, ah, ah.
R:  She yells at me sometimes, it's kinda funny.
L:  Ah.
R:  I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   -- try not to laugh too hard, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you can't do that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Too much because, you know, but usually she -- she'll just get mad and she'll come up and just yell at me. 
L:  Oh, funny.
R:  Like, okay, this is going to be interesting as you get older. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we have to stop this soon. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  At least she's not a throw herself on the floor, fit --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- one, yet.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, no, not yet.
R:  Hopefully won't --
L:  That was the worst --
R:  [LAUGH] Hopefully not.
L:  -- that -- that little stage was the worst.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, now we just have a lot more smarts behind what we, ah, disagree with.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  Actually sitting here now.  
R:  -- my pediatrician --
L:  But you know what --
R:  What?
L:  Now is kinda nice though.  He does -- he -- he does some big kid things that are pretty interesting, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right now he's watching T.V.  I let him stay up a little extra late tonight and he's watching the Discovery Channel about the history of rockets or something.  He's fascinated by it. 
R:  That's good. 
L:  I'm like, "Okay, [LAUGH] whatever". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Okay, sounds better than cartoons, sure, okay".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, I'm happy if he's watching anything, he doesn't -- ne- neither one of 'em are really big on T.V. so ...
L:  He's not either.  He is not, but, um, I notice when he's really tired, and we had such a busy weekend with the holiday --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, they have these out -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out of business --
