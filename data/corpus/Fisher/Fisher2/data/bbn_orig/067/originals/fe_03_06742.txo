L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  My name is Patrick O'Rourke.
L:  Hi.  My name is Jill Fautsiss[?].
R:  And I'm from California.
L:  And I'm from Philadelphia.
R:  Okay, cool.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, basically I haven't made too many different changes.  Um, I mean, I, you know, care about people more and --
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, some of the effects on, you know, on legislation I've changed my views.
L:  Like in what way?  I'm kind of curious to know.
R:  Uh, well, basically, uh, when it came to, uh, some of the bills that were passed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I'm an activist.
L:  Okay.
R:  And the word around town is that, uh, you know, that part of the problem with, uh, some of the bills is that if you're, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- speaking out against the President then you're considered, you know, you can be considered as being, uh, you know, sympathizing to the terrorists.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Which is just a really negative way to go about it.
L:  Yes, and silly too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, because this country was based on freedom of speech --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which means that no matter what your viewpoints as long as you're not, you know, like actively calling for harming another human being you have the right to say whatever you want --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- in my opinion.  Yeah.
R:  Um, if you don't mind, [MN] um, I'm a democrat.  What are you?  
L:  [SIGH] Um, I'm a registered democrat but at this point I am, um --
R:  In between?
L:  -- kind of waiting -- independent, yeah.
R:  I'm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in between myself too, right now.  Um, I'm kind of- -- I'm kind of gl- -greeing with Clinton that both parties complement each other.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That they're both needed.
L:  Right, right.
R:  That they're both super necessary.
L:  Right. [SIGH] But you know I think in terms of -- of the whole September eleventh deal I think that both parties [SIGH] -- I don't know, it's just been interesting to see how they've reacted.  Um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- and I -- I think that [SIGH] i- it's almost like I feel the democrats are afraid to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- speak out --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- perhaps about how they truly feel in terms of some of the restrictions and the changes that have happened.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, as a result of -- of --
R:  I agree with that totally.
L:  -- September eleventh.
R:  I ag- -- I agree that it's been more so, um, since the -- uh, not the Patriot Act but the other one.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, uh --
R:  The Homeland --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, Security Act.
L:  Yes, yes.   Mhm.
R:  The fact that the Congressmen, uh, that were asking, uh, that were interviewing, uh, Bill Cheney -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- basically during the hearings --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on that.  Um, they couldn't go ahead and get to see the list but some of these Congressmen are in fact able to go ahead and investigate NORAD.  They're able to go there and inspect it and CIA Headquarters --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- in Langley but they can't go ahead and see prisoners of war and the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- fact that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, t- -- that, uh, p-, that -- that, uh, bill actually also is in -- in service.  It's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- temporarily, quote unquote, suspends --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- freedoms until the -- until the war on terrorism --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is won.
L:  Yeah, it -- it's -- it --
R:  It's -- it's -- very, very, very -- it's too --
L:  Yeah, it's disturbing.
R:  -- broad a powers.
L:  Well, in terms of changes that I've made in my own life, I mean, I live in a major city obviously in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Philadelphia and, um, you know, I tend to be a pretty practically minded person.  I mean, I've -- I've always been, you know, sort of alert for just, you know, anyone who's going to possibly cause me harm just because in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a city you have to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, I don't necessarily think that I've made, you know, concrete changes.  I mean, maybe I'm on the lookout a little bit more just as a human being.  You know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if -- if I see someone of, you know, Arab descent in a large group perhaps the human part of me, not that it's right, but the human part of me may become a little more vigilant, but I then try to catch myself and say, you know, that you have to be fair to people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but the human part of me, yeah, sometimes is tempted to maybe be a little more suspicious or afraid.  So, sometimes I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- find myself struggling.
R:  I think I agree.  I was in front of Toys R Us.  I live over here by the beach and I was in front of Toys R Us and I saw a large group of 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were coming out Toy- -- couple of 'em coming out Toys R Us and they started talking and I looked at 'em and then I -- you know, and -- one of 'em was even wearing a towel on a his head --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The turban and, uh, you know, I always felt really, really offended by that term but anyways --
L:  Yeah, I -- I guess --
R:  Uh, I -- I was looking at them and then I saw, you know, that they were buying stuff and I was just like --
L:  Sure.
R:  I was saying, "Well, why am I looking at these guys?  Why is it becoming like this?"  But then I realized too, you know, that a lot of things that -- that are -- that are present you've got to go ahead and balance it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the bottom line is, "Be vigilant but don't be -- I mean, don't jump the gun". 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't accuse people until you -- until you know and that's how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've lived my life.
L:  Yeah, and I think -- I think that makes sense.  I think that part of the problem is, you know, and -- and this is with any +other -- other issue when you have a group of people who have, you know, clearly done something and -- and, you know, it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's easy to target them.  I mean, I guess racial profiling is the term that's used and it's --
R:  Well, it's not only racial profiling, it's lifestyle profiling too.
L:  Sure, yeah, that's exactly right.
R:  I mean, for a lot -- I just watched a movie on, uh, Cable.  It was about, uh -- Sundance Channel I believe it was on -- about how for a long time it was assumed that gay people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- were also child molesters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And this guy went to jail for a long time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because the -- he lived in a small town and they actually believed that.
L:  Yeah.  Which is ridiculous.  I mean, people's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stereotypes I think take over and cause them to be, you know, very afraid but --
R:  I -- 
L:  I'm -- I'm just --
R:  But I think positively it's actually made me more vigilant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of -- of -- of -- of -- of the negative impacts of -- of racial and, you know, stuff and our freedoms.  It's, uh, made me appreciate my freedom more.  
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's a really good point.
R:  It --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] I -- I think one of the things that it's -- this is going back to sort of what you said that -- that a lot of things have happened in this country where if you speak out you're considered unpatriotic.  I think it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- made me -- it has made me appreciate my freedoms more but it's also made me -- I guess it increased my frustration with the current administration --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, I tend to lean more toward being -- I -- I guess, uh, war protester is maybe a little strong.  I mean, I can see both sides of it but I tend to be more, I guess, you know, war must be the absolute last option and I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, get frustrated when I see that people --
R:  [SIGH] I've been frustrated with my friends too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I've told them, "Listen, Iraq needed to be freed.  The people wanted it to be free --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, when they spoke out in the streets just before we attacked there were large numbers of interviews and everyone they talked to was like, "Don't quote me.  Don't quote me.  Don't quote me."
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, of only a couple of people actually put themselves on camera and put their lives and their family at -- at -- at -- at -- at -- at extreme danger.
L:  Yeah, it's a risk --
R:  And -- but -- 
L:  I mean, it's a risk.
R:  But the fact was that they said that they, you know, they wouldn't thi- -- they didn't think that there'll be jumping and -- and joy in the streets but they welcomed -- they were just, um, how do you say?  Uh, tr- trepidation.  They had trepidation for the, you know, for American invaders.
L:  Yeah, and -- and --
R:  And that's because of our track record doesn't speak -- doesn't speak --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well of us.
L:  I think, you know, I don't know if this may -- this is pertinent to the question; how has it changed my life?  But it's certainly made me much more aware in my thinking of how Americans are perceived --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, overseas.  I mean, I've been overseas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been to the Middle East and I've seen it but I think now more than ever I think we as Americans have a tremendous responsibility to be careful of the kind of perceptions we're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- leaving people with and I don't think we're --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- doing a very good job.
R:  I -- I think actually I've changed a few of my things and actually focused on new things I didn't think were important and one of 'em is [SIGH] not war reparations but apologies.
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, w- we can go that far without no trouble.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've read of so many times in Afghanistan as, you know, and it was right after September eleventh that we attacked Afghanistan.
L:  Right.
R:  They were j- -- they -- people were sitting there; their villages, their people bombed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because the Taliban had controlled it.
L:  Right.
R:  They were there but we had to bomb it and they said, "My house was bombed.  I'm not asking 'em to come in to build it --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I just want an apology.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I want h- -- them to come down here and say, 'Listen, we're sorry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This was a necessary evil and we're sorry'".
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] well let me ask you --
R:  And that's -- that's all they wanted.
L:  Right.
R:  They wanted some acknowledgement of their pain.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think anybody who is wrong, uh, duh, I -- I -- I personally believe this.  I have come to realize this over the last two years.  I've practically, you know, finalized it but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- basically it's that [MN] when someone is unjust -- is -- is -- is unjustly whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whatever injustice happens to them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It can become anger through resentment --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- because it's not corrected.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and resentful -- anger that comes out of resentment is the hardest to heal.
L:  Yeah, that's very true.
R:  That's why we have the whole Mid East thing.  That's why we have countries that hate us.
L:  That's exactly right and this --
R:  That's what happened --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in, uh, in -- in, uh, in Carter's administration. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  These people actually hated us.
L:  Yeah, and understandably because of our policies but --
R:  Right.
L:  Let me ask you a question.  Like, do you live near a large city at all?  I mean, are you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  I live near Los Angeles and Long Beach is not too far away.
L:  Okay.  So, i- in that sense, I mean, have you noticed -- like have you made any changes in terms of -- of your own personal security --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- or like when you go some place or when you choose to --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- do an activity? [SIGH]
R:  Uh, really can't in this part of town, really can't.  Uh, anywhere you go is -- is maybe possibly, what if kind of target.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know, it's like -- it's like it's not a high risk target.  I'm not living right near the San Onofre Power Plant.  I'm not living right -- but, I mean, wh-, uh, you know, you have the -- you have a large number of federal buildings in Los Angeles.
L:  Okay.
R:  Two of the major locations in California, actually two circuit of appeals, uh, one of them is in Los Angeles, one of 'em is in Northern California.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, so a large federal presence in Los Angeles.  You have Long Beach which is also known for its Naval Base.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Up the coast you also have a few other, you know, uh, [SIGH] military installations that are, you know, uh, like an +AWACS Station or something up north.
L:  Okay.
R:  Just not too far, near Point Magoo.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, the point is that if there's an attack I know that there's not too much I can do t- to survive it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay, if it's a nuclear attack.  If it's a -- a dirty bomb [SIGH], you know, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- know the ways how to get out of town.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if I'm able to get out of town then -- eh, but it's not a fatalistic, it's a realistic approach.
L:  Yes. [SIGH] Yeah, and I --
R:  I- it's -- it's -- and I'm not paranoid looking for every station.  I know that there's a -- there's -- if it's a dirty bomb at least there's a, you know, there's like a couple of, um, [LIPSMACK] of, uh, what do you call it?  Of, uh, of, uh -- I know where the bomb shelters are.
L:  Okay.
R:  Which is the only way you're gonna survive because
