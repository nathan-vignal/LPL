R:  Hi, this is Joe.
L:  Hello, this is Ria.
R:  How're you doing tonight?
L:  I'm okay.  From New York?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  From New York?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Uh, me too.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, I guess you had, uh, your eyes on -- on the whole mess, yourself too, huh?
R:  Well, yeah, I was at work that day, so, uh, I worked on, uh -- well, I used to work on Twenty Fourth Street --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, I -- I could basically see the smoke and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah, we could see the smoke all the way out to Harlem, so --
R:  Really?
L:  -- [LAUGH] yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, well, I guess --
L:  Well, everybody in New York, basically.
R:  -- I guess I was a little bit closer, I c- -- I could smell it, you know?
L:  Mhm.  And the next day we smell, like, uh, like, you know, like the burning metal?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, the whole air, you know, the next day.  It smell like melting -- you know, you get a smell like metal burning?
R:  Yeah, y- y- you could smell a whole bunch of stuff, it was a -- I -- I walked down to Fourteenth Street that day --
L:  Mm, I didn't go down there --
R:  -- and uh --
L:  -- for almost a year.
R:  Well, I -- I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- since I was so close, I walked down to Fourteenth Street --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, just -- just to see s- -- well, [LAUGH] not so much out of curiosity, like the morbid curiosity.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But that's where my train was and all the trains had stopped running?
L:  Yes.
R:  So, I had to go to Fourteenth Street --
L:  Hah.
R:  So, I walked down to Fourteenth Street, so I got a better look, more, I guess, noticeable, uh, odor coming off --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the World Trade Center and I guess I realized the seriousness of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause t- -- it looked like a real disaster.  Remember, I didn't see it on TV till I got home and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- long after --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you know, everything had happened --
L:  Yeah, I know --
R:  -- I had no idea it was a two plane --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was both towers and I think a third tower went down, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Was it three -- three --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- towers or just two towers collapsed?
L:  Oh, I think the whole -- the whole -- the -- it was, like, is World Trade five -- I think the whole area's cleaned out now.
R:  Yeah, but -- but I think it was the first two towers they hit and then the third tower went down as well.
L:  Oh, I know the first --
R:  I think so, I -- 
L:  -- yeah,  I know the first t- --
R:  -- I mean, you know, I'm not really a news fanatic --
L:  Yeah, that -- yeah, that's two towers went down and they just went down on top of the other one.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, well, so --
L:  And so what -- how you change your life? [LAUGH]
R:  How did I change my life?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, honestly, I'm not one of these people that, like, is very suspicious of everyone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm not, like, so afraid of, like, gas attacks on the subway or somebody dropping a bomb on a bridge --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, I'll be honest with you, I didn't change it a whole lot, I mean, you know, I figure when I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  I'm completely opposite.  I -- I got a little traumatized by that myself.
R:  Did you?
L:  Yes.  And I was, like, in the house a whole -- you know, the whole lot, [LAUGH] you know, man, I tried my best not to have to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to go out there for a while and --
R:  Well, --
L:  -- and -- an- -- [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I -- I -- I sympathize with that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I can understand that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, [SIGH] for me, I said to myself, "I, you know, I don't want to be afraid in my own backyard" as they put it, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wh- wh- where I live, I don't want to be afraid, so, I figure if something's going to happen, it's going to happen whether I'm looking out for it or I ain't.
L:  Yeah, right, that's true.
R:  So, I -- I try not to worry about it too much.  Don't get me wrong, if I --
L:  Well, you kind of strong it then, 'cause I got completely paranoid.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I really did.
R:  I mean, you know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- if you see -- if you see a mad man, plain as day, coming at you, that might, you know -- that would make me frightened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I wasn't going to get mys- --
L:  But then, see, like, I -- absolutely, I agree with seeing it on TV, you wouldn't know, so everybody looked, then, like, kind of suspicious.  I didn't know who that man paid to do what now, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  See, 'cause he had that kind of money --
R:  Well --
L:  -- so he could've just -- you know, pay anybody and then as you hear and people just walking around blowing themselves up over there --
R:  Yeah, but, see --
L:  -- since they blow up other things --
R:  -- but serious thing over here is they want to destroy, like, monuments, they want to make, like, real big, you know, s- --
L:  Mm, statements --
R:  -- something big --
L:  -- like, yeah.
R:  -- they're not looking to take out, like, a small building with a few people in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they want to take out some huge thing that, like, is very noticeable round the world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I didn't work in a building like that, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I figured to myself, "Yeah, they might hit the subway" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but chances are they'll hit the subway at a place like Grand Central --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, a major area, they're not going to just pick any stop where there's only a couple hundred people, tops --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and bomb it, they're going to hit, like, a main stop where ten different trains pull in.  So, I wasn't really worried.  Plus, I wasn't really w- -- after that, I figured, they'd be out of their mind to strike again, I mean --
L:  Mm.  Yeah, I -- I thought he was going to do it right quickly afterward, you know, like, some germ warfare, you know, something that is going to spread on to everybody, everybody gets in, you know, contact with the disease real fast, you know, like we [several inaudible words], everybody, like, off guard a little bit, behind those two buildings --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I figure, that's where he'll come and do another little attack --
R:  Yeah, I just figures it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I just figured this, you can't change your whole life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, you know, like you said, you could stay home or whatever you do, but, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thought to myself I couldn't change a whole lot and I still had to get pay check --
L:  Yeah, I hear that.
R:  -- I had to keep going to work, so no matter what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the best way to look at it was, if I wasn't afraid, it'd make going to work a lot easier. [MN] 
L:  Mhm.  That's it.
R:  If all of a sudden I got nervous [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- all of a sudden --
L:  It's like calling in sick, isn't it, eh?
R:  -- any -- any person who looks strange made me get, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nervous, I -- I'd be in a panic attack, so, I just said, "You know, hey, right, this is life, you know, it goes on" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "unfortunate" --
L:  You ever been in a war, one of the wars?
R:  Have I been ...?
L:  Yeah, like Cambodia or something like that?
R:  In the army, you mean?
L:  Yeah, the army.
R:  No, I've never been in the army.
L:  Oh.
R:  My brother was in the --
L:  You sound like you taken it pretty well. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I -- I'm just one of those practical people, that, you know, a little bit more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if things are going to happen and I mean, I could get hit by a car, let alone the target, you know, of a terrorist --
L:  Yeah, that's true, right and walking there you get hit in the head with a meteoroid or something like that if it's time for you to go, right?
R:  That's it and I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just figure as long as I can go quickly, I'm not going to [LAUGH] worry too much --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm not being tortured to death, [MN] I'm willing to take it, you know, when it comes.  I'll live with it, that -- that -- that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, I didn't change a whole lot, I really didn't.
L:  Yeah, so right, I even h- -- I even got counseling. [MN]
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, I really did.
R:  I -- I just figured, you know, I just felt really bad that this --
L:  Yeah, I was --
R:  -- type of thing --
L:  -- I was really down --
R:  -- that could happen, number one --
L:  -- in a real slump, like, for a while. 
R:  -- in the United States --
L:  -- for a while.
R:  -- and number two, in New York --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, the big -- the biggest and most popular city --
L:  Yes, I mean, I --
R:  -- that's -- that's the horrible thing --
L:  -- this is my home, this is my home town --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- and I wasn't planning on moving.
R:  -- and the worst -- the worst thing is, you'd figure we would be safe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in New York, I mean, it's --
L:  And that's something else too, that got me kind of scared, how can they just fly into the country like that and then do what they want to do and nobody seen them --
R:  Well --
L:  -- and the second airplane actually just turned and went into it and they wasn't able to stop it.  That's what's really got me scared, that we wasn't safe and this is what, you know, your tax money is paying for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, [inaudible] that part of the tax money, the biggest part, is for the army and everything like that, right?
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  Mm
R:  -- no, you're right --
L:  Mm?
R:  -- you're right, but --
L:  And then you wasn't protected --
R:  -- unfortunately, I --I don't think --
L:  -- and they could have got me.
R:  -- anybody expected them to strike in such a way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they might have figured some day they might try it, you know, after all, they did try it once before --
L:  Oh, they got all these radars and everything, why they couldn't see it?  That's what I'm wond- -- that's --
R:  I don't kn- -- yeah, --
L:  -- what I'm wondering.
R:  -- I know, once they started flying low enough --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and once they d- -- weren't s- -- they weren't flying in the same pattern --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, not only did they strike World Trade Center --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they were g- --
L:  I'm here.
R:  -- they were going for the Pentagon, remember?
L:  Mhm, yeah, yeah.
R:  But that shows you, they're really crazy people.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, you know, they weren't going stop just at New York, they were going for any place they could go for --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- that's madness --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- that's true madness.  These people are willing to die for what they believe in.
L:  Mm, that's right, that's what I felt.
R:  I mean, I'm willing to die, but I don't know that I'd run out and say, "Let me do it" just 'cause somebody tells me to --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] That's what I'm talking about.
R:  -- there's a big difference.
L:  Mhm, and they going to try to take as many people as what they can, with them.
R:  Yeah, they real sickos. [MN]
L:  Yeah, that's what scared me, the fact that they was then -- just that crazy. [LAUGH] You just wanted them to run into a crowd with a bomb on you and blow yourself up or just fly a buil- -- a airplane right on into a building, just so you can take more people out with you for a statement.  You're a terrorist, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's scary as hell.
L:  It is.
R:  I can't imagine what it must be like to live in a country where they do that almost every day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like Israel, that must be really scary.
L:  I tell you when everything's cool up here in Harlem, I don't know if you notice, it seems like there's a Arab store on every corner.  And that's another thing that had me kind of scared too, what if they all was setting this up for a long time?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I hear what you're saying.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, because a lot -- a lot of these people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are the people with money --
L:  Mhm --
R:  -- you never know what they're doing.
L:  -- that's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there're all those stores, you happen to go up, this city will be gone.  'Cause I know, you notice there's a lot of 'em  own them stores, right?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Those are people with money, those sort of people smuggle people in and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're absolutely right.  I wasn't worried --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I just -- you know, I just felt bad for so many families and companies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and all the people --
L:  I love my family too.
R:  -- losing their job.  And the other thing that really changed in my life was I lost my job 'cause of that.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Our business depended on a lot of those financial companies that -- that -- that closed because, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they -- they were destroyed.
L:  Another thing too, me too, I got closer to a lot of my family that don't live in New York at that time, 'cause all of 'em wanted to call, you know, to find out if we was all right and, you know, after that, you know, after we done told them and going on here, then we k- kind of kept in touch.  So, that was another big kind of change.
R:  Well, that's true, you ap- --
L:  Yeah, and then they kept -- 
R:  -- you appreciate your family more --
L:  -- in touch after that, you know?
R:  -- you appreciate your life a little bit more --
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  -- your life, you today -- today you're here, tomorrow you could be gone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You gotta live it a little bit better, somehow, I guess, you know, you think you'll live to a ripe old age -- here it was, twenty year olds, eighteen year olds and just about everybody else, you know, from old to young --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- was that -- were dead in a matter of minute- --
