R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Chanel.
L:  I'm Bonnie.
R:  Hi, Bonnie. [LAUGH] Well, um, we're supposed to talk about our health and fitness.  Do you exercise?
L:  Um, occasionally, not -- not really consistently but --
R:  Not really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I'm in the same boat.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've been trying to lose weight ever since my -- uh, my daughter was born and so we -- we occasionally go on walks together and things like but mostly my exercise is, like, housework and things like that so ...  Yeah.  If you were gonna start a program what would you do?
L:  Well, um, I just recently bought -- I don't know if you've seen those infomercials on TV for the Gazelle?
R:  A -- a gobelle?
L:  A Gazelle.
R:  Oh, a Ga- oh, you know what I have seen those with that, um -- is it the --
L:  Tony Little.
R:  -- same, Tony -- Tony Little or ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have one of those.  I've got, like, the cheap version that I got from Kmart and then I don't know if you've seen the infomercials for Zoom Bust --
R:  Mm mm.
L:  -- I've got those and they're like dance, like a Latino dance.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And those are fun but --
R:  [LAUGH] You use --
L:  -- sometimes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Do you use your -- your -- your Gazelle machine?
L:  Yeah, my husband uses it a little bit more than I do but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [LAUGH] yeah, it -- it's all right and then the tapes -- I don't know sometimes it's hard because I have a two year old daughter --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and she just -- she just wants to like, "Mama, hold me" instead of letting me do anything so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, it's hard to -- my girl will be -- she'll be two in, um, in September --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and that's the same thing.  I mean, I -- I -- I have some yoga tapes and some, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- aerobics and things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it's kinda hard to -- to do something that requires a lot of action when you've got a little in under your feet, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the whole time.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have a machine called an Air strider and it was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something my mom had gotten, oh, years ago and I kinda borrowed it from her when I -- when I left the house and it -- it's kinda like the -- a Gazelle machine, it -- it's kinda like, uh, you know, you -- you're kinda like a ski machine only it's not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on skis, you know.  And, oh --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not near as lightweight and -- and speedy as that Gazelle thing [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but it kinda does.  And I -- I used to use that all the time and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's the only way I stayed -- I stayed slim, I thought, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- it's sitting in our bedroom and we don't use it very much [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Yeah.  After you have a kid it's kinda hard.
R:  It is.  Right now my daughter is -- is staying with, uh, her, uh, her grandparents while we get a little work done on the house and -- and we've been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- painting and things, 'cause it's hard to even paint the house with a lit- with a toddler around so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're painting and that's about all our exercise is right now is -- is up and down on ladders and [LAUGH] things like -- like that.
L:  Yeah, mine's going up and down the stairs to the apartment. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no.  Are you on a second floor apartment, or a third floor?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like a bore. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, well I bet -- betcha your -- I bet your two year old learned to -- to, uh, climb stairs pretty easy though [LAUGH] then.
L:  Oh yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well we still don't let her go down alone [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  She -- we still have to hold her hand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just to make sure she don't fall down but she tries to, and it's kinda scary but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess having a little kid it kinda gives you exercise, you just --
R:  Yeah, definitely, definitely.
L:  Rounding around after them [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I'm still not skinny but [LAUGH] I'm sure it's exercise [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's kinda -- well, tell me about the -- you said the -- the video -- the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Lat- -- Latino dance that you do.
L:  Oh, the Zumba?
R:  I've never heard of that.
L:  Um, it's just been -- I can't remember this guy's name, um, he, uh, does, uh, a whole series of dances, he runs a club down in Miami --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he does this Latino thing and he does it for beginners, intermediate and advanced and you just do, like, the Salsa and the Zumba and it really gets your heart rate up if you can, I guess [NOISE] deal with it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it kinda -- I mean, at first -- it's not real hard but you've just gotta have the [NOISE] -- I guess the breath to keep up with it --
R:  To keep up with it.
L:  -- because it really does -- yeah.
R:  Yeah, if it doesn't really give you much of a break [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and much of a breather.
L:  Well, it tries to 'cause they try to do slower songs but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you're not used to exercising a whole lot it just kinda wrings you out.
R:  Wears you out.  Yeah, well --
L:  Yeah, and I got the [inaudible] Pilates tapes and those are just like a little too boring for me so ...
R:  Well, I -- I've never done the Pilates.  I've done -- I  mean, I've done yoga --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I like that but I didn't know how hard it would be jus to learn how to do the Pilates but --
L:  It doesn't really look that hard but what I don't like about it's on your own -- you're on your back.
R:  You're on your back the whole time?
L:  Yeah, it looks -- well, what -- I -- I only watched them once --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it looked like you were on your back the whole time and that's just --
R:  Oh my.
L:  I don't really like that, I like to be kinda up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and moving around.
R:  That sounds kinda weird, I wonder what -- I don't I'm kinda tempted -- well, I al- I almost got a tape like that but then I didn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, I have -- I have, uh -- I have a couple of tapes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I just don't watch them.  I don't do 'em enough so I'm afraid to buy any more [LAUGH] because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm afraid I just won't -- well, do you -- did you get your, um, your dance tapes are those -- do they sell those, like, at Kmart or something?  Or Walmart?
L:  Um, I don't know if they sell the Zumba but I think they might --
R:  Oh, you got 'em off the infomercial?
L:  -- when -- yeah.
R:  Oh okay.
L:  Well, what you do is, um, you can, um, you can try 'em for like seven dollars and if you don't wanna 'em you can mail 'em back.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, uh, another thing -- well, I thought I liked but it got kinda boring was the -- have you heard of Walk Away the Pounds?
R:  I think I have.  I think I have.
L:  Yeah, they sell those at Kmart and Hastings and stuff --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and it's really easy.  I thought -- I thought it was gonna take forever but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it went by really quick.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  So, Walk Away -- the one mile went by quick at least.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It -- but it's a tape that you watch though?
L:  Yeah, you just stand there and you don't do much it's -- you just stand there and walk and --
R:  But you're walking -- mhm.
L:  Yeah, you just do a few kicks and that's it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's -- it's nothing hard.
R:  Well, does it get your heart rate up at all though?
L:  Yeah, it does. 
R:  It does?
L:  It does.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's gotta be worth I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it sounds like --
L:  Well, they've got this --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They've got the two and the three mile ones but those take forever.  One's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the two mile's half an hour and the three mile's forty eight minutes.
R:  [NOISE] Oh my.
L:  So, if you wanna watch that long and have enough time --
R:  Well, that's the thing, you don't normally have that much time when you got a little child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I don't and, I mean, I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've -- I've tried to do my -- my exercise tape, like, before she wakes up or -- or -- but after she goes to bed I'm too tired --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to do 'em then too so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And it's almost getting too hot around here to go -- I used to take her in her stroller and go out jogging or walking but it's, uh, it's just about getting too hot and humid to do that very much but --
L:  Yeah [NOISE], I understand.  I live in New Mexico [LAUGH].
R:  Oh my, well you -- I -- I live over on the -- on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it's just getting so hot and so humid so fast.  I mean, I know -- springtime, there was no spring [LAUGH].  We went right into summertime.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, no, you don't have the humidity but -- do you?  But is it just a real hot heat though?
L:  Um, kind of.  Um, it depends on what area you live and right now I've had my cooler on because we don't have air conditioning.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's just a portable cooler and it makes the whole house humid.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Except for the part that it's blowing on so -- [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that's another reason why I haven't done anything [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  It's too hot.
R:  It's too hot, you're already sweaty, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, I don't know, we've got -- I have a father in law who every time he calls he -- he -- he also asks, uh, "Well, what's your exercise program like?" [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know why but he's always asking us what we're doing 'cause sometimes he'll be lifting weights or doing something like that and usually I just have to tell him we're not doing anything just --
L:  Yeah, my husband really likes to lift weights.
R:  Really?
L:  Whenever he has time -- he works a lot but he has his weight bench and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he likes to do that and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know I tried doing the weights and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was good but then we moved and I think they're packed away somewhere --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm not really sure where they are.
R:  Yeah, I've never really, uh -- I've never gone and bought my own weights.  I used to -- we used to have a membership at the YMCA --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it wasn't too far away from us so we used to go there but -- but I had a little girl and I had never put her in daycare or anything like that before and so I would leave her there for, you know, an hour at a time in their little daycare and -- and she did okay but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it got -- it was kinda hard with her being so little and -- and then I -- and then I ended up not using it for, like, a month so we just cancelled it [LAUGH] because we weren't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going.  But it was kinda neat to have the whole -- the whole gym there, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything but do you have one of those close to you or -- or not?
L:  [NOISE] I have no idea.
R:  No idea.
L:  I -- I've lived here for eight months only and I have no idea if there's a gym around.
R:  Oh my.  You haven't done much exploring yet? [LAUGH]
L:  No, I guess not. [LAUGH]
R:  We're -- we're fixing to move to Fort Worth and actually I may be going there next week to look for a place to live, we're kinda in -- in the middle of getting --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- things settled and -- and I can't wait to go driving around and -- and explore and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- find a place to live and -- and work and things.
L:  Is Fort Worth by Dallas?
R:  Huh?
L:  Is -- where is Fort Worth by, is it by Dallas?
R:  Yeah, it's -- Fort Worth and Dallas are kind of connected.  They're, um, I mean, they're -- they're two huge cities that kinda grow in together.  I mean, I think there's -- I think technically there's maybe thirty, forty five minutes between 'em but you -- you never know really when you -- when you leave one and enter the other one really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've got a couple of aunts that live there and my husband has a lot of family there, Fort Worth, so ...
L:  Oh, well, maybe there's a huge mall [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to walk around the mall.
R:  That's true, yeah.  You see, you know what, my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- friend and I, she, um, had a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- baby about the same time I did, about five months later --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we used to take our kids and go walking in the mall because, like, the mall would open, like, at nine before the stores open at ten and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that was kinda nice.  Sometimes it got a little bit crowded and, um, and -- and down here when it gets so hot yo- and you can't wa- take your kids out for very long or they all get overheated, so we would go to the mall but I haven't started that yet again.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, you know, some -- you know, we were at a mall in Mobile, Alabama and -- and they had, like, mile markers m- marked on the wall so I'm not sure where you had to start from but wherever you came in, at your entrance, though they would make like a quarter mile and a three quarter mile and every ...
