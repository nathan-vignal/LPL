R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi, I'm Nancy.
L:  [SIGH] Hi, I'm Aquila.
R:  Hi, Aquila.
L:  Hi, how are you? [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm fine thank you.
L:  [SIGH] I --
R:  I -- have you done this before?
L:  [SIGH] No, have you?
R:  Oh, no, this is my first time too.
L:  Me too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good.
R:  [SIGH] It is a little nerve wracking.
L:  Yeah, I'm like, "Huh, okay". [LAUGH] 
R:  I know. [SIGH] So, anyway, do you, um, [LIPSMACK] exercise?
L:  [SIGH] No, you know, actually I don't, but, like, everybody sees me and like, "Oh, wow, how much do you work out?"  'Cause everyone's like, "oh, you have the perfect frame" but I don't exercise at all.  What about you?
R:  I don't, I don't.  In fact, I have --
L:  [COUGH]  
R:  --a, um, treadmill that is in my garage --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- right now.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I've been saying to my husband, "I need it back inside" but it's like, "Where do we put it so it's not in the way?"
L:  Yes, and that's --
R:  You know.
L:  -- the same thing, like, in my house -- well, I stay with my parents --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and we have, like, all this exercise equipment, like, ab rollers and [SIGH] treadmills, I mean, it's like sitting in the living room with, like, the TV and it's --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- like, "Where does that big chunky thing go?"
R:  Exact- and I really like the treadmill, though.  I had it in my bedroom [SIGH] and I would get up early in the morning and -- and get on it and it was, like, no excuse --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because I have a daughter who's five and [SIGH] I couldn't get up and go walking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that was my excuse not to do any exercise at all --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when she was [MN] little and before the treadmill [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I couldn't leave her alone in the house [LAUGH] but [SIGH] -- but no, I'm very bad about it and --
L:  Yeah, me too, and I actually -- I had a gym membership, like I -- I'm -- I used to move around a lot, so [SIGH] I used to have a gym membership for, like, Ballies[?] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, like, a couple of other ones [SIGH] but then, I mean, who wants to y- I mean, really who wants to work out, you know?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  And then it's like, then you have to go work out and [SIGH] like, you go in -- in there and then it's, like, all these women with these thong things on --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- [SIGH] and then all the guys are, like, sweating and panting.  I mean, I don't want o go in there --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and see that --
R:  I know.
L:  -- stuff. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I thought you'd -- just even if you do it at your own house it's more -- it's -- like, it's just a habit, you know, and if you really do it long enough and you do see results, and even if you don't need to lose weight but just the muscle tone --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, it does get to be habit and you want stay like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's like chicks starting a diet.
L:  Exactly, but my -- my thing is -- 'cause it's seems like [SIGH] once I started exercising, it was like, oh, you know, a way of life.  Like, I just like, "Okay, yeah, [SIGH] I go to work and I exercise" and it was not a big deal but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but then when I stopped it's like all over.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [SIGH] And it's, like, now I'm trying to start back and I'm like, "Well, maybe I just get --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- get up and I put on --" [SIGH] like, I try to do this, I was like, "Well, let me just put on my tae bo tape [SIGH] and I'll just do, like the first eight counts". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And I'm like, "One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- okay that's enough".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  So, that didn't go well. [LAUGH] 
R:  But have you ever done anything else?  I mean, you -- you've done, um, like, the fitness thing and -- and tae bo, but, um, I mean, do you bike, do you hike, do you [SIGH] -- anything like that?
L:  No, I mean, like, when I was in school, I did, like, the band and I stayed really active, I was in track, I was always active, so once I graduated college --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] it was just kinda like, "Wow" you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "I guess I have to join a gym or something" and I don't really, [SIGH] like, need to exercise  --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as far -- I mean, I need to for my body --
R:  Right.
L:  -- maintenance, but not like -- you know, people exercise to lose weight --
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  -- or stuff like that.  Not really, I will just do it just more of -- [SIGH] you know, just to keep myself in healthy shape --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or something like.
R:  Yeah, well, that should really be the main reason anyway, shouldn't it, for anybody?
L:  Yeah, really, sure. [LAUGH] 
R:  But, uh, yeah, my -- my other exercise is chasing around my five year old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But that's a- that's about it.
L:  That's enough for you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] honestly. [SIGH] But, uh, yeah, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I h- I know all these people though that, I mean, they religiously -- I know a girl who, you know, leaves her house at five AM every --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- morning --
L:  [SIGH] Oh g-
R:  -- to go and exercise before she goes to work.  And I'm like, "Man".  You know, and she's --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- married, doesn't have kids [SIGH] but even so, you know, I don't know how people -- I -- I -- I need my sleep, five AM's --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a little too early to be leaving the house.
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you, and I'm the same [MN] because I'm -- I know, like the last guy I -- I kinda dated --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] and he would be, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- getting up at five o'clock to go -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's not like the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- gym was right across the street, [SIGH] it was, like, about thirty minutes away --
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  -- he would go all the way to the gym, exercise from five thirty to six thirty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come back, get ready for work and I'm like--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Is it that serious?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] "Why can't you just, like, run in place or something?" [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, exactly, or just, you know, go -- go walk out -- outside, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- do you plan on starting a program in the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- future?
R:  I need to get this treadmill inside and it --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my husband just gave me a dirty look and [SIGH] -- and I said, "Well just " you know, because he doesn't want it in the bedroom and -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I really need to say to him, you know, "Get it in here, we -- I do need to get on it".
L: Yeah. 
R:  [SIGH] I use the, um -- I -- I -- I [SIGH] -- I need to lose, oh, maybe about another fifteen, twenty pounds, if that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, maybe fifteen pounds --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- and after -- if I lose fifteen pounds I'd probably be, um, [MN] a little to thin, [SIGH] [NOISE] but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, so I don't have a lot that I'd like to lose, but I've gotten myself on the, um, Atkins diet --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and -- and I really like it, and it's not the -- it's not the Atkins that, [SIGH] um -- you know, that you just eat all high fat stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- but it's, like, just low carbs, and I eat, you know, their -- the bars that they have with low carbs and I am not hungry during the day at all --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I really like it.  And, uh -- but I know that if I were to be on the treadmill along with it, [SIGH] I would lose a lot faster --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Definitely.
R:  But, um -- but it's -- it's pretty good, so I d- I [MN] -- really, just getting the treadmill in -- for me, I have no -- I have a gift certificate here for three months at some place [SIGH] and I know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'll never use it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I won't -- I won't ever find the time to go --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  And then --
R:  -- I -- I need to do other things to find the time to do --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- let alone go off to exercise.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, [LIPSMACK] so --
L:  [SIGH] And I also see, because it's like with me -- like I said, when I was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing it before it was kind of just, like, I didn't have anything else to do, I was trying to, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- meet people in the city [SIGH] and that was kinda like my reason --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for going, but now it's like, [SIGH] I really -- and this is sad, but I probably wouldn't really exercise unless I really needed to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause I mean I figure I walk enough during the day and I -- I'm always on the move anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, that's a bad excuse [LAUGH] --
R:  No, it's not --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- I mean, if you're f- feeling physically fit and everything, and, I mean, me, I really need a lot of muscle tone, I'll tell you that. [SIGH] you know, I mean, I -- I could start w- lifting weights, and I do, um -- um, I do have weights, like, as well, you know, hand weights --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, that I -- I use, like, if -- if I'm on the treadmill, or when I'm the treadmill.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, at the same time, but -- [LIPSMACK] but that's it, that's -- that's -- that's about my extent to [SIGH] -- to exercising --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and being physically fit and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and whatever, so 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, and I know -- like, I actually went to a health club fitness -- a health fitness club, like -- I think it was, like, last week [SIGH] just to get some information 'cause I'm, like -- I really need to at least do something, play basket ball or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and then, I mean, I got discouraged 'cause it's so expensive --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, who has sixty extra dollars per month --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- to pay for a health club membership?  And then it'd be different if it was pretty convenient, like, within ten miles, [SIGH] but it's, like, thirty miles for me.  I'm not -- I mean --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- thirty miles --
R:  It's not, it's --
L:  -- from my job and --
R:  -- it's -- it's --
L:  -- thirty miles from my house.
R:  -- it's just not convenient, is it?
L:  Not convenient, and I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and then I'm like, "Well, I'll just take --" you're right, I'll just, you know, use the treadmill here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or [SIGH] just get a tae bo tape, [SIGH] but then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, [MN]  no. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I'm, like -- if I'm going to do all that I may as well just go outside and walk then it -- it --
R:  And that's a--
L:  -- it's -- it's a circle.  Then I'd be like, "Well, if I'm going to go outside and walk, I might as well join a health club [SIGH] --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- well, if I'm going to join a health club, I might as well "
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, just like a circle. [LAUGH] 
R:  I did, I used to get up early morning before I had my d- uh, I actually adopted my daughter.  Before I adopted my daughter I used to get up every morning and go and walk just in my subdivision and be gone for about thirty minutes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, and it was great, and I really enjoyed it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I lived in Georgia though, and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I'm living in --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- I'm in Atlanta right now.
R:  Oh, well, so am I.
L:  Oh, get out of here, that's cool.
R:  Yeah, oh, that's really funny, okay.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I l- I live south of the airport, you know --
L:  Me too, I live in Sandview.
R:  Oh, that's so funny, I'm in Peach- I'm over by -- uh, between Newin[?] and Peachtree City.
L:  Oh, that is so funny. [LAUGH] 
R:  That is so funny.  I figured that I'm getting somebody, like, from all over the world.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's hysterical.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] But, you know how at the start you're trying to get -- be outside and -- and walking and it's so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- hot at eight --
L:  It is, oh, god.
R:  -- o'clock in the morning.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and it's like, man it's so muggy, I guess it's -- that's my excuse now it's too muggy to w- be outside.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, and then another thing I found too, especially since --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we live in the same area, there aren't any health clubs --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- over here, 'cause I'm more into -- like, I'll just go to the club and [SIGH] get an aerobics class but [SIGH] they don't have twenty four hour fitness out here.
R:  No.
L:  [SIGH] They don't have -- they --
R:  I know --
L:  -- don't even have Ballies.
R:  -- I know one twenty four hour fitness and it's, um, on highway seventy four, uh, like, when you're -- you're going to, um, [LIPSMACK] um, interstate eight five?
L:  I don't even know where that --
R:  If you're coming up from Peachtree City it's not far --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- it's not far from interstate eighty five, it's seventy four.
L:  [SIGH] See, that's not that bad.  I guess for, like -- I mean, they have like girls' gym, but [SIGH] I don't know, and it -- it -- and, like, with me, I'm not good at just like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- going to the gym and just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like standing on a treadmill, because I'd be like, "I can do that at home".  I -- I'm better when I have, like, aerobics class and --
R:  Exactly, I --
L:  -- somebody leading me and [SIGH] --
R:  I think a lot of people do because they think that if they go with somebody they'll do it, or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I mean, like you said, if I had the extra money [LAUGH] I wouldn't be doing this phone call. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exac- okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, what -- you know, exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, [SIGH] but there are other ways to do it and j- you just have to -- you have to be the right frame of mind, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- I had -- my sisters exercise all the time.
L:  Wow.
R:  [SIGH] I mean, they do something, you know, they come home --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't just sit down.  Me, I come home and I'm -- I put my [MN] tusch --
L:  You --
R:  -- in the chair and I try --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not to [SIGH] you know, move too fast, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, may -- it's just different -- different, you know -- [MN] I think again it just goes back to us being in a habit.
L:  Yeah, and I think --
R:  You know?
L:  -- w- also, too, just, like [SIGH] watching what my family did.  Like, I know when I was little, my mum used to always, you know, like five in the morning when she got us up, she'd be in her room [SIGH] doing the exercise from the TV --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and then, I mean, that -- that was with me for a while, but, like, now everybody just gets up and nobody exercises here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's kinda like y- you know, in my environment nobody's working out so why should I, [LAUGH] kind of thing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, my other excuse used to be that if I would try to do, like, floor exercises --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I have labradors --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and they would be all over me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I could not -- I -- I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- could not sit on the floor for the dogs --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- coming and walking on me and licking my face and everything, so --
L:  That is hilarious.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, and then I'd put 'em outside and they'd bark through the window to come back in, so --
L:  That is [LAUGH] --
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, you -- I mean, you'd come up with an excuse.
L:  Yeah, my --
R:  [LAUGH] You can find any excuse.
L:  Exactly, for my w- for a while mine was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I was like, [SIGH] "Well--"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- [SIGH] I'm not doing tae bo".
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] And then I saw my mum when I -- she was in her bed, [SIGH] and she was like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing sit ups, and I'm like, "Mama, what are you doing?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She was like, "I'm doing sit ups in the bed --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- I'm exercising".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So here I go, [SIGH] next time I get into bed, and I'm like, you know, tired and I lay there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I read a book at the same time and I'm like, "Let me just do some sit ups here". [MN] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] And, um, I'm like, "This is just too lazy [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- too lazy to got on the floor I got to sit -- get in my bed --"
R:  [MN] 
L:  "-- and try to like crunch my stomach". [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  So, probably it's just more me being lazy than anything else.
R:  It -- it is for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is for me even though I know -- and I -- I guess that I know that if I really want to get back into --into this again [SIGH] and have the treadmill inside and really get on it, I would do it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] but I have to d- I have to make the effort to get --
