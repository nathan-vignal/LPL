L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, there, it's Kiki[?] from North Carolina.
R:  I'm Lisa, from Oklahoma. 
L:  Wow, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess we're supposed to talk about het- health and fitness. 
L:  Ah, yeah, if we're doing it regularly or not. 
R:  Well, I need to be, but I'm not. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  You know, it was so weird 'cause I was actually thinking about it as I was riding home, as I am now.  I was like, "Man --"
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it was like, you know, I need to --
R:  I've had two kids so I need to -- I mean, I'm not overly big, but I just -- I need to lose a few pounds around --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- my stomach area.  Huh?
L:  Yeah.  I understand.  I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- have a child too and, well, you know, once you --
R:  It's amazing how it throws your body out of whack after having -- I was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just getting back down to my regular size after my first and then I got pregnant again and then, well ... [LAUGH] 
L:  And just sort of [inaudible] came on out -- back out, uh?
R:  Yeah, it sure did. 
L:  I know.  I understand.  And then when you have little ones, it's just so hard to --
R:  Oh, I know.  And especially --
L:  You know.
R:  -- if you don't have a lot of money.  You can't -- I mean, 'cause I ha- -- if I don't wanna eat what the kids eat, you know, I have to -- wanna eat better, it costs more money to buy different things for, you know, me and then buy stuff for the kids and stuff for my husband and ...
L:  I know.  I thought the same thing --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and someone told me once, you know, long ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it was, like, you know, you either pay now or you pay later. 
R:  That's true.  My dad --
L:  And I was like --
R:  -- died of a massive heart attack at forty seven, so I believe that. 
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah, he was forty seven.  Died of a massive heart attack right in our living room, so it was --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- it was an eye opener for me, but --
L:  [inaudible] And I've got --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so many, you know, family members with diabetes --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- now and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, and they're overweight and, you know, so many health problems --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, high blood pressure, and all that expensive medicine that they gotta take --
R:  Oh, oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, so then it was like, okay, eat or take medicine. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, the pills are so expensive.  I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, if I can avoid that at any cost, I certainly will".
R:  Oh, yeah, it's -- I'm not a person that has a lot of willpower though.  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can't say, "Oh, I'm gonna" -- I'll say something, "I'm going to start a new [NOISE]" and a week later it's, like, "Oh, okay, well, that didn't work".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's tough for me too 'cause -- what -- my best friend -- she's, um, training for a triathlon --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, you know, she's all, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- active and s- -- biking twenty, thirty miles --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- my Lord.
L:  -- running and swimming, and I was like, "Oh, gosh".  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, we -- you know, "Can we go for a walk?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and that was like a joke to her now, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- but back in the days --
R:  Can we just go --
L:  -- that was like --
R:  -- walking?
L:  -- major exercise for us.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "Can we just go walking?" [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, she's all, like, it's just a stroll for her, I'm huffing and puffing. 
R:  Yeah, there's -- I mean, I have a bike that I was riding, but my husband started working double shifts and I don't have anyone else to take care of the kids, so ...
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, I can't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just go off and bike ride, so ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I don't have the money for a gym membership.  I mean, there's always things you can do at the house, but there's always, you know, "Oh --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- I have to clean the house" or, "Oh, the kids are bugging me" or ...
L:  I was thinking, you know --
R:  Something on T.V. I wanna watch. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I think a lot of times -- sometimes, um, you know, as far as like if you can't get out of the house --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then, you know, maybe like a, you know, like a exercise tape --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- you know, whatever, they're -- they're pretty --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- you know, and they're pretty affordable.  You know, you just, you know, get one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that just -- one -- one you like. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's hard to find one you like though. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know. 
R:  I used to buy --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- 'em after the birth of my first child.  It was -- and I never really found -- the ladies were just too peppy and --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Not a lot of --
R:  Not really me, you know.
L:  -- people at your fitness level, everybody's so --
R:  All their skin hanging out with bikinis and that's just not me.  Even when I was skinny, I didn't have my skin hanging out everywhere --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- so ... [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that's one thing I liked about Tai Bo, when I did it more regularly, is the fact they have people of all -- all fitness levels.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like, everybody couldn't finish the exercises --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I really liked that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, there was some people there that were really fit, but there was some people in the back who was straight struggling. 
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  I was like, "Yeah, that's me". [LAUGH] 
R:  That'd be me too. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, me and you'd be right in the back struggling for breath. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] Exactly. 
R:  I would, yeah.
L:  But, hey, hey, you're active though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  You don't get the -- get the -- how old are your kids?
R:  Ah, my son is four and my daughter's eight months. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Boy, I guess you'd have to do it --
R:  -- I'm sure I'd be getting a lot more --
L:  -- during nap time.
R:  -- exercise here lately once she starts walking.  Which'll be in the next couple of months, so ...
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Y- y- you'll get plenty. 
R:  She doesn't crawl yet, but she rolls everywhere and, I mean, I can put her down one place and I'm running after her.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  She goes everywhere.  That's my exercise routine for now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I believe it. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [MN] picking 'em up, boy, if that -- if that's not lifting weights --
R:  Oh, and she's heavy, she's twenty one pounds, so I mean --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- my son was, like, twenty one pounds when he was almost two and she's big.  I can't hold --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- her for very long at all 'cause she really is a load.  She's big. 
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  Just lift her up --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- a few times and that'll be my weight exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Li- li- lift her a little bit, like you'd life weights --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, lift her up in the air a couple times. 
R:  Oh, yeah.  She's --
L:  You know. 
R:  -- she's a big girl.  She's a big girl. 
L:  Wow.  Well, yeah, I'm -- and I'm -- I'm the classic person that has a gym membership, don't use it. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Got one of those super saver --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- deals where it's really, really, really cheap --
R:  Yeah, and you never go, huh?
L:  -- and I still don't go.
R:  [LAUGH] I had that one time.  When I worked at a hospital they, ah, let all their, um --
L:  Employees [inaudible].
R:  -- hospital employees join this really nice gym over here, um, for, like, five dollars a month.  It was like --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- or no, five dollars out of every pay check.  And we got paid --
L:  Okay. 
R:  -- every two weeks, which was, still, ten dollars a month.  And, I mean, this was a nice club.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It had hot tubs and, I mean, it was --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- sauna rooms, I mean, it was a really nice club.  But I never went.  I had 'em taking it out of my check, but, I mean, I worked three to eleven every night. 
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, by the time I got home, you know, at night I was tired, I wanted to sleep until nine or ten in the morning, so I never really used it.  And, see, now that I don't work any more, I just stay at home with the kids, I don't get that discount any more, now when I really wanna --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- go.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I think now -- I think now is more of a -- you have to -- you gotta make a decision --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then you have to figure out something that's workable.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, it's really gotta be something that --
R:  Something you can stick to, not set --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- unreal- unrealistic things, you know. 
L:  Right.  Something you --
R:  Like me, I say, "Oh, I'm not going to eat fast food no more".  Well ...
L:  Oh, well.
R:  I take him to McDonalds, and it's like, "Well, maybe I'll just get that big Mac". [LAUGH] 
L:  And just a little fry.
R:  [LAUGH] That's my --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- that's -- that's my main problem is fast food.  Because we're always busy and --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- we're always --
L:  -- kinda on the go.
R:  Exactly.  We've always got something to do and that's my -- my downfall is fast food. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do really good on sweets and chocolate and I -- I don't eat that as much as I used to, it's just the fast food.
L:  [MN]
R:  That's gonna be my main problem.  If I could cut out most of my fast food, I'd probably do pretty well. 
L:  Hm.  Well, maybe --
R:  But it's just --
L:  -- you could start out with, like, one thing at a time.  
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  You know, like one thing you like, have a little less --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  -- you know, or, you know, one less, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the fries, 'cause me, I'm -- fries get me. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I -- I'm just a sucker for a good fry --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- especially from, you know, McDonalds or somewhere like --
R:  I don't know if you've ever had any of the Outback [COUGH] -- they have cheese fries, it's one of their -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- appetizers, you know.  Have -- do you --
L:  Really?
R:  -- have an Outback where you live?
L:  Yes, we do.  We have an Outback. 
R:  Okay.
L:  I try not to go often 'cause I really go crazy. 
R:  [LAUGH] And they're so expensive. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, that too. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But the thing is, they give you so much.
R:  Oh, I know. 
L:  You know, like holy sh- --
R:  Well, they have this appetizer, it's their cheese fries, and oh, my God, they're -- they got cheese and bacon and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- oh --
L:  -- God.
R:  -- they bring 'em out with this ranch dressing and it is just so good. 
L:  I think I've had 'em one time --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- before and I [inaudible] --
R:  -- they're so good.
L:  -- I was like, "I can't eat these". 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "I can't eat these any more". 
R:  That was when I was pregnant.  I ate 'em all the time.  I'm like, "Well, this is my excuse to eat 'em all the time". [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I remember that.  I was like, "I'm eating for two, so I can have --"
R:  Exactly.
L:  "-- a little more".
R:  Leave me alone.  My husband was like, "Don't you think you ate a little bit too much?" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Would you ever take any diets pills or anything?  I'm too scared to. 
L:  Well, you know --
R:  With all the different --
L:  -- I had -- I had thought about -- I'd actually -- 'cause I work a whole lot, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was really trying to, you know, be able to be active and actually stay awake --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I took --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- um, the, um, the Xenadrine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was kinda like the hyrog- -- 'cause it's kinda like one of those --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- get you pepped up so you can exercise more.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, 'cause you're so wired you wanna run around. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But -- but I felt it was -- it made -- it had me too up.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I was just bouncing off the wall, like, this is not safe.
R:  Well, I've heard a lot of people who have taken Ephedra and they, like, have heart problems and -- or they had an undiagnosed heart condition and --
L:  I believe it. 
R:  Crazy.
L:  'Cause it really gets your heart rate racing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It really does.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So you really have to --
R:  Well, I mean, that's what they --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- that's what they give, like, when I worked in the hospital, if somebody's heart is stopped, they give them Ephedrin[?] [MN].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Ephedra --
L:  Wow. [MN]
R:  -- is like the pill form.  It's not as strong, but I mean, they give --
L:  Right, it's just --
R:  -- Ephedrin --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- to people to, you know, start their heart back again. 
L:  Oh, that's deep[?].
R:  Oh, I know.  And that's why I'm always too scared and -- I -- I hear all these -- these stories, you know and they're coming out with all this stuff that's Ephedra free now.  And it's like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, how do you know if it's really, really safe?  It's not even approved by the F.D.A. and --
L:  Yeah, and none of it is really.
R:  -- I've got two kids, I don't wanna die just trying to --
L:  Trying to lose weight. [LAUGH]
R:  -- lose weight, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  What would be the purpose?  You're lo- -- trying to lose weight so you can live longer and then --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Crazy.
L:  Yeah, and I think they --
R:  A friend of mine's husband took Pondamen[?] a long time -- when, you know, whenever the Pondamen[?] thing --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- was out.
L:  -- like the Redux[?] --
R:  And he --
L:  -- Fen Phen stuff.
R:  Yeah, he has, um, cardiomyopathy, which is like a --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- basically he's in heart failure and is on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a heart transplant list from it.  And he's gonna get a rather large settlement from the com-
