L:  [NOISE] Hi, this is Robyn.
R:  Hi, Robyn, I'm Catherine.
L:  Hi, Catherine, how are you?
R:  I'm fine, how are you? [SIGH] 
L:  I'm fine.  Where am I calling, who am I -- I mean, where do you live?
R:  [LAUGH] I live in --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- California and [SIGH] I actually got a call last night on the recording [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then nobody connected --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- probably 'cause it was memorial day.
L:  Oh, I just do -- I had the same experience.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I was just waiting, waiting, waiting.
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I'm glad I'm not the only one.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  W- what part of California are you in?
R:  Um, I am near Los Angeles, in -- in a suburb [SIGH] and, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Oh, we're neighbors then, I'm in Los Angeles. [SIGH] 
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I though everybody [SIGH] was --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- calling from Pennsylvania. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] No, I got someone from Alaska, I got someone from Missouri, I got someone from [SIGH] Redding, California, so we're --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- actually neighbors. [LAUGH] 
R:  Huh, that's great. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, [SIGH] the topic is health and fitness.
R:  Uh-huh, that's --
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  -- a great topic.
L:  It is, [SIGH] and I guess one question was do we exercise regularly, and then, what do we do?
R:  Okay.  Well, [SIGH] I actually had, um, [LIPSMACK] a back injury in December [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- an, uh, I had, um, [LIPSMACK] two herniated discs, [SIGH] and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- yeah, and I had some injections and then, um, [SIGH] he put me into physical therapy, which, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he had me do three times a week and, uh, finally the pain's gone away, [SIGH] probably about three weeks ago, so they've just taken me into the gym, [SIGH] because it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- right next to a gym.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so they're, [SIGH] um, giving me exercises on the equipment and on balls, and it's like -- it is so positive and I feel so good and energized when I leave there. [SIGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I am just really looking forward to, um, [LIPSMACK] continuing.  Uh, [SIGH] I have a membership at a gym which I've never really used, [SIGH] but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, as soon as, um, this physical therapy is over I'm definitely going to get a personal trainer and [SIGH] go to the gym because it's just -- [LIPSMACK] I mean, if you're feeling kind of down [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just really [SIGH] improves your perception of things, so I'm --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- just all for exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's great.  Well, I know I walk every day, I just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- love it. [SIGH] I cannot replace walking with anything.  That -- that is what --
R:  Where do you --
L:  -- I live for.
R:  -- like to walk?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, gosh, I walk [MN] from -- everywhere from Beverley Hills to the south bay. [SIGH] I just -- wherever -- whichever area I live in at the time, which -- right now I live in Culver City, so -- [SIGH] now, I'm just walking --
R:  [SIGH] We are --
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  -- neighbors, I work in Westwood. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] Oh, really? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] No, I just walk round Sony Studios, I just, you know -- my husband and I just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we love it.  We walk all over.  We lived in Beverley Hills at one time, so [SIGH] every time we walk the entire area we move and then we [LAUGH] -- we walk the area in which we move, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's just great.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] We just [LAUGH] love walking, period. [SIGH] But I also think another important exercise is a spiritual exercise. [SIGH] I like to meditate, so you have to have your mental health as m- as well as your physical health. [SIGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I totally agree --
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  -- with you.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] So, it has to be a whole package, you can't just go to the gym --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] Arnold Schwarzenegger, and not having anything upstairs. [LAUGH]  
R:  How long have you been --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- meditating?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, for years, [SIGH] just, mm, I would say at least -- well, I think all my life, 'cause I've always appreciated quiet time. [SIGH] It's just very important to have your connection with God. [SIGH] 
R:  I [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] I -- I -- I agree with you --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and, um, I, um [SIGH] -- I want to start yoga and Pilates because that's also --
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  -- good for the breathing and to strengthen the back [SIGH] and --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- and I do like to walk too and I -- I never like to go into the gym, actually, because I like to be outside.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  [SIGH] And there's a nice lake, uh, near where I live, with ducks --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] but unfortunately it's concrete, so right now --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's not good for my back.  She recommends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, grass or dirt.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, um -- [SIGH] but I do want to start getting into meditation and I -- actually, have you heard of Doctor Andrew Wheel?
L:  [SIGH] Of course I have. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  The one with the beard? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because, um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- a friend of mine recommended that I get, um, [LIPSMACK] some tapes of his at Barns and Noble and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they -- they are on, uh, meditation, [NOISE] where --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they teach you how to meditate.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So, I -- I'm really excited about doing that.
L:  [SIGH] And you don't actually have to be taught how to meditate.  If you can just get some quiet time and go within, [SIGH] there's really nothing to it.  I mean, no one can actually tell you how to meditate, that's [SIGH] a personal connection you have with your inner self. [SIGH] You know when if you say, "Catherine, I want you to [SIGH] go inside and think about me, Andrew Wheel". [LAUGH] You -- they can't do that, it's just your connection with your higher being or your spiritual path. [SIGH] If you and God --
R:  You do sound very spiritual and very calm, I'm wondering if you just finished meditating? [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] No, just -- I just came up from my walk. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  And I said, "Oh, I'd better try someone before eleven" because I think they cut off at eleven --
R:  It is.
L:  -- for the -- for the research.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] No, I just -- I'm always aware of, you know, me and God and nothing else really matters.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] If you start with that connection then all your other connections in life will be fruitful.
R:  [SIGH] Do you meditate in the morning?
L:  [SIGH] I am not a morning person, I actually --
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm not either.
L:  -- I [LAUGH] -- I prefer, mm, the afternoon to early evening. [SIGH] [NOISE] That is just -- because I'm a writer, I stay up late at night.  I just do not like mornings, they don't have the right energy for me [SIGH] 'cause there's always a lot of noise, you hear the traffic sometimes, you hear alarm clocks, radio. [SIGH] So, actually, you know, the evening hours or afternoon hours are better for me.
R:  W- what do you, uh, write? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I am a screen writer.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I didn't know, like, if you wrote for magazines or if you wrote articles on health or --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- spirituality, so I wasn't sure. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Uh, I have written articles on dreams and things like that.  I have been published, but [SIGH] I'm just concentrating on screen writing right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] So, that's my next step.
R:  So you have analyzed dreams before? [SIGH] 
L:  I have.
R:  [LAUGH] I just --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- wrote my dream down I had last night.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] What kind of dream did you have?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it was --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] it was not a pleasant dream, it was --
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  -- you know, it was so funny because my, um -- [LIPSMACK] my therapist told me, and she actually analyses dreams. [SIGH] that, um, the people in the dream, it's not about them, tho- those are, like, parts of myself [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm, [SIGH] mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, [SIGH] it was funny, um, the -- the maid came over yesterday and she cleaned and [SIGH] I was looking for something in the bathroom and I saw [SIGH] under the cabinet this, um, like, bath pillow, that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you blow up, [SIGH] but it was deflated and it's got, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- these suction --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cups on the back of the pillow.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So, um, I was having this dream last night, and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my, uh -- my ex boyfriend, [LIPSMACK] um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- he -- I -- I saw him and he was very angry at me [SIGH] and when I left, all of a sudden, [SIGH] pillow, like, the bath pillow got, like, stuck on my back [SIGH] and, like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the suction was like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- getting tighter and tighter --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] so I couldn't breath --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I'm walking around with this --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- bath pillow stuck on my --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- back. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's very telling, that's why he's your ex.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  He sucked the life out of you, didn't he? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I've had back problems, so, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, I -- I thought that was pretty interesting, so I'm [SIGH] looking forward to sharing that with my therapist.  I know this does not have --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- to do with exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, no, I mean, it's all mental exercise, spiritual health, mental --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- health.  It's all this -- in the same realm. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think  -- [SIGH] do you know who Louise Hay is?
R:  I just got a book from her --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- my therapist actually, um, has a spiritual bent [SIGH] and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's Heal Your Body A to Z.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And it's the mental causes for physical illness, so I was reading, when my back was really bad, about the back and what it means. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, I think she says when you have back problems you feel you don't have support in you life, [SIGH] which -- it can make sense.  I mean, anything can make sense, but --
R:  I've --
L:  -- it depends on --
R:  -- I've got it right here, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there's different, um, [SIGH] reasons for each area of the back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, the lower, the middle and the upper, and the lower back --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it means a fear of money and lack of financial support.
L:  Oh, really? [SIGH] Wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And the -- and mine was in the lower, and the middle --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is guilt, stuck in all --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that stuff, get off my back. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it sounds like you're on the right track, Catherine.
R:  [SIGH] No, I -- I really am, and, uh -- [SIGH] but I feel like I've been doing most of the talking, so, um -- but it's it --
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm -- yeah, I'm more of a listener anyway.  It's always interesting --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to listen to people. [MN] [LAUGH] [SIGH] I mean, 'cause -- because they can tell this -- tell me their whole life story in [SIGH] very little time. [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I -- I'm actually a listener too, but the things you're saying [SIGH] is where I'm at mentally and spiritually, so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm feeling a connection --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and I want to --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- talk about it.
L:  See, it was meant to happen, we were meant to speak to each other today.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, yesterday the phone was just ringing off the hook, they put us on hold, and no-one
