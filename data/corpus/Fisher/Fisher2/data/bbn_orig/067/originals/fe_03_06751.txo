R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  [SIGH] Hi, my name is Nancy.
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  Who am I talking to?
L:  This is Beverley from West Virginia.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm c- I'm in California.
L:  Oh, my --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  We got a big difference.
R:  [SIGH] Exactly.  So, for me, it's, like, quarter past three in the afternoon, [SIGH] and --
L:  Uh, it's just --
R:  -- for y-
L:  -- after six here. 
R:  Oh, my goodness --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so, dinnertime.
L:  No, we don't --
R:  -- [SIGH] And, now, I'm act- I'm actually from the east cost.  I've only been out here a couple of years, [SIGH] so, uh, you know, I have to keep in mind everything that's going on on the east coast.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  It's affected us [MN] big time --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- the nine one one, so 
R:  [SIGH] It really did?  Even though you're that far away form New York City?
L:  Well, we're not s- we're not really that far.  Washington DC isn't [MN] --
R:  Isn't that far?
L:  No, 'cause we're up towards --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- uh, [SIGH] I'm real close to --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- Maryland when --
R:  I see.
L:  -- I get to that.  So, [SIGH] in sixth grad and everything, which --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I'm fifty, was a long time ago, we would go there --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- for our sixth grade graduation, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, to us, it's not that bad.
R:  [MN] Right, right.
L:  [SIGH] The only --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- big thing -- my husband and I was going for our thirtieth anniversary to --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- London [SIGH] and --
R:  [SIGH] And you were going to go -- you were going to go right after September eleven? [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, and I could not do it.
R:  Oh, no --
L:  [SIGH] I c-
R:  -- I don't blame you.
L:  I have been on so many planes, I have flown [LIPSMACK] overseas a lot, but I just could not do it.
R:  [SIGH] Isn't that something? [SIGH] now, have you started to fly again, or no?
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you haven't, you don't want to g-
L:  No, [SIGH] I s- no, I would do it if I had something big like that, [SIGH] 'cause --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we didn't get our money refunded or anything, it was --
R:  Oh, that's terrible.
L:  -- uh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm surprised --
L:  But --
R:  -- about that.
L:  Nope, I [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH] Well, what had happened to me, [SIGH] I have a sister who lives just outside of Boston, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] so the two of us had gone to France, [SIGH] of all places, on --
L:  [SIGH] OH.
R:  -- a two week vacation. [SIGH] so, I flew out of Boston on [SIGH] August twenty second.  And then on September eleventh, [SIGH] the two planes that took off from Boston [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  -- are the ones that went to the trade center.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And so I though, two weeks earlier I was on, n- not the right same plane, [SIGH] but I was on American Airlines and that was the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- one that went --
L:  Isn't that a bit scary.
R:  -- into the trade center.
L:  Oh, that's terrible.
R:  [SIGH] But, you know, what?  I would get on a plane tomorrow.  I've gone back and forth [SIGH] to the east cost several times. [SIGH] I think I'm a little bit of a fatalist --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that [SIGH] if something's going to happen it's go-
L:  Oh, yeah, it's going to happen, you know, [SIGH] but I just had such a bad feeling --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] uh, [SIGH] after that, that I just could not make myself do it.  But [SIGH] now, I do feel safe now, because they've got all the precautions, you know.
R:  Sure.
L:  [SIGH] They've got the airport pretty well, but [SIGH] I mean, there's idiots in our town, let alone [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, I know, exactly.
L:  -- let alone anywhere else. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly. [SIGH] But what I, uh, kind of would worry about, and I have not been back to Europe, [SIGH] would be that if something happens and you're over there, [SIGH] and something happens here, for instance --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] like, you would feel like you had to stay there [SIGH] because -- like, I m- in -- close to Los Angeles, [SIGH] and what if I couldn't fly back into Los Angeles airport or something.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And it's, like, you kind of want to be home, you don't want to be [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] I'd not thought --
R:  -- three thousand miles --
L:  -- about it that way.  Yeah, that --
R:  Yeah, it's like you could get stuck some place. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, I have friends in New Jersey who [SIGH] [MN] don't even want to go into New York City, [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- because they are saying that, what if they're in the tunnel or something, [SIGH] and they can't get home [SIGH] and it's like they're so near and yet so far.
L:  Oh, that's terrible.
R:  [SIGH] And yet, I -- I don't feel that way.  My feeling is life goes on [SIGH] and, who knows, [SIGH] I could be in New York and it happened in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, yeah, we could get hit --
R:  [SIGH] [MN] --
L:  -- by a car.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And have a heart attack, I mean --
R:  It's -- exactly.
L:  -- [MN] I --
R:  [SIGH] But I didn't lose anybody close to me, did you --
L:  Mm, well --
R:  -- lose an- anybody close?
L:  -- we had a little girl here in our city w- I'm in a -- a smaller city, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [SIGH] Are you near Morgantown, or --
L:  Mm --
R:  -- because you said north?
L:  -- no, I go, um -- we go there quite a bit.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] But it's about an hour and a half drive to there, [SIGH] but there was a girl --
R:  [SIGH] So, are you south of Morgantown or -- [SIGH] or east or west?
L:  [MN] Uh, let's see.
R:  Because I think of --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- Morgantown as, like, being at the top [SIGH] of West Virginia.
L:  Yeah, it is --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- kind of. [SIGH] My mother in law lives right in, uh --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- Davis.  That's a little tiny town, a couple of hundred, [SIGH] and --
R:  [SIGH] [MN]  
L:  -- she's just, like, two minutes from Maryland.
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] But I'm -- I'd say an hour and a half from Morgantown.  I'm in Parkersburg, West Virginia. [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but we're on the border of Ohio -- I mean, to me, three minutes, and I'm in -- in Ohio.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But we're kind of in between all of it, but 
R:  Right. [SIGH] But you had a little girl in your town --
L:  Yeah, uh --
R:  -- is that -- [SIGH] well, where was she?  Was she in the building, or what happened?
L:  Yeah, she cal- called a -- her dad's a lawyer here in our town [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and she called them and said she was safe. [SIGH] I think she was, um -- she was an intern --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- working for one of the lawyers there, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a the World Trade Center.
R:  right.
L:  [SIGH] And they didn't know for weeks, and they've dedicated a lot -- they've put up scholarships and stuff, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [SIGH] she was just so beautiful and so -- [SIGH] so smart, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to be doing that. [SIGH] But no one else.  I mean, we had no one, no relatives --
R:  Right, no, no --
L:  -- and so that was --
R:  -- nor did I.
L:  -- there was no one else in our city.  That was the only one, but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- I just -- we just sat in front of the TV, it --
R:  Oh, I did too, I did too. [SIGH] 
L:  Cried and sat there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for all these mothers, the ones that were pregnant and --
R:  Oh, I know. Oh, I know.
L:  And then that -- that one husband that tried to knock the, um -- you know, tried to save the plane from hitting the Pentagon, [LIPSMACK] which they did.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] That was one of the worst things, I think.
R:  Exactly. [SIGH] Uh, have you been to Washington since -- [SIGH] since it happened?
L:  No, no.
R:  No, [SIGH] no.  it's like, and nor have I.  but, uh, interestingly enough, I watched the memorial day, [SIGH] like, service that was on television.
L:  Oh.
R:  [SIGH] It all took place a t the capital and everything on -- [SIGH] I've -- it was on my television on Monday night of this week. [SIGH] And when you saw the capital and everything, you think, "How dare anybody come over?" [SIGH] 
L:  I just can't --
R:  A-
L:  -- imagine the would have --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, they had to plan it for a long time --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I think so.
L:  -- [SIGH] because everything was, you know, at the same time it was all happening, the plane going into the Pentagon, the plane -- you know, all of it.
R:  Right. [SIGH] 
L:  They had to have worked on it.
R:  Right, I think so too, I think so too. [SIGH] But just a -- just the whole thing, [SIGH] it's so amazing that it could happen [SIGH] 'cause we always have felt so [SIGH] invulnerable before then, you know, nothing could happen to us.
L:  I know, I didn't think so.  I really --
R:  Never.
L:  -- I though we were the safest country [SIGH] because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've been to Greece and Turkey and Brazil.  I've been overseas a lot [SIGH] and I didn't feel safe in Turkey because there was a lot of people there [SIGH] with machine guns on top of places.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Really.
L:  [LAUGH] And that was --
R:  Oh, I wouldn't like that.
L:  -- kind of scary.  No, we didn't stay there but just about a half a day.  We didn't stay overnight.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] But it was a -- a cruise we was on, [SIGH] but, I mean, I had always felt safe in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] I didn't think anybody could hurt us like they did.
R:  No, I know, I know. [SIGH] and, um, [SIGH] what I read -- something on the internet yesterday, they said we're at orange right now, which is like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- second to the highest [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they said [SIGH] the longer they keep saying that and nothing happens, you get lazy and you don't do anything.
L:  Oh, no. [SIGH] No, we don't.  I mean --
R:  I mean, I -- I haven't done anything different.
L:  No. [SIGH] Now, there, as far as -- we did bring, um, you know, gallons of water in, thinking, you know, they're going to hit a water supply or something. [SIGH] you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we were stocking up on a few things. [SIGH] Everybody was selling flashlights and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, thinking we might have this blackout from --
R:  [SIGH] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause we've got a lot of power plants here --
R:  Oh, do you really?
L:  -- in our city.  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  We've got Du Pont, we've got a lot of big, uh, [SIGH] chemical factories --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and everyone was afraid, [MN] you know, something would happen, but --
R:  Exactly. [SIGH] But now you're saying people, yourself included, [SIGH] are just not doing anything any different?
L:  No, I mean, it's just --
R:  [SIGH] I mean, so it's in the back of your mind, but it's not -- it's not [SIGH] making you, uh, buy the water and everything like that, then?
L:  No, nothing. [SIGH] And I would go back on a plane now.  The --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, the first six months after that, no way.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] But now, I would go in a second, but --
R:  Right, right. [SIGH] 
L:  -- but I feel we're being protected some, and 
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Oh, I -- I think they're doing the best that they can. [SIGH] and you what my feeling is?  It's going to be like this [SIGH] for the next fifty or a hundred years, who knows?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah. [SIGH] There's all these --
R:  [SIGH] And --
L:  -- idiots out there that --
R:  It -- yeah, exactly, exactly. [SIGH] Now, how about your husband, does he worry about any of this, or ?
L:  No, he does not -- [SIGH] he was ready to go to London [SIGH] but things doesn't bother him, I don't [LIPSMACK] -- my mum and dad was really upset, because my dad --
