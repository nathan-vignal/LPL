L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  H- hello --
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, my name is Samantha.
R:  Hi, Samantha.  My name is Shelly.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, Shelly.  Do you know what topic we're supposed to talk about?
R:  Yeah, I think we're supposed to answer the question right now about whether or not we exercise. 
L:  [NOISE] Whether or not we exercise?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Hold it.  Ca- -- can you call downstairs and tell them to send up food on your cell phone? [NOISE] [SIGH] Um --
R:  Okay, so --
L:  -- I'm trying to. [LAUGH] Sorry.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, I see -- I used to and I stopped because of school but now I'm going to start again over the summer. 
L:  [NOISE] Um, I am getting married in August, so I've been working out [LAUGH] a lot. 
R:  Oh, okay.  That's cool.
L:  But, um, and on Sundays actually my friend comes over to train me at, like, eight o'clock in the morning.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's actually really good.  'Cause people pay a lot of money for personal trainers.
L:  Oh, I know.  Well, it's kinda funny 'cause we're, um, trading. [LAUGH] Personal shopping.  I help him, like, buy clothes.  He's an attorney.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for training.  He's --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- like an old friend of mine. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  And he can't shop for himself, so I shop for him --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and then he helps me train, because I hate -- I hate -- I love -- like, I wanna personal trainer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as I love working out with someone like that.
R:  Okay, well, [inaudible] like, what do you do?  Do you just, like, do, like, exercises, like --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, like --
L:  [SIGH] We --
R:  -- stomach or --
L:  -- yeah, he works, he's teaching me how to use weights 'cause I'm all, like, I'm scared to use weights by myself, so -- but I'm getting a lot more [NOISE] confident with it.  So, we work out with weights together for, um, [LIPSMACK] about an hour --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and do, like, different kind of strength training exercises.  And then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we swim for, like, an hour. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, swimming's actually really good. 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  For, like, the total body workout, whatever. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I love to swim, so, um, [NOISE] it's just, it makes my hair so dry and my skin so dry, but otherwise I love it. 
R:  Oh, yeah. [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah, I'm in -- uh, where are you from, are you from California?
L:  New York.  Are you from California?
R:  Oh, you're from New York?  Yeah, I'm from California. 
L:  Actually --
R:  I didn't know if they were like a --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- local --
L:  My fiance is from L.A.  And, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- eventually I'm going to be moving to California. 
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, when are you -- I think we're supposed to be talking about exercise, so, um, so when --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay, so --
R:  -- do you exercise?
L:  I actually took --
R:  How many times --
L:  -- a Pilates class tonight [LIPSMACK] but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- um, I'm not so good at it and it's hard, because I -- I'm not sure if I'm always doing, like, the right [SIGH] --
R:  What, you're taking the class or you're watching the video?
L:  I'm taking the class in my building.
R:  Okay.
L:  At a gym in -- 
R:  Okay. 
L:  -- my building --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in New York City.  And, um, there's a class [LAUGH] and there's an instructor and there's, like, you know, ten, [NOISE] twelve people, and I'm trying, but it's hard. [LAUGH] I always feel like I'm doing the wrong thing.
R:  Yeah, actually one of my friends does it by -- through video --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she tried to show me once --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I'm not sure she -- if she's doing it right either, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think you have the [inaudible] -- I feel like I am getting stronger and better and -- and the instructor actually told me today that I was doing a lot better, because I've been working out with my friend and getting stronger. 
R:  Mhm. 
L:  You're able to hold the positions better. [SIGH]
R:  Do you think it will, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, what do you think it will improve on, like, in the future?  Like, is it supposed to be some, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stretching thing or, like, muscle building?
L:  It's --
R:  I don't really quite know what it is.
L:  Pilates, it tones you up. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Shapes your body, shapes your muscles and really tones you up. [LIPSMACK] So, do you --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- work out or ...?
R:  Well, I mean, I used to just go to the gym.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I go to school here, so I mean, I used to just go to the gym often and just, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do the treadmill or, like, the pre core --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- and then, like, do some weights and stuff, but I just -- I stopped near the end 'cause I got so much stuff to do.  
L:  I know.
R:  I just couldn't get myself to go. 
L:  It feels -- but I -- I -- I really do feel a lot better now that I've been working out.  At least --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- twice to three times a week for, like, the last couple months. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, I really should. [LAUGH] You're, like --
L:  It feels --
R:  -- inspiration.
L:  -- good, but it is hard, it is hard.  It's hard to get motivated, but I have a dress I have to fit into, so ...
R:  Yeah, yeah, true.
L:  Big motivation. [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I think that's the hardest part. 
L:  [NOISE] What school do you go to?
R:  Oh, I go to U.C. Berkeley.
L:  [NOISE] Okay, my fiance went to U.C.L.A. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's awesome. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did he like it?
L:  Yeah, he loved it.  Loved it. 
R:  Okay.
L:  He's from Hancock Park and, ah, went to s- -- college there and now he wants to go back there, so we'll see.
R:  Yeah, and it's so hot down there though. 
L:  Where? [NOISE] Hot?
R:  Oh, no, in U.C.L.A. 
L:  It's hot?
R:  Yeah, hot, like --
L:  Like, the --
R:  -- the weather.
L:  -- weather?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I was in California three times this year and it was freezing every single time. 
R:  Oh, my goodness. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So weird, cause right now it's so hot.  I just, like, got inside and, like, I'm -- I'm, like, I don't know, the air conditioning's on full blast and everything. 
L:  I mean, I was there in April, but it was --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- wasn't that --
R:  -- well --
L:  But you know what's one of my favorite exercises when, um, we go to California?  We go to Runyon[?] Canyon.  Do you know where that is?
R:  No, actually, where is it?
L:  It's in L.A. in Westwood, I think, in Hollywood.
R:  Mm.
L:  West Hollywood.  And you go, like, up on the canyon and you go, like, hiking.  It's not --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- like hiking, it's like walking up, like, a really steep hill --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- walking back down.  It was, like, hard.  He kicked my butt. 
R:  Man, you must be really, like, in really good shape, 'cause you do a lot. 
L:  [LAUGH] Thanks, I wish I was, but not yet.  I'm on the way. [SIGH]
R:  Wow. 
L:  On the way.
R:  [MN]
L:  Have you ever done these calls before?
R:  Do what?
L:  Have you done these calls before? [NOISE]
R:  No, actually --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- I haven't.
L:  -- okay, this is my first time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Oh, okay. [MN] 
R:  So --
L:  But, um --
R:  Yeah, this is kinda weird.  I think we're supposed to talk --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for ten minutes about the same topic. 
L:  Okay.  So, Runyon Canyon, which is in West Hollywood, is awesome, and it's just like this really steep hill and you walk up and it's, like -- looks like nothing, you're looking at it going, "I can do that".  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was dying by the end -- by the top, I could hardly make it.  Like, my fiance --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- was literally pushing me up.
R:  [LAUGH] So he's --
L:  I mean, I was, like, crying --
R:  -- really into --
L:  -- I was like, "I don't wanna go, I'm not going".  And he's like, "You can do it".  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And afterwards I loved it though, 'cause it's --
R:  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
L:  -- you're outside, you're in nature and [SIGH] I think that's the best --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- way to exercise. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, I just -- oh, I ha- -- I -- I don't really enjoy working out, probably 'cause I never gave myself a chance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I really just have to start.
L:  I don't love it either.  I'm trying to love it, because I've gained so -- I gained, like, thirty pounds in the last year.  And I'm --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- trying to lose it.  
R:  [LAUGH] So, well, good luck.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- obviously you're doing much better than I am, so ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  Thank you.  Well, it's hard when you're going --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- to school.  What are you going to school for?
R:  What?
L:  What are going to school for? [NOISE]
R:  What am I going to school for?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm actually just a freshman, so I just started school.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm a teacher.  I teach first grade.
R:  Oh, that's so cool.  Man, I don't know.  I like school but, mm.  I don't know, [NOISE] it's not all that I thought it was going to be. 
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I love -- I love school.  Obviously. [LAUGH]
R:  Yay.  Yeah.
L:  I'm staying in school for the rest of my life. [MN] But ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, but you teach what grade?
L:  First grade. 
R:  Oh, how's that?
L:  And my kids actually, they have, like, dance once a week and they learn all these yoga positions.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they're really good at it.  It's good.  It's really good for them.
R:  Yeah, one -- one year I did Tai Bo actually.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And it was really tiring, but I act- -- I got, like, I don't know, I worked up my endurance and stuff, but I don't really think it helps that much.  I'm not sure what you're supposed to get out of it, 'cause I only did it for, like, a year --
L:  [NOISE] Tai Bo?
R:  But --
L:  Well, you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- should feel stronger, you know, and your muscles should feel tighter, that kind of --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- stuff.  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, do you play any sports?
R:  Ye- -- I used to play field hockey.
L:  [NOISE] Used to play field hockey, [NOISE] oh, so that's [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- good exercise. 
R:  Yeah, well, I quit because I didn't really like the -- the players --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on my team, so ...
L:  You didn't what?
R:  I didn't like the players on my team.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  I didn't get along with them a lot.  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, um, in general, the sport's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fun.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if I can keep doing it for the rest of my life or anything. 
L:  [NOISE] Well, my daughter's, like, a really big tennis [NOISE] player, and I wish -- I had lessons when I was younger [NOISE] and, I mean, he's retired now and he [NOISE] plays with people that are, like, thirty years younger than [NOISE] him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and keeps up with them. [NOISE]
R:  Wow.
L:  But I wish, like, I could play tennis or I was into some kind of sport.  I wanna take tennis lessons [NOISE] because I think that's, like, one of the best ways to exercise, is to be --
R:  Yeah, I wanna --
L:  -- into a sport.
R:  -- learn tennis, too.
L:  That's why I like -- I liked hiking in Runyon Canyon because it felt like a sport.  It was so much fun.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, actually, yeah, my dad likes tennis too, so I wanna play with him, but I have to learn it. 
L:  What, he plays tennis, your dad?
R:  Yeah, not -- not very well.  But he -- he plays it.  So ...
L:  Well, being out in California, do you surf?
R:  No, I actually just came here.  I'm from Maryland. 
L:  Mhm.  You should --
R:  And I just came here for school.
L:  -- try surfing. [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I want to.
L:  Do they have surfing --
R:  Everybody I know --
L:  -- class- --
R:  -- like --
L:  What kind of -- they must have some cool exercise classes at your college?
R:  Not really. 
L:  [NOISE] No?
R:  I -- I looked at our gym, looked -- I looked at their list of classes and they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't really have that much.  I mean, the interesting ones, like --
L:  But I mean --
R:  -- maybe like --
L:  -- like, classes you could take for credit. 
R:  Oh, you mean like gym classes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm, I don't know.  Like, I --
L:  If I was you --
R:  -- don't think they --
L:  -- I would --
R:  -- have surfing.
L:  -- totally get on that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause --
R:  Good idea.
L:  -- um, even it -- it's like a good extra credit, like, if you have to take a fifteen credit load, and, um, it's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wish I would have taken more in college. [NOISE]
R:  True, I should take advantage of it, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Totally.
R:  My friend takes swimming at the school.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I would love that.  I used to be on the swim team.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It was like a swim club in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- high school and we used to swim, and I didn't realise this, at the time I used to eat before -- I'd come home after school starving at, like, three o'clock, so I'd eat and I'd go swimming and I'd be in such pain, so I'd have to stop.  But it was because I ate.  If I didn't eat and I just swam I would have been fine. 
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I don't know.  Swimming's so tiring for me right now, 'cause I'm so out of shape. 
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
R:  But I'll get back in it.  Don't worry. [LAUGH] 
L:  You gotta just take it slow. [NOISE] 
R:  Definitely --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah.
L:  But I like swimming, I really do. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [MN] If it was -- if I could swim and not have dry hair, I would do it every day.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, can't you wear those, like, cap things?
L:  I do, but it -- they -- it doesn't matter, your hair still gets dry.  And ultra swim is not, like, the best.  [MN]
R:  Mm.
L:  I have -- I have -- like, I'm -- I'm not obsessed, but I like my hair, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Huh?
L:  I like --
R:  I can't hear you.
L:  -- I have, like, red curly, curly hair and, like, I can't -- like, if I +swam every day it would, like, [inaudible] I don't know, it would, like, dry up and fall out. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] And plus, it's not good for it. [NOISE]
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] And it dries out your skin and [SIGH] --
