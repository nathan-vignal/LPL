L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi, my name's Annette.
L:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
R:  [NOISE] I've never done this, this is weird.
L:  Me either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I guess we're supposed to talk about health and fitness, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you exercise?
L:  Well, off and on, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- lately I've been sort of exercising. [LAUGH]
R:  I exercise -- exercise, excuse me, chasing my kids and that's about it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Well, that sounds like a real workout.
R:  I keep saying I'm gonna start yoga or something like that but I just haven't yet.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  No get up and go, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's hard to, like, get in the habit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of it.  That's the trickiest thing for me, like, once I get -- once I get going then it works --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a little while and then I get thrown off, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I think once I could get [NOISE] into a routine I -- you know, I'd be okay it's just getting to that point. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um, well I think it's, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well it's something I definitely wanna do.
R:  Yeah, yeah [NOISE].
L:  You know, it's not, like, " [MN] I don't wanna do that" you know, um [LAUGH] --
R:  So, what kinda stuff have you done?
L:  Well, um, through my employer I get this, like, uh, gym membership kind of thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so other than walking -- you know, I walk to work and I also do just, you know, recrea- recreational walking, et cetera.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I do this, uh, elliptical machine.  For some reason that is not as boring as the other aerobic exercises.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, I do that and then I like swimming, you know.
R:  Oh, I love swimming.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Now, it's finally getting nice out here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Are you here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are you in the Philadelphia area?
R:  Nope, I'm in Northern Minnesota.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I'm from Minnesota --
R:  Are you?
L:  -- uh, maybe that's why they put us together, I don't know.  I'm originally from Minnesota.
R:  Where abouts?
L:  Minnetonka.
R:  Well, I grew up in, like, the New Brighton area.
L:  Oh yeah, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That, like -- when I was growing up that was like the other side of the world or something [LAUGH]. 
R:  Yeah, well my -- my husband was from, um, like the Burnsville area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He always described it as, "Oh, you're from the other side of the river" [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He brought me out there the day we met and like, "Man, this guy's taking me to the middle of nowhere and --"
L:  I know.
R:  "-- and he's gonna ditch me". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I had no clue where I was. [LAUGH]
L:  It's so funny to think about it, yeah.  So, but you're -- yous -- you're still in Minnesota, you grew up there and ...?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] Well, it's certainly beautiful there but I'm in Philadelphia now so that's how I found about this study because [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of the university --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- here and --
R:  -- I found it online somewhere and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of people were making some pretty decent money and, like, "You know, heck, I can talk on the phone for ten minutes". 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know and I guess they analyze it for I don't know what. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, who knows.  I don't care. [LAUGH]
L:  Accents or something.  I wonder -- I -- I don't know if we're supposed to keep talking about the exercise or just kinda let it happen, like, talk about --
R:  I have no -- 
L:  -- whatever.
R:  I have no idea.  I guess they want you to kinda stay on topic but --
L:  Mhm.  Maybe talk about the exercise terms or something --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- like that.  I don't know.  But, um, yeah, so, [MN] um -- yeah, it's -- it's, like -- it's a little different here with the exercising because it seems like in Minnesota people just do a lot of sport so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're -- or, you know, just --
R:  Well, we -- we live in -- I live up in Northern Minnesota where our winters last forever so --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know, it's kind of -- now with winter at least you can get out of the house and, you know, at least when you're walking around you can get some exercise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then once summer comes, you know, you feel a bit more open with biking and stuff but then, you know, [NOISE] we live off a dirt road and [NOISE] --
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  -- so I'm hoping to get a bike 'cause one of the main roads is a nice, you know, black top and it's, you know, there's very little, you know, traffic on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'm thinking, you know, with the five kids it might, you know, still be an okay area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, 'cause there aren't any cars.  So, I'm hoping to pick up a bike 'cause I used to ride a bike a lot back when I was in high school.  I mean, I got some pretty nice legs, you know, from -- you know, mus- muscle wise, not that [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not that I'm saying that, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, why not?
R:  But then -- but then, you know, after having kids I lost weight that I didn't have to lose so that I lose all my muscle.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, if I do it I could get that back.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'm hoping to get a bike.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Oh yeah, that's good exercise.  And I could use a bike around here because parking and everything is such a hassle.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I live --
L:  You know, I gi- --
R:  -- in the country so it's --
L:  Parking's always available, I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I don't know [NOISE].
R:  And it -- you know, and to, you know, drive to town or ride your bike to town --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well I'm looking at twenty five miles so it's -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you need a car out there, for sure.
R:  Yeah, you need a car.
L:  Yeah, but, um -- yeah, and then, you know, the- are there like gyms and stuff --
R:  Yeah, but then again --
L:  -- nearby?
R:  -- it's, you know, twenty five miles --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and wi- I have five kids and my husband's a truck driver so it's --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  You know, I really don't have the time, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do that.  That's why I was hoping like a bike or if I could get into, you know, yoga or some type of an aerobics I could do at home then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  In the summer we get lots of exercise just with the stuff we do outside but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like I said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- our winters are so long that I need something to do inside too.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE] I just don't do any sport so I just have to do that [NOISE] the boring stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I tried a -- have gotten a stair stepper and a stationary bike and that's just too boring, even right in front of the TV --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Yeah.  At least going to the gym you're talking to people, you've got the motivations and you have the person next to you watching ya. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah that -- that keeps you going actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially, like, someone -- some young student type person --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is on there and, like, "I'm gonna --" I can't quit before her, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, yeah, for some reason this elliptic -- maybe it's just 'cause I just started using it, this elliptical machine just isn't quite as boring.  I think because you really use your -- your arms and your upper body and -- and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, it's a little less boring but I'm sure, you know, I'll get tired of that too but at least then I can -- I'll just switch to something else I suppose.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Do they have classes, like, [NOISE] community classes were you could learn yoga or anything [NOISE] like that that?
R:  Not that I've seen.  Not so much here it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, like I'm a vegetarian and that's just -- you know, people think that's just so weird and stuff like yoga and stuff like that -- that -- I mean, that's just out there [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well that's -- I guess that must be a challenge to get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know -- I me- I assume you ea- eat dairy and stuff like that.
R:  Nope, nope, nope, we're to the extreme, we're vegan.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, how do you manage to get, um, get [NOISE] all the stuff you need?
R:  Well, for one you really don't need as much as they claim.  They kinda put the amounts higher [NOISE] just to try to get people, you know, to push harder --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, to get what they need.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then the stuff, like, [NOISE] calcium and stuff like that, you know, [NOISE] that's pretty much in everything you eat unless you're gonna be pigging out on candy and we don't eat sugar and that kind of stuff so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we're not like junk food vegetarians which is pretty common with a lot of people.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  So, it's just not something I worry about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And then, you know, I've got five kids and they're perfectly healthy and they have been since we switched our, you know, eating.  No ear infections none of that stuff that, you know, most kids -- people think it's just the com- common, "Oh it's just the kids, everyone gets ear infections".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I say, "You know, no they don't or they shouldn't". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's interesting 'cause it just seems like that would be a real challenge not to have, you know, any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cheese or anything with kids.
R:  It kinda was at first but it's something that you need -- you have to really want to do it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's -- you know, 'cause everything -- you know, everything has milk in it, you have to check all the ingredients and then, you know, as far eating out, well, you really don't eat out unless you -- you don't mind just having a salad. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause at least, you know, where we are there's -- aren't, you know, vegetarian restaurants or even vegetarian options --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- unless we want the salad bar [NOISE] and that's -- you know, that's gonna be it.
L:  Yeah.  Wow!
R:  But, you know, I've done it for almost nine years and I would never go back.
L:  Well, congratulations.
R:  Well, thank you.
L:  I just don't know if I could do that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- I mean, I -- I don't eat a lot of meat just because I don't -- well, sometimes beef kinda scares me.  I don't know if it's fresh or whatever [LAUGH] you know, I'm a little worried --
R:  Oh yeah, with all the things --
L:  -- about that.
R:  -- that you hear about lately, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um, but, yeah, I like fish and I'll eat chicken [NOISE] but I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I don't eat it that often, maybe once a week or something [NOISE] like that.
R:  Well, you're probably even healthier than you actually really even thought. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, maybe. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I also eat -- I also eat a lot of junk that's true.  That's one reason why I wish I would exercise more.  I kinda feel like, "Well, if I exercise more then I can not be -- you know, not worry so much about my diet".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I suppose I better get the big picture.
R:  Well, are you trying to, like, lose weight or just stay fit?
L:  Uh, [MN] just stay fit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I'd like to lose a little weight, you know, just because y- you know, like getting -- like, I'm in my thirties and I'm [NOISE] -- I don't know my metabolism is slowing down or --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- my lifestyle change or something but I'm a little bigger than I'm used to.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm thinking, "Well, I better ..." you know.  And I tried that, uh, Weight Watchers program which was pretty effective and reasonable but I just -- still the whole idea of, like, I have to keep track of every single thing I eat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you know.
R:  Yeah, my girlfriend just started that.  We went camping with her this weekend so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- my husband was giving her a hard time, "Well, how many points is that beer?  Well, how many points is that?"  And it's like, "Oh, I'm not doing it this weekend --"
L:  Oh, well --
R:  "-- I'm so over my points". [LAUGH]
L:  Oh well, yeah, that -- that's the thing, like, when -- yeah, when you're with friends or in a spec- like travelling, [NOISE] it's a real challenge [LAUGH].
R:  And -- and that's how any diet is where --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- you know, like, with -- with the way we eat, my husband was a truck driver when we first changed our diet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and within three months he had lost ...
