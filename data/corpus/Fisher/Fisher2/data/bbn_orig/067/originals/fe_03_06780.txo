R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi, I'm Linda.
R:  Hi, Linda, I'm Lori.
L:  Hi, Lori.  Um, well, I guess you want to -- you want to start?
R:  Sure.  Um, nine eleven has changed my life drastically.
L:  Okay.
R:  I mean, um, there's not a day that goes by that I don't think of it.  I don't take life for granted anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, um, I care more about my family now than ever. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  More about being home. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  As opposed to work and other things.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, it's just a day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'll never forget.  Plus on top of it, it was my grandmother's birthday on that day.
L:  Was it really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Yes, well, I -- I guess it's changed my life in that sense too that, um, I just realize how short life is and how pressured it is and how quickly it can, you know, just be taken from you.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So, um, yeah, just, you know, me and my mom and my family we made a pact that every time we talk to each other we'd make sure we tell 'em that we love 'em, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And just appreciating people while they're here and doing things, um, you know, for the ones that you love.  So --
R:  Yup.
L:  [NOISE] -- that's how it's changed --
R:  I couldn't wait to get home from work that day. [LAUGH]  I was praying to God --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, that I would make it home [LAUGH] from work that day.
L:  Right, just to be able to see and touch, you know?
R:  Absolutely.  And I couldn't wait for my -- my son was already home with my --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mom, but my hu- -- my daughter was in school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...  But it is scary.
L:  Right --
R:  Like you said --
L:  -- it really is.
R:  -- you can't take anything for granted.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Life --
L:  Yup, it --
R:  -- is short.
L:  That's for sure.  And it will -- like you say, you know, that was your grandmother's birthday --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's like one of those days like, um, I mean, I was -- can't remember, like, when, you know, John F Kennedy was killed or Martin Luther King Junior, but one of those --
R:  Right.
L:  -- moments where in life you remember exactly where you were, what you were doing.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know what I mean?  It just forever impacts your life, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] And all the stories that were on Oprah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all the talk shows.  And I'll never forget the one woman, I think she was burned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like eighty percent of her body.
L:  Mm, mhm.
R:  And how many plastic surgeries and everything that she had to have.
L:  Right.
R:  And how she felt like her life was just completely taken from her and how she couldn't even hold her son --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for months and months and months.
L:  Mhm.  And I'm telling you, because I --
R:  What a tragedy.
L:  [MN] It really was.  And I work for a place, um, where I deal directly with money --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, um, we have all these evacuation procedures, you know, at work, but none for us because we work directly with the money.  I said, "Look, let a siren or anything go off and I see this building being evacuated --"
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  "-- this money will be right in here and I'll be outside with everyone else" you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But they -- they don't give -- they never really have given us a evacuation [NOISE] procedure, but everyone else in the building has one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  And being in high alert, it's just, um, [NOISE] it's just unsettling, you know?  It's just a real unsettling time.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Because it --
R:  And even what's going on with this day and age with this world, I mean, you never know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You gotta always worry about terrorists.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You gotta worry about flying now.  I mean, things that, you know, we were just taking for granted that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything was safe.
L:  Right.
R:  That we lived in a safe world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But now ...
L:  And I really feel sorry for the children.  I mean, I have two but they're older.  But, you know, for folks that have to ex- -- try to explain or put some --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, [SIGH] some type of understanding and reasoning for -- for the little kids is really -- you know, is really hard to make sense out of all of -- all of this.  And, um --
R:  It is.
L:  -- I just, you know, just really feel for them and the ones that, um, you know, lost their parents and --
R:  I know.
L:  Wow.  You know?
R:  That's what I kept on thinking.  All those children --
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  -- that had to come home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to no parents.
L:  And -- right.  And such -- and you know what was really hard?  To see the people just jumping out of the window.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I mean, that was just -- it was just really terrible.  I mean, it was --
R:  Terrifying, it's absolutely too close to home.
L:  It really was, you know.  But, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you in Philadelphia?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so we were really blessed, you know --
R:  Right, well --
L:  -- that it just went --
R:  -- I live right outside of Philadelphia now, but I'm born and raised in Philadelphia --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I work in Philadelphia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm not far from the Liberty building so it was very scary.
L:  Right, you know.  And then the flip side is I try not [SIGH] -- you know, I work with money and I work with the public and I -- we get a lot of people from all different races and I try to remain open but, you know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- it's like things that you never really paid attention to.  You see someone that, you know, is, um, of that descent or whatever and you --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- you -- you know, you kind of --
R:  I think the same thing when I --
L:  -- like a longer look at them.  
R:  -- look around on the train.
L:  Why's this person going -- you know?  And -- and they probably been here for years and working and citizens and everything just like we are, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it just, you know, makes you stop and think.  And then with the, um, other situation with SARS and stuff it's just ...
R:  I know, you don't even know who you can trust nowadays.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The Gods honest truth.
L:  Right, yep, that's just --
R:  And every day is a blessing because --
L:  It really is.
R:  -- there's no guarantees --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with everything going on in this world.
L:  Right, it really is.  But, ah, I just, um, [NOISE] you know. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  I know.  And years ago, like, you never even thought twice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about any of this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.
L:  I'm telling you.
R:  And I haven't flown since.  I'm abso- --
L:  And -- you haven't?
R:  -- I'm -- I'm -- no.
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm petrified to fly.
L:  Right.  And, well, I -- I've always been, but now [LAUGH] it'll be so more than --
R:  I have no --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- desire to go anywhere.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  I have no desire --
L:  And --
R:  -- to leave.  
L:  And that's what happened for a long time.  Folks were just not traveling, going anywhere, really staying put and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  You -- you wanted to be close to your loved ones.  You want -- you didn't -- you know, like you say, you don't want to go anywhere.
R:  Absolutely.  And it's a shame because, you know, my brother in law works for the airlines.  It's a shame.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They have gotten cuts in pay.  I mean, it's a shame for everybody, you know, like --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- every industry --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- has been affected by this.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know, insurance companies, there's so many claims.
L:  Mm.
R:  Horrible.
L:  That's right.  And then everybody else's, you know, [LAUGH] goes up a little bit, you know?
R:  Right.  Everybody is being penalized --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- for this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's horrible.
L:  Right and that's -- that -- it really is.  And the thing is is that, um, is that I worry about that, that's, you know, it's like -- it's just kind of like inevitable that something like that is going to happen again.  You know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  And that -- and that's -- that's the unsettling fact that, you know, if that could happen like that, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we -- we -- if -- if, you know, it's going to happen again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To what extent and where, you know, remains to be seen.  But I guess, you know, like you just can't just let it really grip you that you can't do anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I think the country --
R:  But you can't let your guard down either. [LAUGH]
L:  -- was in such a state of shock, you know what I mean?  'Cause, ah, a lot of folk didn't come to work the next day, you just --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- you know, you just didn't want to move.
R:  Right, it's the truth.
L:  But, um, [NOISE] you know, but you --
R:  You can never let --
L:  -- got to get up and --
R:  -- your guard down.
L:  Right, that's right.
R:  You know?
L:  That's -- 
R:  And even like --
L:  -- that's the thing.
R:  -- when I go to Atlantic City or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, places are not that far, I'm still always looking around, I'm always worried.
L:  Right.
R:  And crowds.
L:  I know.  And we always -- we like to go to DisneyWorld.  Like every other year we've been.  We went in, um, two thousand but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, they say that that could be [NOISE] one of -- a -- a site that, you know, that they would target and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, kind of takes [LAUGH] the thrill away of wanting, you know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- kind of wanting to go.
R:  I know.  My kids are dying to go there, but like I said, I have no desire right now to fly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm still petrified.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And especially, you know, with the war that just happened.  You know.
L:  Right, I'm telling you.
R:  Just too many things.
L:  I'm telling you so, you know, still -- still dealing with, [SIGH] you know [PAUSE] -- you know, a lot of things that -- that happened, you know.  The aftershocks I guess I'll say.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, the war and stuff.  And so even with the war, if there were going to be some more aftershocks from, you know, from the results of the war.
R:  Yup.
L:  You know, I mean, they saturated the TV with nine eleven and saturated with so much, and now you don't hear anything.  And it's just like, [NOISE] "Okay, what's next?"
R:  You're right.  And God knows how many terrorists are already in this country.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know?
L:  That's right, you know?  And, um --
R:  It could be your next door neighbor.
L:  Yep.
R:  They -- they just blend in with the --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- regular citizens.  That's the scary part.
L:  Yep.  That's the --
R:  They're doctors or lawyer, [LAUGH] you know what I mean?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  And, you know -- and because they -- I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they were trained.  They were -- they had money, they had [NOISE] you know?  They had to have everything, all type of ID's, you know, and ...
R:  Right.  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, they had cash and that's -- that's the unfortunate thing.  In this country if you've got cash you can get just about anything done.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  And that's horrible in a way.
L:  And legal and illegal, you know?
R:  And I think the United States really has to start cracking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- down on who they let into this country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I think that's the number one problem.
L:  I think so too.
R:  You know? [NOISE]
L:  I think so too.  I mean, there are so many other, you know, issues that, you know, we have to deal with ourselves, but ... [SIGH]
R:  Absolutely.  And I feel like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we have to help our own people. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Let alone all the foreigners that they let into this country.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  They seek -- uh-huh -- they 
R:  And look what -- what happened because of that.
L:  That's right.  But so many other things are done in those, um -- those talks that they have and after they go and do what they do it's like you have to make some type of amends or you -- you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  You allow for me to come over and -- and -- and -- hm.
R:  I know.  I know.  And then they don't have to pay taxes for like the first seven years.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- like when you think of it [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's really not fair. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know that we're supposed to be the
