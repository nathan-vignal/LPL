L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi, I'm Sandra.
L:  Sandra. [SIGH] How are you? [SIGH] 
R:  I'm okay, how are you?
L:  Fine thanks. [NOISE] 
R:  This is the second time I've had one of these calls. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay, this is actually my third. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] Um --
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I live in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
L:  Okay. [SIGH] I'm in Massachusetts. [SIGH] 
R:  Okay.
L:  Boston. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] So --
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about exercise?
L:  Yeah.  So, do you exercise regularly?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I do exercise.  I go to a rower team, like, once a week, but I do do other stuff that's physical during the week, [MN] but the only s- time set aside for it [LAUGH] is on Sunday. [LAUGH] 
L:  And -- and what do you do?
R:  [SIGH] Combination of some strain training and martial arts.
L:  Oh. [SIGH] [MN] I used to do --exercise a lot and, um, [SIGH] I'm in graduate school now and I try to fit in some time [SIGH] to [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- exercise so I can at least, you know, release some stress.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, um, [SIGH] I definitely don't do it as much as I used to.
R:  Oh, me neither, and this is basically an hour, 'cause I'm in school, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I mean, I really, really try to do stuff.  Um, today, for example, I went to an aerobics class, but I think I only go once a week and it's a [SIGH] -- a -- but it's more of a conditioning [SIGH] class.  So we do a lot of drills and push ups and sit ups and [SIGH] -- and different strength things.  I mean, it's a really good complete body work out, but [MN] I only do it once a week. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm, well, mine is only once a week.  It's about an hour that I put myself through. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I do actually -- I, um -- I mean, I've always done lots of sports growing up and that's -- um, I've been a competitive athlete and, [SIGH] um, I actually trained for a half marathon, so I ran a half marathon a couple of mon-
R:  What?  I don't --
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  No, I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, I r-
R:  I never heard of a half marathon, that's all.
L:  Yeah, well, uh, in a lot of places they have marathons, they have a -- they'll have a marathon and a half marathon, [SIGH] um, and so -- but the training was pretty hard and [SIGH] I had signed up for it about six months before I actually did the m- the -- the race and of course it's -- you have to start training four months in advance and [SIGH] the only thing that would get me out of bed in the morning was the thought that, okay, I have -- I -- it was just [MN] for this race, I have to keep going and [SIGH] then I had to train in January which was [MN] -- really, I mean, I'm sure it's not as cold as Minnesota, but for Boston it was -- you know, we had below zero weather --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and --
R:  Cold. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I think that once [MN] I was done with this maratho- half marathon, [SIGH] I said, "Forget it, I'm going to sleep in in the mornings and [LAUGH] --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- just take it easy".
R:  Was it -- is that -- is it the Boston marathon that has a half one?
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, this was, um, one in Miami in Florida. [SIGH] 
R:  Okay, 'cause I know --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- that there is a Boston marathon, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- supposed to be a big deal.
L:  [SIGH] But, yeah, the Boston marathon, you have to actually, um, [SIGH] qualify for it.  You have to have run a marathon under a certain time for your age group in order to qualify which is pretty -- pretty intense.
R:  Okay.  There's a woman who ran the disabled version of it in a wheelchair who gave a speech at my school recently.  It's always in the back of my mind.
L:  Wow. [SIGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's -- it's pretty -- I've -- I've seen it and, um, I live not too far away from the last, like [SIGH] -- last few, maybe half -- [MN] the last half mile [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when I -- I go to watch the -- those people that are arriving, I'm just like, [SIGH] "They must be so happy". [LAUGH] I mean, it's -- that race is just -- it's a killer.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] Yeah, I never ran a marathon, I used to run track when I was younger but 
L:  Yeah, I wanted to.  I w- I actually wanted to run a marathon, but [SIGH] I was a gymnast and I sort of injured my ankle and I thought it was okay for me to keep doing other sports, but it turns out that I really [SIGH] shouldn't be [MN] putting as much strain on my ankle as, um, that necessary for --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- training for a marathon.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I'm like, "Okay". [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm.
L:  [SIGH] I was --
R:  I think I sprained mine quite a few times running track, also f- and it's easier for me to twist them. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  It's just -- w- what -- what events did you do in track?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, there was I think a three mile and a one mile.  There was one outside in, like, the fall [NOISE] -- field areas for New York City.  Um, and there was another one, [NOISE] they had these short races [NOISE] with passing these ones and then armory.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I always hated those 'cause [SIGH] it was always dusty in there and I always got sick. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I don't know what it was.  I mean, I'm know I'm sort of allergic to stuff, but [NOISE] the thing about the whole experience was I got sick almost every time I went there.  Those are always in the Bronx, it was a trip going up there.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  When I h- in my last job I used to [MN] get in more exercise just from working [LAUGH] and I [MN] don't as much now that I live here. 
L:  S- so, you s-
R:  So --
L:  -- you would get exercise j- in -- as part of your job?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what was that?
R:  [NOISE] I was the dairy person in a grocery store, so I was --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- walking --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- standing all day, throwing stuff around. [SIGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  The only woman they let in there. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] they always used just guys. [SIGH] It took them a long time to let me stock there, even though it was California, they had [NOISE] their heads and still needed [NOISE] [SIGH] um --
L:  What did -- didn't let woman work 'cause it was too labor intensive, or ?
R:  Yeah, because [NOISE] one industry that's behind the times.
L:  [LAUGH] I didn't know that.
R:  They also tried to regulate which bathroom I piss in.
L:  Hm.
R:  I mean, there I did some nasty stuff. [LIPSMACK] Oh, this is being recorded and I just said that.  Oh, well.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it's true. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It wasn't till the poultry worker case, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] um, where they let poultry workers win the right to go to the bathroom that they stopped harassing us too.  But I got a serious workout [LAUGH] on a daily basis [LAUGH] there [SIGH] and now that I've moved here to go to school, I weigh about ten pounds more. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] So, you're in school right now?
R:  Yeah.  Prothotics[?] and prosthetics.
L:  Okay.
R:  What program is yours?
L:  Uh, psychology.  Actually, I -- I do s- interesting, really, I do speech perception [SIGH] so I -- I, um -- I know exactly what this study -- that these recordings are for. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well this is good because I have no idea exactly what they're looking for, I haven't -- [LAUGH] they're trying to figure out do people misunderstand each other, or whether --
L:  No, it's basically I think that they're trying to get, um -- [SIGH] what happens [MN] when you study speech perception, you know, [MN] you record, um, speakers, you know, whatever you're looking at, but it's really under idealized conditions --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and you have people come in and you have -- present them words or sentences or whatever and they're always recording, [SIGH] but it's really not spontaneous speech [SIGH] and I think that what they're trying to get here is [SIGH] more of the spontaneous speech, more of, um [SIGH] -- um, like, y- you know, a- all different types of topics and conversations across -- [SIGH] um, I'm also doing across different genders or different accents, regional accents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and try- trying to get a -- a data base, a nice corpus to examine, um, what's -- or what speech in a -- in a natural way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So--
R:  I'm starting to wonder if they're pairing people with the same educational [inaudible] too.
L:  [SIGH] Um, let's see [MN] --
R:  'Cause they seem to be.
L:  -- uh, all -- all -- well, everyone that talked with has been a student.
R:  Same with me, or maybe that's 'cause we're all broke.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's, "Oh, yeah, I'll sign up for this thing".  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know, I, um -- I always -- I'm always going for these little studies, and actually -- I mean, I -- I know we're getting off the topic, [LAUGH] but [SIGH] the other day, uh, I sent off for a focus group and I got this call to participate in a focus group for two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hours --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] tasting cookies for two hundred dollars. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  But unfortunately I couldn't because it was when I was going to be teaching a class. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Well, I know that there's some medical trial in Wisconsin for six hundred dollars but, [SIGH] you know, you can't figure out from their recording what drug they're going to make --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you swallow. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, oh, here in Boston we have tons -- there's another one, um, at this, um, hospital, um, it's a sleep study, sleep --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- deprivation study.
R:  Wow.
L:  [SIGH] But it's, like, seven days, um, with a, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know -- it's not like you're in sleep def- department all the time, but you go through different tests and there's -- and at the very last [SIGH] -- the last two days you -- something like you're awake for thirty six hours --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a, um, up stand position [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and then you -- uh, and they keep you -- they give you all these cognitive tasks and then you -- at the -- at the end you get, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- one thousand five hundred dollars. [SIGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  I don't think that would be enough for me f- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- for seven days of torture. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Well, those other studies, it's six hundred dollars for three days, but it doesn't tell you what drugs they're testing.  I suppose if you actually get through to a live person you might be able to figure that out, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then there's other ones which pay more and have more days but it's just [inaudible] -- it's, like, comments. [MN] 'Cause Wisconsin's within driving distance, 'cause I'm, like, on the border in the twin cities.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Well, we're supposed to talk about exercise, otherwise they might not [NOISE] call me back for my third call, or I'll [NOISE] call them. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No, I think that, you know -- I mean, I think that, um, the way I have read about it is just that they give you topics to talk about just in c- just so that you have something to talk about, but they just --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- really want you to talk, that's the thing.  Because I know my first topic [SIGH] was something, I don't know, politics or -- [SIGH] and th- then we ended up talking about speech the whole time.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know.
R:  [SIGH] The first topic I got was [MN] cameras in the courtroom.
L:  Oh.
