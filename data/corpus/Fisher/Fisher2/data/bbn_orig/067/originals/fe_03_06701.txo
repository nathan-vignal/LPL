L:  [NOISE] Hello, this is Michelle.
R:  [MN] Hi, this is Shara.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
L:  How are you? [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm fine.  This is my first time doing this and I'm not exactly sure [LAUGH] what we're supposed to do. 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, I've done it before, [NOISE] [LAUGH] uh, we just pretty much --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- bullshitted the whole time. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, well, [SIGH] um, health and fitness. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] Um, [MN] [SIGH] let me see.
L:  [NOISE] Do you exercise? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I've tried to.  Um, I'm in a -- I'm a national guard, so [SIGH] [NOISE] when I graduated last march from M.P. school I was, like, in shape, but [SIGH] haven't been doing so much since --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- then. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I, -- I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have my times.  I go through, like, periods where I'll exercise really good, and then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] like, right now I'm not doing so good exercising. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Like, do you go to a gym?
L:  [NOISE] No.  Well, I have, like, when I was in college I did. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I went to a gym between classes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, now I just do -- we have a treadmill in the house and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a weight bench and [SIGH] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah, I --
L:  -- so I just --
R:  -- I --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I just bought myself one of those elliptical machines and I try to do, like, two miles on it every day but it usually works out to, like, once or twice or week.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I [NOISE] -- I try. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I do work out videos sometimes, so 
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] so --
L:  But --
R:  -- do you, like, diet or any -- eat special foods or --
L:  Um --
R:  -- organic?
L:  I eat a lot of fast food. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Me too.  I have McDonalds for lunch.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I'm not going to lie. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um, I try to. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  But [MN] -- convenience, I guess --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm just --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- but, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] [NOISE] I --
R:  If there was one thing that you could change different about, like, how you exercise, what would it be?  Like, [SIGH] would it just be more money and hire a trainer or --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] just more time so you could do it?
L:  I think, [NOISE] yeah, [NOISE] more time.  I would -- I mean, I would love to have a trainer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think, [NOISE] but, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] I think if I had -- I don't even know if it's -- that more time -- [NOISE] I'm just lazy by the end of the [LAUGH] day, after work and everything.
R:  Right, right.
L:  so, if I just [NOISE] had more energy to [NOISE] actually do it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] would be nice.  Baby. [NOISE] But, um [NOISE] -- and you? [LAUGH] 
R:  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I think I'd definitely ask --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for -- for more money --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- just [SIGH] because I think I need that motivation --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like, [SIGH] being in the army when you have, like, a drill sergeant and they're, like yelling at you all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, at the time it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- doesn't feel good, but, like, when --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I graduated, everyone was like, "Oh, my gosh".
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  But I didn't even notice it, and I think that's just what I need, someone to make sure [SIGH] that I'm doing --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- everything because I don't think people [NOISE] push themselves --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- past their [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, see that's -- I tell my husband --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I was like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] "I need somebody --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- [NOISE] you know, to make me do it". [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm obviously not making --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- myself do it. [NOISE] 
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] And I'll --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'll do it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for, like, a week or a month --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or whatever and then I'll --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- give up.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And if I had --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, if I did have a trainer or --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a nutritionist or whatever --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- to talk to and to help me, then, yeah, I would 
R:  Right, [SIGH] 'cause I even think it's just, like, [SIGH] the long term.  I think just, like, short term, like, just exercising, like, just doing more than, like, ten pushups.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] You know, not just stopping 'cause it hurts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I think that's what gets me more than anything else.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, [NOISE] hm, [inaudible].  What else, um [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no. [SIGH] Um, do you --
L:  [SIGH] This is --
R:  -- tae bo?
L:  No, I've tried it.  That sucks.
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You think so?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I don't know -- I think I probably gave up on it too easy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I do, like, exercise videos.  I do, like, that big ball that they have.
R:  Right.
L:  I love that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I love doing those videos.  But I got tae bo, and me and my m- me and my boss were going to start doing it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] but I, like, gave up before, like, the first --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fifteen minutes of it, I was like, "Okay".
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I bought the videos, I just didn't keep, like, doing it every day and I thought it was a buzz, [SIGH] but I just think it's hard to do anything with a video when you're not, like, [SIGH] in the class, you know, you just have this -- the thrill of doing it with other people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [LIPSMACK] -- what about --
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  -- you -- like, yoga, do you do that?
L:  No, and I thought about -- 'cause I'm working at a daycare.
R:  Are you?  Oh, my gosh, are you serious?
L:  Yes.
R:  [SIGH] I'm doing this education direct corresponding course so I can be a, um -- [SIGH] child daycare management.  I want my own daycare so bad.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] It's so cool.
L:  [NOISE] Um, one day, on, like, a talk show, 'cause I was sitting there watching TV while I was watching --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, um, one day on the talk show there was this lady on [NOISE] and she was, like, showing how to do baby yoga, like, [SIGH] yoga with your kids.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm in the baby room --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I need that so that I can sit at work and, [SIGH] you know, do this yoga --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the babies --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, like, the parents would think that was cool, 'cause you're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, they'd know that you were interacting with the kids, like, doing fun stuff like that --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- but I d- I did some of it with her on TV [NOISE] while she was showing the different exercises --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I was like, "That would really be cool" but I can't find the actual videos, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think there's probably a book or something --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but 
R:  Is yoga -- yoga's just stretching, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, but they had like -- I don't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they had -- like, you'd hold the baby above you or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was like bench press type --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- things.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But it was -- it was under, like, baby yoga type --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so -- [LIPSMACK] but it was pretty cool.
R:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] [NOISE] Uh, let me see [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- what about Pilates?
L:  What's that?
R:  Pilates.
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I mean these are just things that, like --
L:  What is that?
R:  -- 'cause I read a lot of [SIGH] entertainment magazines, but it's, like, what, like, all the stars do, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know how you do it in your home, but I know they have, like, this machine, [SIGH] like, you -- that you strap yourself up to, and it, um, -- like, it pulls and it stretches [NOISE] you and it, like, makes you do all these crazy, like, movements.
L:  Really?
R:  Like, I don't know, like, you could put your foot, like, up in a strap, like, w- above your head or something and then, like, you would pull and it's, like, resistance also. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I don't know. [SIGH] [NOISE] I think it's just the new wave of yoga or something --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- like, you're just using something to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- help you do [NOISE] all the movements. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- it's --
L:  I would need that to do yoga. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] I'm, like -- I don't know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I mean, I would love to just so I could be able to say, "Yeah, I do yoga".
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Yeah, every morning, I'm [MN]". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] If I had the time. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but, no, I don't really do anything.  I think my main goal is just to make sure that [SIGH] I'm doing cardiovascular, just so that I can just, like, keep my weight down.  'cause I'm in college now [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it just really sucks to, like, just see [SIGH] [LAUGH] how much bigger I am [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- compared to high school.  Like, I don't know, like, I never worried about what I ate in high school and now, I, like, feel guilty [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- every time I eat something I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, I just had a whole bad of hot cheetos". [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I would, like, [NOISE] you know, eat it and then right afterwards, I'd be like, "Oh, my god, I can't believe I did that". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and I really don't think guys actually think like us.  At the end of the day -- I don't do it all day, but I'll be like, "I wonder how many calories" and I'll try to add up all the calories I had today and see [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if I had too many. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] So, that -- yeah, and then I snack, like -- like, I just eat when I'm hungry. [SIGH] Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I try to have little things, but I'll eat something. [SIGH] so, I'm just trying to make sure, like, [SIGH] I make a tuna sandwich or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead of, like, [SIGH] I don't know, having a hot pocket.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] that's my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- main goal.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, [SIGH] I -- I [LAUGH] -- I was just talking at work today, I was like, "Okay". [SIGH] 'Cause I got -- I ordered, like, a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- chicken light sandwich from --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Bellicenos[?], this place I eat --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] And this girl was like, "Are you trying to lose weight?"  I'm like, "Well, not really, I just like the sandwich".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was like, "I do need to lose weight".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I'm not going to tell everybody, [LIPSMACK] you know, I'm trying to lose weight, but --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I was thinking this past weekend, I think I really need to start running on [NOISE] treadmill again and [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I put it -- I put it in the [NOISE] living room intentionally so that I could watch TV while I was running, but --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's, like, just sitting --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, [SIGH] 'cause, I mean, I have my elliptical machine and --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- like, you can, like, [LIPSMACK] you know, compact it and lean it up against the wall [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but seeing as it's, you know, just troublesome just pulling it down. I don't want to leave it out because it, like, takes away from the look of the living room --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] even though no one comes here and is going to see [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- see it [LAUGH] but it's just I li- d- like, this obsession with how things look [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then [MN] [SIGH] I don't know, I don't know what it is, I just wish I could be like the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there's this one lady in my job and she eats, like, the nastiest food, but they're like the healthy stuff, like, [SIGH] she'll bring in a whole, [MN] you know, can of beans [SIGH] and then, like, she'll stir 'em in with, like, some green beans or some peas [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  -- [SIGH] and then, like, she'll --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have a good yellow rice stuff.  Like, she had this today and I asked her about it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she's, like, really skinny [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- she said her motivation is because she was chubby as a child, [SIGH] and it --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- I mean, [SIGH] it's weird, like, looking at her, you're, like -- you would have never guessed.  Like, she is, like, skinny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, I mean, that's amazing the fact that someone can do something like that by themselves.
L:  Yeah, I know.  See, yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that's the [SIGH] -- I wish I had it in me to do it all by myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's, like, my husband, I'm -- I'm like, "Even if you would do it with me".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was -- like, if we, like, made and hour out of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- each night, or forty five minutes out of each night and just made that exercise time [SIGH] and, you know, we were there to motivate each other --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I was, like, I think that would even help.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  But, I -- [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I can't even do that with -- with my boyfriend because [SIGH] he's like, six six and he's skinny [SIGH] [NOISE] so [LAUGH] I mean --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] he w- doesn't -- I can't, like, cook healthy foods all the time because then I have to make dinner for both of us --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I know he's not going to want to come home and be like, "Um, what else is going with the salad?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, that -- [SIGH] I think that makes it hard on myself too. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
