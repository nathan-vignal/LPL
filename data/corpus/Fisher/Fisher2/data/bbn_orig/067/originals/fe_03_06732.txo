R:  Hello. [SIGH] 
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm fine.
L:  Good.  My name's Kelly.
R:  Hi, I'm Debbie, I'm in New York City. [SIGH]
L:  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, right. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  [SIGH] How's the weather? [NOISE] 
R:  Cold, it's still cold.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, it's chilly tonight.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  I'm originally from New York.
R:  [NOISE] Really, I -- I lived in Atlanta two years ago. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] I -- some place I don't want to ride a bicycle at, I know that. [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I was out in Marietta.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] So, do I exercise regularly?  Absolutely not.
L:  No?
R:  No, not real- well, no, because I'm always walking and up and down the stairs anyway in the subways and stuff, I don't have time. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  You know what?  I don't either --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm a real estate agent --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I'm constantly [NOISE] constantly on the go --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- walking [NOISE] previewing homes [NOISE] and so forth --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so [SIGH] I don't have time.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I used to go to, um, crunch fitness at least --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- four times a week.
R:  [NOISE] Did you?
L:  But it just -- yeah, after a while --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it just gets repetitious --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it -- I get --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to the point where --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't see [NOISE] results quick enough [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] automatically [LAUGH] would stop going.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I saw -- I -- I've  --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- seen a few crunch [NOISE] places here --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they have 'em still. [NOISE] 
L:  Mostly I think they're, what, Valleys in New York?
R:  No they have crunch too --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I see crunch.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] You see them everywhere though --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a [MN] lot of people are fitness oriented here, they're very [NOISE] -- [SIGH] they tend to be pretty health here. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Now, one thing, [NOISE] I do eat healthy, I eat a lot of salads, [NOISE] I drink a lot of water [NOISE] so I am conscious--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as far as what I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- eat, [NOISE] being that I don't exercise --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I try to balance it out --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that way, taking vitamins and so forth. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I think I would exercise, though, if I had more time. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I think it has to be fun.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I was more of a s- a swimmer type or on a bicycle, so I guess it d- that counts as exercise but it's -- it's more necessary [NOISE] [SIGH] or entertaining, the just, uh -- I just -- I'm not the gym type, I just can't go to the gym. 
L:  [SIGH] What about yoga?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Lately I've been --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- seeing a lot of emphasis on yoga [NOISE] techniques and so forth. [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I think for meditation and stuff [NOISE] spiritually, that's probably [NOISE] extremely healthy.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] I don't -- I don't really know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- much about it, though. [NOISE] 
L:  Well, actually I've watched one of the [NOISE] yoga tapes, [NOISE] a lot of the exercises are not as strenuous [NOISE] as regular exercise methods --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, most [NOISE] of 'em are just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pretty much don't even feel like you're --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- exercising I guess because you're also [NOISE] relaxing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the mind [SIGH] as well as relaxing the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- body as well.
R:  You know, and I bet those are the -- probably the best ones too.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [NOISE] You know, not being strenuous on the body.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  I'm a smoker, though, so it would be hard for me anyways, my bo- you know, my lungs [NOISE] crap out before my body does. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And that's not a good thing to do any more [NOISE] up here, [NOISE] this is -- [SIGH] actually anywhere, but it's b- really bad up here now.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, you can't smoke in --
L:  You say [NOISE] it's cold?
R:  [SIGH] Huh?
L:  You said the weather is cold?
R:  Yeah, we had -- it rained.  It was cold all weekend, it was -- [NOISE] and then tonight I was cold coming in and I was wearing a jacket. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  And it's just -- it's, like, in low fifties at night. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Y- well, actually it's been like that here in Atlanta --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- 'cause I haven't even --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ran my A.C. --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at all, and at night --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- sometimes I have to even close the windows --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so it has been [SIGH] -- the weather's been really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- strange.
R:  [NOISE] I remember it being bitter in Atlanta.  I was there in -- in the year two thousand --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that winter [NOISE] and I froze my butt off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I really did.  It was cold. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] And that's --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- all I can say, "You're from New York and you're [NOISE] cold?"  I say, "Yeah, I never got used [NOISE] to the snow there --"
R:  No, I just --
L:  "-- and I'm not going to get --"
R:  -- I just came back up --
L:  "-- used to the cold here".
R:  -- from Florida in February, I moved back after ten years of being gone. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] And Florida's nice.
R:  [MN] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  No cold weather --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- only at night when you're near the water.
R:  [NOISE] Oh they're dying now, they're begging for it now [NOISE] it's [NOISE] so hot. 
L:  Yeah, it is, it's too hot, it's like a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- s- humid hot where you almost [SIGH] [NOISE] can't breathe type of hot.
R:  [NOISE] Which I don't mind if I can swim. [NOISE] Which I really don't mind it. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Now --
R:  I [NOISE] --
L:  -- swimming [NOISE] is good exercise.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I work next door to a gym, it's [NOISE] New York Health and Racket Club. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] But it's for -- you know, it's got to be r- [NOISE] it's got to be expensive [NOISE] 'cause it's got, like, the big pools [NOISE] and [SIGH] racket ball and all that stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And you don't see any -- any -- [NOISE] [SIGH] everybody that goes in there's fit. [LAUGH] [NOISE] they look fit. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] My whole thing, if you're going to go --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to the gym, [NOISE] the best thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is to have a -- a personal trainer --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you're trying to [SIGH] -- because if you don't have somebody who's just going constantly --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- push there, you're going to go in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- there, do the same exercises --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and as soon as you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- feel like you're tired, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Okay, I'm not going to do any more". [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, have you had a personal trainer? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Um, I had one --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- last year and [NOISE] he was really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- good, 'cause he trained --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of athletes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he was real good, 'cause I'm like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Look, I can't do any more". 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "Yeah, you can --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- [SIGH] give me a few more" --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he was just [NOISE] -- keep on --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pushing me and would not let me --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- stop, but the thing about it is, [SIGH] um, once I would --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- leave the gym, I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- would have a lot of energy as well as --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- once I would [NOISE] finish working out with him [NOISE] I wouldn't leave the gym--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I would go on my own and just work on some of the [NOISE] equipment --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that I w- had already been working on. [NOISE] 
R:  I tried running, I was running last summer.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Just in the mornings, [NOISE] I was getting up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about, like, you know I was going out, like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- between four thirty and five --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- every morning --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- before dawn --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] and I felt really good though after I ran. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] You know, I ended up getting a second and third wind after the pain subsided some, it was -- it really -- it started -- I started feeling really good though --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I guess there is [NOISE] some truth in it of [MN] [NOISE] you know, that -- there having the good effects. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I know I really -- if I didn't have somebody with me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they would -- they really had -- it was -- would have been embarrassing if I d- [SIGH] if I stopped, you know, [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  While it was really, really painful [NOISE] and I just kept pushing and [NOISE] pushing and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] but I -- I did try it for one summer, but I don't think I could do that again. [NOISE] 
L:  Are you located -- do you work close to Central Park where you could do --
R:  I live really close, I --
L:  -- like, a walk at lunchtime or something? [NOISE] 
R:  I live really close to Central Park --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm in between Central Park and, um, Riverside Park. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [MN] I'm half a block from Riverside Park. [NOISE] 
L:  So you're on the west side?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, right on Seventy Ninth Street, right in by the boat basin there. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's nice over here. [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I grew up in, uh, Mount Vernon.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And my mum grew up in New Rochelle.
R:  I know Mount Vernon, it's beautiful there.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, so I [NOISE] -- I try to [NOISE] visit New York at least once a year.  Actually, I'll probably be there [NOISE] -- I usually try to come in, like, [NOISE] July where I can really enjoy myself.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  For the festivities. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And even though I -- I usually try to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- come for about a week and usually a week -- [MN] I tell anybody, a week is just not long enough to see --
R:  I tell you I was --
L:  -- New York how you want to see [LAUGH] it.
R:  Uh-uh, and I'm just thinking of leaving.  I was even thinking of going back to Atlanta because the economy was so good for me there, I had no problems finding good jobs.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And here it's really tough now. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yeah, and the mayor just laid off, like, three thousand people last month and he -- they just -- then they laid off, like, another fifteen hundred to two thousand [NOISE] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- recently, so -- and it's tough.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I actually just found a house for a lady that worked in at -- at the World Trade Centre.
R:  [NOISE] Ooh. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, so, um, she lost her job after that and of course --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] a few months later she found out that she was pregnant.  She said with the mental stress and everything she just decided --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, she would wait a while [NOISE] before she --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- went back to work. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  I don't blame her. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Well, she went to the right place --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- because the econ- economy is excellent down there.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  It really is, I really, really enjoyed living down there.  I started out in Avondale in Dakata[?] for just --
L:  Avondale Estates?
R:  -- about a month.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, it's nice there. It kind of reminds you of like, uh, Westchester or White plains --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- part of New York, yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  I had a cousin that was a -- managed one of the apartments over there, so I was there for a while.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  And then we moved over to Smart- [NOISE] like, to Smarter and Marietta.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] And it was nice --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [MN] off of [NOISE] Cob Parkway.
L:  [SIGH] It's too congested over there.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but it is -- it was -- it was good for me.  I didn't have to -- at least I didn't have to get on the highway. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] And then I road my bike, I road my bike to work, so that was [NOISE] -- uh, you know, but the hills were tough. [NOISE] 
L:  So, you also worked and lived in Marietta?
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, I wasn't driving at the time, [NOISE] I didn't have my license back then, so [NOISE] I didn't have a choice but to ride a bike and walk. [LAUGH] 
L:  Where did you work when you were in Marietta?
R:  [NOISE] At Du Pont [NOISE] in Kennesaw.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] That was a great --
L:  So you think about moving here, moving back?
R:  [NOISE] I'm thinking about it, if -- if something doesn't give up here pretty soon, 'cause I'm -- now I'm just working as an artist but it's freelance. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ... [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I have a girlfriend --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, [NOISE] she works for the -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, Department of Corrections, I say "Well, at least you don't have -- you know you'll always have a job".  So --
R:  Yeah, they will too.  I know they would in Florida. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] And actually that's where she s- wanted to try to relocate for because, um, [SIGH] when they were hiring for the feds --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- last year, she was actually going to try to apply because -- I told her --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I said, "Well, go ahead --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- and apply for that because that'll give opportunities [NOISE] to just move to [NOISE] [SIGH] -- you know --"
R:  Mm. [NOISE] 
L:  "-- go different places".
R:  [NOISE] Sure.  Then, plus that's good security, that -- um, that's good security 'cause it's -- it's [inaudible] industry [inaudible]. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  Good -- good -- good to have that on your resume definitely. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, better to be on that end of it [NOISE] anyway. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] That's funny, 'cause I have a -- I have a -- my ex husband's, um, uncle was a [NOISE] correction office in Atlanta. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Uh, I can't remember which one he was at actually, but [NOISE] I don't know if he was Federal or State.  I think it was probably [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, okay. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] probably state, I'm not sure.
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I don't think the state, uh --
R:  [NOISE] [MN] I don't know.
L:  -- like police officers' jobs here --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pay as well --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because, um, she was considering [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- moving here --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I told her she may want to look into another --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- field as far -- 'cause I don't think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the police officers her, or the corrections officers make --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, it's too dangerous anyways.
L:  Yeah, and it's not worth it.
R:  No, [NOISE] no way.
L:  Mm, yeah, so what she does --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is -- it's pretty laid back since some days she's out in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the field, you know, where she has to go visit --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the clients or she had to go do pick ups [NOISE] or transport --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- people [SIGH] but it's not [NOISE] majority of her work, majority of her work is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- either a lot of [NOISE] paperwork --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- follow up [NOISE] calls and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] that's better.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Much safer too, I think.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
R:  Plus you can make more of a di- she can make more of a difference --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- maybe, or [SIGH] [inaudible] you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- if you genuinely care --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, have that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- interest in people.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, what have they done with the World Trace Center, is it just still empty? [NOISE] 
R:  Uh, as far as I know, yeah.  I haven't -- I haven't really brought myself to go down to that.  I was here a year ago [NOISE] you know, back when --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] -- it was closer to when it first happened --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- but I haven't been down there lately -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I know they have -- you know, they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have, like, memorials and stuff.
L:  Yeah, right. [NOISE] 
R:  But they're still -- they still have it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- on -- on a board what they're going to do with it. [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
