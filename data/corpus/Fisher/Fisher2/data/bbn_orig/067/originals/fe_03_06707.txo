R:  Hello.
L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My --
L:  My name's Mary. 
R:  Hi, Mary.  I'm Jim.
L:  [NOISE] So, do you exercise? [NOISE]
R:  Ah, no I don't.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I should.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Yes, I do. 
R:  What -- what do --
L:  Um --
R:  -- you do?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we live in a very small town, and I just -- I came from a big town -- ah, from a big city.  And --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- so, it's more on your own here than it is -- like, any gyms or anything like that. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So, we --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- walk and we bike, but that's about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, some of the neighbourhood folks are walking at six AM here.  W- we live in a suburb --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of Milwaukee and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have --
L:  No, not that early --
R:  -- a bad --
L:  -- we don't do it.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Some -- some of them work.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one or two of 'em does not.  So, I mean it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, I have a bad knee.  So, I think if I walked a couple of miles that early I'd --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably be hurting midday, so I --
L:  Do you think so?
R:  Walking's not a -- not a good option for me.
L:  Oh, I was gonna say, I have a b- -- I have a bad knee, and sometimes it -- it's better if you walk up hills than down.
R:  Is it?
L:  I found out, yeah. [MN]  But, yeah, you can't definitely overdo it.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I've --
L:  But, I'm a lifetime Weight Watcher person, and so --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  -- I got --
R:  Good for you.
L:  -- into it that you can't -- I can't --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- stop.  If --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- if I don't exercise all --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- the time--
R:  Yeah, that's -- you're absolutely right.
L:  Yeah, there you silly dog.  And then we have dogs that we take for walks and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that helps a lot.
R:  Yeah. We lost out dog last year, so we, ah, think if we get a new one he will be taking the dog out too.
L:  Oh, we lost ours Friday.
R:  Oh, you did?
L:  Yeah, one of our dogs -- Friday.
R:  Oh.
L:  Neighbour hit it with the truck.
R:  Oh no.
L:  I know. [MN] 
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  Yeah.  So, we had to put her down.  And she loved to walk, so that was --
R:  Did she?  What kind of dog was it?
L:  It was a lab.
R:  Oh yeah, those are good dogs.
L:  So, now we just have a terrier left and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- a Shih-Tzu.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We kind of collect dogs from people who don't take care of 'em.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- now we have these two that are -- we're gonna be [MN] just alone with these two now.  But, [LIPSMACK] anyway ...
R:  We had a cocker and she was fifteen and she -- she was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- k- -- pretty sickly the last year, so we, ah, didn't -- didn't take her out too much.
L:  Well, Sadie was thirteen, so I guess --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- we didn't have to face that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It just -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- kind of happened.
R:  Excuse me.
L:  And our kids always go biking, so we do that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, we're --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- moving in --
R:  -- I think --
L:  -- a couple of weeks, and they have a gym there.  And so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm hoping to get started on weight lifting, which I've never done.
R:  Yeah, that's good.  I --
L:  [MN]
R:  In the winter I -- I have a treadmill in the basement, and weights, and I have a stationary bicycle, so I do some of that in the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- winter.  In the summer -- I mean, I cut the grass and, ah, it's a big yard, so it's a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- moving around -- raking -- I have a big hill that I have to do -- use a trimmer on, so --
L:  Do you like your treadmill?
R:  Ah, yeah I do.  I -- I just -- the neighbour moved and sold it to me free -- inexpensive[?].  And, ah, you could set it -- I mean, you can set in two minute intervals to fast or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- slow, or raise the incline.
L:  We have a Precor one, and I really like it. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE] But, it's not that complicated.  I mean, you can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do all that stuff. [NOISE]  It's pretty old, so --
R:  Yeah.  Well, this one has -- it has, like, cards.  And if, ah, you could -- moderate and, ah [SIGH] --   
L:  Oh.
R:  -- ah, expert and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- beginner and all that.  And you just -- you just put this card in and it automatically programs, ah, ten or fifteen or twenty minutes -- whatever increments you want.
L:  That would be nice.
R:  Yeah -- yeah, that works out pretty well.  And it -- and then you can -- you can look at your heart rate.  Ah, you -- the thing [inaudible] various things, like speed, like, um, calories, like, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- how far have you walked, watch your heart rate.  You know, I kind of try to get my heart to a certain point. [MN]  And so, you can monitor that 'cause it's on your -- you know, there's a -- a little clip on your finger. [SIGH]  So --
L:  We -- we have a stair stepper too.  And, ah --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Well, we -- I can't do it with my knee -- I can't do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It started out really great, and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I could barely walk up the steps.  Also it kind of makes -- if you use it too much [MN] it kind of makes you butt big.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Know what I mean?
R:  [MN] 
L:  You kind of --
R:  No.
L:  -- start developing all these odd muscles there --
R:  Oh, really?   
L:  -- in -- it -- yeah, it was -- I didn't like it. [LAUGH]  So --
R:  Well, ev- --
L:  But -- 
R:  Every garage sale has a rowing machine.
L:  Oh yeah.  Have --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- you ever tried --
R:  -- think --
L:  -- one? [LAUGH] 
R:  -- anybody ever buys one and uses it.  It always winds up in a garage sale.
L:  I tried it at a gym once.  I didn't like it.
R:  No.
L:  At a hotel gym.  It didn't seem like it did anything --
R:  [MN] I --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- wish we had a pool.  I would love to do that.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, a pool would be nice.  We live, um, on a lake right now.  We'll be moving, but --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- that's not the same.
R:  Yeah.  Wh- --
L:  You know, you really can't do anything.
R:  What part of the country do you live in?
L:  Iowa.
R:  Oh, in Iowa?  Okay.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  From Nebraska.  We moved here five years ago.
R:  Okay.  And where are you gonna move to then?
L:  Iowa. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, Iowa. [LAUGH] 
L:  Just a bigger town in Iowa.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You know, we've been in the news a lot too.  Ah, Larry Eustachy and a whole bunch of other --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- stuff.
R:  -- sure.
L:  But --
R:  That's true -- that's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, we're in --
L:  We're season --
R:  -- Milwaukee -- 
L:  -- ticket holders, so we can't wait to see what goes on.
R:  Oh great.
L:  But, anyway, this is only my second call. And this is a much better topic that last --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- time.
R:  This is my second.  I had video games. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And then they've called a number of times and my -- I forgot to tell my wife.  So, she's just hung up.
L:  [MN]
R:  And, ah, I'm sure that the project's probably upset with me, so --
L:  No.  I turned down calls, ah, for two weeks because we had the Internet on several --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- times and missed them.  And now, they -- I got two calls this week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One was on, ah, televising murder trials.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] Yes or no? [MN]  And now this one.  So, this is much easier.
R:  The one yesterday, which I didn't get to, was, um, on censorship --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which I would've liked to have talked about.  But, um, the video games one was kind of -- I don't know -- I just play 'em on -- play on the computer, whatever.
L:  I've never played one, so I --
R:  Haven't you?
L:  -- wouldn't even be ale to answer that.
R:  Yeah.  Luckily I talked to somebody who played 'em a lot, so he had a Game Cube.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that was fun.
L:  Don't even know what it looks like, and my kids don't have 'em either, so --
R:  Well, that's good.  Don't start. [SIGH]  So -- so, exercise.  Let's see, what other exercise -- I --
L:  I'm making my kids exercise more than I did when I was a kid.
R:  Yeah -- yeah.  I have two college age kids, and they, um -- my daughter does not exerc- exercise very much.  My son is pretty athletic and, ah, he wrestled and was on the rowing team in college, so that's just constant --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- exercising.
L:  And he didn't have a rower at home, huh? [LAUGH] 
R:  No, he didn't.  No.  It -- it -- they lived -- the school was about half a mile from Mississippi River, so every morning at four thirty they --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- were down in the river -- from September to December rowing in a -- in a scull boat.  You know sculling?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So -- and he -- um, he did that until he had to do a lot of travelling.  Ah, they -- and they wanted more money to -- like, they were gonna go up to Harvard and -- and row.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- but, he'd rowed at Iowa and, ah, sort of Minnesota.
L:  Oh, that's -- that's a good workout.
R:  Yeah, it is -- it is.  He likes -- he likes to work hard.  He likes to exercise.  So, he's coming home this weekend, ah, for the summer.
L:  My kids are into swim team and gymnastics.
R:  Oh that's -- those are great sports.
L:  So, they kind of help each other out.  I mean, the --
R:  They do.
L:  -- two sports --
R:  They do.  Keep 'em in those --
L:  -- kind of -- yeah.
R:  -- because they're -- they're just great up to the college.  I mean, there's scholarships out there.  There's -- ah, there's all kinds of -- of good things that come from those.  So --
L:  But, one has a natural talent at swimming and doesn't like to do it.  And so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're always after him to -- you know, "Just one more race -- just one more", and he doesn't -- he doesn't like it.  But, he --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- can -- it's just so easy for him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Maybe that's why he doesn't like it.  I don't know.  But --
R:  That's too bad.
L:  Yeah.  But, he likes the -- the gymnastics really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I hate to push him, but if he's --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- good at it, you know, I was thinking, "Yeah, scholarship".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I tell the neighbourhood kids around here -- I said, "Every time you do a sport -- every time you take a shot, think scholarship".
L:  [LAUGH] I'm gonna have to tell that to him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Every time you take shot.
R:  Yeah.  Every time you throw a ball, just say scholarship to yourself.  So, it's -- 'cause I -- my -- my two kids say -- they both have grants but, ah, and one of 'em actually has a wrestling scholarship, but the -- then the college did away with wrestling, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's why they encouraged him to do rowing and -- and other things. [COUGH] 
L:  So, they still kept him on then?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, they still kept -- once -- once you promise that it's technically against NCWA rules for division three to get scholarship -- athletic scholarship so, um, they had to call it something else.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, even if they didn't do the sport they couldn't take it away from him.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah. [COUGH] 
L:  Well, we're getting our kids golf lessons this year, so the --
R:  There -- there we go.
L:  -- six year old.
R:  There we go.
L:  And --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and, so that'll be good for 'em so long as they aren't on a --
R:  Very good.  I -- I played golf today.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, um --
L:  As long as they walk the course, I suppose.
R:  Yes -- yeah -- yeah.  I -- I should've walked today 'cause it's -- ah, it's --
L:  Some of those courses you --
R:  -- the short --
L:  -- can't.
R:  -- course.
L:  Yeah, we live by a -- a championship golf course here right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so, it's impossible to walk.  I don't think they let you some of 'em, do they?
R:  They may not.
L:  Yeah, I don't think they do.
R:  The -- the course I was on today was the course on September eleventh that Bush's father was out on -- he and Mrs Bush were walking when the attacks on the World --
L:  Really?
R:  -- Trade Centers hit.  And -- and I used to work across the highway from this golf course, and -- and helicopters landed there and took him off --
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  -- and -- and flew him somewhere.  So, that's -- that's a claim to fame for this little golf course.  It's -- it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- beautiful little cart[?] course, and there's a lot of walking trails, ah, through it.  And, ah, of course he likes to get out and walk and meet people.  He's [COUGH] -- he was in Milwaukee for some function and, um [NOISE] -- but, it's, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a great course.  It's -- I -- I drive by it every day.  It's the first time I've played it.
L:  Well, it's supposed to be pretty good exercise, because you can do it for a long time in your life, right?
R:  Yes -- yes, you can.
