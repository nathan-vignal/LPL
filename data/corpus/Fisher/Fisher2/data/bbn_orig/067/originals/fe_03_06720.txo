R:  Hey --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'm Luca.
L:  I'm Makita.  Hi.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, this'll be a really short conversation of my part because I don't workout.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  And I have no plans of working -- well, I --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- I have no motivation to work out so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.  I used to be the same way.  I thought that I never would and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know I just -- I got a free gym membership and I actually started going.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, yeah, it was actually kinda fun.  I don't mind it too much, you know.  I think if you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- find something that you enjoy doing then it's not so much of a hassle [NOISE] basically.
L:  Yeah, it -- it's no fun for me at all.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- see I'm thinking that if actually I, like, paid to go somewhere --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would kind of talk myself into going only because I wouldn't wanna waste --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my money.
R:  Right, right [NOISE].
L:  But I don't like it [LAUGH] and I've tried -- you know, my boyfriend has tried to get me to go with him to the gym and I've done that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a couple of times --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I -- I just can't make myself go, like, on a regular basis.  It just don't -- I don't know why, I don't -- I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, what have you tried doing?
L:  I know I need to do it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  What do you try doing when you go to the gym?  Do you use the equipment --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do you do weights, do you, like, go on --
L:  Oh gosh, it's been a long time.
R:  -- an exercise bike?  What do you try?
L:  It's been so long.  Um, I think, did some running on the treadmill --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did a little bit of weight lifting but I don't like it too much --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- because I have, like, neck spasms and it hurts.
R:  Oh, well then that's no good.
L:  Which is probably -- well, yeah it's probably more of a reason for me to do it, to strengthen my muscles.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  But you have to work your way up.  I mean, you don't -- you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wanna be in pain 'cause then you're not gonna go back and do it again.
L:  Well, it's not so much pain because I would never push myself to the point where I'm like, "Oh my god, I can't, you know, move my arms".
R:  Right, right.
L:  But I -- [MN] [COUGH] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I c- I don't know, like, you know, if I were to go it isn't like I have some sort of regiment that I would go through.  I'd have no idea what I was doing.  Um, I haven't worked out regularly since, like, high school and I graduated so long ago [MN] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, you know, I -- I don't know, I just don't have the motivation.  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it would be nice 'cause, you know, toning would be wonderful but --
R:  Well, sure.
L:  I mean, no matter how skinny you are I always believe that, you know, you can always do some toning and, you know, obviously cardio would be great for anyone too --
R:  Good.
L:  -- but, I don't know, what -- what makes you go? [LAUGH]
R:  What makes me go?  Um, actually it -- it -- it turn out it -- it's the high if that makes any sense.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah, I mean, when I first started going it -- it wasn't like that at all and I really hated it and it was boring and I think it was because I -- I would, like, get on the treadmill and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the treadmill is boring.  I mean, there's just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you just -- you're walking in place, you're not getting anywhere, there's nothing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- going on and there's usually lousy music, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and I just -- I didn't enjoy it at all and finally I found something I liked.  I like Pilates.  I actually enjoy it.  I started taking a class.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that was a lot of fun 'cause I tried everything.  I tried yoga and that just -- oh goodness, I cannot think of anything more boring than yoga.  I really can't.
L:  Really?
R:  And it was terrible because I would find myself just looking around the room at all the people in their weird positions and laughing at them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which was terrible 'cause I wasn't any better at it, you know.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...   But Pilates is actually it -- it's kind of the same thing but it -- it's athletic so you -- you don't have time to look around and you actually get into it and I saw results almost immediately so that was fun too.  And once --
L:  See, I heard that yoga --
R:  -- I just doing it it was great.
L:  -- was great.  I heard yoga's wonderful.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I heard it's relaxing and the people --
R:  It is.
L:  -- I know who do it love it.
R:  It is I don't know if I'm just ADHD or what --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I just handle it.  It was so boring.  But Pilates is -- is very much like yoga.  You use a lot of the same position, you do a lot of the same stretching, you get a lot of the same flexibility training but you -- you're doing something, you're moving the whole time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you know what I mean?  So, it just --
L:  See, I've never heard of that.  
R:  -- was less boring.
L:  Never.
R:  Pilates?
L:  Mm mm.
R:  Well, it's fun, it's, um, I guess, a lot of dancers have been doing it for years and it just kinda went mainstream.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, you can usually find Pilates at most -- most gyms but --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- I don't know, I'm more into sports and stuff like that.  I haven't done anything like that in a while but I think that if I could get into something like that that would fun.  I don't know, have you ever played anything --
L:  Um --
R:  -- sports at all.
L:  Not in a long time.
R:  Not in a long time.
L:  Again, not since --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- high school and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I did tennis and track.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And [COUGH] I hated track I did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, because that's -- for most people who were on the team, like, there was just a general consensus that no one like the workouts --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just -- the day practised everyone hated it.
R:  Right [NOISE].
L:  But what you were there for were the mets and I hated --
R:  Yeah [NOISE].
L:  -- the mets too so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I got nothing from it.  Yeah, I was in shape, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- had beautiful runners' legs but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I got no enjoyment out of it.  I didn't care when I won, I didn't care when I lost, I just did not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- care.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So, basically, it just became something to do to stay in shape for tennis 'cause I really enjoyed tennis --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even though I was extremely bad at it I just loved tennis --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- so that was -- yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty much the best --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- source of, you know, fitness I ever had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was tennis and that was many, many, many, many, many years ago so ...
R:  What [NOISE] does your boyfriend play?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] he's more into martial arts --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE] Cool.
L:  -- what was he doing?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He was -- he wasn't doing Aikido I think he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was doing Tae Kwon Do.
R:  [NOISE] Oh wonderful. [NOISE]
L:  But he quit. [LAUGH] Well, now we're both out of college so there really isn't like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- a free thing for him to do any more.
R:  Mhm, mhm.  I hear you.
L:  'Cause [inaudible] to find the time so ...
R:  Yeah, it gets more expensive especially depending on where you are.  
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know where you are but --
L:  Oh, I'm in Philadelphia so ...
R:  Oh, well then it's not so hard.  I'm in Philadelphia too.  There's lots of places to do that.
L:  Yeah, there are but I just --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] don't go.  So, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [MN] I work at Temple and --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- actually, you know, being an employee there they have like a wonderful, wonderful, like, facility to work out at --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- and that's kind of motivation to go --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I heard it's beautiful, it's new.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Um, doesn't really cost that much for me to just join and go.
R:  Right, right. [NOISE]
L:  But, you know, [LAUGH] I -- I can't do it.  I can't do it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've had many friends that have tried --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to push me in that direction, um, and it'll last for a little while and then it just kind of, you know, tapers off into nothing and --
R:  Right, right.
L:  [MN].
R:  Well, do you walk?  I mean, do you have a car, d- are you driving everywhere?
L:  I drive everywhere.
R:  You drive?
L:  I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  No -- no, I get no exercise at all.  I -- I'm surprised that my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- heart's still beating right now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with all the junk food I eat because it isn't even like I'm eating --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as well as I should either it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- it's pretty bad.
R:  Right.  It's just -- it's so easy to slip into those habits, it's just -- it's easier.  You know, it's easier to drive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it's easier to pick up, you know, fast food, cheese steaks here all right, that's the big thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- it's easier, yeah, you know.
L:  Oh definitely.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If you have the choice between sitting in front of a TV and eating popcorn or, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going for a jog which one are you going --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to probably do, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And I've never experienced that high that people get that you were talking about --
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  -- when you're endorphins kick in.
R:  Right.  Exactly [NOISE].
L:  I've never -- I've never gotten that, I don't know what it is, I've never experienced it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, even less motivation to go work out.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause, you know --
R:  Well, it -- it takes a while, it didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it didn't just happen at all and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- it took me about -- probably about two months before I really thought anything like that.
L:  See --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- two months can be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- very long.
R:  Brutal, yes.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think the only reason I ended up going consistently was that I had someone that I was going with, you know so --
L:  Yeah.  Helps too having company.
R:  Exactly, yes.  Some days he didn't want go, you know, I'd be like, "No, you have to go" and then vice a versa and it helps a lot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Well, maybe my boyfriend will beat me back into it.  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause he had me going for a little while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then I stopped and then he kinda stopped because I wasn't going and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he started up again, like, just working out in the house but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's more just like the weights and stuff which --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I'm really not too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, in to.  I could see myself --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- joining like a class or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That would be -- 'cause, you know, with the group thing there's music --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- playing --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- the people around you are constantly moving and it's really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like structured so that you can't just say, "I'm done" and walk away, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You want to stay there for, like, the full hour --
R:  Forty minutes --
L:  -- because -- right.
R:  Mhm, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, I -- I think that's a good way for someone like me to go. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's -- I mean, that -- that's still what I do when I go.  That's what I do pretty much because everything else bores.  I don't wanna lift weights either --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  'Cause I -- I don't wanna bulk up and I don't wanna take the time to meet with a trainer --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and find out exactly what I should be doing.  I'm lazy too, [LAUGH] you know, I am.  But I can just go in and take this Pilates, you know, and maybe get on the electrical for, like, twenty minutes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm good.  You know, I'm good to go.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's only just like an hour out of day, that's it.
L:  Right.
R:  So, it's not a big deal.
L:  See it's not really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that much of a commitment it's just [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I hear you [NOISE], I agree.
L:  You know, and I keep saying I'm gonna do it.  I know I should do it --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- definitely should do it I just --
R:  [NOISE]
