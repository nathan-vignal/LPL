R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Karen.
L:  Hi, I'm Sherry.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm fine. 
R:  Good, good.
L:  A little tried.  I worked all day.
R:  [LAUGH] So maybe you're not in the mood to talk about exercise. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Just talking, [LAUGH] that's fine. 
R:  Ri- -- [LAUGH] so we're supposed to talk about -- ah, I thought I caught that we're supposed to talk about exercise --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, how did you -- [MN] what di- -- what did you gather the topic was?
L:  Yeah, e- e- exercise and fitness.
R:  Okay, so what do -- what do you do?
L:  Well, mostly just walking.
R:  Okay.  And around your neighborhood, or ...?
L:  Yeah, and, um, there's a track o- over at the high school, I go down there a lot of times when there's no sporting events going on. 
R:  Right.  Are you in a warm climate?
L:  Yeah, in Indiana.
R:  Oh, Indiana. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm in Ohio. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that's not too far off then, is it?
R:  No, no, not at all.  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, we -- I have, um, a walking pass, ah, like, right around my neighborhood, um, and it's, I think, like, one point eight miles and I usually try to get out early, you know, in the morning --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, it takes me usually about twenty minutes, 'cause I move pretty fast.  But I feel so good, I -- I have to talk myself into it [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but once I do it, I, you know, I feel really good. 
L:  I need to do more that what I do, that I know, but I make the effort. 
R:  Right, right.
L:  I've got an exercise bike, but I don't [LIPSMACK] -- use it very rarely. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uncomfortable to sit on it.
R:  Right, and it's sometimes -- sometimes it gets boring.  I -- I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I seem to find, um, many times if I go to a garage sale, um, that the exercise equipment in -- is usually for sale, you know --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- frequently. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  People -- I just -- like, it's amazing, you know, the -- the financial investment that is made.  I mean, I have a piece of walking equipment, you know, or, um, treadmill, um, and, you know, I have used it, but I'd rather be outdoors --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know.  Do you walk when it's cold?
L:  I- if the wind's not blowing real hard.  I can't hardly stand that. 
R:  Right, right.  It's hard, especially this last winter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I decided that I would walk -- I would not walk if it was icy or if there was any, um, any, you know, thought that I could possibly fall, I just didn't think that it was, you know, worth it [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I don't get out on the ice either. 
R:  Right.  So, do you do any other kind of exercise or it's just the walking?
L:  Basically just the walking.  [inaudible] what exercise you get through housework and mowing the yard --
R:  Right.  Do you have a large yard that you mow?
L:  Yeah.  I've got eight lots.  
R:  Wow.
L:  So part of it I do with a -- a riding mower, but the two around the house I have to use a push mower.
R:  Wow.   Well, that keeps you in shape.  Ah, is there anything else that, ah -- have you ever gone to an exercise class?
L:  I did, but it was years ago.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  I find I really enjoyed, um -- I didn't care for t- the music particularly, 'cause some of it was rather wild, but I did enjoy the jazzercise.  I -- I did that once, there was some kind of a discount and I really en- enjoyed it, except it was hard for me to quickly pick up the st- -- [LAUGH] the steps, you know. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, other than that, I really, you know, I really enjoyed it.  But they -- they say that the overall best exercise is, um, walking.  So, do you have any health challenges?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Do you have any health challenges at all that --
L:  Um, yeah --
R:  -- that you're --
L:  -- I've gotten a hip joint that's getting kind of bad.
R:  Oh.
L:  And sometimes, you know, it's worse than others.
R:  Right, but can you -- can you -- I mean, does that aggravate when you walk then?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Wow.  Well, I think, at least in our area, it seems like the weather has broken and it's a lot easier to get out and of course, you know, I think we're an hour difference, a- are we not?  Like, right now I think it -- well, see what --
L:  It's about seven here -- a little after. 
R:  A little after seven?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, that's what it is here.  Hm.  So we must be -- lemme see.  Let me have a look at my watch.  I take that back.  I think it is a little -- it is after eight.  So we're an hour different.  So wh- -- you usually walk in the morning?
L:  On the weekends and then in the evening on -- through the week. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then sometimes on -- on my lunch hour I'll get out and walk a little. 
R:  Wow.  But do you usually have someone to walk with?
L:  No, I'll wait sometimes if someone will.
R:  Right.
L:  I've got a sister that walks a lot too.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's good.  Do you enjoy the, um, [LIPSMACK] the calling and talking on these subjects?
L:  Well, this is my second call.  It's kinda fun.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I really enjoy it.  This is my second one as well.  And, um, you know, it's just -- it's interesting to be able to talk to someone you've never met [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- about, you know, topics.  Um, but anyway, the on- -- you know, the -- I ordinarily have to walk, you know, by myself, but I, you know, I enjoy it.  You know, it would be nice, I usually pass people that are walking, but, ah, I just feel better once I do it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  
L:  I lie, in the early morning I prefer being alone.  
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know why, but ...
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  It's just peaceful. 
R:  Right.  Right.  Do you have, like, a -- a fairly, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, like, a -- a neighborhood with lots of trees, where you ...?
L:  Ah, yes.  
R:  Right, so that -- that, I mean, it's just so pretty, you know, it's -- and do you have or have the occasion to be chased by a dog or anything like that?
L:  No, not yet.  
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I don't either.  Actually we're -- the city we live in, they have a leash law --
L:  [inaudible] here too.
R:  -- although some people don't abide by it.  A- and I had one bad experience once on my -- my walking path and that was with a doberman. [MN]
L:  Oh.  That'd be scary. 
R:  Yes, it was and, um, [LIPSMACK] but other than that, um, and then after -- f- for a while I just carried a stick. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just in -- just in case. [LAUGH] But, um, [MN] but more, you know, more often than, you know, I -- I don't have any problems.  So, um, do you -- do you have, um, like, do -- do your family -- does your family, besides your sister, walk, or just you?
L:  [MN] Just me.  
R:  Just you.
L:  They should, but they don't.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- it seems as though we get so busy.  I find, you know, myself, that I always seem to put other pe- -- you know, my family ahead of myself and then I -- well, I can't get out now because I have to do this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so, ah, but now I seem to have a little bit more time, you know, to get out.  I -- I, ah, I have a crossing guard, um, part time for the police department, that I do in the morning, during the school year obviously, and I try to get my walk in before I go, 'cause if I -- I -- I feel like if I don't get it in the morning, I might not get it in.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then lately -- we live in a -- a -- we have a lot of grocery stores, like the big chain stores, even though we -- we are in a small town, but I -- I tell myself [MN] whenever I can, I'm going to walk to the gr- -- the grocery store that, [LIPSMACK] oh, I would say it's roughly [LIPSMACK] three or four blocks, and that would give me an extra walk. 
L:  And you can cover a lot of distance if you go up and down every aisle in one of those stores.  
R:  That's true. 
L:  But you're just not usually keeping a very good pace.
R:  Right.
L:  But still, you're burning a few calories. 
R:  That's true.  And we have, um -- there's a shopping mall, it's -- its, like, not a real big mall, it's in -- in the, ah, [LIPSMACK] Toledo area and, um, I went to -- i- -- I -- it's not real far, you know, real far, but I went there, um, once to -- to walk because the weather was so bitter and the only thing with that is I -- I found that I, um, got competitive --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because there were a lot of other people walking and I didn't like anybody ahead of me. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] So I was really wor- -- I was worn out [LAUGH] when I left, but I could, you know, pretty much, um, keep -- keep the pace, you know, even the younger women, [LIPSMACK] but, um, anyway I thought -- I only did that once. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Bit more i- -- more often than that I just walk outside. [LIPSMACK] Do you have a pet that you can walk?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  No, me neither.
L:  I've got cats.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And don't think that they'd be much into that.
R:  No, no.  I went on a walk once, and my -- my daughter, who is now gone, um, t- to college, but she's tried to walk the cat and it didn't work real well. [LAUGH] So ...
L:  I've often thought I'd like taking a yoga class.  Have you ever tried that?
R:  No, no.  I -- what appeals to you?
L:  Well, it -- supposedly good for, um, [LIPSMACK] your mental state too and helps lower blood pressure, besides stretching your muscles and all that.
R:  Right.
L:  [several inaudible words]
