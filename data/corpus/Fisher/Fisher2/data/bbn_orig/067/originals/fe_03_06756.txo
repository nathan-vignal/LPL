R:  Hi, this is Suzie. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi, this is Simone.
R:  [NOISE] Simone? [NOISE] 
L:  Yes. 
R:  Hi, nice to meet you. [NOISE] 
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  [NOISE] Where are you located? [NOISE] 
L:  I'm in northern California, how about you?
R:  I'm in central Illinois.
L:  Ah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How's the weather out there?
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] It is beautiful here, but actually [NOISE] a bit south of us they've got tornadoes. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, I'm glad it's beautiful there. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, is -- is it raining there?
L:  [SIGH] No, no, we're having a warm spell for this area --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but it's really pretty.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good that it's pretty. [SIGH] We were just out west for the first time and [NOISE] I was in Colorado and New Mexico for the first time in my life. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, that's -- that's beautiful country.   How did you like it?
R:  [NOISE] I really did.  I -- I've always flown over it [NOISE] when I've gone --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to business meetings in California, [SIGH] but it -- it was really nice to [NOISE] see it from the ground. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  Don't they have the most incredible sunsets there?
R:  [SIGH] Yes, they do, they do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was surprised, though, by all the poverty [NOISE] in New Mexico.
L:  Really?  Yeah.
R:  I've never seen so many people living out of [NOISE] vehicles in my life. [NOISE] [MN] 
L:  I guess I didn't go through that point.
R:  Yeah, w- well w- we were by Taos. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, okay, I didn't go through there.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I don't know, it's just very sad. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But I guess we're supposed to talk about September eleventh. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Speaking of sad topics. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yes, exactly. [NOISE] [SIGH] Exactly. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Have you made changes in your life?
R:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] actually, [SIGH] I -- it's kind of -- I guess related to September eleventh, [SIGH] [NOISE] I got married last October --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH] and, um, we were supposed to go to Bali for our honeymoon. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Very excited about it, um, [NOISE] the week before, um, [NOISE] we were to leave, [SIGH] uh, [NOISE] they had that terrorist bombing that killed all the Westerners [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in Bali. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so we didn't end up going.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And, uh, I think it was a, I guess, direct [SIGH] thing after September eleventh, 'cause it goes with all the terrorist junk. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But other than that, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] I think I would go right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which [NOISE] -- I have friends who are in the CIA. [NOISE] -- [SIGH] well, one friend in particular who always telling me I'm stupid for [NOISE] wanting to go still --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- because the world's too unsound. [NOISE] 
L:  Is that right?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  [NOISE] How about you? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't know if it's a direct --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess it's -- it's, uh, it's related --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to September eleventh, although indirectly.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  Um, --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I am around a lot --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- more people who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- are involved in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- prayers for peace --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've begun to participate --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I began to participate in them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- oh, a few months ago.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And I just find myself a lot more concerned with world peace --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- than I ever was before --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I find myself making --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a more [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- considered effort to -- to bring peace into my life --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, and, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] to find what's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uplifting and what works and what's good --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and what I can do.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- which I don't think I ever did before that.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, it's come slowly since September eleventh, but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think it's a result of it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- although it came through other people --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I think maybe that's what --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- gave me the -- the impetus to do it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think that's -- I think that's something that I think everyone's doing to one [SIGH] degree or another.  It sounds like you're doing that a bit more than I am. [LAUGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] I -- I pray for it, but, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] I also get those, I guess, irritated feelings [SIGH] at our government for sticking our nose where it doesn't belong [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then, I'm, on the other hand, very patriotic too and I'm proud that [NOISE] I'm an American and glad --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that I'm an American [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, you know, with the [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] stuff about Israel and Palestine, [SIGH] I mean, why are we there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And I think the -- I -- I've got friends who are Muslim --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I'm not Muslim, I'm Christian, but, um, [SIGH] it -- I feel very bad for them, um, because [SIGH] that's not the -- the way that the Taliban now is not what the Koran says.
L:  [SIGH] Right, it's not really even connected to the religion.  I mean --
R:  No.
L:  -- from what I can see they've really distorted Islam.
R:  Mohammed preached, um, [NOISE] peace.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He also preached [LAUGH] equality for women, but, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that got passed over too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, boy.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] But I just, I don't know -- and all the hatred that's come from that, I -- I find that extremely dismaying and I'm pretty outspoken about, um, people -- I mean, especially in central Illinois, I'm from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the east coast originally [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but some people in this area are extremely provincial, [SIGH] and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, I guess redneck is a good word to use. [SIGH] Um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] but, um -- and I'm, I guess, opinionated to the point of stupid at times [SIGH] and if somebody starts saying something [SIGH] about Muslims etcetera, I just, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't hold back and [SIGH] kind of try to correct them in their --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thinking although --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it probably doesn't work because I'm mad when I'm doing it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] But --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] H- have you had any experiences with, uh, I guess backlash after September eleventh?  Any friends or family or [SIGH] ?
L:  No, no, no, my family, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well, the only problem I had in my family is I've got some members of my family who are very political in the sense that they've become, in my opinion, rabid peace mongers, and I don't --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- see a big difference in -- in what they're doing, I just see a difference in sort of what they're saying should be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and, so I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- specifically don't talk about that with them --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, uh, to keep family peace I don't hang out with them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- quite as much.
R:  Yeah, that's a --
L:  'Cause I don't want to break up the family over it, but, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I just don't see how you can get peace from hate.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  It doesn't make sense to me, but, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's just -- that's sort of the satellite family.  Within my family itself, there's been no change, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my whole family's always been about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] that we're all children --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- of the one god, what -- whatever path --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you follow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What matters is how you treat other people, not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, [SIGH] what's stamped on your forehead. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Right, well, yeah, no I -- I'm a strong -- I have a strong belief that [SIGH] all religions, um, no matter if you're [SIGH] Jew, Christian, Hindu --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] um, Baha'i, whatever, I think they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just different paths to the same end. [SIGH] A lot of people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- disagree with me, but, [SIGH] um, my sister is also a rabid peace monger, and, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she's always ripping on the government and [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've gotten so angry with her, I say, "Well, why don't you move and renege your citizenship, then?" [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, we don't talk about it any more either. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] It's kind of like you said, bringing more peace into your life by --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- not talking [LAUGH] about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause sometimes it --
L:  [SIGH] I may try that one, though. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] [SIGH] They stop for a minute, because they don't expect that. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] It -- it only halts them for a second though. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, sometimes a second is, you know, is -- is --
R:  Classic. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- worth [LAUGH] --
R:  [SIGH] Especially if there are other people around to appreciate it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] That's too funny.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, god, that's funny. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I get -- I guess the other thing that [NOISE] I have changed, it's something so minor, but [SIGH] whenever I fly now I wear clogs.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes, I wear, uh --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, some type of, like, clogs, slip on shoes.  They don't necessarily look like clogs but, [SIGH] you know, just --
L:  And why do you do that?
R:  [SIGH] Because I [MN] -- I [LIPSMACK] -- I'm like the -- I look like the corn fed Midwesterner that I'm not. [SIGH] Um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I get stopped and pulled aside at every single airport line.
L:  Really?
R:  [SIGH] I -- yeah, I'm -- [SIGH] so, I'm thirty one, five seven, [SIGH] lighter hair, Caucasian, blue eyes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I'm -- I'm friendly, I make eye contact with people and I like to smile at people 'cause I think that's what the world should be about is communicating with others.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And I always [LAUGH] get pulled aside and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- have the other search.  So, it's easier, after I saw on my first trip, a girl -- I j- had just worn clog type shoes that day just because I did [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and this girl had on knee high boots and a long skirt, like a s- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- pencil skirt. [SIGH] I'm [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] clogs it is. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause she had to sit there and yank up her skirt, there's no place to sit, [SIGH] try to get her boots off. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, that -- the other serious thing, an I put everything in zip lock bags, like, inside my toiletry [SIGH] areas --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I get pulled aside to go through the big, um, [SIGH] I don't -- I don't know what they are, the big bomb things that they put your bags through now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness.  So, because you're making eye contact?
R:  [SIGH] I don't know if that's it or not, I just -- I always seem to get pulled aside.
L:  Huh.
R:  Maybe I look evil [LIPSMACK] and I don't know it. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I doubt that, based on some of the people they've let pass through.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I think if you're African American, if you're Caucasian, if you're [SIGH] Indian or Indian American, like, India Indian --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- American, I mean, you can tell we're Americans, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's just -- we have something, [SIGH] that's kind of a little more brazen than the rest of world about us --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and a confidence that others [SIGH] don't carry like Americans do and --
L:  That's true, they don't have the same freedom.
R:  Yeah, I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think it's a race, I think it's a people, if that makes sense.
L:  A culture thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a culture thing.
L:  That makes sense, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And here they pull aside, you know, Americans [SIGH] and they let other people go through, um, [NOISE] and, you know, everybody talks about racial profiling and stuff, but I guess in [SIGH] Israel, in the airports --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there they do that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and they haven't had any bombings.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] And I don't -- I don't know, it is a double edged sword, though, because I have Muslim friends who are Middle Easterners and [SIGH] not all Muslims are Middle Eastern [SIGH] and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- y- uh, it's -- [SIGH] I don't know, it's one of those double edged swords.
L:  [MN]
