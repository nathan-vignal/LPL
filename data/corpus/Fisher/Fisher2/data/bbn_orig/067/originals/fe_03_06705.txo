R:  [SIGH] Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [SIGH] Hi, my name is Dina.
L:  Hi, Dina, this is Logan.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Okay.
L:  [SIGH] Good.
R:  A little --
L:  Um, is the --
R:  -- a little wet, it's raining.
L:  Uh-oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, we finally have nice weather. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, so, as to the topic, I actually just joined a gym today.
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  Yeah, after --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- months of being a little lax.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
L:  Um, so, yeah, I -- I, uh, did some treadmill and some weight lifting and swam in the pool for a little bit.
R:  Wow.
L:  I'm hoping to be a little more diligent about that over the next few months, just not for life. [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
R:  I had belonged to a gym --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it -- it -- [SIGH] I don't know, it wasn't [NOISE] -- it wasn't exciting enough for me. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a little bit intimidating tool but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] my husband and I bought a -- [SIGH] a recumbent bicycle --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that we use at home.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] Plus, uh, I have two small children --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I think that [LAUGH] -- I don't know why that doesn't qualify as an [LAUGH] exercise --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- pr- [SIGH] I would say I -- I run around so much, I should weigh, like, a hundred pounds --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [SIGH] but, um, [SIGH] I w- I could -- I could foresee, uh, [MN] joining a gym again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but for now, um, [SIGH] I think -- I -- I -- it -- uh, it sounds like a cop out, but I -- I run around so much that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] I think I burn up a lot of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] c-
L:  Calories doing that.
R:  -- calories and energy just -- just [COUGH] doing that because [SIGH] I've lost weight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and not [COUGH] -- not even tried.
L:  Right.
R:  Which is great, right?
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] But, [LIPSMACK] um, [SIGH] I -- I wouldn't say that I'm probably a fitness buff as --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- most other people are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just, uh, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- never -- never been my thing.  I've joined a bunch of gyms and I think probably [SIGH] I'll [MN] -- I'll do better [LIPSMACK] doing things at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And -- and we have a pool at home.
L:  Oh, well, that's great.
R:  W- We're in Florida, everybody has a [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- everybody has a pool, it's like, uh -- [SIGH] it's like if you're up north you have a basement, down here everybody has a pool. [SIGH] 
L:  Right, I have a -- uh, I don't -- I live in a [LIPSMACK] -- oh, in an apartment building in New York, [SIGH] but unfortunately no basement.
R:  [SIGH] I always get somebody --
L:  So 
R:  -- uh, we're from New York, I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- always get somebody from New York on these --
L:  That's funny.
R:  -- surveys, never anywhere from the Midwest or anything. 
L:  Huh, they might do that on purpose.
R:  Do you th-
L:  Uh, I think that if you have something a little more in common, you might keep talking, I don't know.
R:  Uh, yeah, they -- they must, I mean, w-
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- are you in Manhattan?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Huh. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] It's so funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We were -- we moved from New Rochelle[?] about three years ago.
L:  Mhm, mhm, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And that was an exercise, uh, program in and of itself. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] [SIGH] Which --
L:  [SIGH] Well, I, uh --
R:  [SIGH] Which club did you join?
L:  Uh, actually, I joined, um, the River State -- uh, the Riverbank State Park.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which is, um, up at a hundred and forty fifth --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- right off of the high- like, right on top of the highway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You've seen it when you drive by the -- uh, down the Henry Hudson.
R:  Uh-huh, d- uh, th- that's what I was thinking when you said that.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's the best deal in the city.  I hope they don't get the word out. [LAUGH] It's, like -- it's fifty three dollars for three months.
R:  What?
L:  Yeah, to have access --
R:  [SIGH] Boy, for that I'd -- I'd fly up [LAUGH] to New York --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a couple of days.
L:  Yeah, to have access to the gym, [SIGH] um, and then the pool, if you want to use the pool, it's either twenty dollars a month or two dollars a visit. [SIGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  It's still pretty good, and they give you a locker to use and everything.
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] There's a lot of places down here.  There are a lot of chains, L.A. Fitness --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Ballies[?] --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and [NOISE] a lot -- [SIGH] um, y- you can't -- you can't drive more than a mile without --
L:  Mhm, hitting one. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but it's also a very outdoor lifestyle, I mean, you're --
L:  Exactly, that's true.
R:  -- constantly outdoors here, you're constantly --
L:  That's true.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Doing stuff.
R:  -- doing stuff and walking places, we don't get to hibernate and stay inside.
L:  Right, that's true.
R:  [SIGH] Except --
L:  'Cause we get snowed in.
R:  -- except for these torrential downpours --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that we're having today.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was like, "Oh, great".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Got rid of those [NOISE] ten feet of snow and now we got hurricane season.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, [SIGH] I'm, uh [SIGH] -- I wouldn't say I've ever been a lover of exercise.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I mean, I know there are some people who really, really like it, endorphins --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and all that.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] I don't think I've ever -- if -- even if I had a regular exercise plan I really would have to -- I would really have to push it.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And I'm not -- I'm not overweight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, like, everybody, there's certain areas that --
L:  Yeah, you could always -- you always think, "It would be nice to do this or do that". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you know, and there's certain areas also that you can exercise forever and they're not going to change.
L:  True, very true.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I think, uh, for me, I was in very good shape all thr- like most people, through high school, and pretty much through college and then --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I'm a chef, so that really doesn't help things at all. [SIGH] So, uh, [NOISE] I've -- I've been fighting the battle -- plus I just got into a great relationship and we're --
R:  Oh, when you're in a great relationship you're always [LAUGH] eating more.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Eating more, drinking more, going out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being social. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, uh --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- we -- we've both committed that for the next, you know, three months we're just really going to take it seriously and [SIGH] -- uh, and, uh --
R:  yeah, and I have, like, a bad diet.  Like, I wake up in the morning and have coffee and then I --
L:  right.
R:  -- run around all day, don't eat anything and then it --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] and then I wonder, like, "Why do I have a headache and why do I feel tired?"
L:  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH] And I know it's because [SIGH] -- you know, I know the topic is --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- was it health and fitness, or just fitness?
L:  I think it's health and fitness, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they asked if, uh, did you think it would improve your life if you did work out --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- or do you work out, don't you work out.
R:  Yeah, I w- I [COUGH] -- recently I've gone through some [SIGH] -- a battery of blood tests for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something that was coming up badly and --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
R:  -- they -- they tested me for lupus --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, three times --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and th- they said -- the doctor said to me, "Do you -- tell me, do your joints hurt?" [NOISE] They're right over here, Shane.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] He said, "Do your joints hurt?"  I said, "Do my joints hurt?" [SIGH] I have a four year and a seven year old --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I live in Florida, I run around like a chicken without a head --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I work part time --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- secretary of the P.T.A., of course my joints hurt.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ask all my friends, their joints hurt too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Like, "What are you talking about?" [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [LAUGH] 
R:  He goes -- he was a Chi-
L:  Life demands it. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- Chinese doctor, he goes, "Can you discuss -- not good question?"  I said, "No, not good question [LAUGH] at all". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I said, "I don't know anybo- I don't know any of my friends --"
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  "-- who don't say their joints hurt --"
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  "-- by the end of the day". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] that's true.  Yeah, I find that, you know, after -- [NOISE] if I have to stand a lot -- well, I stand for work, [SIGH] so, you know, if I put in a twenty hour [NOISE] day, yeah, [NOISE] everything hurts. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But, yeah, so, we'll see. 
R:  Oh, that -- that's my -- that's my fitness plan --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for the time being.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it just, uh -- it's just generally [SIGH] running around.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I always keep saying when I lift the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- laundry basket and --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I've swept things from one end of the house to the other, I'm like --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- "This has got to count for something".
L:  Oh, definitely, I mean, look at the guys who do nothing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] but, uh, you know, lift bales of hay.
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  [SIGH] That's exercise, so I think laundry --
R:  Right.
L:  -- counts as exercise. [NOISE] 
R:  So I think -- I think they ought to add up the -- like, caloric --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, uh, content used --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with, [SIGH] you know -- [SIGH] to -- the driving to the --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- school and the picking up of the -- [SIGH] all of the stuff, I mean, I used to be a --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- management executive in Manhattan --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] paid to sit in a nice office.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] On my butt. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, you get more exercise now.
R:  Right, and -- and I -- I would kill -- I would kill to be able to just sit down somewhere for five hours. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But, it's like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- no, no, I'm like -- and of course I -- I worked for a company that had, like, a beautiful fitness center --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- and --
L:  Right, but you were too busy to use it back then.
R:  Yeah, I was too busy, like, going out and drinking and eating and having --
L:  Right.
R:  -- fun and --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- being single.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] So, I have [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nothing else to--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- say, I think it's great --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that people work out, I'm happy for them, it's like --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- people who are, you know [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, born again or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- vegetarians or whatever, I'm very happy for you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- le- lead a good life and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I'll do what I want to do. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [SIGH] Well, I know I've put on quite a lot of weight in the last -- [MN] it's been pretty steady over the last, like, two years, [SIGH] so, um, I figured if I didn't do it now I was going to end up like one of those obese statistics --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] um, probably not, but still, it was --
R:  I tell you, it --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- gets much harder, I mean, I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm -- I'm forty five years old and it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- gotten [SIGH] harder to lose weight --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the older I've gotten.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  -- I just turned thirty --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it's -- it's -- it's changing. [LAUGH] 
R:  It just -- believe me, your whole bo- [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's -- it's all down hill form here now. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now -- and then wait till you have kids. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know. [NOISE] My fiance [SIGH] and [NOISE] I were [LAUGH] talking, and I said, "Well, I'd better get it off now, otherwise I am seriously screwed". [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you got -- y -- y-
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- although -- although the fir- the first one I gained sixty five pounds and I lost --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eight five afterwards.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That was called the I'm so stressed out, I'm a new mother diet.
L:  Got it, got it.
R:  Better than any --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- fitness plan.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- but now I'm down to, like, you know, like a hundred and thirty five pounds.
L:  Oh, that's great, I -- I fondly remember one thirty five. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  What?
L:  [SIGH] I fondly remember --
R:  You fondly --
L:  -- [LAUGH] one thirty five. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  -- remember. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It's funny, when I look at pictures of myself when I was at that weight -- and of course when I was at that weight it wasn't thin enough, [SIGH] and now it's --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- like, "Gosh, I would just love to do one thirty five again".
R:  Did you go to, um, Hyde Park?
L:  Yeah, I did --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I went to C.I.A. 
R:  You did?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Ooh, I'm impressed.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I love that place.
L:  yeah, I did, uh, the whole, uh -- the two year program.
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] My, uh -- my --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- folks just love to go to the restaurants --
L:  They're really good.
R:  -- that they have there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and [SIGH] I have a cousin who's a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- French chef, but he didn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go there, he went to the one in the city.
L:  Oh, the French Culinary?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, yeah, a good friend of mine is the, uh, [NOISE] [SIGH] uh, assistant adminstra- uh --
