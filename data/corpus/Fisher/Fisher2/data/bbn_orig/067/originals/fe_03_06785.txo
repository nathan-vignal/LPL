R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Sharon.
R:  Hi, I'm Marina.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Um, okay, so we're going to talk about September eleventh.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, what changes we made --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- since then.
R:  How did you feel about September eleventh?
L:  [NOISE] Um, well, you know, pretty devastated, you know, it -- I knew people lived there -- back there -- you know, that were okay, but [COUGH] and then I also knew, um, a stewardess, ah, who worked for American Airlines.  Like I called her that day, I remember.  But, you know, she -- un -- ah, fortunately she wasn't flying that day. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] So, um -- but if I -- it seems like so unreal, like every time I saw on TV it was like I thought it was a movie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- or something. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] It didn't seem like it -- it happened.  [COUGH] But, ah, as far as changes, you know, I -- I still, you know, travel.  Ah, you know, last spring I went back east, um, but just -- you know, I think more aware of, you know, people or -- you know, as far as like terrorist type people [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And, ah, just appreciating the family more and, you know, trying to, ah, you know, live each day, you know, to the fullest 'cause you never know [LAUGH] you know, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- whether it's going to be your last.  So [COUGH] --
R:  So you did, ah -- you did make some slight changes?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah I think so.  Just, you know, I  -- I think it's, ah, more a attitude change about things.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] So, yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE] How 'bout you?
R:  -- um, I was pretty much, ah -- I -- I would have made some changes maybe for the first, um, six months after it ha- happened.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  But, I think ever since I'm kind of like ah, I'm -- I didn't forget about it but I'm like back to normal again.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Like, um, at first I was kind of scared and --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, I -- I feel threatened, um, and -- and I was looking out for like terrorist type of people too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And, um -- but, um, yeah, it -- I pretty much am over it now --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I've been over it for like a year, so no --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I don't -- uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and, you know, ah, living life like, you know, back to normal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] So just, you know, I guess we all have to go through the extra security kind of things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Yeah, I guess this is good anyway 'cause, um, you know, um, airplanes -- I think that there was not enough security anywhere.  I mean anyone --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- could have just sneaked in like, I don't know, a bomb in your luggage --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- or something.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  So I think that was good anyway.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And, ah, I have a job that I -- I'm -- I'm a hiatus right for the filming but I worked at the studios and I know they tightened all their security, like, especially, like, ah, the Warner Brothers studio.  They didn't let anybody drive onto the lot.  You had to park, you know, in a parking structure.  And some people complain about it and stuff, but, you know, we didn't want them walking around by themselves and things. [LAUGH]  But, you know, you gotta -- you never know --
R:  Oh, yeah that changed too, huh?
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH] Yes, I mean, you know, you don't know people.  You know, you're okay but the next person may be, you know, have something in their walk on and, you know, blow something up, so --
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I think it's true that a lot of like buildings have changed their security, ah, procedures also.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  I remember in, um, Chicago, um [LIPSMACK] the Court --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um, yeah, everybody had to like show -- show ID or -- or like, um, pass a metal detector when they --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- um, when they came in.  So --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and that was a change too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I think the subway is still not protected.  Like, if you think of like New York or something --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think that people that are going on the subway have to, like, pass a security check or a metal detector or anything.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.  So I guess it could be better. [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what I think.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  What do you think?
L:  [NOISE] Um, I'd have to find out what the, you know, regulations are.  I remember when I was, ah, flying back east, you know, that, like, you couldn't carry anything like a nail file, scissors [LAUGH] anything that could be used as a weapon, you know?
R:  No, I was talking about --
L:  [NOISE] Nothing like that.
R:  -- the subway.
L:  [NOISE] What?
R:  The subway in New York.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, the subway?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't know if there's a --
R:  Yeah, this I don't know either.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Where do you live?
R:  I- in LA.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Me too. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I heard it. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Um, but, um, yeah I lived in New York for a full month.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  And, um, everybody there's using the subway and it's --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- kind of like, very, um, crowded and everybody kind of has to use it so --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- if somebody wanted to attack a lot of New Yorkers, I guess they would --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- attack the subway.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know --
R:  But, I'm not sure.
L:  [NOISE] -- I don't know what they could do about it for, you know [LAUGH] people are always rushing to work and stuff there on the subways, so I don't know how they would, you know, try to handle it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know either.
L:  [NOISE] It would be a nightmare.  No --
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- did anything like -- would you still travel, um, outside of the US after what happened?
L:  [NOISE] Um, yeah, to certain places.  You know, I -- you know, there's certain countries I'd still like to see, you know, like Europe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  But you wouldn't want to like go to the Middle East?
L:  [NOISE] No. [LAUGH]  I never --
R:  No.
L:  [NOISE] -- did before anyway.
R:  Oh, so that hasn't changed?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I never had a desire to go there.
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And, um, did your attitude towards Middle Eastern people change?
L:  [NOISE] Um, no, not really.  I mean I -- um, the people I knew personally, you know, they're okay and, you know, I don't really know that many Middle Eastern people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] But -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] -- I think, ah, in the first month or so, um, you know, maybe when you see someone you're kind of suspicious [LAUGH] but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- you know, that -- that went away after a while.
R:  Yeah, yeah, probably.  That's true.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE] But that -- I think that was -- that's a natural reaction. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think you couldn't really avoid it, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
R:  -- I remember when I, um, was going on a plane --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, there was like a guy and he looked -- I don't know, he looked really like Indian.  He was by himself --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and -- yeah, I kind of felt uncomfortable with him on that plane.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I mean, he didn't do anything, it's just --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- he kind of like matched the [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- so, yeah, I felt uncomfortable.  And then, um, one time I flew and I was trying to play my, um -- you know, the -- the thing you put in so your car can't be stolen?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, the club?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And [LAUGH] -- and they found it in my luggage and I didn't even think of it as not, you know, being okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And they're like, "Why do you bring this?" you know.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  "Why are trying to bring this on the airplane?"  I'm like, "Oh, I'm sorry". 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  And then, um, I had to throw it away.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I remember, um, often when I was flying, ah, you know, they were, like, checking people's shoes and stuff.  I didn't get checked but I guess it was kind of a random thing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, your shoes, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But I saw people getting checked.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] You know?
R:  Yeah, that's true.  And -- that's true.  I don't know it was just scary and I was also, um, a little scary of like a -- a bioterrorist.  'Cause they had the anthrax cases afterwards.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And did it ever turn out who was behind them?
L:  [NOISE] Um, no I don't remember. [LAUGH]  It was like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- it feels like a -- such a long time ago.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But, remember the anthrax and, um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I was more scared of a, um, bio- bio, um, terrorism attack.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, like so many, like, messing -- I don't know, with the air --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- or something, with the water. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That was I was very scared of.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that would -- you know, um, we couldn't probably stop it.  You know, they could sneak in that way.
R:  Yeah, that's what I figured and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I figured this was something I couldn't really escape.  'Cause I wasn't too worried about [LIPSMACK] like attack -- 'cause back then I was in Chicago --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I just wasn't very -- I don't know, worried about somebody, you know, like, trying to bomb Chicago or something.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, something like this, like somebody poisoning the water or --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] -- so I was --
L:  [NOISE] But you wouldn't even know it, you know, until it was too late. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah exactly.
L:  [NOISE] You couldn't --
R:  That's what I was, ah, scared of.  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And then I went to -- I frequently, ah, flew to New York.  Like, after the, um -- 'cause in that time of the attacks --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- I had to go to New York like every, like, six weeks or so, um --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
R:  -- for -- yeah, for a couple of days.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And, you know, I still like -- I still flew.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  And, um, I remember that the second or third time when I was in New York, um, I got a horrible cold there but I get colds easily --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and I got a horrible cold there.  And, yeah, I was scared then that I would have anthrax, but then --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just -- it made me freak out a little bit. 
L:  [NOISE] Mm.  Yeah.  But -- but, you know, you have to be careful, but then, you know, you -- you -- I guess you can't be too careful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] You have to just live your life.  You can't, you know, lock yourself in your house. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  Yeah, that's why now I'm not -- I'm not -- now that we're talking about it, it kind of like --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- comes back to my memory a little bit.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, ah, before that I was almost --
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
R:  -- not forgetting it, but you know, I put it like in the chapter history, so --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- um, but yeah I -- I think hopefully, you know, it's over and it's not gonna keep, you know -- something like this is not going to happen any time soon and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  It's --
