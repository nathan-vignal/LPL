L:  Hi, this Javier.
R:  Hi, this Faith.  How are you?
L:  Good, Faith.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Okay, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] so, have you made any changes since September two thousand one?
R:  Well, basically I've moved and I've, ah, changed employment.
L:  Okay.
R:  I've been kind of doing a lot of soul searching with what I really want to do with the rest of my life.  So I've been kind of doing a lot of home based work and I've done a legal secretarial --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I was rea- really ready for a change.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Um, I was planning on starting -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this new job with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being a pet groomer, but that, um, was delayed.  So right now I'm, ah, basically doing, ah, customer service and telemarketing at home right now until, um, something else comes along.  How 'bout yourself?
L:  [NOISE] Wer- were you in New York?
R:  Ah, no.  I -- I was born in New York but I was, ah -- I'm living [NOISE] in Florida now.
L:  I see, [NOISE] okay.  Ah, I actually -- yeah, I was in New York.  I, um -- [MN] and I moved.  I don't know if it's necessarily as a result of, um, what happened in September.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I moved to Philadelphia, um, to go to school.
R:  Right.
L:  And I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in part I made my -- my decision [NOISE] not to go to school in New York was fueled in part by I think a lot of changes, not only what happened in September, um, but just change in the economy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and work.  But I didn't feel like it was, ah, necessary for me to stay --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in New York and that I could actually, you know, manage to go somewhere else and leave friends and family behind for a few years.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  I lived in Manhattan for four years in the eighties.  Um, I went to Syracuse University, so I moved to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I was nineteen I moved to New York and my mom was orig- originally from Brooklyn and my father from the Bronx.  And my mom passed away about four years ago, but she said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "I'll ta- teach you all about Man- -- about Manhattan and then I'm going back to your dad.  I'll stay with you for two weeks".  I said, "Okay".  So she taught me about the subways and things like that.  I love New York.  I love the -- the pace of New York, what p- -- what New York could offer.  I liked seeing the celebrities down the street, the restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the nightlife.  At that point I was young and I had never married.  It was just a -- I was brought up in a small town --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so this is a whole new --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- world for me.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I wasn't down there during, um, September eleventh.  I moved down -- I moved from New York to Florida in nineteen eighty six.  I lived in Manhattan for four years in Regal Park, Queens, for four years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But when I got pregnant and I was having children I said I don't 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- want to raise my kids in this kind of environment.  I saw how fast the kids were growing up and I think it was a really good decision.
L:  Right.  No, it is, it's not an easy thing to raise a family in New York, not only because of --
R:  It's not.
L:  -- money but --
R:  And a friend of mine was a m- -- a friend of mine was a musician and he was killed and -- ah, when he was twenty one years old.  He was -- he was a pianist and he --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- was practicing down in some bad neighbourhood and was coming home with -- on the subways and some guys attacked him and stabbed him to death and threw him on the railroad tracks and I -- and he was only twenty one years old, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And I was, like, twenty.  So it was -- you know, that was a real shock to my system.  Um, w- -- have -- has -- in your opinion has New York changed since, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, how long were you in -- in -- were you living in Manhattan itself?
L:  Ah, yeah, I was.  I was in Manhattan since -- for about, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at that point five years.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um --
R:  What part of New York?  What part of [inaudible] what part of Manhattan?
L:  I was downtown actually.  I lived in the east, ah --
R:  The Greenwich Village?
L:  -- east village.  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and, you know, I mean, it did change.  Ah, I think -- like I said, I think it's coupled with the fact that the markets were kind of down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for a part of the year already and things had, you know -- the two things together kind of -- I think if people were, for example -- I mean, I think I know a lot of people who have left first of all --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- I've got a couple of friends --
R:  Did you know anybody in the World Trade Centre?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I didn't know anyone directly.  I have a couple of, ah, friends who have coworkers who have lo- -- who lost family members there.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but no one I knew directly, ah, fortunately.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, even though I was very close, um, to the actual accident the day that it happened by sort of n- not intentionally.  Um, I'm never in that part of town --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but was returning a vehicle, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and was getting onto the, ah -- returning a rental vehicle and was getting on to the, ah, Harlem tunnel --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, very early in the morning to drive over to Newark airport and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as I was crossing a large intersection it all began to happen at --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- that point.  It was a very strange, um --
R:  Terrible.
L:  -- experience.
R:  Awful.
L:  But, I mean, I would say that the city has changed.  I think people -- I --
R:  Are people trusting less than they -- I mean, it used to be -- I mean, New Yorkers are the kind of people that say what they feel, you -- they chuck right in your face.  You -- you may be all intimidated by that if you're not a New Yorker, but then you have to respect that too, because you always know where you stand.  They don't talk behind your back, they tell you [LAUGH] -- tell you whether --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you would like to hear it or not exactly what they feel.  Did you -- did you feel that they trusted less after nine eleven?
L:  Well, I mean, immediately after there was a sort of n- -- softening of people, if you can call it that.  People became nicer. [COUGH]
R:  Was that temporary?
L:  It was temporary.  I mean, I think it, you know, probably didn't last about a month.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think people just kind of, you know, were very introspective and e- -- just mourning and hurting from what had happened.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I don't think it was disingenuous.  I think that it was just a very, you know, natural reaction to that kind of tragedy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but I think that people, like you said earlier, began to reevaluate their lives and what they were doing.  And I think in a place like New York where it's so fast and it's easy to get involved in, let's say, some of the more materialistic things in life.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, even if you do have a family.  But it's -- it's a lot about the money and where you are and what you want to do and where you want to be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think a lot of people may have sort of taken stock of their lives at that point and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- decided that if there was something they wanted to do or, you know, they -- they reevaluated their decisions and maybe --
R:  Right.
L:  -- realized that I -- you know, I wouldn't mind moving.  And like I said, coupled with other things that were going on, many people kind of made the decision to leave.  Um, not entirely I would say for fear of an -- of a future attack, but because I think they -- [LIPSMACK] they realized that maybe there were other things that they hadn't given themselves a chance to do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and now is a -- as good a chance as any to do it seeing as, you know, real estate was not good --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and people weren't making money.
R:  And the mar- -- stock market was doing awful, it still is.
L:  Right.  And there was a panic throughout the city.
R:  Right.
L:  So I think in that sense things have changed.  Um, there was also, you know, incidentally there was the change in mayorship.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So we went from one administration to another --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and with that has come --
R:  And -- and, you know, I wa- -- I was doing a lot of transcription work and one thing was that, ah, Guiliani really didn't do -- he didn't -- he wasn't -- they made him out to be this big hero.
L:  [COUGH] Right.
R:  But from the inside track that I've been hearing and I've been reading and I've been transcribing, um, he took a lot more credit that he actually deserved.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There was so- some other people, um, that were never even recognized but Guiliani took all the credit.
L:  Right, that doesn't surprise me I guess, seeing as it was the end of his administration and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it was such a sort of shocking experience --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you kind of just relinquish to, you know -- nobody really wants to at that point object --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to anybody's -- you know, if he's doing something, no one's going to say, "Well, actually ..." [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Right.  And then there was O'Re- O'- O'Reilly is it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, the, um -- the columnist on the -- the -- his talk show.  They were trying to make it seem that the celebrities were, like, you know, ah, doing it for their own benefit and where did all the money go for the raising to the families.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  I don't even know what ever happened.  D- did they get -- settle?  Did, ah, every family finally get their money?
L:  I don't know exactly --
R:  Are they still waiting?
L:  -- how it worked with the -- I mean, there's the -- the sort of -- there's the -- the fund that's set up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, by the federal government that allows people instead of -- basically you sign up, um, and you're entitled to a certain amount of money if you promise not to sue the airlines or -- or other --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- places.  Um, it's meant to avoid going through the --
R:  Litigation.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  I'd like to read that contract. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's actually rather --
R:  I'm sure -- I'm sure there's some juicy things in there.
L:  It's rather interesting.  I actually had to study it for a class.  I'm in law school now and I --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  -- had to study it for a class.
R:  Okay, good for you.  Great.
L:  Thank you.  Um, and, you know, it's got its -- it's got its good -- good -- its -- its virtues to the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- extent that it does really cut down on time to some extent.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but it's actually somewhat problematic, because it basically gives the manager of the fund pretty much all the power to make the decision as to --
R:  Right.
L:  who's going to get how much money. [MN]
R:  And how much of that money's actually being put into their pockets?
L:  Well, all of it will in the extent that you don't need a lawyer necessarily to go through this and --
R:  But as far -- you know, as far as, like, you know, the people heading all these funds.  How much -- I mean, are they doing this -- is a hundred percent going to families or is it, like, eighty percent and twenty percent is being distributed on the people who are in the Salvation Army and in all the United Ways --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  -- and things, you know what I'm saying?
L:  -- it's purely for the families.  I mean, to the point that it actually becomes kind of difficult to prove --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that because since it's only going to people who suffered directly, either they lost, you know, it's -- it's either a husband or a wife, or children --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or parents.  But it also excludes partners of same sex relationships --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, if, you know --
R:  Which -- which is the best baloney.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- because if -- if you're gay and you lost a loved one in -- it shouldn't have anything to do with h- homosexuality --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- heterosexuality.
L:  Right, of course.
R:  If you -- if you lost somebody who lo- -- who -- who you loved, I don't care, you know, I've been friends with people who are -- I'm actually -- a couple of my room mates are gay right now.  The funniest, greatest guys I've ever met in my life.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I'm friends with black people, I'm friends -- and my children were raised that way.  Their father's p- pretty much nonexistent.  Even though he's physically around he's not really involved in their lives.  But my kids are friends with everybody.  If you're nice you're nice, if you're lousy you're lousy.  It has nothing to do with race --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- creed, color or anything el- -- or anything else like that.
L:  Right, right, of course. [NOISE]
R:  You know?  But why should they be left out --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they were living together or they loved each other, or maybe it was a gay brother --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who had p- passed away.  Why shouldn't the family -- i- it shouldn't matter what their sexual orientation is.  It should be that they should be compensated because they were an employee of that build
