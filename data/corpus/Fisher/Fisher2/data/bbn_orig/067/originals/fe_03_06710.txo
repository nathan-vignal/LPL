R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Janette.
L:  Hi, I'm Linda. 
R:  Hi. 
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  North Carolina?  Well, I'm in Texas.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Health and --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- fitness.  Huh?
R:  A lone star state.
L:  Oh, that's right.   Health and fitness.  Well, you know, I probably should do more of that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- exercise and stuff. 
R:  Me too. 
L:  But a lot of my -- ah, do you have Curves up there?
R:  Yes, we do.  And, you know, I was going but, um, I sprained my ankle and I had to quit for a while, but I'm going to start going back.
L:  Well, it -- it -- it's gotten to be the big rage down here and a lot of -- ah, people at the office are -- have started to join and I've been having shoulder problems and I thought, "I can't even raise my arm above my head" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I said, "I think I'm going to wait until I get this, you know, fixed".  But they've really toned up quite a bit.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it -- it's really good, because my first month there, I know I lost two inches in my hips.
L:  Oh, well, that's wonderful.
R:  And, um, I'm pretty big, I mean, I'm a big person and, um, [LAUGH] I'm also on a -- a we- weight, um, a diet thing and, like, Weight Watchers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but [MN] I do like to go Curves.  I mean, it's only thirty minutes a day and we change stations every thirty seconds.
L:  See, and I think that's what I would like, because I think I would get bored just doing the same thing.  And I like the idea of thirty minutes, in and out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know. 
R:  And it's, like, I mean, you, um, you start out maybe with aerobics and then hydraulics, then aerobics, hydraulics, all the way around, so and then you stretch afterwards.
L:  Oh.
R:  After you -- not -- not before, but afterwards, and I like that because otherwise I'd probably end up with trolley horses all the time. 
L:  Well, I'm sure I probably would. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I probably would.  How do you like Weight Watchers?
R:  Weight Watchers is pretty good.  I was on it, um, before and I lost forty pounds in three months.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um --
L:  That's pretty good. My daughter is on it -- ha- has just started and, ah, she -- she's doing pretty good, she's struggling with the water part. 
R:  Yeah, well, I -- I had no problem with water, mine was the fruits and vegetables. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Not my favorite thing either.
R:  [LAUGH] I have to buy a lot of these, um, canned peas and green beans and things like that, and 'course [MN] I'm not much of a vegetable [inaudible] -- either --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I'll eat -- I love bananas --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'll eat bananas and apples and oranges and stuff, but [MN] I can't eat raw vegetables because I have a colon problem. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh, so see, one thing leads to another, doesn't it, yeah?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's me, you know.  Well, I've never really been a healthy eater, you know, I by myself, and since, you know, the kids are grown and gone and stuff, and so, you know, I figure why cook for just me?  So, you know, I'm real bad about going out, you know, with the girls at lunch and eating a sandwich or a burger or something and then coming home and usually do a Weight Watchers or Lean Cuisine or something like that for dinner.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, if I do cook, I try to cook, you know, like, a big batch of spaghetti and then freeze a bunch, so, you know, I can heat it up at night.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And that type of thing.  So --
R:  But --
L:  -- how did you -- how did you find out about this Fisher Group thing?
R:  Well, one of my, um, good friends in Massachusetts sent me a link --
L:  I see.
R:  -- and I'm always doing surveys and stuff so she thought I might be interested in [LAUGH] --
L:  So you signed up.  See, I belong to a refunding group and a lot of the gals on there were talking about it.
R:  Mm. 
L:  So, I thought that was kinda neat, but I guess we need to talk about fitness which --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I -- I -- I'm not too, you know, I'm not o- -- I'm a little bit overweight, you know, I'm pretty active, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I teach and so that kinda keeps me -- keeps me moving, you know.  I hate to think of what I might be like if -- if I didn't have all of the up and down, you know, with the kids and stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Well, I like to dance too.  And my friend and I -- well, my guy friend, [LAUGH] he, um -- we go -- we try and go out dancing at least once a month, if --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- not more.
L:  -- sounds like fun.  See, I wish I had somebody to dance with --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause I like to dance, but, you know --
R:  Well, I'm not much of a dancer, but he is.
L:  Well, I didn't say I was good. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, he's -- my mama, now she's a good dancer, but I mean, she taught me what I know and [LAUGH] I just [MN] [LIPSMACK] I'm not really the kinda person, ah, I mean I'll walk, but I can't walk very far for long --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that's one problem I have because my doctors want me to walk and they want me to exercise, and I've got one of those Tony Little machines, the glider --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the Gazelle[?] glider.
L:  You like that?
R:  Yeah, it's pretty good.  I mean, um, it takes off the weight but it takes a lot longer than Curves does [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, and see, I'm just afraid, [COUGH] you know, that I'd get one of those machines and I'd start off all gung ho, you know, 'cause I've bought tapes, and walking tape and some yoga tapes type thing, you know, I'll do them for about a week or so and then I get --
R:  That's me.
L:  -- get side tracked watching television or reading a book or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, just "No, I just don't think I wanna do that today", you know.  And --
R:  Well, at Curves, um, what I like about it is it's all women.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, there's no men in there to put you down and, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  With women, I mean, we have a slower metabolism than the men do.
L:  Right, that's true.  That's true.
R:  And men can burn off stuff faster than a woman can and, I mean, yeah, I go in there and they help you out.  I mean, if there's a certain thing you can't do, they'll work with you to do something else. 
L:  Do they have a diet program --
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  -- with them?
R:  It's sort of like, um, the Atkins Program.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, I couldn't do the Atkins 'cause I'm diabetic.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I have to have, um, certain things, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that mostly eating meats and stuff, which I love meat --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but --
L:  Yeah, I like the potatoes and bread that go with them though.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  See, that -- that's my problem --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, I mean, I eat -- I eat fairly healthy, you know, it's just that, you know, my favorites tend to be starches.
R:  Yeah, that's like my friend, she -- she loves starches.  She won't quit eating them.
L:  Right, and, you know, there is, you know, as I'm getting older, my metabolism is slowing down and, you know, where I used to be fairly thin, now I'm starting to, you know, the middle aged spread [COUGH].
R:  Yep.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, you know, I keep thinking, "Yeah, well, you know, I kinda deserved it".  But, you know, I don't want it -- I don't want it to get out of hand because I've -- I'm afraid that once I let it get out of hand, than I really will have my work cut out for me.  That's why I thought, well, maybe since I'm starting to sag, maybe I should start doing something about it, you know, with the other girls, but 'til I can get this rotator cup fixed, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, where I can lift my arm above my head, I just don't think I'd be much -- much use doing anything.
R:  Yeah, what -- in Curves, I mean, when I get up there, they'll have you, like, run in place and then they'll have you do a, um -- it's not really -- you're not lifting anything heavy, I mean, it's mostly just pushing and pulling --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pushing and pulling.  It -- it's not really -- and I can do that.  I mean, if I went to a regular gym I'd have to do reps and stuff, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with weights and it's nothing like that.
L:  Yeah, well, see, I -- I -- I'm -- I'm not even interested in doing anything like that, you know --
R:  Me either.
L:  -- but Curves just kinda seemed, you know, kind of middle of the line, [LAUGH] you know, type thing, you know, just to kind of get me active.
R:  Yeah, and it's only three days a week.  
L:  Yeah, and I, you know, I think, you know, you can do anything for three days a week.  And, you know, if you're going to see results -- this one gal, she, ah, is about my age and, you know, like, her lo- -- upper arms were starting to get a little flabby, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a little flabby around the back, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the little pooch around the bra and stuff and, you know, she's been going for about three week now, she says -- [MN] she says, "I can even s- -- I can see a difference", she says, "I really don't notice a weight difference" but she says, "I see a difference in my body".
R:  Yeah, I could feel a difference.  When I was losing -- I was losing in the hips but not anywhere else, so my -- the instructor, she was just like, "Well, well, what are we doing here?  Are we going down instead of up, or ...?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I -- I don't know, I had lost two inches in my hips and, um, they encouraging me -- if you end up someone -- they'll give you a tee shirt or something or they'll give you a reward, you know, for each, like, if you bring in another person --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- they'll give you a reward of some kind and, um, at least the one here does. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I know --
L:  I --
R:  -- that for a fact.   
L:  I think they were talking about something, you kinda half -- half hear these conversations, [LAUGH] you know, over -- over lunch as we're stuffing our face, you know [inaudible] --
R:  One of the other things that you might be interested in is Curves has a book out.
L:  Mm.
R:  And it's called Curves.  I don't know if there's a Sam's Club near you?
L:  Yeah, pretty close.
R:  Okay, well, I know they have it.  
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  It's, ah, Curves, C.U.R.V.E.S.  And Curves for Women and, ah, it tells you all about their plan and their exercising and everything.  
L:  Oh, well, that sounds --
R:  And it's by Michael Hathen[?] or Michael Haven.
L:  Okay, so he must be the guy that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- discovered the plan.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I keep thinking, you know, wow, what a money maker, you know, if it's going so great guns, it's just -- I don't know how long it's been down here, but, you know, the people around my school system have just now --
R: [LAUGH] 
L:  -- discovered it and, ah, it's in a pretty big town.  There's, like, three or four, you know, in Fort- -- I teach out at Fort Worth, but I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- don't live in Fort Worth, I live outside of the, ah, metroplex.  You know, and in the small town that I'm in, we don't have one, you know, and I'm thinking, "Wow, maybe this might be a money maker.  Not only can I lose weight and do the exercises, maybe I should open up a franchise". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- looking forward to retirement here, you know. [COUGH] I thought, "Well, that could be something that, you know, could be beneficial to everybody".  
R:  Well, my endocrinologist recommends it.  He told me -- he says, "I know you're doing a Weight Watchers thing", he says, "I agree with that", he said, "And I agree with this Curves", he says, "I like this idea" --
L:  Well --
R:  -- 'cause I'm getting a little bit of both.  I'm getting exercise in and I'm getting nutrition at the same time. 
L:  Right, and --
R:  And he's like --
L:  -- that -- and I think overall that's what's important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  I tried their plan but, you know, like I said, it was almost like the Atkins Plan, and --
