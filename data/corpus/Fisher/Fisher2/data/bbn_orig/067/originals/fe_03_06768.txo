R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hello.
L:  My name is Julie and I'm in Wisconsin.
R:  Hello, this is Bev and I'm in Georgia.
L:  Well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's nice.  Nice to hear from you.  So, you're probably -- you're -- you know, you're closer to New York and all so how did everything affect you?
R:  Okay, just a minute.  Wait just a minute.  Boo, what was this researching about?  Was it nine eleven?  Oh, okay.  My husband was on the phone first [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so I think --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I had to see about the discussion with him. [LAUGH]  Okay, what did they want us to say ma'am?
L:  Well, they just wanted to know how nine eleven affected your life, any changes or anything.
R:  Okay, well for me personally, I was depressed.  I mean for a long time.  Really down, you know?  And plus I was more, um, aware of my surroundings when I went places, you know?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I caught myself just -- you know, just looking, just -- you know, and I noticed things that I've never noticed before.  Especially when I was standing in hotels or something, and I was -- I was on the look out.  And so it was just like I was on edge.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, um, w- -- up here in Wisconsin, you know, I'm out in the boonies so we don't, you know, there isn't a lot around, but --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- like when the towers got hit, I just sat there and balled.  I had just been out there about three years before that --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I've seen the towers and then two years before, um -- well, it actually was the next year, then I had done, um, with one of my high school students and we had, you know, toured New -- um, Washington DC and the Pentagon and all, and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- it just -- it, you know, whacked -- when you see something like that and then you see it destroyed, it just -- it really gets to you.  Have -- had you ever seen either place?
R:  [NOISE] Have I ever seen what?
L:  Had you ever seen either place, the towers or --
R:  No.  
L:  -- the Pentagon?
R:  [NOISE] Uh-uh.  No, not -- you know, just on TV or pictures or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Not live or anything.  I've never been to New York.
L:  Yeah.  I happened to go with, um, some foreign ed students.  We took a trip out east and, you know, it just -- it really hits you, you know, after you've seen these places and then, you know, it's really hard to imagine just how big the World Trade Towers were --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, on TV.  I mean, they were just --
R:  I know it.
L:  [NOISE] -- and to think that they came down so fast that -- but, yeah, otherwise, um, as far as travelling, um, it didn't -- y- -- I'm -- it didn't really affect me.  I mean, I didn't let it bother me.  Like, well this was in September and my husband and I had planned on a twenty fifth wedding anniversary in Cancun for in January, and, um, [LIPSMACK] we didn't change our plans.  You know, my --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- aunts and all said you know, "Well, aren't you afraid you know on the plane and all?"  And I said, "No you know you can't live your life in fear.  You've got to you know go on".  So --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  But I kind of -- the only changes I made, you know, I kind of, ah, stayed away from the high profile places, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And -- but other than that, you know, life went on as usual.  But like I said I was just more aware of my surroundings, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- than I'd, you know, usually am, you know.  But I was -- I noticed everything that I thought may not be quite right or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- unusual or something.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's -- I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] But, you know -- but right now I -- I've gotten -- I think I've gotten a little complacent where I don't notice these things, and I think I should be a -- you know, aware all the time 'cause you know that's what -- when something happens is when you become complacent and then boom, you know?
L:  Yeah, you know, with, um, you know, a -- Al Qaeda's been, you know, basically quiet in this country since --
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE]
L:  -- nine eleven, you know.  It's like you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] But -- so like I said, one thing fortunate is we're out here in the boon docks, I mean, [NOISE] we're about -- oh, about a hundred and fifty miles east of the twin cities in Minnesota.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and, um, you know, I'm about two hundred miles north of Milwaukee.  So we're just kind of, you know -- and it's nice being out in the boon docks at this time. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, that's [LAUGH] -- that's the way we are.  We're about approximately seventy five miles north east of Atlanta --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- in, um, Cleveland, Georgia. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] And, ah, w- -- I always say that we're famous for the cabbage patch kids. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But, um, [SIGH] um, well, like, I'm on a school board and the first year our foreign language club had planned on a European trip.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  And we cancelled that that first year, but now, um, well, November we let the kids go to Europe, um, you know, it's just -- you gotta -- I -- you know, some of these things you just gotta kinda wait and see what happens but --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know, if it's safe to go to Europe or not, and, you know, at that time we -- first year we didn't feel it was, but then --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- like I said this last year we let 'em go and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  You have to live life I guess as usual.  Just be -- just make sure you just, you know -- just be aware like --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] -- you would do anything else, you know.  'Cause crime is so prevalent it's best to be aware anyway.
L:  Oh definitely.
R:  [NOISE] You know, 'cause it's getting bad.  Well, if you don't -- well -- well, right now we can still go to bed, you know, with the doors unlocked and windows open, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- but I don't know how long it will be [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] -- but, you know, right now nobody locks their doors or anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It's that small.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. 
L:  I said we come in at night and go to look for our car keys the next day and gee we left them in the vehicle overnight, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] That's the way it is here, you know?
L:  That's right.  But, no I would imagine that sh- -- you must have quite a few minorities around --
R:  [NOISE] Oh --
L:  -- in your part of the country?
R:  [NOISE] A few.
L:  A few, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  See we don't -- we don't really have, you know, many up here.  It's basically a German Polish descent up here and --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, but, um, I just wondered, you know, those that -- well, like, for instance, you know, your middle eastern.  Those that work with them on a daily basis, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we have some.
L:  -- I always just thought -- you know, how does -- you know, how does it affect their relationship?  You know, I mean are they a little bit more wary of each other or --
R:  [NOISE] Well, [several inaudible words] some people that -- that are still ignorant, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] They look at them just because they look a certain way, they assume that everybody is from Iraq.  You -- [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- or whatever, you know?  And, um, so, but other than that, you know, for people that had any type of intelligence they would know, 'cause, you know, like these people are from India, you know, where -- if they look like 'em, you know, they could well pick on them and they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- would just -- they'd just show they're ignorant.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] You know, so I didn't treat anybody, you know, any different before as I did now.  Because --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] -- this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It's the people, you know, it's the -- the person, you know?  It's not the country.  It's the people that are in the countries.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause we've had, you know, terrorist here that've done the --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- multiple damage.
L:  Yeah.  Well, look at Timothy McVeigh.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah, that's for sure.
R:  [NOISE] That was horrid.  That was all those kids.
L:  Yes, exactly.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  Yeah, that was sad.  Yeah, so -- so what do you think about 'em putting up, um, this planned memorial that they've got for the World Trade Centre?  Have you seen any of the plans for that?
R:  [NOISE] Um, once.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Once when they -- I think they had one that they finally agreed on putting up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, something I can't remember exactly what it looked like.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But, um --
L:  'Cause I just wondered too, because they're planning on putting up something, you know, that's even taller than what the Trade towers had been in.
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  Ah, yeah I -- I, you know, don't know how I feel about that.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] No, me either.
L:  -- on one hand it's like you want to, you know, put your thumb at 'em and say, "Ha ha, you know, we're going to build that better than ever", but --
R:  [NOISE] I wouldn't want to rent there.
L:  -- God, I don't know if I'd want to work on the top --
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  -- floor. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Uh-uh.  
L:  You know?
R:  [NOISE] Definitely, no.  
L:  Yeah, so I don't know.  I just don't -- I don't know.
R:  [NOISE] I definitely wouldn't want to work up there.
L:  No, exactly.  Exactly.  Mm.  I'll say one thing that is a shame is -- well, like, one of my sister in laws was just out from New York here in April.  And, like, when I was out there with the kids, um, we got to climb up, you know, to the top of the Statue of Liberty and all.  
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And now they can't even get to the base of it.
R:  [NOISE] Ooh.
L:  You can go -- you can go to Liberty Island but you can just walk around --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- like there's one part section.  I mean, you can't even go in the base where the original, um, torch is or, you know, climb up to the top and, you know, it -- that's just really too bad that we've got all of this historical stuff and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that they can't enjoy it a hundred percent.  So --
R:  [NOISE] Mm.  And I love to visit places like that.  Any historical places I love it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] You know, I'm just all into it.  You know, my mind just [LAUGH] goes back --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, and I can just see, you know, um --
L:  Yeah.
