L:  -- gets the tri salaries, like I don't -- Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Benny.
L:  Hi, I'm Gina.  Where --
R:  Hi, Gina.
L:  -- are you from?
R:  I'm from Provo.
L:  From where?
R:  Provo, Utah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Are you --
R:  And you?
L:  I'm from the -- I live in Minnesota.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I'm actually from Alabama.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  Are you --
R:  Well, I'm actually from Namibia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.  Are you a student in Utah?
R:  Yeah, Brigham Young University.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah, I go to Carlton.  It's like a small school.
R:  Yeah?
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Cool.
L:  I don't really know anything about [LAUGH] sports strikes, I mean --
R:  I have no idea, like, I didn't -- I -- I wasn't even aware that they're having strikes in sports.
L:  Yeah, I -- like, I know that they do sometimes just 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like -- like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just holding out for more money --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um, I don't know.  I mean they do get really ridiculous salaries. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- honestly, that's what I think.  Um, I don't know, I -- I think that sometimes we get -- we mistake, like, the sport, you know, the value of the sport as wh -- to, um, the value of the player I think sometimes, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know that some players are honestly worth the money that they go on strikes for, you know?
L:  Yeah, well, I mean --
R:  But --
L:  -- they do, like, put themselves at a lot of risk.  I mean, like -- like, physical.
R:  Ph- physical risks, I know.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  But I'm sh- -- but I'm like, you know what?  There's a factory worker that puts himself in just as much danger, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and pays, like -- gets paid so little -- so much more less than he -- this player does.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's like -- it's hard.  It's like what defines -- is it because we love the sport or is we lo- -- because we love the player that we pay him so much?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's just confusing.  But I am -- I'm for the --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- if I was a sportsperson, you know, if I was an athlete, I would want as much money as I could get, you know --
L:  Oh, hell yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- because -- and I think it's different when you do the sport.  When do a sport you feel like -- you know, it's like, "No -- no way, I'm putting like -- I'm putting my all into this, I need more money than that" you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  But at the same time it's like a factory worker out there, you know, lifting heavy duty stuff and, you know, working under so much stress and just a danger every day but he gets, like, paid minimum wages, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  I don't see w- what is the difference, you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I don't know, I guess maybe you w- -- you -- well, you watch the sport and then you don't watch the factory worker.
L:  Well, I think a lot of what it is, is what you said, it's just, like, um, that we love the player not the sport.  I mean, a lot of players who, like, just because they're, like -- I mean, this is kind of bad to say, but just because they're, like, good looking or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, they're not even that good at the sport.
R:  That's true.
L:  Like, they'll get a whole bunch more money -- a whole bunch more, like, love from the public or whatever just because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Anna Kournikova [LAUGH] --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- for example. [LAUGH]
R:  I think, yeah.  I probably think so.  I think sports are like, you know, like per -- they become personalities whereas like -- you know, forget -- forget what I do, you know, like pay me for who I am.  It's like I'll be on your maz- magazine cover too, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  It's like it's just taking on a whole new level.
L:  Mm.
R:  But [NOISE] I don't know how I feel about it.  I think they p- -- get so much money sometimes.
L:  Right.
R:  At the same time I feel like it's, you know, like they should get that much money.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  So --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Well, it's like if people are willing to pay them that much money then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, maybe -- I mean, I don't -- you know, then why not give them --
R:  Do you think we should devalue our culture, you know, that pay so much to people that just do something, you know?  Get -- I don't know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you think?
L:  Um, I don't know if we should but I feel like that's what we're becoming.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Well, I don't know.  It's -- it's hard.  I don't know, because -- I don't know -- I don't know if it's -- it's okay, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Sometimes I feel it's okay but sometimes I don't.
L:  Right.
R:  But, like, you know, you have kids growing up and they have, like, these sports personalities as their role models, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and they're going to be -- they want to be just like them and so, like, just for the money and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how they how they look like, you know, and --
L:  It --
R:  -- publicity they get.  Not necessarily the sports they play.
L:  Oh, are sports really big in Namibia?
R:  Ah, soccer.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's like -- and the thing is, like, it -- like, mainly in Africa but the person isn't as big as the sport is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's how it is really like.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they get paid tons of money but they're more -- men are like, you know, the -- they're so much bigger than, like, you know the important of the sport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like more of the team kind of thing.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know, it's probably going to grow to be like that, like it is here, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where you have, like, sports personalities but --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- it's m- --
L:  -- that's like, um [COUGH] like in Europe and stuff, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the directors of movies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get a lot more publicity than like the actors.
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  But here it's just all about the actors and stuff, like it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, America's very odd. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This is right --
L:  We're very individualized, it's not --
R:  You've -- yeah.
L:  -- so much of a group.
R:  Yeah, I think that's -- that's true.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, it's -- yeah, I think -- and ba- back home when they would go on strikes --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, it's like it's such a -- it's, um [LIPSMACK] you taking such a big chance, you know?  Like --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, while here it's like -- it's more like they have this attitude about the money.  You know, it's like whoa -- it's like --
L:  Wh- --
R:  -- this is --
L:  And the thing --
R:  -- I deserve this --
L:  -- if you think too, like --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- athletes are kind of expendable, you know, like --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's true. 
L:  But for some reason nobody considers that.  Like [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's always a big crisis if like, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Mm.
L:  I don't really know.
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  Mm.  These topics , like, sometimes are hard to talk about for a long time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because [LAUGH] like the other day we had a -- I had to talk to this guy about, like, if we exercise a lot.
R:  Yeah?
L:  And, like, neither of us did and so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we pretty much had nothing to [LAUGH] talk about, you know?  Like, that was just weird.  So --
R:  Do you watch sports?
L:  Um, when I was little I was a big baseball fan.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Um, I'm from -- well, I'm from Alabama so our team was the Braves -- Atlanta Braves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and -- yeah, I was a huge fan and then we won the World Series and then we kind of, like, went down ever since then. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And, I don't know, like, all the old players that I liked left --
R:  Are gone.
L:  -- or they retired --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- they were traded off or s- -- you know, and now I don't really --
R:  Did --
L:  -- know any of the players, so --
R:  -- did any of them ever go on strikes?
L:  Um, no.  But there is one player who is -- his name is David Justice.  He's really famous.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but anyway he, um, like, criticized the fans and said that the fans didn't support him and stuff, and so after that, like, nobody really liked him.
R:  Ouch.
L:  And so, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then y- -- we also had John Rocker.  Like, I don't know if you heard, like, he, um, when we went to the World Series against the Mets --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- oh, not the Mets, the Yankees, he was talking about, like, how New Yorkers are full of, like, gay people and, like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- pregnant teenage wor- -- teenagers, and punks with pink hair so that -- anyway, like, he got in big trouble from those statements and now he plays in New York.  He plays for the Mets now.
R:  Are you serious? [LAUGH]
L:  Which is kind of funny, yeah.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  -- man.
L:  What took you to Brigham Young?
R:  Oh, my goodness.  I'm Mormon --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, like -- you know, it's, like -- I went to find out.  You know, it was -- it was a cheap seat.  This is the cheaper school.  Anyway I could, like --
L:  It's a good school though.
R:  -- y- --  Oh, it's -- it's an excellent school and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was cheaper than any other col- -- university I could ever get into --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like in the States --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  So, yeah.  I came here.
L:  Is that close to Salt Lakes?
R:  Yeah, very.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's like --
L:  My sister's boyfriend, um, lives in [NOISE] Salt Lake City.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where's your sister at?
L:  Um, well now -- she goes to Stanford --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- in California.  So it's not really that far.  Like, they can still -- they drive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- yeah, it's not that far.
L:  So --
R:  It's about -- yeah, wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Like, I -- I haven't been to California yet.  I want to go to California though.
L:  Ah, how long have you -- what year are you?
R:  I'm a junior.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you play sports? [LAUGH]
R:  I play basketball a lot.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I love --
L:  Are you tall?
R:  -- basketball.  Ah?
L:  Are you tall?
R:  No, I'm like five three.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so it's so much harder here because everyone is so tall.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Is the religion thing, like, okay with you or ...?
R:  Yeah, it's okay.  Like, you -- you know, it's like overemphasized a lot sometimes here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but it's -- you know, it's like something I -- I think I've learned to accept if I'm -- if I want to be here, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.  
L:  Mm.
R:  It's annoying sometimes because of their rules, like, come with it -- you know, that -- like the code -- honor code and everything like that, you know, 'cause --
L:  Like what?
R:  The honor code.  
L:  What is that?  Oh, the honor code, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm sorry I thought you -- I don't know what [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH] No, yeah.  So you -- you get into trouble -- you end up getting into trouble, like, just because a guy came into your room or something, you know?  It's like --
L:  Oh, that's stupid.
R:  I know.  So it's like -- it's really ridiculous.  So if you get the wrong roommate, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they, like, bust you.  It's -- like, you are out.  You must out of school already.
L:  Are there a lot of parties and stuff?
R:  Too boring ones.  They -- like they -- the cops, like, cut them short, like by twelve.
L:  Whoa.
R:  It's like -- I swear, like, nothing goes over one of -- even clubs clo- -- in Salt Lake, they close at one.
L:  Well, okay, yeah.  I have a friend who goes to Brown.  And in Providence they close at two which I think is pretty early.  
R:  That's -- yeah, that's two in all Fridays only.  Like, Saturdays is one o'clock.
L:  Whoa.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] Well, our school, um, like, we're pretty -- I mean, I guess we're kind of considered like a liberal place or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, like --
R:  What's your school's name --
L:  -- every [inaudible] --
R:  -- again?
L:  It's called Carlton College.  It's like a little liberal arts school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it's, um, close to Minneapolis.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, yeah, like -- I don't know, you just hear bad things about places like Brigham Young [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like where is this -- yeah.  But, I mean we're -- we're really rural so they're into a lot of clubs and bars and stuff but --
R:  Wow.  
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, it's, like, ah, not here.  You know, it's only --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, only certain people can survive here I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And all the -- I like it, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  Don't get me wrong I love the environments.  It's cool that you can come to a place where it's like that, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  They have, like, centers like that.  But I just don't think it's right for everyone, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  Mm.  Well, it's good that we don't have so many parties and we can concentrate on our school work. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Are you going to go back to Africa after you graduate?
R:  Yeah.  I want to go back.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  In a year I'm almost done.
L:  Yeah.  What's your ma- --
