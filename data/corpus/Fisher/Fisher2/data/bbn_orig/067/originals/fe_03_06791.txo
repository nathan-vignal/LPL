R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Debbie and I'm from upstate New York.
L:  Hi, my name is Shawna Marie and I am originally from Ohio but I reside in southern USA now.  How are you?
R:  I'm sorry, where did you say you reside?
L:  I- -- I'm in Atlanta Georgia at the southern USA. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  I thought you said out of the USA and I was thinking, "Oh, I didn't realize they took calls out".
L:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm fine.  I don't know how well I can talk about this topic of conversation, other than to say I think they make horrible huge amounts of money and they have no business striking.
L:  Well, I disagree with that.  The amount of money that they make compared to the amount that the franchises make --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is very minimal and those company owners are not risking their, ah -- their bones or their [LAUGH] muscles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- being strained like the players.  And I -- I don't think that they really get what they completely deserve, but the way to eradicate that is to start athle- -- ah, well athletic companies that are owned by the athletes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the only way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to avoid being, ah, paid lower than what you're worth.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, the problem I do have is I don't think enough athletes take responsibility for the position that they have in society.  Um, just, ah, regarding the -- the role that they play and, ah, just dictating how younger children --
R:  Right.
L:  -- act and -- and not that you're supposed to --
R:  As far as --
L:  -- raise other people's --
R:  -- role models, right?
L:  -- kids.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  But I just think that being in a position of privilege you should acknowledge that and act responsibly and just be more discrete [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about your indiscretions as such.  So --
R:  I don't know how to, like, control that whole money thing.  I -- I know what you're saying about the franchise --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- make all the money, they make nothing.  Maybe we have to say, well, which is ridiculous, that the franchises shouldn't make all that money because, like, even just the cost of tickets for families being able to go and everything.  I just think o- okay the -- the -- the franchise makes the money that they make --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the money that these people make -- I mean, they make more than people that save people's lives --
L:  Yes --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- but society dictates that. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Society really --
R:  By going, I know.
L:  -- places the importance on, you know, a nurse versus --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, a basketball player.
R:  Right.
L:  So I don't really fault them for that.  Um --
R:  No, but when they make the money that they make --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] I guess I just think like they have a- -- they should be happy with what they make and not strike for more money.  It would be like me being upset that I only make, say, ten dollars an hour --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but my boss makes -- you know, like the -- by the time everything's done at the end of the year, he's making thirty dollars an hour.
L:  Now, how would you feel if you were making ten dollars an hour and your boss was making a hundred dollars an hour and he really did nothing? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess what you're saying --
L:  Um, but maybe, you know, one month out of the year.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  Basically.
R:  Right.  I mean --
L:  And then --
R:  -- on one hand he owns the company --
L:  -- you had like a sprained ankle and --
R:  -- he started the --
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I -- I mean, your body is being put through so much.  And not that -- I mean, this is what they chose --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of course, but I think when you see, um --
R:  So in the big picture --
L:  -- just the disparity --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of what they're making and what the owners are making.  I think that's why they're upset.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and then when you look at the ticket sales and they know how much people are paying but then they only see a small percentage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- relatively, ah, speaking.  You know, to us it's like, "Hey, be happy". [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  Well, 'cause my husband's --
L:  But --
R:  -- always saying, you know, and he's a guy and he's played sports all through school  --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and everything and, like, he's a -- like he'll say, "God, I can't believe it.  I would do it for free" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, like "I love playing that game, I would do it for free" or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  But when you put it like that -- like if you say, "I make ten, he makes twenty" as far as a boss employee situation --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it doesn't sound like much.  But when you say, um, it -- it's like how nurses will say that they do m- most of the work --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's not a lot of the same that the doctors do.  O- obviously not operations, those kinds of things, but --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and then nurses make what they make.  But [SIGH] I -- I myself I don't know how to get around that or -- i- it's stupid to say maybe they should make less money, the franchises, 'cause obviously everybody or any operation would want to make as much money as they could, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- maybe if they just didn't charge so much even for tickets, and --
L:  Well, it's about really supply and demand.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And as long as people are willing to pay --
R:  Right.
L:  -- those prices -- see, what's happened in Atlanta because the Atlanta Hawks are -- are not such a great basketball team --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have been forced to lower the ticket prices.  But believe me, if they were doing well, those tickets --
R:  Right.
L:  -- would be just as high.
R:  Right.  They only lowered 'em because people don't want to see 'em cause they're not playing well --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- but what people should do is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even if a team plays well, I mean to get around this, just boycott and don't pay those high ticket prices.  But --
L:  Right.  But then that would be up to the consumer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and not the players.  And the players are just reacting to what they see --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- within their franchises.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] You know, and because they're [NOISE] ah -- you know, a lot of people will say, "Well, yes I would play for free", but if you were playing and you saw this going on around you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you wouldn't be as satisfied with the situation.  Because no-one likes to be taken advantage of --
R:  [NOISE] You're right --
L:  -- no matter --
R:  -- when you put it that way. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, for what price. [LAUGH]
R:  Geez, now next time my husband says that I'm just going to say, "Well --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- what if Fred was making [LAUGH] X amount of money and you only made this?"  I know, the whole thing -- not only with things like that but -- it's just so out of control and you just feel so helpless to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even know where to start to get it back down to where it should be.
L:  Yeah.  And it really -- it just has a lot to do with our societal values.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it's really not about the sports or the players --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or how much they make.  It's really about what we place value on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in this society that's so screwed up.  It's just the result of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I don't think it's really a problem.  And how to address the core of the problem, that is the question that needs to be answered. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  Because when you have people that, you know, place more value on, you know, their favorite basketball player versus, you know, the person that's been caring for their family, like a nurse or a doctor --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, when you really look at it --
R:  Or policemen or a fireman.
L:  -- you know, doctors --
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, or firemen, exactly.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, really our healthcare professionals are -- you know, people that are putting their lives on the line, they don't make enough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They really don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for what they do.  And then when you talk about, ah -- people feel like, "Oh, doctors make a lot of money" but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really with the insurance --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and now packers insurance -- oh, it's ridiculous.  I really think that they need to put a cap on that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you have a lot of physicians that are going out of business that were great physicians, but they can't afford to stay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in business.  And, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that -- that's a cap that I think needs to [LAUGH] --
R:  It's the same with --
L:  -- to be set.
R:  -- movie stars and things like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the amount of money --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- they make.
L:  And really, you know, we -- we dictate their salaries, really.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's -- it's not really about the franchises, it's what the public will buy into.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And people just don't buy into, you know, ah, paying nurses or teachers --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- [LAUGH] more money.
R:  Right.
L:  People that stay with these crazy kids for eight hours --
R:  You know why?
L:  -- a day.
R:  I think it's because with teacher -- well, teachers, there's certain things [SIGH] -- they don't look at the choice that they really have, the public, when -- when they -- you know, they have the option to vote for that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tax increase in the budget for teachers and things like that.  For the tickets for other things, whether it be a movie theater or a sporting event, if they want -- and -- and there's no -- yeah, I mean, it's not a vote.  It's like, do you want to see it or don't ya? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And if they pay they're willing to go along with that.  On the tax thing, I mean granted they do get to vote, but it just somehow doesn't seem, mm [LIPSMACK] i- i- it -- it seems because then they know it's -- i- i- it's -- it's going to be coming right out of their pocket if they say yes.  They generally --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- vote no and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things in the school system suffer.
L:  And then people complain about, you know, the, ah -- the, ah, quality or the lack thereof of the curriculum.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's because of all of these cut backs that they're voting against.  You know, and then they complain about the teachers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, not taking the time with their children, but hey, they're not being paid really anything.  Um, and then they spend all of this time with the lesson plans and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they do a lot of hard work and then it's like a slap in the face when people vote against --
R:  I know it is.
L:  -- you know, higher --
R:  I know.
L:  -- salaries.
R:  I mean, I've been lucky.  My kids have always had wonderful, wonderful teachers and I've loved 'em and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and [SIGH] i- it is hard but y- -- and a lot of the people I think too that are in the school system, it seems like they're older or their kids have gr- --
