R:  Huh.
L:  So, we're neighbors.
R:  How -- where are you from?
L:  Uh, I'm from here -- I was born and raised here.
R:  Uh, you was born and raised in LA?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, okay.
L:  Yeah, not too many of us around.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What about you?
R:  Oh, about what?
L:  [MN] Where were you born?
R:  Oh, I was born in, uh, Los Angeles, California.
L:  Oh, both of us?  Okay.
R:  Oh, yeah, I was born Los Angeles, California, now, being a little bit raised in Kansas City, Missouri --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, and I came back out here, spent the rest of my other life out here.
L:  Yes, uh-huh.  So, let's see, the topic is, um, [MN] what -- what's kind of changed in our life since September eleventh?
R:  Yes.
L:  What's changed for you?
R:  Well, actually, you know, mine's, um, ain't nothing changed.  Um, being more alert, you know --
L:  I'm sorry, being -- being more what?
R:  Being more alert.
L:  Alert, okay.
R:  Yes, being more alert of, um, [LIPSMACK] suspicious things, uh, packages and things, you know, maybe keeping my eyes more open wider, you know, to see -- see things clearer now, wh- what can happen now, you know, you never know, things like this can happen.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, so now you gotta be full alert, you know and all.  Now, there's more le- -- you know, more wise now, you know, not wise, I say, more alert.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] You know, so --
L:  Yeah, actually, I -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I work in Westwood and, um, [MN] I was driving to work yesterday on Wiltshire --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was just taking me forever, it was bumper to bumper traffic and I'm like, "What is going on?" and I get to Westwood Boulevard and it's like the street's blocked off, there's police, helicopters and, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we were detoured and, um, I got to work, like, thirty minutes late [MN] and then we found out that, um, there was a bomb threat across the street --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- uh, at the bank.  So, um, [SIGH] it was, uh -- it made you stop and think for a minute, people were looking for, like, the emergency exit in case we had to leave --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, I just, you know -- my friends that I work with, they were kind of nervous and, uh, I just said to them, you know, "Every single bomb threat that we've had, you know, nothing's happened". 
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've just been threats, so, um -- and do you know, I'm here talking to you, so, you know, nothing happened. [LAUGH]
R:  But, see, down -- that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what I'm saying, you know, about how you were just saying it was just threats --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- okay, now, wh- what's kind of bothering me now, is because, you know, these threats, you know, can we take -- we have to take these threats seriously though.
L:  Right.  That's why they -- they had to make sure.
R:  My thought exactly.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Looks like they found two, um, well they found something yesterday -- a package, in some, uh, bushes, but it wasn't nothing, you know, wh- -- they just had to make sure, you know, because that's --
L:  I wonder if that's was in Westwood where I was.
R:  Oh, oh, let me see --
L:  You don't know.
R:  I don't know, I think it was -- yeah, it was up in -- might be -- it might have been in Wiltshire.
L:  Yup.
R:  That was it then.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  It was on some bushes.
L:  It was -- it was in the morning on the way to work, it was -- it was pretty crazy and, uh --
R:  Yeah, that's probably it then.
L:  -- and everything just stops and, um --
R:  Yeah, you know what?  Yeah, 'cause they -- they blocked, um, both, um, [NOISE] east and west traffic on Wiltshire -- [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh, that -- yeah, I was in it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You was.
L:  So, uh -- no, I was actually -- I was talking to somebody, it was, um, [LIPSMACK] I think it was last Thursday --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, I was -- for my job, I was talking to somebody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that was in New York --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- and as I was talking to them, he said, "Oh, my god, what is this world coming to, there was just a bomb that went off at Duke University" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- now, you heard about that?
R:  [NOISE] Um, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  At Duke University?
L:  Okay.  I believe it was -- it was -- I don't know, maybe it was -- maybe it wasn't Duke, but it was -- it was, uh, up in, uh -- in New York [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- s- -- and, um, it wasn't terrorist related, but I think, you know, somebody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- set off a bomb as we were --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- talking on the phone, it was going on --
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  -- so, [COUGH] there we go.  But a- as far as, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how it's affected my life, um, [LIPSMACK] I- I've also been much more cau- cautious and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, there was all these things in the paper that everybody was going to the store and they were getting duct tape --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and going to the survival stores and stocking up on food and -- and things like that and oxygen masks and, uh, you know, I don't know if you took any precautions or anything like that. [SIGH]
R:  Yes, I did.  Well, I -- I bought me some lot of water also, you know -- you know, canned goods and every th- -- it's like the same thing that happened with that earthquake?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you had to been when that -- when that what happened, you know, I always had to be prepared.  It said, "Get a lot of water and all that", you know, just in case, you never know happens, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I wasn't going to take no chances, so I had to go out and get it.
L:  [SIGH] I -- I also, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [COUGH] as far as spirituality, I really started thinking about the people in my life that were really important --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I had, uh, I guess, t- took for granted and thought that, you know, it just -- it could be over with and, uh, you know, one always knows that, you know, 'cause you -- they say you live each day like it's your last day, or live, you know, your life to the fullest every day, but, uh --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, I forget, so this was just kind of, um, [SIGH] a real shock and, um, I was, uh -- I --I was numb for quite a while and I know some of my friends, they, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they h- -- I know it's -- it's been a while now, but, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they had trouble sleeping and uh, they had anxiety and --
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  -- uh, just a lot of fear [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [COUGH] because, um, [MN] it was just, um, it's that feeling of, uh --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- not having any control, you don't know --
R:  [MN] Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- what's going to happen. [COUGH] But, I mean, are you -- how are you doing now, I mean, it's been, you know, a few years?
R:  Wh- -- now is, um, let me see, how can I say this?  Is -- I mean, I'm doing fine right now, you know, but then they -- we're back on an orange alert --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, so you never know -- I mean, then wh- wh- what really triggered me is that they found out that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- last week -- I think it was last week, yeah -- that one of the FBI's were training at bin Laden's camp.
L:  I didn't hear about that.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he was a United States FBI agent and he was training at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bin Laden -- now that's scary --
L:  That's very scary.
R:  -- knowing that one of -- er -- oh -- uh -- government --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- people of the United States is training with bin Laden.  Y- -- so you don't know who you can trust these days --
L:  It --
R:  -- since this happened, you know?
L:  Yeah, it seems like when you finally start calming down and relaxing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then something happens --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and it makes you start getting uptight again --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- [SIGH] so ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  I -- I don't know. Um, I, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have surveys on the computer if, you know, we think there's going to be another terrorist attack here and, uh -- do you think there is?
R:  [MN] In the United States, yes --
L:  I do to- --
R:  -- where, I don't know, because fact of the reason is bin Laden said, if anything happened to, um -- if they have -- if they break out with war, uh, he will get United States.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, I believe -- the reason I said I believe it will, because he said he's going to, uh, bomb the, uh, Twin Towers and they didn't believe him and when he did it, then they believe him, so anything he says out his mouth I'll -- I'll put it in -- I don't care how I hear it, but, you know, I just got to take the conscience of me, I really do believe what he says for now.  You know, he might want us to be scared, you know, he might say, "Yeah, I want [inaudible] 'cause I know they scare out there", you know, I mean, it's --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- y- you gotta be alert, [MN] I mean, I don't take no chances -- I, you know -- I only be --
L:  I mean, there's --
R:  -- like once you --
L:  -- only so much you can do --
R:  You can't do nothing really --
L:  -- and I mean, you gotta li- li- --
R:  -- you stay away from crowded places.
L:  -- you gotta live your life, I mean, I don't know if you've stopped -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to, like, Disneyland, or some of these large sporting events or are you just --
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  -- you've changed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your lifestyle at all?
R:  No, I'm still going there -- [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  I'm a still go there.  I'm, you know, um, actually --
L:  What about travelling?
R:  Travelling?  I don't do too much travelling --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but, I'm possibly doing some travelling this, uh, July, so I will still continue doing travelling. [NOISE] I'm still going to, you know, travel -- take my little vacation in -- in July.
L:  [MN] Have you been on a plane since nine eleven?
R:  No, no.
L:  Okay.  I was on -- I took two planes last September and October and I was really scared -- [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  -- and uh, [COUGH] you know, this --
