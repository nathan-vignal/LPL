L:  Hi, I'm Alicia.
R:  Hi, I'm Pat.
L:  [MN] Um, so the topic is what changes we've made?
R:  What changes you've made, yeah, since nine eleven.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, for me, um, I think I've pretty much gone back to my same old ways, but I think, like, right after it happened I was, you know, a little stunned and -- and scared and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  I definitely -- like when it first happened I -- I'm from Chicago, where are you from?
R:  [NOISE] Maine.
L:  Well I -- I lived right in the city of Chicago and -- and I work in the loop, so that was kind of scary.  Like later on we -- [MN] we discovered that the Se- -- the Sears tower was --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- um, was going to be a -- a target because I had worked a few blocks from there and I know that -- that -- that, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- our building would have been hit by the Sears tower --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, which would have been scary but the things that I -- like the day that I was there, or the day that it happened I -- I was watching the news and the second, um, plane actually hit while live on the news.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I still went to work 'cause, um, you know, I didn't hear otherwise about the city closing or anything, and so I went to work and, um, we eventually, like, maybe after, like, an hour or so left the office and everything was closed and -- and, um, it was impossible to -- to find a way home by that point because everybody was leaving and -- [SIGH] watched the news for a few days and then I got kind of like nervous --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about everything and then eventually it -- it just went back to normal.  What about you?
R:  I didn't make any changes.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  Did you, um -- what about the second time around when, ah, gosh I can't remember where -- where's the newer --
R:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thing?  Oh, when, like, around the time of -- of the beginning of the war when they were talking about stocking up with different things.  Did you -- what did you think about that?  Did you think it was ridiculous to --
R:  I didn't do it.
L:  -- change?  No?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, if it's going to happen it's going to happen and you're not going to stop it.
L:  Well, exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I don't -- I don't think that I actually, like, made -- I didn't -- I didn't do anything physical, like -- like I didn't go out and buy anything and things like that --
R:  Mhm.  No.
L:  -- but I didn't stop going out.  Um, but you know I -- I felt like I -- being in the -- being in the city like there are a lot of changes.  Like there are a lot more police out.  So it was like -- and -- and then the news it was totally in your face, you know?  There's no way that you could avoid the -- you know, thinking about what happened and stuff like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  but other than that -- 
R:  You know --
L:  Di- --
R:  -- I mean, it's one of those things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was out of our control.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  So [MN] what was there to change [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't like change anyway, but --
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No and somebody just said, "Well, you won't fly".  Well I wouldn't fly before then either so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, flying, let's see.  Um, I ended up going -- I went overseas not -- not that much longer.  Let's see, that was October, November, December, January -- I think about five months later I went overseas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, 'cause I had already made -- I'd made reservations and there were a lot of people that were -- that I knew that were asking me, you know, like, "Are you scared or anything?" but I wasn't.  By that -- by that time it seemed like it was, like -- I would -- I -- it probably would have been a little scary going on a plane, like, a couple of days after.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't think that I would have not gone on one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, there -- there was a lot more security of course after that and I've gotten stopped at security gates before and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or after -- after -- after nine eleven, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gotten everything done.  But the one thing that's kind of -- kind of freaky is -- is after all the -- the talk about having the Feds come in to -- to do security and stuff and -- and make sure that -- that nobody can get on the plane with anything, I ended up getting on a plane with mace --
R:  With what?
L:  -- not realizing.  I had mace in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in my purse.  I didn't even realize I had it in my purse.
R:  Wow.
L:  I didn't remember.  I didn't realize it until I had -- it was a business trip that -- that I was on and -- and I -- it was like almost a year -- a year later.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I was in the hotel room and I was taking stuff out of my purse and I found it.  I'm like, "Oh, my goodness.  They didn't even notice that I had mace".
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  That was supposed to be illegal, so I didn't want to take the chance of bringing [LAUGH] -- bringing it back with me, so I gave it to a coworker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm like, okay you take this for self defense, but I'm not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not going to take the chance of [LAUGH] coming back with it, and, you know --
R:  Don't blame you.
L:  -- having the third degree.
R:  Don't blame you at all.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  But, ah, did you -- did you know anybody who suffered from the attacks or anything, or ...?
R:  That was what?
L:  Did you know anybody from -- for -- that was -- that was -- that suffered from the attacks that --
R:  No.
L:  -- changed that --
R:  No.
L:  -- themselves or anything?
R:  No.  The only thing we did was worry about my boyfriend's sister-in-law's daughter.
L:  Oh.  Was she -- was she near N- New York at the time, or ...?
R:  She was [SIGH] over the bridge.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And for some reason she didn't go to work that day and she saw it.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So, you know, that was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about all I worried about.
L:  Yeah.  When we -- when my friend and I went overseas we went to -- we went to London and -- and so I got to see, like, how everybody's opinions were in Europe.  You know, 'cause Europe -- Ameri- -- like, you know, America is like -- a lot of Americans think that we're invincible --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that nothing's going to happen to us and, you know, it's like I don't -- I -- I don't think it was like necessarily a good thing, but I think it, like, made a lot of people realize that, you know what?
R:  What?
L:  You know, we're just like everybody else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and you -- you can't think, like, we're like the, oh, you know, nothing will happen to us.  We're -- we're the best in the world and everything else, you know, like, I notice that, like, a lot of Europeans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when we were overseas were -- were thinking, you know, like it's almost kind of like -- I -- I didn't agree with it necessarily, but a lot of them thought of it as having us put in our place --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in a way, you know?  And it was like, well that's pretty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a pretty rude way of [LAUGH] having it done.  But -- but, yeah.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah, so, um.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you -- did you watch the news at all while it happened, or --
R:  I saw it afterwards and I got very tired of hearing about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, the same --
L:  It became very sensationalist, didn't it?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]  The same as with the war.  I'm -- I'm very tired of hearing about it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, did you do any protesting for the war or anything?
R:  Did I do any what?
L:  Any protesting --
R:  No.
L:  -- for the war or did you -- do you have any opinion whether we should have gone or not or ...?
R:  Mm, not really.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, I just, you know -- I make it senseless in itself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  People are getting killed for no reason.
L:  Right.  Definitely.
R:  You know, so --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- 'cause I think, you know, being a -- being a lot nicer everybody could get along with everybody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they're not going to.
L:  No. [LAUGH]  Definitely not.
R:  That isn't the way it's supposed to be.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, and depending on how you look at it, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.  Definitely.
R:  -- if you -- if, you know -- if you had any religious stuff in your life growing up then, you know, it was all predicted.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was all predicted.
L:  Mm.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as my grandfather would say, "Survival of the fittest".
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  It's, you know, a way of weeding out and getting rid -- rid of people that, you know, [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know how I want to word it.
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  Just, you know -- just a way of getting rid of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's going to go on for as long as we're on this planet.
L:  I know, it's like, you know, in -- in the animal kingdom, the animal world, it's like in a way there's wars every day, you know, like -- 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- with, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, different -- different animals and surviving, and --
R:  But we're not animals, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  I know.
R:  That's how it -- that's how it goes.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess it's just if it's time it's time and why fight the issue, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But [MN] --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- I do, you know, in some w- -- see I don't -- my personal opinion is Bush isn't running this anyway, it's his father doing it through him.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, wait for daddy to finish unfinished business.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of -- of Bush.
R:  You know, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think it's aged him a lot.
L:  Pardon?
R:  It's aged him a lot.
L:  Oh, I could see that, yeah.
R:  You know, I mean no one person can solve -- can resolve everything.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  And that's -- it's almost like -- seems like it's what they're trying to do.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  You know, I'm in this role of power of so I'm going to resolve all this stuff and people are just going to go along with the way I'm going to do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, you know, who's he going to have to blame if he falls flat on his face?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know?  What -- what cabinet member, what -- you know, what --
