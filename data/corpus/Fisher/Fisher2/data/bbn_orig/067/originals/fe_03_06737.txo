R:  Um, what's you name.
L:  Jennifer.
R:  I'm Emily.
L:  Hi, pleased to --
R:  H-
L:  -- to talk to you.
R:  [LAUGH] Nice to talk to you too.  Where are you calling from?
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, wow, I'm from Chicago, but I'm t- calling from Salt Lake City.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Are you -- okay.
R:  So --
L:  So, health and fitness.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] interesting topic. [LAUGH] [SIGH] I need to work out more. [LAUGH] I went to --
L:  Do you work out at all?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I've been starting, I've been doing better.  Well, I used to swim every day and then I haven't for a while, and then I hiked all last summer, but I haven't since school started.  How about you?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I ride a bike pretty much every day to get around the city. Um, just for m- like -- like, I enjoy it, and I enjoy that type of transportation and I like [SIGH] the health benefits from it, [SIGH] like, keeping you in shape and muscled toned and everything. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, that's really neat.
L:  Um, I also walk a lot and, uh, I would lie to swim.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Swimming is my favorite exercise. [SIGH] 
R:  Yes, I love to swim. [LAUGH] 
L:  It's the greatest. I don't do any kind --
R:  I walk a lot.
L:  Oh, you do --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- walk a lot?
R:  [SIGH] I do, I walk quite a bit.  I need to bike, biking's really fun too.
L:  Yeah, it's amazing.
R:  I don't have a bike right now, though, but I'd really like one. [LIPSMACK] What kind of bike do you have?
L:  Um, I have -- [SIGH] well, I had a Swin[?] Latour[?] from the seventies, um, but I was --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- borrowing it off a friend [SIGH] while she was traveling and she came back and [SIGH] I'm actually going on Thursday to, like, buy bike parts and build my own bike.
R:  Oh, that's awesome.
L:  Yeah, I don't know --
R:  That's cool fun.
L:  -- like, what kind of bike I'm going to get yet, but I'm kind of -- I have friends that own a bike shop and they, like, fix bikes and they have --
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  -- an attic with, like, all these bike parts, and, um --
R:  [LAUGH] So cool.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] it's, yeah, super exciting, so, [SIGH] yeah, I'm going to be doing that soon, so 
R:  So you have all different kinds of bikes. [LAUGH] You have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like a -- yeah, like a --
L:  Yeah, you can --
R:  -- [LAUGH] high, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] but and [inaudible]. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you just kinda go -- like, take what you like from bikes and build your own, and it's, like, fifty bucks instead of, like, you know, hundreds or thousand of dollars --
R:  That's so cool.
L:  -- for a bike.  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, 'cause actually I'm saving up right now for a mountain bike.
L:  Oh, awesome.
R:  [NOISE] But, yeah, we'll see.
L:  Are you planning on using that to, like, get around, or do you just want to -- specifically just to take it places and ride it?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I'd take it up into the mountains and -- and I was thinking I'd like that a lot better, especially to get into shape, [LIPSMACK] like, I need -- [SIGH] I probably just need to lose, like, five pounds.  I want to, like, tone up, you know, what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] so, yeah.
L:  Yeah, biking'll definitely do that.  Like, I just had like a tour bike, like, to go -- like, for, you know, city biking [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but when that's how, like, you get around and you're on your bike all day doing stuff, like, you just lose weight so quickly and, um --
R:  And you stayed toned. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and your, like, legs and arms.  It's crazy how, like, much you used your arms and your back whenever you're riding a bike too.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, [SIGH] have -- do you ever do, like, organized exercise, like, aerobics and stuff like that.
R:  [SIGH] I -- I did g- yoga last semester.
L:  Oh, yoga's amazing.
R:  It is really fun, and it was really cool 'cause the instructor was really into, like, you're just competing against yourself and your body, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, not worrying about people around you and stuff which was really good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we just set, like, our goals for, like, specific areas and stuff like that, so it was really cool.
L:  Oh, that is awesome.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I definitely prefer, um, [SIGH] yoga and, like, biking and stuff like that as opposed to, like, going to a gym and working out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  'Cause it just seems -- I've gone a couple of times but it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- seems like everyone stares at you and, like, uh, [LAUGH] I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I just can't do it. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, it seems more like a meat market than [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, a place to work out.  I don't know. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  And plus, like, you're just kind of, like, um, like, doing one thing all the time and [SIGH] it's just hard, It's mind numbing to do stuff like that. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I agree --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and people are just staring at their television or at their [LAUGH] -- or listening to their ear phones.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And whenever you're, like, doing yoga or riding a bike or something like that, like, you can hang out, like, in your head instead of [SIGH] w- worrying about, uh, lots of people looking at you and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [NOISE] --
R:  It's cool.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no. [NOISE] No, I'm okay.  Um, so, hm, what else? [NOISE] So, you're in school? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I go to [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I go [LAUGH] -- yep, I'm college --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm almost finished, so that's good. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  How about you, are you w- are you in school, or ?
L:  Um, nope, I just -- I live in Philadelphia.
R:  Nice.
L:  I used to go to school, [COUGH] and decided that I didn't want to go to school anymore, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no, I hate school.  Um, what are you --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- going for? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] See, that's the thing, I keep changing, so I've been in school a really long time. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] But, yeah, [SIGH] so right now I'm doing English, but I've done environmental science and --
L:  Oh, yeah, that's --
R:  -- all the trimmings.
L:  -- yeah, I was doing environmental science, it was really fun.
R:  Oh, that's cool, that's really cool --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- yeah. [LIPSMACK] I guess we have to talk about health and fitness more, huh?
L:  Yeah, I don't know, I don't know if I have anything --
R:  So, what do you eat --
L:  -- else to say about health and fitness.
R:  -- too, um [LAUGH] --
L:  Um [LAUGH] --
R:  -- [SIGH] to maintain your wonderful physique? [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I, um -- [SIGH] whenever I'm not as poor as I am right now, I try to have [LAUGH] a vegan --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- strict vegan diet. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But, uh, [SIGH] I'm definitely a vegetarian, but, uh --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- whenever [NOISE] I don't have much money, I end up eating, like, [NOISE] crap that I don't want to eat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, so 
R:  Yeah, that's definitely -- eating vegan's very expensive.
L:  Mhm, what about you?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I was vegetarian for a while, and I don't -- I don't eat much meat anymore --
L:  Mhm, like --
R:  -- like --
L:  -- what -- what meat did you --
R:  just experimenting.
L:  -- start eating? [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I started eating chicken [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- which isn't --
L:  Yeah, you eat chicken?
R:  -- really great. [SIGH] Yeah, every now and then.  I [inaudible] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, yeah, I will.
L:  Hm. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] And I shouldn't, [LAUGH] but --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, if you feel like you need it.
R:  -- I guess that I'm poor and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I guess chicken is cheap, I just, um -- [LIPSMACK] I've been a vegetarian since -- oh, for, like, twelve years now, so --
R:  Oh, that's awesome.
L:  -- um, just can't -- just can't [MN] --
R:  [SIGH] I really respect people who can keep it up because I think it takes a lot of energy to know exactly -- like, you should eat these many proteins or whatever and keep it all straight.
L:  Oh, yeah, I didn't even get into that stuff until, uh, recently.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Um, I worked at a few health food stores [SIGH] and that helped me out, like, learning what -- like, w- what was in certain foods and, like, how much of what you need to eat in a day. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, that's really cool.
L:  But, [SIGH] um, personal view, like, -- like I bike all the time, whenever you work out a lot, like, your body is kinda like craving for what you need. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So, [SIGH] I eat --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I notice --
L:  -- a lot of tofu.
R:  -- that too, if you listen to your body.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Definitely, definitely.
R:  But --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, eating --
R:  [LAUGH] Um, [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Uh [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] So do you have any --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- weights? [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] D- do I have weights?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Uh, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, [LAUGH] I don't either.
L:  [LAUGH] That's the only thing I did -- like, uh, doing in the gym was lifting weights, but [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can't do it all the time, so 
R:  Yeah, did you have one of those cool belts? [LAUGH] 
L:  No, do you have one?
R:  [LAUGH] No, [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] my cousin just got the -- one of those, like, uh, machines off the TV --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like the [LAUGH] --
R:  Like, the Nordic track one, or ?
L:  -- one of those, like, machines off the TV. [LAUGH] Um, sorry, I make fun of myself, that was a really dumb sentence.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Uh, [SIGH] oh, I can't remember what it is but it's some weird bow -- like, I think it might be a [inaudible]. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  But he's, like, obsessed with it and he swears -- like, he's -- he's always been in shape [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- um, but he swears it's like the best thing ever.
R:  Really?
L:  I find it hard to believe, yeah, but --
R:  Hm.
L:  Hm. [SIGH] So --
R:  [SIGH] I guess if you spend lots of money --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- though, you need to, like -- you know, you have to feel good about it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] But --
L:  That's true. [SIGH] 
R:  That's cool.
L:  Um, yeah, it's -- it's, like, uh -- [SIGH] these phone call are so painful [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- sometimes, 'cause you're like, "Ten minutes is so long".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think -- [SIGH] last time, the guy, he didn't speak much English and he didn't --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- understand what we were supposed to talk about.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  So we spent the whole time, like, trying to explain, like, [LAUGH] what we're supposed to talk about.
L:  [NOISE] What the topic was and then --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- your time was probably up. 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, that's horrible. [SIGH] Yeah, my last phone conversation was about smoking and, like, I was talking --
R:  That was mine too.
L:  Oh, okay, oh we must have [LAUGH] called on the same day. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's so funny.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it was horrible, I was, like, um, [SIGH] yes, [SIGH] it was like --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I had nothing else to say about that [NOISE] [inaudible] [NOISE] [SIGH] Weird. [COUGH] So, um, you grew up in Chicago, and now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you live in Salt Lake City?
R:  [SIGH] I'm going to school out here, yeah.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And then, uh -- and the hiking's wonderful out here, it's so beautiful. [LIPSMACK] But I don't know if I'll stay. I don't know, I haven't decided yet, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's really pretty.
L:  Is -- is that the only college that you've been to?
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I go to Bingaman[?] University.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I've heard of --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- that.  Yeah, I hear there are beautiful parts of Utah, like, and -- [NOISE] like, people don't realize --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how beautiful it is up there.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] it is really beautiful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, and it's -- it's easy to keep in shape, like, if you're -- if you take advantage of the outdoors it is.  Like you were saying, you know what I mean, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just, like, biking, 'cause it's fun or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's good.
L:  It would definitely be nice to have, like, [NOISE] [inaudible] or something, like, nature close by [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and go hiking all the time, that would be amazing.
R:  I love the city too, though, 'cause I -- I miss --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- Chicago, like, just -- it's just so fun, there's always something going on and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just really fun.
L:  Yeah, probably sort of --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- like Philadelphia.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I've been to Chicago a few times.  I actually lived, um, in a suburb called Boling- Bolingbrook.
R:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Um, for, like, six weeks.
R:  Oh, that's cool. [LAUGH] 
L:  But [LAUGH] it's a horrible place. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Bolingbrook? [LAUGH] Yeah, it is. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] It was, like, just, uh, like, corporate build up and nothing else.
R:  [SIGH] So you probably don't -- you probably don't have very fond memories of Chicago, [LAUGH] then.
L:  No, no, no, I had to drive into the city every day 'cause I --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- was dating a [inaudible] and he worked at the [inaudible] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, so I used to drive into the city, like, twenty miles every day, it used to take and hour and a half, you know, the traffic --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was just, like, such a panic [inaudible] situation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I hated it. [SIGH] 
R:  Oh. 
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I'd like to go back [SIGH] some time.
R:  [SIGH] If you can enjoy it.
L:  It's fun if you just go --
R:  Yeah, and it's fun if you live closer downtown 'cause then you don't have to, like -- y- like you said, have the hassle of going in --
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
R:  -- or having -- yeah, but [LIPSMACK] it's fun.
L:  Of having to commute in.
R:  [SIGH] My parents --
L:  Deal with all the traffic.
R:  -- actually just moved to Atlanta, so -- and I've been there once.
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but there -- it doesn't quite have, like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the same downtown feel as Chicago or Philly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- but it's still pretty cool.
L:  Awesome.  People are -- nobody in Chicago rides bikes either. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's how it -- like, it takes, like, if you want to get from, like, one side of Chicago to the other, it takes, like, all day.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, it does.
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  [SIGH] Well, it's 'cause it's so cold in the wintertime and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bikes -- [MN] everything gets really slick.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  It's really hard to pedal on it.
L:  I moved out of there in October, right before winter came, I'm so happy. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's really good.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] It's pretty nasty in winter.
L:  Yes, oh, god. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] They ac-
