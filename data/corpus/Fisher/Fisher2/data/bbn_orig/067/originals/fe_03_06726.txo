R:  Hello.
L:  H- hello, how are you?
R:  Uh, I'm --
L:  My name's Linda.
R:  Hi, Linda, I'm Anne.
L:  Anne.  And uh, where -- where are you from?
R:  Uh, I'm from Memphis, Tennessee.
L:  From where, I'm sorry?
R:  Memphis, Tennessee.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  And how do you feel about this subject?  Do -- do you exercise?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm from Staten Island, New York and I do not exercise. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I would -- I would like to but I work about fifty hours a week and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- uh, I don't have the energy after work to be quite honest.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, what about you- what about yourself?
R:  Um, I'm a stay at home mom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so my exercise is chasing the toddler.
L:  Oh, well, you know, that -- that counts.  That's your gym.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, my aunt one time had a poster that calculated how many calories you burn when you iron, when you vacuum, when you make a bed, when you give a child a bath and so on.
L:  Right, so -- so you keep that in mind when you're doing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- those activities, yes.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, I, uh, I -- I was working -- I work in furniture retail sales and, uh, on my last job I was -- I was managing a store, living room store, and I was moving furniture and putting up the paintings and things like that and I, you know, got myself into pretty good shape, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and that was -- that was my gym at the time.  
R:  Right.
L:  But then since then I put on a few pounds [LAUGH], you know.
R:  Well, you know, it's really amazing when I was in college I lived in a dorm that was at the complete opposite end of campus from the building where most of my c- classes were --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so I walked probably, uh, six miles a day, um --
L:  Y- wow!
R:  -- just getting back for it and I -- I never really noticed it and then so you graduate from college and then you sit at a desk and keep up your normal calorie --
L:  You -- you remember yourself being thinner then or being in better shape?
R:  Oh yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, 'cause now I'm chasing a toddler around the house, I just get winded playing with him.
L:  Yes.
R:  As I sit here and eat a bowl of ice cream [LAUGH].
L:  Right [LAUGH].  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  On top of which I -- I -- I hate to admit because we're undesirables right now, especially in New York, but I do smoke.
R:  Mm.
L:  So [LAUGH] -- so, uh, but I -- I don't think, uh, the- they've made it very, uh, very hard to really smoke in New York, you know.
R:  Really?
L:  You can't go anywhere, you can't stand in front of the building so, I mean, that -- that's all for the better, you know, as far as --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- uh, your health is concerned.  You can't even really stand in front of an office building smoking.
R:  Do they really enforce it?
L:  They do.
R:  Oh.
L:  Indeed.  No, uh, no bar allows you to sm- -- I mean, there are a few exceptions, uh, uh, uh, with -- with what would be, uh, pipe sm- pipe bars, tobacco, you know, cigar bars rather --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, so they'll -- you know, because their whole business is based on the premise of smoking, I guess --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they'll allow them to do so but they have very rigid, um, regulations as well.  In your average bar --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you can't smoke.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, so for the non smokers it's very good but for the smokers as well, you know, you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- really -- you -- you, uh -- it really minimizes your smoking.
R:  That's really funny.  In -- back when I was in shape at college I was also smoking.  Um, but it's amazing how, um, when I smoked other people's smoke didn't bother me.  I couldn't smell it on my clothes, I couldn't smell it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, in my car but then when I stopped smoking I can smell the guy in the car next -- in the lane next to me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can smell his cigarette smoke.
L:  Really?
R:  It's just amazing how sensitive I've become to it.
L:  So, after college you stopped smoking?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.  The -- pretty soon after?
R:  Um, no, actually when my met my husband -- well, when my husband and I started dating he, uh, didn't ap- I don't -- I don't wanna say, didn't approve, he, um --
L:  Right, it -- it didn't go together because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he wasn't a smoker?  Right.
R:  He just didn't -- he didn't like it.
L:  And so, you know, eventually -- you know, eventually it's -- um, I find, um, for myself I'm a camaraderie smoker and if you don't have, uh -- your significant doesn't smoke and, you know, your -- your closest friends don't smoke, you -- you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- kinda shy away from it after a while.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, you know, but that -- that's very good, you know, because again it -- it's -- it's like -- it's -- it's no fun, as I'm saying -- you know, generally I find myself smoking more if I'm around smokers, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, have you made any New Year's Resolutions to -- to change your health habits?
L:  I haven't because, um, because I really -- because of my job taking up so much of my day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't -- I find that that stops me from smoking quite a bit.  So, really I'll have a few --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- cigarettes when I come home so it didn't really stick out as -- as -- uh, in the forefront of my mind in terms of something that I need to stop --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, uh, you know, it -- in a sense, um, you know, because I'm not smoking, even a half a pack a day most times, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, I -- I just figured, you know, it wasn't -- it wasn't that much of a big deal but if I'm -- if I reduce my smoking that much I -- maybe I should quit altogether [LAUGH], you know.
R:  [LAUGH] What --
L:  But, uh -- 'cause you really can't go anywhere, you know, anymore and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and smoke so it -- you know, you may was well just quit altogether especially, you know, living here, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so have you -- have you visited New York?
R:  Oh, it has been probably fifteen years since I've been to New York City.
L:  Yeah.  It's changed a lot I guess.  In some ways for the good and some ways not but I'm -- I'm digressing from the -- from the subject of, uh, exercise.  Um, so you -- you -- you feel that the amount of exercise that you're getting is sufficient and -- or would you like --
R:  Well --
L:  -- to do more?
R:  I'd like to do more.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I know that right now my -- I have a two and a half year old and a nine month old --
L:  Ooh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and --
L:  That's a lot of work.  That's a lot --
R:  It is.  
L:  Yeah
R:  It really is but --
L:  I -- I don't have any children so -- because of the hours that I have to work so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but go ahead [NOISE].
R:  Uh, I -- I do enjoy being a mom but I know that exercise right now is just not going to happen.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, when I play with the -- the little crawling --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- nine month old --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, I'll put him on my knees and toss him up in the air and -- and count that as leg lifts, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, well, I mean, it does -- it does count, you know, it definitely does --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.
R:  I'll do a couple of extra things here and there and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, and I -- I try and -- and, uh, put it in wherever I can just --
L:  Well, it -- when they get, like, school age and then, uh, the younger one goes to pre school then would you -- do you see yourself, you know, gradually, uh, going to, like, a jazzercise class or something like that? 
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You know, when -- when that time comes, you know.
R:  Yeah. There's --
L:  Do you --
R:  -- uh, my brother's girlfriend gave me, um, yoga equipment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and about one month after she gave it to me I finally went out and found, uh, a yoga tape that I wanted to use and, uh, it's been sitting on the top of my entertainment center, um --
L:  Yeah, I have the -- I -- I -- I -- forgive me, I don't know how to, uh, pronounce it correctly but Pilates, I think it is.
R:  That sounds good.
L:  Y- yoga?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Are you familiar with it?
R:  I have seen it and I know Oprah did a show it.
L:  I have a tape of that and, uh, I -- I -- you know, I did follow the tape a couple of times --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and really I found it to be quite good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because, uh, of course when you have a tape you can -- you can regulate [NOISE], you know, put it on pause, do whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is necessary and then get back to it.  But I didn't find it to be too strenuous and, you know, I found it something you can really, uh, you know, develop with that, you know.
R:  Well, good.
L:  So, I -- I recommend that if you're -- if you are, you know, have videos.  Even if -- even if you're -- you -- you just put it in and then, you know, you're -- of course, you're doing other things somehow it motivates you so that when you do have a spare moment --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you'll think -- think of it, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Even if you don't follow the video, just let it play sometimes, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And get an idea, you know, uh, how to gradually get back into the swing of things, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Every little bit helps.
L:  That's right, that's right.  Well, I -- I mean, I -- I admire the fact you are at home and -- and are taking care of small children and -- you know, I -- I really do I -- I think that, um, I'm so -- I'm so used to -- well, economically I've always had to but, uh, I'm so used to working by now I think I'd feel a little anxious being at home, you know.
R:  You know, I thought I would and, um, I keep myself really, really busy --
L:  As long as you -- as long as you have, like, a schedule that you keep to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and you don't let, uh -- you know, you don't start feeling confined or anything like that but you have to be, I guess -- I would have to be disciplined, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- up at eight, you know, and whatever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you have to do and you have plans with the children and everything like that.
R:  Right, well --
L:  As long as you keep to those things and you have some good friends around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that that quells it, you know, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but in New York if you don't have, um, some friends, you know, right in your neighborhood or, you know, um, [LIPSMACK] really neighbors don't get together too much so if you're at home you're, like, at home, that's it, you know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh, it --
R:  Well --
L:  -- you don't feel at your best, yeah.
R:  -- I have found -- of course the south is probably a little bit different perspective but, um, I go to the playground and I meet other moms and, uh, my child gets to run around with other kids and ...
