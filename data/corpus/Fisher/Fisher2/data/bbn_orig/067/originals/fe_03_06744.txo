L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello, uh, my name is Ophelia Petrello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hello.  Yes, my name is Ophelia Petrello.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes, [NOISE] and what was the topic again?  I didn't get it.
R:  Uh, nine eleven.
L:  [NOISE] Nine eleven?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, in [inaudible] -- in, uh, New York?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You want --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to, uh, know my -- my thoughts about that?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I guess we both got to talk about it.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  All right, um --
R:  Where are you calling from? [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] I'm calling from, uh, Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, okay. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm in, um [LAUGH] --
L:  What area?
R:  -- Pennsylvania area.
L:  It's Culver City.
R:  Oh, okay, it -- I'm in Pennsylvania.
L:  Yes, well, I'm in Los Angeles, in the area of Culver City.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  But Los Angeles, uh, is the main, um, city.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.  Shall I start?
R:  Yeah, go ahead.
L:  Yes, okay.  I -- I was, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, uh, surprised by the attack --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, uh, from what I've read in the paper --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the -- that the -- the, um [LIPSMACK] -- the government, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- knew, uh, a lot of information to be [inaudible] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] and they didn't, uh, do anything about it. [SIGH] I know that the -- that they had, um, [LIPSMACK] information about the men who were on the airplane. [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
L:  And, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they had previous information about all this --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [NOISE] and, uh, still they did -- --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they hesitated to do anything, right?
R:  They didn't do very much about it.
L:  Wh- what?
R:  They didn't do very much about it.
L:  No, they did not. [NOISE] That's why I think it's a terrible thing, [SIGH] uh, for the country a- and, um, [LIPSMACK] for the state.  I've read a lot about, um, [LIPSMACK] New York and -- and they're building it up and they, uh, took a long time to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- clean [SIGH] everything and, uh, they're trying to get themselves back -- uh, adjusted to the normal, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- life and routine.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Which is going to be hard, but, um, [NOISE] I also read that they're going to construct, um --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- a new --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE] [COUGH] 
L:  -- center, a shopping center. [NOISE] 
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes, they're --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- going to build a new shopping center --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they're going to build, uh, a lot of things that were blown up. [NOISE] And, uh, [COUGH] as far as the tragedy's [NOISE] concerned, uh, for the nation, I think it was terrible, I hope that it never happens again.
R:  Absolutely. [SIGH] Where were you when it happened?
L:  I was here in Los Angeles.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was here at my home.
R:  I guess -- what time did that -- I guess that was what, six o'clock in the morning?
L:  Yes, it was early in the morning when it happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, like I say, everyone, uh, here where I live, uh [SIGH] --
R:  Did they wake --
L:  -- they were --
R:  -- call -- somebody call you, or did you have the TV on?
L:  Nah, we-- we were watching television, yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We -- we got everything, um, the information, uh, from the tel- and the radio also.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But, uh, that was the primary, uh, conversation piece here where I live and, uh, [SIGH] I'm sure that it was a topic of conversation anywhere else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I'm sorry to say that -- that there were so many casualties [NOISE] and -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] they, uh, finally dug up, uh, most of the bodies that were buried.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is that correct?
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH] Yes, and, uh, I've read where -- where [NOISE] just a few were still, uh, unaccounted for.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] And also, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they, um, [LIPSMACK] also I [NOISE] note that they, uh, made a big, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] statue, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- regarding the firemen [NOISE] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that were on call.
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  That served --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- that served, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, at the -- at the, uh [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at the disaster.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  [NOISE] And I know -- I know that they have a big statue there, [SIGH] I -- I don't know exactly where they placed it, but, um, I also read where they, uh [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- were -- were making a big statue, um, co- and couldn't, um, considering the firemen that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- served in -- in -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- everything and -- and those that did not serve, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] They should be, uh, well rewarded [NOISE] and -- and well, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- recom- conde- recommended for anything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pertaining to -- to the city.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Yes, and also, uh, the mayor.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Mayor Giuliani.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes, I read the other day that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he got married --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- finally got married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if you have read about it but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they said -- I saw it on television, um, the other day that -- that he finally, uh, got married and it showed him and his wife [NOISE] and -- and the ceremony and, um, [SIGH] I often wonder if -- if he was not the man --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] that was at the right place at the right time.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] I often wonder about that.
R:  Well --
L:  Do you understand what I mean?
R:  Yes, I think so.
L:  D- do you think that he would be [NOISE] so publicized i- if [NOISE] he had not been [SIGH] the man there at the right time?  Do you think he would have been distinguished like he is now?
R:  Oh, I -- I --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- I don't know, I don't follow --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, politics so much in, uh, [SIGH] uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, i- in -- f- for New York.
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  Uh, I really don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, because, uh, I read about him [inaudible] there and he -- [SIGH] he's giving seminars and he's giving speeches and -- and, uh, [SIGH] everybody's, uh, having banquets in -- in, uh -- he's like a movie star, you know.  I live here in California in Ho- by Hollywood --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] a- and, uh, the primary thing here is -- is the movie stars.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And it seems to me --
R:  Have you ever seen anybody close up?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yes, several people.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yes, I mean, I live right here, um, not far from, uh, Hollywood, maybe about twenty, thirty miles.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Uh, so, it's very close by and, um, [SIGH] uh, uh, I -- I'm referring to the mayor that -- that he's become, um, sort of like a celebrity. [SIGH] 
R:  I see.
L:  Right, I feel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if you get -- keep up with him, but, um --
R:  No, I don't.
L:  You don't.  But it seemed to me, like -- like, he was the person that was at the right place at the right time.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  You know, to -- to -- to be so -- so, uh, publicized.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Otherwise I d- I don't think he'd [NOISE] get the recognition.  I mean, I had never heard of, uh, Giuliani before.
R:  [SIGH] Uh-huh.
L:  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- as mayor.  Probably the mayor, yes, but not -- not as much as he --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he -- you do now --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And, uh, [MN] anyhow, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- he's very fortunate that -- that -- that he did -- that he is getting, um, the publicity he's getting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  But, um, [NOISE] a- as far as, [NOISE] uh, the disaster goes, [NOISE] like I say, I hope it never happens again.
R:  No, I understand.
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  Yeah, it was quite a -- quite a problem.
L:  Yes, it was, and, uh, [SIGH] it seems like -- like they've had a -- a [NOISE] -- [MN] a -- several, uh, tributes there at -- at -- at the site.
R:  Yes.
L:  They had ceremonies and things like that, the families have gathered and paid their homage to the people [SIGH] and, um, [NOISE] it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's saddening, you know.
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, do you want me to continue?
R:  No, go ahead, I'm listening, yeah.
L:  Okay. [SIGH] And, um, [LIPSMACK] I have often wondered --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, whether it's like to -- I've never gone to New York, [NOISE] and -- but I -- I would be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- interesting to go and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, um, [NOISE] see the area, and by the time I go out there, it -- it -- it'll probably be built up.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think, yeah, probably the next few years.
L:  Yes, and, um, I was going to ask you, uh, this is -- this survey, or whatever you're taking, uh, w- what -- what, uh -- the -- [SIGH] the lady said something about your voice was going to be recorded.
R:  [NOISE] Some -- some are and some are not.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I see.  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess it depends on what they need at the time, or [SIGH] --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- what part of the -- what part of the, uh, country you live in.
L:  Oh, I see, I see.  And then, um, [MN] d- did she say I was, uh, [SIGH] going to be able to call, [NOISE] uh, two more times or three more times?
R:  Uh, yes.  Is this your first time? [NOISE] 
L:  No, um, this first time --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- yeah, she didn't --
R:  Yeah, it's probably --
L:  -- give me very much inform- [SIGH] 
R:  -- three times or five times, I'm not sure.
L:  In a month or -- or two months, or how long?
R:  [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] I think you can call every day, but I don't know how many times that they say you can do it.
L:  Oh, I see.  For how long a period I mean?
R:  Oh, uh, [SIGH] I -- I don't know.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  You'd have to call back that other number.
L:  Oh, I see, I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- see, uh-huh. 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, she just gave me this number to call and, um, [NOISE] uh, to converse with you and, um, [SIGH] I assumed, uh, that, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I was going to pick the topic, but, uh --
R:  No, they pick it for you. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, you -- they pick it for you, I see.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Yes, and like I say, um --
R:  [NOISE] Well, uh, did you, uh [NOISE] know anybody who was killed?
L:  No --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I didn't know anybody, I -- like I said, I've never been there.  I've never --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- been to New York but I -- I would --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- someday would like to go and visit --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I've heard a lot -- a lot of it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and what I read --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about nine and everything --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I'm sure that -- that it's worth going --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, um, [NOISE] you know, paying to go -- go to New York.  Yes, I'd like to have a trip there someday.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] Right, but -- but, uh, I'm single -- I mean, I'm, um, a widow more or less, and, uh, it's hard to get people who --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- who can afford to go over there.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, absolutely.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh, [LIPSMACK] so, uh --
L:  But --
R:  -- yeah, they'll -- they'll tell you when the ten minutes is up, I guess it's close.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, don't hang up, though, because then you won't get paid, you got to keep talking until they [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Until they say stop?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, I see, okay.  Um --
R:  So, um, you could -- what did you think about the TV coverage?
L:  [NOISE] The TV couples?
R:  [MN] The TV coverage.  What did you think about the --
L:  Oh, the television coverage? [NOISE] 
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH] Yes, I did [MN] -- I think they did well.  We get, uh -- I don't know what channels you get over there, but I get channel, um, four -- uh, four, seven and nine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are primarily new stations --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- here. [NOISE] And two [NOISE] and thirteen, [MN] uh, and, um -- [LIPSMACK] they did very good coverage --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on, um, [NOISE] everything.  I think the reporters [NOISE] did very well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We have, um, some very good people here.  You probably don't have the same people over there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] but um, [MN] people that we have here are -- are, um --
R:  [NOISE]
