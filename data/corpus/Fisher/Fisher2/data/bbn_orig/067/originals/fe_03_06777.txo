L:  Hi there.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  My name's April.
R:  Hi, I'm Julie.
L:  Hi, Julie.  Um, I'm out in California.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Utah.
L:  Utah, oh, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [SIGH] topic.  Ah, changes since September eleventh.  Um, well, in general I haven't changed all that much as far as, you know, taking extra precautions or travelling less or anything like that.  Um, I think it's -- you -- you can't live your life waiting for -- or trying to avoid something that may or may not happen, and no matter how much avoidance you do, you're going to get it in [LAUGH] -- end up anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, what about you? [NOISE]
R:  Um, well as far as that goes, I'm pretty much the same.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I've flown since then --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and everything, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yeah, I'm not one to just, you know, sit at home and worry about what's going to happen in the future or anything.
L:  Mm, yeah.  It's like, ah --
R:  But, um, I don't know.  One change I know that I've seen is just -- I don't know, I guess, ah, I used to think like war stories and things like that were really boring and kind of didn't concern me very much.  But I've noticed that after September eleventh I kind of -- I take more [LAUGH] interest in things like that.  Like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things in the past as well as what's going on now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  That makes sense.
R:  -- I don't know.  I -- I'm a lot more [LAUGH] patriotic that I used to be.  Not that I was ever --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- not patriotic, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I just care more [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, it was funny 'cause I would -- you know, I [several inaudible words] in my family and I was always sling -- hang flags out for, ah, you know, patriotic days and things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and wear, you know patriot pins just when we felt like it and people always looked at us kind of funny.  And now it's the norm --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- you know, peop- -- you know, carry the flags on the cars and, you know, people wearing the -- the pins or ribbons and things like that.  Even now it's still happening and it's good to see.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to -- to -- people are still thinking about it.  I remember the first, ah -- the first month or two and it was amazing how much, ah, more courteous people were.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, whether it was, ah, you know, on the road or, you know, in -- in the -- in the malls or wherever, people were realizing -- it, you know, sort of brought everybody together. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Unfortunately that went away. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Eventually yeah.  But even -- and I think that it still has affected enough people that they've pretty much changed from the way things used to be.  I mean, and some people have gone back to, you know, being uncourteous [LAUGH] I guess, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know, I -- I've known a few people who've pretty much changed their whole personality about life and stuff, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.  It is nice.  I mean, you do -- it -- it was funny, I mean -- they -- they -- people were especially -- yeah, the first couple few weeks afterwards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody was just, you know, really nice and -- and, you know, there wasn't a whole lot of smiling going on, but, yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just [MN] the camaraderie.  Ah, everybody was realizing we were in the same boat and we were all Americans instead of being, you know, different races or -- or genders or ages or -- or states or whatever.  It was all one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- giant -- you know, we -- they -- they attacked all of us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then that was -- that was really nice, and -- and I miss the fact that, ah, it sort of brought us together.
R:  Yeah, it was really cool.  And I thought it was also kind of ironic that the terrorists obviously did it to cause panic and disorder --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but it really, like, kind of had the opposite effect in that --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- we became more cautious and also more unified as a people.
L:  That's right.  Oh, that -- that's -- I mean, you talk about the -- the characteristics of -- of, ah, nations and, you know, that there's one of our characteristics.  In times if -- of dire need, if you go back through history we do tend to pull together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean there are always going to be people that panic and -- and things like that, but in general you see, you know, we're helping out the new neighbors and -- and, you know, bringing everything together instead of it falling apart.  And, sort of a, "You don't mess with us" attitude. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Were there any -- well, and -- and I mean I was supposed to -- I was actually supposed to be flying out the -- the day after.  I was supposed to be going out on the twelfth.
R:  Wow.
L:  I was flying across country from, ah, San, ah -- San Francisco to Georgia and, you know, my mom and I talked about it that day 'cause we didn't know how long the airports were going to be closed.  And it's like, "I'm ready to go" you know?  I -- I'm -- ah, well, you know -- you -- you -- I was mad among other things.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I wasn't going to be intimidated or anything like that.  I am very much like that.  I -- I don't put up with stuff.  You know, I don't go cower somewhere because, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- somebody might possibly be mean to me.  Um, and so, yeah, w- -- a- as soon as we could get -- I mean, I -- we actually made reservations for the next day and that didn't go through, and eventually there was like three reservations before we ended up going about a week later.  But you know, it's like I -- I was going, you know?  And it was nice to see that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, people were on the plane.  The -- the -- the flight was still booked, and, ah, so it -- it -- people weren't all just staying home or taking the train or anything like that and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know.  And as far as now, you see the -- the warnings that they've changed it to the -- it's the orange, the high level.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it's -- it's kind of good to know and ki- -- and almost more to gird your loins in case something does happen, than actually doing anything in preparation.  So what do you think about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the, ah -- that system -- the -- the color system?
R:  What do I think about the color system?
L:  Yeah, the -- the -- the red, orange, yellow.  I mean, do you think it does anything or ...?
R:  Well, I don't really know very much about it actually.
L:  Oh, basically we've got the right -- we've been pretty much either on yellow, um, or orange.  Right now they just bumped it up this last week or so to orange.  And it was, ah, you know, basically saying it's a high threat 'cause there's a possibility.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And -- and I guess red is if they have pretty much verifiable information that somebody is going to be doing something and -- and, you know, they're going to close, you know, monuments and freeways and stuff like that, and possibly borders.  And orange is where they have a lot of, ah, coverage out there keeping, ah, maybe not closing some things but definitely, ah, you know, putting on extra, ah, guards and things like that.  Searching more things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I guess the yellow is more of a, you know, we're cautious because, you know, we know the people are after us but at this point we don't think that anybody is -- is planning anything right this second.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and, you know, there's a lot of debate about it because people are talking about, well it's -- okay, what are we supposed to do?  Is it just making people panic or -- or what?  And it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it is, it's [SIGH] too much of the time, you know, people were saying afterward, you know, that, "Why wasn't -- why wasn't this stopped?" and things like that.  It's -- okay, you can't stop somebody who's determined.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if they're bound and determined to [NOISE] come and do something, okay, ten of 'em may not make it but one of them might.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the fact is that you hear all the things that, you know, things are stopped constantly and one thing -- big thing went through.  But you can't protect yourself all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Like I live out here in Cali- -- in California there's earthquake country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, we had the big one in, ah, think it was like eighty six -- eighty nine.  And, ah, you know, people afterwards are, you know "Oh, I have my water and stuff now" and my mother didn't want to replace any of our breakable stuff 'cause we lost a lot of glass and -- and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, um, ceramics and stuff like that.  And it's like, "You know mom, you can't live you know as if anything could happen the next day, you've got to live your life".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  You shouldn't live your life in a padded cell or anything.
L:  No, it's not much of a life if you do.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that makes sense to me.  I mean obviously there's always going to be the possibility of something bad happening, but, you know, I mean life goes on [LAUGH] from there and -- yeah, I mean it's good always to be prepared, but I don't think that we should, you know, be more prepared because something that's going to happen that we think might happen, you know, we should just always have the same level of preparedness and just know that, you know, if something bad happens we're okay.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I just -- it kind of seems funny to me that people never worry about, you know, food storage or whatever until something bad happens, and then suddenly they're like, "Oh, I guess I should do that" [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's just kind of funny.
L:  Yeah.  People -- and people are people, you know.  We get --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- [SIGH] we get lazy and we get complacent and then we get reminders and then all of a sudden we get vigilant again.  And then it lies down and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we're not as careful and --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  But, you know --
R:  I guess all of us have problems with being consistent.
L:  Well, it's human nature.  Nobody wants to live constantly afraid or, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- making it too difficult.  So, yes, we -- we have, you know, our home security system on the house and we try to remember to turn it on all the time, but, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- we're not looking out the blind -- the drapes every day and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, things like that.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's a r- -- there's a -- there's a recommended level and -- and a realistic level.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, you know, anything below or above that's not necessarily a good idea.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's balancing.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  And then so, you know, as far as nine eleven I -- I'm trying to be a little more aware of what's going on in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I never was a big news watcher, you know, it's --
R:  Yeah, me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  There's so much, you can't keep track of everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when you start watching --
R:  And usually it's not good news anyway --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- so you just kind of get depressed. [LAUGH]
L:  It's never good news --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  And -- and people are funny because they -- they think that somehow or another we're going to have world peace and stuff like that, and it's like, it's a lovely concept but it'll never happen as long as --
