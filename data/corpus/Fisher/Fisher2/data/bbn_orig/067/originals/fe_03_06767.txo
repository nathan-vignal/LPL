R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE] Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE] My name is [LAUGH] Deanna.
L:  I'm Joanne.
R:  [NOISE] I'm from Utah.
L:  Okay and I'm from Georgia.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, cool. [LAUGH]
L:  So it's probably a little early in Utah?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's, um, about six fifteen.  Oh, no, no, five fifteen.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] What time is it there?
L:  Ah, seven fifteen.
R:  [NOISE] Oh wow, two hours ahead.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Wow.  [NOISE] Um, okay, so [SIGH] what changes since nine one one?  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, gosh. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I can't really say that I've, like, made changes myself but I definitely appreciate our freedom and I definitely appreciate the troops and, you know, everybody that helped to create that freedom for us.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Do you know what I mean?  I definitely have a -- way more respect for, you know, the families and the people that have to go out there and do that and -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I, um -- I think I'm just a little more, ah [LIPSMACK] -- ah, say like, um --
R:  [NOISE] Cautious?
L:  Well, cautious but just, ah, like more aware of, ah, what you have can just be --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- easily changed --
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  -- in a second.  Now do you have any, um -- you don't -- do you know anybody that was involved in that in any way?
R:  [NOISE] I don't.  I know nobody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  I knew some people that worked in the World Trade Tower --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  -- years ago.  Well, I'm not sure if they even still work there or anything.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they were just kind of, ah, sc- -- 'cause they were people that I were talking to -- was talking to through my job on a regular basis.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And I thought, "Wow, that's something", you know?
R:  [NOISE] It hit home. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, those are people I could have been talking to, you know -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- about the day before possibly.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So it's kinda --
R:  [NOISE] That's just [LAUGH] -- I know it's just crazy.  It -- like I don't know, like, I guess just sheltered from that kind of --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- thing, you know, until --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- it really happens, 'cause you just never think -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it will.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But then when it does, you're like, "Oh my gosh", you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Stuff could be taken away from you so quickly and it just -- it helps you appreciate things more. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Oh --
R:  [NOISE] And family especially. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I mean all those families that thought it was a regular day.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  It just that [LAUGH] would be the hardest --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- thing on the -- in the world to me.  I just don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] -- how I would personally take it if that happened to me as well.
L:  Mhm.  Now do you remember where you were --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when it happened?
R:  [NOISE] I -- yeah.  [LAUGH] I had just --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- gotten married the night before.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  Yeah, so it was quite a shocker.  [LAUGH] And we got woken up and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we were watching the TV --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and heard that, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they had gotten hit and [MN].  It was horrible. [LAUGH]
L:  So that would be for -- really forever ever etched.
R:  Oh, exactly.  I will never forget that day.
L:  Mhm.  I was at work and I don't all the time listen to the radio at work, but that day I was and they first said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "Oh, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Centre" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I thought, "Oh, okay".  Not really paying a lot of attention but I didn't -- didn't think about how big of a plane or anything like that and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- course as it went on a little bit more s- -- you know, and I thought, "Wow" and it was just kind of coincidental that that day I did listen to the radio and I [MN] don't often do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, yeah, I mean I was like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] after --
R:  I know and then -- then it was on like every single day after that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- and you just -- you're [LAUGH] just realizing you know, how lucky you are.
L:  Mhm.  Now have you a- -- have you -- have you ever had an opportunity to go to New York or ha- -- I have.
R:  [NOISE] I haven't.  I've never been there
L:  Now, I have been there pre, um, [LIPSMACK] ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pre September eleventh but not post.  Um, are you -- actually my family lived all up in New England so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?  Mine lives in Canada so I'm not --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- very familiar, like, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- with stuff --
L:  States, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- in the States.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] I've never -- so it's definitely [LAUGH] an eye opener when you're -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] I don't know.  [LAUGH] It's crazy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And my family --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- out there was really worried too, you know, because when they hear that it's in the States, they're just like, "Oh, no.  Are you okay?"  
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] We need to do a head check. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, it's like, I mean how far are you from there?  You know, like many, many, many States and -- but they -- they hear the -- like the area or some- -- you know, like my grandmother I think she was reading about Georgia.  She's like, "Is that near you?"  Georgia's pretty big. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.  As soon as they find out they're like, "Oh, no". [LAUGH]  You know, and it's like -- like millions of miles away it could be, you know, and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  They just right away --
L:  Right.
R:  -- suspect that you might be in it.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] And it's a huge thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Course that it touches -- you know, it just touches you'd have been aware though.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.  It does. [LAUGH]
L:  Now, did it -- I know one thing that, ah, think it changed, ah, just a little bit not a lot 'cause we live in a big Bible belt.  But, um, just that we go to church a little bit more --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- than we did.  Um, and of course I notice that too from other people that I knew who started going back to church --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  -- or -- or going back more.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just, um, looking for, you know, answers or something.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I'm pretty avid about going to church so it really didn't change my [LAUGH] --  I'm L.E.S. so I don't know if you --
L:  Mm Mm.
R:  [NOISE] -- never heard of that or --
L:  Mm Mm.  Mm Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, it's just Mormon or --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  So it wasn't -- I don't know, it -- it definitely just changed my outlook on family.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And makes you want to, like, you know, hold them closer. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  My -- yeah, and tell 'em every day, like, oh, how mu- -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I miss you, I love you and all that and --
R:  [NOISE] Everything that you took for granted before.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So, yeah, that was definite thing.  I don't know what -- what else would be --
L:  I think, um, just a general, um, you know, like you said, appreciation of the -- like, the -- all the military and all the -- just the volunteer --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  -- stuff and everything and --
R:  [NOISE] I really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- like, not that I would take it for granted ever, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I really didn't understand the magnitude of what they do, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And now it's like, "Holy cow". [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, and the number of people that --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, exactly. [MN]  And just [MN] exactly what it entails.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Leaving your family, you know.  Lot's of 'em had, like, children while they're gone which is horrible. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know, just a bunch of stuff.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  No and to end up with this mess now. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.
L:  Just kind of brings it all further close and then just to see that, I mean, it's possible that even as much an heightened awareness that it could happen again.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean, I think we'd be a little bit more [SIGH] -- wouldn't be as easy to happen again --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- but it could definitely happen again.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it very much could. [LAUGH]  It's scary that way because you think about it more. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And you're very aware of your surroundings, like, you know, and you hear about it all the time, people that aren't supposed to be here that are here or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- just [LAUGH] stuff that you wouldn't normally hear about, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Or it wouldn't cause much of a care [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] -- I guess.
L:  I think we just upgraded to status orange to not --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  That's scary and we don't even know why, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] That's another thing that's kind of [LAUGH] freaky to me that --
L:  I mean, stuff's happening and they're just not -- you feel like, "Are you telling us everything?  What do you know we don't?"
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  And they're like, "Oh, we're just doing it just for you know awareness", but I don't [LAUGH] think so 'cause there's a reason for it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Else they wouldn't have done it.
L:  Right.  I mean, yeah --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- you don't just go -- go in one day to work and go, "I think we should go to a different status today".
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.  Just -- just to be aware, you know.  
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Let everybody be aware.  I don't think so. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's kind of major. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.
L:  It's ki- --
R:  [NOISE] Not -- maybe not to them but, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, well, how do y- -- I think that the way that it was handled, um, by our, um, President was good too.  Um, I mean, I think that, I mean, as much as you could handle something like that.  And I really think that -- that mayor, ah -- gosh I can't think of his name right now --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, Guiliani --
R:  [NOISE] Um, Rocky -- Guiliani, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  He was awesome.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, very.  I think so too. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, to be just thrown in something like that.  That poor guy.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  
L:  He was just --
R:  [NOISE] He's definitely --
L:  -- wonderful.  And I don't know -- I mean, I don't know if other people could have matched that given the situation, but [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, and I -- I definitely am so thankful for our President too, because [SIGH] obviously [LAUGH] we wouldn't have had to do that if it -- if the President before him had taken the initiative to protect it, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Or to do what needed to be done.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] And he actually came in and did it. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] So that made a huge difference.
L:  Right, right.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I think so too, but, um, I think it would [MN] what -- it wasn't meant for this, but it'll quite boost to him for reelection.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  For sure.
L:  [LAUGH] Not that all of it was set up for that, but that doesn't hurt. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, no.  And that's -- like, you know, I just think about that.  Like if it wasn't for him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, then, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- none of that stuff would have gotten done.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Which it needed to be done.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] Sorry, I'm [LAUGH] -- we're moving right now so I'm --
L:  Oh --
