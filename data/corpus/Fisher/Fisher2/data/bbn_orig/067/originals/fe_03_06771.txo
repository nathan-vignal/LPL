L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is -- my name is Shanala. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Debra.  I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in California.
L:  I'm in New York. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, how are you?
R:  I'm doing good.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, I suppose, ah, things might be -- with the topic of the day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- might have a big affect on you.
L:  Yeah, um, I guess I'm in the mood.  Basically the only thing that, um, my husband and I might have changed in our lives is just like, ah, you know, gathering more contact, ah, information, um, you know, for, like -- I don't know I bought a whole bunch of, like, medical supplies [LAUGH] and all that stuff.
R:  Sure.
L:  Both of us, um, wanted to have, ah, um, extra bag, you know.  But it was good for -- anyway for, um, an extra emergency bag, you know, like, we're  -- like a spare pair of clothes and stuff like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that.
R:  Right.
L:  But I think that was also to do with the fact that I had a, ah, friend who had a fire and it would have just been good [LAUGH] anyway just to have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something.  Even if it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a --
R:  Yeah, I know what you mean. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, as you know you just grab and you just might be able to -- to walk, um, with, um, just in case of a big emergency.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean I figured I live in one of the upper boroughs, so if I ever had to -- I didn't -- I don't live in Manhattan so if I had to, um -- if something of a terrorist type was to happen, we figured that we'd just keep walking up north.  So, that's why I have a couple of emergency bags.
R:  Yeah, I know -- well --
L:  And --
R:  -- for me I, you know -- 'course where I'm somewhat removed from the immediate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, tragedy, but, um, I'm not too far from San Francisco --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so I, you know, think well, that's part -- could be a -- a target in the future and I think I'm just -- I just try to be more aware of people around me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And also, um, I think you said it -- it's contacts and, you know, knowing how to reach people and, um --
L:  Right, not to rely on the cellphone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause I think a lot of us have gotten to -- to rely -- rely on a cellphone, so --
R:  Mhm.  Um, but I -- I -- I -- it didn't really change my travel habits or anything like that.
L:  Right, and --
R:  I think I thought, well, if -- if something is going to happen, it's going to happen.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  That's pretty much how I figured it too and [SIGH] I mean but you -- have you had any experience with earthquakes before or --
R:  Oh, yeah.  So --
L:  Well, I mean you --
R:  -- we -- you know, I -- I -- we keep plenty of batteries and [LAUGH] --
L:  Right, so I mean -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- no where there's a radio and bottle bladder and --
L:  Like the --
R:  -- things like that, so --
L:  I don't think anyone could be prepared for something --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know?  Like what happened September eleventh but I mean -- but just -- I think you [SIGH] -- you still, um -- sound like you're more prepared than a lot of New Yorkers, I mean we had like a slight earthquake maybe last year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it wasn't -- you know, it was still like only Ma- -- mainly Manhattan felt it, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it was like a loud --
R:  We don't have 'em too often --
L:  Right, and then --
R:  -- but enough.
L:  -- there was one up in -- I'm sorry.
R:  That's okay.
L:  No, I was just saying that there was one, um, in one of the suburbs above us, that was maybe, like, three point something, but that's it.  You know, we haven't experienced a -- but supposedly we're overdue for one, but haven't experienced an earthquake in [LAUGH] you know, a couple of hundred years.  So I mean our buildings and everything are totally unprepared for -- and our mindset is unprepared for preparing for anything, you know, but then --
R:  Right, I don't think of New York as being earthquake --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- susceptible.
L:  No.  I do have to admit though, maybe like, ah, um, last month I did -- we did start looking at like preparation. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  We -- we have a [inaudible] you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, before the war started and all that stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just to have -- just to see what was out there.  You have little, like, packs for, like, a hundred and something dollars and you get, like, everything and water tablets and all that stuff, but, you know, [LAUGH] I never thought we'd buy it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Do you -- do you tend to keep in -- do you -- are you, um -- do you have relatives that live far away that you talk to more often now?
L:  Um, somewhat -- I mean, yeah, I don't think that has changed so much, um, pretty much the same.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I've always been the type of person -- the one who's -- kind of keep in touch with everyone, so --
R:  Right, same here.  Email a lot and --
L:  Yeah.  But, um, you know, just -- my -- my job has sort of changed.  They've had a little bit more fire drills and stuff than usual --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and stuff like that.  'Cause I work with kids.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um -- you know that's really the only thing.
R:  Yeah, I know my daughter mentions it once in a while still.  We were talking and --
L:  She lives out here?
R:  Ah, about September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, we were talking about -- we have an -- had an evening devotion about fears and things and she brought that back up again, and I didn't know she even still thought about it, but --
L:  Yeah, I mean there's certain things I still -- like sometimes if I hear a plane flying low --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it makes me think of that, you know, day so I mean --
R:  Yeah.  And that's something you never would have thought of before.
L:  Right.  But everytime I hear a plane flying low over my, um, apartment building or anything like that, I'm like -- I mean I'm up in the Bronx but still it's just a [LAUGH] -- just a feeling and --
R:  Yeah, well [LAUGH] --
L:  -- an association.  I'm like, is this -- you know, you try to -- you actually literally pause to see if it's going to continue --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- on [LAUGH] by.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's just --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- you know, and here it's like, you know, almost three years after the fact, so --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, so I mean that's -- but I haven't changed my transportation routes or anything, I mean --
R:  No, and we still --
L:  -- whereas in Manhattan they've still got to get around.
R:  -- we still take the plane and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trains and that kind of thing.  The metro- -- ah, the Bart subway trains, and --
L:  Yeah.  So have you been out here to, um -- have you travelled out to New York since then or ...?
R:  Ah, I've never really been in New York. 
L:  Oh, you've never --
R:  I grew up just outside of Washington DC though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've been to the Pentagon a number of t- -- my dad was in the army.
L:  Yeah, but you haven't, um, travelled up north?
R:  Not really, no.  I hadn't really been to New York, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been pretty well -- ever since my dad retired we've pretty much been in California for the past twenty years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, have you ever been out towards California?
L:  Yeah, I've been out to, um, S- -- um, San Diego and, ah, um, my -- I have cousins out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then -- and, um, I guess at the tip of Los Angeles.  We drove to, ah, Walt Disney, ah, land so --
R:  Sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's about us as much as I've been to, ah, Los An- -- that's the scope of my California experience, you know.
R:  Mm.  Well, that's more than my New York experience. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well you could see it from afar. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh man, so, you know, I mean you could do some more travelling but I haven't been able to.
R:  Yeah, my husband isn't much of a traveller, so and -- well I -- I should say one aspect where things have changed is my husband was supposed to be taking a, ah, business trip to, um, South East Asia, Phillipines, um, specifically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know that they've had a lot of, ah, terrorist activities --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- down there with kidnappings and stuff, and -- and originally I was going to be going with him.  We went once --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- before prior to September eleventh, um, and he was supposed to be going again and travel still hasn't been approved yet.  Partly because of that and partly because of the SARS --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- virus.  But -- so his business travel has been put on hold.
L:  I think if anything, I mean, that's what we're more concerned about [LAUGH] with right now. [LAUGH]  I mean --
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, so many -- we're so close to Canada and, you know, frequently people -- I know people who are Canadian and they travel up there and back, and I'm just like, you know [LAUGH] even though no-one here in Ch- -- supposedly no-one in Chinatown, New York, has, um -- had -- so, you know, SARS -- SARS-like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- symptoms.
R:  There's -- yeah, there's been very little of it in the US.
L:  Yeah, but I'm, like, New York City is like a really [LAUGH] big city, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, just, you know --
R:  Well, they added Toronto to the list again.  It was taken off --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and now they've put it back on.  So --
L:  You know --
R:  -- but, you know, that --
L:  -- they did actually -- they did -- oh, no, that was -- that was still in Toronto.
R:  Yeah, they -- they took 'em off --
L:  Um --
R:  -- and then today --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yesterday or today I read they are back on the list again for looking out for them, and not travelling.
L:  It's just such a -- I mean, New York City [NOISE] is just such a close knit community in terms of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the vast use of public transportation and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I'm just, like, if someone was to be walking [LAUGH] you know, with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something like that it so -- it could pass so easily.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I guess that's why they're so afraid about, ah, bioterrorism and all that stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause it could so easily happen.
R:  Well, especially with the subways, and --
L:  Yeah.  And, um, we have plenty of more subways than [LAUGH] you know, DC and, you know, so --
R:  Right.  Well, even San Francisco they do have a rapid transit, but [MN] it's nothing like --
L:  It's above ground --
R:  -- probably New York.
L:  -- though right?
R:  Um, parts of it. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [MN] Parts of it are underground and, ah, especially in the city itself.  And to go across the bay there's an underwater tunnel.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, so parts of it are underground.
L:  Yeah, it mean it still has a [inaudible] at the back of your mind that something eventually still will.  I mean there's --
R:  Well, especially, you know, they -- and they upped recently the --
L:  The terror alert, yeah.
R:  -- the alert to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- orange.  Yeah, so you kind of have to sit and pause and wonder.
L:  [NOISE] You know, if not this year, you know, some- --
