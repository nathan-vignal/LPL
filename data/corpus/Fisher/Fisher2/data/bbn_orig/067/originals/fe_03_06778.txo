L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  My name is --
R:  I'm Linda.
L:  What?
R:  I'm Linda.
L:  Linda?  I'm Drew.
R:  Hi Drew.
L:  And how did you find out about the Fisher study?
R:  Um, on a board on the internet, on the coupon board. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  What about you?
L:  Well, that -- I found out about it on the rebate board.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] rebate -- refunding makes sense.
R:  Oh, I've heard about that.
L:  So -- okay, I'll let you go first.
R:  Actually I haven't changed anything since September eleventh -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- since September eleventh.
L:  No, I haven't really.  I have flown once, twice -- once I think since and just -- no, twice.  Just the added security at the post -- at the post office [LAUGH] at the --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, airport that you have to go through.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And of course you have to allow time wise for that.  And then my c- -- when we go to college football games they won't let you carry in a big bag anymore or -- or the -- the weather is rainy or something like that and you're carrying in your rain stuff they want to -- they want to search the bags.
R:  Huh.
L:  And -- which is fine, I have nothing to hide.  So, um, but as far as anything else, I can't think of anything else that I have changed since then.  I mean, I always went to church so I mean it's -- it's -- it's not like, you know, it -- it sent me running back to church or anything like that.
R:  No, a- -- I haven't changed a thing since --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- September eleventh.  It just -- like it didn't phase me. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.
L:  And I don't --
R:  It's just another thing that happened.
L:  -- I don't know a- any- -- and I don't have any family, friends, connections of people that nine eleven impacted.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I don't either.
L:  And then, let's see.  I do have -- we do have friends that went up and worked in some of the soup kitchens --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and -- to feed the -- the rescue workers and that type of stuff.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] They -- one of 'em owns a -- a restaurant and his chain of restaurants donated food and he went up and worked some of it. [NOISE]
R:  Mm.  That was nice.
L:  Mhm.  And -- and then I have another friend that -- that just volunteered and went up.  His church paid for his, ah, trip.
R:  So do live in New York?
L:  [NOISE] No.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] I live in central Kentucky.
R:  Mm.
L:  And you?
R:  Indira[?], Illinois.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  
R:  Central Illinois.
L:  So [NOISE] but as far as, um [NOISE] -- and even when they changed [NOISE] the alerts to red, from orange to red or anything like that it doesn't -- it doesn't impact me in -- in that way.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Now at work they've gotten much -- on the computer.
R:  Mm.
L:  They've -- they've -- when -- if you go and you access the internet at -- at lunch or something like that, the controls are much tighter as to where you can go and where you can't go.
R:  Oh, really?  Mm.
L:  A- --
R:  Where are you working at and what do you do?
L:  The -- I work for a utility company.
R:  Mm.  Mm.
L:  So as far as, you know, where you can go -- but part of that is just, you know, they don't want you going to the -- to the casino sites and that type of stuff which I understand.  I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I care not to do that anyway.
R:  Mm.
L:  And anything else.
R:  Mm.
L:  And is this your first call, second call?
R:  This is my third call.
L:  Third call?  This is my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- second.
R:  How 'bout you?  Sec- second?
L:  One of 'em I did it -- did it Sunday afternoon.  One of 'em I initiated it.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it just happened to be someone else was online that was willing to take the other part and it turned out to be [NOISE] another person like you that had found out about it on the refunding board.
R:  Oh.  How do you initiate it?
L:  Ah, did they send you an email with a pin number?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I have to look.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  I don't know, they might have.  I just wait for them to call me.
L:  Well, there were -- they could call me the first week and they called me like three times.  And every time I was not -- I wasn't home.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I called -- I had a one eight hundred number that I got off my chat board and, um -- and called 'em and just said I -- I never -- I never received a pin number and I didn't receive my email with a pin number in it or -- and I would like to change my time.  I originally said eight o'clock and it turned out to be that just wasn't working. 
R:  Mm.
L:  So I wanted to change it to nine o'clock and they -- they called me --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- with my pin number and then they [inaudible] -- and then they sent me an email and it gave me the phone number --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was an eight six six number that I can call and initiate -- initiate a call.  If there's someone else that is doing the same thing, then you chat.
R:  Mm.  I have to [several inaudible words] they probably did send me it and I'll just have to find it.  I have -- I have thousands of emails. [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  Right, and they, um -- and I -- for some reason I've gotten on every spams list I believe. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- I go -- if it goes into my junk mail folder I delete it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think --
R:  I think this is a neat thing.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  I do too.
R:  You know, 'cause I -- I've got, um, ideal ideal is where I found out about it and --
L:  I'm not familiar with that board.
R:  Yeah, it's ideal ideal.  And then whoever, um, um, says something about it, they just ribbed her.  You know, said, you know, that stuff -- that kind of stuff isn't allowed and [MN], you know, I felt sorry for her but, um, I [LAUGH] -- I like it.  I signed up for it.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]  Well, the lady on our board that [NOISE] -- that, um, put out the information is a reliable source.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, and then also there's another one [NOISE] called deal hunters dot com.  Have you done that one?  
R:  I've seen -- I've heard about it.
L:  And then my coupons is another one.
R:  What is it?
L:  My coupons.
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  I ran into a lady in the grocery store that had the binder method. 
R:  Ah.
L:  Which way do you do your coupons?  Do you have a box or do you use the binder?
R:  A box.  I used to have a binder, ah, with the, um, ah -- with the programme on -- on the computer.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I forget what it's called.
L:  Well, this was -- t- they've come out with the -- somebody came up with the binder method where you take like a three ringed notebook that zips --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you put in like baseball cards or, um, photo album pages and you slide your coupons in those.  And you -- 'course you put 'em by category like you do your box.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you can open -- you open up your b- -- um, say you need shampoo, you open it up to that page and -- and you can see all your shampoo coupons that you have at a glance and you don't have to sift through 'em.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  I have a binder but I haven't taken the time to convert from a box to a binder.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I have never done the -- the programme on the computer. [NOISE]
R:  It was ki- -- it was really neat.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then you can download from the internet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the coupons, you know, with categories --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that are in the paper.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  I mean the categories and stuff they -- and they have numbers on it and you can put it in the binder that -- that you can buy for 'em and stuff.  So --
L:  [NOISE] Oh [NOISE] okay.
R:  It was really neat.  It was -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it was years ago. 
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  And -- and I have the coupon and -- and I can't find the, ah, programme anymore. [MN]
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] So -- and, um, one thing the -- the first call that I initiated -- Sunday when I initiated a call, I didn't -- neither me or my partner didn't catch the question.  And there's nothing on their menu that punch -- that you punch a button and say, "Repeat the question".
R:  Oh.
L:  We -- we missed the first part of the question and I didn't unders- -- I didn't understand what the person said.
R:  Mm.
L:  So anyway.
R:  Oh, I found -- I found the email.
L:  Okay.
R:  So I have it here.
L:  And so t- --
R:  I'll have to read it.
L:  -- and tomorrow say if you want to initiate the call, call that number and you put in -- and they'll ask you for your pin number and then that's how they know --
R:  Oh, here it is right here.
L:  -- who's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on the phone and so I hope I get to do five calls.  Some of 'em have just been able to do three.
R:  [several inaudible words] up to three calls.
L:  W- -- it says up to three but the lady that posts it where I heard about it said she did five.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm hoping for five.
R:  Well, I want to do it all the time.  This is fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Mm.  And you get another extra call.  Cool.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  But one thing nine eleven did do, it -- it made me appreciate my family.  So we saw the ones that were on the -- like on the -- on the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania that were ca- calling their fam- -- spouses on -- on their cellphones to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to talk to them.
R:  Mm.
