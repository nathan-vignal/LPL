L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah, hi.  Uh, my name's John.  Who are you?
L:  I'm Rachel.
R:  Rachel?  How're you doin' there, Rachel?
L:  Fine.  Do --
R:  Where're you calling from?
L:  Uh, North Carolina.
R:  North Carolina, uh.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  [MN] I be a Yankee now.  I be from Minnesota.
L:  Okay, [LAUGH] that's fine.
R:  Yeah, hope you don't have anything against Yankees?
L:  Beg your pardon?
R:  I said I hope you don't, uh [LAUGH] have anything against Yankees?
L:  Oh, I don't.
R:  Oh.
L:  I married one. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, anyway, so I guess we're supposed to, uh, talk about --
L:  Exercise.
R:  -- physical fitness, uh?
L:  Yeah.  Do you exercise?
R:  Well -- what's that?
L:  Do you exercise --
R:  Well --
L:  -- on a regular basis?
R:  [COUGH] Well, I do a lot of walking and I have a bicycle.  You -- you know, to be honest with you, Rachel --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Rachel?  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm not really fanatic about it.  I mean, I, uh -- you know, I don't -- you know, I've gotten to be the age where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've put on a coupla pounds.  I, uh -- [COUGH] but, you know, um, it's kinda, as I say, moderation in all things and I think, uh, you know, if you, uh, watch your eating and, uh, you know -- like I quit eating candy altogether, I mean, and peanut butter.  Peanut butter used to be one of my weak spots, man, I mean, like --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- at night I could sit down and watch TV and, boy, wipe out two or three of those babies without even blinking --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know but I quit doing that and that really makes a difference, you know.
L:  Well, I'm not a fanatic either but I feel like ex- -- exercise is really important.  I think one -- one of the most important things in maintaining our health.
R:  Well, you know, I think the important thing is to have fun doing it.  Don't make it a -- don't make it a chore.
L:  Well -- well, that's true, too but we should make it a regular thing.  I don't do it like I should.  I should get -- I've been wanting to get on a regular routine because that's one of the most important things in health, I believe.  If you don't use it you lose it.
R:  Well, that's true, too but --
L:  You're going to get stiff, you're going to tight and I've reached an age where I've found out that if you don't exercise you don't -- you lose it.
R:  Well, you know, it's interest -- uh, you know, though I may be an ass here, I think, you know, the thing for women these days is unfortunately somehow or another you guys gotten set up to a perfect standard.  You know, like somehow or another the contemporary woman's supposed to be perfect in all respects and --
L:  No, I'm not that way at all. [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, there is no such thing.  I mean, you know, perfection is --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- an illusion but, you know, the best thing you can do is -- to strive for is to do what you think is best for yourself, you know --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- and, you know, like I said, even taking a walk, you know, I mean --
L:  Oh yeah, that's important, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do that.
R:  I mean, I'd rather go out and enjoy a nice, you know -- nice [NOISE] --
L:  I don't think you have to run marathons or anything like that but just --
R:  [NOISE] No, you don't and you know --
L:  -- set up something regular that you enjoy, I agree.
R:  And, you know, that's the thing, as I say, you know, if there's, uh -- you know, it's just -- I think it's a balance, you know.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you exercise as much as you eat, you know.  If you eat more, well maybe you'd better exercise more, you know, and as I was -- you know, it's a funny thing, you're [LAUGH] the second person I've talked to about this today and, you know, the sad thing about our society is that our media [LIPSMACK] sends so many mixed signals.  I mean, you can watching commercials and one'll say, "Hey, you know, get down to Bally's, you know, get on that treadmill and work off all those pounds" and then ten seconds later you're watching a commercial from Pizza Hut, you know --
L: Yeah.
R:  -- telling you to, you know, get yourself [LAUGH] -- get yourself a big ole pizza, you know, and --
L:  Well, see I -- I don't look at it that way at all.  See, I'm not overweight at all and it's not because I've been exercising but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think it's important --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for your joints and your muscles and even mentally.  I was in the army and I ran every day and my men- -- my mental ability was better, I felt better, em- -- emotionally I was better.
R:  Wow.
L:  If --
R:  How long ago were you in the army?
L:  Oh, I finished in eighty four.
R:  Oh, are you --
L:  But --
R:  Are you still in the army now?
L:  No, huh-uh, I'm out now.
R:  Oh, well I guess --
L:  But what I -- but it's important not to keep your weight down [COUGH] but, like I said, so you'd be limber and use it, you know.
R:  Well, that's true, too.  But, you know, like I said, I -- I don't know.  You know, maybe it's different for women.  I -- I've always heard that it's actually harder for women to lose weight than it is for men, that, you know, men can actually lose weight easier than women do.  I don't know if that's necessarily true or not but, uh --
L:  I don't know if it's true or not, I'm not worried about the weight part, I'm worried about getting older and not being able to move around. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, that -- that's true, too, and, you know, the sad fact is that, you know, [LIPSMACK] this country is so divided down the lines.  I mean, we have people that are, you know [COUGH] like fanatical about exercise and then, unfortunately we have on the --
L:  Yeah, that's true much, you know.
R:  Well, then, on the other hand we have people that are -- we have, probably of all the countries in the world, we have the biggest problem with obesity in this country.  We have people that, you know, if -- if --
L:  Junk food.
R:  Yeah, and you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as I said --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you see TV, magazines, boy it just rams it right down your throat, you know, and --
L:  I know, it makes you feel bad.
R:  You know, I don't know, I -- I guess, you know, it's like the man said, moderation in all things, you know, and if you [SIGH] exercise moderately and you do it for your own needs, you know, hey that's cool, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't -- you know -- and, you know, any kind of exercise is better than nothing.  I mean, even going on walking is better than sitting there watching TV and eating a big bowl of microwave popcorn or something [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Yeah, do that for about ten years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sit there and watch TV and eat popcorn and don't ever exercise and watch your health go down the tube. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and, you know, here in Minnesota we have such short summers that you gotta get out and enjoy it.  I mean, just -- you know, we --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  We have -- sometimes can have brutal winters and, you know, to get outside and enjoy the summer night air, it's just beautiful, you know, and I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's really good for the soul, you know.
L:  When you walk, don't you feel better mentally?
R:  [NOISE] Oh yeah, definitely, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, you know, it, uh -- it's probably one of the simplest and one of the probably cheapest [LAUGH] exercises a person can do, you know, it --
L:  Well, they say it's better for your legs now, just to walk instead of running.
R:  Well, yeah, you know, and --
L:  You can ruin your legs that way.
R:  [COUGH] I mean, a good example of that, as I said, you know, talk about physical fa- -- fanaticism is -- is, uh, do you remember the guy by the name of Jim Fix? 
L:  No, I don't, mhm.
R:  He -- he was a world class jogger.  He was a -- like, a total fanatic on, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- jogging and exercise and unfortunately one guy -- one day the guy was out jogging and he had a heart attack --
L:  Whew!
R:  -- and, you know, it was [NOISE] kinda like, you know, um, a case of [LAUGH] -- you know, he, uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  He -- he kind of, uh -- he -- he went overboard on it and -- and I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's probably what the problem with the guy -- the guy had but --
L:  When I was in the army I was taking my final PT test with this girl, younger than me.  She died of a heart attack.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  They said her heart was beating so fast, getting to pump the blood out, you know --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and I think, yeah, there's a way of being a fanatic about it but, you know --
R:  Well, tell -- tell you what, just to get off the subject for a second, uh, what did you do in the army?
L:  What did I do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was a specialist, uh, administrative specialist.
R:  Oh.
L:  I worked in a PAC, personnel control --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  You know, [inaudible] personnel office.
R:  Were you ever over in the Middle East or anything or ...?
L:  No, huh-uh.
R:  Never over in the Gulf War or anything like that?
L:  I almost went to Grenada. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You did, uh? 
L:  Yeah, but I was getting out so I didn't reenlist.
R:  Do women have -- uh, do they actually have women in combat these days?
L:  Not really in combat.  It would have been set -- probably had set up an office or something there.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I don't know, you know, I -- you know, it's a funny thing, just, you know, like I said, it, uh -- you watch all those things about the war over in Iraq and, you know, it -- it, uh, seems like our army, boy we have all the latest --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- high tech stuff, boy.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, you name it, they have a weapon for it, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  I know it.
R:  It's impressive, it --
L:  Well, just like the little girl that was, [NOISE] um, captured, she was in, what, maintenance?
R:  Mm, I --
L:  You know, the ones that was captured in the -- [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Over there.
R:  Well, anyways, like I said, though, uh, so whereabouts in -- uh, North Carolina you said you're from?
L:  Yeah, North Carolina.  I live in Pinnacle, North Carolina. [NOISE]
R:  And whereabouts is that --
L:  Mm --
R:  -- in relation to --
L:  -- you know where Winston Salem is?
R:  Where?
L:  Winston Salem.
R:  Oh, okay, oh.
L:  'Bout thirty miles above Winston Salem.
R:  Oh boy, I bet you guys have beautiful autumns there, don't you?
L:  Beautiful ...?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Millions of people come to see our autumns. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And the Blue Ridge up there.
R:  Oh yeah, that's -- that's fan- --
L:  We've been having a lot of rain this year, though.  It's just ridiculous.
R:  Well, actually, we've had just the opposite problem [LAUGH] here.
L:  Really?
R:  We've had lack of rain but, uh, actually we were having a serious drought for a couple of months and then all of a sudden it started just pouring and it's kinda stopped again but, uh --
L:  Well, people here can't get their tobacco in the ground.
R:  What's that?
L:  It's one of -- they can't get their tobacco in the ground.  It's one of the main crops.
R:  Yeah, you guys live on that stuff.
L:  I can't get -- I can't get my garden planted, not, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Really -- it's really bad here.
R:  So, have you ever --
L:  Flood warnings.
R:  So, have you ever been to Minnesota?
L:  No, I haven't. [NOISE]
R:  You've never been to Min- ... oh?  
L:  [MN] I --
R:  Someday you gotta come up and visit us Yankees.
L:  I lived in California once and I drove all the way across -- back across the States.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't know if I went through Minnesota or not.  I went through a lot of States but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know -- you know, people have this idea that we still, uh, have outhouses and live in fish houses up here and --
L:  Well, I don't.
R:  Well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] actually Minnesota's actually -- I've lived here all my life and [COUGH] it -- it's a beautiful state.  We, uh --
L:  Are you from there originally?
R:  Oh, yeah, born and raised and, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I must say, it -- it's a beautiful state.  As I said, I've never -- never been to your part of the country.  I, um --
L:  It's beautiful country, too.
R:  Well, I'll have to do that one of these days --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh -- anyway, so, like I said, in conclusion [SIGH] I guess the best thing to do is, uh, you know, get out there and take a good walk once in a while and, uh --
L:  Not once in a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You need to set up a regular schedule --
R:  Well, actually, believe it or not --
L:  -- something you enjoy.
R:  Not to -- believe it or not --
L:  I used to go hiking a lot.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, not to di- -- divert from the subjects here but, you know, they say sometimes the best exercise is sex. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, that's true, too.
R:  Yeah, it is actually.
L:  They say -- no really, they say it, though, keeps you younger longer or something like that.
R:  Well, I don't know, you know, it's -- up here in Minnesota, though, long cold winter nights sometimes it's a survival instinct.
L:  Keeps you really busy, uh?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you gotta keep warm somehow or other, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  It's thirty below outside, man --
L:  God --
R:  -- you got to do something.
L:  -- you better be exercising.
R:  Anyways, so is our ten minutes up pre- -- pretty soon.
L:  They'll tell us or something.  They're supposed to tell us.
R:  Well, I tell you what, if you're ever in -- ever in Minnesota and you go to the Mall of America, look me up.
