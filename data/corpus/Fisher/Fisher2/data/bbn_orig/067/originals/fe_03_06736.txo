L:  Hi, my name's Eileen.
R:  Oh, hi.  My name's Paul.
L:  Hey, um, have you done this before?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  As I'm trying to get -- I'm trying to get it done before they call me again and I'm not around. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh, yeah they've called several times and I haven't been home.
R:  Yeah, so I just called in.
L:  Yeah, so did I.  Um, I do try and exercise.  Not so much, um, like set out to exercise, do a routine or anything like that.  Um, I play baseball four days a week and, uh --
R:  Oh, that'll do it.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's been working.  I just started that in April just with some Little League teams and coaching with them and so I've been really active with that.  Um 
R:  That's kind of a nice way to get exercise 'cause you get it without realizing it.
L:  It is.  It is and that's kind of what I've wanted.  I didn't wanna set out and do, you know, say, "Well, okay, every day I'm gonna work out for forty five minutes and this is what I'm gonna do".  I figured if it didn't seem like a chore then I wouldn't -- I wouldn't mind doing it all the time.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So --
R:  Well, that makes a big -- yeah.  Yeah, I like things like tennis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't -- I mean, I have played softball but it's been a really long time.
L:  Yeah.  Tennis is something I've never -- never played.  I've got two kids and they've gotten into it.  They wanna start learning how to play and I'm like, "Well, [LAUGH] can't teach you that one".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  We just kind of taught ourselves.  It was like, uh, I did it with I guess my kid brother and a couple -- like a friend or two from high school and we just -- just batted the ball around and got -- I got half decent at it but never got real good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I find it's a nice sport both for the exercise and for [SIGH] -- f- for limbering up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's good for my back. 
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't -- I don't know I'm not   I used to bowl like when I was --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- younger. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And that doesn't -- that's not, you know, too athletic.  So --
R:  It's some -- it's somewhat but not as much I guess.  It's a lot of -- a lot of work on one arm. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I had -- I had one t- -- I had one bowling alley that I did really well at.  Never -- never did that well anywhere else and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that place closed down.
L:  [LAUGH] That's the same thing that happened here.  I went there every day and I -- I did that for quite a while, was actually pretty decent at it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and then they closed down the bowling alley like five years ago, so   I mean, there's other ones in the area but that's the one that I grew up playing at and --
R: Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, liked but --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Where do you live?
L:  In Maryland.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.  I'm in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  You're up there[?].
R:  Well, it's even later for you then.
L:  Yeah, it's eleven fifty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, everything quiets down and then I make the phone calls 'cause it -- we have caller ID and I see that they've called twice today. 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.
L:  And they called yesterday and so I thought, "Well, I told 'em I'd be here and I guess I'd better make a phone call".  So --
R:  Right, and they probably tried to call me while -- my phone machine about twice a year misbehaves and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  What happened it w- -- this t- -- it usually misbehaves in such a way that it just doesn't take messages, right?  But this time it misbehave and it sort of picked up the phone --
L:  Oh, g- --
R:  -- and left the line up like, you know, like the phone was off the hook.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, people couldn't reach me for about twenty four hours.
L:  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And I was afraid to have the phone company ch- -- I assumed it was the phone company and -- but I -- then they said, "Well, if it's -- if it's your equipment it's gonna cost you". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But it just does -- see what goes on.  We have trouble with -- not so much with our phone line but with our computer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause we have a dial up service.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's exciting.
R:  Uh, well I have -- yeah, there's -- there's a couple of services that will take your calls and play them for you over the internet.
L:  Yeah, we have, um, we have Call Wave that does that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that's the only one that we've tried and that's just because I found that like a year ago and it was really pretty cheap.
R:  Yeah, that's the thing once you find one it's like d- -- as long as it works pretty well then you don't really need to switch.
L:  Yeah.  The message -- we don't have -- we didn't do upgrade or anything like that.  We didn't get a -- a, you know, higher service.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, ours is just a basic message.  Um, like we can't program what it says and it only holds it for thirty seconds.  So, people that call here they're -- they just, you know say, "Hey, this is so and so.  Call me back".
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  You know, 'cause after --
R:  So, that must be really inexpensive.
L:  Well, it's like a dollar fifty a month.
R:  Oh, that --
L:  It's just a charge on the phone to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- forward the phone calls to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- an eight hundred number.
R:  Well, that's really good.
L:  So, yeah.  It's just -- it's just, you know.  It saves us from having to get a second line or do anything like that.
R:  Right.  Yeah, 'cause the only -- sometimes what happens is I can't call someone back because I'm downloading.
L:  Right, right.  So, I usually just have my cellphone somewhere near me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that way if I'm doing something like that or if I'm doing a project on line I can call 'em that way.
R:  Yeah.  I don't have one of --
L:  But[?] --
R:  -- those yet.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I have mine -- it used to just be for emergencies but now it's just because it's a hassle for me to sign off line and then stop what I'm doing.
R:  Mhm, right.  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, but   Well, do you do anything?  Do you like anything --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- besides tennis?
R:  Well, let's see.  Well, yeah, 'cause I don't do huge amounts of that.  I like bicycling a lot.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got started doing that like when I was about fourteen and --
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I've always had a bicycle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I took my girlfriend bicyc- -- well, we just bicycled around her neighborhood but she's really out of shape and she got sore after we went about five miles.
L:  Oh, go- --
R:  And we were going really casually.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, just sort of pedaling around really slow just looking at things.
L:  Right.
R:  She got real sore so she's gonna -- she's -- at least she didn't say, "Oh, I can't do this again".  Her attitude was like, "Well, I guess I need to build up".
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, that's nice.
L:  Well, that's good.  That's encouraging.
R:  Yeah, 'cause what I -- I used to live in -- I grew up in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and --
L:  What part of New Jersey?
R:  Uh, right on the border of --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- Pennsylvania.  So, it was like Bucks County and Mercer County.
L:  Okay.
R:  And it was -- it's like nor- -- they're both like north east of Philadelphia.
L:  Okay.
R:  And wh- what I liked about it was that I could get on my bike and in about a mile or two I'd be out in the country.
L:  Mm.
R:  And here, you know, I have to throw it in the -- if I wanna get out in -- in an area like that where there isn't traffic I have to [SIGH] throw the bike in the car and go driving for a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we do have --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  We have a lot of lakes and there's, you know, bike paths and foot paths all along all the lakes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I can also do that.  But it's not -- it's not quite as much fun.  I really -- what I like is bicycling.  Just like, you know, you're getting exercise without thinking about it by playing baseball.
L:  Right.
R:  I get exercise by getting on my bike and going somewhere, you know, going act- -- to an actual destination, doing something and coming back so it's like real.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I have a friend who like doesn't even have a car and just bicycles everywhere.
L:  Mm.  I don't ever see how people can do that.  
R:  I don't know eith- --
L:  I just always -- I guess I think I have so many things in my car when I'm coming and going.
R:  Oh, I know.  I don't --
L:  That if I had to do anything, yeah I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how I'd do it on a bike.
R:  Yeah, 'cause she and her partner just plan their whole thing around not having a car.
L:  Mm.
R:  Except for very occasionally if they're visiting a relative then they'll rent something but --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- otherwise yes.  So, I guess between mostly bicycling but also I guess I suppose taking the bus.
L:  Right.
R:  But here -- this is not a good town for transit.
L:  Mm, no neither is ours.  It's terrible.
R:  [LIPSMACK] See but -- 'cause a lot of the Eastern Seaboard is pretty good.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  We have [NOISE] -- what do we?  We have like a light rail from here to Washington DC --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then, uh, you know, it goes of course to Baltimore and then Washington DC.
R:  Right.
L:  And then somewhere they have a subway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But yet nobody in the area has ever heard of it.
R:  That's strange.
L:  So, it's [NOISE] --
R:  You mean, this is not the same as the DC subway system?
L:  [LAUGH] What?
R:  It wouldn't be -- so, this is not the same as the Washington DC subway system?
L:  No, ours -- it's [NOISE] just -- it's in Baltimore city.  This --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, over a s- -- a really small area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I know people that have lived there for years and when you say, "Subway", they're like, "What subway?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I didn't even know it was around until just a couple of years ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's definitely not something --
R:  Yeah, it's strange [inaudible] --
L:  But this area we're like forty five minutes from Baltimore --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and here you could -- I mean, you could bicycle -- you wouldn't be out in the country but you're not, you know, downtown city either.
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's kind of   I mean, you could -- I could certainly see people bicycling to and from a store -- grocery store or something like that but not a lot of people do it.  We've got bike lanes.  I never see anybody on a bike.
R:  No.  No, in a town like Boulder you will.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But it's just -- it's -- it's -- it's partly culture I guess, you know, with -- you know, and how much it's caught on and who, you know, who gets attracted to a town and -- [SIGH] and when the bike paths get built, I suppose.
L:  Right.  See, we have them but we just -- a lot of people around here they run --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, I don't know, I don't even consider it walking. [LAUGH] They might as well just be standing still but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, they walk with friends or with headsets or whatever and --
R:  Yeah, [inaudible].
L:  Um, but --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- they don't -- nobody's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ever --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  -- much on the bikes.  It's --
R:  Right.  N- now I remember back east there wasn't a whole lot of cross country skiing either in winter.
L:  Mm, not any people that -- well --
R:  'Cause -- 'cause the- the- there's not -- there's not necessarily as much snow there.  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Although lately -- I got caught in that weird blizzard --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- several years back.  You know, when -- when it came up to your armpits.
L:  Well, we had one this winter too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That was insane I --
L:  Three feet of -- I mean, for us it was a lot.  For other places I'm sure it's probably nothing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, we were three and a half feet in some places and then --
R:  Yeah, that was just what it was like in ninety -- I guess it was ninety six.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I remember that one too.
R:  I was in -- I happened to be there on business and fortunately I was staying with a friend.  So, basically I got paid to goof off for, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- four days or something like that.
L:  Well, it wasn't too bad.  Now our summer's been the same way.  I mean, it's hard, you know, if you're doing anything outside --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's rained thirty seven out of the last forty something days.
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  Which is odd for us because normally in Maryland we're kind of
