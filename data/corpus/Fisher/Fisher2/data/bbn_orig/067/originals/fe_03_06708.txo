R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, uh, my name is Lynne.
R:  Hi, I'm Michelle.
L:  Hi, Michelle.
R:  And I'm from Minnesota.
L:  Oh, I'm in, uh, Fort Worth.
R:  Okay.  Um, what was the topic again?
L:  Uh, health and fitness.
R:  Okay, um, is there something specific we were supposed to talk about or ...?
L:  No, just whatever.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, along those lines.
R:  Okay, well, um, I'm a tennis player and I've been playing since I was a kid and I still do that for fun and I run, like, every other day.  How about you?
L:  Well, I'm, uh, quite a bit older than, uh, how young you sound.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm -- I'm twenty two so, yeah.
L:  I'm forty nine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, I've never been into jogging o- or tennis for that matter.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I've, uh, been a walker but that's about it.
R:  When you were younger did you do more sports or ...?
L:  No, uh, aerobics and walking has been it.
R:  Mhm.  Okay, do you well -- um --
L:  And then I injured my foot a couple of years ago and haven't even be able to walk so ...
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, what happened?
L:  Uh, I stepped in a hole and, um, uh, you know what the plantar fasciitis is?
R:  Um, no.
L:  On the bottom of your foot.
R:  Oh okay, yeah.
L:  It -- it's what a lot of people call bone spurs.
R:  Okay, okay --
L:  But really it has --
R:  -- yeah, I have heard of that.
L:  -- nothing to do with a bone spur but it's just the tendons on the bottom of your heel --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- tighten up to wear walking is painful.
R:  Oh -- oh so you have been to do -- can you walk, like, in a normal, like, everyday basis --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- just for work and --
L:  But if I try to walk for exercise then it -- it tightens those tendons to where then even just normal walking is painful.
R:  Oh, is there anything you can do about it?
L:  Well, there's a new treatment on the market, uh, that I'm right now waiting to see if my insurance company will approve --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's electro shock --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that somehow the shock waves help those tendons heal.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But my injury is so old that they -- I don't know if they can do anything for it at this point in time or not but anyway I'm just waiting for the insurance company to get back 'cause it's -- it's -- you know, like, [SIGH] over a thousand dollars for the treatment so ...
R:  Oh.  Oh yeah.  Well, it seems like it would be a necessity though for --
L:  Well, yeah, I mean --
R:  -- basic health.
L:  -- you know, 'cause I'm overweight and as far as, uh, you know, losing the weight, uh, at least the very minimal thing like --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- walking would be, you know --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- be about the only thing I could do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, then we're talking about, "Well, we'll just go on a diet" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which everyone wants to do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you probably don't have to worry about that so ...
R:  Not so far [LAUGH] but --
L:  Yeah, I didn't at your age either.
R:  [LAUGH] And I probably will in the future as everybody does so -- and -- and I'm only exercising now -- I just graduated from college and so it's an inbetween time where I'm at home and I'm waiting to go to my job and so I have a lot of free time on my hands.  Normally I exercise about once every two weeks [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Well, there's a, uh, a gal that's my cube mate at work and she's forty five --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, she still plays in tennis tournaments.
R:  Oh really?
L:  And, uh, she exercises at least four days out of the week --
R:  That's impressive.
L:  -- uh, she -- that's what she does for lunch on those days.  Well, I mean, she does come back and, you know, grab a bite but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- just at her desk kind of thing.  And, uh, yeah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so she goes out and works for an hour at least four times a day.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  I mean, not a day, I'm sorry --
R:  Yeah, a week [LAUGH] of course.
L:  -- a week, yeah.  Otherwise she wouldn't need to have a job --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she'd just work out all that --
R:  Aerobics instructor and what have you.
L:  But, um -- so, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, she does it at forty five so you could just continue to be that active for that long.
R:  Uh, I'm not normally this active.  I was -- I was active in high school and then in college it -- it fell off to just in the summer time and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and now [MN] I'm -- I'm -- actually I'm leaving the country in, like, a couple of weeks and so it's gonna be cold and unpleasant and I doubt I'll be outside and exercising at all for, like, the next year so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Where are you going?
R:  I'm going to London actually.
L:  Uh, you have a job?
R:  Yeah, um, I have a job with a refugee organization there so --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  But -- but it's freezing in London [LAUGH] so ...
L:  Well, not so all the time.
R:  Really, I -- I've -- I went there once and it was pretty cold then and so I'm just basing it all on that one time [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh okay.  No, they can -- they can have some real nice weather.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good.
L:  I -- I have a co worker that -- that, uh, works over the- -- I mean, he lives -- was born and raised over there, he --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know what they call them, they're calling us ex-pats but I don't know what they call them when they're Londoners working over here.
R:  Yeah, I have no idea.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But, um --
R:  Was he from the city or was he from another part of England?
L:  Oh, he's in the city.
R:  In the city?
L:  Yeah, he owns a farm there.
R:  Okay.
L:  But he works in the city.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, because I -- I've heard different things about different parts of the country.  I've heard like the -- the -- the north can just be, like, bitterly cold but if you get down to the south it's -- it's a little bit nicer so ...
L:  And that's probably only one time of the year too.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it extends so -- but, I mean, I should be used to it I'm from Minnesota so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I went to school in California though so --
L:  Oh okay.
R:  -- I'm not used to it right now and I've only been back in the summer.  But it's nowhere near -- my mom's in Florida right now actually.  Wait, Fort Worth is in Texas, right?
L:  Yeah, I'm in Texas.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But I was born and raised in Phoenix so ...
R:  Oh, Phoenix is even worse.  Oh, I've [inaudible] in Phoenix.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Oh god. [LAUGH] No, I was -- I was -- yeah, I was there, like, in March and it was already, like, boiling, you know [LAUGH], miserable.
L:  Oh, you were in Phoenix?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  For the, um, baseball.
L:  That's just spring there.
R:  Yeah, oh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I can't even imagine -- I've heard -- I've heard people describe the summer and I just think it's [inaudible] unpleasant, I never [LAUGH] wanna go there.  But people who, like, are born and raised there just love the temperature and they, like -- they are like --
L:  Until they leave.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Trust me.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I lived there twenty four years.
R:  And people rave about the night time, is -- is that the, like, lovely evening --
L:  Yes, after the sun goes down.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not even necessarily night but as soon as the sun drops below the horizon it's just not as hot.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, it still maybe over a hundred --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it just doesn't feel blistering --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like it does when the sun's up.
R:  Uh-huh.  No, I -- I don't -- I can't stand the intensity of like that --
L:  But the older I get the less I wanna, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- be in heat like that.  I would prefer cool.  In fact, uh, once it hits about eighty five or ninety I'm done.
R:  [LAUGH] Air conditioning.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't wanna be out in it past that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so going home's not pleasurable for me anymore unless I go back in the winter.  It's always nice then.
R:  Well, Texas isn't -- Texas is pretty bad too, isn't it?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't have it good anywhere you go.
L:  No, I still got the heat but, I mean, you know, if I had to drive in all that snow you get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, when it snows here we -- we just stay home.
R:  No, I know.  No.  It's the same though in Cal- -- I -- I mean, sure raining 'cause it rains a lot here too and then in California when it would rain, like, it would just shut down, like, the road, people would be driving like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- five mil- -- it was just frustrating 'cause I -- I don't think it's that bigger deal but, like, everyone else I know is refusing to go out and drive in the rain so ...
L:  Well, they have so many mudslides and stuff there and -- and is in Arizona too when it rains, uh, it's cletchy[?] soil --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it doesn't absorb water so if they get, you know, half an inch it's like a flood.
R:  Yeah, this is true.
L:  And, uh -- but, you know, where you're at -- and -- and where I'm at, my god, uh, we get, like, thirty five, forty inches of rain a year and Phoenix gets four --
R:  Oh, oh --
L:  -- a year.
R:  Yes.  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] So -- and I have no idea how much y'all get but with all the snow and everything I'm sure it's quite extensive.
R:  Yeah, I know, it's quite a bit this winter but it's actually been raining all this week so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Oh cool.
R:  [SIGH] Another reason I haven't been exercising lately [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that'll keep you indoors.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you can't -- can't do tennis or jogging very well.
R:  [LAUGH] In the -- yeah, no we've a treadmill downstairs so -- 
L:  Downstairs, okay.
R:  [MN] Mhm.  But, um, I mean, was there, like, any other specifics -- have you done any of these calls before or is your first one?
L:  Yeah, this is my third one.
R:  Oh, it is?  Okay, this is the first time --
L:  Yeah, I've gotten --
R:  -- I've had one.
L:  -- bold and brazen and in called in my last two times.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah, 'cause I just could never seem to connect with the computer when it dialed me up.
R:  Oh, yeah, I know -- yeah, this is my first time and I just called in to do it.  I didn't even attempt to do the other one, I don't know when I'm gonna be home so ...
L:  Well, calling in's the best way to do it then you can do it at your own convenience and so far they've always matched me with somebody.
R:  Okay, that's good, that sounds easy.
L:  So -- and it's always been females so [NOISE] you don't have -- you know, not only is it a stranger and a strange topic but that you don't have a gender difference either so ...
R:  [LAUGH] What -- what are all their topics?
L:  Oh gosh, there was quite a few of them, there's probably about twenty five or thirty of them, I think.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Oh yeah, a wide range.  Pets, um, oh, yesterday was, um, uh, security restrictions or something, uh, and I wasn't really sure what that was gonna be about so I didn't bother.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I did one on, um ...
