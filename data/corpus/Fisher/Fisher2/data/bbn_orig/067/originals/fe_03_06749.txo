R:  [SIGH] Delia
L:  H-
R:  White.
L:  Hi, this is Patty Barton.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  Hi.  Where are you from?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, Burbank, California.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm Florida.  We're really --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- opposites. [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Have you changed any since, uh, nine eleven?
R:  Well, I'm --
L:  Any --
R:  -- much more aware of -- of, uh, security and things.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, we don't -- we don't head for the airports or any- well, we didn't travel a lot, but [MN] we decided we're not going to travel through the air anymore --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I have a lot of relatives in New York.  My, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- cousin's daughter watched the building go down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it just gives you a different outlook on life. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it sure does.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it doesn't really change your everyday life, it just changes your f- like, plans that y- for me it just changes plans, you know, like --
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] 
L:  -- future plans, [MN] you know, travel and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] How I do it and all but --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] you know, there's nothing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and we don't live far from, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- an [MN] [NOISE] [MN] -- an atomic plant --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- over in Crystal River --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sorta, like, gets me a little nervous. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, but   How are you -- how about --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you're early over there, we're six o'clock. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's, um, [NOISE] three o'clock --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- three --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- ten, right here. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause my cousin lives in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- San Francisco, so I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- usually talk to her, so [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] At night. [SIGH] Yeah --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, actually --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I have two young ch- anything else?  Oh, well.
R:  [SIGH] Well, um, I just, [NOISE] you know, [SIGH] if, uh, there's anything unusual or anything, I guess I would report it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know. [SIGH] [NOISE] Um, I don't really see [NOISE] [LAUGH] much difference in that, though, you know. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, same here, that's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when it first happened, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I work for hospice --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and they put all kinds of bulletins about, you know, receiving mail and sending mail and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, but --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, because of the, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the post office problems, you know, so [MN] --
R:  The anthrax?
L:  Yeah, so they always --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- th- they had all kinds of bulletins --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- posted but [SIGH] nothing really ever changed --
R:  I get a lot of mail and, [SIGH] you know, I -- [SIGH] uh, that don't really cross my mind.  I guess it should, but [LAUGH] -- yeah.
L:  It's never bothered me, I'm like, "Who's going to send --" you know, I mean, I could see if it was somebody not [MN] [SIGH] -- not just the normal, everyday, run of the mill, go to work, come home person, you know, it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- famous people or politicians and stuff, [MN] I would, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but who the heck's going to bother Pat Barton over in Beverley Hills, Florida, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] Well, it's like that lady, [SIGH] uh, I don't know why they sent it to her, uh, up in, I think it was, like, Buffalo, New York or somewhere --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the one that [SIGH] died?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Uh --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, it was just [MN] kinda random and -- and, uh, [SIGH] you -- you know, you never know, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] uh, she was really nobody, you know, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they [LAUGH] just sent it to her. [SIGH] But, um, I don't think about it that much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If I would see a white powdery substance, yeah, I'd get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'd freak, you know, and I'd [SIGH] call, uh, some hospital or something, but [SIGH] other than that, I mean, I don't see anything.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Yeah, it hasn't really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I guess it affected more the people who have family there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or who lived right around there or worked there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] but, um, [SIGH] things tend to, uh, [SIGH] go in the distance after a while.  You know, it's always in your mind --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because it's --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's always there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] but you tend to, not forget, but you ten do --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- put it [MN] on the back burner, anything like that.
R:  [SIGH] It's like when they give the high alert, the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] or orange, [SIGH] a- and, like -- like, Jay Leno says, "What are we supposed to do?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause they don't tell us what to do --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then they, [SIGH] uh, that -- it -- that was so stupid about that duct tape and, uh --
L:  Oh, the -- oh.
R:  -- oh, and that w- and plastic, it was weird.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] You know, 'cause that's not going to, [SIGH] uh, do anything.  If there was really biological, uh, warfare out there [SIGH] it would g- [NOISE] -- it would get to us somehow.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I mean, unless you have those masks, those expensive masks that [NOISE] -- [SIGH] that only the cops have.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But you know what?  By the time you heard about it, I mean, it would be in the air, on your skin, in your house.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- in the water.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Right.
L:  I mean, you can't prepare for that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- y- um, I don't think you can, I mean, not --
R:  No, [SIGH] no but, uh --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- millions of people, I don't --
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- see how, [SIGH] and if it was widespread, if it -- if it was the, you know -- a huge --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, like [SIGH] -- like the -- your power plant over there.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, like, if it was --
L:  That's scary.
R:  -- a huge thing like that.  Yeah, it is.
L:  But if anything happened, [MN] you know, [SIGH] what do I do?  W- we're over ten miles away, but the effects will go hundreds of miles --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- because the air currents --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- carry it. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so like -- and they have so many atomic plants and so many -- you think -- you wouldn't be that far away anywhere, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, if they wanted to get anybody, they're going to get 'em.
R:  Mhm, [SIGH] I don't --
L:  I mean, they have no -- no qualms.
R:  I don't know if they have that sophisticated enough stuff to do that, unless it would be something like a power plant that they would, [SIGH] uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- target, you know.
L:  Yeah, but they [MN] -- they use their people as bombs, you know what I mean?  And they don't have -- they have no, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- use for life, you know what I mean?  They -- they think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they're doing this -- all this evil, they think they're just doing it, um --
R:  [LAUGH] Or for their --
L:  -- for the good of god, but --
R:  vir-
L:  -- what god wants --
R:  -- for the virgins they want. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. [LAUGH] W- what god wants you to go kill people, you know --
R:  [SIGH] Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, that's just [NOISE] theological.
R:  Oh, they're just brainwashed --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, been that --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
R:  -- way all their life and [SIGH] -- and it's always the -- the kids that are brainwashed and then they go out and do it.
L:  Right.
R:  And then the parents say, "Oh, I'm so proud".
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Remember that -- do you remember that one guy, and his father said, "I'm so proud of him"?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, [SIGH] how sick.
L:  Sick, you have to --
R:  [SIGH] That he blew himself --
L:  -- be sick to do --
R:  -- up and blew a bunch of other people up --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he's proud of him.
L:  You have to be sick to do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When y- I mean, no normal person [MN] --
R:  Well, that's how their -- their mentality is, that's how they --
L:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Well, look at the kamikaze pilots in world war two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they flew their planes into ships thinking --
R:  R-
L:  -- they're doing good.
R:  Right.
L:  They weren't -- y- and they never taught them how to land --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so --
R:  Oh, [LIPSMACK] really?
L:  Yeah, they didn't learn how to land.  My husband's a world war two buff [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, they never taught 'em how to land, all they did was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they basically taught 'em how to fly, take off and fly [NOISE] and to dive, you know, but they never actually taught 'em --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- how to land a plane.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  They just taught 'em the controls and h- what to do, right? [LIPSMACK] So, all these boys died, for what?  You know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] killing people.  I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I hate war --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I hate anything to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do with war, you know.
R:  [NOISE] It's horrible.
L:  And I w-
R:  It's like, you know, well --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- you know, you can't -- uh, that's the thing [MN] that bothers me is that [SIGH] this, uh, [SIGH] weird sense of patriotism that [SIGH] you can't speak your own mind if you're against the war. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That really got to me.
L:  We get a lot if that in the newspaper her --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- where they're complaining about, um, people, you know, anti war --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm not for the war, and I don't think our boys should have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] died, um, if he really knew there were mass destructive weapons and he really knew -- [SIGH] people keep saying it's all -- he did it all for the oil, you know, but, [SIGH] uh, even losing one boy -- w- one soldier's too much to lose.
R:  Yeah. [COUGH] 
L:  I mean, I -- I -- I'm not a war -- a war person, but, um, I d-
R:  Oh, I like what Michael Moore [SIGH] had to say when he accepted the Oscar, he said this is a fictitious president and a fictitious war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] because it's -- it's -- uh, he was -- he only did it to get even [SIGH] for his dad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what -- and he said so in the beginning and -- [SIGH] and, uh -- but people can't speak their minds anymore like they used to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And they -- and they're [MN] branded a traitor, I don't think that's right.
L:  [SIGH] Well --
R:  Like the Dixie Chicks.
L:  -- [NOISE] I don't like the father, I don't like the son and we have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the -- the other son is -- his -- the president's brother --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is our governor.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah --
L:  Worst piece of garbage ever.
R:  -- he's the one that fixed the -- fixed the, uh, votes to get, uh, George in.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] and don't you think [NOISE] he -- I mean, he is the biggest liar. [SIGH] He comes up with all kinds of, um -- [LIPSMACK] oh, he says, [SIGH] "We want the schools to be smaller so the education --" this was -- all his whole campaign was about education, small classrooms, more money for schools, right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] And when he got voted in, the people got upset because he raised our taxes +exorbitantly -- exorbitantly. [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  -- anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so what happens is, he got on TV and he says, "Well, I want w- what the people wanted.  I never said a work about it".  You know, I mean, that's a bunch of bull, you -- point blank, that was your whole cam- campaign.  You liar. [LAUGH] Y?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And --
R:  Oh they're -- the Bushes are bad, you know. [SIGH] 
L:  Hey, they put us --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- out of business.  We had a business in Tampa, [SIGH] and he gave all his friends all kinds of, um, [LIPSMACK] concessions to move to Florida.  You know, they didn't pay taxes -- big companies, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, [SIGH] like, say my husband had a twenty five dollar a year tax to sell milk, right?  Well, that went --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- up to twenty five hundred dollars. [SIGH] Another tax went from forty dollars to four thousand dollars, you know, because -- where was the money going to come from?  If you have all your little friends [SIGH] you know, with all these big businesses not paying taxes, who's going to pay the taxes?
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  The little guys --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, they literally put my husband out of business.
R:  I --
