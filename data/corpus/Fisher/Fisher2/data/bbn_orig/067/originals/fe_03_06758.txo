R:  [SIGH] Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Where are you from?
L:  Uh, this is Jody, I live in, uh, Minneapolis.
R:  Okay, I'm Glory and I live in Texas. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, great.
R:  [MN] [SIGH] Yeah. [SIGH] So, what kind of changes have you made, or -- [LIPSMACK] since --
L:  Boy, I was just thinking about, I'm, like --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I don't know that we really did too many changes.  Do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  How about yourself?
R:  [SIGH] Well, [LIPSMACK] we're, uh, in the seniors and, uh, [SIGH] we decided it was time for us to [SIGH] leave where we were living before and where we  [MN] -- we moved closer to our children. [NOISE] 
L:  Okay.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [MN] mainly because of that, because originally we are from New York. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] And, um, [LIPSMACK] our son had lost a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- friend in the, uh, [SIGH] September eleventh, and we decided, you know, you -- c- family's too [SIGH] far away [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's time for everybody to be together and [SIGH] --
L:  Very good.
R:  -- so we made -- we made drastic changes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, wow, I guess. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] [SIGH] Okay.
L:  So do you like -- like it down in Texas, or ?
R:  [SIGH] It's, um, hot. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, with [NOISE] the humidity?
R:  [LAUGH] That it -- [SIGH] no, they -- it's no -- like, no humidity --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- where we are.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We're in Dallas. [SIGH] But, um, it's hot.
L:  The temperatures are high. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] But, you know, it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] um, but -- uh, that really --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- spurred us on, it made us make a big decision.
L:  Right.
R:  So, uh --
L:  Wow. [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I -- I can't claim that, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Oh.
R:  It's, um -- [LIPSMACK] but I -- I think it's affected everybody's life, um, since then.  You know, it's, uh -- since the --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- tragedy happened.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, I mean, I don't know whether you have young --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- children or older children --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but, uh, [SIGH] ours are grown, married, and, um, [LIPSMACK] it's just changed everybody's lifestyle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, a lot, for us. [SIGH] And, um, I know my son was traveling -- [SIGH] um, one of them was traveling around the world [SIGH] at the time and he stopped doing that. Um, [SIGH] he decided it was also time for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- him to settle down and have a family. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  So, you know -- so, a lot of good came out of it.
L:  Right, sounds like it.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  I mean, for you, you know.
R:  [SIGH] Uh-huh, [SIGH] and I w- [SIGH] so, you say you haven't -- really haven't had any changes?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, not really.  I mean, we just kept our s- you know, [LIPSMACK] same things that we were doing and stuff. [SIGH] Um, [SIGH] I think it makes you think about things a little bit more.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I guess for, I -- I think [SIGH] you stop and think about what you have and a little more thankful for the things you have.
R:  Right, [SIGH] absolutely.
L:  You know, and like, you said, your -- your family and -- and things like that, but [SIGH] I've always been close with my family, though, so, [SIGH] um, it didn't change that type of thing for me, [LIPSMACK] but --
R:  [MN] Did it change anything for y- the rest of your family, or --
L:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] You know --
R:  -- kept it pretty much [SIGH] --
L:  -- yeah, not really.  I mean, we -- I honestly, I guess I didn't know anybody that [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] that was involved in it or anything like that, [SIGH] um, personally.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I guess the only thing that it has affected us as a result is [NOISE] in the war.  I h- I do have two brother in laws over in Iraq right now.
R:  Mm, well.
L:  So, I feel like we've kind of gotten the after effect, you know what I'm saying?
R:  You sure have. [SIGH] 
L:  And, uh, it -- and that's really been a change so -- my-- and that's on my husband's side and [SIGH] I don't think, uh, [NOISE] that side of the family had really thought about family quite as much.  Uh, my family side they're all close, but his isn't, [SIGH] and, uh it's made 'em --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- especially his parents kind of wake up and go, "Oh", you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Now that they two sons over there, and my husband just got out of the army, so, I mean, he can't --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you know, let -- hi s unit can't -- I mean, he can't go with his unit, [SIGH] but it made him really stop and think, you know.
R:  [SIGH] Wow. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, maybe down the road, [NOISE] not, uh, initially --
R:  Not initially.
L:  -- like it's --
R:  But, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  not initially quite like it did for you, but --
R:  Ah. [SIGH] 
L:  -- um, like I say, the after effects you might say. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Okay.
L:  So --
R:  [SIGH] And your brother in laws are safe, hopefully?
L:  Yeah, s- the last we knew. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, well, you know --
L:  [SIGH] Ah.
R:  -- every day is [LAUGH] another day for them and it's, uh --
L:  Well --
R:  -- importance.
L:  -- yeah, I'll tell you, you know, they, uh -- they both called home on mother's day and -- and my mother in law wasn't home but at least they both --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- left messages and [SIGH] so we say, "Well, [LIPSMACK] you know, we heard their voices, we know they're safe".
R:  Thank goodness, yeah.
L:  From -- from that standpoint, but, uh, [SIGH] we did get a letter back from one of my brother in laws and he had been shot at by a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- sniper over there --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- when he went into Baghdad --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- so, [SIGH] you know, that it's not over, you know, and even though we don't hear about it on the news and stuff all the time, it's still going --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on over there.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Oh, absolutely.
L:  You know, [SIGH] so we always just keep saying, "Well, no news is good news right now". [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Y- yeah, I guess you really have to think that way.  That's a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I know, uh [SIGH] -- like I say, w- when, um, this happened in September eleventh, our s- youngest son was in Australia and there was no way --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he could contact --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- his friends --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, uh, until he heard we were able to contact the family and we found --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- out that [SIGH] his, uh, friend -- he was his roommate in college [SIGH] --
L:  Oh. [SIGH] 
R:  -- had died and it was, like, "Oof" you know. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  So, it's, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and it makes -- it made them stop and think a lot too--
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they -- I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] the children finally realized that, um, "Hey, mum and dad go to synagogue every week, maybe we --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- ought to join 'em once in a while". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] You know, it's, uh [NOISE] [SIGH] -- th- they stopped with their busy, busy lives a little bit and slowed down.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] Which I think is very important.
L:  Yeah, that's great.
R:  So, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [COUGH] and they -- otherwise, really, I really don't know what changes we would have made, [SIGH] um, or how it, uh would have affected us differently.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] I guess it just spurred us enough to say, "Okay, this is it, we're going to do it". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, sometimes [NOISE] we need that little [NOISE] push, don't we? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, oh absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, you sound like you have young children
L:  [NOISE] Uh, I was just going to say.  Can you hear?  I've got a three year old and a one year old, so  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, how wonderful.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I've got two little boys myself, so [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- pretty busy house, but  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Yes, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  [SIGH] but they're wonderful days and every day is --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- very precious.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  Very, very precious, so --
L:  [NOISE] I'll tell you it's amazing what they -- yeah, [NOISE] know at those ages and -- and just kind of take in, you know, and some days I'm so [NOISE] exhausted but I look at 'em and go, [SIGH] [NOISE] "You're just wonderful anyway". [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, absolutely.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  I say -- as I say --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- every day is so precious --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and they grow up so fast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And leave home so fast. [SIGH] It's a --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- a blink of an eye and they're gone.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Well --
R:  You know.
L:  -- it's, like, man, already, you know, the baby is walking.  I can't call him a baby anymore. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Walking, running, getting into everything. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH] So 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, that's great. [SIGH] Have you done many of these surveys?
L:  [SIGH] This is my third one.
R:  Okay. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, this is my third one 'cause every other time they called, um, [SIGH] for the third one, they couldn't find somebody --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to have me to talk to. [LAUGH] 
L:  OH, okay.
R:  [SIGH] So, uh, [NOISE] I don't know how many more they have.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I think you -- you get a limit of three [NOISE] [SIGH] unless you have, like, [NOISE] multiple phones or something [NOISE] you -- like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you have a cordless or a [LIPSMACK] cell phone [NOISE] or a business phone [NOISE] or something like that, [SIGH] so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I've -- it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- been real sporadic.  It's been a while since I've had one, so 
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it has been a lo- a while --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, I guess that's why they called earlier in the day this time. [SIGH] um, they've been calling a lot on weekends.
L:  Yeah, that's when I've had my other ones too, that's why I was kinda taken aback when this [LAUGH] one came --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- in. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- yeah, okay. [SIGH] No, I was just curious, because I didn't know, um -- [SIGH] I -- I had understood that they -- they could go, uh -- get up to ten.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  so I really wasn't sure how -- what anybody else --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I wasn't --
R:  -- got out of 'em.
L:  -- yeah, I wasn't real sure, 'cause I heard three and I thought I had heard maybe more.  I -- another person I knew said, well, no, she did more, [SIGH] but then I thought in the thing you read through it was if you have another phone [NOISE] and so I didn't really know how it worked, I'm like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- "Oh, I'll just sign up and I don't know, if they call and I have --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- time, I'll do it". [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, [LAUGH] with all of us --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- if you have time you do it and that's [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] right.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [SIGH] So, um -- and that's good, though, [LIPSMACK] uh-huh. [MN] Um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- have you started co- uh, saving any of the, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] things --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um, the -- from September eleventh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- any pictures or memorabilia --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- that you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, newspapers that your children --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- can look at later on in life?
L:  Yeah, actually we did.  We saved the newspapers and now, like, different things with the war, [SIGH] um, some of the bigger headlines.  I saved all those newspapers, [SIGH] and I'm going to save the letters that we get for our -- [MN] from my brother in laws because I think that's just real precious for the boys, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we'll just have those. [SIGH] Especially like this one we got where he was telling us how he got shot at and getting his [MN] vehicles out of Baghdad and [SIGH] actually, uh, today is his birthday, twenty first birthday --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- over in Iraq.
R:  Mm.
L:  How is that for a birthday? [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] I can think of other places I'd rather be, but --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I think he probably would too, but, [SIGH] you know, what was really neat is -- actually this brother, um, the youngest one that just turned twenty one today, he -- he really did not want to go, I'll be honest, he did not, [SIGH] and he got his letter back, but you know what?  He was driving one day and -- and there were some kids along the side of the road and they were cheering him on and he wrote back and he was like, [SIGH] "You know what? [NOISE] then I --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- decided it w- you know this is where I need to be, and I need to be doing my job and stuff". You know, [LIPSMACK] so --
R:  Absolutely. [SIGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] so that -- that was really good for him, I'm glad that happened with him [SIGH] y- you know, just because he needed something --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like that to solidify why he was there.  He kind of was questioning it, and some of it's his age and stuff, but [NOISE] and then his -- [SIGH] my husband's [NOISE] other brother, actually he [NOISE] goes in and he does [NOISE] water purification [NOISE] I guess. [NOISE] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] So, he goes, kinda -- he's in Kuwait [NOISE] but he's been going across the border in Iraq and helping with purifying the water and stuff [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  Well, they're not much safer.
L:  Yes, so that's --
R:  [SIGH] That's --
L:  -- the last we've heard anyway, you know, [SIGH] 'cause --
R:  [MN] [SIGH] 
L:  -- they can't really say too much --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- you know, [SIGH] where they're at and really too much of what they're doing or anything, so [LIPSMACK] yeah --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we just kinda [SIGH] put 'em in god's hands, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Absolutely. [SIGH] Well, you know, any of that stuff that you have, [SIGH] um, I would suggest that you laminate the newspapers. [SIGH] Um, we pulled some old newspapers out from when Kennedy was shot --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they were crumbling.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I was so upset [SIGH] but -- and then things that I --
