R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Kay.
L:  And I'm Kim.
R:  Okay.  Um, [NOISE] well, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I live in Manhattan, uh, [LAUGH] so --
L:  Oh, wow [several inaudible words].
R:  And I was here on September eleventh, so, um, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where are you from? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] I'm in Ch- -- right in Chicago.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So definitely --
R:  I'm from Minnesota originally, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I'm a mid +westerner at heart. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so I guess I can give you my perspective, or what I saw when, um--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I was on my way to work.  Actually I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- saw the first plane on its way [LAUGH] to crash into the first tower.  [NOISE] And, I mean, I remember --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [MN] And I remember saying [LAUGH] something.  I was walking with someone and they as- -- I said, "Jeez, what an idiot" you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "He's too close".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, then I -- I got on the subway and by the time I got to work, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the only reason I knew right away is, um, some guy was on his cellphone and he said, "Something -- something hit the Trade towers" and he was cursing because all of his business was [LAUGH] down there.  And -- and no one knew exactly what was going on.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Um, so that was kind of [LAUGH] my, um -- my experience as --
L:  Right.
R:  -- far as, um --
L:  Did you know anybody?
R:  Um, no. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Actually, um, you know, I know people who knew people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Of course. [NOISE]
R:  And, [MN] you know, it -- I just think there for the Go- -- grace of God go I because I've been, ah, down there so many times with friends and [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they come into town they want to see it and -- and, like, I think it was in July one of my girlfriends had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- come up for the weekend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we were down there, I mean, literally. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you know --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it was pretty fresh in my mind 'cause we sat on the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- river and, you know, had a couple of drinks and dinner and that kind of thing and -- and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when -- when they were all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gone it was just so [NOISE] weird.
L:  Yeah, it had to be.  [NOISE] Yeah, completely.  I mean, that's such a big part of over there, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, um -- yeah, I mean, down there it's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the businesses are ac- -- are really struggling and they're trying to get people back down there 'cause they lost all the employees of -- in the towers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And a lot of them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have either moved [MN] somewhere in Manhattan or, um, some of 'em moved to New Jersey.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  Whereas they all used to be in one big [LAUGH] --
L:  In one big building. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or a couple of buildings.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm sorry I'm kinda monopolizing the conversation, so --
L:  That's okay, that's okay.
R:  [NOISE] Um, so what was your ...?
L:  Well, I guess, um, I didn't know about it for a long time.  I was in college at the time and, ah, they had a little -- I was in an aerobics class [NOISE] and they --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- they had a little announcement.  The owner or the President of the college said, you know, something serious happened.  They said, "We don't really know what's going on and yah de yah.  The President's going to speak", and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're like, "Okay, whatever".  We didn't really think much of it and, ah -- and I'm not really much of a news person.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't watch the news, I don't listen to it.  So I left school, you know, I went home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I was getting ready for work, it's like four o'clock now, still don't know what's going on. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  I had an- -- messages on my machine, people calling me, but I didn't listen to 'em.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And so I get to work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and everybody's all [NOISE] kind of really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, watching the TV --
R:  [NOISE] Upset.
L:  -- and stuff and I'm like --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like, "What's going on?" and --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- I see everything.
R:  [NOISE] Did something happen? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And I see everything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I was just like, "Oh, my God".  I was just [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really taken aback and it was just -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I'd missed all of it and everything, [NOISE] but --
R:  Well, that's probably a blessing though because, you know, when, um -- I mean, to have [NOISE] -- I -- I didn't actually see the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the buildings being [NOISE] hit until w- -- I live -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work in mid town.  We did -- we didn't have a TV.  I had a radio.  I had a friend who was, you know, emailing me as he found out 'cause he works up in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Conne- Connecticut but, you know, in the [NOISE] financial field and they're -- they have the news streamers all along, [MN] um, the day.  So, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] I mean, I knew -- [MN]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I went downstairs, um, there's a restaurant, you know, a b- -- in our building and I guess we're like, "If ever I needed a drink it's [LAUGH] right now", so ...
L:  Right.
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they had, um, fighter jets buzzing right around and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] it was -- I'm -- it was so weird.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Had to be like out of a movie.  I would think it had to be so --
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  -- out there, just --
R:  And then when Bush came to town, um, I lived -- I live somewhere else now, but I lived on Thirty First and -- or excuse me, yeah, Thirty First and Second.  And --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on First Avenue is where the [MN] -- the, um, morgue is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's right there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, [SIGH] um, Bush was coming to, you know, the hospital and whatever and the morgue, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I looked out and on top of one of the buildings right by my house there was a sniper.  And [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my goodness. [LAUGH]
R:  You just think, "Oh my God".  And I -- the first thing I said is -- is, "If I see that guy, I bet there are ten others that I don't".
L:  Oh, yeah, they hide [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they hide good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Wow. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, it -- it just was almost surreal.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  You know?
L:  -- the word I was looking for, surreal.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I wondered how other people, you know, from out of town --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kind of felt about it.  I -- a lot of people that -- you know, my family and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- friends were -- and thank God for email at that point 'cause all of the phones were down, but our --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- DSL was working and I just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I called my sister initially.  I said, "Tell everybody I'm okay right now --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'll email, you know -- [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  "-- as -- if I can".  So ... [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But, you know, every message from every high school friend I got [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- was like, "Where are you?  I want to hear your voice".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  And [LAUGH] --  So ...
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It's sounds like you have a baby in the background, huh?
L:  Yes, nine months old.
R:  Oh. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Boy or a girl?
L:  A boy.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's such a fun age.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  What's his name?
L:  His name's Jacob.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, hm, [LIPSMACK] I know a Ja- -- a little boy of my, um, college room mates is Jacob.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's a cute name, so ...
L:  You got kids?
R:  No, uh-uh.
L:  No?
R:  Just a dog. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Who's sitting here right -- right now.  He's my best friend. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I love animals.
R:  Um, how long have you been doing these, um --
L:  Um, this is my second one.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, this is my third.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm try- trying to think.  I -- I've missed a couple where they've called and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um --
L:  I've missed so many. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Have ya? [LAUGH]  I just wonder how long [NOISE] it's going to go on, 'cause at first --
L:  I think they do three.  I think that's all you can do.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I just mean, um, how long the study itself'll --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- go on, because --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- I didn't hear from them for like a week and then all of a sudden [NOISE] I got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Me too.
R:  So people must -- I -- well --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I suppose it was Memorial Day or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that was playing --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- into it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] So ... [SIGH]  So, ah --
L:  I guess we could talk more about, ah [NOISE] -- supposed to be kind of like how it changed our lives like --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- like have you --
R:  Go ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I was gonna say, what do you -- it hasn't really changed mine much.  I don't really --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- fly.  I don't travel --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or anything.  Suppose it didn't really affect me I don't think as much as it would be living there.  So --
R:  Yeah, I, um -- actually I flew to Boston two weeks after --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and I thought, "If I don't get on a plane I'm, you know, now, I never will".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause I'm not -- I'm a jittery flier --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to begin with.  Um, but, ah, it really hasn't changed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much that I do, although I'm very careful --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- in the subways, um.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  You know if they see a -- a box that's just sitting there --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- they'll close the things down and [MN] --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a little bit more vigilant of, um, [NOISE] you know, if I hear a -- a plane that's the most -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] that's what really gets me, I think, because I -- you know, I heard it --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and you just wonder well is it -- you know, is that far enough up, or ...? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So, ah, but other than that I -- I don't think it's changed --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the way I live.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- either you're -- either you're gonna stay here or you're gonna --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- go, and I'm the type that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- says, you know, they're not -- they're not going to dictate to me what I do.
L:  Yeah, I think if -- if you spend all your time [NOISE] worrying about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- and what's going to happen and making yourself [NOISE] -- I mean, some people even get kind [NOISE] of paranoid about it -- it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kind of life is that, is kind of how I look at it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, and you guys, I mean, you've got the Sears Tower, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  -- which was on the list supposedly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I was getting emails saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "They're closing the Sears Tower" and --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Closing everything in --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- Los Angeles, and it -- yeah, it's just -- I -- I ge- -- don't wa- -- think that I act differently, but I -- I may, [NOISE] um --
L:  Right, [NOISE] yeah.
R:  I put up with more, like, [NOISE] um, [MN] in a airport, you know --
L:  Oh, goodness, yeah.
R:  -- I don't get too crabby about [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- getting --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you know, they --
L:  All the checks and stuff.
R:  -- do the wand or they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- check my bag.  I -- I just -- it doesn't bother -- bother me.  Before it kind of bugged me, but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, no, better safe than sorry, you know?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Um, [NOISE] but that's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- about it as far as I [NOISE] -- um, [LIPSMACK] how I changed and, ah ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] That I -- that I, um, did anything else.  Oh, my gosh, I've got cupcakes in the oven.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Better go save 'em, huh?
R:  Yeah, I think they might be done now.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] So ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I wonder how long it's been, 'cause usually they tell us in [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at ten, but ... [NOISE]
L:  I was thinking about ten minutes, but --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess not. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Not that I'm bored, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah, what do you do?
L:  Ah, I [NOISE] stay at home with my
