L:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Amy.
L:  Hi, Amy, I'm Erin.
R:  Nice to meet you, sort of.
L:  Pleased to meet you too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um --
L:  [SIGH] [COUGH] So, our topic --
R:  Well --
L:  -- is health and fitness, huh?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Yeah.  I get -- I go in spurts, like, sometimes I'm very -- exercise very regularly and then other times I'll just lapse for, like, months. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just depends --
L:  [SIGH] I think a lot f people are --
R:  -- on -- 
L:  -- like that.
R:  Yeah, it just depends on how busy other stuff is going and [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it's -- also, for me it's a lot harder to exercise in the wintertime --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, 'cause I usually -- what I usually do is run and I like to --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- run outside, so, [SIGH] yeah.  How about you?
L:  [SIGH] Um, you know, actually, I'm a dog walker --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I'm outside every day. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [SIGH] And walking every day, so, um, [SIGH] that's -- that's pretty much what I do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, how many miles, or do you just go by time, or ?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know how many miles.  I'm usually out, [SIGH] um -- w- I usually walk the dogs for, you know, twenty to thirty minutes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, you know, um --
R:  Probably a couple of miles.  Well, no, at least one --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- probably like, uh, one.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  At least one.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I sometimes, depending on, like -- you -- I live in -- I live in B.C. and, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I can usually walk from clients [MN] -- you know, from one house to another --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- from one client's house to another --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- so --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- uh, yeah, I'm pretty much on foot all day so it's kinda -- it's kinda nice actually. [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow, that's interesting.
L:  But, um -- yeah.
R:  I actually used to -- I actually just moved from B.C., I was there doing an internship.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, so, actually, when I was there I didn't exercise much 'cause you're always walking everywhere, or at least --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was.  Um, 'cause I didn't take my car there, [SIGH] um, so even though I wasn't exercising, I just felt like I was, like, in pretty decent shape. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah --
R:  Um --
L:  -- they say -- they say walking is actually really good exercise for you.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  Um --
R:  Uh --
L:  I mean certainly it doesn't -- there are a lot of things it doesn't do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Um, do you do anything with weights or anything like that?
L:  [SIGH] Um, you know what?  I don't.
R:  No, I don't --
L:  I --
R:  -- either. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I try, but, I don't know, if I'm pressed for time, I'd rather just run a little bit than do the weight, although I know you're supposed to and all that, but [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- No, it --
L:  -- I mean, like, they -- they say that it's something that -- that women should -- should start doing, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when they're younger because it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] um, supposed to ward off osteoporosis and things like that, but --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- [SIGH] but I'm lazy and I hate going to a gym. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I know what you mean, um, although, I don't know, there -- there have been times when I've been a member of a gym --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I like this -- the -- well, have you ever tried this elliptical machine thing?
L:  Mm mm, what's that?
R:  It's pretty neat, it's kind of like a cross between, uh, running and biking.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You're like -- yeah, you're, like, standing but you're -- you're f- you're kind of, like, pedaling with your feet, sort of.  It's kinda hard to describe, [LAUGH] but --
L:  Oh, oh --
R:  -- [SIGH] Um --
L:  -- I've seen those.
R:  Yeah, that's a really --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [MN] I love that machine.  I like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that.  Um --
L:  No, actually, that's probably a good workout.
R:  Yeah, and it's not too hard on your body, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as opposed to running, but, um, [LIPSMACK] also I would do, like, the rowing machine every now and then, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm just [SIGH] not as regular as I should be. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um --
L:  [SIGH] When I was, um -- [LIPSMACK] when I was a kid and really, um -- through high school I was a gymnast, [SIGH] so --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I was --
R:  That's really hard.
L:  -- you know, in really good shape and, um, I guess I got kind of lazy after a while. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I guess I thought, "I -- I've spent all those years in the gym, [MN] I don't need to do that". [LAUGH] I thought I couldn't -- you know -- 
R:  I used to do that a little bit in high school, but I was -- I was not very -- I mean, it's hard to do once you're older, you know, like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sort of thing -- 'cause I have friends that had taken it for years --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- like, since they were really young and [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I found that it was really hard to pick that up, like, in high school. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I had a newfound appreciation for gymnasts [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- after I took some courses and realized how difficult it was.
L:  Yeah, it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember my practices, we spent, like, it -- [MN] you know, they'd be four hour practices, and we'd spend, you know, two hours just doing conditioning and [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- running and strength exercises and stuff, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Man.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So were you on a gymnast's --
L:  It's [MN] --
R:  -- thing in high school?
L:  Um --
R:  Or you were doing it for fun?
L:  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't for my high school, it was for a -- a competitive team, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, but, yeah --
R:  That's neat.
L:  -- it was -- Hm?
R:  That's, uh -- that sounds cool. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was fun.  It took up a lot of time, though. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I'm sure.
L:  And eventually after, you know, I saw all my friends going out and [SIGH] going to dances and going to movies and stuff on Friday nights I was like, "Okay, enough. [SIGH] I don't need to be in the gym on Friday nights, [LAUGH] every night". [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] So is it --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- something that you were in -- you wanted to do, or your parents, um, got you into it, or ?
L:  Um, [MN] no, I wanted to do it, I mean, like, you know, when I was a little, little kid, my mother put me in the tumbling class 'cause she thought it would -- I might like it and [SIGH] I got hooked and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- yeah, and then I wanted to keep doing it.
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Neat.
L:  So, yeah. [SIGH] But, um --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- but, yeah, it does get [MN] -- you know, you were saying when we get older it gets harder to do things like that and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, I have a -- I have a lot of friends who -- I have a lot of friends who, um, weren't very athletic as --as kids but since then, you know, they've sort of, um -- like, I -- I had one f- I have, uh, my best friend and she was never athletic as a kid but as she got older, like, in college, um, she started running.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, now she loves running, she runs in, um, [LIPSMACK] -- you know, she does, like, little -- little local races and things like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that now, so, I mean, she came to it late but she really likes it and she's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- gotten fairly good at it.
R:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] 
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:   -- like, I was really into running and fitness and I think I just got burnt out on it, like [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I, uh -- I ran the half marathon and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm not a -- I'm not a real runner, so that was really hard for me.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  And after that I just was so sick of running, just for, like, a long period, I didn't really exercise much.  Um, I don't know, [LIPSMACK] I really go back and forth, but I need -- I know I need to get more consistent.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um --
L:  Do you ever have any, um -- any joint problems or anything from running?  Like, do your knees bother you or ankles or anything?
R:  No, no.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Well, 'cause I -- I mean, I just kind of jog [LAUGH] more.
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] So, it's pretty -- it's not very -- I don't push myself, like, really, really hard as far as --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- time or anything like that. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] like, one thing I did do recently that was kind of fun was, uh indoor rock climbing.  I don't know if you've ever done that, but --
L:  Oh, I've never done it but I have some friends who really love it.
R:  It's really fun and I think it's a good workout because my wh- whole body was sore the next day. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [SIGH] But, um, yeah, it's really a lot of fun.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and it's not as hard as you would think.  I mean, you do have to learn a few things like how to tie the ropes and then there's, uh, special knots and things you have to do but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] but as far as, um, just the climbing, it wasn't that difficult at all.  I mean, some are --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- obviously some of the -- some of the -- some of the walls are more challenging, but, [SIGH] um, I though it was really a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  And I'd -- yeah, I'd love to get into, uh, more of it.  Well, first of all, it's sort of costly, 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you either have to rent all the gear or buy all the gear [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and also you have to find, you know, a -- a -- like, a partner, like, a person to climb with you.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's true.
R:  And my friends are, like, either afraid of heights or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- out of shape or [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it's been challenging trying to find someone to do it with me, but --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] yeah, um --
L:  Is there a gym near you or do you have to -- like, do you have to go a distance to -- to get there?
R:  No, there's one near me, there's --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- one near me.  So, [LIPSMACK] yeah, actually there's one, um -- I went to the -- actually, this was in Virginia where I went, it was just, like, last month --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or so.  It was, um --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- it was, um, in Alexandria.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, it's called Sport Rock and I think there's like --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- there must be one in Maryland as well, but it's a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, that's cool. yeah, I had -- my, um -- actually, my ex boyfriend used to go rock climbing, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he did outdoor rock climbing too, though.  He was, like --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- really hard core. [SIGH] And, uh, he --
R:  [inaudible]  
L:  -- kept trying to get me to go, and I was [LAUGH] like, "Are you nuts?" [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, outdoor is a little different.  I don't know, that might be --
L:  I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that might be, uh, harder. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] But --
L:  I know, it's --
R:  -- yeah --
L:  -- difficult --
R:  -- you should try it, it's lot -- it's a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah, you should keep trying that, I'll have to give it a go.  And you [inaudible], "You're small, you can -- you can fit your -- your fingers and your toes in all those little crevices, it'll be a piece of cake for you".  And I'm like, "Yeah, if you don't look down". [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- that is -- that can freak you out sometimes, [LAUGH] but [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, the gym that I went to, none of the walls are super, super high, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and plus, too, you have all the safety harness and all that stuff, so --
