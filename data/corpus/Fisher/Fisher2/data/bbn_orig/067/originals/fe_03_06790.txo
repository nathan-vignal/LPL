R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hey, ah, I'm Kelly, I'm from Seattle.
L:  Oh, I'm Eve and I'm from LA.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And ignore the beeping, I think somebody's trying to call through but I didn't have, um -- I don't have, ah, call waiting anymore or whatever [LAUGH] one of those features.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'm just going to wait 'til they figure out that I'm not answering the phone.  But --
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, what --
L:  Well, I don't hear it.
R:  What -- oh, you don't?  Oh, okay.  Good.  'Cause no-one --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- it's loud and obnoxious on this end.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What changes have you made since September eleventh besides a little added paranoia to our lives?
L:  Um [LAUGH] right, let me see.  Um, I've, um -- yeah, maybe a -- a little bit more wariness but almost more a wariness of the government than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of our government than of terrorists which [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's definitely true.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Any, ah -- I mean it's definitely affected me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- economically a lot, because I'm in the arts and there's just -- nobody's hiring and nobody's buying paintings and [LAUGH] so my brother's having to close down his business --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he's a photographer.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So it -- it's not, you know -- it's like, well are saying ch- -- and meaning changes by choice [LAUGH] or changes by, you know, I'm going to the food bank. [LAUGH]  So --
L:  Right, I --
R:  -- it's like, what --
L:  -- guess it's either one, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Yeah.  I'm a graphic artist too.
R:  Oh, are you?  And hasn't it hit you guys hard?
L:  Yeah, I mean, we're definitely -- definitely been struggling.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  But, I mean, ah, actually I started struggling a little bit before September eleventh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's actually gotten worse now because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, unemployment right now and everything.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, so you had a -- yeah, because I never had unemployment.  But that -- that is, I mean, three qu- -- I haven't, ah, really am not even looking for work because there isn't any to be had.  I mean, I am, I glance through the paper and, you know, but it's -- I not pounding the pavement [LAUGH] 'cause much more qualified people than me, you know, half my friends are out of work too.
L:  Oh.
R:  That's what I wonder when they claim six percent, you know, whatever their national figure is, six percent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or seven percent unemployment.  Who are they kidding? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's more -- it seems like it's about thirty percent or if not more.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah. [NOISE]  Um, it does seem like that.  I don't believe anything I hear. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was going to the, ah --
L:  [LAUGH] I really don't.
R:  -- when I went to the protest marches or whatever, they're claiming it was, you know, a thousand people, and no, it's like twenty thousand.  And then conversely I happened to be in one of the -- to support our troops, you know.  I just was trying to get out of town and [NOISE] got stuck in the middle of it and there -- there -- that --
L:  You know what, I'm busy, can I come -- [NOISE]  Okay, thank you. [NOISE]  Five minutes. [LAUGH]
R:  -- went on the nightly news, they were talking about being thousands, and no it was maybe [LAUGH] you know, four hundred.  [LAUGH] Yes, so -- it's like a little be skewed here.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.  Definitely I -- I know exactly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what you're talking about.  I went to them too and -- yes.
R:  But the good news is a person I can't stand fled the country [NOISE] 'cause he was so afraid of the Bush administration. [LAUGH]  So [LAUGH] -- so Saddam did me one big favor.
L:  Oh, wait, say that again?  I'm sorry.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, just there's -- there's a guy in town that I absolutely [NOISE] detest.  And he got so freaked out by -- by the right wing crack down and the Patriot Act and everything that he's m- moved to Canada 'cause he thinks that he'll be --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, thrown into jail and disappear and -- you know?  He -- he's a little nobody, nobody would give a shit about him.  Oops.  I wonder if we're supposed to swear.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Give a -- give a darn about him.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um --
L:  Well, I think they -- I don't know, maybe they just want all the linguistics --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- you can put in here, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  That's definitely the third most commonly used word in the English language I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah -- but so that's the good news that there's a -- has a little bit of a backlash, but we got --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- rid of a -- [LAUGH] I got rid of a known pain in the neck in Seattle.  So the war has been good to me in that respect. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, what were you saying -- what was that last thing you said?
R:  Oh just [NOISE] -- just saying that there is a -- a silver cloud to this [NOISE] -- to the war and all the right wing --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The --
R:  -- propaganda they got rid of -- they got rid of Larry for me.
L:  You know where I'm in -- at right now?
R:  Where?
L:  Do you listen to -- do you know Pacific Radio?
R:  Yeah, a little bit. [NOISE]
L:  That's where -- I'm like, um, at KPSK right now --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, are you?
L:  -- and not Los Angeles.  Yeah.  Like, 'cause I -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- well I used to work here and it's, um -- and they're having --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a fun drive right now.
R:  I'm come --
L:  Because you sound like -- you sound like you're kind a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- activist or something.
R:  A little bit but, you know, I'm -- I'm, ah, a activist of convenience [LAUGH] kind of thing.  Lately --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've just been deleting all the emails 'cause it's just too depressing.  And, you know, I --
L:  Like, not a real active activist. [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  Yeah, I'm a -- well, I am in the arts.  I am in all these other areas.  I have email lists of, like, six hundred people that I forward out information to every day, but -- on the antiwar stuff I've gotten.  I mean, I still forward on a few, but I've stopped going to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- protests and the things.  It just got discouraging.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, no, um, well, I'm coming down there for a show called Extremoganza [NOISE] in LA.
L:  [MN]
R:  There's three shows of a friend of mine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's a painter, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's at the Key Club oc- -- on June --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fifth, sixth and seventh I think.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So keep your eye out --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- for it to come.

R:  The -- Greg Escalante --
L:  [NOISE] I gave it --
R:  -- of Ju- Juxtapoz magazine is behind it all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he's Extremo the Clown.  He's an art car guy.  So it should be some pretty wild shows. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It's at Copro Nason Gallery one night, the Key Club one night, and I think UC Irvine.
L:  Um, what is the name of the show again?  Extreme what?
R:  Extremoganza, 'cause his name is Extremo the Clown.  He's a good clown, evil clown. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, I know it's going to be -- [NOISE] he's gonna have like clown karaoke at the Key Club [NOISE] on Thursday night [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, the Key Club.  That's a big, big club.
R:  Yeah.  And then Friday night is, ah, an opening at Copro Nason and then the most elaborate one sounds it -- like it's at UC Irvine and he's doing these things with black light paints and, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, three D paint.  This wild new --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- three D paint that --

L:  [NOISE]
R:  Art cars.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.  Cool.
R:  So I'm --
L:  You know, my sister lives in Seattle.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  She probably knows my car.
L:  She's an artist too but she's, like, a sculptor.
R:  [NOISE] What -- what's her name?
L:  [NOISE] Sarah Arageti[?].
R:  Hm.
L:  She used to work -- she make's the -- do you know Two Balls?  Have you ever heard of that place?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Um, and she used to be, like, a waitress.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think she was a manager there or something.  But I don't think she works there -- she hasn't worked there a long time.  She works at a different restaurant now and I'm not really sure -- I don't recall the name of it. [NOISE]
R:  D.N. -- I mean I certainly know a lot of 'em.  I don't go out to eat that much but I go to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Two Balls there.  They always have great art in there.
L:  They have great what?
R:  Art.  They have --
L:  Oh, art.  Yeah, yeah.
R:  A lot of stuff hanging on the walls --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that -- um, I think -- you know, I think the owner's a photographer or something 'cause I think I've seen the owner's art up there.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] But -- yeah, I know most of the people in the art scene.  Maybe I'd know her by face [NOISE] if not by -- if not by name. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, ask her if she knows me.
L:  Okay, what's your name?
R:  Kelly Lyles [NOISE] L.Y.L.E.S.
L:  L.Y.L.E.S.
R:  And I'm mostly a painter but I drive the leopard car.  She might know the car.
L:  Kelly Lyles.  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um, so Kelly where were you on -- on [LIPSMACK] September eleventh?  Ah --
R:  I was --
L:  -- what were you doing?
R:  [NOISE] -- watching, ah -- my girlfriend woke me up screaming, "We're being invaded [LAUGH] we're being invaded".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah, scared the shit out of me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Scared the --
L:  Oh, my God. [LAUGH]
R:  -- the stuff out of me.  Um, and then -- ah, then I called -- I tried to get hold of my stepmother who lives right in Manhattan [MN] and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- get through to her.  But eventually did get through to her husband which surprises [NOISE] me still since phones were tied up for days.  [MN] But I did get through to her husband and he then -- she called in and then after that the phones were down the whole day.  She -- she was in one of the office buildings --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they were locked in there for the -- for the day or something.  They couldn't get out of there.  Maybe it was just 'cause of everybody's asthma and the smoke and everything.  But, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I don't think she was any danger but she was [NOISE] like two blocks from there and was not allowed to leave.  She didn't get home until, you know, whatever five or six that night. [MN]  Um, so and he's a -- he was an invalid and he was pretty freaked out by the whole thing but he couldn't, you know, talk to her, get to her. [MN]  And he was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- worried about her all day.  And he actually died soon after that so I'm -- I wouldn't be surprised if that kind of pushed him over the edge. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And he's -- [NOISE] he's Jewish so I think probably all the, um, you know, the implications of the -- the Palestinian thing really freaked him out.  But -- but it was sad.
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] I was hoping she'd move.  I mean I love Manhattan, I love New York, but, you know, she -- she moved there with him and [NOISE] it just seemed --
