R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Oh, hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [SIGH] [MN] I'm --
L:  I'm --
R:  Cindy. [SIGH] 
L:  Hi, Cindy, I'm Sara.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Are y- are you on a cell phone too? [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, no, I'm on a [COUGH] [NOISE] cordless with a headset.
L:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] I'm driving home with my kids.
R:  Oh. [SIGH] 
L:  Anyway.
R:  W- [SIGH] where do you live at?
L:  I'm in Miami.
R:  Mm, [SIGH] I'm in Greeley, Colorado.
L:  Colorado, wow.  How nice.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It's nice and hot. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  It's hot already?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  It's very hot here.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Anyway, I guess we should get onto the subject.
R:  Yes. [COUGH] 
L:  Changes.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [SIGH] I -- I -- I -- personally, I haven't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --made too many changes in my life, I -- I don't know about you.
R:  I haven't either. [SIGH] I just -- you know, I figure I [MN] trust in the lord and whatever's going to happen's going to happen, we can't stop it. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Right. 
R:  But --
L:  [SIGH] So, the, um --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- [MN] my -- my husband travels a lot, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it was a little scary right after --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, when -- when [MN] he was going to get on a plane --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but, uh -- but he was okay about it.  He has the same philosophy as you, if it's my time, it's my time and --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  -- and that's it.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  What happened --
L:  But it -- you know, it was a little scary right after it, but --
R:  Oh, yeah, [SIGH] but what helped me through it is, see, I had my brother that's, um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] -- he's -- in the -- in the -- well, he's retired military, but he works, you know, helping re- [NOISE] helping the military through, you know, with their problems and stuff [SIGH] and so he was supposed to have been [NOISE] in the Pentagon that day when it -- where -- [LAUGH] exactly where the plane went in. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  [SIGH] So, that kind of scared me, [NOISE] but I -- [MN] I talked to him and he says, you know, he says, there's more [SIGH] precautions going on to protect us from everything than you'll ever know about, so he says, "I wouldn't even worry about it" and [SIGH] since he's in the military, you know, [NOISE] that's the way I felt about it. [SIGH] That he says there's more things going on that -- to protect us than we know about. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] I'm -- I'm sure there are.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I'm sure there are.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause he says they're not going to tell us everything they're doing and everything that's going on. [SIGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Right, [SIGH] now the [MN] -- I -- I f- did I -- I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my parents --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- my parents flew in maybe --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a few weeks after it happened, um, from -- from England and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it didn't stop them from -- from flying in, um, although, you know, a lot of people had canceled holidays.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- uh, but they -- you know, they went ahead and came, they'd --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- booked their holiday, paid for it and said, [SIGH] "We're coming anyway". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  When -- while they were here we went to -- to a lot of -- you know, we went to a lot of places and -- and -- and it was dead, there was --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, nobody around anywhere.
R:  Mm. [NOISE] 
L:  So, a lot of people did cancel their holiday --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they [MN] decided not to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- get out.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  But, um [SIGH] -- but it didn't really -- you know, even though it affected us emotionally --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it was a very hard --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] time [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH] It was.
L:  -- [MN] personally, in our lives, it --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- really didn't change --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that much, aside from the fact that we have to get to the airport a little bit earlier.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  And, uh, f- for the security reasons.
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE] 
L:  I guess that was one of the major things, I think --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was mostly security, just changed a little --
R:  I know it.
L:  -- bit.  A little bit, but not -- but not --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- not too much.
R:  [SIGH] No. [SIGH] And, see, my parents had booked a [SIGH] -- they're older and they've retired and they had booked a yacht tr- [NOISE] or a [SIGH] [NOISE] cruise, [SIGH] and they said, my father said, "Well, whatever happens, happens".  He says, "I've got this [MN] cruise booked and paid for".  He says, "I'm not go" uh, he says, "I'm going on the cruise". 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] He said, "Whatever happens, happens". [SIGH] 
L:  Right.  Yeah, and you can't [MN] -- well, it was -- it's like -- it's like they kept saying --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- after it happened, you can't let them --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- affect too much --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the way that you live because that means they -- they --
R:  They've won. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] Y- exactly.  They try --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they accomplished what they set out to do which is to make [MN] --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- make us afraid to live [SIGH] and to do the things, you know, that we live for.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Uh, [MN] so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I -- I think that they were right, the government was right trying to, you know, tell us to continue to living our life as normal --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and -- and we did really, pretty much.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] So did we.
L:  I remember my -- my -- my kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at that time they were in a -- a Jewish, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- preschool and, um -- but they put in extra security, they had --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a -- they started, [SIGH] you know, not allowing --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- anybody into the school without, um, [LIPSMACK] identification and [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you -- you know, they really took precautions there.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But, um, other than -- you know, other than that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] not too much changed for us.
R:  [SIGH] It didn't for us either, and I've got -- well, my son's twenty two but [SIGH] [NOISE] he's -- he get -- he says, "I don't even want to see it on TV, I've seen it the first day" and he says, "I don't want to watch it, I don't want to hear any more about it" [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, he j- he just got to the point where he didn't want to hear anything more about it. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You know, but we did -- we did get pretty bombarded with it all.
R:  Oh, I know it, [NOISE] [SIGH] and I think there for -- it seemed like for about a week that was all you could watch on TV [LAUGH] unless you had cable or something which we didn't. [SIGH] 
L:  Wow, no i- it -- but it -- but it was, uh, [MN] it was mesmerizing though.  I mean, I spent -- when it happened, the -- the first --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- two days, probably --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] just glued --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to the TV.
R:  Oh, my husband and I did too.
L:  [NOISE] You just couldn't --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- tear yourself away from it.
R:  Uh-uh. [NOISE] 
L:  But, uh --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I th- I think life has pretty much got on as normal for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- for most people.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  Probab- I mean, the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- obviously the ones it affected the most are the ones that had family involved and lost --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and lost, uh, people --
R:  [NOISE]  
L:  -- i- in it.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] [SIGH] And see --
L:  And fortunately --
R:  -- I'm looking --
L:  -- I wasn't one of those.  I don't know anybody that was --
R:  I don't either.
L:  -- lost.
R:  [SIGH] But, see, I'm looking for a job and have been since before that and [SIGH] [NOISE] [COUGH] they say that because of nine eleven, that, you know, it's hard to find jobs and with the war then it was harder and [SIGH] I'm older, so they say that has a lot to do with it too, so 
L:  Oh, th- yeah, the economy is terrible right now.
R:  Oh, I know it. [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  It's terrible.
R:  [SIGH] I'm just thankful --
L:  It's terrible, my --
R:  -- my husband has a -- [MN] I'm [MN] thankful my husband has a job 'cause I can't find anything.
L:  Now, he's -- my husband is also looking for something new.  I mean, [MN] fortunately he still has a job right now but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- looking for something else, but [SIGH] it's -- it's a very difficult time to find any kind of work.  I know so many people that are looking or out of work --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- uh, trying to find something and it's --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] very, very hard.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  We had a friend that was out of work probably for, like, eight months.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, yeah, the economy is really, really bad.  The only good thing out of it is that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- we d- we were able to lower our interest rate. [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Well, that's good. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So, y- but -- but it's -- apparently that's --
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- gone back up again, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, if that's going back up then the economy must be on the rise.
R:  It must be. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, which is good news for everybody.
R:  That's right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] It's just going to take a while.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I know it. [NOISE] [SIGH] And the war --
L:  So --
R:  -- I think made things harder too, so, um [COUGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  The war?  Oh, for sure.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  All that money they spent on that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's incredible.
R:  [SIGH] And we're still over there fighting, basically.
L:  Yes. [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And I've got --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- three cousins in -- cousins over there yet.
L:  [SIGH] Really?  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Wow.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And one of them --
L:  i [MN] I don't have --
R:  -- is in special forces, so you don't know what he's doing or exactly where he is. [SIGH] So that's a big worry for me. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that's too bad.  Um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- yeah, the war didn't help too much. [SIGH] 
R:  No. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, hopefully, uh, things --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- will turn around soon.
R:  [NOISE] I hope so. [SIGH] 
L:  [MN] 'Cause this recession really stinks. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Anyway, so it's hot in Colorado? [SIGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  [SIGH] It's been about eighty today and yesterday. [SIGH] 
L:  Wow.  We've had a lot of rain here in Miami.
R:  [NOISE] Mm. [NOISE] [SIGH] And see, we're in drought too, we've got a -- [COUGH] had w- water drought out here so we w- we wish we had some rain. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, no, we've had lots of rain.
R:  Mm. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] And now's the season where we start having our --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- forest fires and it's going to probably be worse this year because of the drought. [SIGH] So, we need some rain bad. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Have you done any of these calls before?
R:  I've done one before and it was on crafts.
L:  On what?
R:  Cr- um, arts and crafts.
L:  Crafts, okay.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I -- I -- I've done one other one --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that was smoking.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  So, this is my second.
R:  [SIGH] So, it's my second too, so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] We can do the second one together. [LAUGH] 
L:  Gosh, and I -- I didn't look --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- at what time we started --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- out.  I don't know what else there is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to say --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- on September eleventh, so 
R:  I don't either. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  I -- I w- I would --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- think that most of the --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- country would say that it didn't affect their lives --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- too much.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  Which is -- which is sad to say, really, I mean, it is --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- a very big thing that happened, and, uh --
R:  It is. [SIGH] [NOISE] 
L:  -- affected -- probably affected people in -- in -- more in a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- an emotional way.
