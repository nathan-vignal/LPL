R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Pam.
L:  Pam, my name is Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary.
L:  Exactly -- do you know anything about this study?
R:  Uh, just it's a linguistics study but they don't say exactly what, just what it's about because it would influence us.  Uh, just that they want different people from different parts of the country.  It could even be, uh, something totally different, like, uh, content or so forth.  So, um, exercise [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- do you exercise on a regular basis?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Oh, most people don't, um --
L:  I do plenty of walking.
R:  That's good, that's aerobic --
L:  I do lots of walking.
R:  I used to love to walk but my knees finally gave out.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  I am too.  I liked walking, it's very good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When I was working that was what kept me sane at some of the jobs that I had.
L:  Mm.  So, what part of the country do you live?
R:  California.
L:  Oh boy.
R:  And you?
L:  That is pretty far.
R:  Where are you?
L:  Pennsylvania.
R:  Ooh, yeah, right in --
L:  How's your weather?
R:  Hot.  Very hot.
L:  Oh boy.
R:  I live in a mobile home in Yucaipa which is, uh, about an hour east of LA so it's -- [SIGH] it gets very hot out here [LAUGH].
L:  My goodness, no it's -- it's quite rainy.  Rainy and cool.
R:  Ooh, ooh, well that would sound wonderful but if it gets hot then you've got mugginess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then, uh, I wouldn't -- I have -- I don't have to run out and water every day when it rains.
L:  Oh okay. [LAUGH] No, we've had plenty of rain and thunderstorms.
R:  Mm, oh my.
L:  Mhm.  So, I don't know we don't exercise.  I do walking, you don't.
R:  Mm, I -- I do, uh, exercises almost every morning, at least five out of seven days because, uh, I have Fibromyalgia and all the stretching and what strengthening exercises I do really make a difference.  Uh, especially because, uh, I have -- I've talked to other Fibromyalgia patients so I know -- know I'm not crazy but everybody's shoulders and neck or their bones seem to go out, dislocate a lot and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I can't stand going to a chiropractor 'cause it just falls right back and it hurts.
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  Well, have -- have you ever been to a chiropractor?
L:  Yes, I have.
R:  Man, some people they put 'em back in they're happy but me, it -- it just goes right back so -- and to pay to be mugged marvellous!
L:  Um, I used to go and [SIGH] some of the cracking that they would do would give some relief but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of 'em I really didn't like because I left and it felt like I was in more pain -- [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than I did before I came. [MN] But, um, I don't go anymore.
R:  I used to know a good one but, uh, he's out in Glendale and I'm not so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, you mean it's a distance for you?
R:  Uh, yes.  Yes, Glendale is not that far from LA but I'm about an hour or so away -- about an hour away from LA on the freeway.
L:  I have a girlfriend who lives in California but we've been out of touch for so many years she used to live in Van Nuys.
R:  Oh, yeah, San Fernando Valley.  I used to live out there myself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I did much more exercising [LAUGH] out there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I hate exercising I -- but I used to belly dance, um, I can't anymore I just keep up the stretching and I used teach but I had to stop, not because I couldn't do the movements but because I couldn't carry my stuff over to [LAUGH] -- over to the cub- clubhouse to teach it [LAUGH].
L:  Oh my goodness, you used to teach belly dancing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh that's interesting.
R:  Yeah, I can't really dance anymore not -- not for -- more for a minute or so but, uh, I -- and I miss it and -- but I miss the walking more.
L:  So, how long are we supposed to talk?  Ten minutes?
R:  Ten minutes and they'll let us know.  I think we're halfway through.  Uh, actually --
L:  And so is -- is -- what is this, um, I know a friend gave me some information for doing questionnaires, I'm wondering if this is the same thing.
R:  Uh, I -- you never know what they're using it for.  I have, and I have no way of knowing if this is right or not, but, uh, a hunch that what they do is they're -- they may be looking more for what we're -- uh, you know, we have a -- a topic but what people actually talk about.  I saw, uh, a show on I -- it was a Discovery or one of the Discovery channels or even the History chan- uh, no, Science channel on how the brain worked and it sees that they have a theory now that wo- language was developed for gossip.  Not just to exchange information --
L:  I did hear them say something about linguistics, is that correct?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  Not -- not just for information, exchanging information, like, to make a tool, but who's doing what with whom.
L:  Oh, come on!  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't believe that.
R:  Oh yeah, language developed because if you -- if you listen to people's conversations people get back to -- get back to gossip.  Well, we think of -- as gossip is worthless but -- or we're not supposed to but if you watch TV, man, there's all st- they're always talking about movie stars and biography there's a big -- and I notice that everybody, uh, seems to get back to that.
L:  Well, when I -- when I hear the word gossip I ususally think of it in a negative connotation.
R:  Yeah, talking maliciously.
L:  Not -- not something that's positive such as something you watch on TV and news or -- or other kind of talk programs that I think are a little bit more meaningful.  When I think about the word gossip I think of something negative, you know, it's -- it's really fruitless.  So, I hope they don't consider this gossip.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, exercising.  Well, I like stretching, that's -- that's my favorite form right now but I -- I do some strengthening 'cause I'm -- I'm forty seven and about five years ago just when I was thinking, you know, "Does this do any good, you know, giving up some cookies at night and doing some exercises when I get up --"
L:  So, you were born nineteen fifty six?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.
R:  Then, you know, does that really -- and -- and then I went to, uh, uh, a place where I met -- I went to a social even where I met friends that I hadn't seen in a long time.  This one woman that I knew was younger than me, she was like a grandmother and, wow, I just -- I said, "Well, yeah, maybe it does [LAUGH] work".
L:  Mm.
R:  It must work.
L:  I would like to begin exercising more but, uh, [SIGH] I -- I just don't have the discipline to ge- I would have to do it before work, which I don't have that discipline.  My exercise is to get to work.
R:  Oh yeah, the -- if I do it -- see if I wait, if I don't do exercising like strengthening in the morning, I won't do it.  I'll wake up by then and then I will go on [LAUGH] without doing it.  But I --
L:  And then to do it after work, usually I'm too exhausted.
R:  Oh no, you just wanna unwind.  It --
L:  Just kinda wanna unwind and relax and [SIGH] think over the day et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
R:  Oh, maybe yoga --
L:  So, then that leaves the weekend and then the weekend you're so filled up with doing [MN] all that you couldn't get done during --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the week so I guess my's would be -- my lack of exercising probably would be parallel with poor time management --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or just poor discipline. [LAUGH]
R:  Making some time for yourself, maybe yoga at night, you know, in the evening.  That's a good way to unwind and relax and it's better to do --
L:  If I could sit in that position long enough [LAUGH].
R:  Oh -- oh, yeah, that -- that put me -- but see that -- that's more extreme.  You need to -- to find some -- like Rae Vonda[?] -- Rae -- Rae Won- oh I can't -- I don't know her name, [NOISE] I -- I tried to -- I turned her on once and I tried to -- she was too extreme, I mean, yoga -- my -- I don't go that way either so nice gentle yoga program.  Yo- you just find the ones that work for you and you ignore the ones that don't. [LAUGH]
L:  And I didn't really like the water consumption that went along with yoga.
R:  Water --
L:  I -- I did yo- yoga many years ago and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they really almost insisted that you drink at least eight -- although I drink a lot more water now.  But, uh, insisted that you had to drink eight glasses of water --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- per day.
R:  Most people don't drink enough water [MN] --
L:  Oh, I -- I've --
R:  -- I try to carry --
L:  -- I've got to the point I drink water daily, you know, so --
R:  -- I try to carry like a small bottle of water around with me 'cause if I have that with me, you know, I'll keep drinking from it.
L:  Right.  But I just -- I just enjoy drinking water.  So, I guess I got that part [MN] -- excuse me.
R:  Well, yeah, and you walk and that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- good -- that's very good.
L:  Um --
R:  It keeps the --
L:  -- oh no I do walk every day.
R:  Good.
L:  I mean, just because I don't -- I don't drive --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so --
R:  Oh, me neither.
