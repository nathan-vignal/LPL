R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Barbara.
L:  I'm Janet.
R:  I do exercise regularly, do you?
L:  Uh, I try to if the weather's nice enough and cooperates [LAUGH].  Sometimes that's not always, uh, possible.
R:  Well, I -- 
L:  What --
R:  -- I've solved that, I use an exercise bike inside.
L:  Oh, okay, well that -- that sort of makes the climate, uh, nice all the time, doesn't it?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  I said, "That makes the climate inside your house nice all the time".  You don't have to worry about rain or snow or wind or being too hot, do you?
R:  Oh, I'm seventy five years old and I don't like to get out in bad weather.
L:  Oh, I can't say I blame you.  I -- I don't have a exercise bike or a treadmill or anything so my -- mostly my form of exercise would be t- to walk.
R:  D- do you walk very far?
L:  Uh, well I walk on my break at work and it's probably -- it's about a mile total, you know, it's like a half a mile up the road and half a mile w- on the way back.
R:  Walk alone?
L:  Uh, no, I have two other ladies I work with and they -- we -- I make them go with me [LAUGH].
R:  That makes it easier, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah, when you have someone to go with you it -- it does make it easier.  Uh, once in a while I'll walk by myself but most of the time, you know, I try to find somebody to go with me.
R:  Do you have safe place to walk?
L:  Yeah, well where I work at is, um, I have to walk by the National Guard Armory.
R:  [LAUGH] That's safe.
L:  And I think that's pretty safe. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you are lucky [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah, I am lucky.  I mean, you get to the point, you know, some of those guards that are standing outside there, you know, they -- they get to know your face and you get to know theirs so, you know, you feel like they're probably looking after you [LAUGH].
R:  Well, nobody is likely to do -- try to commit any kind of a crime, I would say, in an area like that.
L:  Uh, we- well, I hope not.  I guess that, uh, I don't really fear that much for my safety and the- and there's other people who are walking too who, uh, work in the other buildings so it's, you know, you usually see somebody that, you know, is sort of a regular walker, you know, most of the time.
R:  But you don't feel like you're alone?
L:  No, no, I don't feel like I'm alone.  I -- I wouldn't feel comfortable going into, you know, places where, you know, I wasn't familiar with or, you know, didn't know the area that well.  So, like I said, I'm -- I'm not worried about that.
R:  I have a safe place to walk.  I live near a hospital --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the people who work at the hospital are constantly walking by my house --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I would have a nice place to walk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I know that I would really cheat because I just will not make myself get out in bad weather.
L:  Well, I -- like I said, you know, do you live, uh -- we- what, uh, part of the country do you live in?
R:  I live in West Virginia, I'm -- I -- people, when they hear that Virginia part, connect it with the south but really we have fairly cold weather --
L:  Oh, mhm.
R:  -- we've had it -- terrible weather.
L:  Yeah, I -- I've -- you know, I know where you're at and, like I said, it's not a big state but it's a mountainous area too so you do catch a lot of that -- you know, from Ohio and the front --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and things like that.  Especially in the winter you all get quite a bit of snow.
R:  Yes, and I live right on the river too.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] And that means cold wind.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, well you have a -- you have a lovely area there.  You're not very far from me really.
L:  No, no, we're not that far.  I li- in fact I live in a little town, uh, right outside of Rawleigh so we're only, you know, a couple of hours from the beach and about three or four m- hours from the mountains so I guess that's why they -- they call the [inaudible] vacation land [LAUGH].
R:  I think part of West Virginia has moved to North Carolina, a large part, to find work too.
L:  Yeah, I -- we -- we have had a big influx of people in the last, um, you know, ten to fifteen years.  It's a -- it's a booming area.
R:  [NOISE] You're lucky to fin- to live where jobs are easy, it makes it easier for your children --
L:  I hope so.
R:  -- to find work near home.
L:  Yeah, well I -- my children are still, you know, young.  I have one that's, uh, eight and another one that's fourteen so they're not ready right yet to enter the work force.
R:  But it -- it passes fast.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You'll be surprised how fast.
L:  Oh, yes, I know.  I know my oldest one, you know, he -- he's already trying to grow up too soon.
R:  [NOISE] They would be a lot of fun to exercise with too.
L:  Oh yeah, well in fact we were out in the backyard, you know, playing a little touch football, you know, before it got dark this evening so, like I said, they -- they like to get out and, you know, shoot basketball and, um, play soccer and go to football so they -- any time they can get you outside they sure will.
R:  Well, that gives you an incentive to get outside too because you want to be with them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and spend some time with them.
L:  Oh yes, mhm.  Although sometimes it's -- you know, it's hard to fit exercise in, you know, every day but, you know, it's something that, you know, you just feel like you sorta have to do to maintain your health.
R:  Well, they say it is really just about the most important thing you can do for your health.
L:  Mhm.  I know my -- my brother in law was talking, uh, a few weeks ago that, you know, he felt like he could probably, you know, eat about anything he wanted to as long you exercise vigorously enough to, you know, be able to burn the calories and fat and, you know, keep your heart rate up and, you know, I have to -- I'm mean, of course we all wanna try to eat right but, you know, sometimes you can sneak in that extra piece of pie or something and feel like you can reward yourself if you can get the exercise in.
R:  I think if you don't exercise it's almost impossible to control your weight.
L:  Mhm.  Well, they say the older you get the -- you know, the harder it is but, like I said --
R:  They're right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They're right, huh?
R:  Very right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've fought my weight my whole life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I've pretty much managed to control it but it hasn't been easy.
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, you know, it's a battle a lot of us have to, uh, you know, battle from the time I guess we, uh, get out of adolescence until -- until I guess we decide we just can't -- not gonna worry about it anymore [LAUGH].
R:  I was fine until I started -- had my own home and started cooking for myself and buying groceries.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I bought what I wanted, cook what I wanted and I ate it. [LAUGH] I -- I -- when I was a -- young and somebody else was doing the meal preparation, I had no struggle with my weight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Boy, when I started it myself.
L:  Didn't like -- so then you get to do what you wanted to do. [LAUGH]
R:  I tried recently to lift some hand weights.  I'm trying to build my arm muscles back up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, and I hate those weights.
L:  Oh, do you?  
R:  Yes [LAUGH].
L:  Are they the -- the dumbbells or ...?
R:  Yeah, just plain hand dumbbells.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I found I was having trouble holding my hands over my head to do something like change light bulbs, hang curtains, and that's what got me started --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it does help but, oh, I don't like the weights.
L:  No, no, well, like I say, I'm sure anything's hard to do when you're exercising -- when you first start doing it but, I guess, you know, each day it gets maybe a little bit easier.  Have you been doing the weights very long?
R:  Uh, I've only been doing them about two months.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I di- I started out I could hardly do two or three repetitions with two pound weights --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I build up now that I'm doing fifty repetitions with three pound weights.
L:  Now, see that -- that much better.  Like I said, you know, you -- you gotten a little stronger in the last couple of months.  I think you're doing very well.
R:  See but I'm trying to build myself up to five pound weights.  From what I've read I should be able to do five pounds but ...  I have the weights, I don't know whether I'll ever get to them though.
L:  Well, you know, you -- you've come a long way in two months, I think you'll make your goal.  Now, do you usually exercise in the morning or in the evening or ...?
R:  If I don't do it when I get --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out of bed I put it off and don't do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm lazy.
L:  Oh yeah, well, I think, you know, most people are gonna choose the path of least resistance and, like I said, it -- I guess, like I said, we do our walking at break time at work and it just sort of becomes a habit, you know, so as long as the weather's, you know, pretty good, you know, it's not raining or, you know, snowing or -- well, we don't get a whole lot of snow but, you know, it's not bad weather I'll -- I'll go find my friends and I'll say, "Let's go" and of course a lot of times they'll, "Oh, let's not go today".  I say, "Oh yeah, we need to go" [LAUGH].  I think --
R:  Well, another advantage of doing it at noon is you don't eat during that time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but you gonna find time to feed -- feed your stom- -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I find myself eating out of boredom, uh, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have to watch that all the time.
L:  Yeah, it'd be nice if, you know, we all loved celery then we wouldn't have to worry about it so much, would we? [LAUGH]
R:  No. [LAUGH] Well, you're young, you don't have -- you don't put the weight on like you do as you get older.
L:  Oh, I -- I ...
