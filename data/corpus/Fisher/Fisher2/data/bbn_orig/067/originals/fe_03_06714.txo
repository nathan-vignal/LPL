R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Debbie.
R:  [NOISE] My name is Rhonda.
L:  Hi, Rhonda.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess the question was -- do you exercise regularly?
R:  No, I don't, um, [NOISE] I -- I would like to but I don't, do you?
L:  Um, well, I'm a member of a gym and I'll do really good for a couple of weeks --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I'll go a couple of weeks where I don't even bother to go.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  How come it makes you not wanna go?  Or do you just get too busy or ...?
L:  Um, well, I've been -- I'm kind of a bookworm personality. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I've -- there's never been -- I've never been interested in sports, the only reason I'm trying to exercise is I wanna lose weight.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  But I hate it. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, I'll make myself do it.  I'll get all psyched up and make myself go but I can't maintain it for very long.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].  Well, see, I like walking and I would really like [NOISE] to get walking but it seems like after the day of work it seems like that's all -- I -- I can't even get myself up to go walk just because of being too tired from --
L:  I understand that.
R:  -- working and everything so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Next month -- the gym that I go to has a beautiful --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- outdoor pool --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and next month they're starting, um, water aerobics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, in the evening after work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so my goal is to go to that [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- starting in June.
R:  Well, that sounds like a nice goal. [NOISE] I -- I keep on telling myself and my -- I have some kids [NOISE] and I keep on telling them that I would like to go walking and I can't really seem to get into the -- the health club scene maybe 'cause I'm not overweight but I'm kinda middle [NOISE], you know, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I just don't wanna go 'cause of course [NOISE] you -- you feel, you know, feel fat and everything and so it's like [SIGH], "No, I don't think so".
L:  Well, you know --
R:  So --
L:  And I am overweight and so that makes going to the gym that much harder --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because there's all these skinny little girls and --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh so pretty and [NOISE] proper looking and all that kind of stuff and --
L:  Luckily my husband and I are members of this gym and it's not really one of those meat markets, it's mostly older --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- married people.
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  So, at least in that regard I feel a little better.
R:  Yeah, if I had to do it I would probably try to look for one of those or for women only type, you know, where it doesn't matter kinda 'cause everybody's got -- you don't have to look all pretty and everything to go work out, basically make up and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I think that's what probably I would do to try to [NOISE] -- if I decided to go to a gym I would try to go to one of those, um, let me see [NOISE] --
L:  I like walking.  It's just same like you, by the time I get home from work I'm tired. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I had a friend who was gonna go walking with me [NOISE] and we did really well last year and, uh, it was kinda like our -- our thing, you know, to go walking and everything but then, um, I moved and so -- I moved away and I just haven't got back into the -- the routine again so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and it seems like I -- I walk better if I have somebody to walk with, you know, like a grown up or whatever and I just haven't found that somebody who would [NOISE], you know, sounds good to go walking with so --
L:  I unders- --
R:  My husband's really into -- into sports and everything but he, um, he doesn't exercise he just goes and does his sports and then he re- regrets it later so [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] My husband will work out at the gym and he likes going to the gym so he'll lift the weights and, um, do the tr- the bikes and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he enjoys it so it's easy for him to get motivated to go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, he has tendonitis in his ankles so he won't go walking with me --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- cause then his feet hurt.  So --
R:  So, him being motivated to go, does it make you wanna go more or -- like to go with him?
L:  Well, for a while we were going together, um, and he would like show me how to the weights and, you know, stay at each machine with me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- but then he didn't get a very good workout because it took so long.
R:  Oh, to do -- to work with you and everything so okay.
L:  Yes, and so he started going by himself and that's --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- probably another reason why I'm less motivated now I have to go by myself.
R:  Okay, I understand I was gonna say --
L:  It's kinda boring.
R:  -- you know, it would kinda be like a together thing if -- if you could do it together but I would see, I guess, both of your points, you know, um, I wouldn't wanna do it by myself, um, I -- maybe just 'cause I'm not a by myself person but, um, but I would want somebody to be there with me but it would -- I guess it would be hard.
L:  Because he's -- like, he used to lift weights in high school and -- and he knows what he's doing.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And so I slow him down.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  So, he's trying to becoming a trainer instead of somebody who wants doing the workout so --
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm glad he likes it but, like I said, sports have never been my thing.  Nothing.  I've never played an organized sport, I've never really -- I don't know.  It's hard when you're middle aged to all of a sudden --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get into it.
R:  Yeah.  I never -- well, I never was into it in high school and things like that either and I don't really get into watching it.  My husband gets into watching it and playing it and usually into softball, playing softball but watching all sports, that's the only thing on TV is sports so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's the good and the bad, I guess, with it. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess if I had children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I don't but I want them to be involved --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in some sort of sport when they were young --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so when they grew up they weren't like me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Totally foreign to the concept. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I, um -- I -- I have some kids and I pro- I promoted trying to get them involved and not being couch potatoes and things like that and -- and, uh -- 'cause I want them to -- to not wanna just sit around and things, like you say, when you old -- when they get older and things so -- and they have.  It's kinda hard 'cause they have to try and find their glit- or their niche on what they like and what they can't do or, you know, what's not their thing so ...  My -- my girls have really gotten into running and so, uh, they've -- I wouldn't have thought in a million years they would have but -- 'cause I never did but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- [NOISE]
L:  I remember in, like, grade school I liked the hurdles --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, the track meets but I don't think I could do that now [LAUGH].
R:  I don't think I could either.   My daughter did hurdles and she -- she said, "I'm not doing that anymore" so -- she actually did the long distance type running so ...  But, yeah --
L:  Good for her.
R:  -- no, I'm not really very big on health and fitness.  I don't even do well health wise, even eating, you know, nu- nutritiously and everything.  So, I'm very not rounded off per- person.
L:  We, um -- because I'm overweight I'll try different diets and I know that's terrible but I have a hard time sticking to anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially, again, because my husband won't stick to it with me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's just the two of us so it's kinda hard to cook for one person.
R:  Yeah, I -- it's hard, uh, well even, um, with us, I wanna be on a diet but then money gets tight or whatever and it's expensive, it doesn't really seem like it would be expensive to buy health --
L:  It is, it's way --
R:  -- type food --
L:  -- more expensive.
R:  -- but it is, it's -- it's a -- we -- it's easier to budget if everybody's on the same milk, you know, 'cause you always have -- like you said, you always have to, you know, fix for that one person and things so everybody else you still have to make them another meal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's kinda like you're buying two -- you know, for two meals and everything and --
L:  Well, and healthy food is just more expensive.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can get, um, you know, just flour and sugar and those sorts of products, you know, for nothing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if you wanna start doing low fat and actually reading the labels and eating low fat, they're all more expensive.
R:  Mhm.  And I'm sure they -- that's their gimmick, you know, I -- I think all -- all places have gimmicks and I think they know that, you know.  And I -- they get so frustrating and I can see how people that don't have a lot of money get overweight [NOISE] because it's hard, you know, money wise --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and [NOISE] even to be in the fitness clubs and everything is -- is expensive and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I -- I could really see somebody just sitting and being a home and [NOISE] being overweight.  You know, you just -- 'cause me and this friend at work was talking about it and I would love to be on a diet but sometimes [NOISE] you just can't put it in the budget to do [NOISE] and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you just kinda messed up, I think. [NOISE] I wish they wouldn't do that [NOISE] I wish they would think about it, even my -- even like the diet pills and stuff are expensive and it's, like, you can't do anything, you know.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, I could [NOISE] see people and I -- I do wonder how in the world can they be that -- and they're really big, you know, really huge and it's [NOISE] easy.  It's easy to sit and eat 'cause they make it that way, I think, 'cause they know --
L:  Well, I'm not --
R:  -- you're gonna go back to the store. [NOISE]
L:  I wouldn't say that I'm in the really [LAUGH] huge category and I work full time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I don't -- the problem with me, I think, is I don't enough.
R:  Mhm [NOISE].
L:  'Cause I don't eat breakfast usually before work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I work all day and I'm usually too busy to stop or snack or anything and I'll have, you know, a sandwich or something for lunch at my desk and then I won't eat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- until dinner.
R:  Right.
L:  And so they actually say that your body gets trained to where it stores fat if you don't eat enough.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  To -- to help itself whatever.
L:  Yeah, that your -- your metabolism slows down.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I kinda think that's where I'm stuck --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my husband eats way more than I do and I don't lose anything.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.  I feel like I have to eat -- my sugar level gets messed up if I don't eat a lot, not a lot but just --
L:  Frequently?
R:  Frequently.  And so I have to eat frequently an- and I'm on a con- I'm -- I'm on the move -- I'm kinda opposite I'm on the move all day, I work in a factory and I'm a group leader so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's kinda like I'm walking all day and I feel like I should really skinny [LAUGH] [NOISE] because of all the walking but it's a different kind of walking.  You know, it's not steady, constantly it's just on the go all the time.  But I keep telling myself --
L:  I've had a desk job for eleven years.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I've got that desk job spread [LAUGH].
R:  Well, an- and I do too.  I -- and I think mine is a lot of born to it, you know, I -- all my family ...
