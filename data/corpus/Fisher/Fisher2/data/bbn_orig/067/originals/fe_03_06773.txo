L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Hi.  My name is Sadie.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Sadie.
L:  Um, my name's --
R:  [NOISE] And --
L:  -- Diana.
R:  Diana, [NOISE] okay.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about how our lives have changed since nine eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know that mine really has a whole lot.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah [LAUGH] --
L:  Are y- -- are you on the west coast?
R:  No, I'm -- i- ironically I'm in, ah, Pennsylvania.  I'm a New York native.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I actually have a lot of relatives that were on Wall Street and, you know, but none of them happened to be in the city that day but, you know, so I -- I should be affected but I'm really not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  W- w- where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm from Los Angeles.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So since I'm on the west coast I don't think we were as -- we were affected, but not -- probably not to the extent of people on the east coast.  Um --
R:  Um, um, I mean probably the only thing that, ah, I noticed last -- a -- a -- a year ago my son took me to a sporting event for my -- for mothers day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it -- it was up in the Meadowlands of New Jersey and of course like handbags, everything had to be searched and I mean but, like, literally that's the only thing that -- that I've found --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different in my life.  I mean, since nine eleven I haven't travelled by plane.  I had done so, you know, quite a bit before that.
L:  Um --
R:  I know that's changed and my -- my son has said when he's travelled by plane, you know, he's like constantly -- he's constantly the one being picked out.  Not that he's -- he, you know, would fit any sort of profile.  He's like six five, blonde [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whatever, but, you know -- but -- but seriously I mean -- you know, like I said I've [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think I've been to Manhattan since then, although I have passed, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- by Manhattan and -- and seen how empty the skyline looks and stuff like that, but, you know [LAUGH] I -- I just really haven't seen a change in -- in -- in my life [LAUGH] you know?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I think, ah, you're right about the security in the airports.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, 'cause I travelled after September eleven.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I travelled through Europe and even --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I think, um, all airports in Europe were very, very, like, careful about, um, selecting who they wanted to screen some more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, recently when I travelled on a plane they -- like at LAX there's a [inaudible] about -- like they want to see what type of shoe you're wearing and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everyone has to take off their shoes before they go through the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and then I've been interviewing for jobs and so a -- a lot of the companies that I've been going to, um -- like I have to bring photo ID and then they do all this security check to make sure, you know, you're actually invited into the building before you're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're allowed to enter.  So probably that.  I don't know there hasn't been too much change, but --
R:  Yeah, I mean I live -- I live in Lancaster, PA, and it's -- you know, [SIGH] it's really -- even though it's a city, it's a small town.  And it's -- you know, so [SIGH] I -- I -- I mean, I'm trying to think when it was.  We w- -- I guess we went to a -- a local court house to a sheriff cell, and I -- I guess we had to go through a metal detector there.  But at the same time, like three years ago I was on jury duty -- federal jury duty in Philadelphia and I had to go through a metal detector, so I don't know when they put the metal detectors up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it could have been after nine eleven, it could have been before.  I just assume that they were always there simply because of my experience in Philadelphia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, that could have been a reaction to nine eleven, I -- I just don't know.  Um, I guess a few days after nine eleven I was in a local mall and I guess some prankster called in a bomb threat and the mall --
L:  Really?
R:  -- was evacuated.  But, you know, [LAUGH] that was -- you know, that -- that was like a -- a one time thing.  But I can't really recall anything that I've done other than, like I said, Meadowlands, New Jersey, being searched before going into, you know, a -- a pu- -- a public place like that.  Ah --
L:  Do you feel less secure in your life?
R:  Um, I don't really.  I -- I just guess [SIGH] -- I guess for the most part [SIGH] that [SIGH] -- I have other worries [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It's like -- yeah, like health worries and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, financial worries and stuff like that.  But not, you know, [SIGH] I -- I mean like I [SIGH] --
L:  I guess 'cause -- 
R:  -- I guess it's like --
L:  -- is Lancaster a pretty small city or ...?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think our whole county doesn't even have half a million people and it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- probably more like three hundred thousand.  And I -- you know, I walk the dogs a- alone at night.  I've never felt, like, tinky[?] about, you know, being out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A- and I'd -- ah, [inaudible]  I don't go into the quote bad unquote section --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of Lancaster which everybody knows where they are.  But other than that, I mean I've never felt y- -- awkward about, you know, going places at night a- a- -- you know, as a female or anything like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So maybe that's why it -- it doesn't bother me.  I mean, even to the point where I -- I work for a high tech electronics slash defence contractor. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, we have, you know, people of all ethnicities, ah, because we're, you know, we -- we have high tech engineering and, you know, Lancaster isn't the center of the universe for a lot of high tech engineers.  They'd want to be in --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- California or New York or Boston or whatever, but not in Lancaster Pennsylvania.  So a lot of times we do have foreign nationals and, you know, people of Middle Eastern descent.  People of oriental descent.  And again it's just, you know, after nine eleven I -- I certainly didn't look at any of them any differently, you know?  I just -- I didn't feel, oh, you know, there's some sort of sleeper that's here to, you know, steal our technology or [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whatever.  It just -- you know, it -- it never o- occurred to me.  But then I'm probably just a very trusting person, so [LAUGH] --
L:  I think --
R:  -- maybe it should have occurred to me, I don't know.
L:  -- since I'm in a -- I think since I'm in a big city I kind of feel like less secure.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just because, you know, there's been a -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, I think there's been a heightened security warning and --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- um, all that going on --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- that I see on the news.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  And, um, being in Los Angeles I feel like if they're going to target --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- another big city again, like, um, if not New York, then maybe San Francisco or Los Angeles.  And I'm actually -- my family's actually in San Francisco.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  So that actually kind of worries me a little bit.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] I guess, y- yeah, that --that thinking about it, a- as I've been rambling on here, possibly one of the reasons I don't feel that threatened, is we lived here when -- you know, back in I guess seventy nine when Three Mile Island happened.  And that was of course a lot mo- more like immediate event. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] What- whatever and -- and, you know, that -- that affected me although we n- -- we didn't evacuate or anything.  We stayed here.  So maybe I -- you know, it's just like, well, anything can happen to you anywhere.  M- maybe that's just, like, my sort of attitude that I've taken away from it because, you know, Three Mile Is- -- Three Mile Island is still there.  A lot of the radioactive waste is still in there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, so a -- a lot of the security, ah, e- events or involvement around here has been centered around Three Mile Island and we also have another one, Peach Bottom, which is maybe ten or fifteen miles from TMI.  So, you know, m- maybe that has colored, you know, my -- my feelings that I just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know.  It's like, well, you know, we -- we went through this catastrophe, you know, twenty some odd years ago, so it -- you know?
L:  It's n- -- it's no big deal?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, of -- of course it is a big deal, but at the -- the same time with TMI --
L:  It's like you shouldn't --
R:  [NOISE] -- really.
L:  -- change -- you shouldn't change what you're going to do.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean --
L:  Um, and you shouldn't change your daily lifestyle just because this happened.  Because you can't live your life in fear.
R:  [NOISE] Right, and -- and -- and we certainly haven't.  Um, not that we did anything, you know, big or wondrous or whatever before and we've -- you know, we had pretty much due to health reasons stopped a lot of travelling and stopped a lot of, you know, doing a lot of whatever. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But at the same time, you know, a -- you know, shortly after nine eleven we went up to New York to visit relatives and everyone was saying, "Oh, aren't you nervous to go there?  Aren't you nervous to go there?"  And it's like, no.  You know, it's just -- it just never -- you know, I -- I just never really thought that much of it.  At that time our son lived in northern New Jersey, and again the only thing that I was a little bit concerned about was that he did travel a bit and until we were able to, you know, talk to him on nine eleven, I mean, for all I knew he could have been on one of the airplanes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Because, you know, he just -- you know, he would have not reason to, you know, like call us up and -- and say, "Oh, I'm going to Florida tomorrow" or whatever.  We just -- you know, we'd go for two or three days not -- you know, maybe we try and call him and there'd be no answer, or even, you know, call him at -- at the office and there'd be no answer, and he'd say, "Oh, well I was down in Tennessee" or, "I was down in Florida" whatever was his plans.  So just, you know, that was my only concern until we were able to talk to him and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, not that I would have expected that he would have been in Manhattan be- --
