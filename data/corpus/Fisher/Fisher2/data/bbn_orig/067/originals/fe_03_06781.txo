L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH] My name's Trish.  I'm in Los Angeles.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How you doing?
L:  Good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Ah, my name's Lori --
L:  Right.
R:  -- here in Indianapolis.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Indianapolis.
L:  Wow, cool.  [NOISE] So has your life changed since --
R:  Mm --
L:  -- September eleventh?
R:  -- not really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just more security to have to deal with.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [inaudible].
L:  At work or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Every time anybody does something wrong it's -- or can't do something it's because of the September eleventh.
L:  Wow.  What --
R:  So it's more of a pain than anything, but ...
L:  Where do you work?
R:  I work at Eli Lily.
L:  At where?
R:  Eli Lily.
L:  What is it?
R:  It's a drug company.
L:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I guess they'd have to watch all of that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Mm. [NOISE]  Has my life changed since then?  To be honest with you, I lost a good friend in September eleventh, so it kind of changed after that.  Like I was sad, you know?  I went to her funeral and kind of got depressed.  But then about a year later ... are you there?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, a year later I started, um, traveling more because the rates really fell down.
R:  Oh, yeah, they have.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  I just wish I could get the time to travel. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my job is pretty good.  I get about a month a year, so ...
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  I can make the time, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I get like two weeks.  But, ah, if I was going to travel I'd have to take my kid with me and [MN] --
L:  Oh, you have a kid?
R:  -- then work around his school schedule and all that, so it's ... [MN]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's easier just to --
L:  Do you have a cold?
R:  -- stay home.  Yeah, allergies.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] man.
R:  They're terrible.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  It's the time of year.
L:  What is it, like ten o'clock in Indianapolis now?
R:  Yeah, it's about ... well, it's about nine thirty.
L:  Mm, mm.
R:  I just got off the phone with my friends and -- and then they ph- -- called in.
L:  That's funny.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How did you sign up for this?
R:  Through the computer.
L:  Oh, cool.  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Cool. [LAUGH]  Have you done it a lot?
R:  I'm on it all the time.  Huh?
L:  Have you done a lot?
R:  I think I did, like, one -- one about, like, a week ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ... have you got paid from them yet?
L:  No, not yet.  Not yet.  And I did one last week too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And that was about it.  It probably -- 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- takes time.
R:  That's what I was thinking.
L:  Yeah, it probably takes 'em some time.  Well, yeah.  So, I mean, to stay on topic or anything like [NOISE] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- my life hasn't changed too much except for I have gotten the opportunity -- like, I went to -- I've been to England four times.
R:  Ooh, that would be neat.
L:  And, ah -- well, I've been three times, I'm getting ready to go back in July and then we're -- I made some friends there so we're going to try to go to Greece 'cause it's really cheap once you get to England to go to Greece.  Mm.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Except for the hotels are expensive, aren't they?
L:  [MN] No, actually.  I mean, they have expensive hotels, but they have some really, really cheap ones too, so ...  Like, on the beach and -- they're not bad.  Sometimes --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- you can even stay -- ah, some friends of mine stayed in a -- in an old -- what was it, like where nuns used to live?  Yeah?  And it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- basic, like there's a bed and -- and showers and that's about it, but [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, yeah.  So [inaudible] dollars a night.  I mean, you can -- you can find things cheap so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And then just -- you -- you're there at night and then you go out and see everything during the day.  So in a way, I mean, I'm thankful for that.  Sometimes I'm like -- I'm not thankful the planes had to crash, you know, or there was --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- attack, you know what I mean?  But --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I am trying to like do stuff since I can afford it more now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And especially since -- I think the President's supposed to be giving us more money too, aren't they?
L:  For ...?
R:  Aren't they supposed to be giving us another tax rebate thing or something?
L:  Oh, I'm not sure if we're getting another rebate.  I think there's a cut.  I remember last year we did get a rebate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, yeah.
R:  No, they were talking about doing another rebate this year.
L:  Well, bring it on.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] They --
R:  I think they said like four hundred for children or something, I can't remember what the exact was.
L:  Mm.
R:  But they were just talking about it.  They'd had --
L:  When?
R:  -- I don't know if he's signed it yet or not.
L:  Wow.  I did hear about some cuts but no other rebate.  That'd be kind of cool though.  I remember last year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- getting that check.  Yeah, that check kind of helped me on my trip too.  I remember [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's funny.  It's like all these people -- I mean, no but life hasn't changed.  In my building where I work -- I work in a high rise in LA.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, yeah, a few times we've had, like -- and it's close to the Federal building in LA.  So a few times we've had a few warnings or we've had to evacuate the building 'cause they had some prankster bomb threat or something, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So a couple of times I guess it's affected us that way, but -- mm.
R:  We haven't got anything at my work.  It's --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- not even a prankster bomb.  It was just they [MN] -- they're big on doing what you should be doing anyway, you know, so --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what do you do?  Do you, like, mix the stuff up, or ...?
R:  No, I just work at the data center --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- with their computers and stuff.
L:  Like where the orders are coming in or ...?
R:  No, just with their computers, like in operations.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We don't even touch the drugs.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't even know really what the manufacturing place looks like.  I mean, I've never been there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you're more like a business kind of side, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just keep --
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  -- track of the servers and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- make sure they do their back ups and all that stuff.
L:  Right.  That's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Pretty good technical stuff.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we play help desk sometimes and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- actually we play help desk a lot, but --
L:  [LAUGH] You help people with their computers, yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Usually silly people who call up that don't know anything. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And they're usually freaking out.
R:  Yeah, so they've thrown --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the mouse against the wall or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They freak out.  They do.  They do that at my job too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They call me 'cause I -- I kind of know what to do and they freak out.  And I'm like, "Don't freak out, we're fixing it" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  "So we're going to fix it, it's going to be working again.  Don't -- please don't freak out". [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]  They start breaking stuff and making things worse  than what it --
L:  Worse.
R:  -- already was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] It happens.  Do you work like regular shift?
R:  Ah --
L:  Like --
R:  -- I work day shifts but I have to work week- -- like four weekends on and four weekends off.
L:  Oh, I get it.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool when you have your weekends off though.
R:  Yeah.  I can go in for a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- night shift if I want to for overtime, but --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- I don't have to.
L:  That's cool too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you need the money. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly or on my days --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- off.  I can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [inaudible] for overtime.  But --
L:  That's not bad.  That's not bad at all.  Is it hot out there right now?
R:  No, it's beautif- -- except for just got the rainy.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But, weather wise today wasn't bad at all.
L:  Wow.
R:  It was like seventy five --
L:  Oh, it's perfect.
R:  -- eighty maybe at the most.  But it was raining.  It was gross, but --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, it's perfect then.
R:  At least once this rain gets out of here then it won't be too bad.
L:  Yeah.  And Indiana hasn't had it too bad, like terrorism. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think it's 'cause we're not on the coast itself.
L:  Yeah, it could be.  You kinda, you know --
R:  'Cause if they're going to come in from another country --
L:  -- people in Indiana are pretty cool.  [several inaudible words] nobody's after them. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, if they --
L:  And it --
R:  -- have to come in from another country, then it's going to be harder to get inside the land than it is --
L:  That's --
R:  -- to get somebody right on the coast.
L:  -- that's true.  I guess out here in LA sometimes it's a little bit -- there's -- there's a few things -- few -- few things pop up.  They go on alert and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They really think they're going to attack Disneyland or something [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Well, yeah.  Well, we go on alert and everything --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but I mean as far as really in reality I don't think it's that big of a deal.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause there's some high rises here, but what they consider to be a high rise here, isn't --
L:  Ain't it?
R:  -- nothing to your --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  So [MN] --
L:  Right.  Do -- do you see that when it happened on TV?
R:  What?
L:  I mean, did you see it that day?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like --
R:  I was at work when it happened.
L:  Yeah?
R:  'Cause it was like, um, seven o'clock in the morning or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seven or seven thirty here. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I was already at work and our boss called in and we thought he was joking.
L:  Right.
R:  And we were like -- 'cause he's a big prankster anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then we're like -- he's like, "No, no, it's not joking.  Well, I'm not joking". [MN]  So we had to hurry up and go to the computers and get on CNN dot com and found out he wasn't --
L:  Wow.  
R:  It was --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- weird.  
L:  Yeah, so you didn't really see it on TV that morning?
R:  Well, we have a TV off in another room.  So we all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- crowded around it too.
L:  Wow. [MN]
R:  We saw the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- second one hit.  
L:  Yeah.  That was pretty weird.  Then you knew --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something was up, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Like the first one, it was kind of like, "Was that an accident or something?" and when the second one it was like, "Oh, no, something's going on".
R:  Yeah.
L:  This isn't right.  The plane's on like manual going through buildings today, or [LAUGH] like what?  I remember watching that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was pretty -- it was weird.  Yeah, I had a friend that was on the -- on the first plane.  He was visiting his sister in Boston.  She's getting married and then he was on his way home back here, and, ah --
