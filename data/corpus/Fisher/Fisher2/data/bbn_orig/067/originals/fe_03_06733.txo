L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Aaron.
L:  Hi, I'm Andrea. [MN] How are you?
R:  I'm all right. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you exercise?
R:  Y- yeah, um, I ride my bike just about every day to and from work and I go to college so I ride there.  Um, so I guess that's exercise and I play --
L:  Oh, good man.
R:  What?
L:  I said, "Good man".  I gue- -- I guess working to and from classes counts?
R:  Sure.
L:  But, [LAUGH] um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- otherwise, no.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, like since school -- school is out, so at -- at the present time I have done very little even of that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I was going to the gym regularly and then I stopped.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I had work to do.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And it was gym or work, so   Work went out and well, yeah, school work went out, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I haven't been to the gym in a while.
R:  I've -- I've played basketball and soccer every now and then but not on any like a regular enough basis --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Yeah.  At some[?] --
R:  So, I guess mostly just riding m- --
L:  Huh?
R:  I'm s- -- I -- I guess just mostly riding my bike just about every day.  Like --
L:  I would like a bike.
R:  Mm.
L:  Bike would be good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause there's a lot of walking to do on my campus.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A bike would be nice.  I don't know.  I guess not.  'Cause the -- I -- I always get worried the bike is gonna get stolen and then I'd get really, really upset.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just gotta lock it up right, I guess.
L:  Yeah.  If I could just -- well, I don't know.  Well, I've seen people with bicycles like -- box -- like bikes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- locked up that just pieces just disappear.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um --
R:  Um, at lea- --
L:  It's just -- huh?
R:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  At least where I live they usually when they're like that that's 'cause they've just been sitting there for, you know, months and months and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they never got touched so people just start stripping them after a while.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, I mean, I've -- I'm in Gainesville, Florida.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, it's not like -- if you leave something sitting overnight it usually doesn't just get stripped.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Ok- -- and you park your bike on the side of the street --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  You come back in a hour and there are pieces missing off your bike. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
L:  It seems like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it be chained up too.
R:  I --
L:  They have them in places you [inaudible] chain 'em to.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Yeah, I lived in --
L:  But you come back in like an hour and it's gone.
R:  [LAUGH] I- --
L:  Back wheels, fro- -- I mean, like they strip the thingy.
R:  It's a different story up there altogether.  I lived up there for a while so I know what you're talking about.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is a different story up here.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I ca- -- I'm -- I'm from Atlanta so I can't wait to get home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To -- back to the south.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause people are a little nicer he- -- down there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, up here, yeah. [LIPSMACK] It's a different situation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they're kinda -- not -- not t- -- not too particularly nice.  But I think I'm gonna start going to the gym again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My plan is to actually start prioritizing health and fitness.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  So, at some point in time I will.  So, I plan to start going to the gym and start, um, eating right.  Yeah, that's the thing.
R:  [COUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Trying not to eat's the thing 'cause th- -- I eat what I like.
R:  Right.
L:  But that's not the best thing, so I can work on trying to   'Cause I -- like I guess when I got up here, like when I started school I thought it was really odd because like, excuse me, where I'm from we eat a lot of meat.
R:  Right.
L:  But up here they really don't eat a lot of meat.  Like I know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so many people that don't have -- that are -- that are vegetarians or don't eat very much meat.
R:  Really?
L:  But like they would always have like these breakfasts and stuff with no meat and I'm like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "You can't have a meal without meat".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "What's wrong with you?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like [LAUGH] --
R:  See I'm -- I'm vegetarian too.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I'm sorry.  I'm like, "No, if there's --"
R:  No, that's -- 
L:  -- no meat --
R:  That's --
L:  "-- this is not meal".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, [MN] no.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, no.  Like I just don't get it.
R:  Yeah, it's how I --
L:  Like can you pl- -- huh?
R:  That's how I grew up is eating meat all the time.  But then -- now I'm just so used to being vegetarian it's like I feel like I eat what I want but it's -- it's all vegetarian.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I just kinda eat what I want.  But I like really healthy food.  I mean, I like beans and rice and collard greens and --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- broccoli.  I like all that stuff.  You know, like [NOISE] pretty much all southern food.  I mean, I know most of it is meat based but I've -- I've like figured out ways to make it without it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ochre and all -- I love all that stuff.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it can be made without it --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  But, I mean, like I guess the thing is -- is that like I don't have to have like that kind of stuff made with meat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I just really like the actual meat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I am big on meat, seasoned meat.  Like ham is my favorite meat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like that's what I want.  I --
R:  M- --
L:  -- like hotdogs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And like these are -- and like I eat and I'm like   I need to have meat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm like, this is, you know, the greens was good, the corn bread, but I need some meat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- I'm gonna need s- -- I'm gonna need to add some meat to this -- to this food.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like I can -- I can -- I can eat a meal without meat every once in a while.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just as long as it's not a regular thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, so, up there do you like just go to an- -- you go to a gym or something 'cause --
L:  Well, huh?
R:  It seems like it'd -- it'd probably be harder to   If you're used to living down here you know where there's like -- I know in Atlanta there's, you know, p- -- seems like there's more parks and places like that in Atlanta than in Philly.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, that -- that's probably a hard thing to get used to.
L:  Well, actually though like Philly has a lot of parks actually.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like they have -- there's a park near where I live now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they have -- they have Fairmont Park which is a park system.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it stretches from like one end of the city to the other.
R:  That's true.
L:  Like there's a lot of p- -- but like, yeah, gran- -- there's not really like -- it's a little bit different in that it's a bi- -- it's a lot more crowded and a lot more closer -- closer together so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You do a lot more walking in general.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like the city blocks are [LIPSMACK] I think a little bit smaller than what I would call a block is if I had any concept before I got here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] But, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um -- but, yeah, like you do a -- you just do a lot more walking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because there's a lot less like parking -- like the cost to park a car is ridiculously high.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Nobody has anything called driveways.  They all park --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the street. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You have to pay to park on the street in front of your house.
R:  [LAUGH] I --
L:  And, um --
R:  I had --
L:  Don't even get me started on that.  I think --
R:  I had friends in South Philly and down there they just park like right on the middle of the intersection at -- in night.  It's crazy.
L:  Oh, like Broadstreet?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like on Broadstreet they park right down the middle --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of the street.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that little place where your -- where, you know, in between the two lanes? 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  They park there.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And in some places in South Philly, they double park.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm looking at them like, "Have they lost their minds?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like --
R:  Down -- down here you get like -- you'll get stopped if you just -- if you don't come to a complete stop at a stop sign but up there I guess the cops just have better things than 
L:  I guess so.
R:  They're d- --
L:  I mean, like I don't know.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I just don't understand it.  Like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  These people -- and like so the parking -- so most people just don't have cars.  You ever take SEPTA?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, they do have a really, really good transit system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I give 'em that.  Like the w- -- like MARTA, that they have in Atlanta is nowhere near as good as this.  
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, this is good.  They have a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really good transit system --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that goes to almost everywhere in Philadelphia and then some.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like I'm -- like most of the places outside.  Most of suburban Philadelphia you can get there on SEPTA.
R:  Mhm.  I mean, I --
L:  So, that's good.
R:  I even took the train all the way up to New York City when I was staying there.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Like, I mean, like and the thing is everything like -- I forget that because -- especially where Philly is.  It's right there in that little -- right there at the corner of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  All those places are so close together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You be driving ten minutes, you at Delaware.  You be like, "What?  Huh?"
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] Philadelphia. [several inaudible words].  Everything's real close together.
R:  Down here you'd drive that long and you're still like -- you might -- you might be one county over but --
L:  Right, that's what I'm saying like you drive three hours in Georgia, you're still in Georgia.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Drive a little further and you might still -- you'll still be there.  Five hour- -- oh, you've crossed the Tennessee border now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But like, yeah.  And the, um -- but we have a -- we have a, um, our school just finished renovating and build- -- renovating 'cause we had one al- -- a -- a new gym.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] Fitness Center and they, um, now they charge us.
R:  Oh, really?  Even though you're a student there?
L:  Ye- well, they charge -- well, yeah, that's part of the student fee.
R:  Oh, o- okay, okay.
L:  They charge us two hundred a dollars a year to -- to be -- to be a member -- to get a gym membership.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  Which of course doesn't include any classes or anything but you can use the facilities.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] If you like.  But then like I wanted -- then my sister came to visit me and I was like, "Oh, well I'll take her with me". 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It cost twenty dollars.
R:  Just for one visit?
L:  To bring one person for --
R:  Gee.
L:  -- one day.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I don't go more than once a day --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so what the heck am I do with the twenty dollars?
R:  Right.
L:  Pay for one time?
R:  Right.
L:  And then because she was -- she's seventeen so because she's under eighteen the only thing she can do is go in the pool and on the basketball courts.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And she's not supposed to be anywhere where I'm not so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- basically I get to sit and watch her swim or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- watch her play basketball.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She can't go into the weight -- the exercise -- the weight like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  The -- the fitness rooms or -- or -- or where the -- or where the aerobics machines are.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I can't go in there because she can't.  And I'm like, "What --"
R:  Hm.
L:  "-- the hell of the point?"
R:  So, it's just harder to have access to stuff up there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah, like they're -- like I don't know like   I'm like I've -- I remember -- I didn't think it was odd until somebody said something to me about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like he- -- like our camp- -- like because we're in Philadelphia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- campus security is hard core.  Like you can't get into the buildings unless you have a pink card.
R:  Mm.
L:  Like this is just real hard core like that.  Like --
R:  Right.
L:  Everything is just very much, um, locked[?] down.  They're checking who you are, what you doing up in the place.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And like I don't --
R:  Yeah, I remem- -- yeah, I -- that's true.  I remember that now.  I -- 'cause I -- I went -- I had -- I bike messengered --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I had to go into a few buildings in there and like you know, who -- you know, I had to show 'em my ID and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah.  That was it.  They're pretty hard core 'cause you know they're, um -- they're, uh, uh, I can't turn this it's not working.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes it is.  Because
