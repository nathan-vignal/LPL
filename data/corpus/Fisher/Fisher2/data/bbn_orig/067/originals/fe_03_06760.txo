L:  [NOISE] 
R:  My name is Michelle.
L:  Hi, my name is Bobbie.
R:  Hi, Bobbie.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm all right.  Have you done this before?
L:  [SIGH] I've done it one time, um, I'm still kind of confused about it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  As to what it is they're really trying to accomplish, right?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, because we talked on the subject, and then we just start talking.
R:  Well --
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  -- I guess there is something to be said for just communicating, I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and everything. [SIGH] They said the topic is September eleventh and if --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- whether you've made any changes in your life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, have you?
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Um, no, actually I haven't, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- and I don't know why, [SIGH] um --
R:  Do you think it's 'cause you just want to -- things to be the way they were?
L:  [SIGH] [MN] I want things [SIGH] -- I can't explain it, um --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I just --
R:  Well, maybe -- I mean, if you want me to I'll talk a little bit if you want me to.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH] Um, I -- I -- I mean, I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you this, I live in New York --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, in a way it affected me rather --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a little bit maybe more directly than [SIGH] other parts of the country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And I'd remember that for a long time a- initially after all of that happened, um, it was very hard for me to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- even get on the subway again and [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ride --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- anywhere near that part of the world.
L:  Oh.
R:  [SIGH] It took me a long to set -- you know, [MN] actually [MN] say it's okay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, for myself and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that, [SIGH] and it -- the -- I think over these last, well, I guess it's a year and a half now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it struck me the other day that [SIGH] there are just times, there are moments, you can be some place and suddenly all of it, the -- the real [SIGH] horror of it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it will hit you again.
L:  Right.
R:  And you don't have to have been, like, down that way or close to it or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything, it's just [SIGH] [MN] the -- the idea that it actually really did happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, it's sort of one of those things where in history [SIGH] when you hear about something really awful happening in history --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- there's so much distance that it doesn't have anything to do with you so you -- you can --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sort of [SIGH] feel the empathy of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- for it and everything, but it doesn't affect you directly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and this was one of those things that it's direct, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, it's, like, in its own way it's like [MN] there but for the grace of god --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and so I feel like [LIPSMACK] that's it made me have to think differently and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I get angry about that.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  The fact that, you know, before I was just like everybody else, [SIGH] living my life, doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what I do, or w- needed to do, in a given day [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now I have to look at things and people differently.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't want to, and --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- I get mad about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't like the idea of -- of, um, [SIGH] well, you know, guys standing in the subway with rifles.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, I mean, [MN] I don't [MN] -- I've been -- w- I've lived here most of my life and I never had to think of that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, [SIGH] and people say, "Well, you know, police walk around with guns all the".  I say, "It's not the same".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's not the same, so I -- I think [SIGH] I'm changed in that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I look at people, I don't -- I don't find myself being suspicious of people, but you do indeed do that [SIGH] second look --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you don't want to feel like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] but you do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  so, there's that aspect.  I was never a big person to fly on planes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to begin with.  I mean, I didn't -- I don't travel that way --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] that often, just 'cause that's not the way my life operates --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I was never even -- when I did have to be on a plane I was not a big f- great flyer.  I was fine once we're up and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- once we're down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm fine. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] But I [MN] -- the idea of maybe having to get on a plane is still kind of frightening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to me and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] and so there's part of me that wants to just sort of get on and still do what I do and try to find some [SIGH] quote unquote normalcy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] But some --every so o- every -- not every so often, but, you know, just when you think, "All right, I'm okay" and you're not thinking about it s- [SIGH] some little thing will pop up and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and just sort of be there. [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and you -- you think you're get -- you've got a grip on it, you think you're all right --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you think you're handling [SIGH] and then, you know, something shows up and either reminds you of that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- day [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or just reminds you that you're not as safe as you thought you were.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, [SIGH] I don't know if I've really done anything different, I just feel different, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Um, well, I live, um, in Maryland --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not that far from, [NOISE] um, the D -- D -- I'm twenty miles south of D.C.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] And, um -- and, I w- went to church with people that just made it out of the Pentagon --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- um, [SIGH] and it -- I don't think it's changed my life [SIGH] and -- and until I -- like, seve- it was several days later or maybe even a week or more [SIGH] when I actually [MN] was riding -- was on the [NOISE] highway or on route one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and looked over at the Pentagon [SIGH] and, you know -- and just, you know, then -- then it --
R:  It hit you.
L:  -- it became real. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, um --
R:  Well, it took me a long time before I w- actually would go over to that part of New York City.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I would travel around it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would go [SIGH] anywhere and [SIGH] it's very hard for me now to look at pictures.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Still, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, of -- of what used to be there.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's weird, I mean -- I mean, I can see it, but it just -- it doesn't mean anything posi- it doesn't remi- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not a good feeling, let's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- put it that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, [SIGH] but I know it must have been very strange to be -- yeah, that -- yeah, that's [MN] weird.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] It's the idea of having something that was there and you never paid attention to it and then suddenly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  And, I don't know, it just seemed like after that just so many things have happened because --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- um --
R:  I -- I feel for you guys --
L:  Right after --
R:  Down that way.
L:  -- that -- well, was it last year when we had the sniper --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- running around --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  I know. [SIGH] 
L:  -- I think probably maybe that affected me a little bit more because [LIPSMACK] I don't know, that was a little bit close to the home --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I guess. [SIGH] But, uh --
R:  It became -- it became very personal --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- in a --
L:  -- a little bit.
R:  -- in a weird kind of way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because there was -- there -- y- it's not that th- the towers falling --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- made any sense either, but this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that truly didn't make any sense --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to you.
L:  [SIGH] But, um --
R:  And you were afr- I mean, yeah, it's that thing of you don't want to leave your house.
L:  Mhm, [SIGH] yeah.
R:  And you want to hold everybody --
L:  And --
R:  -- really close to you.
L:  -- but it -- it just seems like since, September ele- I don't know, [SIGH] it just seems like since then, just so many [SIGH] other things have happened, or maybe I'm just noticing them more --
R:  [SIGH] Well, you know --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- I thought about that.  I know what you mean, I know what you mean, but I think it's that we, meaning the United States of -- we felt -- we felt vulnerable --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for first time probably in most people's lives.
L:  Well, yeah, 'cause -- yeah, n- you know, and then I -- I listen to the -- some of the people over there and they're saying that we think we're so much [SIGH] and this and that, and you know that you're not --
R:  Not, no.
L:  -- and, you know. [SIGH] So, I don't know, I n- I -- and I guess maybe thinking about things differently --
R:  I think -- I think we all --
L:  -- than before.
R:  -- perceive things differently now.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I think -- I mean, [SIGH] the thing is, I think we all had -- we probably always did --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- look at things differently --
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] but all of a sudden it's like that's -- that's --
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  -- the way you think now.
L:  Yeah, because it seemed like a lo- most things happen somewhere else.
R:  Right
L:  And, uh --
R:  Right, and this time it happened here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I, um -- [SIGH] I -- that part of the world is where I used to [MN] work a lot.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  And so it was -- it was that weird thing of -- of did I know anybody, did I --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, that kind of stuff and-- [SIGH] and more people -- I mean, I used to say, especially right after that happened, I said, [SIGH] "It doesn't matter if you knew somebody personally or not we all kn- we were all connected in some way".
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  You knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in that place and I kind of feel like if people just keep [MN] -- kept that aspect of it in mind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] hat we'd all get -- we'd be finer, we'd be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- better off, we'd be better, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And also [LAUGH] I have to admit, you know, [SIGH] it does put things in perspective, 'cause there were people [SIGH] d- doing stuff and getting angry about little tiny things again and I just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, would look at people and go, "Excuse me.  In light of what just happened --"
L:  Mhm.
R: "-- are you serious about that?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "You're worrying about your seat on the subway?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "You're worrying about you ties, you're worried about -- I mean, come on".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  "You can't be getting angry with somebody about that little thing when that big thing just --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- happened".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, that part of it makes me look at things differently.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, the things that -- that you might have thought were important before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're not important.
L:  Oh, you know, that's true, that's true.
R:  You -- they are not important, and when you start looking at it that way, it's, like, it makes you think about the stuff that -- [SIGH] that's what I think it made people do, is think about what was really important in life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's what people are now starting to forget.
L:  Yeah.  you know what?  That's true, um --
R:  [SIGH] You know, you -- you -- you know, [SIGH] I get mad when I start hearing people talk about, you know, [SIGH] "Well, this person did this and this is --" you know, and it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm like, "Listen. [SIGH] When it comes down to it, nothing's guaranteed". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  [SIGH] "And so you have to appreciate the stuff that you do have, and you have to get rid of all the small stuff". 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's a lot of stuff that's really small.  I know for some people it's like, "No, that's a big deal". [SIGH] But if you really look [LAUGH] at it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- big a deal.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  It's just, you know, there's too much [MN] -- there's -- [SIGH] it's too short --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  That's right.
R:  I'm about to have a birthday on Sunday, a big birthday. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, it's my birthday today. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, happy birthday.
L:  [LAUGH] Thank you.
R:  Good for you.
L:  [LAUGH] And I'd say it's a big one. [LAUGH] 
R:  Is it a five?
L:  I'm going to be fifty four -- I'm fifty four today, yeah.
R:  Uh, and I'm going to be fifty.
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH] 
R:  So, I'm, like, really impressed --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and people like, "Oh, you know, and [SIGH] you keep getting older and you're "
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  and I'm like, "Look --" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- you know, what?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "I'm just happy I'm still here.
L:  Oh, I know, 'cause I remember growing up [SIGH] I thought fifty was old.
R:  Of course we did.
L:  I thought, "Oh, way, I'll be dead by then".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Now, I'm --
R:  I don't think so. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm looking for twenty, thirty more years. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, how about a fifty --
