L:  Hi, I'm Karen.
R:  This is -- you said Karen?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, this is Nicole.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Uh, I'm fine, and yourself? [LAUGH] 
L:  Good, thank you. [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Uh, do you exercise?
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I do during the -- the school, I'm a student.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I do during the school year, but over the summer not really so much. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] How about you? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Mm, I try to, maybe about three to four times a week and I do tae bo. [NOISE] It works really well. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, I do tae bo.
L:  Now, do you do it p- like, specifically for health and fitness, though?  Like, for health and fitness reasons?
R:  [SIGH] No, it's more or less me needing to get in shape. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, that was a -- but that is -- that is health and that's fitness.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's fitness. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And, like, it wasn't  -- it wasn't like I'm [inaudible] to.  Most people work out because the doctor told 'em they had to do it.  I realized I needed to do it because my clothes weren't fitting, mm. [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, see, I, um, during the -- during the school year I dance regularly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I -- 'cause I'm actually a dance minor in school so, I mean, that's pretty regular, but I wouldn't say I do it for health and fitness reasons, I do --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it just 'cause I like to dance.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I mean, I don't know, I've been doing it since I was three, so I've always done it.  But then in the summer it just kind of trails off. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, you -- do you dance the during the summer, you know, during your recreational time?
L:  [MN] No, I should though, and, uh, yeah, I -- I, like, I try to but it's hard to take class over the summer 'cause it's expensive and --
R:  Right. [MN] 
L:  -- I don't know where to go and --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, things like that.
R:  Also, well, you -- you -- you -- sometimes you can feel so unmotivated if you don't have someone to help you out. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, no, that's definitely true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I de- I wanted to go to the gym, but then, with work and everything, it's just -- it's too hard to go.
R:  Yeah, I have an, uh --
L:  And that --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  No, you go, [LAUGH] I was just [MN] I'm sorry.
R:  Uh, uh, we -- I have an agreement with my friends, we all work out together [LAUGH] --
L:  That's really good.
R:  -- over the fall. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's really good.  Over the fall? [LAUGH] 
R:  Over the f- [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] That's funny. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yes, but, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't remember what I was going to say.  That's okay.
R:  Oh, you -- you -- when, uh -- you were explaining to me, um, about the dancing, I think it was -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's just -- I mean, over the summer, like, when I say I would want to join the gym, that is for fitness reasons --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I wouldn't say during the year it necessarily is, it's just, you know, but --
R:  Do you want to do it during the summer? [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I do, I really -- I do, but I don't -- I don't even know if it's the fact that I'm unmotivated, I feel like I really just don't have the time.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know, maybe it is, like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- maybe it is motivation and I'm just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- making excuses.
R:  [SIGH] Uh, no, I know, because during the winter I just -- I have a strong aversion to working out and I don't understand it, I just won't do it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] It's a -- it's a little bit harder for me though in the winter to work out and I don't -- you know, I just really don't do it. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  People just don't want to come out of their houses during the winter [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause it's just a [LAUGH] --
R:  I'm like, "Man, I'm not doing that". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I am, uh, also a lot heavier now since I've -- I have started to do the tae bo regularly because it -- it was -- what -- messing with my self esteem and everything [SIGH] 'cause I was --
L:  Yeah, I know, it makes you feel so much --
R:  Yeah, I was really heavy.
L:  -- better.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah --
L:  Good.
R:  -- I was really heavy.
L:  But --
R:  I was about sixty or seventy pounds overweight and it was ridiculous. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, and now the tae bo's helping, though?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Good.
R:  I finally found something I can do [LAUGH] that I --
L:  Good.
R:  -- enjoy. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's great.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And I enjoy it --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- so much, so 
L:  -- really good.  How long have you been doing it?
R:  Let me see, two years.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Two years, because --
L:  So you [MN] --
R:  [SIGH] it made --
L:  Yeah, [MN] --
R:  -- me feel kinda bad, you know, when I saw the infomercials and they had these little children out there doing these tae bo exercises, I said, "Okay, now, they can do it, I can do it too". [LAUGH] 
L:  That s really good.  Do you do it at a gym, or ?
R:  [SIGH] No, here, uh -- here in my own home.
L:  It --
R:  [MN] 
L:  Oh, and then y-
R:  I cannot -- yeah, I can't imagine doing this in front of people because you look so foolish, but I have a mirror, you know, I can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- see my self working out. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's funny. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I wouldn't do it with a group. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, at home, I just put a mirror up so I can see myself working out and just watch myself [SIGH] progress [SIGH] with each --
L:  Then that's very regular and you've really stuck with that too, 'cause two years that's a long -- like --
R:  I had no --
L:  -- you know, to just work out.
R:  -- choice. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I had no choice. [LAUGH] I got tired of huffing and puffing going up the steps. [SIGH] Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I understand. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But [NOISE] I don't know, every time summer comes around I always say I want to start going to the gym and [SIGH] one of my friends always says, "Yeah, you know, we'll go together and you know it's -- it's good for your heart" and things like that and I'm like, "Yeah" [SIGH] --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- and we get really excited about it when we're talking --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we never actually go.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] It's -- i- it takes -- [MN] I don't know, sometimes you just need a little push to get out there and get going.  For me it was just [MN] not being able to get in my clothes. [SIGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's what I -- that's definitely an incentive.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Not being able to wear my clothes and -- and in fact I usually work out a little bit late in the evening just to --
L:  Do you work out every -- you said three or four times a -- a week?
R:  [SIGH] [MN] Yes. [SIGH] 
L:  That's --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- that's good.
R:  [SIGH] Until I get to a point where I -- you know, the [MN] -- the [LAUGH] [SIGH] why weight isn't -- my overweightness is not a [LAUGH] -- so obvious.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now, do you also, like, diet with eating?  With --
R:  Yes, I've --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- c- um, I've cut out the fat and I'm down on these cookies. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  'Cause I used to -- I was eating a lot of junk food and -- and taking a lot of, um, [SIGH] sugars with the sodas and everything, so I've increased my water [SIGH] and trying to get on fruits and vegetables. [SIGH] It is so --
L:  That's really good.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  See --
R:  -- true, you know, it's almost so drastic, I'm like, "Can I [SIGH] do this?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, no, that's really good.  Now, have you been doing that for three years also?
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, this is the f- the change in diet just started in the last couple of months.
L:  Wow.
R:  Oh. [SIGH] 
L:  Uh, have you noticed a big difference?  Like, did --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- did that really --
R:  It was in, um, I think, uh, mainly -- my main problem, like I said, was, like, the fast food and the cookies, and once I got rid of that, a lot of the weight was coming off along with the exercise, [SIGH] and then when I put a boundary on [SIGH] the amount of time that I -- you know, I don't eat after eight o'clock and that really helped 'cause I was eating all night long --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- from going --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- to school, you know, you develop these bad eating habits. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, you do. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] And that's when it happened to me, I had to change my eating habits [SIGH] [MN] 'cause, you know, school has you eating all [MN] times of the night, all times of the morning, you eat whatever's in your refrigerator. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, no, I -- I completely -- trust me, I completely understand --
R:  Mm. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] But I feel like I don't do -- like, getting back to the question, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever, um, the health and -- like, if you work out for health and fitness, I feel like, um, you'll probably also be dieting too.  Like, [SIGH] I work out because I like to dance and I like -- like it, you know, it's something that I've been doing for a long time, but then I don't watch my diet [LAUGH] any more --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- 'cause [LAUGH] -- do anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- else, 'cause it's -- I'm not doing it for health and -- I'm not doing it for my health, even though I should be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Mhm.  Then how -- wait a minute, I'm doing this exercise but I'm still eating the same thing, how is this helping? [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I feel like that's a lot of -- a lot of people's problems, like, they're just -- you know, they'll do one thing but not the other and then expect to see results and then they get mad when they don't, so then they just go back to their old ways.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, I'm sticking with this.  I have to stick with this, I have to stick with this. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, two years, you've been doing really great.
R:  Y- you know, you know, it's [SIGH] hoo, it's -- it's something, 'cause then my friends dropped off, I said, "Okay, well, if you drop off I still have to keep going". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Now, how many friends do you have doing it?
R:  Three, there's three --
L:  That's --
R:  -- of them. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Um, I'm just curious.  How old are you?  Like --
R:  Tw- [LAUGH] twenty nine. [LAUGH] 
L:  All right. Oh, that's great [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I was just curious 'cause you know, like -- [SIGH] but I feel like the working out thing is definitely a young fad too. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know? [SIGH] No, it really is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- like, older people don't really work out at all.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] It's funny because it was my mother who actually got me back into pushing me to exercise, 'cause --
L:  Really?
R:  -- she works out.  Yeah, so I did have that example, but I don't really see [SIGH] too many older peop- well, I guess I take that back, I do see a lot of them walking, [SIGH] but it's -- 
L:  Yeah, no, yeah [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true, that's true. [LAUGH] 
R:  I see --
L:  I feel like --
R:  -- a lot of 'em walking.
L:  -- they'll probably work out -- like, if you're older, you'd probably work out only if you did when you're -- when you were younger.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like, if you didn't work out when you were younger, you're probably not going to start.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's good that you're doing this now 'cause then maybe, you know, [LAUGH] when you're older [LAUGH] you'll --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you'll keep doing it.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I know, I thought, "I don't want everything to fall to the floor". [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, goodness.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, gosh.
R:  I'm trying really hard to stick with this, though. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, no, that's great.  I w- I mean, I would definitely want to get on a regular gym schedule, but I just think it's too hard with everyth- like, with work and with just -- I -- I -- there's so much stuff, like, you have to do, I feel like that's just too much time.  My brother does it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but he forces himself to go, he's like --
R:  You h- yeah.
L:  -- "I have to go to the gym, I have to go to the gym". [SIGH] And I'm just --
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  -- like, "Uh, [MN] you know " [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Not only that, if he doesn't go they're still going to bill him for it. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's [LAUGH] -- that's [inaudible] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- money h- money definitely comes into it.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's why at school, I di- I went a lot.  I went to the gym a l-
