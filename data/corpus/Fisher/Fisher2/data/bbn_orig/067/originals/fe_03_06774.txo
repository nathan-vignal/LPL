L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Yeah, this is Tom and, um, you know, I guess our topic is what changes have you made, um, you know, in our personal lives, uh, since nine eleven.
L:  Okay, uh, my name is Andrea.
R:  Hi, Andrea.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Um, [SIGH] September eleventh, it really affected my life, first of all, because I work for an airline.
R:  Oh, well, yeah, I'll bet it did.  Yeah.
L:  And it has changed my life in many, many ways and I think, um, mostly negatively. [LIPSMACK] Um, [SIGH] I've had to transfer to a different city as a result of the, um, [LIPSMACK] of the September eleven attacks --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I was based --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in New York --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- during that time.  I was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- he- home in Washington DC when it happened.
R:  Oh, okay.  But, yeah, I guess you -- you just didn't want to fly in and out of New York, uh, any longer?
L:  No, it's not that I didn't want to, it's that the -- the flying became so bad, people just didn't want to fly to New York --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, and so our f- our flights became just non existent and so I had to transfer to another city where there were more flights available --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, and I had to --
R:  And would you go back now?
L:  I would go back once they all get reinstated and they're slowly getting back, though they haven't yet.
R:  Mm. [MN]
L:  And it also affected me money wise, because I was --
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  -- able to fly m- um, better trips and so, um, it has, you know, also affected that, so I've had --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to look for other jobs to do on the side.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, [MN] you know what, I really haven't made that many changes, I guess, in my -- in d- you know, my day to day living.  I guess a little more fearful, a little more apprehensive, uh, you- you're, you know, I guess you look around a little more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Do you, uh, fly a lot? [NOISE]
R:  No, no, no, no, uh, I -- I used to fly more than I -- than I do now.  Actually, I haven't been on a plane since nine eleven.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L: Really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But I've really had no need to, uh --
L:  That's interesting, so your travel was mainly for business?
R:  Uh, business and pleasure, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so, you know, I'd -- I'd, uh, stay close to home.
L:  And do you work, like, in the same city where you live?
R:  Yeah, yeah, I live in Philadelphia and -- and -- and work in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, so, you know, i -- i -- mm, [NOISE] the -- the furthest I go is, like, forty miles, mm. [NOISE]
L:  That's interesting.  So, it hasn't made many changes in terms of travel, what about in other ways?
R:  Yeah, I guess I'm a little more, um, [MN] worrisome, I guess, or -- or --
L:  Do you work in a --
R:  -- or fear-
L:  -- bi- in a bi- tall building?
R:  No, I don't, no --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no, no, tha- that's rare, I mean, di- uh, five stories is, [MN] you know, th- the tallest building I go in, I guess. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  Um, yeah I guess I would worry about that if I worked, uh, you know, i- in a tall building, yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know we have the -- the Liberty Square Towers here, which are, um, I don't know, I guess, fifty five, sixty stories.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Uh ...
L:  But, um --
R:  Which -- which -- which would be a -- a target now, uh --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they're big enough.
L:  Do you feel that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, your city is particularly, uh, vulnerable to a terrorist attack?
R:  Um, no, not really.  Um, you know, unless they wanted to attack, like, a -- a -- a historical site, or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or just li- yeah, hit the stadium full of people at a ball game or something.
L:  Okay, so, you- your anxiety levels haven't really changed too much, just --
R:  No --
L:  -- [inaudible]
R:  -- no, not too much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- no.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mm, for me --
R:  I mean, I --
L:  -- it has --
R:  -- I can understand yours, uh --
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- and, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- being in the national's Capital, it's [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- huge target and -- [SIGH] and it's, um, I remember right after the attacks they had just constant, like, noise, like, you would hear, just the planes going overhead, the fighter planes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you would hear sirens, you would hear just -- so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my -- I've become very stressed out and anxious.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, um, and I think a lot of people in this area that don't need to live here have moved away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to places where they find that are more -- more quiet and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, with the, you know, the -- the -- all the -- the losses at the Pentagon, you know, and, uh, and then you had that sniper.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- we've [LAUGH] --
R:  -- which was unrelated, but --
L:  -- we've had anthrax --
R:  -- uh, yeah.
L:  -- you name it, we've --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had it. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I still like to live here, otherwise, uh, it's -- it's a neat city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, am I more aware of, you know, travelling in the Metro?  Yeah. [NOISE] Luckily I don't have to, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a lot of people commute on Metro and they're worried that something might happen. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, just a, you know, and any kind of gas or germ or whatever, um, yeah, I ra- I rarely use public transportation, I -- I generally just get around by au- by automobile. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Uh, I fly quite a bit, so, I mean I'm -- I commute to work and then I have to fly to -- you know, while I'm working, so, it --
R:  Do you find yourself, like, looking the people over? [LAUGH] You know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- seeing if they look like --
L:  Um --
R:  -- a -- a, you know, the profile of, uh, of that -- those hijackers?  You know?
L:  No, I don't look at the profile because I think that it's going to be somebody who you will not expect.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, maybe a, you know, a blonde, blue eyed American, all American guy, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So I don't go for that stereotype look, you know, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- plus, you know, Washington is a very diverse city so I'm -- I'm used to all the different nationalities and ethni- ethnic backgrounds and everything, so it's not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something that, well, might worry me, but, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on an airplane.  Like, the other day we had a couple on the plane that were clearly, they were Arabs, they had on their, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] or, you know, their -- their clothing, their typical clothing and, um, so when I started talking to them and the guy was very old and, um, and his wife and they were travelling to the west coast to see his son --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he was telling me that he lived in Saudi Arabia --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but that didn't -- I mean, that didn't bother me, I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- just because he was an Arab, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  But certainly if you saw five or six [MN] you know, um, thirty year old guys, uh, you know, getting on together as a group, I mean, yeah.  I -- I -- I think I would be worried --
L:  Well --
R:  -- a- as a --
L:  -- they --
R:  -- passenger.
L:  -- they could be -- they could be students, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Washington we have a lot of those, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I would look more at what they're doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than what -- than what they are -- what they look like.  I mean, I actually had a terrorist on an airplane one time and -- he wasn't working, though, thank God --
R:  [LAUGH] Wow.
L:  -- he was just getting to and from and [MN] with his little group, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there were a group of, like, six of them [SIGH] and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were all dressed kind of the same, except the turban colors were different on their heads.
R:  Hm.
L:  And this was the guy who did the bombing of the, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] the Air Canada [NOISE] flight that went from Toronto to, um, and I think it was going to India via London [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  An- and -- and -- and -- and he was --
L:  And they got bombed --
R:  -- actually part of it?
L:  -- yeah, uh, what they did was this guy checked in and he said the agent, "Can I just check in my bag, um, all the way through?" --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and he had a ticket point to p-
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the agent --
R:  So they -- they were suspicious --
L:  -- the agent --
R:  -- of the bag?
L:  -- let him and she was -- she was at fault, actually over the whole thing, because you're not supposed to do that, you're supposed to check point to point --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he -- of course he got off in Toronto and the flight went on with his bags, which had a bomb --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and killed.  It -- up until September eleventh that was the biggest air disaster.
R:  Oh, my. [NOISE]
L:  And, um, so this guy, he was the mastermind, he was on our flight to Frankfurt and the only reason I knew who he was was because when I got back to my hotel room, I had a Life magazine and I started reading it [NOISE] and I saw his picture [LAUGH] in the Life magazine explaining who he was --
R:  Oh, my goodness --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he was -- he was already on the flight and the flight's over --
L:  He already, you know, was on his way to India --
R:  -- well away.
L:  -- he was going on to India and they were protesting the whole, they wanted to separate India from the c- Cashmere region [NOISE] from India or whatever it was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- their -- their, um, [NOISE] their issue and he and his, uh, friends, they were all travelling under the same name, Patel --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- which is an Indian Hindu name, which is not an Arabic name --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and so it was obviously a fake, you know, a fake name and all that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, the authorities --
R:  But it's such a common name, i- it's like "Smith", isn't it?
L:  Right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- very common.  So, the authorities when we got to Germany were very interested in listening to me and to the, um, the -- the person who was in charge of the flight, she had also noticed that there something strange about them and she looked at the picture and also identified him from the picture. [NOISE]
R:  Hm.  But by then it was --
L:  And he was --
R:  -- no -- there --
L:  -- asking me questions about, which I thought was weird, about the airplane.
R:  Hm.
L:  He kept asking me about, like, about the bathrooms, about, just weird things, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just, strange questions --
R:  Yeah.  Probably plane --
L:  -- but that kinda -- that stuck in my mind --
R:  Yeah, he -- he was looking for a place to hide something, to -- you know, to hide an explosive, or whatever.
L:  I don't know, that stuck in my mind and I remember, you know, w- well, when I saw the picture I w- immediately called the -- the lady in charge and -- and then talked to her about it and she said, "Yes, I remember them, because when they came on they were also asking me questions about exits and stuff like that", so --
R:  Mm.
L:  But I would be more in tune to those types of things than what they look like.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, and you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I always go with my gut instinct. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I have taken people off flights that I felt were not okay.
R:  Uh-huh.  And then they're just questioned and e- either get on another flight or ...
