L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Katie.
R:  Hi, my name's Roxanne.
L:  Hi, Roxanne.  Um [LAUGH] is this your first time, or ...?
R:  Second actually.
L:  Second.  This is my first. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [COUGH] Excuse me.  Um --
R:  Actually --
L:  -- so I guess we --
R:  -- this is a little bit easier topic than, ah -- than what I had before. [LAUGH]  I had affirmative --
L:  What -- what did you have the first time?
R:  -- action last time. [LAUGH]
L:  What did you have the first time?
R:  I had affirmative action.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I was speaking to someone who I -- I think is an immigrant so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- it was really sort of difficult.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, ah, I don't know.  Are you from the east coast or the west?
L:  No, west.  You're from east?
R:  Oh, okay.  Me too.  Yeah, I'm from Phoenix.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, ah --
L:  Okay did you -- 'cause your voice sounds a little eastern.
R:  Yeah, I'm from Buffalo originally so, ah --
L:  Oh, okay, that explains it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I -- I sort of identify with a lot of this, but, ah, knowing friends and, ah, people back east I think it's --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- a totally different matter when it's sitting right in front of you than when you watch it on television.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Yeah, it's just -- just very, very hard and, ah -- I don't know, you know, I, ah, I see people who personalize it even though they're not from New York, to a very great degree.  Like, kids who injure themselves and things like this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- over September eleventh, and that, ah -- that sort of makes me very sad 'cause, ah --
L:  Yes.  My --
R:  -- I think there's some --
L:  -- actually --
R:  -- people who can't control their, ah, reactions to it and immediately personalize it and feel very insecure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's very sad.
L:  Yeah.  And my son who's just turned eight, um, I -- I didn't let him watch anything on TV, but he is -- ever since then constantly talking about bad guys and what he's going to do to them.
R:  Wow.
L:  I mean, just constantly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, well, okay, constantly's a little exaggeration but [LAUGH] it feels like that to me.
R:  Well, I mean we're involved in a war now too.  So, ah --
L:  Right.  That too.
R:  You know?
L:  But ever -- ever since the September eleventh I -- and -- and I guess he and his friends, you know, talked a lot about Osama Bin Laden for a long time.  But as for doing anything different, I really don't.  I mean I have so much going on I don't really think about it that much. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean I -- I --
L:  I mean I certainly did at the time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and, um --
R:  You know, I think there's a certain reflection in how you really aren't in control of your life.  
L:  Right.
R:  And there are certain things that are totally outside the realm of --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- possibilities that -- of controlling and, ah, you know, I think among people who are very, very close to it, ah, you know, I -- I think there may be a certain amount of, ah, I -- I don't know, reflection or despair or whatever but, um, you know, I -- I -- I guess I can't personalize it that much more.  I -- I've -- since, ah, actually about three months later I developed cancer so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I had another [LAUGH] uncontrollable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- situation.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  So, um, you know, it's just sort of another illustration of how --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you really aren't in much control.  Um --
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R: -- but I guess I've seen a lot of other people that have -- have -- it's affected, ah, in a much more negative way and I don't know, I guess -- I guess you can lose a lot of your freedom of life when you personalize it to -- to a greater --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- degree.
L:  I would -- I would definitely think so.  And I just -- yeah.  Yeah, you've got -- I mean, you have to go on with your life and then if something else happens you'll just have to deal with that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I suppose.
R:  Oh, yeah, there's no question.
L:  So -- I know this is off the topic, but how's -- how are you doing?
R:  I'm actually in remission right now.
L:  Good.
R:  I'm not doing too badly, so --
L:  Good, I'm glad. [NOISE]  Um --
R:  I had this like six month's of chemo where I was sleeping [LAUGH] constantly and --
L:  Oh, I bet.
R:  -- I went back to work.  So then all I did was work and sleep, but, ah --
L:  Wow, wow.
R:  But I'm okay now.  So I'm hoping --
L:  Oh good.
R:  -- you know, and -- and that's another thing where it's like, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Oh great.  Henry, this is part of a study and I need to -- Henry, stop.  [NOISE] Oh boy.
R:  But you're sort of tossed around I think and, ah --
L:  Pardon me? [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, hope for the best.  It's, ah --
L:  Yes, definitely.
R:  -- it's one of those things.  So, I don't know.  It's -- it's very tough.  I think, ah, among people from New York, ah, you know just friends I know and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and people that are closer to home, I think, ah, they've all had either relatives or very close friends or whatever, and I think that -- that takes it into a whole different dimension where you're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doing a lot of personal, ah --
L:  Oh, it has to.
R:  -- personal mourning.
L:  It has to.
R:  You know, and, ah, and -- and that is really tough.  But, ah, I don't know I just, ah, they talk about things like getting the sheeting and clos- -- and closing your house, and see --
L:  Oh that, yeah.
R:  -- and in that way I have a very fatalistic idea where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they pick my town, they pick my town and that's it.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I just, ah -- I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hope that, ah, wiser minds prevail.  And I'm -- I'm very, um -- I was planning to go to Europe next year for the first time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I don't know that I will. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, right. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I just --
L:  Well, there's --
R:  -- worry about the reception of Americans -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- with -- with all the other stuff that goes on, ah --
L:  I know.  Yeah, they were pretty sympathetic to us there for a while.  Henry -- I'm having some problems here.
R:  Oh --
L:  Henry, don't.
R:  -- that's okay.
L:  Henry, you give that to me -- you know what, you're not supposed to throw things. [NOISE]  Sometimes I just really wonder.  Do you have kids?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they're older -- I'm --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- older, so --
L:  But you went through --
R:  My youngest is seventeen.
L:  -- like eight years old. [NOISE]
R:  So [LAUGH]
L:  Ouch.  You -- Henry that's enough.  That's rude.  [NOISE] Stop. [NOISE] Not now.  Anyway, um, so, ah -- please stop.  Yeah, actually when I heard about the -- the advice about the sheeting and everything [NOISE] my response was not exactly, um, like, "Oh, let's go out and get some right now". [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I was more like, "Oh, give me a break, I've got [LAUGH] enough other things to think about".  So, um, I mean I don't -- I don't ignore it, but I just sometimes -- I probably shouldn't say this, but I just sometimes wonder if maybe that -- Henry -- if, um, you know, some -- stop it.  I -- I'm sorry. [MN]
R:  That's okay.  Don't worry about it.
L:  Oh, my gosh. [NOISE]  Henry stop, that's enough. [NOISE]  Oh, honey, careful.  Um, anyway [NOISE] -- you can just stop right now. [NOISE]  No you may not. [NOISE]  Henry, stop right now. [NOISE]  I -- I think actually if he makes it to adulthood he's going to be just fine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  They eventually do but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  -- and different things vary. [LAUGH]
L:  But [NOISE] -- oh, my gosh. [NOISE]  [SIGH] Anyway, I'm sorry.  Okay, so, um [SIGH] I'm sorry I sort of got off track there didn't I? [NOISE]
R:  That's okay.
L:  [NOISE] I think I should have given them my work phone number or something during the day.  Um, ah I -- I'm sorry I'm completely off track now 'cause he's like going around the house and [NOISE] -- Henry, you need to stop now. [NOISE]  You need to stop --  Do you think ten minutes is almost [LAUGH] up?
R:  It should be almost up I would think.
L:  Yeah.  Um, anyway, um [NOISE] yeah I -- [COUGH] [NOISE] excuse me. [COUGH] [NOISE]  Um [SIGH] ah, I for- -- oh boy, okay.  Um [LIPSMACK] what was I going to say?  Oh, I ju- ju- -- I guess just that I knew a couple of people. [NOISE]  Henry, stop it. [NOISE]  I knew ju- -- a couple of people back east and I, you know, wrote to them and expressed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my sympathy.  And they were, you know, obviously very grateful for it --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- but that's really the only contact I had with --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- anybody back there.  And, um -- and I -- I did find myself listening to my radio with the headphones on at work quite a lot during those first -- you know, especially the first few days afterwards.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean somebody brought a television to work and --
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah.
R:  -- it was just like --
L:  Yeah, that would be really distracting.
R:  -- mesmerizing.  Actually it reminded me 'cause I'm --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I'm from like older when Kennedy was shot.  You know it was the same type, ah --
L:  I remember -- all I still -- 
R:  -- type thing.
L:  I was in third grade.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I was thirteen and, ah --
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  -- you know, it was just, ah -- you remember what you were supposed to do that night, where you were when you heard, everything.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  You know --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- we had a dance cancelled and all this stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So it's just --
L:  Yes, it's --
R:  -- it's life changing yet, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.  You know, it -- there's just so much uncertainty now.  I mean, I do feel sor- -- I know, ah, some minority individuals who are for example Indian, who, ah, you know, are mistaken for Easterners and so, ah --
L:  Yes.  And well, are you going to -- I mean --
R:  -- some of them have shaved off their beards and things of this sort --
L:  Oh, that's awful.
R:  -- and I think that's really unfortunate too, but, ah --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, there's, ah -- there are people who react very strongly and, ah --
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- and I don't know what's --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- what's going to happen.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, ah --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I don't know --
L:  Anyway, ah -- [NOISE] Henry, okay you need to -- oh, that -- that's unacceptable.  You need to stop right now.  That's unacceptable and when I get off the phone you're getting a time out.  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  [NOISE] Sorry about that.  This [LAUGH] is all being recorded, right? [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.  Well, I don't know --
L:  For posterity.
R:  -- actually.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I'm not sure if they're recording the whole thing or not --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- to tell you the truth.
L:  -- a- -- okay.
R:  But, ah, I am [inaudible] you know?
L:  Henry, Henry. [NOISE]  Anyway, um [NOISE] so this was going well there for a while. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I should know better.
R:  That's okay.  Well, and you know I thought this would be an ideal time but it's all -- there's always something going on and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, you just cannot predict it, so --
L:  Yeah, I thought it would be a good time t- -- well, 'cause he's supposed to be asleep by now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's why I thought it would be a good time.
R:  Well, that's right.  'Cause it's -- oh, that's true.  It's almost ten o- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  Yeah he should --
R:  -- nine o'clock whatever.
L:  Yeah, he has to get up --
R:  -- ten o'clock.
L:  -- at six so he --  Anyway I'm sorry --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that's way off the subject.  Um [LIPSMACK] trying to think of anything else.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um [SIGH] it just -- you know, it just really -- I mean every once in a while -- it's not like I never think about it.  But, then it just -- it -- by now it seems very unreal in a -- in a way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean it -- as far as directly affecting me is concerned.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, I know it happened and I remember listening to the news, but I really don't do anything different is what it all boils down to.
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- I think, ah -- I -- I think sort of my personal experiences this last year have affected my life more than, ah, nine eleven actually --
L:  Oh absolutely.
R:  -- had, you know?  And, ah, it's, ah -- I guess you just sort of value things a l- -- a little bit more.  I mean I certainly do feel bad there's an awful lot of women who's husbands they lost and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with children that hadn't been --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- born and things like that.  You know, I usually like pick up People every once in a while --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and see, ah -- see these families and I -- I think that's very terrible also, 'cause I think, ah, you know, families that are just ripped ap- --
