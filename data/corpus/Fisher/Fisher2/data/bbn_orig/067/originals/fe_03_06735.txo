R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Julie, um --
L:  Hi, Julie --
R:  I'm in --
L:  --my --
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Hi, Julie, this is Ethel and I'm in California.
R:  Hi, Ethel, how are you?
L:  I am fine thanks.
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  We're a long ways apart here.
R:  I know, I know. [SIGH] As far as exercise I -- I have a -- I was in a -- a car accident many years ago, so [SIGH] I -- I do need to exercise, um, in order to keep my muscles toned so the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- back area doesn't hurt, so [SIGH] I do what I can, which is [MN] mostly walking and I -- I also have a walking machine here [SIGH] that I use and, [SIGH] um, [MN] very -- very mild knee bends and [MN] things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do you do?
L:  [SIGH] Uh, first, may I ask you how old you are?
R:  Uh, forty two.
L:  Forty two, okay. [SIGH] 
R:  I'm sorry, forty three, I just turned forty three.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, no I thought it was kind of interesting 'cause we have a similar situation because [SIGH] um, I also have to exercise moderately because I have M.S. and so I'm not able to do the normal type of exercise --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] such as working out in a gym or something like that --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and it sounds like you're in the s- same type of situation.
R:  Right.  Do you tire easily with that?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  Very much so. [SIGH] Um, but, like, you, I do the same thing, I --
R:  Low impact.
L:  -- I try to walk.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I try to walk, y- you know, each day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, in the past, of course, I -- I was very active, I played tennis and I skied and everything else, but that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- way too hard on me so you just kind of have to learn to [SIGH] change your -- your style of living.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] And so --
R:  And accept it, I think that was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the biggest thing for me was [SIGH] accepting it.  I had to or else I -- I st- was hurting myself [SIGH] actually.
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH] I used --
L:  Right, you --
R:  -- to ski too and -- and --
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] and, um --
L:  Yeah, we just --
R:  -- it was just too -- it's too dangerous, it's --
L:  Yeah, you just learn you kinda -- you know, I kept trying to push myself and I just kept feeling worse and getting worse, so, you know, the body is telling you, "Hey, we can't do this any more".
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So, you kinda have to slow down and I just -- you know, I do walking and [SIGH]-- have you tried taking yoga classes because I've done that --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and that's kind of -- basically it's stretching is what it is, and it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- easier on your body than doing any kind of aerobic type exercise.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] I did that years and years ago and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I enjoyed it, maybe I should look into it again. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] 
L:  There are classes for people that, you know, have physical problems, so it's kind of like a slow stretch type yoga, not a real heavy duty where you go upside down, all those kind of --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- crazy things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] But I found that that -- that works out okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] I also -- I tried tai chi. [SIGH] Um, that, like, uses every muscle in your body and it's -- you just kind of moves real slow, kind of a meditative sort of thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- although it's kind of hard on you because you really ache all over from using every muscle in the body.
R:  But they don't -- they don't work you out strenuously, right?  Is it [NOISE] --
L:  No, no, it's not strenuous, it's very slow. [SIGH] Um, so that might be something you could --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- too.
R:  I'll definitely look into that.
L:  Um, but t- to me, I think yoga's probably the easiest, because it's basically just stretching, [LIPSMACK] but --
R:  But right now you just walk?
L:  Yeah, walking, you know, you just kinda --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- the old story, if --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- if you don't use it, you'll [LAUGH] -- you lose it --
R:  Right, right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so you just got to -- just kinda moving slowly and taking it easy, just so you're doing something.
R:  Right.
L:  That's the thing, if you just [SIGH] lie around, like, even you, with your back problem, [SIGH] if you just did that --
R:  It's hard because when -- you know, w- there are times that I've had to because the pain is -- is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty bad. [SIGH] Like, I get -- I go for, um, [SIGH] uh, cortisone injections once a month --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- and I'm also going for the Botox treatments, [SIGH] so it's pretty bad, but I -- you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I -- I also feel that when I don't move around, it -- it's as if I age twenty years --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  --  in a week, so --
L:  -- then you get stiff.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  I think that happens -- [SIGH] I think that happens to anybody even if there's nothing really wrong with you, if you don't do anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, everything kinda stops working, it's -- you got to keep everything well oiled or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- unless -- or everything --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- breaks down, you know? [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's nice, though, with the weather getting nicer here, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, lifts your spirits and makes you want to move and get up and do things, so 
L:  Oh, for sure, plus when you -- [SIGH] well, you kind of feel better when you're moving around and then that makes you [SIGH] uh, you know, look better --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then you feel better about yourself too.
R:  How is the weather there now?
L:  Oh, it's lovely, very nice --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- here.
R:  Good, good.
L:  Yeah, it's always nice here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] I know it's raining back there, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, it's been --
L:  [SIGH] But do you find --
R:  -- raining for, like, a week now. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you [MN] find that, um, [MN] you have difficulty exercising with the -- the dampness?  Does that bother your back --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- at all?
R:  -- I feel the dampness.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah. [SIGH] But then you do exercise indoors, I mean --
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  -- do -- you said you have, like, an exercise bike --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you ride?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  [MN] [SIGH] Well, not a bike, it's a -- it's the walker, um [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, like a treadmill?
R:  [MN] Like, yeah, the treadmill I have.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  [SIGH] So, we use that.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I have children too, so they keep --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- me going.
L:  Well, that's good --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I'm sure they give you plenty of exercise.
R:  Mhm.  Do you have children?
L:  [SIGH] Well, I have a daughter who's thirty four and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have a grandson who's nine.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, he keeps --
R:  he keeps you busy, huh?
L:  -- me busy.  Oh, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And then, what about -- I know it was basically they said health and fitness and I think basically they asked exercise, but I [SIGH] wonder if they said --
R:  Talking about vitamins?
L:  -- anything about diet too, as far as --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] eating.  What you eat.
R:  Oh. [MN] 
L:  Because it kind of goes hand in hand --
R:  Oh absolutely.
L:  -- that's my opinion, if --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- [SIGH] I mean, I've been a vegetarian for the past fifteen years, [LIPSMACK] and I don't --
R:  And --
L:  -- I don't eat any read meat and --
R:  And you're okay with that?
L:  Yeah, I am --
R:  Good.
L:  -- lots of fruits and vegetables and [SIGH] go to the farmers' market in my town and buy organically grown food and --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, very good.
L:  -- I always read the labels on packages at the market to see --
R:  Oh, that's smart --
L:  -- the fat content --
R:  I definitely do that.
L:  -- and all that. 
R:  [SIGH] I've -- I've started to do that in the past --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- like, five years, I --
L:  I think it's really a good idea --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- I mean, if you're going to take care of your body, not with just exercise, you should also take care with it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- take care of it with what you put into it. [SIGH] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I've started to take coral calcium, which is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- good. [SIGH] It's-- it's made me feel a little bit better.  I'm --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- I'm feeling a little bit of a difference, it's -- the pain level has gotten, [SIGH] um, a little bit better.  Tolerable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So  [SIGH] 
L:  Well, once you have a car injury, a car accident with a back injury [MN] it doesn't go away fast.
R:  No. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I have a friend who recently -- who had the same thing --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- maybe about three or four --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- months ago and he's -- he's still hurting too.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  It's a slow process.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But do you have physical therapy for it --
R:  Oh, I've -- I've --
L:  -- or did you?
R:  -- over the years, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did that help?
R:  I mean, basically I know what I'm supposed to do and what not to do and [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when I push it what [NOISE] to do, and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know, [SIGH] [NOISE] I'm just very happy to be alive, honestly.
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  I -- y- you know, I -- I put up with the pain. [SIGH] I was left here for a reason, I think. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Well, with my M.S. it's the same thing, it's -- you know, you get down about it and you say, "Hey, you know, [SIGH] uh, this is just what happened and I'm just going to have to live with it and, um --"
R:  Now, when did you find out you --
L:  "-- do the best to have --"
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I've had it for thirty years --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.
R:  -- since I was twenty nine years old.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Long time, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, uh, I'm still hanging in there and, like, I --
L:  Are they coming up with anything --
R:  [SIGH] Well, there's some --
L:   -- new?
R:  -- they've found some medications, but it doesn't really help that much, you know, I don't even take them. [SIGH] Um, not too many people do 'cause of the side effects --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, the old story of any drug you take --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- has side effects.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So --
R:  [SIGH] Now with the M.S. the h- what does that affect you now, with --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- is it the muscles or --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- nerves?
L:  -- well, it's a -- it's the central nervous system, but it does affect the muscles, it makes your arms and legs very weak and the fatigue and all, [SIGH] --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  -- so exercise does help it, I've found --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's better to do a little something than to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- do nothing at all. [SIGH] I think --
R:  [LIPSMACK] And you said you take vitamins, then, too?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, I do the vitamin bit too, yeah I --
R:  Good.
L:  -- take multi vitamins and vitamin E and, you know --
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  -- [SIGH] and vitamin C and calcium and all that kind of stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, [SIGH] you know, I think once you get into the whole routine of eating right and exercising right it kinda all goes together. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I know people who do none of it and I can tell you all the diseases they have too. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [SIGH] And all the problems they have, so [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] it's better --
R:  do you belong to any support groups at all?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yes, oh sure.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  I -- over the years I've done that, sure.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  That helps.  Are you doing that too, with your back?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, not really. [MN] No, I don't know if that would help me, um --
L:  You don't think so?
R:  -- [SIGH] I just don't like to dwell on it, honestly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the more I find that --
L:  Get involved with --
R:  [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, it's better to get involved in other things and keep --
R:  Right.
L:  -- your mind off it.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, well, you say you have children, you probably have all kinds of things going on --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- with kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] It --
R:  [SIGH] I mean, I was involved when the -- you know, when it first happened with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- support groups and things like that --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, good.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  Yeah, well, that's how I was --
R:  -- you know, it -- it helped to [SIGH] look at -- look at other people and say, you know, you're very lucky that --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, and not to --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- complain and just --
L:  That's --
R:  move on.
L:  -- very important in the beginning, you say, "Gee, it -- it could have been worse --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- and there's people just like me and they've learned to cope so I'll learn to cope too".
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Well, good, it sounds like you're doing okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good.
R:  So, what kind of work do you do?
L:  [SIGH] Well, I'm on disability because of the M.S. --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I don't work, so I have lots of time to do what I want to do and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- enjoy my life and --
R:  Good for you.
L:  -- [SIGH] do all kinds of hobbies and things.
R:  Have you lived there --
L:  So --
R:  -- [MN] all your life?
L:  Oh, yeah, I've always lived in California, love it here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, good.
L:  Very happy.
R:  And you've got family there then I guess, right?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I sure do.
R:  Oh.
L:  They're all here. 
R:  Good.
L:  And you're happy back there in New York?
R:  [SIGH]
