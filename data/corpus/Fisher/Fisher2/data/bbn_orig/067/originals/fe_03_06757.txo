R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Mindy.
R:  I'm Michelle. [SIGH] 
L:  Hi Michelle, where are you at?
R:  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, I'm in Pennsylvania.  How are you? [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm [MN] hot. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It's about a hundred today. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh, my gosh, it's only about fifty five here. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] That's it, I'm moving. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, September eleventh. [SIGH] Um, [LIPSMACK] this is going to sound like a stupid change, but this is -- came as a suggestion from one of my coworkers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that is to keep a full tank of gas.
R:  [NOISE] That is what my husband does.
L:  Really?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  That
R:  He does. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I never even thought of until my coworker said you really should --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- because if they stop shipping oil and you're stuck with an empty tank then you're not going to have any gas, and I'm like, "Well --"
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  "-- that makes sense, so "
R:  That, and we started storing water, which we probably should have started before. [NOISE] 
L:  Mm.
R:  For the -- because of the earthquakes and things. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  But we didn't -- we never did before, 'cause I guess you just get used to [NOISE] saying there's going to be an earthquake and ignoring. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Huh.  No, that's really the only thing I do --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, I haven't quit --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- doing anything, really.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I never traveled, so that wasn't an issue.
R:  [NOISE] Mm, I hesitate to -- to travel.  We've got family on the east coast, we've got family in -- [SIGH] actually, my husband's family's in Egypt right now, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness. [SIGH] 
R:  So we -- they wanted his -- they wanted us to send the kids to -- to Egypt for the summer, and I said, "No --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- not my kids".
L:  I don't think so.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] No, I wouldn't.,
R:  Actually, I said, "Are you nuts?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  "If you want to see 'em, come out here". [LAUGH] 
L:  It would be a neat trip for them, though.
R:  Yeah, it just --
L:  Under normal circumstances.
R:  Not with a war going on and [LAUGH] --
L:  No, no.
R:  -- things like that. [NOISE] So, they'll have to miss out until -- at least until all that's over.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I do find that -- and I try not to be a prejudiced person, but I -- I find that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I look at people --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- differently now.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  If they seem out of place [MN] I tend to put my guard up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I probably shouldn't do that, but at the same time --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I try not to be --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, discriminatory, but at the same time I -- I --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] make sure I know what's going on. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] I think everybody's doing that lately. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems kinda --
L:  And that's terrible, I mean, I feel bad for -- for --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- people that, you know, are of --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- Arabic descent or whatever, and they're over here for legitimate reasons and, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they don't support what went on and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, they're still being discriminated against [NOISE] but --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] you know. [SIGH] 
R:  It's hard to -- it's hard to see, you know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You never know because about the time you trust somebody is -- they're going to be the one. [NOISE] 
R: Yeah.
L:  You know, it's -- it's hard to trust people right now.
R:  [NOISE] I'm not good at trust anymore. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I don't blame you.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, especially when it comes to the kids --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know if, um -- are you near a nuclear power plant?
R:  Um, I'm not near a nuclear plant, I'm near an air force base, though. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay, well, see --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I'm Harrisburg, so we have, um, the army work haulage, we have --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, Fort Indiantown gap, we have all kinds of, you know --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- army navy, all kinds of stuff around here, you know, training bases and everything and, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [SIGH] we also have Three Mile Island, which is [SIGH] a nuclear power plant and it's probably about twelve miles from my house, so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- they've had --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, like, the kids come home form school with --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] permission slips to be given -- I forget what the name of the medicine is, but it's supposed to protect their thyroid if there is a nuclear accident.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, talk about scary, trying to explain to your kids what's coming home from school and, "Well, you know, if you hear this funny siren " [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know, there for a while, every time a fire whistle would go off, he's like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Is that three Mile Island?"  And it's like, "No, it's -- that's not Three Mile Island" so 
R:  Yeah, n- my -- with my daughter, she's real sensitive to -- you know, to anything, so everything worries her.
L:  Mm.
R:  [SIGH] My son's just kind of, [MN] "Oh, you know, whatever".  He's [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, boys --
R:  He's --
L:  -- tend to be that way.
R:  He's ten, he doesn't [LAUGH] -- it doesn't faze him. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, the -- both of them were born on the b- on the base and it's -- it's kind of scary, 'cause we're maybe [NOISE] three miles from it. [NOISE] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know they -- they used to have warheads there --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but it's a retired base now, so I don't know [NOISE] what all they have there anymore. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, it's hard to say.
R:  But I know some of -- some of the troops were flying out from there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, it's like, "Stay away from the [LAUGH] -- that base, and " [NOISE] 
L:  It's hard though, when you -- when you live right there --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and [SIGH] it's also hard, like, I'm in the -- I'm realtor, so, you know, we --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- a lot of our business comes from military.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Now, and everybody's leaving right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So it -- it's kind of hard, but, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know, it -- it's weird because you just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you -- I hate it when I'm driving down the highway and you see --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, caravans --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, camouflaged caravans going by or you see these --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- big semi trucks --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- carrying --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- this tarped load and it's like --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- "Oh, god, I don't even want to know what that --"
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- just keep going".
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I mean, I -- hopefully we're over the worst of it though.
R:  [NOISE] I think so. [LAUGH] I --
L:  I hope.
R:  -- my husband was in the first [NOISE] -- first -- first Gulf War --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- while I was pregnant [NOISE] with my daughter and that was -- that was scary. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, he --
L:  I -- I couldn't imagine.  I remember just at the time --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that happened --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I was just so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- flabbergasted.  I -- I guess, you know, --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- [MN] the first time you really deal with war, and I'm not military, so, you know, I -- I haven't spent my life preparing for that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and, you know, it's just --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it's weird.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  You think it never -- it'll never happened to you.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. [SIGH] I think my husband still -- it doesn't -- it doesn't faze him, [NOISE] it's not -- he doesn't do anything different except for the gas, [NOISE] yeah, like you said, he [NOISE] keeps a full tank all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But other than that, I said, "Aren't you worried?" 'Cause he plans on going over to Egypt f- to visit, and [NOISE] I said, "Aren't you worried?"  "No, [LAUGH] not me".
L:  Well, you know, actually my husband's co worker, her, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- boyfriend is Egyptian --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and they took a month's vacation over to Egypt.  Oh, when was that? 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Earlier in the spring, late -- late winter, early spring --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and we were all worried about her, you know, and -- but she says they had a wonderful time, everybody was so --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- hospitable and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, I had people from the office and one went to London and one went to France just in --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- like, March --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and they said they had no problems --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that everybody was -- you know, they were Americans and everybody was happy to take their money. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So 
R:  [SIGH] Well, that's how -- that's how my --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my husband's father is.  He's -- he's, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] over there doing something with computers.
L:  [NOISE] Ph.
R:  And, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] he says, "Oh, they're happy to take our money". [LAUGH] 
L:  Absolutely.
R:  He says, "They're f- really friendly and happy". [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, they haven't -- I guess they haven't encountered anything [SIGH] -- I'm --
L:  Negative.
R:  -- I don't know.  I say everyone -- they said everyone's nice and [NOISE] [SIGH] the thing I'd like is they have servants. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, you're kidding me.
R:  They said you have to in that country because of the sand. [SIGH] It gets everywhere and [NOISE] one person can't keep up with it. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you've got -- somebody's got to help out, so 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I said, "I could get used to that". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, it would be nice, wouldn't it?
R:  [LAUGH] "Yes, I'll do that, yeah". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Tell them to bring some servants back with them when they come back. [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] Mm, she said it -- my mother in law says it  -- [NOISE] that was hard to get used to, you know, [NOISE] telling someone what to do. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Come in and clean your house and tell 'em, [NOISE] "Okay, do this, this and this".  And she says, "And I felt so, like, bad [NOISE] because --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- I was ordering someone around". [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  But that's what they expect.
R:  And they t- they told -- they -- she finally told her, she said, "That's my job you pay me to --to d- to do this, [SIGH] you need [NOISE] -- you have to tell me what to do". [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] And she says, "Now I'm g- I'm kinda getting used to it and " [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-oh, and then she'll have to come home, right? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I said, that's what I said, [NOISE] "D- you're going to come home and [LAUGH] [SIGH] what are you going to do?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, [LAUGH] she'll go hire herself a housekeeper. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, [MN] I guess [SIGH] it's affordable over there, here it costs you and arm and a leg.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [NOISE] Otherw-
L:  Well, I think over there it's just, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- an expected way of life --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- too.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  You know.
R:  That, and they said you don't drive over there 'cause they don't -- [LAUGH] there are no rules of the road. [LAUGH]    
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] He said the two land highway they use, they turn it into [NOISE] a six lane highway.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE] It's basically wherever you fit on the road [NOISE] is where you drive. [NOISE] 
L:  Wow.
R:  If you can fit your car through [NOISE] then you can go. [NOISE] 
L:  Huh, [SIGH] now do they see much military action going on over there?  Or not necessarily action, but are there -- are there -- is there a presence over there?
R:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] he s- he was here a couple of weeks ago for a visit, and he said [NOISE] [SIGH] it's not really any different [NOISE] now that --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- now that the war has [NOISE] -- has started [NOISE] 'cause he went way be- [NOISE] he went before everything had started. [NOISE] 
L:  Right.
R:  And he says it hasn't been any different. [NOISE] 
L:  Hm.
R:  But he was [NOISE] right there on nine eleven, he was about --
