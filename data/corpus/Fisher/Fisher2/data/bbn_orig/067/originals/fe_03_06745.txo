R:  This is Arnie Smith Rapaport.
L:  Hi, this is Brenda Sitner from Missouri.
R:  Hi, Brenda.  I'm from Connecticut.
L:  How are you?
R:  Great, and you?
L:  Just fine.
R:  Excellent.  I've never done one of these before, have you?
L:  [LAUGH] I did one other one. [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  Let's see we're supposed to talk about what changes we've made since nine eleven.
R:  Okay --
L:  Um -- 
R:  You wanna start?
L:  I really can't say that I've made any changes except for I am definitely more leary of flying now. 
R:  Oh, real- okay.  Has that like, uh, kept you from like going on any flights or it's just more like --
L:  Well, y- -- I mean --
R:  More concerned.
L:  -- kind of but not really.  I mean, I never flew much anyway.  I've --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- probably only flown about three times but --
R:  Gotcha.
L:  I would be a little bit more [SIGH] leary of flying.
R:  Okay.
L:  H- how about you?
R:  Uh, I d- -- I don't do much flying.  Usually probably under ten times a year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I could definitely say, uh, after that happened kind of looking [LAUGH] -- looking around more, I guess, while [LAUGH] about to board the flight.  I'm kinda like, "Hey, who's going on this flight with me?" [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and well also another thing is that I don't know that I've changed but noticed that just people they kind of forget right away.  Like they're very frustrated with how long it takes to go through security and I'm -- I'm totally okay with the fact that, you know, some people get pulled out of line, "You need to take off your belt", and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah, I -- I wouldn't have a problem with that at all.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're doing it for your own safety.  It's not that they're doing it just to make you angry. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exact- -- so, I guess -- so, what changed for me then I guess is I'm much more accepting of the security measures --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, that we have to go through for that stuff.
L:  Right. [SIGH] 
R:  Um --
L:  Where did you say you're from?
R:  Uh, Connecticut.
L:  Connecticut.
R:  West Hartford, Connecticut, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] So, did you --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- know anyone in New York? [SIGH]
R:  Yes, uh --
L:  Yeah?
R:  I actually have spoken with a friend of mine who was in a building watching all this happen --
L:  Oh.
R:  And, uh, they were let out early but he was there enough to watch the people who were ki- -- and he explained it to me and it was -- yeah, it was, uh, pretty scary as to what was going on and the people that are, you know, above floors that couldn't get down and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Kind of getting out, if you will.
L:  Right.  Not good.
R:  No.  So, well I mean I guess I listen a little bit more to the news now in terms of what's going on and different threats.  Um, but haven't really stayed away from the cities or anything like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh --
L:  Yeah, I can't say that I've really -- I don't guess that I've really changed anything.  I'm just more, um, more aware of different things than --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- before but I can't say I've changed in any way.
R:  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Who knows?
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just -- I just hope it doesn't happen again, you know, or   New York or any place else.  I mean, that's just -- it's awful, an awful tragedy.
R:  Right.
L:  And to see, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know if it was Newsweek or Time Magazine; it had pictures of all the widows that were pregnant at the time and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- have lost their husbands.  You know, and it showed all the widows and the babies now, you know, and --
R:  Oh, was it a lot?  It was a lot?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  There was quite a few.
R:  Oh.
L:  That's like that's such a shame.  These babies now have no father.  You know, they'll never know their dad. [SIGH]
R:  Is there so- -- are they doing something about that? [inaudible]
L:  Um, I really didn't -- I didn't read it all.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  [LIPSMACK] They just had a picture and, you know, I read some of the names and that but I -- I don't know. [SIGH]
R:  Hm.  What about, um, aren't they talking about new threats with, uh, the different viruses and all that?  Did anything come up with that having to do with SARS or not at all?
L:  Mm, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's some biological warfare or something like that.
L:  Mhm.  Not sure.
R:  Me neither.  Do I have a --
L:  So, how old are you?
R:  I am twenty seven.
L:  Twenty seven, okay.  
R:  How are you?
L:  Seeing if we were on the same age -- age wave, or not. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm thirty nine.
R:  Oh, okay.  Family?
L:  Um, yes.  I'm married with two daughters.  I have a sixteen -- fifteen year old and a twelve year old. [SIGH]
R:  Wow, excellent.  I have, uh --
L:  Yeah.  Are you married?
R:  Yes, I have a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- two year old and a five month old.
L:  Oh, wow, baby.
R:  Yeah, he sure is.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No, we're -- we're past all that stage.  Now we're -- now we're heading into driving.
R:  Driving and probably boys, right?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Not -- not yet.  She's not --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- allowed to date until sixteen but yeah, that'll be coming up.
R:  So, has -- has any of that stuff that happened kind of affected your relationship or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- thoughts towards your kids at all or ?
L:  No, I mean, it's something that at least my older one she, uh, I don't know.  She -- she seemed to act a little bit differently but the twelve year old really wasn't, you know, didn't show much affect at all.
R:  Were -- were they like kind of watching what was going on?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like did they get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They got what happened.  It was just sort of like too far removed maybe?
L:  Yeah, yeah, they -- and just not, I guess, can't comprehend that someone would actually do something like that.
R:  Yeah, seriously.  It's just sort of like a different -- I -- I don't even have that mindset.  Like that's -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  That's not even a possibility for me to ever even --
L:  No, exactly.  Y- I mean, I can't -- I can't even hard -- hurt an animal, you know, much less --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to kill myself along with these thousands of other people.  Yeah, but I think tha- -- I think that affected my older one.  You know, thinking, "How could somebody do that?"  You know?
R:  Or even like think to do that, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, to plan it all.
R:  It's[?] a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which I'm a -- yeah, supposedly was like this crazy planning that we- -- for a while.
L:  Right.  Right, it wasn't just something they decided yesterday and -- and did it.  They had been scheming. [SIGH] 
R:  I guess I was ki- -- I mean, it was go -- being in the airports a little bit more after -- I was kind of impressed a little bit [LAUGH] to see just how, you know, how they kind of stepped up the security and the new measures.  Although I've -- I have flown, uh, like to Israel using the EL AL --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And their security is just so much [LAUGH] so -- I mean, I -- I was hoping that something would get a little bit more like that but it's so far removed.  I mean, they're so far -- and obviously they don't really have any attacks ever.  Their -- their security is just in a class by themselves.  I was hoping they kinda would move towards that but I guess seeing all the people like freaking out over the fact they have to wait an extra five minutes to make sure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I guess our society wouldn't really handle that.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't -- I haven't flown since nine eleven.  Like I said we haven't flown but maybe three times total, so --
R:  Oh, okay, gotcha.
L:  So, I -- I haven't -- I haven't experienced that yet but like you said I wouldn't mind the wait at all, you know, to make sure that there's nobody bringing a bomb on or -- or guns or whatever.
R:  There's -- what do you -- what do you guys do for a living?
L:  Um, I stay at home and --
R:  Oh, excellent.
L:  I worked up until my -- my oldest one was born.  I worked up until the day before --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, since then my husband, um, he's wor- -- he's with the electrical company, Ammer and U.E.[?] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I'm able to stay at home.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  Stay at home --
R:  Was --
L:  -- and do the girl thing.  How about you?
R:  Excellent.  I'd -- I worked in, um, I'm an M.S. Director.  I work in computers.
L:  Ah.
R:  And my wife actually is -- is staying at home with the boys now.
L:  Uh-huh.  That's good.  I think as long as the wife's able to do that I think it's better for the kids main-, you know, mainly.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I'd rather have her bringing them up than some person I don't know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Ha- -- was, uh -- did nine eleven affect your husband's job at all in any way?
L:  No, it -- no that didn't change anything there.  No, everything went along the same. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  I guess if you're not really there so tied in it's sort of like -- in a scary way it's just sort of like something that happened to someone, you know, although it was like in New York versus in some far away country --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, everybody's aware but I would say a lot -- probably the majority of people's lives I -- I wouldn't feel that it had changed.  You know --
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  -- unless you were there and -- and had family and that.
R:  There was one girl that my wife knows that was working around there or something and we weren't able to get in touch with her for a couple of days so my wife was a little freaked out but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess she wasn't really near there a- after all when we finally figured it out.
L:  Mhm. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Hm.
L:  [MN]
R:  What are -- what are they supposed to do with that thing now?
L:  I don't know.  I have no idea.
R:  Hm.  I saw like some art- artistic sketches of some sort of field with grass and whatnot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I know they were -- they were talking about rebuilding, weren't they of ?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think saw like a whole bunch of, uh, firms threw in drawings of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- different things they thought could go there.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I think I'd seen that too but I never heard what they were going to actually do.
R:  Yeah, they kinda --
L:  Is it -- is it all cleaned up now?  Is it all ?
R:  I have not been there and I really haven't seen pictures other than what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- happened at -- during that time.
L:  Right.  I haven't either.  I don't know if it's all done [SIGH] or not. [SIGH] 
R:  I've been to New York since then but I guess I've never been quite around where that happened.
L:  Mhm.  I've never been to New York.
R:  You say you're from Missouri?
