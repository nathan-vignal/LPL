R:  Hello. [NOISE] 
L:  Hi. [NOISE] My name's Louise.
R:  Hi, Louise.  I'm Britney. [NOISE] [MN]
L:  And I'm from North Dakota.
R:  Oh gosh.  Okay, I'm in Florida. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  Away cross the world over here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And we are supposed to talk about the high salaries of, ah, professional players -- 
R:  [NOISE] I wish I knew more about, um, sports. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I do know that if, ah, you know they -- they want several million dollars a year --
R:  [SIGH]
L:   -- some of these players.
R:  Right.  Um, and going on strike, I think, is ridiculous when you're already getting paid --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- uh, so much and you demand more because that job -- to me sports is -- [MN] most sports is pretty much for everyone else's entertainment and, um, the thing with actors when they ask for more, I think that they're making enough. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, yeah, too much.  I -- nobody is worth that type of money. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, we work out here ours- -- I dunno what type of wages you get but you know ten dollars an hour looks pretty good around in the area where -- [LAUGH] where we are and a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of people work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for six and seven and eight --
R:  Ye- definitely.
L:  -- so  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, [SIGH] and --
R:  And it's hard for me to imagine because I do work hourly and it's hard to imagine making --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- a million.  Do you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's hard to imagine making a hundred thousand but -- let alone a few million which I would complain about?  I don't think so. [LAUGH]
L:  An- what would you really do with it?
R:  I dunno.
L:  Ah, [MN] uh-huh --
R:  I wouldn't know where to start.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- yeah -- it's just like they're -- they're not worth it.  Nobody is. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I agree with you, and it seems that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the salaries c- -- um, for professional athletes keep getting higher as well and I -- I guess -- I suppose that money comes from, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just the fact that it is entertainment and people are paying to watch it.  Is that correct?  Is that where the money comes from?
L:  Ah, well, probably --
R:  Advertising?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because all the advertising you know, uh, they pay thousands or perhaps tens of thousands for one ad --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- or maybe --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a quarter of a million even to put --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --these ads on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- between the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the commercials between all the -- 
R:  Right
L:  -- professional players.
R:  [NOISE] Isn't it, ah, the Super Bowl that -- um, the commercials that are shown --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- during the Super Bowl -- they have to pay millions to get a minute --
L:  Uh-huh, I --
R:  -- on air?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know the exact amount but it sounds --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like it's, uh, pretty accurate there.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] but no. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, ah, what uh they should do is just fire them all and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and go out and recruit and start from scratch.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [LAUGH] I agree.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But so many people love it though and so many, um, you know -- my dad, if there w- weren't sports on TV I don't know what he would do.  And you know, I mean so many people love it and respect it as a profession I -- I guess.  I mean, I don't know how to see it as a, [MN] you know, career, but so many people do that I guess it'll just keep going and people will pay to watch, pay to play, though -- you know, it --
L:  Ahah.
R:  [NOISE] -- I don't think sports are ever going to go away [LAUGH] --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- though  [SIGH] 
L:  No.  That -- you know, that [LAUGH] we're built with that need for recreation in us --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- but they've just gone overboard with their type of recreation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like and putting it into jobs and --
R:  Yeah.  I just don't think that it's, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [NOISE] that it's fair to ask for more when you're making so much.  It's one thing if you're, you know, spending your life travelling and playing sports --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so much physical activity for -- you know, if they're making m- minimum wage, that's one thing to complain about, but they're making a lot of money.  [LAUGH]
L:  And when they do go on strike, just think of the consequences that it's costing everybody else that is involved.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yup.
L:  They're -- they're losing too.  It's not just the players.
R:  Exactly.  It's not just about the players.  It's about [NOISE] everyone else.  [MN] Everyone involved in that industry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right.  
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I don't [SIGH] -- I don't know that I could see myself ever even being involved in any part of the athletic, um, market --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to do anything in it.  Y- you know?  It'd be hard to get myself to be involved with that because of people like players who are gonna go on strike because they want more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I just don't think that's fair. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] No.  
R:  Um --
L:  No, I -- I don't feel it's fair either, of them to do that.
R:  Right, and especially when you think about them compared to someone who's worked hard to get to where they are.  Worked their whole life for something and they've really had to struggle instead of just being paid to play. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, they work hard, but all of us work hard for our living. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yup, yup.
L:  So it's -- there's really a total imbalance.  It's like the rich get rich and the poor get poor. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Um, do you know anyone that plays any professional sports or have you known anyone? [NOISE] 
L:  Um. [SIGH] What -- mm, [MN] uh, almost.  Um -- I -- he's -- he retired like last year, year before. [NOISE] Uh, that lives nearby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] Ah hm.
R:  Even um -- I'm in college and even at the University of [NOISE] Florida, um, the football players that -- uh, the football team itself makes so much money because of ticket sales, because even students have to pay to go to the games, um, unlike a lot of other universities, but at ours we do and plus, um, alumni associations make so much money for the team and for the football program that, um, they've got a plane that they -- a private plane they'll use to go to any away games.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, [NOISE] I think --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- that it does, I guess, give them a pretty real sense of if they go professional --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- after college, what it will be like because they kind of introduce you to that um while you're in college.  Which I don't know if that's fair either compared to the rest of the school, um, the rest of the students that are just kind of watching it happen, but um   Even [SIGH] last year to a ball game, when they didn't use the plane, each player was given five hundred dollars just because that's what they would've used if they would've needed the plane and they didn't, so they just paid the players --  
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- which doesn't usually happen in college [LAUGH] sports.  You don't get paid for this.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But um, for some reason at my school it does with the football program and, uh, even that e- -- that's a lower level I know than professional sports but --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't think it's quite fair.
L:  Yeah, it depends on how and where they're raised.  Ah, that -- the gentleman -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that ah uh I know is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, his name is Phil Hanson.  He plays football.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And uh, he lives like oh [LAUGH] -- grew up on a farm about five miles from ourselves[?] farm over here. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, [SIGH] and he is just not that kind of person.  That's why I think he wanted to retire early and -- and just get out of [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- a lot of that too. [SIGH] 
R:  Right.  There are some definite, um, you know goodhearted --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- players though in every sport that you'll see doing huge --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fundraising things for charity and you know really working for other things than themselves.  Um, which I think is good and [PAUSE] I mean 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] They do -- a lot of players are role models to kids, to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- young boys a lot of times you know.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  They're, they're --
L:  Except for their moral life style.  To me that's not a role model.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I know but, it's good to see sometimes though that even the ones who are -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could've been caught up in the life style, do good things for people --
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh yeah.
R:  -- though, that-- and they do, um 
L:  Yep.  Their charities are -- you know, they -- they do have [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do some good there with their charities and they go round to the hospitals and do things, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in that area too.
R:  Yeah.  But I think that's good though because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, it probably --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is pretty easy to --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get caught up in a negative life style when you're living with so much money and so much just play [LAUGH]--
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- y- know, just all the time.
L:  Yeah.  But i- it, you know, [LAUGH] we've pretty well established that they're not worth -- worth that much money, you know. [NOISE] [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  They could just distribute it where it's needed. [SIGH] 
R:  Right. 
L:  [SIGH] Ah. 
R:  [NOISE] Well, what else?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  We've still probably got --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a minute or two left here. [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Some of these topics are kinda hard [LAUGH] sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- and I don't have that much [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- background on a lot of these sports, but I do know the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- basketball and football especially. [NOISE] I -- I guess professional golf t- -- you know.  But to me that's more of a -- a personal of trying to do your -- your best there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with your personal -- you know it doesn't [NOISE] -- isn't affecting the whole team with golf, so 
R:  Right.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've um, noticed things like [MN] sports that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are m- -- coming out um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just mo- -- in the last few years, that are growing like, um, water sports, like wake boarding or snow boarding or [SIGH] different extreme sports I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are becoming more popular.  I don't think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] starting out like -- ah, in the last few years that the people doing them have made very much and it seems like they're more true to just a sense of having fun and a sense of accomplishment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're not -- they don't seem to be in it for the money and I guess once anything gets as big as, I mean, your football --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --baseball --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --basketball does, then it's gonna start [NOISE] being more about the money but I think there are some professional sports though that the people definitely just --
