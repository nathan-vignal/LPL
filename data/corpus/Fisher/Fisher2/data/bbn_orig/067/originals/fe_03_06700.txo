L:  Hey, this is Kat.
R:  H- hi.  
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you work out a lot?
R:  Ah, [SIGH] not right at the moment.  Um, I'm on medical leave. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, possibly[?] not, yeah, probably a good idea, get yourself right. 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, do you?
L:  Well, I don't own a car, so I get a fair amount of walking every day to work, about a mile each way.
R:  Oh, my goodness, yeah, so --
L:  Walk [inaudible] to get my gro- --
R:  -- it would. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm renovating the house, so I get to put up a lot of dry wall and paint and primer and caulk and sand the walls, so don't really feel like I need an aerobic program at this point. [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I think that's -- that's quite enough. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and I just moved into my house, so that was plenty of lifting right there. 
R:  Oh, that's for sure. 
L:  Um, I think --
R:  No, w- --
L:  -- otherwise I try to do just a little bit for energy.
R:  Right. 
L:  Like, whenever you're at a time when you're not getting just normal exercise, sit in the office all day and go home and sit some more and pretty soon you don't have any energy at all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's for sure.  No, um, usually, um, well, I garden, so that -- that helps.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, I'm uncomfortable in gyms, so ... they're just kind of ugh, I don't like being around that many people.
R:  I know, because, well, I think they're always looking or they're judging, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what you're doing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, in -- in the one by me is a -- a notoriously catty gym, it's mainly a gay gym --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when you come in they're commenting on your outfit to your face, they're talking about your hair, it's like, "I'm here to work out, I don't wanna look good.  It's for looking good later".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I know, or -- or they're trying to see, you know, how well you're doing or, you know, i- it kinda makes you feel bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, the funny things is -- is, um, from my house, our windows look into the gym across the street and, ah, it's really depressing. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I can imagine.
L:  Like, five thirty in the morning there are people standing in the window just running in place for an hour.
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  Just a statement of futility.  You know, just staring at their reflection, running and running and running for an hour.
R:  Oh, my --
L:  It's really --
R:  -- gosh.
L:  -- insane[?].  [LAUGH] I always feel really good to just turn on the snooze and go back to that.
R:  [LAUGH] That sounds good. [LAUGH]  No, there's times I have been out, like, at, ah, parks on some of their walking trails --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and such, I've done that whenever I could. 
L:  Yeah, I like to do that.  I like to do swimming, anytime I can get to a pool or ocean or a river or [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- body of water.  I just don't like organized activity, I think, where the -- the specific point of doing it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is to be working out.  If it's play that's good, or if it's work that's good, but not just for its own sake, I guess. 
R:  No, that --
L:  In terms of, you know, I want to be this body size or, you know, stuff like that just doesn't motivate me. 
R:  Do you use, like, an exercise bike or anything?  Do you have anything like that at home?
L:  No, I used to have one that, ah, I used 'cause I'm kind of hyperactive, so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was good to have in the house, because I could do that and watch T.V. and read a book and, you know, keep thirty activities [LAUGH] going at once. 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  But I broke it 'cause I used it so much. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I've got one of those at -- at the house, that's why I was asking. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but, um, I don't know.  I think my boyfriend has a weight bench that I never used.  The weights are all too heavy and just kind of --
R:  We have one [LAUGH] --
L:  -- a pain to muck round with it.
R:  -- and it -- it gathered dust. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's just a pain to have to take off all of his weights and put on the lighter weights and then, yeah, I just never get around to it. 
R:  Well, usually --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- after I would, y- you know, you use it, then you get so sore if you haven't used it for awhile and it's, like, it almost --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, why -- why do it if it hurts this bad? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I mean, I've done a lot of athletic training, like weight lifting and marathon running and I did a marathon last fall.
R:  Oh, that --
L:  That was my first --
R:  -- sounds great.
L:  -- professionally organized marathon.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, I was pretty surprised just in terms of fitness level, I don't know, where it took you -- or what it took to prepare for it, but at the same time, when I was done with it, I didn't care if I ever ran another step again.  Like, there better be a --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- mugger behind me because [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] it was just grueling. 
R:  Well, how long did you have to prepare for it?
L:  Um, I started -- it was in the end of -- gosh -- mid October I guess.  And I'd started training for it in March of last year.
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] And that was after a year of not having done any running at all.
R:  And how long --
L:  And I did it mainly just to beat somebody else. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] How long was the --
L:  He said, "Oh, you could never run".  I was like, "Oh, really?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "Okay.  I'll --"
R:  How long was the mara- --
L:  "-- do a better time than yours".
R:  [COUGH] How long was the marathon?
L:  It's, gosh, twenty six miles.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was thinking, like, three or [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, no, no, no. 
R:  Oh, my --
L:  -- [several inaudible words]
R:  -- gosh. 
L:  Ah, it was crazy.  But it was good.  S- some point, you know, you're just running so slow, trying to get up the hill, that you're thinking, "I could walk this faster". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  And trying to run up hill, but, ah --
R:  Oh, my gosh. 
L:  Mm, it was okay.
R:  Well, did they have --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- people, like, you know, giving you water and stuff along the way and --
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely. 
R:  Oh, good. 
L:  It -- it was just surprising.  All fitness levels were represented.  Like, you saw people who were just -- you would look at them and think completely unfit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, they don't look like there's any muscle or tone or, you know, and then they would just get out there and chug like an engine, yeah.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Pretty cool.
R:  That is something.  I can't imagine twenty -- that many miles. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just -- for a goal, you know, it's worth it.  I'm just bad about the day to day, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] do aerobic or, you know, something specific to tone or shape your body --
R:  Right. 
L:  -- doesn't motivate me, I guess.  It has to be for a reason.  And then I don't mind doing it.  Unpacking the house, sure, unloading the truck, okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  When we were moving in, painting, sure, but it just feels so futile.  Although a friend dragged me to a couple of yoga classes.  Have you ever done yoga?
R:  No, I've always wanted to try 'cause it looks like it would be kinda fun. 
L:  Yeah, it's really good for your body because there's no soreness.  Like, the whole point is working on your flexibility and strength and it does strengthen your muscles.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  I just don't do very well with [COUGH] having instructors. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right, I can -- I've tried that even with, like, the videos.
L:  Yeah, I -- it's the tone of voice, you know, "And now we're going to do this". 
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] it just, ugh, sets my teeth on edge.  Like, "I'm not a child, come on". 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Talking to me in that fake sugary voice and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I just get annoyed quickly. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not that I'm an evil person.  I just have, you know, some sense of dignity [LAUGH] I think.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, some of the positions to -- that they want you to get into, you know --
L:  Yeah, also --
R:  -- and the names that they got 'em -- for 'em --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, and it's like, "Well, how do you figure that that's supposed to be what that looks like?" [LAUGH] 
L:  I know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I know.  And if you're doing them in front of other people, especially in the beginning stages --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's really embarrassing, you know, you're sticking your butt in someone's face --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- 'cause you're all lined up so tight in a row. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah. 
R:  I know, I [inaudible] -- I, ah, I had -- had you tried, like, Richard Simmons?
L:  No. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, again I think his voice would drive me crazy.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Any time I've tried to do a workout video I end up just turning off the sound and playing music. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] There for --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  I've got one of his vid- -- ah, it was fun up to a point, but after a while it was like, "No, I'd rather just sit and watch [LAUGH] him do it". 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But that's the problem with videos, is you get used to the rote, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- of their voice and, you know, what was supposed to be a pep talk pretty soon becomes pap. [LAUGH] And, ah --
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  -- just want him to shut up and move.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- at times it was more -- it re- really was more fun to watch than [LAUGH] do it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  Someone -- I -- my family used to buy me a lot of workout tapes because I was really fit and, you know, [SIGH] really active and running and track and stuff, so they wanted to help keep me fit over the winter and, you know, everyone was chipping in, getting me tapes, and I tried, you know, to get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] --
R:  Why sure.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] and my goodness, they -- they got me some kind of cosmo work out video.
R:  Right.
L:  It was just hilarious.  Like, creepy shaped women in unitards, you know. 
R:  Right.
L:  Push and pull and grapevine and grapevine, and doing these crazy outdated dance moves that I see no physical benefit --
R:  Exactly. 
L:  You know what I mean?  Like, how is this possibly -- other than I'm just moving --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and burning more calories than sitting, but this is not flexing or strengthening anything or working any specific --
