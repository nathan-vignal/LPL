L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Yeah, this is Bob.
L:  Hi, Bob, this is Shawna, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?  Could you talk a little louder, please?
L:  Sure.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Okay, let me turn my phone up. 
R:  Okay.
L:  Is that better?
R:  Thank you, I can hear you better.
L:  Okay.  [MN]
R:  Yes.  Well, what do you think about this topic?
L:  Well, I don't really have a problem with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the amount of money that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, athletes are paid, such --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, when you compare their salary to the salaries --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the franchise owners, it's very minimal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, I don't have a problem with that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they work hard for it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and uh, really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's society dictates --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll make by paying --
R:  Yeah, I -- I just -- I'm losing you.
L:  I'm s- -- you're losing me?
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  Okay --
R:  -- not too loud.
L:  -- I said, um, "I really don't have a problem with what they --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  " -- they are paid, I think they deserve it because they're --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- the owners of the teams are --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  " -- are making, um, a lot more than they are, and they're not doing --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- as much of the physical work", so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't really have a problem with that at all.
R:  What about the strikes?
L:  [MN] The --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think the strikes are necessary, I think they should get a bit, uh, larger pieces of the pie --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- because [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- without the players those owners would not have --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  --the type of luxuries --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that they are afforded off of the players' backs.
R:  I see.  You follow sports teams?
L:  Yes, I do --
R:  [SIGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- um, not any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one in particular right now.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I like basketball --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, football --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um, I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm kind of disenchanted with basketball right now just because I was a Michael Jordan fan [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and I -- I felt that he should have retired and stayed retired, uh, the first time.  I like to see people leave on top, so [MN] I- I'm really just searching --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for another team to follow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I do -- I really like, uh --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- San Antonio [LIPSMACK] because I like Tim Duncan, I -- I remember him at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Wake Forest --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I thought he was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a brilliant player.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] [MN] [SIGH] Uh, you f- -- what other teams you follow, any of the other teams -- baseball?
L:  [MN] No, I never watch baseball actually.
R:  Uh, I see.
L:  I -- I like it in person, but I -- I find it a bit boring to watch --
R:  Boring [MN].
L:  -- on television [LAUGH] but I like playing and I like, uh, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- live games, but, uh --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's it.  What about yourself, how do you feel about the topic?
R:  Y- -- I -- I think they get paid too much.
L:  Too much?
R:  Too much, yeah, there's so much poverty in United States right now [SIGH] and so much problems that I don't think they should be paid all that much.
L:  But, don't you think society dictates how much they're paid?  Because, if people are willing --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's al- -- yeah, that's true.
L:  Yeah, it's so -- it's not really their fault that there's a supply and demand --
R:  Yeah, well I think --
L:  -- for it.
R:  -- that if people just did not go to the games they would lower those tickets from fifty dollars to two dollars, if they had to.
L:  Right.  Now, but that's up to us --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but that still doesn't, um -- i- it still doesn't, um, address the issue that they have, and their issue is that compared to how much they make for the owners and what they are paid, it is very disparate and that is not fair.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well I- I agree with you there, yeah.
L:  You see what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, when the topic is just, you know, what they should be paid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think they should be paid a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a more fair portion --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- proceeds, because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it is them that dra- -- it's, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the players that draw the crowd --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- it's not the business owners.
R:  Yeah, I don't believe that they should be paid ho- -- what they get paid at all. I- i- it's too much money.  There's too many s- -- er, er, sick people, poor people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in this country that [SIGH] can use some money and they pay that and who goes to these games?  Only rich people go to games.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  So, that a problem for me. [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's -- that's true --
R:  [NOISE] We can't afford to go to no game. [NOISE]
L:  -- that's true, it's very expensive to go to games.  Do you like sports, at all?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I do, but I don't go to games.
L:  Because of the high prices?
R:  Yes, yeah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if I get a ticket some time, [MN] I go, but not -- not -- not [NOISE] normally, no. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah, I find it's not such a good i- -- such a good -- a good way to spend a hundred dollars. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Got other things to do.
L:  Right.
R:  Wh- where you live at?
L:  [SIGH] I live in Atlanta.
R:  Atlanta.
L:  Uh-huh.  Where do you live?
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, I'm going to visit Philadelphia soon.
R:  Are you?  Oh okay.
L:  I -- I have a friend that lives there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you like Philadelphia?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I've been here forever.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I've been here ... So, uh, in Atlanta, do you have a -- are you a Bra- -- you don't go to Braves games?
L:  [SIGH] No, I -- I don't and our, uh -- our basketball team is not so good, so I don't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] I don't really go to their games either --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] but they're almost giving tickets away, um, for the, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the basketball because they're not that great so people --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- aren't coming to the games, so they had to lower --
R:  They're not --
L:  -- the prices.
R: --  coming to the game?
L:  [SIGH] Right, they had to lower the prices --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- down --
R:  [NOISE] So, h- how --
L:  -- it's really about supply --
R:  -- how many --
L:  -- and demand.
R:  -- yeah, you have a -- you have a stadium of the sort of, uh, er, minor leagues there?
L:  For the minor leagues?  I'm not so sure.
R:  Okay.
L:  I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you all have one?
R:  Yeah, we have -- we have it for the [SIGH] -- for the, uh, Camden, i- -- ac- across the road from Pennsylvania -- Philadelphia, they have River Sharks which are the [NOISE] minor league team.
L:  Oh.
R:  And [MN] those games all -- all very well priced, they're like six, seven dollars.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know that we have that.
R:  Yeah, that's for baseball.
L:  Oh --
R:  They're minor leagues.
L:  I should look into that.  Okay.
R:  Like, they got one in --
L:  But there's a lot of good players in the minor leagues too, I'm sure.
R:  Yeah, so they -- we go there some time, but we can't afford the other thing. [SIGH] Like, they're building a big stadium in Philadelphia and it's costing -- costing tax payers money now, [MN] not only the teams, the tax payer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Now, that's not fair.
L:  [NOISE] But didn't people vote for that?
R:  [SIGH] Well, got yourself through.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it give people some -- some -- some, uh --
L:  Incentive.
R:  -- employment, but not that much.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, and it's very crowded to get there and it's just not going to work good.
L:  [SIGH] What, are they outsourcing the employment from other cities, or are they trying to keep people employed there?
R:  Well, it's eventers and things like that --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- than people who want food [SIGH] and security and stuff like that.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, so th- they get --
L:  Oh, so that's not so bad.
R:  -- some jobs out of it, but not too many jobs [MN] for what they charge to go in there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- twenty dollars to park a car, that's too much --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that's too much.
L:  That is a lot.  Now, you all just had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] uh, what is the, uh -- th- the basketball team --
R:  Oh, Lloyd Brown?
L:  -- the, um --
R:  Coops[?]?
L:  -- forty nine -- f- -- uh, what are they?  No.
R:  Seventy sixers?
L:  Seventy sixers, I knew there was a number -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in there somewhere. 
R:  Sixers.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, the sixers now, it -- a lot of people showed up to that game when I watched it on television, it was sold out, now what stadium was that in?
R:  That's in --
L:  For the play offs.
R:  -- in Philadelphia.  That's at -- [SIGH] that's at the First U- --
L:  What --
R:  -- First Union Center.
L:  Oh, First Union Center, that looked really nice.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's brand new.
L:  Oh.
R:  But the tickets were, like, eighty dollars, hundred fifty dollars.
L:  Really?
R:  So, that's a little bit out of range for some of us.
L:  Yeah.  One of my friends went to the game, he enjoyed it, but I know he bought his tickets a long time ago, he just had faith in the team, that they would go all the way --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so when he bought them, they were not that expensive.
R:  [SIGH] I don't have faith in this team at all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- after what they lost --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you -- y- y- y- you follow basketball?
L:  [SIGH] Yes, I watched the play offs.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I watched them, but they, [SIGH] I mean, I think they gave it a good run.
R:  Mm, I don't know, I think they -- they put that too much -- too much pressure on that Iverson.
L:  Oh, they do, I mean, without his performance they don't have a team.
R:  Yeah, and he's small.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  He not too tall, he's small.
L:  He is small, but it's, uh -- he's a great player, but you can't carry the whole team --
R:  Nah.
L:  -- by yourself.
R:  Nah.
L:  And I think that's was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- starting to happen.
R:  [SIGH] So, and how many times have you called up this number?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, three times.
R:  Oh, how many times you get to call?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  You get ten dollars each call?
L:  Yeah, well this is -- today is the first time I have --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, uh, I got some calls last week, but I wasn't able to answer them when they came through, unfortunately --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- how long have you been?
R:  This my last time I have -- I have to be on the phone.  Sometimes when you call there's nobody to talk to because they have to have people that are going to talk --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- so sometimes I called on a day and there ain't nobody around.
L:  And you re- receive ten dollars?
R:  No, if there's nobody around you ain't connected, you ain't going to get the money.
L:  No, I mean, once you've been connected?
R:  Uh, yeah, but --
L:  How long does it usually --
R:  -- they're supposed to send me a check for -- for thirty dollars.
L:  Huh?
R:  They're supposed to send me a check for -- [NOISE] for thirty dollars. [NOISE]
L:  And usually they come, uh, in a timely fashion?
R:  I don't know, I never did this before, this first time.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, this is your first time as well?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, so, I guess, er -- I guess we gotta [SIGH] -- gotta talk a little bit more about these sp- sports teams [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now, do you, uh -- do you dig the golfing? [MN]
L:  No, I don't really follow golfing --
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  -- um, that's -- that's -- I r- -- I want to get into it, because it's a real thinker's sport and it seems like something I would like, but, uh -- yeah, w- -- I just -- I just don't have a problem with what they're paid, because I -- I feel that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they deserve it -- if they're --
