L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Hello. [SIGH] 
L:  Hello.
R:  [SIGH] Hello, this is Ellen Burr speaking, [SIGH] and our topic of the day --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is the changes wrought [SIGH] by September eleventh.
L:  My name's Bonita Payne, and I'm from Georgia.
R:  Well, I'm from California.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm from Georgia.
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Pardon me?
L:  [NOISE] I'm from Georgia. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, right. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, we're from two totally different parts of the world.
R:  [SIGH] That -- that's true, that's true. [SIGH] although, they call, uh, this part of California the south land, so perhaps we have that in common. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  And, uh, [MN] so to answer the, uh -- the question that was asked, uh, have you had any major changes in your life since Sep- because of September eleventh?
L:  [NOISE] Well, I was pregnant on [NOISE] September eleventh, so I've -- you know, thought about things.  I have a little one now, so I -- you know, I look at things a lot -- you know, a lot of things, you know, a lot different, 'cause I have her and, [SIGH] you know, want to make her have the best life I can and, you know, watch out for all the stuff that's going on right now. 
R:  [SIGH] That's a tremendous --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I had a change on the other side of the coin because [SIGH] my husband was terminally --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ill at that time, [SIGH] and, uh, [LIPSMACK] so he died in -- in November, [SIGH] so --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that came, you know, fairly soon after the September eleventh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But I -- I think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for both of us having --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- these tremendous --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- changes in our -- our life, you know, this great wheel of -- of life --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, [SIGH] well, my, uh --
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] makes it very different.
L:  -- my aunt and uncle had a daughter born on September eleventh.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] really?
L:  [NOISE] Their daughter was born that day.
R:  Oh.
L:  She was born in the afternoon after -- after it. [MN] 
R:  Oh, I see, yes, well.
L:  After the, um -- all the [NOISE] --
R:  Well, she'll --
L:  -- all the crashes --
R:  -- [MN] she'll always --
L:  -- and stuff. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right. [SIGH] Uh, she'll --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- always remember her birthday, [LIPSMACK] that's sure.
L:  Yeah, so, I remember it, I remember it too. [NOISE] 
R:  Yes, I have a new grandson now, so as I say, the wheel of life, you know, keeps --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] keeps moving and turning, [SIGH] and --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, so, I think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- for -- probably for both of us --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- b- because of these --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- vast changes, you know, vital changes --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] uh, we didn't have typical experiences --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] that other people may have had September eleventh --
L:  No.
R:  [SIGH] by any means. [SIGH] And, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I -- I was really glad that my husband didn't have to see any more of the horrors that hap- that occurred --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] because he was in the second world war, and, uh -- [SIGH] and then he knew that, you know, all war is hell and that --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- there were going to be repercussions, [LIPSMACK] and that --
L:  Yeah, my brother in law, [NOISE] they were overseas now [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, I hear your baby. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [SIGH] Do you have a boy --
L:  She's --
R:  -- or a girl? [SIGH] 
L:  She -- she's a girl, she's fourteen months old.
R:  Oh, yeah, my -- my grandson is six months old --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- so I -- [SIGH] I go over and help my daughter every day so [NOISE] that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a -- that's a great things [NOISE] to -- [SIGH] to get back to [LIPSMACK] the future [SIGH] and, uh -- which I think we all want to get.  The -- well, what do you feel about, uh, [SIGH] what has happened since September eleventh and, uh, [SIGH] uh, the direction tha the country is -- is now in? [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Has that made a difference to you?
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] It hasn't -- it hasn't really m- it has but it hasn't, I guess you would say.
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Well, I -- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- find that I'm very, uh, depressed by the news now [SIGH] and there was --
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't even -- I don't even watch it.
R:  I know I --
L:  I don't want to know. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I'm the same way exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, [SIGH] if I hear about it, I hear about it at work, everybody'll -- you know, eventually everybody'll say something about it. We -- [NOISE] [SIGH] we don't ever even watch the news hear.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I can understand.
L:  Yeah, at home we don't watch the news.  We -- you know, if I hear something I either hear it on a radio or family talks about it because, you know, it's just --
R:  It's too depressing, [LAUGH] really.
L:  Well, it -- it's not --
R:  In some ways.
L:  -- something that, you know -- [SIGH] and -- and another thing is because having, you know, a little one, they say that it's not good to watch the news and stuff with 'em.
R:  [SIGH] That's true, my daughter --
L:  It can cause them to have nightmares, [SIGH] but she loves it.  If my grandmother has it on, she sits there and watches it, like, she knows exactly what they're saying.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] And I won't watch it at my house, I -- you know, she watches it there, like, when she gets there in the morning time.  She used to, she doesn't stay there anymore, but [NOISE] -- but it did watch her and she would [NOISE] sit there in the morning [NOISE] and the news was on [NOISE] and so she [NOISE] was, like, watching George Bush. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  "What's going on today?" [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] Well, for her it was just, you know --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- people and sights and sounds and, uh, I'm sure --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but -- but I can understand, my -- my daughter --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- won't, uh, watch the news when [LIPSMACK] -- when --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- her son is there, you know, she doesn't want him to get used to watching [SIGH] that much television for one thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But I was glued, you know, to the news, as everybody was, on September eleventh when --
L:  Oh, yeah, we were --
R:  -- when [inaudible].
L:  -- all work.  We were all standing there watching it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, and you see it over and over and over and over again.
L:  Like, "Oh, my gosh, what just happened?" [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, it, uh, it -- it was tremendous shock, but, uh [SIGH] --
L:  And then people trying to find out if their families were in there and --
R:  [SIGH] Yes, it -- it --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- was, it was a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- absolutely horrible and ghastly, you know, event, but --
L:  [SIGH] The -- the -- the best thing I heard was the one story about the teachers that were -- the teachers of that daycare that was in building number two before it got hit, and they heard about the rockets and th- they heard the rest of the first building, [SIGH] and they got all the kids out.
R:  [SIGH] Yes, I remember that.
L:  A Miss [inaudible] and got to the grocery store and put kids in the grocery carts and pushed them to a nearby school. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh, so they could sit there and wait for either their parents, if their parents hopefully got out, [SIGH] or for someone else to come and get them. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, my nephew, uh, was, w- uh, work- was just working in -- in at Merrill Lynch, and uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] and the office manager said, "Everybody go home right away" and so they --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- all got out before the -- y- you know, before anything really happened. [SIGH] I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I d- some people were all aware that this was -- you know, this isn't a -- there had been threats against the, uh, [SIGH] World Trade Center before, so some seasoned people knew to get out --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- right away. [SIGH] But if you were.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- [SIGH] the higher up you were --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the [LAUGH] more expensive the [LAUGH] -- the property the -- the, uh -- the worse it was for you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And it was, it was just terrible to -- to have to watch it, and -- [SIGH] and finally, uh, you know, we just had enough, [SIGH] and, uh -- and since my husband died and, uh [SIGH] -- and, you know, looking at the news, finally I've just given up, because I say I just can't -- you know, it's way too disturbing to see this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- all the time [SIGH] and I really hate seeing this war that came out of this --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in -- in Iraq --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and the terrible destruction of that country.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  It just seems to have -- you know, war doesn't --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- make things any --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- better.
L:  No.
R:  [SIGH] It's easy to make war, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's hard to make peace. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, so I -- I find it very difficult, but I do find that, uh, [LIPSMACK] you know, looking forward --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to raising a n- a new generation and -- and you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with your daughter and me --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with my grandson, [SIGH] uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it gives a different viewpoint of -- uh, toward life.  You don't want to dwell on the bad things, instead you want to look forward [SIGH] and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- hope that the world will be a better place for these children --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- these innocent children. [LAUGH] 
L:  I've got all these people that say, "If we make it to whatever" or, [SIGH] "When, you know --" there are all these people that when judgment day comes, and, uh, you know, a D day comes and, you know, all this crazy stuff.  When it comes it's going to come, you can't sit around and wait for it.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] No, you --
L:  And you got to live life the way you're going to live it and when it happens it happens, you know, that's just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like those people.
R:  I know.
L:  You know, the people -- they didn't know they were -- that was going to happen to 'em --
R:  No, I know.
L:  Their families didn't know that was going to happen.  If you sit around every day hoping, "Oh, my gosh, what if I don't ?"  You know.
R:  Well, you can't dwell on -- on the -- on the past certainly --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, uh, [SIGH] but I know just before -- before --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- my husband died, one of the last things he says w- said was, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "Poor old planet".  And, uh, [MN] he just, you know, thought that this was one of the worst [MN] things that was going to happen, that it was like, uh, [MN] you know, that there were other things happening to the environment and -- and so on, and, uh -- [SIGH] and he hated to see this country [SIGH] turning towards --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- war again --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- he was so [MN] anti war.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, but we didn't look at the news, uh, [MN] at that time. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It was [LAUGH] -- it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- finally it got too much for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- almost everybody I think.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And so I -- I find it really, uh -- I d- I [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it hasn't changed my life in, uh -- in any particular way.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I was much more affected by my husband's death --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- than I was by the death of so many --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really. [LIPSMACK] And I think --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  -- you were more affected by the life -- new life, than, uh -- than what has gone on in the past.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think that's a -- as it should be. [SIGH] But I [MN] really think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- that what's come out of it is I have a lot of anger now at [SIGH] the direction our country is going into [SIGH] of calling --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- another religion an evil religion --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- intruding upon people's liberties [LIPSMACK] and making war for --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- political gain [SIGH] and for big business.  The -- I hate to see the country going into [SIGH] -- into --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- this kind of tail spin [SIGH] and I hope --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we come out of it. [SIGH] So, because -- and then it will be a better world [LIPSMACK] and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I hope we do something about Medicare, [SIGH] uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to keep it going and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and to get good health care for our children --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that a good education -- I'm more a word --
L:  Now, me, um --
R:  Hello.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, sorry.
R:  [SIGH] I'm sorry.
L:  Are you still there?
R:  Yes, I'm still here.
L:  Okay, I heard you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] but, -- so, I -- I think in -- in some way --
