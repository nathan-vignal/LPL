L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  How -- I am Rita.  So where are you?
R:  Hi, Rita.  I'm Andy.
L:  Okay.  What state are you from?
R:  I am in Georgia, I'm in --
L:  O- --
R:  -- Atlanta.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, okay Rita.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's two different parts of the world we are. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, my -- I haven't really changed much.  I'm just a -- a little more vigilant, but as far as the day to day activities go the -- I can't say that I've made any major changes myself.
L:  No, I haven't either.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  We live i- in out state Minnesota, so we're, you know, quite a distance from any large metropolitan area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so that, you know --
R:  [NOISE] That helps. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  The only thing is I did --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fly to Boston last year, and they run me through the, ah, airport, and they run a wand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- over me, and I had a little scissors in my purse and they took that away from me. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know why I never thought about I had it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But the x-ray showed it up, you know, and --
R:  [NOISE] Well, I had a fork.  Oh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- by God, and I forgot.  I had went to work at lunch -- I had lunch one day and [NOISE] had a fork in my pocket and had to fly home for a funeral. [NOISE]  Well, it wasn't in my pocket, it was in my purse.  And you know how you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- switch purses and you just kind of forget.  You only take the necessities and it was a -- a fork in there and then they acted a- as if I -- I really had like a -- a nine millimeter gun --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in my purse.  [NOISE] It was hysterical, I mean I got searched, I got questioned.  And I'm serious about a fork.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] So -- [LAUGH]
L:  No, no they were real nice to me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They just laughed and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of laughed about it because --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess they figured an old grey haired lady wasn't going to [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE] No. [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but they did --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take it away from me, and they did run the wand over me.  And they made me take my shoes off and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE] Make sure nothing's in there, but -- yeah. 
L:  And then when I -- we came back -- my daughter collects quarters, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- the state quarters, and she buys them by the roll.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And she had like forty dollars.  "Oh, ma, you can take --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- those home".  And of course I had them in my purse [LAUGH] and they made me pull 'em out and I thought they were going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- make me open the roll, but they didn't.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I was going to say.
L:  They did [inaudible] --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my God. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Thought I had something in them, but they didn't.
R:  [NOISE] And I think --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- most people are -- are like us.  I mean, unless you're in New York City or -- or Philadelphia -- I mean or Pennsylvania, you may have a -- a little more hysteria about yourself, but I -- I don't know, you can't stop living, you know?
L:  Well, this is it.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm sure if you were, you know, in Washington DC to -- you know, you might think about things.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  But, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out here in the hinterlands ...  And I didn't buy any duct tape and I didn't buy any plastic. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] You know, I -- I didn't either.  I didn't either and I had a lot of family members that, um -- that did and I'm here in Atlanta alone and when- whenever that happened on September eleventh I can remember that they were saying on the broadcast that they were headed to Atlanta.  So, you know, the family's like, "Oh, you have that international airport there and [you know] you really should" and I was like, "I'm not buying into it" you know, I get all this stuff and then, you know, when it's over just like the Y two K thing, you know, what am I going to do with all this stuff? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, and then, you know, would it really save you?  You know, it -- it --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, you know, that's the point.  That's -- that's -- I re- -- I really believe that that's the point.  The duct tape and the plastic, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] -- come on. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  This is what I thought.  If it gets that bad --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- you wouldn't be here to worry about it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That was another way to think of it, but I just --
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I don't all the duct tape in the world would really help you. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] No, no, you're right.  If it was that close and -- and that -- you know, that close and that vital then, um, you know --
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] -- duct tape? [LAUGH]  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] Bottles of water, all that good stuff would just be. 
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  But, ah -- ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I think we covered that pretty good. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, we over -- I -- I really -- you know, I -- I -- I try not to -- to focus on -- on things I can't change, you know?
L:  Well, that's just the same with us, you know?
R:  [NOISE] You have to live --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- and you can't be, you know -- and they keep changing the -- the code.  Ah, it's orange and it's red and it's -- you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and -- and I -- I don't pay any attention to it.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.  It's --
L:  Ah --
R:  [NOISE] -- it's hysterical, especially after there was a leak that they knew about the terrorist and they knew about nine eleven and ignored it, and all of sudden they're over paying attention --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- to, um --  So --
L:  And, ah --
R:  [NOISE] So many conspiracy theories about -- about that day.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  H- how did you pick up this Fisher, ah, phone calls?
R:  [NOISE] Actually a friend of mine, um, told me about it and I called, and, um -- actually this is about the third time that they've called.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And I think three is the limit.
L:  Yeah, that -- I -- I mean, this is my third call also.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, is it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, a friend told me about it and I thought, "Oh, why not" and --
L:  Well I --
R:  [NOISE] -- I called and --
L:  -- found it on the internet, so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  That's how, ah --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she told me about it, yeah.
L:  I'm surprised it's as widespread I guess.
R:  [NOISE] It is, because a guy friend of hers told her about it because, ah, they sent me some paperwork similar to what she was telling me.  They want guy, they want male participants and they pay --
L:  Yeah, this is what --
R:  [NOISE] -- you extra.
L:  -- it came in on the internet too.  The -- you know, you would get extra if you could sign up ten men or something like that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause I guess they know they don't like to talk. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's it.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] They won't take the time and they don't --
L:  Yeah.  It --
R:  [NOISE] -- like to talk.
L:  -- it isn't worth money to them or -- [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah. 
L:  We'll do it for -- we'll do it for money.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but I've enjoyed -- I've enjoyed, ah, the last topic, ah, was about divorce and -- and morals and all, so, you know, I'm divorced so that was --
L:  Okay.  We --
R:  [NOISE] -- fitting. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I did one on, um, smoking.
R:  [NOISE] On smoking?
L:  Yeah, smoking.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  I bet that was interesting.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] That's becoming a little taboo. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, yes. [LAUGH]  And here in Minnesota, you know, in the winter time they gotta go outside and smoke.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Almost everywhere here too they -- they -- they took it out of all the public places in one county.  You know, they -- no place that is considered a -- you know, none of the bars, the restaurants.  I'm like, wow.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] You know, they're like really alienating smokers and they're raising the prices.  I don't see how they afford them anyway. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I don't either, you know.  And now here in -- in Minnesota we're going to budget crunch, like --
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  -- lots of places, and they're talking of put -- about putting an extra dollar a pack on.
R:  Whoa. [LAUGH]
L:  It hasn't gone through yet, but --
R:  [NOISE] That -- that probably won't stop 'em either.  I guess if --
L:  No, I'm sure it won't.
R:  [NOISE] It's an addiction that you can't shake.
L:  It's like everything else I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So, ah, um --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  But that nine eleven thing, I don't -- I don't know -- and I don't think, um -- I think it probably won't happen in that multitude again.  They probably will try to --
L:  Yes, I'm sure they'll have sporadic things.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  [NOISE] But I don't think it'll ever be that bad again.
L:  Mm.  Well, that was a surprise thing, you know?  And no-one was expecting anything like that.
R:  [NOISE] Mm.
L:  So --  Where were you when you heard it?
R:  [NOISE] Actually I was at work.  Um, I was working for MCI at the time and we got calls from -- from, um -- from that area of people just sobbing on the phone all at one time.  And then they were like, "Oh, have you guys heard?" and, you know, they were telling us about it.  And then we started chatting and they closed the center -- they closed the entire center down and, um, put a recording on and let everyone go home.  Because, you know, most people -- actually I have family in New York and I have a cousin who was right around the corner.  So, um, most of the people, once we  heard about it, we just couldn't function.
L:  Well, that's true too.
R:  [NOISE] So, I mean we --
L:  No.
R:  [NOISE] -- they closed the building down.  Actually the day after we were closed as well.  So, um -- yeah, I remember it in -- as a matter of fact I -- I had just, um, divorced so I had, ah -- I was, ah, moving into [LAUGH] my apartment.  It was the only day available.  I have no family here and the moving company was like, "We can do it today".  So I actually moved into my apartment [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] -- on that day.  Yeah, that's -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] -- that's the -- the biggest memory I have about that day, actually moving and then getting settled in and hearing about it, you know, like all day and all night, and --
L:  Yes, you have a television on all the time.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my God.  And whatever channel you were watching --
L:  It was on, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- it was on.  Continuous coverage.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  Um [PAUSE] -- now, we have to stay on for ten minutes so we gotta think of something else.
R:  [NOISE] Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was, ah, out on the road that day.  I -- I do some retail evaluations and I listen to a lot of cassette tapes so I wasn't even listening to the radio.  And I got to a -- a town and my, ah, nephew's wife was there and she had the kids with her.  And I said, "Why aren't you kids in school?"  She'd pulled them out of school.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And that's how I found out about it.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.  You know they said that they were gonna try to attack the schools.  They had the schools on alert, um, just recently.  'Cause I have a -- a six year old and a four year old, and, ah, the school had a --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- meeting about their evacuation plan and their plan, you know --
L:  Yeah, what to do with 'em if something happened.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.  And they didn't want to publicize or send out fliers home to the parents when they were going to have the meetings.  It was really crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I'm like, "Okay". [LAUGH]  But we finally -- a few of us -- handful of us found out and we just kind of told the others and showed up and had our little evacuation plan from them.
L:  Yeah.  What were they going to do, take 'em to an [inaudible] or something?
R:  [NOISE] Well, yeah, that's exactly what they --
