R:  Hi, my name is Susan.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Sarah.
R:  Hi Sarah, nice to meet you.
L:  [NOISE] Nice to meet you too.
R:  Well, I don't how we're going to [LAUGH] have much to talk about with this topic of the day.  Do you follow a lot of sports?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, just baseball and luckily that's the one they were talking about. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, are they supposed --
L:  [NOISE] Lucky for me.
R:  -- to go on strike?
L:  Um, I think it was the one that just recently passed --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- where they -- they almost, ah, did a strike but didn't [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- at the last minute.
R:  You know, it's really hard to feel sorry for people making millions and millions of dollars.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I can't feel sorry for them anyways. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think by in large a lot of athletes probably -- I shouldn't say this, um, my husband was in a golf tournament.  It was like a charity golf tournament and a lot of -- kind of like, um, second tier ex-professional athletes were there.  And they were the biggest bunch of -- pretty much jerks --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- in the world.  Um, you know, it's just like they've been kind of used to, like, being catered to all their life and people thinking they were, like, really cool and doing stuff for them all of their lives.  And I think when things just kind of don't [LAUGH] go their way, they get really mad.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]  Ah, we just have a, ah -- just a, ah -- I guess a single A baseball team here in this area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and well, I know that those guys aren't paid very well at all and --
R:  No they -- they're not.
L:  -- and well, I kind of -- [LAUGH] you kind of have to wonder how somebody who -- ah, they're all playing the same game --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and these guys are making maybe, what, fifteen, twenty thousand a year --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, for what they're playing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And these other guys are making millions of dollars playing the exact same game.
R:  Right.
L:  And they're no more valuable than these guys.
R:  Well y- yeah probably not. [LAUGH]
L:  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]  As far as, like, you know, personal value of a person.
R:  Yeah.  Where do you live that you have a single A team?
L:  Um, Hagerstown, Maryland.
R:  Well, um, I live in Dayton, Ohio.  We have a Dayton Dragons and I think they're single A.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]  Yeah, we have the Hagerstown Suns. [LAUGH]
R:  And you know, w- -- um, if you know who Marge Schott is, who was the owner, or used to be the owner of the Cincinnati Reds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She didn't want I -- ah, like a minor league baseball town in Dayton because she thought, "Well, people won't go to the Reds".  And I tell you, I haven't went to the Reds in like years, ever since the Dragons came to town, because it's so much more fun to go to a -- to go to the minor league teams.
L:  And it's a whole lot cheaper. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my golly, yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause we only live an hour from Baltimore, but I've probably been to three Orioles games in my life maybe. [LAUGH]
R:  I've probably been to, um, oh, maybe five Reds games, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You drive an hour plus you pay ten dollars to park.  You know, the tickets, I mean, they're kind of inconsequential compared to [LAUGH] what you spend once you get in there.
L:  The food. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, the food.  Five dollars a beer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- someone said.  And then, you know, you've been there all night and then you have to then spend like an hour and a half to two hours to come back.
L:  Yeah --
R:  And then --
L:  -- sitting in the parking lot for --
R:  Yeah.  Dr -- yeah --
L:  -- [LAUGH] forever.
R:  -- by the time you battle the traffic.  So, I mean, I just kind of enjoy the minor league stuff almost as much -- I mean, more so.  I don't know if like the Hagerstown team is set up this way, but there's always something going on.
L:  Oh, yeah.  There's always some promotions.
R:  A promotion, um, like we have, um -- well, apparently, um, our little, um, like the -- the -- the mascot is this dragon called Heater and this year apparently he got a girlfriend.  So, you know --
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, he's chasing her all over the baseball field.  I mean, you know, they do dances, they bring in people from all over that we -- that, you know, to sing the, ah, national anthem.  I mean, it's just like craziness going on all the time. [LAUGH]  I mean, for your entertainment value, really you can't -- it can't be beat.
L:  Yeah, and if you think about it, so these guys are being paid how little, and we enjoy the games more [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- than the ones who are paid --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- millions of dollars.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm sure their point is -- I mean, someone's making money off them so why shouldn't they?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think they probably -- some of 'em really have to, like, realize, like, I've never been to an NBA game but my sister and her boyfriend follow, like, the c- -- the Calves[?] and y- -- who ca- -- I mean, they're -- they're going to price themselves out of the market because people won't spend the money to go to the games.  They won't be able to.
L:  Yeah, they're expensive.  I -- I know that football tickets are just as bad because my son is a -- a huge Pittsburgh Steelers fan --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and my husband thought he might take him to a game and found out the tickets are like fifty dollars a piece.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you can't even be sure that your seats will be together. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  Yeah, they --
R:  So what would you do with a little boy? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]  A ten year old sitting by himself.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that would be great. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So I don't -- I mean, do you think that -- I mean, they have a point where, you know, the management or the owners of the team are making millions off of them so they should get their piece of the pie or TV rights or commercials or all that other stuff?
L:  Um, I can't imagine -- ah, I don't see why they should be paid so much as far as a salary goes.  I can understand with, um -- I guess what, you know -- what -- what Nike pays them or what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Reebok pays them.  I -- I can understand that and that's, you know, the -- the company's business I guess.  But, ah, I don't see why, ah, just, ah, being a baseball player you should make so much money.  That -- that's just ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It is kind of -- now what do you think about, like, selling your autographs and things like that?
L:  Oh, now that's crazy. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's insane. [LAUGH]  The -- the prices people will charge [LAUGH] and it's just because they signed a piece of paper --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- that just is insane.  There's no way.  You know, like for baseball cards. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, do your -- do your -- do your boys collect stuff like that --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- memorabilia?
L:  Oh, they -- they love it.  Um [LAUGH] I don't -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I don't know.  It -- it seems awfully expensive and seems like an expensive hobby, but, yeah -- but people pay hundreds of dollars for, you know, one little baseball card.
R:  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know or -- or autographs or -- or whatever.  And, you know [MN] -- you know, I can see, like, the -- the baseball players point is, you know, they give a -- they give a free autograph to a kid, but, um, and then the -- the kid turns around and sells it, but, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- you gotta -- you gotta give something away sometimes in your life or -- or, you know, you're one of these -- do you think they feel they owe anybody?  Because if everybody just stopped watching baseball or stopped going to games, what would they do?
L:  Yeah, ah, no some of them I -- I know do donate a lot of time or money to their communities.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is really nice.  'Cause I guess they wouldn't be able to donate if they didn't get the money in the first place. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But it -- it still doesn't seem like quite enough.  It -- it seems like we put too much value on -- on professional athletes and not enough value on people like, I don't know, daycare providers. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  So that [LAUGH] like our teachers, you know, people who are actually really important in life.  I'm sure we would all be fine if there were no professional sports on television.
R:  Yeah.  If there -- or if there was only half as much professional --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sports.  I'm sure we wouldn't probably notice at all.
L:  Probably not. [COUGH]
R:  You know, there's a -- a kid in Ohio, and I'm sure your husband and your boys have heard about.  But he's a high school kid and going to go pro --
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- LeBr -- well, Lebron James.  I mean, and it's like, you know, ninety -- I think --
L:  Ninety million dollars.
R:  Ninety million dollars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, you know, I -- I hope --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the kid turns out to be a total fizzle and not -- not because I -- so -- so like to show Nike.  You know, like, are you nuts or what? [LAUGH]
L:  Ninety million dollars for an eighteen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- year old kid. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, exactly.  Exactly.  And then when a pair of shoes cost a hundred dollars and you get to tell your kid, "No, we're not buying these". [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  We can't afford those --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what are you thinking?  
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're -- we're taking out the clearance rack. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's so [LAUGH] what we do too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, yeah -- I -- I -- I don't really understand h- how it got so out of control.  Because I know it wasn't like this from the beginning.
R:  Oh, no.  They didn't make a whole lot of money at all.
L:  And -- and a lot of 'em had a second job.  I -- I know the minor league players most of 'em have a second job.  They do something else the whole rest of the year.  But -- but, I don't know.  And -- and I -- I just wonder how it got so far out of control and -- and then to -- to strike because they're afraid they're not getting enough?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, do you think it's -- like, you always hear about the LeBron James that are making ninety million dollars and then you don't hear about the people that are making, like, the minimum salary?  Although I think in the NBA it's like a million dollars, so I don't feel too sorry for them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- either. [LAUGH]
L:  I know in, ah -- in baseball it's like two hundred twenty thousand a year.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, well they don't even play all year. [LAUGH]
R:  No, uh-uh.  It's a pretty sh- -- really. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  It is guaranteed whether they're actually playing or if they're sitting on the bench.
R:  Right.  And hardly anybody gets that deal in real life.
L:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]  If you don't come to work you don't get paid.
R:  Yeah, maybe they should do [LAUGH] something like that for them.
L:  [LAUGH] Like the guys that sit on the disabled list for two years in a row, still --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- racking up their --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, several million.
R:  Yeah, well, do you think these guys are just going to price them out of the market and people are just going to say, "Forget it, I'm not going to the games"?
L:  Probably.
R:  Is it like baseball, like, um -- like their [inaudible] really off?
L:  Yeah, they -- they, ah -- I -- I know that's what one of the big huge things was, with -- with the whole strike is that I -- I think they just can't afford to pay the players as well as they -- as they have been.  And -- and then it's also not equally distributed.  
R:  Right.
L:  So while the -- the teams in New York, you know, have all of these fans and they get all of this money, then the teams out in the middle of the country nobody ever goes to see because they don't have enough money to even put into the team as far as making it a nice stadium or, you know, having events going on there.  So, um, I -- I think that they're paying the players so much they can't afford to make it an enjoyable game for everybody to go watch.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I -- and I don't know about well, Baltimore, um, but in Cincinnati, you know, they keep holding the city hostages wan- --
