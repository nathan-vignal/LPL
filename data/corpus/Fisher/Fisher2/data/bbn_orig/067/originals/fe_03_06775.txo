L:  [NOISE] Yes, hello?
R:  Hello, my name is Veronica.
L:  [NOISE] Hi Veronica, my name's Deborah.
R:  Hi Deborah.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] And where do you live?
R:  I live in Seattle.  And you?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I live in Brooklyn.
R:  Oh, my. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH].  Yeah, super.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE] I figured it was a good topic.
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, were you anywhere near --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the twin towers when that happened?
L:  [NOISE] Unfortunately, yes.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  [NOISE] I happened to have had the misfortune of being near the twin towers both times. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] The first time I was not far.  I was at the -- the hospital that is like practically around the corner when they had the bomb go off.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  [NOISE] And then, ah -- then I was at a place called Ross[?] Institute and I was standing out front and all these -- it was like the world went crazy.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] There was just all these sirens and police and fire trucks and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- I was listening to Howard Stern on the radio before I went upstairs and, um, here I heard the plane had fallen into the building.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] And from there it just progressed to I think the strangest day of my life.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] I was upstairs, ah, ah, taking a class and she let us go of course because all of us were just too shocked and --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] And, ah, I had no way of getting back into Brooklyn because they had shut all the bridges and tunnels and subways.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  [NOISE] So I had fortunately met a friend -- made a friend in that class and we went to her place.  And just the act of walking to Ross Institute and -- and to this girl's apartment it was -- I can't even begin to explain it.  It was just hoards of people running down streets and smoke and everybody just very confused and dazed, and it was very unlike your average pushy New Yorker day.  They know what they're doing, very cocky kind of thing. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] It was just --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  [NOISE] -- everything had, like, shut down and it was just totally bizarre.  I couldn't --
R:  Oh, it sounds awful.
L:  [NOISE] It was horrible, it really was.  It was -- it was just something ...  You know, you always figure, okay you live in New York or, you know, if anything bad happens you're possible a target --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- but I guess nobody really expected it until something like that happened.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [NOISE] And --
R:  Did -- did you -- if you don't mind my asking this, did you end up losing anyone that you knew in -- in that tragedy.
L:  [NOISE] Um, unfortunately yeah.  I -- a friend of mine that I kind of grew up with.  He was a fireman --
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] -- and he [LAUGH] -- it was very strange because he was -- he died by, um, going near the building and he was hit by a person that was jumping out of the building.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know if you had heard about the, um -- the chaplain for the fire department?
R:  Um, I know that a chaplain died --
L:  [NOISE] His name was Judge --
R:  -- as a result.
L:  [NOISE] -- Judge something.  He was like the head chaplain for all the fire fighters.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] And he died giving my friend last rights.
R:  Oh.  Oh, dear.  Oh, my.  That must -- I mean, how traumatic for all of -- all of us, but especially for people who knew someone or -- or were right there as you were.  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] It --
R:  I -- I was -- you know, and of course across the country, and I was getting ready for work and I had the -- the national public radio on and I just heard them say something like --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- "Oh, a -- a plane has flown into the top of the you know the trade t- tower, one of the towers" and I thought, oh, there must have been an antenna and it probably clipped it, you know, and I --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- I didn't have the TV on and then the reports began coming in and I just --
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
R:  -- couldn't believe it.  But I -- I didn't turn on the TV and I'm so glad I didn't because I would have been so distraught I wouldn't have been able to work that day, and I had to be there that day.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  So, oh.
L:  [NOISE] You're a national public radio person? 
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, so am I.  I can't live without MPR.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] My whole life is like MPR. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] I listen to it at night time, all during the night when I'm sleeping.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [NOISE] I just love that station.
R:  I -- I love it too.
L:  [NOISE] It just has so much to offer.
R:  Indeed it does.  Um, since September eleventh have you felt that your life has changed in some permanent way or ...?
L:  [NOISE] Well, it took me well over a year to prac- -- not instantly break down into tears when I would see things on the TV.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [NOISE] So it did really impacted my life much more than I ever thought it would.
R:  Are you afraid to travel since then or ...?
L:  [NOISE] I was afraid to travel initially.  Um, I really don't go into Manhattan much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- so, um, I -- I -- you know, I guess after a while it passes because you really -- you have to get from one point to another and there's only one way to do it and that's transit.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [NOISE] So, I don't -- I -- I -- and the thought of it doesn't enter much into my mind now until they start bringing up things again like, you know, searching the subways and being afraid --
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] -- that something will happen there.  'Cause that would be horrible, being stuck in a subway --
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] -- like in Japan with the sarin gas.  
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my Lord, I can't even imagine that. 
R:  Oh, man.
L:  [NOISE] But, ah, yeah, it -- it -- it -- being a New Yorker it impacted my life greatly and -- and I think they still have a -- you see posters around and advertisements on TV for people that are still call -- phone -- this phone number. 
R:  Really?
L:  [NOISE] The people that are still having problems dealing with it.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [NOISE] And I just read in the newspaper recently that, ah, they've got record numbers of policemen and firefighters calling these phone lines and -- and having to, you know, get mental health care.  
R:  Sure and post traumatic stress.
L:  [NOISE] Oh. 
R:  It makes perfect sense.  Um, I can't even imagine.  Um, I'm -- you know, I'm so far away I didn't know anyone in -- in that area and all that.  And even so I get all emotional when I think about it, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  It was just so amazing.  And since then, um, I'm not a -- a fan of flying [LAUGH].  
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Not one of my favorite things in the world, but, um, my mother was not doing well that -- at that time and I wanted to see her before winter.  She was -- she was in Chicago and I had to fly.  And it was one month after September eleventh.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, scary.
R:  And -- oh, yeah.  It was -- it was so weird, um, to see national guardsmen at the airport.  I mean, I was glad they were there, I was glad precautions were being taken, but on my flight back, um, there was an anthrax scare on my plane.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  But, um, I don't know.  I guess -- I guess September eleventh for me has just made me realize how fortunate we've been in our country for so long.  For a lot of people in the world this is kind of a daily --
L:  [NOISE] It's an every day occurrence.
R:  -- occurrence.
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  Oh, I -- you know, you hear about the atrocities in different places, sometimes Government against the people of -- of the country.  Sometimes different factions in the country.  And it's just incomprehensible to me how people can go on after something like that.
L:  [NOISE] Until it comes and it happens in your back yard and then you realize life goes on no matter how different the world's become.  And we have been very spoilt as Americans.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] And -- and now everything h- h- has changed.  You know, and New York has kind of gotten back to normal.  We've kind of gotten used to living with a increased police presence and seeing people with rifles standing around in, like, Wall Street and places like that.
R:  Really?  Just --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- just as an every day occurrence?
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  Goodness.
L:  [NOISE] So you realize but, ah, you know, and time kind of heals all wounds.  You -- you -- the further you get away from it the -- the more desensitized I guess you become.
R:  [NOISE] I -- I imagine it's a survival instinct because --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if you -- if you had to live with that initial horror and trauma and feeling all the time afterwards, you couldn't -- you couldn't function, you know?  Um, wow.  Ah, has -- has the tragedy made you a more political person do you think or ...?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, politically more, I think, disgusted with politics --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- if anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] You realize, ah, politicians sometimes are just a lot of crap.  They -- they promise everything and they tell you what they want to hear, and then they're voted in and they have their own agenda.
R:  Right, right.
L:  [NOISE] And New York's really hard up for money right now, so it impacted -- and downtown New York is still really hurting financially.
R:  Really?
L:  [NOISE] It just devastated the whole area.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] And then, yeah, you've got areas like Chinatown.  And now they're dealing with things like SARS and --
R:  Wow.
L:  [NOISE] -- yeah, and they were hit initially economically from nine eleven and now SARS.  So, yeah, there are businesses that just didn't make it.  They didn't recuperate.  They couldn't financially --
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] -- just pull it off.  So it still has had its effect on New York.  It's just not as in your face.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Because I -- I know I was compelled to watch TV practically twenty four seven for weeks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- weeks afterwards. 
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] And it was also, ah -- it was also -- you can stop if you want -- it was also, um -- it's -- I don't know how to explain it.  Um, I -- I -- I just am kind of happy I live in Brooklyn.  Not that the -- you know, New York isn't a target --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- but I just couldn't wait to get home that day.  I felt --
R:  Did you end up getting home that day or did you stay with your friend?
L:  [NOISE] Finally that evening I was able to.  They opened the subways again and that was really --
