R:  Hi, uh, my name's Debbie.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, hi, I'm Michelle, and I'm twenty two and I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Hello, [SIGH] I'm --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- uh, thirty seven and I live in, uh, Mississauga, Ontario.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, okay, hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi.
L:  [SIGH] Um, I really haven't done -- I was out of the country when it happened and I was for, like, a long period afterwards and so it really didn't [SIGH] affect me in any way.
R:  Well, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I was at home.  Um, [SIGH] -- I've been going through a -- a traumatic experience in my life with my family [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, [SIGH] I -- I found out it -- it -- it just -- it really, really affected me. [SIGH] Um, I don't know, [SIGH] a- as far as changes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I try to be a bit nicer [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] I tried to get back in with my family [SIGH] which is [MN] -- they -- [MN] they basically booted me out of their life, so it was like, "Wow, okay [SIGH] --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- life is really, really short and you have no clue what's going to --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- drop out of the sky, so, hey, you know, this isn't worth it".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I tried that, but [SIGH] that didn't work, but I -- I think about it a fair bit and -- and sometimes I think people [SIGH] -- people forget too often and sometimes I -- I mean, like, I c- I ten- I c- I can go to extremes sometimes, but I think [SIGH] that sometimes people forget exactly what happened and should be forced to watch the planes hitting the building over and over and over and go, "Hello--"
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  "-- remember?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know. 
L:  [SIGH] Um, [SIGH] yeah, I know -- I know, it really -- yeah, it probably didn't have as much of an [SIGH] impact on me.  In Ontario, are you, in Canada?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, wow, so it had an effect even though you weren't in the country?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, [SIGH] yeah.  w- we also -- we live, um -- sorry, that's my birds yelling upstairs [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We -- we live right by an airport and it was [NOISE] the weirdest thing [NOISE] hearing nothing for days [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and then when it started it -- [MN] everybody collectively went, [SIGH] "Uh" you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and we participated in the, um -- the candlelit vigil [SIGH] and it was nice to see everybody out on the street and it -- it -- i- it was nice to see, even up here, [SIGH] people going, "Oh, my god" you know.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] No, I know.  I was in Italy, actually, when it happened and, um --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- [SIGH] yeah, and so -- but, like, I was in a small town there and they, like, even had a couple of little, like, vigils in the middle of it and then whenever I would travel around, like, in restaurants and people would find out I was an American, there was a [inaudible] [SIGH] they'd be usually, they'd say -- like, be really nice, and, like, come up and point out candles they had in the windows or, like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- bring flowers or something like that to the table, so 
R:  Oh, that is so nice.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, so, no, afterwards, like, it was really -- we were, like, [MN] all over, but I'm surprised that it was such a big deal in Canada too.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And stuff.
R:  Yeah, we were reading stories that, um [SIGH] [LAUGH] -- um, I forg- I can't remember the s- I think it's Gatineau in New Brunswick or Newfoundland or something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] but [MN] they shut the airspace down over here too.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And we took -- we took all of your planes that were on route to the states, [SIGH] and --
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, that's right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I remember that.
R:  And at one time there were so many planes landing at this one particular airport [SIGH] that the number of passengers on the planes outnumbered the population of that particular little town or city or whatever.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, and these guys -- people opened up their homes and -- and had the passengers stay with them and [SIGH] b- basically they stopped their lives to take all these people in and it was just -- it -- it -- it really had an effect on everybody a- well, as far as we know, anyways.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was -- it was nice to see them helping.
L:  Uh-huh.  Was that right near you? [SIGH] 
R:  Uh, no, no, that was --
L:  No.
R:  -- way far away for me.
L:  Oh, okay, [MN] 
R:  But, um, [SIGH] I'm lousy with geography, but I think it was, uh --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- hm, out west somewhere.  Northwest I th- I be- I believe, I'm not sure. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] No, I know, no [MN] -- and then, um, the airport thing.  I was in L.A. for the summer and [SIGH] the -- on what was it, the fourth of July, they had, like, the little airport thing there [SIGH] that happened.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you hear about that at all?
R:  Um, [NOISE] I'm not sure, refresh my memory. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah, it was in -- [SIGH] it wasn't a very big deal anywhere else, but, like, I remember, like, hearing warnings, like, because they thought, like, something might happen again on the fourth of July.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And then, like, [SIGH] I think the only thing that h- it was, like, just that shooting at, um, that Israeli airlines or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something when they shut down the airport for the day and the city was just like a mess for the day, but no one ever hear of it b-
R:  Wow.
L:  -- besides that, but [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, it didn't go national.
L:  No, no.
R:  Wow.
L:  But --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  No, I know.  So, that was my only, like, main experience [SIGH] of --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- [SIGH] September eleventh. [SIGH] But 
R:  I -- I -- I don't know, I fi- I find, uh -- [SIGH] I don't know, it just -- it -- it's --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- it really affected me big time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] So -- [SIGH] and I -- I -- it's --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- I wonder -- I -- I -- hm, [SIGH] I -- I wonder why it is sometimes that, uh, i- it seems to fade so far from memory sometimes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I mean, to an extent you have to, like, move on, though, and not [SIGH] focus on it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And everything. [MN] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's not, uh -- I mean, it -- it -- I guess it can be sort of uplifting at the end when you think, "Okay, stand strong and y- and go" but [SIGH] it sure isn't at the time. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, no, of course not.
R:  Ah, shoot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  But [SIGH] I m- know that Canada thing -- where is Ontario exactly in Canada?
R:  Um, we are, um, [LAUGH] sorry, lousy at geography. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's -- it's a -- it's a wide province, but basically we connect with -- [SIGH] yeah, I believe in -- in two places.  We connect with, uh, New York, which is what's closer to me, like, I'm -- I'm about an hour and change away from Buffalo. New York. [SIGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  So, like, and -- and Niagara Falls and that area, so I'm right there, [SIGH] but Ontario goes as far as, um, Detroit and it -- and, um, Windsor, so --
L:  Okay, no, okay, I think I drove through Ontario this summer at one point and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Okay, yeah, yeah, I strayed from New York, like, and then to -- yeah, and then I came out in, like, Chicago or something, or Detroit, maybe --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- somewhere around there. [SIGH] Okay. [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] I -- I like going to Niagara Falls, it -- it's neat to see that, uh, [SIGH] one of the world's greatest -- what do they call it?  Um --
L:  Natural wonders.
R:  Yes, thank you. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  No, no, yeah, I've never been there.  I wanted to stop by, but I was kind of in a hurry when I was driving through and it was just a [NOISE] [SIGH] boring highway route, so I didn't get to see anything. [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, oh, it's nice. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you ever wonder about, um, another one coming?
L:  [SIGH] Um, not -- not really.  I mean, [SIGH] there's -- there's so little you can do to prevent against it besides, like, basic diplomacy, [SIGH] you know, and so [SIGH] [MN] there's no point in, like, [MN] too exhaustively, like, spending your time dreading it or [SIGH] planning around it or anything, and even, like, traveling, and I'm not going to, like, delay any [SIGH] plans I have or -- or not [SIGH] go on a certain date or something because I'm worried about what's going to happen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and so 
R:  I agree with that, that's good.
L:  [SIGH] How about -- do you? [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [COUGH] excuse me. [SIGH] No, I agr- I agree with what you said.  Um, I kind of -- [SIGH] [MN] every now and then, you know, when your -- when your head gets kind of empty and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something pops in your head [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
R:  -- that tends to c- come in my head for me and it's like, you know, it -- it -- it tries -- [SIGH] I try to use to sort of focus, to go ahead, like, "Well, you never know what the hell's going to happen, so enjoy what you've got right now". [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Definitely. [SIGH] 
R:  But no, I haven't, um -- I -- no, I agree, I wouldn't stop.  If I had to go somewhere, I'd go, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's what you got to do, and pooh on them and deal with whatever the hell c- happens.
L:  Mhm. [SIGH] So, have you, like, continued to try to reconcile with your family or whatever since it [SIGH] happened, or did you just kind of 
R:  [SIGH] Um, unfortunately they made it very clear that they don't want anything to do with me, so 
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, well. [LAUGH] 
R:  It sucks. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Everyone has bad family situations sometimes. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, unfortunately this one's got to go to, uh, [LIPSMACK] legal proceedings.
L:  Oh, ouch.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I didn't want to play the game.  They started, so, oh, well, I go to play.
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Well, [LAUGH] hey, I don't know what to say next. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, me neither. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  So, you -- do you ever -- do you ever watch, um, some of the documentaries and stuff, or -- or did you watch at the time?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I -- the only one I saw was in a documentary film class for my college, actually in -- on the anniversary --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- last year.  They showed, um, [SIGH] one of the documentaries, but it wasn't one so much about the actual incident, it was one about the construction of the towers.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [SIGH] And so -- and so it was kind of dry [LAUGH] and not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, [SIGH] an emotionally pulling one in any sort of way, but that's the only document I have seen about it.  Ha- have you seen any?
R:  [SIGH] Um, yeah, me probably too many. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] W-
L:  Really? [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] I w- I -- I -- I watch all of them, you know, I -- and -- and -- like, uh -- my husband bought me one of the books that -- that actually collected, [SIGH] um, I believe it's all the survivors or, you know, it tries to tell the people's stories [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and th- these are what actually happened [NOISE] instead of just the numbers and things like that [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I ma [NOISE] -- I've got, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] then, uh, I think it's the C.B.S. [NOISE] documentary. [SIGH] The one that -- where the two French guys [SIGH] were, um -- who were making a documentary just on the firemen [SIGH] and [NOISE] they happened to go along on that day when [NOISE] everything happened. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, and they've actually got the -- the only footage that was done [NOISE] inside the towers as -- as they fell, and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I haven't even heard of that one, that sounds really interesting.  Was it --
R:  Oh, it is, it's -- it's really good.  I think you can pr- you can probably rent it at, like, a Blockbuster or something like that.
L:  Really?  Is that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- was it even in theaters, [NOISE] or was it just, like, on -- on video?
R:  Um, [NOISE] it was on TV and, um, I know they released it on video and DVD, it's -- hi Gerwin. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] Was it fairly soon after it happened, or ?
R:  Um, no, actually, I don't remember.  No, it might have been about, [MN] like, I don't know, could be six months to a year after it happened, something like that I believe. [NOISE] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  No, I'll have to look that one up --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- that actually sounds really good.  And so they -- [MN] how do they have footage, like --
