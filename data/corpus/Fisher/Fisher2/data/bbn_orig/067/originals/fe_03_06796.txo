R:  So --
L:  Hi, this is Tracy from Maine.
R:  Hi, I'm Anne from Massachusetts.
L:  Nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So how much do you know about professional athletes?
R:  Well, I don't know a lot about professional athletes and I didn't know there were any, um, strikes by professional athletes going on right now.
L:  Okay.  I didn't either but we'll see if we can make conversation for ten minutes here.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, okay, the last strike I had heard of I guess was -- I don't know, I guess was like last year or something when some of the baseball players and stuff they were threatening to go on strike 'cause they wanted more money as a team, but --
R:  Yeah, I've heard about a couple of like baseball strikes, but I don't know if I've heard about any in any other sports.
L:  I haven't either and when they said professional athletes, I mean, you don't usually hear about it in -- I don't know, I guess I don't follow a lot of sports, but like basketball and football and stuff I thought was more of an individual salary basis.
R:  Yeah, I think that if like basketball -- if the professional basketball players went on strike that we'd probably know about it.
L:  Probably.  You get more publicity out of it.
R:  [NOISE] Like baseball and basketball.
L:  Right.
R:  Maybe if, like, hockey or people in golf did it then --
L:  Then you'd hear more about it but they're all such individually based I think on their salaries but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you don't hear about it as much.  So do you know of any good baseball teams that you follow? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't really follow any.  I've been to a few Red Sox games 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't live too far away from the stadium but --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- that's pretty much it.
L:  Yeah.  So do you think they should go on strike to get more money?
R:  I don't -- I don't really think so.  Like, I mean, it -- I mean, it's hard to say.  Like, if -- if they're the talent and they're doing most of the work and they're not getting like a proportionate amount of money that, like, the team brings in, then I guess it --
L:  Are you there?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, sorry, it sounded like it cut out.
R:  Yeah, I'm just getting call waiting.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, so like I think that's fair but it seems like they make so much money that it doesn't really matter.
L:  I know.  I guess that's -- that's my biggest thing when I heard about it a few years ago.  I was shocked that, I don't know, they're making like, you know, up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars --
R:  Mhm, per game.
L:  -- for playing, like, a season of baseball or something and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, the average working person doesn't tend to make very much money and you actually work eight to ten hours a day and [LAUGH] five days a week.  I understand there's a lot of training involved that they have to go through --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know --
R:  I mean, I don't have a lot of sympathy for them for anything but, I mean, they're allowed.  I mean, I think it's -- I also think it's funny how, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- baseball can go on strike and it's this huge industry and it loses I'm sure, like, millions of dollars when the players go on strike and, like, no one interferes with it, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And, like, there has been those scandals when, like, air traffic controllers one year a while ago went on strike and, like, the President intervenes.
L:  Exactly.  I know, the whole world stops then but --
R:  Yeah, it doesn't -- it doesn't really make any sense to me.
L:  I know.
R:  Like -- if peo- -- if -- I mean, if the baseball players are going to go on strike, you know, like, as ridiculous as it may seem, like, maybe it undermines, like, when people in another, like, I don't know, maybe more legitimate professions do.
L:  Right and that's true.  I mean, if -- if, you know, people don't intervene for the important things that affect our day to day lifestyles but yet when a -- a hobby or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, what we consider to be a hobby, I -- I know it's their living but it's a hobby for them, the world stops as far as how can we get them to play?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I don't know, I think all -- like, when that sort of thing happens there seems to be, like, sort of, like, a sentimental reaction on the part of fans who are, like -- who feel, like, betrayed by their teams or, you know, take it in sort of like a more personal way --
L:  Right, because they --
R:  -- other than, like, these are just workers who are going on strike.
L:  Right, exactly.  But then they have -- I mean, they get paid as a team or even individually, there's so much money into that that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, you have to wonder, I mean, what is the stopping point for their salaries, 'cause you're always going to have someone coming up and better that, you know, the same qualifications and everyone that comes up is going to want to get more money.
R:  Yeah.  Do you know what the, um, demands are usually at the strikes?  Like, is it just, like, more money per season or is it, like, health benefits or ...?
L:  I only -- from what I've always thought it was more money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know that -- I mean, I really don't know what they get for benefits --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but from what I've always heard it's always been salarywise.
R:  'Cause I mean I think it would make more sense if it was about something that had to do with, like, playing conditions or, like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, safety conditions.  'Cause they -- what they do is, like, really physical work and if they have, like, I don't know outdated equipment or, like, they don't have the proper trainers or something to keep them in shape and to, like, keep them, like, healthy or, like, you know, take care of them when they have a sports injury.  Then, like, I think that's a reasonable, like, a -- like, a good reason to strike.  But it seems like since they are so powerful and they do get paid so much money that management would just, like, be more willing to let them sit it out and they wouldn't have to go on strike.
L:  Right.  But I think once they get into a position where they're special, like they're really good players, that feel confident that the team's not going to want to let them go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're -- you know, they're going to name their price and if you don't want to pay it then it -- we're going to go on strike or, you know, form up with the rest of the team to make it almost impossible for the team to play.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So then the owners are forced to come up with the extra money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You do it the other way around that is as far as the owners --
R:  Do you what union they're organized under?
L:  I don't know.  I don't know if it's separate or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if it's all one union for, you know, per sport or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or not.  I mean, I would think there would have to be something.  Um, but again I mean I don't know what their -- what their requirements are as far as how much you can push it and how much you can ask for and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I mean I also thought too that a union they worked with you as a team.  But I think the individual -- the individual players are more salaried based on themselves --
R:  Yeah, individual performance.
L:  -- confidentiality wise.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you never hear -- well, maybe you do I guess when they go on strike and it comes out, but it's not often that you hear so and so makes this much money and so and so makes this much money.
R:  Yeah, unless they've, like, just been traded or ...
L:  Right.  'Cause, like, you'd have half the team wanting to know why so and so makes more money and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- them all competing for the same amount.
R:  Yeah, I guess that makes sense.  Like if there are people who are, like, they -- they're having -- they're playing with, like, the same sort of game performance and they're being paid differently.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, I don't know why they would be.  Maybe if there was more buzz about a certain player or something.
L:  I guess too and depending on -- they must get paid differently depending on their positions and their stats.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know if, um -- I mean, I can't imagine they all start at the same amount of money.  It's got to be based on, you know, their specific training or how well they've done over the course of their career.  I don't know.
R:  So do you think it's, like, fair that they can go on strike and, like, paralyze the whole, like, industry?
L:  I don't think so because, I mean, personally that -- I think that if they're -- supposedly if they're going to play -- you know, this is just my personal opinion, but when you go into a sport like baseball or football or whatever, I mean these guys go into it because they love the sport.
R:  Mm.
L:  And when you go in and love a sport and you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars already, I mean, you're kind of getting your cake and eating it too type of the thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then, I mean, especially when you have people that -- I mean, I'm not bagging a sport, but you have people that normally will sit home to stay home and watch a game or, you know, you have to change a schedule to watch a game and it's more of a h- -- a pastime for them and when you -- when these people expect it and then they don't get it because, you know, someone's holding out for a pay raise -- I mean, if I don't go to work then what happens?  You don't go to work we're going to get fired and they're going to replace us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's no questions asked.  And we can hold out for a pay raise of course, but if we just demand we're going on strike and not coming to work without a pay raise most likely not matter where you are they're going to say forget it.
R:  Do you think that, um, sports players striking reflects more on like, the sports -- the, like, sports players or, like, unionizing, like, striking itself?
L:  It -- they don't -- I don't really know much about the union.  I think it's more -- I would think it's more the players.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, I mean, I don't the unions really get involved unless there is a problem --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I can't imagine that the union is going to tell all of these players to go on strike --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or force them to go on strike.  I mean, I would think that they're more like -- they're doing it as a team for their friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because if their friends get it, they're going to get it too, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, otherwise if, you know, someone came up and wanted a raise and they don't want to give to 'em, they could very easily just tell 'em no and trade 'em or however that works.
R:  I think, like, as compared to, like, other striking -- strikes that I've seen covered in the media, like, when the -- like, UPS goes on strike or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's sort of, like, portrayed more neg- -- like, it sort of says something about the process of striking.  Like, "Oh this isn't fair peo- -- businesses are losing money and people --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- like aren't getting their packages and stuff".  And when, like, baseball players do it it's, like, "Oh, those -- those people are -- they're just like out of their minds that they want more money", you know?
L:  Yeah, I think a lot of it is because of the fact that there aren't -- I guess in a business world there are more people that relate to something like UPS or the airlines or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something like that, whereas for sports, I mean, I guess they're not -- I have to admit that would be someone like me.  If I hear something like UPS are [inaudible] going on strike, I'm going to be concerned.  If it's something about baseball I'm going to say, "Yeah, they are, they're holding out for more money".
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it doesn't really affect me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess if I was one of the ones to sit home and have to watch the game, um, you know, to be that in to it I would be very concerned because that's just a past time that you lose.  But, I mean, a lot of these play offs and the, um, teams are paid by, like, commercial advertisements and these big --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- corporations that are sponsoring them so -- the businesses themself I imagine are hurt deeply if the players don't play.
R:  Yeah.  Do you -- do you know anyone who would be, like, really affected by the -- by the strikes --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- or who were?
L:  -- I don't really know anyone that's big into baseball.  Um, I mean a lot of people that are into hockey and golf.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I mean, certainly if we're flipping TV and there's a baseball game on, my daughter will probably watch it, but --
