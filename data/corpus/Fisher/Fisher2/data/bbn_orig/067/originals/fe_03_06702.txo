R:  Hi, my name is Cindy.
L:  Hi, I'm Chris, how are you?
R:  Good. [SIGH] Um, so do you, uh, w- exercise regularly? [LAUGH] 
L:  I try to, but not the -- not, uh -- not religiously.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I kind of -- when I'm -- when I'm apt to watch what I'm eating --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then I exercise. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  And then when I'm, uh, not watching what I'm eating [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [SIGH] I tr- I don't exercise.  It's terrible, that probably --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- when I should increase it, I think.
R:  Uh, yeah, I know --
L:  I m-
R:  -- same here.
L:  I m-
R:  But at least you do some, so  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sometimes, yeah.  I'm not -- not as good.  I do have, like, a knee injury too that's kind of, like, um -- I have to get an arthroscopy [LAUGH] on there.
R:  Ouch, ooh.
L:  So, well, I have -- you know, see what's going on and that's kind of, like, um, limiting what I can do now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, you know, excuses, excuses.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I know, right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's like me.  I'm like, "Well, [SIGH] that's too hard". 
L:  What do you do?
R:  Um, I don't do anything, I don't -- I don't exercise at all, I just -- [NOISE] I'm [SIGH] -- I have the time, I guess, I -- I should, [LAUGH] I'm a stay at home mum. [LAUGH] 
L:  I was going to say, do you have children?
R:  Yes, uh --
L:  Well, then you exercise. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Please. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, yeah, [SIGH] and mine's a two year old, so I'm running --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- after him all day. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, please, that has to count for something.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, you never sit down.
R:  Right.
L:  Especially at that age.
R:  [SIGH] You don't, I am constantly running.  My mum told me -- she was like, "You're going to drop some pounds now that he's running around". [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but, it's -- uh, you know, I get on these little tangents when I'm like, [SIGH] "Oh, I'm going to start exercising --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- and I'm going to star eating healthy and "
L:  That's right.
R:  [SIGH] And I -- it lasts, like, two days. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, it's so hard to do.
R:  [SIGH] It really is.
L:  It's hard to stick to, especially when you have little ones and if you've had a rather frustrating day [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know if you're like that?
R:  Oh, I stand at the kitchen and I eat. [LAUGH] 
L:  yeah.
R:  I eat my frustration away. [LAUGH] 
L:  There you go.  Or I have to have chocolate if I'm really upset.
R:  Oh, me too, so do I.
L:  I have a -- I have a treadmill upstairs, so that's pretty convenient when I -- when I'm on it.
R:  Really?
L:  Or, like, sometimes I'll take the kids for -- like, if they'll go on a bike ride, um, and I'll try to keep up with them walking while I [LAUGH] see --
R:  Yeah, well, that's good. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's kind of convenient.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I keep telling my husband, "Well, if I had a treadmill". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, yeah, that's real convenient --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- to get something at home.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  'Cause I -- I won't go to a gym.
R:  [SIGH] Really?
L:  Please. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  With all those young ladies? [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know.
L:  [SIGH] W-
R:  [SIGH] I --
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, me and my --
L:  It's -- it's --
R:  -- sister -- well, see, they've got one in town they just opened up, it's a Christian gym --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] and me and my sister are like, we're going to go there because they have a dress code and everything and I'm like --
L:  Oh, excellent.
R:  -- "Good, we don't have to stare at all these little [SIGH] --"
L:  That's right.
R:  "-- young girls in their g strings and " [LAUGH] 
L:  With -- with no children.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] While we're over here and [SIGH] she's pregnant, getting --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- ready to have hers next month and then I'm two years postpartum, still trying to get my weight off. [LAUGH] 
L:  I hear that.  
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, that -- that's a nice concept, a Christian one, wow.
R:  Yeah, yeah, it's really neat.
L:  What -- what state are you in, can I ask?
R:  Florida.
L:  Florida.  Wow, that's a nice concept, hopefully it'll move --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- up here.  I'm in Ohio, so 
R:  [SIGH] Oh, you're a ways away. [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it is, it's really nice.  I'm looking forward to it.  My sister in law used to go there all the time and, like, [SIGH] they've got, like, a smoothie bar in there and [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- they've got, like, all kinds of things, and then they -- like, the people that do the nursery are all people that go to my church, so [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, so, like, I know all the people and --
L:  You know -- and you know, they won't be talking about you. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right, right, [LAUGH] like, "Look at her and her --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- big thighs". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Good thing you're here, girlfriend, right? [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] Oh, that's bad.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But I got, um, some other things that I had bought from -- I don't know if you shop home shopping, since you're right there in Florida, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do you?  Do you shop there at home shopping network?
R:  [SIGH] I've bought a ring off there one time.
L:  OH, that's it?  You know, good thing you're not addicted, but anyway  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So I g- I take it you are? [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, I used to be, not any more.
R:  Really? [SIGH]  
L:  When I was young and single and, you know --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I could afford that kind of stuff, but --
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- um, but anyway, yeah, I had bought a couple of things that, um, uh -- exercise equipment that are just like clothes racks right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know -- you know what I'm saying? [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  That's pretty bad.
R:  Yeah, I know, I'm afraid that -- you know, that was -- that would be what would happen if I got a treadmill but [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then again --
L:  Well, they get --
R:  -- you know, it's so hot here in Florida, I just -- I don't like going outside to walk.
L:  Well, that's the thing.  Yeah, that's the thing, turn up the air conditioning.  They have, you know, um -- they have ones that are, like, not electric that you, um -- are smaller and you could, like, [NOISE] put 'em under your bed.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, yeah, really --
R:  That's nice.
L:  -- I think home -- I think home shopping has them. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Here -- here I am, I don't work for home shopping. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] That's funny.
L:  [SIGH] I'm pushing it. 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Here, use this card. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] No, I really don't work for them. [LAUGH] 
R:  That's funny. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] But anyway --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- um, [NOISE] yeah, so that might be something to think about, you know.
R:  [SIGH] That really neat, yeah, because see --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we just built a house and it's three bedrooms, but it's like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  --we just r- [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- with the amount of room --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- we have in here, it's just, like, that's going to really take up a lot of space if we had one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just sit out. 
L:  Exactly. [NOISE] 
R:  [SIGH] And that's been one of the reasons why we haven't gotten one, so 
L:  That's right, yeah, look for a fold away, you know.
R:  And is it electric?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I -- no, I -- it's self propelled.
R:  Oh, gosh, I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I could do that, I'd probably --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- kill myself. [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you go at your own pace, you know --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- you make it move in other words --
R:  right.
L:  -- for whatever you're doing, but, you know, just maybe you -- if -- if you got a Sears or something around you, I don't know if you -- what kind of stores you guys have, but --
R:  Yeah, we have a Sears, yeah.
L:  You know, that's a place to start.
R:  Yeah, and that's where my mum got here's.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She got, like, an awesome deal a long time ago.  She got an electric one for ninety nine dollars, it was like --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- [SIGH] a floor model, and they were like --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- [SIGH] getting rid of it and she just came across it.  I'm like, "No way -- [LAUGH] "
L:  Yeah, you --
R:  "-- that's not fair". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, no, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ask her to give it to you. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know --
L:  For the --
R:  -- right, [SIGH] but she --
L:  -- for the next --
R:  -- uses it, she wouldn't dare. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I was going to say for the next thirty birthdays, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] right.
L:  "It'll be good for that, you don't have to give me anything else [NOISE]" you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- whoops my beeper.  
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  How many call have you done with, um, Pen --
R:  -- [SIGH] 
L:  -- the U- U- University --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- of Penn?
R:  This is my sixth.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I did --
L:  I didn't know you c-
R:  [LAUGH] How many have you done?
L:  I thought they maxed us out at three.
R:  [SIGH] They do, but then you can enter in another phone number.  You can enter up to five numbers --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so I did my cell phone.
L:  Oh, excellent, yeah, this is -- is my third and I haven't gotten any payments, so --
R:  Me either, me --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, so --
L:  That's why I was like -- yeah. 
R:  -- I'm, like -- I'm hoping I get one soon. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I didn't want to get off topic, but I was curious to see if, uh -- you know, what's happening with that.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, anyway, so -- 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- what's your weather doing there?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, gosh, it's -- it's very humid and hot. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] It's, like, up near a hundred. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Oh, for god's sake.
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- I w- I wouldn't haven guessed that.  We're, um -- we're probably at about sixty, maybe, my gosh, in the daytime?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, like --
L:  Yeah, April and --
R:  Oh, you are so lucky.
L:  April's really -- well, it's cold, though, I mean, you're still putting sweaters on, you know.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, that'd be great, see, we don't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- never get to wear sweaters, hardly. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, uh, yeah, I would miss the, um -- I would miss the seasons.
R:  Yeah, see, we don't have fall and we don't have spring really, so 
L:  Yeah, spring's my favorite.
R:  [SIGH] spring, yeah.
L:  See, and that's when I want -- that's when I want to exercise. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] That's when I start getting motivated.
R:  [SIGH] You get motivated and then it starts getting hot, and you're like, "Oh, never mind". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'll just cover up a little bit more. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] that's bad. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I don't know --
L:  But any-
R:  -- and then I don't eat healthy, it's, like, I go into town and, [SIGH] "Oh, let me just swing into McDonalds, it's so convenient" and  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, it -- isn't it, though?  I'm telling you, and it -- there's -- there's so many fast food choices anyway [NOISE] --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know.
R:  And then you see a commercial and you're like, "Oh, that looks so good".
L:  Oh 
R:  And you head straight up there for it. [LAUGH] 
L:  And don't they always come up on TV --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- when you're hungry and you're on your diet?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, I know, I know.
L:  It's like you never see 'em any other time.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] It's terrible.
L:  [LAUGH] Look at that whopper, I'll take it, I'll take it. 
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] [SIGH] I know, I'm bad. I -- it's a good thing we don't live next to each other. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] We'd never get anything done. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] That's funny.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, but --
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] I --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- um -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't know, I just -- [SIGH] I need to, uh --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- get more motivated and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really stick to something --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- instead of saying I'm going to do it and then two days later, "Oh, never mind, I'm tired --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- of this".
L:  Yeah, well you guy -- you have it rough, 'cause it's, like, swimsuit season all year round --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- whereas, like, with me, there's a very definitive, "Here come June --"
R:  I know.
L:  "-- if you think you're getting into a swimsuit, you better do something" you know.
R:  Yeah, right, right, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that would be hard.
R:  [SIGH] I know.  Like, this -- well, I've always worn a bikini, but this year i told my husband, "Mm, mm, mm, I'm not putting one of those on". [LAUGH] I went and got one of the little tankinis -- the, like, two piece --
L:  Oh, but --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- those a re cute.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  Yeah, I can't even do that. [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] [MN] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm -- I'm forty three [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, that --
L:  -- forty three year olds don't need to be in something like that, sorry.
R:  Right, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, see [SIGH] I'm twenty three, but now that I'm a mum, I'm just like --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- "Well I just don't feel comfortable" --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, but you're --
R:  -- even though [SIGH] I mean --
L:  -- young enough, you know, show it off.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, really, if I was twenty three with one --
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  -- and I looked good, I would do it.
R:  My sister keeps telling me the same thing --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- she's like, "What is your problem, you're not overweight, w- [SIGH] you're in --"
L:  And then you hear -- people will say, "Hey, look at her, she's got a kid and she looks so great".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, there you go. [LAUGH] 
R:  I know, I know, right. I -- I don't know, I just -- [SIGH] well, I do have a little spare tire I need to get rid of. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I, um -- I was one twenty two when I got pregnant --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then I gained twenty nine pounds and then --
L:  That's not bad.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, but the, like, I cam home and I was one twenty six [SIGH] and instead of losing after I came home, I gained --
L:  Did you?
R:  -- and now I'm up to a hundred and thirty and I need --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to lose ten pounds --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- really bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and that doesn't sound like a lot, but I really can [NOISE] understand what you're -- you're fee- your frustrations.  I mean, I have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot more to lose, I have, like, thirty.
R:  Really?
L:  So, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I've learned, you know, try and do it in increments --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- say, "Okay, I'm going to -- my goal is five pounds".
L:  Right.
R:  And then you get a treat, like, get your hair done or something --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] because --
L:  I'll have to try that.
R:  -- that's, like, what I've been trying to do [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, and I did, I lost three pounds in two weeks when I laid off the fast food [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [SIGH] but then --
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
R:  -- like, [SIGH] I just couldn't stick with it and [SIGH] yeah, I just -- I really need to stick with it. [LAUGH] 
L:  No, that's a good idea, laying off the fast foods.
R:  yeah.
L:  I just kinda -- like I said, I kind of binge, you know, I'll be good for a while and then I think, uh -- here's the problem, I'll step on the scales --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and even though my -- you know, which is stupid because the scale is not really ac- accurate --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- 'cause you can be smaller but you're not necessarily losing weight.
R:  Right.
L:  So, and then I blow it, 'cause it's, like, you know, the needle didn't budge. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's the same way I am too --
L:  Yeah, that's-- it's hard.
R:  -- [SIGH] and then -- and then soda.  It's, like, I love coke and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] I've tried --
