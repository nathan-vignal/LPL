R:  Ah, hi.  
L:  Hi, I'm Julia.
R:  Ah, Julia, my name is Angela.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Ah, well, ah, what changes would you say y- you've made since September eleventh?  I'm sitting here trying to --
L:  Trying to think?
R:  Yeah, trying to think about what changes I've made.  I -- I -- maybe in my perspective I- I'm thinking, you know, and how I -- I kind of view life.  That was such a surprising thing.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  I think that it -- it -- I definitely, um -- it shocked me I think in a lot of different ways and I think I think about -- I don't know, like I thought it -- immediately afterwards I think I thought about traveling a lot differently and I think I have -- I live more at living that I am -- I think I -- I noticed a little bit more about living in America and being part of America in a way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For -- for some reason I -- I became more aware of being American and what that meant. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think it -- it kind of changed my perspective on [COUGH] patriotism also.  I -- not that I -- I took it for granted before then, but I mean I just felt I -- I -- I d- -- strongly patriotic during that time and yeah I -- I remember I was in a -- I was in another room and my husband I remember that morning said, "You got to come here and look at this on television".  And we thought well, maybe some accident has happened, somebody accidentally flew -- flew the plane in.  But then, I mean, we were looking at it the second plane flies in and then the thing at the Pentagon and it was just I -- I -- I have never had anything shock me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, that much.  I think for about one or two months I just was -- I don't know, just a weir- -- on a weird emotional level.  I mean I -- I never forget the emotional during, ah, Christmas songs are being played and the -- you know, in the malls and things like that.  But I remember that that first Christmas after it happened they started playing, ah, you know, this is the Christmas carols that the piped in music and I -- I mean I felt -- I -- I was crying because I thought America will never be the same again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I thought the last time I heard these songs we just -- you know, we kind of took it for granted.  Now you hear it and you know it's never going to be exactly the same.  I mean, like you said, um, I'm -- I'm not -- I'm -- I am still not comfortable w- with the idea of traveling, ah, by plane.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, okay, so maybe you -- you've changed wanting to travel by plane --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a little bit more?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that I'm -- I'm definitely like -- I, um -- I actually had a class that I was going to be taking and the guy cancelled because of, um, September eleven and so that immediately changed what was happening in my current life, you know?  And I just remember I was actually traveling across country --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, with a friend.  And the day it happened we were leaving Utah and, um, we left -- we checked out of the hostel, um, we were staying and, ah -- and I -- I saw it on TV and I just didn't even know how to react.  It was just really weird 'cause we weren't listening to a radio and we were kind of in this own little world, you know?  And then we get out of the car to get gas and it was just weird, like, watching all these different people just having this really grief stricken look on their face.  And I -- I definitely, um, I don't know, I -- I wanted to -- always wanted to travel overseas and everything, and after that happened I -- I was a little less eager to just kind of escape from my country and, I don't know, I -- I definitely think about flying more [LAUGH] I guess too. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's like a [COUGH] I don't know, a different kind of paranoia that's in the country now because, ah, people are a little more wary of -- of people.  We have like the -- ah, every week there's some warning of the orange level or the -- the m- -- whatever the colors they have.  Magenta level --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'bout how, ah -- you know, the terrorists, ah, possibility is.  I mean, we didn't -- we didn't have to contend with those kind of things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess when you grow up in America and I mean other countries I -- I'm -- I'm certain that they're very used to that.  So that -- I mean, it's commonplace for them but I mean it -- like those kind of things don't happen here.  But I mean then it happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's like if it happened one time then it can happen other times.
L:  Right.  Yeah, I definitely -- my security, definitely.  I mean, you don't feel as secure and I think in a big way it was a major wake up call to -- to -- to me and I -- you know, probably everyone to some degree of, you know?  I mean, how secure are we, you know?  And I'm sorry -- I think more than anything I have -- I don't think I've changed -- made any drastic changes in my life, but just more of an awareness of, you know -- of -- well, and how we're viewed in other countries, you know?  Just a more awareness of -- of how people look at us, you know, and -- and maybe -- I don't know, I think it's brought up a lot of questions in my life as -- you know, as what can we do that's different, you know?  Versus just going to war and, I don't know, I'm just kind of trying to figure out, like -- you know, I don't -- I don't want people to continue to hate us, you know, so it's like is there anything we can do to make, um -- that we need to be more aware of?  So I guess I just feel like the only thing as -- I just what basically what we're talking about is just on the emotional level that it really affected me, but I can't really say that, you know, like I do anything in my daily life.  I just think there's definitely -- emotionally I'm more aware of my country and -- and being part of this country and -- and how I'm viewed as being an American I guess.
R:  I -- I guess until that -- that day happened I said I just never had any idea --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- anybody hated us that much --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that -- to do that and how they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they justified in their mind that, ah, you know -- that was -- they felt that that was their only option to do.  But I thought these are, ah -- oh, I felt so horrible when they were, um -- you know, for a few days there were people looking for their loved ones in the World Trade Center, they were holding up their --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pictures and I just thought, "This is so sad".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's just so sad 'cause like -- and in one sense you didn't want to look at it and -- and another sense you just compelled, you know, to keep looking at it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But as far as making [COUGH] changes in -- i- in my life I -- like you said it -- it's changed my perspective on how I view a lot of things but I felt -- but if I -- if I stop doing too many things then that gives -- that's like saying to that terrorist, "Okay, ah --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- see I've -- I've accomplished what I set out to do" and I -- I don't want to give them that satisfaction.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, I mean life has to go on most definitely and a- -- yeah, that, ah, just seeing the resilience of -- of -- of Americans too.  You know, we like had a huge tragedy and -- and a lot of, um, people really tried to -- to come together in a lot of different ways.  And I think that there was some positive things that came out of it, and I think we saw how strong we are in a lot of different ways.  Um, how much resources we have and our ability to, um -- to try.  You know, everyone was in -- that was trying to help us and trying to do everything they could even though it was like -- you know, there wasn't a lot at that point.  There's just so -- so much destruction, but the American spirit was pretty amazing.  You know, it's like we've -- we've got to do --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- something and -- you know, I think our -- the hearts went out to everybody, you know, that knew someone or whatever.  You know, so I -- I don't know, I just thought that was -- I don't know, I -- I feel like overall I just learned a lot about my country that I [inaudible] just took for granted I guess.  So --
R:  Well, I'm -- you know, I -- I wish everybody had did -- kind of kept that perspective.  It hasn't --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- hasn't changed in everybody.  I think everybody was stunned for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a- a- about a month or two and some people just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- went into a thing where ei- either they didn't change anything or some people coped with that kind of thing by just kind of dismissing it because it's just -- it -- it -- it's too -- too much for them to contend with, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but for me, like I said, there -- there's some things yes I do still feel wary about, but I'm not about to let terrorists --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, think that they can, you know, ah, do this kind of thing and then, ah, you know, get -- get a victory --
L:  Right.
R:  -- over me.  I -- I don't -- I don't want them to --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- to, you know, think that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean we do, we have to -- we have to continue -- I mean life will go on that's -- I mean, definitely.  It just has to, you know, and -- and we will persevere, you know?  So -- but, um, yeah it was pretty amazing.  I mean, I just remember the churches being full, like, 'cause I was traveling and -- and I was in New Mexico -- I happened to be in New Mexico, um, right afterwards and it was just -- there was just -- the churches were full, like out to the edge, you know.  You -- it was like standing room only and -- and I was like standing in the doorway. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it was just really amazing, it was just kind of like everyone was kind of like, "What -- what is the answer to this?  This is just too -- too much [LAUGH] to -- to -- to handle on our own", you know?  And, um -- but it's just -- but, you know, life goes on and we -- and we definitely have to just keep, you know -- you know -- we just -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't if you could call it change but I, ah -- well, I -- I -- I've taught for a number of years.  I -- I'm not teaching now 'cause I -- I -- I retired early and, ah, but I still work in the capacity of -- of, ah -- working along with kids and I thought the -- the -- the way you had to change and how you -- you -- you communicate things to [inaudible] and I thought these poor kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I thought I -- I -- I grew up in -- at a time when -- I mean, we've had different things happen -- happen as far as social things are concerned and, ah -- and, you know, social changes and -- and this in American society, but -- but nothing like this.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- nothing like people blowing up buildings and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, you know, threatening, ah, things and [MN] I just -- nothing like that.  And the things that kids have to contend with and how you have to explain it to them and I --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- keep thinking, "What you know -- what -- what are they -- how are they really dealing with it?"  
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I mean, they're living in a completely different world than I --
