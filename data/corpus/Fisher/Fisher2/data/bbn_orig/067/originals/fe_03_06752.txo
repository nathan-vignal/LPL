R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Angel. [NOISE] 
L:  A- Say that again.
R:  My name is Angel, A.N.G.E.L.
L:  Angel? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, great. [SIGH] My name is Brooke.
R:  Hi, Brooke.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, h- w --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- is this your first call, second call, third call?
L:  [SIGH] This is my third call. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, [MN] it's my second.
L:  [SIGH] Uh-huh.
R:  But I keep catching people on their third, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  Well, it's been interesting and fun, I've enjoyed it.
R:  What other topics did you have?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, the minimum wage.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Whatever [LAUGH] [inaudible] [SIGH] and what was the other one?  I can't remember right now, but 
R:  I had movies, so pretty generic, but this one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- seems neat. [SIGH] So --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, what changes have you made since September eleventh, if any?
L:  [SIGH] Um, well, let me think for a second. [SIGH] I'm -- by the way, let me -- [SIGH] uh, where -- where are you calling from?
R:  [SIGH] I'm calling from Cambridge, Massachusetts, but I'm a Texan by birth, so 
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm calling from Nevada City, California, which is [SIGH] in the foothills of the Sierras.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, yeah, it's a --
R:  That sounds beautiful.
L:  -- beautiful summer day here.
R:  I imagine, wow.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's not a beautiful summer day here.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] dear. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] At all.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  It's, like, forty degrees outside, and raining.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, it's been that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- way all week.
L:  [SIGH] Oh, my gosh.  Well, it's about eighty five out here. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, gosh, wonderful, wonderful.
L:  [LAUGH] So, yeah. [SIGH] Yeah.  So, um, [MN] let me ask you another question because it actually sort of relates to the topic.  How did you get the name Angel?
R:  [SIGH] Oh, it's not my birth name, my birth name's Angela, but I had a friend when I was younger who said I was just like an angel and it stuck. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
R:  -- so, and especially --
L:  -- what a wonderful --
R:  -- since it's so close to my birth name it's easy to, uh -- to get away with.
L:  [SIGH] It's -- that's wonderful and what a great compliment from a friend.
R:  I know.  How nice, huh? [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But it was fun that it stuck with me, it's -- you know, it's nice 'cause obviously it's easier for people to remember --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- a little different.
L:  So, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] the reason that I m- [LAUGH] that I [SIGH] asked you is that, uh, [SIGH] let me see, right, uh, [MN] -- I guess shortly before September eleventh, I found a spiritual teacher that I really wanted to be with here in this area.  And it was a great comfort to me during September eleventh to, [SIGH] um [LIPSMACK] -- to be in the group that's around her.  She's a -- she's human being who actually is totally unconditionally loving, [SIGH] and it's quite an experience to be with someone who has that capacity.
R:  Wow.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh -- [SIGH] and since then I've been a part of her group, and, um, [LIPSMACK] we meet every Sunday and it actually feels like there's tremendous angelic presence that comes in, [SIGH] and, um, during that -- right after September eleventh, I spent a lot of time on the internet and -- and talking with my friends all over the country [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- v- via email, and I -- [SIGH] I just -- it was very comforting to me--
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- to get a lot emails of people that were saying this is --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- much larger than it seems.  This is not just about terrorism, it's really about a change in humanity and [SIGH] it's really -- it's really a -- a -- [SIGH] it's leading to a positive unfoldment, don't think that it's just leading --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to the end of the world, [SIGH] and that was extremely valuable for me.  It really felt like it kept me sane --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah --
L:  -- [SIGH] during that time.
R:  -- pretty, um -- pretty -- say to -- uh, you know, look I think [SIGH] but it did -- it did --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- kind of remind me that as well.  I've experienced -- I'm a young person, I'm twenty four years old and [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I've experienced a lot of death in my life, um, all of young people.  In fact, my grandfather died last year, was the first [SIGH] person that I knew that I kind of -- [MN] from my perspective in life, absolutely, like, it was his time, you know, but --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- everyone else has died [MN] what I consider somewhat prematurely, age wise.
L:  Wow.
R:  [SIGH] Um, just friends, you know, tragic accidents, um, you know, murder, [SIGH] suicide, like, a lot of different stuff, [SIGH] so --
L:  Gosh, that's very usual.
R:  -- I think September eleventh affected me less than most people because [SIGH] it was sad and it was horrible, but I have sort of this different take on death than most people have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] Um, and I did kind of have that same feeling that you've men- that you just mentioned [SIGH] in that it sort of reminded me of a funeral [SIGH] in the kind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of way that -- you know, it's -- [SIGH] it's part of the bigger thing, I mean, and it's just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the way things are and -- and the way that funerals bring together old friends [SIGH] that have probably not been speaking, you know, for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lord knows how long [SIGH] and for -- [MN] you know, for just stupid reasons, [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- something tragic happens, and it's unfortunate that that is what it takes to bring people together sometimes, but it just is, [SIGH] and --
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I think that's a pretty natural process, you know.
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] and I --
R:  [SIGH] And, um that's definitely what happened I think after September eleventh.
L:  [SIGH] [MN] 
R:  [SIGH] A lot of people taking more care to pay attention to daily life and to each other. [SIGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I totally --
R:  [SIGH] Um, which is nice.
L:  -- agree.
R:  You know pretty fabulous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] But, I mean, I definitely didn't make any changes that were tangible, I mean, I'm still traveling abroad as much as ever. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Um, my parents, you know, wish I wouldn't, they're always scared now --
L:  [LAUGH] Well.
R:  -- more than they were before. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, good for you for --
R:  But --
L:  -- going on with your life. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I mean, it's like I tell my parents, I just -- I honestly believe that whoever these people are or whatever is happening, I mean, you're -- they're accomplishing what they want if people's lives are changing and [SIGH] you know, but --
L:  [SIGH] Yes, well --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- and it's probably still the chance of getting hit on the freeway in a car accident --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- is probably [SIGH] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- a million times higher --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- than -- [LAUGH] than having any problems with terrorists. [SIGH] 
R:  Exactly, and we take risks every day, it's just [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, obviously it was a catastrophic event and there were so many people involved [SIGH] but, um -- but, yeah, you know, we lose more people on the freeway every year.  We certainly lose more people to AIDS or to cancer.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's for sure.
R:  Um, [SIGH] you know, but I think -- yeah, I think if people can put it in that perspective, I do -- you know, I think it's unfortunate that we've had this sort of zealous rebirth of [SIGH] misaligned patriotism.
L:  [SIGH] To say the least.
R:  -- Um, this -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] It's a --
R:  [SIGH] It's kind of unfortunate but I guess to be expected, so  [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] I keep hoping that, um, [LIPSMACK] the religious right is [MN] really showing [MN] what they're really about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so strongly [SIGH] that eventually enough people will wake up and say, "Hey, this isn't us, [LAUGH] and we don't want to be a part of this". 
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but, you know, if they didn't do it jerry Falwell and [inaudible] -- how many times as he's put his foot in his mouth --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] I can't imagine, but, yeah, I don't know, I mean, that is what amazes me is when things like this happen, and [SIGH] -- and there are the people that instead of a rebirth of humanity, they just, I mean, I don't know isolate themselves more somehow.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
R:  And, um, it's really sad.
L:  That's true.
R:  I do -- actually, I -- this makes me think of something.  I was in, um -- oh, gosh, where was I?  in Scotland somewhere, [SIGH] um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at this religious exhibit of all these different religions and they have this amazing photography exhibit upstairs, and I do some photography on the side, and, so, I went up to check it out and it was all photographs of Muslim peoples throughout mostly the Sudan, but some other countries as well. [SIGH] and I just remember sitting there and I actually broke down into tears because I thought, you know, I couldn't ima- I mean, this was right after September eleventh, like, maybe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, four months.  And I remember thinking I couldn't imagine that these whole groups of people would be [SIGH] -- they would be further divided, and looking at these children's faces in these photos and thinking, you know, we're all just people, [SIGH] and, uh --
L:  Oh, man, [SIGH] yep. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, and the unfortunate hatred that was going around at that time I think -- just, like, kind of blanket, blind hatred towards, [SIGH] you know, Muslim people or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Middle Eastern people or Arab people. [SIGH] And I just --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] 
R:  -- remember thinking, "Well, how sad".  And then -- and if that's all someone takes out of this then they're missing the boat, you know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] That's for sure.
R:  [MN] 
L:  Well, I think it really did wake up an awful lot of people and [SIGH] I'm definitely concerned about how much, uh, the Bush administration --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and the, [SIGH] um [COUGH] -- their corporate cronies [LAUGH] control the media --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and stuff like that because, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- it feels like everybody is being really polarized --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um [MN] -- and I think that's so sad because what we need is actually -- [SIGH] we need open debate and we need people thinking really about in- instead of form a place of fear, really about [SIGH] what it is that we can do to -- [SIGH] to help ourselves as a nation, and the whole world.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] it's just [SIGH] --
R:  We are people as people.
L:  -- so sad to see us pouring money into a -- [SIGH] a war and having the country, uh, in some ways in worse shape now than even when Saddam was there.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So --
R:  Well, this U.S.A. Patriot Act, I think it's kind of strange, nobody's talking about it anymore, 'cause it, um -- [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] it's pretty troubling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] it's pretty troubling.  I'm a law student, so we definitely --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] have read up some in crimin- criminal law, um, on the Patriot Act and just kind of discussed its coming within its purview and, [SIGH] I mean, it's pretty troubling and that we talked about for, oh, about a week. [LAUGH] 
L:  I bet, I bet. The l- yeah, the little bit I've found out is pretty [SIGH] scary.  So which law school are you at?
R:  [SIGH] Um, I go to Harvard law School.
L:  Uh-huh.  I am a Stamford graduate. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, wow, awesome, yeah, I have some friends here that went to Stamford undergrad, they loved it.
L:  Uh-huh. [SIGH] 
R:  I'm sure everyone going to Stamford law School is much happier right now than us. [SIGH] 
L:  W-
R:  It was a really bad year. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a really bad winter.
L:  Oh, oh, okay.
R:  Stressful year and bad winter together, and if you're from sunny climates like me, then it starts to just really weigh on you. [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Um --
L:  [SIGH] I should -- I should tell you what I'm about.  It, um -- 'cause it -- y- I don't know, it might relate to some of your friends. [SIGH] The reason I'm doing these calls --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- is that, um, [LIPSMACK] the business I do, I'm called a certified debt consultant and I help people who've --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- really gotten stuck in credit card debt --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to get out of debt in just a couple of years with a program called debt settlement in a financial management firm that's out here, but I have clients all over the country. [SIGH] so, I'm always looking for ways that some of my clients can learn a little extra money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I found this on the internet and I thought, "Okay, I'll just do the three calls --"
