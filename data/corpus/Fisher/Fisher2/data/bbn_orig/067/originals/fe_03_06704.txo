R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  -llo.  Hi.  I'm Cara.
L:  I'm Janet.
R:  Hi, Janet.  Nice to meet you. 
L:  Nice to meet you too. 
R:  [MN] Um, [LIPSMACK] what area are you in?
L:  I live in Northern Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Sou- -- I'm in Houston, Texas. 
L:  Ooh.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, so health and fitness, do you exercise regularly?
L:  Well, I'm supposed to.  I regularly think about exercising regularly. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I've tried multiple times to get into a regular routine, and I do walk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- regularly.  
R:  Oh, well, that's good. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's not enough. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I hear you.  I was actually, [MN] right before this phone call came, just thinking, "What am I going to do?  I've got to do something". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think I do better if I do something outside the house than having something here.
L:  [inaudible] Yeah, it -- it -- being outside is always -- is always better.
R:  Yeah.  I -- it's just -- I -- it's so hard to put it off, if there's something to distract you inside the house. 
L:  Oh, yeah, I mean, it's easy to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, it -- it's hard to get going to do it and then you get a phone call or something and then it -- 
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's easy -- for me it's easier if I go somewhere.
L:  So, what do you usually do?
R:  Nothing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Noth- -- never nothing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or -- or recently --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- nothing, or ...?
R:  -- I have a five year old, he hasn't started school yet.  He's going to be starting school in -- I try to do workout tapes at home [NOISE] or I try to walk and [NOISE] I've worked out before, but it's just nothing that lasts for a long period of time. 
L:  No, not with a five year old. 
R:  [NOISE] No. [LAUGH] As you can hear, he's in the bathtub. 
L:  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- that's, ah --
R: [NOISE]
L:  -- that was difficult.  Actually my son is -- who is now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- almost thirteen, has been -- has helped the exercise because we live in a community --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mostly kids don't walk to school and, you know, at various ages --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but we were close enough --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that, um, I've, um, been walking him to school since he was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in first grade.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it's about three quarters --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a mile to each of the school -- each way. 
R:  Oh, that --
L:  So I've --
R:  -- great.
L:  And it's been really good, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's been good exercise, but it's also been a good way to -- he tends to talk when we walk.  
R:  [NOISE] Oh. 
L:  So, we -- we -- we stay in touch -- 
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  -- that way. 
R:  -- good. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  W- -- so it's actually a good habit for him.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- teaching him exercise.
L:  Yeah, he gets mad because other kids get driven all the time and he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it didn't bother him so much when he was younger, because they -- the other kids took the bus and the bus, um -- we were at the beginning of the bus route -- the bus would take longer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- than walking and he couldn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stand sitting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- quietly for that long.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But now that the, um -- there is no --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bus, he's at an age --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- other kids' parents that [inaudible] live down the street, they all drive, and so he -- he gets a little miffed --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but -- but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- we tell him, if we can walk we walk and I think -- I'm -- hopefully, yeah, it'll stick with him.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I'm -- I'm overweight, but he's not, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, and I think that's the key, is getting into a habit early -- earl- -- I mean, the earlier you're the age to get in the routine of exercising and making it a priority in your life --
L:  [SIGH] Right, so --
R:  -- is --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- it tends to stay with you through -- throughout. 
L:  Yeah, so instead of thinking automatically you get driven, walking is an option. 
R:  Right.  Well, I would think that it'd be good to, you know, set a boundary and say, "If it's less than a mile, then I'm walking" or, you know, something like that. 
L:  Well, that's why we -- we bought our house where we did, where we can -- we walk pretty much everywhere.  It's just we -- my husband and I have bad backs, so we won't walk if it means carrying groceries back or something --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- heavy. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So if I'm lugging books to the library or something, then I tend to --
R:  Get back in the tub until I'm off the phone. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm sorry. 
L:  I'm -- that's all right.  I --
R:  He's standing there without his [LAUGH] clothes on, just dripping. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I --
R:  But --
L:  -- know what it's like, though.  Frankly it's -- it's hard unless you -- you flash back, when you say things like that, but I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- really do have a hard time remembering --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- back to -- to five sometimes because --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- now, I mean, everything, you know, adolescence is the big --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- focus.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, you know, he also has a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bike.  
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  And --
R:  And so, does he ride his bike a lot?
L:  Well, he just rides it very short distances, but he -- he does ride it sometimes and, um, more than I've ridden --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mine, but we did yest- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually this weekend my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- husband --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I went out and bought a -- a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good quality recumbent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- bicycle --  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to put in the house in front of the television. 
R:  [NOISE] I, yeah, [NOISE] see, if I could watch T.V. and exercise [NOISE] at the same time [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, we, um, we couldn't do it before because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there -- the room was, like, at one point --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was full of lego and at one point we were worried about him getting hurt.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But now he's at an age, and [MN] we can -- we can --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we decided we don't care what the family room looks like, if it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [inaudible] exercise equipment.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, we're trying the one piece --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and if that works, may end up getting two --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a second one --  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, too, because the weather's been horrible.  
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  I mean, we've had --
R:  I can understand that. 
L:  -- we've had so much rain, it just keeps raining.  In the winter was -- it was the worst snow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ice winter, we couldn't even walk out, so one reason we've gotten into -- out of habit of -- 'cause normally we would just walk, so we figured maybe we'd try something else. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, so we don't have an excuse --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- when it's [inaudible] -- 
R:  Are there -- but it -- I don't know what it is about the T.V. but if you can watch T.V. the time just passes by so fast. 
L:  Yeah, we'll -- we'll see when I'm -- I'm on the bike [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If -- at the same time we bought the -- the exercise bike, we bought a, um, [MN] D.V.D. player so that we could put movies on.  In, you know --
R:  Oh, that's a good idea.
L:  -- don't like, if there's nothing, 'cause it's rerun reason, so we [several inaudible words] so we have no excuse. 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Um, [LAUGH] to, um, not use it.  They just didn't have any in stock so it might -- it'll be, ah, ten days before we get it, but, um, so, I mean, we're -- we're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I tried to do gyms, but it was just so hard for me to get myself --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out on a regular basis. 
R:  Yes.  
L:  Um, [MN] would -- wouldn't you know, I signed up for a temp, you know, a temporary two week thing, just when for most of those two weeks nobody could drive anywhere because of the snow and ice. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no, would they not renew it?
L:  Well, it was -- it was free.  For temporary -- but, I mean, I wouldn't -- I was trying to see if I would actually do it. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And then I said, "I don't know if I will". 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, just because it's so hard to get up -- first you have to get up and you have to carve a good portion of the time out, the time to get there, the time to do it, the time to clean up afterwards and come back. 
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  That's a big hunk of time.
R:  Well, that's why I bought the exercise videos thinking that, um, you know, I would do it at home.  And I just don't.  I don't -- they -- they look at me every day and I still don't do 'em. 
L:  Right.  Well, I do have one, um, recommendation.  I never did it, but I saw other people doing it.  If you have a pool, a community pu- -- pool, I've seen people doing swim classes with their kids, where their kids lean how to swim and they do -- and it seems to be really a lot of fun for the parents and the kids and they pa- -- you know, some [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Oh, that -- well, I tried water aerobics one time. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that was really, it was fun.  But, you know, I got out of that too, so ...
L:  Yeah, I like -- I like it, but we don't have a -- access to a --
R:  To a pool. 
L:  -- of our own. I mean we're in a community that doesn't have one.  But, um, and then you have to get there.  I just thought it was something to do with your kid.  
R:  Right.
L:  Since I was [inaudible] if I'm doing something -- the key for me is if somebody else is doing it with me, I'll do it. 
R:  Exactly.
L:  It's so hard to, um, to -- to get -- to get myself to do it by myself. 
R:  I- -- you need that motivation. 
L:  Right.  So I was thinking, if you signed up with your kid, looks like a blast.  I mean, it's not the best of things but at least gets you in the water and then --
R:  It would be something.  
L:  -- it would get you inspired to kinda maybe, I mean -- but I don't know, that's just y- -- something to do with your kid.  'Cause then you at least have company and you're -- and it's good for the kid too and, um, I don't know, um, our kid, I mean, my son is extremely good at -- at -- at -- athletic things, but he doesn't like doing them.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- very much.  I mean, we -- we -- we ran him through all the swim classes and he learnt to swim, but he prefers just to play in the water. 
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- if you think, but, um, it's, um, you know, he, I mean, I -- it's very important.  
R:  The -- will your husband exercise with you?
L:  Well, he's -- see, I wanted to get a, um, elliptical, but he thought they were really boring.  But then, um, he had somebody recommend the, ah, the recumbent bike and he tried it and he liked it, so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's --
R:  Is the +recumbent bike the one that you sit down on?
L:  Yeah, but it's --
R:  But it --
L:  -- it's a piece of exercise equipment but it's a recumbent bike excercise equipment.  So it's like you're -- you're -- you're not leaning forward, you're leaning backwards and --
R:  Oh, okay, so it got the chair on it?
L:  Yeah, it's like a --
R:  Ba- --
L:  -- you're sitting in a chair --  
R:  Right --
L:  -- and paddling.
R:  -- instead of a little bike --
