L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Hi, my name's Annette.
L:  [NOISE] My name's Helena, what's yours?
R:  Annette.
L:  Annette?  Nice to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you --
L:  Um, I didn't really catch the topic.  I know they said something about September eleventh, but what was the other stuff?
R:  It was, "What changes, if any, have you made in your life since the attack on September eleventh?"
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, well you -- I don't know.  I haven't really made any, um --
R:  Um, that's what I was trying to think of.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I don't think I really made any.  I notice --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  -- probably when I went tra- -- when I travelled after that date I probably was more observant.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, or probably more worried than anything, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not -- not a whole lot.  I don't -- I don't think I have made any changes.  Um --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, ah -- well, it's probably going to be a short conversation. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, [LAUGH] and we still got to do other calls. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I, um -- I don't know, like it -- it made me -- might have changed my mindset a little bit, but I mean I'm kinda one of those people that I just feel like if something's going to happen to me it's gonna happen, and there's not a whole lot, like, I couldn't really prevent a terrorist attack on myself, you know, or --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] -- if I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, like, I don't think there's really many measures you can take.  You know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.  Well, I guess --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- one way it did -- I did get affected by it was that since the stock market plummeted pretty much --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was able to invest a little bit more than I would have been able to.  So --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- that's one way it changed.
L:  Definitely.
R:  But, um, that's about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, also -- okay well, my dad's stock went down and he doesn't want to retire now until it comes back up.  So that's [LAUGH] changed.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  So, um, mm.
L:  [COUGH] And I know [NOISE] trying to think if, like, any -- if, like, big affects that it actually had on -- I'm from West Virginia and, um -- well, actually when I -- whenever it happened I was working at Disneyworld and, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it was kinda crazy because, like, they shut down the park that day and then ever since -- I'd say until, like, Thanksgiving, Christmas time, like, the park was [inaudible] dead and I worked at the Magic Kingdom which was like, you know, always had, like, [inaudible] thousands and thousands of people.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean that was kinda crazy.  So that was, like, definitely so- -- a difference that I saw, you know, like, a huge impact and then of course they laid off people, you know, and -- and took a lot of people to part time and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was weird --
R:  Wow, that must have been a --
L:  -- because that park -- what's that?
R:  That must have been hard on some people. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it definitely was.  But, um -- [MN]
R:  Yeah, that is strange for something -- for it to affect it to that degree, you know?  You know what I mean?  That [inaudible] you know, is almost [NOISE] empty.
L:  Yeah.  Sorry I wasn't in the ideal situ- -- like, position to, like [LAUGH] talk on the phone so I'm trying to get -- 'cause I'm like in the car with people and I'm just trying to get 'em to shut up.  Now I'm in a parking lot.
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean [LAUGH] um --
L:  Sometimes I get like a -- it seems like I always get the call like the worst time. [LAUGH]
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just always, like, in the middle of something, but I'd like already, um, rejected it a couple of times so I was like, "Oh, better take this call". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know the last time --
L:  So where -- now, where do you live?
R:  In Tucson, Arizona. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so it was --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- oh, go ahead.
L:  No, go ahead.
R:  Oh, I was just going to say when it happened, you know, it's -- 'cause I've gone to New York quite a few times, so I know how big those buildings are.  And when I -- people here, a lot of them have [NOISE]  -- well, a lot of the one's that I -- that I'm around haven't been to New York so when they heard about it they didn't know how many people those buildings can hold, so they didn't -- you know, it wasn't 'til they started saying how big those buildings were and how many people were in there that they started realising how bad that could be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I thought that was kinda interesting.  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And just the whole -- I kind of -- I missed, you know, I'm -- I feel sorry for the people that were in there and the families that have to go through that.  And my -- my husband's actually from New York so he had a -- he had a few friends, one of 'em did die.
L:  Oh.
R:  She -- she was missing and they never found her, so she died in there.  But, um --
L:  See that's what's terrible is when they never find someone, you know, and, I mean -- I mean you can kind of make your own -- draw your own conclusions about what happened, but it's just -- I mean I think that would just leave like a -- a gaping hole, you know?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even more so.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well I just --
L:  Like, um --
R:  -- I just think -- I think it changed New York for me anyways.  You know, the whole look of it, the whole -- not so much the feel, but definitely the look.  It's kind of bad.  But I guess --
L:  I actually went to --
R:  -- they're rebuilding.
L:  -- ground zero, and I was kind of, like, shocked that -- well, I don't know if you've been there recently, but they don't have like really a real monument.  They just have that cross, you know, that they made out of a crossbeam?
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And then they --
R:  No, I haven't been there.
L:  Yeah, there's nothing --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- like, and there's just a huge fence around it.  You can't even -- like there are a few things, like, you know, pictures of what it did look like and, you know, like, there's a [inaudible] memorial, like, with all the names on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, kind of -- kinda like the -- like a veterans memorial like in DC --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that kind of thing.  Like the wall --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it's just like you can't take any -- I mean, I don't know that it really shouldn't matter [LAUGH] but I was just surprised that, you know, they didn't make it, like, more accessible.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But I guess they're trying to rebuild it, 'cause that's what it looked like.  There were construction crews and stuff like that.
R:  Mm.  So are they rebuilding right where they used to be?  Right on top of where they used to be?
L:  Well, it kind of looked like to me it -- well, all they had there, they didn't have any, like, actual structure up or anything, but it looked like they were working on the, um, like the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the ground.  They had it all, like -- it was kinda like a road.  I -- I thought they were going to make that, like, whole thing a memorial, but --
R:  Yeah, that's what I was expecting too.
L:  So they probably -- I mean, maybe that's what they're working on, you know?  Maybe they're thinking about making it like a little [inaudible] or something, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't -- were you there -- have you been there since?
R:  No, I haven't.  I've had friends that have gone there but I haven't been there.
L:  And they also have like a -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a little painting on the -- on the other building.  You know how a couple of the other buildings, the structure was, you know, like, half full.  Well, they've had to shut down the buildings 'cause, you know, some of them were --
R:  Yeah, they were less damaged.
L:  -- a little bit damaged.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But -- and they put some kind of -- it said something like, "United we stand" and it -- it was a -- like a kind of a --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- little poem.  It was neat.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it was kind of inspiring, but --
R:  [NOISE] Did it still [NOISE], um -- di- -- was it okay, like the air quality and stuff?  Is it okay by the time you went there, or was there --
L:  Yeah, I just went --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, three months ago --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  --  so -- maybe not that long ago.  So, yeah, it was just -- it was fine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- no, there was definitely like an eerie feeling, you [LAUGH] know, like after seeing all the stuff they splattered all over the media, you know, and then --
R:  Yeah, no kidding. [NOISE]
L:  That's ridiculous.  I think the media's just going to like outlandish --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know?  They have no respect any more --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- it's disgusting.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's true.  I know some of the things I saw on a few of those other, um, programmes were just -- you know, they didn't ne- -- they don't need to show that.  So --
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  And I guess another way it did change my life is I work for the Government, so we had a lot of extra protect- -- you know, a lot of extra security and had to go through a lot of different things just to get into our offices.  It -- so that changed, and even now once in a while when -- especially living next to a base --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause, um, Davis Monson[?] is over here in Tucson.
L:  Oh.
R:  The -- the airforce base.  So, even now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when they're put on high --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- alert then the Government's [NOISE] put on high alert over here where I [NOISE] work downtown, and then we have to go through security then too.  So in that way it has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- changed it.  Oh, and also the travelling, it takes a lot longer, you know?  Now you got to get there three hours in -- ahead of time.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, that's true.  Yeah.
R:  Um, that's changed that.
L:  [NOISE] All those high secur- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words]
R:  I guess -- so, I'm going to Disneyworld in August and I guess now since that's happened 'cause you never -- I never really thought United States would be able to get hit that hard.  You know, and now that it's happened it kinda makes you think twice when you go -- especially to a pub- -- such a public place like that, you know, that things could happen to you, and I think a lot of Americans didn't think we were that vulnerable.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  And there's -- but now even -- like I kind of feel a little bit more safer, you know, just --
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] -- I mean since that happened because, I don't know, it's like they're prepared almost in a way, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Even though they probably could never be that -- enough -- prepared enough to actually stop something catastrophic or, you know, but --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] -- I don't know, I guess I feel like their -- their almo- -- a higher alert, you know?  Whereas, um --
R:  Yeah, and now they're more observant.  They think about it more than probably before this happened.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause we have -- I mean, this country, like, thinks they're kind of -- I think the high officials think they're untouchable [inaudible], you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Seeing as we're like this super power [LAUGH] of the world, and --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] -- now it's kind of -- maybe it's brought 'em down a level, you know, like -- not that I'm saying it's a positive thing, but -- [LAUGH]
R:  No, I understand what you're saying --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- definitely.  That's what -- some people are saying, "Well how could they -- how could they do that to us and --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "That's not -- we always want to help people [NOISE] as a --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "United States, they always want to help people" and that's a -- I would ask them if they -- yeah, but do they ask for the help or is it --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- that we're forcing stuff on these people that they don't want it?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so I -- I think it's [inaudible]
L:  [NOISE] They see it more as like an interference and just a --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] -- you know, an attack on the way they live their lives and -- I mean, sometimes, you know, of course some people are just starving and they don't really care where --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's true.  So, well, you live in Virginia you said?
