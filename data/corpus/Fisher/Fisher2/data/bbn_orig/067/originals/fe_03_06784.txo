L:  Hi, my name is Debra.
R:  Hi, my name is Michael.  Nice to meet you, Debra.
L:  You too.
R:  [SIGH] So, what, if any, changes have, uh, have you made since September eleventh?
L:  Actually, wonder if I said, "None".
R:  Really --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- nothing at all?
L:  Not really.
R:  Which portion of the country do you live in?
L:  I'm in California.
R:  Yeah, that would probably -- I guess --
L:  You know, first I should ask you, did you lose anyone in September eleventh, because if you did, it would be --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- rather callous of me --
R:  No, no, no, absolutely not.  Um, no, I -- I have friends who did, but, uh, myself or my family, no.  Um, I actually live in New York City so it kind of affected --
L:  Okay. [MN]
R:  -- me a little bit -- a little bit more on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a personal level and -- and a -- much more local than, um, I guess, most -- I won't say most people, but some people, some people that weren't necessarily within, you know, close vicinity of -- of -- of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the, uh -- of the attack, don't have -- I guess, we all saw the news, but they don't really have a full understanding of what it's like to stand there and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- look and see what's ha- -- what happened afterwards. [MN] Even just the -- you know, not the emotional distress or the, um, psychological changes that people went through, but just the physical, you know --
L:  Mhm. 
R:  -- you walking -- you walk down, um, [MN] towards ground zero and it's just -- there's this eerie -- I won't say silence -- but things are deadened down --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that way, it's not the city that it once was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's taken -- it's taken a lot of New Yorkers a long time to get back into -- I won't say their normal routine, but into feeling any sort of, uh, you know, real joy or anything out of anything, because every time you turn around, there's one, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one or multiple things that remind you of what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- happened here. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just a very, you know, obviously, it's a very terrible thing that happened. [SIGH] But, uh, no, no one -- no one -- I should ask you the same, I mean, do you know anyone that -- that -- or know any- --
L:  Not really, we had friends in New York City, but once we accounted for all of them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and then I have a brother and a sister in law who work in Washington DC --
R:  Exactly, so --
L:  -- and once we acc- -- they were sent home, and once we accounted for them, then, you know, it's --
R:  It's like a sigh of relief, I can -- can end and that's -- that in no way diminishes the grief --
L:  No.
R:  -- that other people are going through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just your own --
L:  No.
R:  -- personal, you know, when it's your family, it's -- it's a -- it's an entirely different matter and, um --
L:  And when you think of the five thousand people and the enormity of it and then that they all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had families and they all had children and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it just multiples -- multiplies on and on and on.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's -- it's, uh, it's a very depressing thing, especially here.  Uh, there are still, you know, um, things that you can't do as a re- -- you know, certain -- certain subways don't go to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to certain places any more, they had to reroute them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and any time that you have to, uh, observe one of those characteristics, I should say, of the -- of the aftermath, it's a very stark reminder of what happened and I think that's, in some ways, a good thing, people --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- people don't forget, but, um [MN] -- as far as changes that I went through, obviously there were some, uh, personal choice changes like, you know, going to major events, always --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- think twice now, you know, if you're going to a particular sporting event or a concert or something like that where there's going to be a large amount of people, it sort of lingers in the back of my mind, especially when they start raising the, you know, the security level --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of our homeland security.  You know, that this would be -- and I -- I always played terrible games with my mind, like, I'm like, "This would be a -- a, you know, a -- a terrible --" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- but a terrific --" 
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- target --" 
L:  I understand [LAUGH]
R:  "-- you know, for people --" 
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- for people to attack", I'm like, "There's --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this mob of people who're like, um ..." -- we had several museums or exhibits open since then and, uh, you know, I'm like, "These are, you know, typically, the more educated people --" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- you know, of the city" and I'm like, you know, "The amount of raw intelligence and -- and workload factor that they could wipe out if they were to, you know, attack this particular place at this particular time is -- would just be devastating".  So, I always think twice now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and of course, [MN] um, I do the same for my girlfriend and her son, you know, any time he wants to go anywhere --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I, you know, he's only -- he was el- eleven when the attack happened so he's -- I think he's, now what, almost thirteen now, so he's, you know, a teenager and wants to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to go out and do things and it's, like, it's very difficult to say, "No" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but, uh, um -- not right now, thank you -- sorry [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- somebody was knocking at my door.  Um, [MN] it's a -- it's a very -- it's a very difficult thing to tell him, you know, you know, "I would rather you not --" 
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- uh, participate in a particular event that would leave you in even the remotest chance, you know..."  You have to -- I guess, as a parent, she has to make those sort of judgement calls --"
L:  Sure.
R:  -- I mean, that she has, in my opinion -- I'd, you know -- I'm -- not that I'm any expert on the matter, but certainly, you know, how I feel about things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, how was it -- did you watch any of it unfold?
L:  I did, but I didn't watch it all the time, it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- was just too much to watch --
R:  It is.
L:  -- I could -- you can't, you just can't watch it over.
R:  It is.  Um --
L:  It's too horrible.
R:  [COUGH] -- the problem with New Yorker's are is they're -- they're absolutely terrible rubber neckers and, um --
L:  Well, everybody is, but, you know ...
R:  -- and but, probably for the first day we were all glued to the sets because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mostly, just to find out what was -- what was going on -- what exactly happened, you know, when something that catastrophic happens in your own city, it's very --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's very unsettling, um, you know, there was a brief portion of the time the building I was in that, you know -- and I'm -- I should say, I'm in New York City, but I'm way, way, way up on the west side --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I'm not anywhere near, you know, the -- I don't know if you are familiar with Manhattan [inaudible], I'm not anywhere --
L:  I became a little --
R:  -- near th- --
L:  -- familiar --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- afterwards --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I got out a map. [MN]
R:  Exactly.  So, I'm way d- -- I mean, I'm way up on the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the top, and they're way d- -- you know, the attack site was way down on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the very end of the peninsula. [SIGH] So, um, you know, there was a time that we had to go into the basement and, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it -- it was, uh, -- it was a -- it was a -- a frightening affair, I mean, anybody that doesn't say that is, of course, kidding themselves, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, it's -- it's incredibly intimidating.  And I think -- I think, in general, what's happened is people have become a lot more globally aware.  Not only, obviously, of themselves as Americans, but as a -- sort of this global village where there are a lot of people that don't necessarily either enjoy the same ideals or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the same freedoms as us and there is a lot of animosity that we --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- don't -- either we don't see or we don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- choose to see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And t- -- you know, as a -- as a result, people, I think, after the attack, are much more [LIPSMACK] -- much more observant of things like that.  They, um, [LIPSMACK] they won't invite those kinds of things on themselves, by going pa- -- to particular places or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, tra- -- obviously travel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the travel industry has suffered a great deal, but, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have several friends who did not make trips that they intended to make well into a year after -- after --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the incident because they just don't feel like, as an American, they feel safe going --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to another country now.  E- e- even if it's, you know, a pa- particularly --
L:  The terrorist attack --
R:  -- friendly country, just because of all the terrorism worldwide now, it's a very --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's a very unsettling thing.
L:  Well, you mentioned the security and it's funny, because my mother works at Disneyland --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you can imagine that could be, um --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- uh, they could attack there too and the security they -- the employees have to go through now --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- just to get in, you know, they're like, their trunks are searched in the parking lot and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- nobody goes in or out unless you know exactly who they are --
R:  And see, we w- -- we -- we all n- -- we all took advantage of -- of that well before the attack, we never had to endure something like that --
L:  No.
R:  -- because there never a --
L:  No.
R:  -- threat.
L:  No.
R:  [SIGH] You know, even when we had, uh, terroristic attacks, you know, um, the Oklahoma City bombing, even the, uh, the World Trade Center bombing years ago, uh, it -- security is a little bit heightened after, but, uh --
L:  They didn't really wake us up, did they?
R:  Not, yeah -- not -- not to this level --
L:  No.
R:  -- not to the, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the level at now which we live and probably will live for some time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, we go down to, uh, any -- any major subway station now and there's [LIPSMACK] national guardsmen within six [inaudible] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that's, um, something that I never thought I would see on -- you know, you see it on the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- news on -- in a -- in a foreign country where soldiers are marching around carrying guns and I'm like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "I could never see that happening here in our country" but [MN] and -- and -- and this is, of course, you know, and not as a -- as an internal thing, this is a protecting you from an external thing, [NOISE] but, even so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just very, um, -- it's very strange to see things like that and, of course, yeah, there's a lot more security that we have to go through everywhere, you know, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't known if you've flown since then, um, --
L:  [LAUGH] I've been afra- -- no, I haven't been afraid of the planes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I've been afraid of the airports. [LAUGH]
R:  It's, um, it's a --
L:  I just dread --
