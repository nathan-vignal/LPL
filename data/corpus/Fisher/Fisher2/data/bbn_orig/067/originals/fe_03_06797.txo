L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  My -- my name is Danni.
R:  I'm Ron.
L:  Hi, Ron.
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  Uh, yeah, [SIGH] so, what do you think?
R:  About these sports people?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, [SIGH] as far as striking's concerned?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you know, [MN] it is a job, okay, like other jobs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, I suppose that, um, you know, it's a professional, you know, job so therefore, uh, supposedly if other individuals have rights to strike, then I can't see why these sports people --
L:  Cannot strike.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I agree, I -- I think that, I don't know, I think you sh- -- today everything has developed so much, to the point where if you don't make your own income, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you don't think of a way of making your own income --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're kind of going to end up on the poor side, so, uh, like, if you have a talent, you know, like, running or some- -- I don't know, something and --
R:  Yeah. [SIGH]
L:  -- you don't use it, or you use it, you might --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, I don't -- I'm for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I really am.
R:  Uh-huh.  I can see it.
L:  Yeah.  What else do you [LAUGH] think?
R:  About this strike?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sports individuals going on strike?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, well, is it -- the question revolves round money too, right?  In other words, do they make too much money?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Correct?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's the topic as well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, [MN] you know --
L:  Do you think it's ridiculous that they make so much money or ...?
R:  Well, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] you know, let's say, for example, that the New York Mets, just hypothetically --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they -- they play somewhere, okay?
L:  All right.
R:  Whether at home or, let's say, for example, Boston, Mass.
L:  All right.
R:  You know, how many people are going to, you know, see these people, you know, I mean, there's, uh, viewer, TV, uh, situation going on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there's a -- there's people who actually go to these particular games --
L:  Yeah.
R: -- so, what I'm getting at is, uh, if there's a lot of people, all right, that are involved, you know, interested --
L:  In the sport?
R:  Well, in that particular -- I just gave an example, like the New York Mets.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, let's say, for example, that ten thousand people show up in Boston's arena.
L:  All right.
R:  Uh, they pay, hypothetically, you know, eight dollars -- ten dollars a ticket, say, for example --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- now, that's, uh, [LIPSMACK] a hundred thousand dollars --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] and, um, [MN] you know, like, uh, [MN] that's from some of that money is obviously going to go to the ball players --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and also the viewing audience.  In other words, let's give an example, that, for example, a Mazer[?] is being shown on TV, in regards to the sports events, in other words Mazer helped put on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sponsored the sports event, so therefore, uh, the viewers, okay, in other words, they do tabulations of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- viewers, so how many other -- how many people are watching this particular game and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the Mazer Corporation's vehicles, uh, that are, uh, being displayed, okay?  So, what I'm getting at is, if it's a large viewer base and we already said that there was, uh, uh, I think ten thousand people --
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  -- that appeared in that particular arena --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and also, uh, there's a large viewer base because of the tabulation that the network did and Mazer perhaps did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then, you know, it's something that -- it's f- -- you know, it's something that, uh, would warrant, you know, making some serious cash --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because a lot of individuals have invested either their time and money or their home or their viewing, you know, this particular thing. [MN] They may go out and buy a Mazer, you know --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- so, therefore, I -- I can see where they would make a considerable amount of money [SIGH] because of the fact that, if there's a lot of people who are interested in this, and show up for these games and view these, uh, things on TV, uh, then, why wouldn't they, uh, make a serious amount of cash?  Can you see that?
L:  Uh, it makes sense.  But do you think -- do you think it -- it would then improve, you know, like, I don't know, you know how sports -- everything goes to another level, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, yeah, development, you have to be able to improve.  Do you [SIGH] they'll be getting more money in the future and then, do you think sports will just take on another level as well and -- and hence --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they'll be getting more money and the strikes will be bigger as well if they did go on strikes?
R:  Well, the thing of is -- I must say this, I am, myself, am not really interested in -- in sports that much, okay?
L:  Yeah?
R:  I don't go to these events and I don't watch TV --
L:  Oh, I love sport, why not?
R:  -- that often, okay?  But, on saying that, society des- -- you know, deserves, [MN] um, uh, the sports, I mean, it's part of, you know, being alive, right?
L:  Yeah, I think it's one of the things that define humanity, I think, you know, it's --
R:  Well, you know, I -- I don't say I don't care for any sport, I mean, I do care for some sports and, uh --
L:  What's your favorite sport?
R:  Well, I l- -- I like tennis, I don't mi- -- I like watching tennis --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and --
L:  Why do you like tennis so much? 
R:  Pardon?
L:  Why do like tennis?
R:  I don't know, it's just, uh, seems, uh, kind of appealing, sometimes I can sit there and watch a game, [SIGH] um, but, uh, as far as, like the, you know, these, um, athletes are c- -- you know, uh, go on strike and also, uh, [MN] how much money they make, what I'm trying to say is that there's nothing wrong with a society that has sports.
L:  Yeah, I agree on that.  I think it's, yeah -- but sometimes, don't you know, you -- you see a kid looking up to them, you know, and everything, and all they s- -- you know, like what they -- what is it that sports people -- like, one of our kids had, uh -- had sports people as role models and what, uh -- these sports people have, um -- what they do in their lives, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the money that they earn, so much money, you see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know, I, um, I don't know, I think -- I like that they get so much money and I -- I can appreciate that, if I was in sport, I would like to make as much money, but I think sometimes, uh, we put so much -- we put so much into sports that, I don't know, [MN] where you don't give --
R:  Well, let me s- -- let me say this -- let me say this and that is that, like I said earlier, that s- -- you know, sports are [MN] -- it's a position, you know, like a job --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and what I'm getting at is, is that every time baseball players go out on the field, every time football players go out on the field, every time any -- even -- we're talking about even tennis players --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [MN] any time any individuals go out [MN] they're taking a chance because, [MN] you don't know if they're going to break a leg, if they're going to get a shoulder, uh, dislocated, [MN] uh, they could get injured in a lot different ways by playing these sports --
L:  Yeah, well, isn't it --
R:  Correct?
L:  -- the same with work, though?
R:  Pardon?
L:  I know, I know you wa- walking to work, I don't know, you can get into an accident --
R:  No, but I'm just --
L:  -- a similar accident.
R:  -- saying that when they do, you know, participate in these sports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're taking a chance on their wellbeing.
L:  That's right, that's true.
R:  And so, therefore, it adds, in my opinion, to the value of the -- of the game [MN] and to their regard --
L:  You don't think it adds to the value of the player instead of the value of the game?
R:  I'm saying that the value of the player [MN] and in regard to the striking and regard to the payment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're taking, uh, some serious risks, okay?  As we know, many baseball players and football players and so forth, basketball players, so forth, have been injured because it, you know -- it- it's a competition, it's a pretty serious matter --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, that adds to, you know, whether or not they should be able to strike, it adds to the payment they may receive because, um, you know, uh, you've seen, if you've watched sports -- you've watched sports, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm sure you've seen, uh, people who participate injured before --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- may have been taken off the field or, uh, you know, uh, who kno- -- you know, administ- -- health, uh -- medical people might have, uh --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- administered health, uh, care to them right on the field or taken them off or, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, you know, wouldn't you agree that that, uh, gives them some, uh, credibility when it comes to payment [SIGH] and also the ability to strike, because it is -- c- can be dangerous?
L:  No, I totally agree.  I just think sometimes we hold certain people in society too high than they should be, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I guess, like -- like in high school, I grew up being asked, you know in essays, uh, "Do you think sports should be a profession, or do you think it should just be, uh, an enjoyable sport?" and I'm like, you know, "I don't g- -- I don't know", but now I -- I apprec- -- I see both sides of it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I g- --
R:  Well, it is a profession, right? [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Today it is a profession where people make tons of money and I -- I totally appreciate that and I would do it too, but sometimes I just think that we should just learn to appreciate the sport instead of appreciating the person that's playing the sports so much as we do.
R:  Well, the thing is is that -- another thing too is that you've got to be adept, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, when you go out and you play, whether it's baseball, football, hockey, whatever sport it is, if you're not adept and you're not a good player, I -- I don't think you're going to make it too g- -- you know, it's not going to work out for you --
L:  I --
R:  -- you gotta be a good player, you gotta really put forth a lot of good work to get your, uh, team, you know --
L:  Okay, let's say -- let's say --
R:  I h- --
