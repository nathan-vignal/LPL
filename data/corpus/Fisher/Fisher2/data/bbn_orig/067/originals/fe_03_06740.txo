L:  [SIGH] 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I was waiting for a tone. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My name is Rhoda.
R:  [SIGH] I'm Alita.
L:  Hi, Alita.
R:  Mm, hi.
L:  So --
R:  [SIGH] Um --
L:  -- this is a good topic.
R:  Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I don't do as much as I should right now, [MN] um, [SIGH] my husband is out of state right now, and I usually want to exercise -- exercise with him, he has --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] a four way bypass last February, so we have kind of gotten in the habit of, [SIGH] um, doing some, [SIGH] um, walking every --every day for [MN] -- for possibly about half an hour to an hour when he's home, [SIGH] and changed our eating habits --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- and trying to, you know, impr- to -- to live his -- you know, h- with his new diet restrictions and all that kind of stuff. [SIGH] Good stuff.
L:  What was it that happened last February that caused you start this?
R:  [SIGH] He had a four way bypass.
L:  Oh, boy.  Well, yeah --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- so, [SIGH] um, now, even though he's out of state, is he exercising out of state, does he tell you?
R:  [SIGH] He is still exercising r- really good, I understand.  I'm not, [SIGH] as good without -- without my partner. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But he, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] is [SIGH] with some friends right now in another state looking for work and [SIGH] he gets up a- every morning and does his, [SIGH] um, routine around that little -- [MN] the little town where they live [SIGH] and -- [MN] before he goes looking for work.  And, um, [SIGH] we ho- [MN] we hope to relocate back to -- um, actually, he's in North Carolina, [SIGH] and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we hope to [MN] locate back to N- to North Carolina, [SIGH] and then we'll get into our walking routine and our friends are really good, um, square dancers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so they -- they have told us [SIGH] one requirement is that we learn to square dance which --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- of course will be, [LAUGH] you know, 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] some --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- good exercises for [MN] -- for us.
L:  Easy and wonderful.  What a nice thing to do with friends.
R:  Mhm. [SIGH] 
L:  Well, so, um, [LIPSMACK] now, do you feel unsafe walking without your partner?
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] No, I just, um, [NOISE] need that little extra push. [SIGH] My, um -- [LIPSMACK] my work schedule is so hectic and [SIGH] I walk -- I walk enormous amount at work, and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so I just -- [MN] when I get home I'm just lazy. [LAUGH] 
L:  It sounded like you said you walk an enormous amount at work?
R:  Yes, [SIGH] I'm a floor supervisor for a ladies' clothing store [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so of course I'm on my feet walking around the store all day, so [SIGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a little --
L:  Yeah, but that's not real aerobics because you're not really --
R:  No, it's not --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and [MN] [LAUGH] I need to get back into it. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, dear. [SIGH] 
R:  Ding too many other things. 
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [SIGH] And you?
L:  Well, that's the one area -- well, I'm not good at housekeeping either, those are the two [LAUGH] areas --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm really weak at. [SIGH] I'm an excellent sitter.  I love to sit, I'm an audience for as much as whatever I can watch.  I'm a couch potato.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and so I've even gotten, um, the tapes on, like, uh, oxygenation, deep breathing, that's supposed to burn up calories if you do it right, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of course I didn't -- I didn't really follow through on that, [SIGH] and, um, [SIGH] oh, my goodness.  So, I do love to walk, um, but it is a matter of making the time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] I discovered, in fact, um, when I was working -- I retired, but when I was working regularly, I was known as the walker reader, because I discovered I could read a book and walk at the same time.
R:  [SIGH] Oh. [LAUGH] 
L:  I love to read.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I would just have this, like, built in radar, so when I approached a telephone pole or something I might bump into I [SIGH] I could feel it --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and look up and avoid it.
R:  [SIGH] That must be what my son does.  My son is --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [SIGH] an avid reader and he -- he will do exactly like you were saying, he will walk down the street with a book in his face, and like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "How can you see where you're [LAUGH] --"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- you're g-" [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, um [LIPSMACK] -- so if I just made the time to go to, like, a, uh, walk path at a football field or something where people walk, [SIGH] I could just -- it's like, have book, will walk, will walk.  For miles and miles I could walk as long as I'm reading my book.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess that's same as people listen to hear- to their headsets, they don't get bored [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if they're listening to something. [SIGH] But, um [LIPSMACK] -- but I don't do that. [SIGH] And I have a swimming pool and last summer I guess I tried to get in the habit of using my pool, but the kids all use it, little kids and stuff and it's hard to -- [SIGH] to do that too. [LIPSMACK] Um, I thought of a treadmill, because I do love to watch TV, so if I had something I could just be doing while I'm watching my TV, that would be good, except I like to lie down [LAUGH] while I'm watching --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] my TV. [SIGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Gee.
L:  Oh, and using weights, now, when you walk do you use arm weights at all?
R:  [SIGH] No, um, [LIPSMACK] he, um [NOISE] -- I didn't really get int- [SIGH] to the weights, but he had, um, [LIPSMACK] oh. I guess, some rehab [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- w- [SIGH] when he was laid off work there, and they -- they did the -- the weights, and they have a little rowing machine [SIGH] and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, [SIGH] a bicycle there I think, [MN] and of course he did -- he did all that, and, um, [SIGH] we're thinking of maybe joining, [SIGH] um, the Y --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and taking advantage of their, um -- their, um, [LIPSMACK] weight room and all that when [SIGH] we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we kinda get settled again and [SIGH] 'cause that's really g- [SIGH] that's really good to build up your strength and to [MN] condition everything to, so  [NOISE] [SIGH] 
L:  I really believe that some day I'm going to get into it.  I'm not quite ready [SIGH] yet.  Um, I do eat healthily [LIPSMACK] and --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I know that that's the one thing that's lacking in terms of really boosting up the metabolism and toning up my body.
R:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Well, we always said we were going to get in -- uh, we were going to get into some kind of exercise routine or maybe [SIGH] ride bikes or [SIGH] -- or something [SIGH] but, you know, we [SIGH] -- we kind of just set it aside and then [SIGH] l- last February we thought he -- [SIGH] we actually thought he had had a -- just little bit of an asthma because [SIGH] he's been diagnosed with asthma before and he --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- was out of his inhaler [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so we said, "You got to go get an inhaler" and --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- he went to the doctor and the doctor said, [SIGH] "That's not what it is" and we went, "What do you mean that's not what it is?" [SIGH] And he said, "Yeah, I think it's his heart".  So they sent him to another doctor [SIGH] and he put him on the s- the treadmill and that was it.  I mean, immediately he knew it was the heart so he just --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- took him over. [SIGH] He was going to just do the balloon thing [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, [SIGH] went in there to -- to originally do that and found out --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- he was so far blocked [SIGH] that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- he had ninety percent blockage in one of his, um --
L:  Mm, mm, mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] arteries and there was just [MN] -- there was just no way.
L:  Hm.
R:  [SIGH] You know, and so, when you get a wakeup call that strong [LAUGH] you [LAUGH] [SIGH] --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- it has a tendency to get a hold over you and go, "Mm, uh, I think I'd better change". [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes. [SIGH] Now, how about smoking?  Were neither of you smokers?
R:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] He had been a smoker, [SIGH] oh, twenty -- oh, what -- well, [SIGH] he had been a smoker a long, long time ago and woke up one night and coughed and hacked and [SIGH] -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- and spluttered and carried on [SIGH] and said, "I think I'm having a heart attack, and that's it, I'm never going to smoke another cigarette" and I thought, "Yeah, I've heard this [SIGH] --"
L:  Hm.
R:  "-- song and dance before". [SIGH] He -- he did that, um, and really did quit.  Two months after that [SIGH] I found out I was pregnant.  Our son is --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [SIGH] is nineteen years old now, and he's never touched another cigarette.
L:  [SIGH] You're kidding.  You guys really have been married over twenty years?
R:  We've been married twenty eight years.
L:  Oh, my gosh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you sound so young.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And you probably are still young, that's great.
R:  [MN] Yeah. [SIGH] 
L:  [SIGH] Wow.
R:  Yeah, it's been [MN] good time --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's been -- you know, we've had our ups and downs but, [SIGH] you know, what marriage doesn't and we -- [MN] we --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- get along, so [SIGH] yeah, we've, [MN] um [LIPSMACK] -- w- we got married t- in seventy five on Valentine's Day. [SIGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Our son was born nine -- what --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- nine years [SIGH] almost to the day after we got married.  He was born on the seventh of February and so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you know --
L:  That was a long time to go --
