L:  [LIPSMACK] Hello?
R:  Hello.  My name is Fr- --
L:  Hi.
R:  Mhm, Frances B Springer.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Oh, hi.  How are you?
R:  Fine.
L:  Hold on, let me readjust my headset.  Hold on please. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, how are you today?
R:  Fine.  How are you doing?
L:  I'm doing great.
R:  That's good.
L:  My name's Taya.
R:  Huh?
L:  My name is Taya. [NOISE]
R:  And my name is Frances Springer.
L:  [MN] Hi.  I'm in Washington DC, where are you?
R:  I'm in Durham, North Carolina.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.  [SIGH] Ah, well see, what changes in your life have you made since September eleventh?
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I send up more prayers for one thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this thinking that you have to do, you know, daily --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is you go about your daily tasks and you try to do everything right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Try to help somebody else while you got a chance 'cause you'll --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- never know --
L:  You're right about that.
R:  -- when so- -- when something's going to happen.
L:  You're right about that.  When the least you expect it.
R:  Uh-huh.  That -- that's right.
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- because you -- you know, our days are not -- not promised.
L:  That's true.
R:  But -- but the thing about it, ah, we have to live like that.  And I think before the Sept- -- before the September the eleventh I think people was living -- and I've also been reading that +there haven't been as many divorces.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Really?
R:  Uh-huh, I read it --
L:  I know there was --
R:  -- in the paper.
L:  -- a boom in marriages right after, um --
R:  Yeah, and it's [several inaudible words].
L:  -- but I didn't know about the divorces.
R:  Yeah, they ha- -- there's been less divorces.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh really?
R:  And -- and there's been more marriages.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And it says -- and they say there's been a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, marriage counselling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it -- it's -- it's for both, you know, husband and wife.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause they're -- sometimes they have it just for the wife and then the husband.  Usually they bring 'em together later on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but that ha- -- that has helped some.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  But then the- they're trying now to get into the law that the -- you know, if you go to a lawyer for divorce they want that lawyer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to seek counselling for them before they divorce.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.
R:  They are trying to get that into law now when -- when you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go there --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.
R:  -- and ask for a divorce.  Seem like they're trying to give people more of a chance other than --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [inaudible], "Well, if I don't want him I could also get somebody else, I don't want him".  But see --
L:  Right, take it --
R:  -- but see --
L:  -- a little more seriously. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  But see, that's not good for children.
L:  Right.
R:  See, 'cause when you're divorced you're not only messing up yourself, you making it hard for the children.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And then they come up and then they need counselling.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's just -- it -- it's just skyrocketing.  It's just like you open up a keg of worms when you get a divorce with children.
L:  Right.
R:  Because they get mad with the parents, get mad with the stepfather or stepmother.  And if they got stepchildren, they're mad with each other.  They think they're, ah, plotting against each other, and it's not a thing but that man and wife want a divorce.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And a lot of times I ha- -- I have seen -- when I watch TV shows I have seen that the, ah -- the children -- divorce children, even their grades drop in school.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  And, um, they're not, like they're not able quite to get it together.  Their mind is on the -- the parent that left, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- I know, some of 'em do run away.
L:  Right.
R:  And some of --
L:  A lot of 'em do because you can't really -- your life changes in such a way that you're not old enough to understand --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- or to put it in perspective.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  And sometimes they know, but they don't know what to do.
L:  Right, they don't know what to do.
R:  Mhm.  'Cause these children come up now they know more than we ever do, but they just don't know how to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- put it together.
L:  Right.  Did you lose anyone in September eleventh?
R:  No, I didn't.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I sure didn't.  But I ha- -- I did have a cousin there.  I don't know whether they was affected or -- or not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, oh, in New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, since talking to him I don't think it has affected his -- he's in Rochester, New York.
L:  Okay.
R:  It might have been too far away but --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- even I don't care how far away you been, they -- they think about that September eleventh.  And -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and see, you don't -- you don't only cast your eyes on, ah, September el- eleventh in New York, you better start casting your eyes on things around you.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.
R:  'Cause you really -- you really -- you don't know where they are.
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, you definitely don't.
R:  [inaudible].  Well, look where those people came -- came from Florida --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- down.  And they're going --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to a pilot school.  They got in that way somewhere.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And then -- and then they took own United States airplane, own gasoline and everything --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and ran -- ran that plane.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- still I think United States still let 'em in.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm. [MN]
R:  And see if they would check their visas and passports and all that stuff like they supposed to, we wouldn't have had that much.  And right now we don't know who looking over our shoulders, they let so many in.  [LIPSMACK] So they have to put up security, not only where they're fighting, but here in the United States too.  [PAUSE] You still there?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I think -- 
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  I think it -- I think it changed a lot of people's lives, I really do.
L:  Think so too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it -- it -- it -- it had to. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's the kind of wake up call unfortunately that we needed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, obviously, you know, you hate the fact that lives were lost but I think that it made people, like you said, look at life a little bit differently.  Um --
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  -- you know, and --
R:  And it -- and it -- uh-huh.
L:  At least for a little while.
R:  And another thing -- go ahead.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And another thing, I go to church more often too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Definitely.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right, because if you don't -- if you don't have your faith then, you know, y- y- you don't have much to go on.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know?
R:  It gives you a little bit more strength to do what you're supposed to do --
L:  [inaudible] especially when you --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- you know, you're confused and you don't understand why things happen and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, how you can go on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you need faith.
R:  But, you know, when you -- when you go to that Bible study, you know, all that stuff is in there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All those, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My mother used to tell me when you -- what you see happening in the world is in that Bible somewhere.  That's what's going to happen, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's one reason why people shouldn't be too surprised if they read the Bible and go to church.  But if you don't, they're really surprised.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  They're highly surprised.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But you should -- you should carry yourself in a way that you shouldn't see -- be surprised when things like that happen.
L:  Right.
R:  Because -- because a lot of these things are predestinated.  God did that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.
R:  They don't understand that 'cause they didn't go nowhere to get that information.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And so --
L: I'm guessing you're right about that.
R:  -- I think -- I think they suffer more so than a person that's keeping up with it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because -- and the person that's keeping up with it, their ego is to go ahead and do things right and just don't be concerned and pray -- and pray --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all the time.  That's right.  But a lot of people don't even know to do that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] No, they don't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't. [MN]
R:  So, um, if --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yes, it -- it was a wake up call all right.
L:  It definitely was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] especially -- especially here in DC it's very -- the atmosphere and the karma has changed so much that, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I almost don't remember what it was like before September eleventh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, security everywhere is still heightened and --
R:  You know why -- you know why they don't know?  The -- the -- they were going so fast they didn't know it.  They didn't know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- what was happening.  Uh-huh.
L:  Exactly.  And things are just very different now, you know, you just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you have to think about things in a whole 'nother way.
R:  That's right.
L:  No matter what it is, everything from, you know, "Oh, I have to leave, you know, an hour early because I might get stopped at a check point" or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, um, "I have to make sure I carry my license at all times even if I'm not driving" --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- 'cause you never know.  You know, you want to make sure you stay in contact with your family and friends at all times and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- you know, make sure everybody has, you know, at least an emergency number to think about if something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- happens to anybody and --
R:  That's true.  And the- --
L:  The kind of things we don't --
R:  And then --
L:  -- normally think about.
R:  -- and then another thing, just stop getting in -- getting in that road rage folks do.
L:  Right, they do.
R:  Because sometime --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- I seen people leave, ah, you know in time and -- and, ah -- and up the road there's a wreck --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's cars always come to a complete stop.
L:  Right.
R:  And they -- and they get in a road rage --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- 'cause here where I am they ran around two or three cars on the median and tried to get up there, you know.  But the policeman stop 'em.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Really?
R:  I think -- they should think of that.  But they get so mad sometimes is why they start shooting.
L:  Right.
R:  And you just don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  You just don't know what it is.  Don't know what it's coming to.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, it's --
L:  Yes, it's scary.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  It's scary.
R:  [several inaudible words] he told me one day, he said you -- he said, "Remember now, the --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the person you're going to shoot is not worth the court procedure nor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- the bullets".
L:  Right.
R:  So you should think about that.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, there's a lot of people, when they ride they don't think about that.  But if somebody hit 'em, or a cra- --
L:  [LAUGH] Of course they don't.
R:  -- a crazy come down the road --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and just start shooting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that --
L:  They're so singly focussed on, you know, on driving and speeding and getting somewhere fast that they don't even --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- notice or care about anything else.
R:  That's true, that's true.  But, um, I'm hoping we don't have another one.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But I don't believe --
L:  No [MN] --
R:  -- I don't believe we're gonna have another one like that --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I believe it
