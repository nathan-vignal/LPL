L:  Hi there. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, this is Jasmine Shaffer.
L:  Hi there, I'm Bridget Redman calling from Michigan.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, I don't know much about this topic at all.  
R:  And what was it about?  Two baseball players who received all that money or ...?
L:  Right and the strikes by professional players, which I'm assuming is baseball. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]
R:  I am too.  I'm not a big sports fan --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that -- you know, that well.
L:  No and --
R:  You know, but anyway I don't think they should be getting all that money.
L:  [MN] You know, it does seem like an awful lot of money for playing a game.
R:  It sure does.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean it used to be a fun game, now it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They -- everybody played it just for fun, but now it seems like, "I'm only going to play if you give me so much money".
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, and it seems to over value the entertainment and make it really hard for I g- -- say, it's an awfully expensive endeavor for me to take my five year old and go to a baseball game. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, because by the time you get a pop or a hot dog --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and your tickets, y- you're talking let's go to a game, you gotta have at least fifty dollars --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in your pocket.
L:  And all because they have to pay those big salaries and boy [SIGH].  Eventually it's like, "Oh, okay, we'll just go to minor leagues games". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's a lot cheaper that way.
L:  Mhm.  It's like --
R:  You know, I know we quit going to the Indians games only because they got just too expensive.  And that's, you know, fifty dollars a person so you're talking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two people go, you have to spend at least a hundred dollars --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- just to see a baseball game which you could see free on TV.
L:  Mhm.  So -- and I don't -- I mean, I suppose some of the money they're getting for salary is the televised games and the commercials, but, you know, it's not the same on television. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So I think it's a shame that they've --
R:  No, it's not the same --
L:  -- they've gone this way.
R:  -- on television, but it is a lot cheaper.
L:  Oh, absolutely and --
R:  You know?  And I don't think they should be going on strike.  I think that's ridiculous.
L:  Y- you know, it -- it would be one thing if they were saying, "Oh, we're going on strike 'cause we want safer work environments or if we want --" I don't know.
R:  Better medical.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  But it --
R:  -- better pension, something.
L:  But the point they're making millions of dollars [LAUGH] it's really hard for me to get sympathetic. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, especially and then they want more on top of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like you said if it was for medical or dental or, you know, prescriptions, you know --
L:  No.
R:  -- they want better that.
L:  I might even understand at the minor league level where they're not getting paid very much at all.  But people who are making millions -- mm. [LAUGH]  Well, and -- and I recently about there's a high school student who just signed like a ninety one million dollar contract.  And I don't -- I don't remember whether that was -- I think that was with Nike because they're convinced he's going to be the next big NBA star.
R:  Oh, you got to be kidding me.
L:  And I thought, "What?  How is that kid ever gonna have any concept of money?"
R:  Exactly.  'Cause he's just -- and that's just within Nike, that's not saying what he's going to get paid once he gets into the major leagues.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's a --
R:  Yeah, but figure how that's another thing.  All these, you know, they want more money then they get to endorse all these products so they get more money on top of that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're still complaining and they want to go on strike.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Like, you know -- you -- you already have the great good fortune of playing for a living, which is a wonderful thing, and -- and yes certainly I think they should get paid for that, but wow.
R:  Yeah, not to get paid as much as they're getting paid.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- i- it's really gone over -- over the t- -- and I'll grant it, they have a shorter career than most people, but, you know, ninety million, that's certainly I think enough for any person to live on for their entire life. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, exactly.  If I could just earn one million I'd be happy with.
L:  You know, you invest that well and that's -- yeah --
R:  Plus it's --
L:  -- that could last a lifetime. [LAUGH]
R:  I know my parents go to a minor league game.  They live in El Paso, Texas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and they see the Diablo's and they -- they don't mind going [NOISE] there because it is minor league --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's not a lot, you know?  Hot dogs are like two for a dollar. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  And it's fun --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the players seem to be doing it -- well, to have a good time [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- too because they love the game.
R:  And now like now where, you know?  I don't know, it -- they just seem -- and the -- the way they throw their tantrums and everything and --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- and have their fights.  And then the coaches aren't, you know, good role models for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- these youngsters either.
L:  No.
R:  You know, they way they're cussing and throwing things and hitting the players and --
L:  It -- it -- it -- there comes a point of, "Wait a minute, can we redefine good sportsmanship [LAUGH] and professionalism?" 'cause you're not seeing much of it.
R:  No, and if this is happening now, can you imagine what's going to be happening in the future?
L:  [SIGH] Not a good thing, no.
R:  You know?
L:  And it -- and it is a poor example and, you know, I'd like to think that there's something more than just a particular call or winning a particular game, but that there's -- well, like in any part of life, there's [SIGH] -- there's a playing well sort of thing.  A professionalism that matters and how we treat people that matters.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [MN] But --
R:  You know, and most of the time, you know, if you ask a player for an autograph, you know, you -- you think you're asking them for one of their arms.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause they just get so cocky and I think it's 'cause of all the money they're making.
L:  Y- -- and that would make sense.  I mean, it -- it's unfortunate 'cause money certainly doesn't define the worth of a person.
R:  No, it doesn't.
L:  But --
R:  But they think it does.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And like I said, I just don't agree with the strike.  I think what they're making is more than enough for any family to live on comfortably.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know?  And then, you know, even if they didn't have medical, who cares?
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, what they get paid, they can afford to go to a hospital.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  They can buy a hospital, you know?
L:  Yeah, they could -- they could buy their own one. [LAUGH]  No, granted not -- you know, there's the star salaries and then there's the people who aren't making that kind of money.  And -- but I don't know, what is the l- -- you know, I have no idea what the lowest salary is for a professional baseball player.
R:  Yeah, neither do I.
L:  You know, I -- I think it's in the area of forty, fifty thousand, which, you know, certainly that's --
R:  That's not too bad for --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and then they don't play every game.
L:  Well --
R:  You know, and then yes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they go to somewhere -- in the summer things to practice but it's not grueling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not like somebody who has to, you know, use a shovel, you know, to dig holes or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or anything like that.  Or people working in the mine where they're really working hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- [inaudible] I think teachers should be making as much as they're making.
L:  Y- -- I'm sorry, you think teachers should or shouldn't?
R:  Should.
L:  Oh should, yeah, I was going to say, "Are you a--"  Certainly what they're contributing to society compared to say, what a baseball player is contributing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to society. [LAUGH]
R:  They're shaping these minds --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and the way the baseball players are shaping the, um, kids minds they're thinking, you know, it's okay to be greedy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And --
L:  And to, "I'm above the law 'cause I'm a star".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, wow, that's not what I want my kid thinking. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't either.  You know, that it's okay, you know, to make all that money, to ask all that money.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and m- most of them they use -- you know, use it for drugs and things like that.  And that's ridiculous.
L:  It -- yeah.
R:  And like I said, and that money should be given at least to the teachers, the professors, you know.  They don't make that much.
L:  Mhm.  No they don't.
R:  [NOISE] And they're the ones --
L:  If -- and -- and it's hard to -- ah, hard to get into.  I think there are a lot of people who'd be good teachers and aren't because, it's like, "Well, okay, I have to work for free for a year [LAUGH] and then --"  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, you know --
L:  So it's --
R:  So if they took -- it's a thing to discuss there, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And go- -- and -- and I didn't even know they were going on strike.
L:  I -- I didn't either.  Um, and I'm wondering is it baseball?  Is there another?  Well, I guess basketball season's almost over isn't it?
R:  Yeah, and football won't start until the fall, so it has to be the baseball --
L:  Has to be, yeah.
R:  -- players.
L:  Can't imagine what else it would be [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah.  It can't be the golf players because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in -- that's so boring nobody would care to watch them anyway.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  What was it someone was telling me?  Oh, yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they -- they watch it -- reading a book on playing golf online is almost as close as you can get to not breathing. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, geez, that's what I ought to do when I can't sleep at night.
L:  There you go. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [SIGH] yeah. [LAUGH]  So [SIGH] but I guess that I -- I -- I haven't followed it.  We don't have a television so I -- my -- my dad's a -- a baseball fan, at least a Detroit fan.  But I haven't --
R:  And you don't have a television in your house?
L:  No, no.  We -- I -- when I moved out of home fifteen years ago, decided not to get one and that's just been kind of nice. [LAUGH]  My husband and I play a lot of games and read and -- and that sort of thing.  And okay, so miss out on things like, "Oh, there's a baseball strike". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, see --
L:  But --
R:  -- most of mine, it was [inaudible] from the Today Show.  And I guess I just wasn't paying attention --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- this morning --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- when they were saying they were on strike.  I can't believe you can live without a TV.
L:  Well, yeah, it's, um --
R:  I know in the summer months it's no big deal for us because we're mostly outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but in the winter -- you know, I do, you know, reading, needlepoint --
L:  Mhm.
R:  In fact that's what I was doing when they were calling, was some --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- needlepoint.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know [LAUGH] so --
L:  I like to crochet.  That's -- that's my big --
