R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name is Antonio.
L:  Hello, Antonio.  This is, uh, Cissy.  How are you today?
R:  Good.  What was your name again?
L:  My name is Cissy.
R:  Cissy, nice to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.  What changes have you made since September the eleventh?
R:  Well, I'm calling from, uh, actually I'm calling from New York City.  Um, I was actually in the Trade Center.  Um --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah, I, um -- it -- it's funny when I called in and I got this topic I was like, "Great". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I work for -- I work for J.P. Morgan.  Uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we have an office in the Trade Center and, um, I was very lucky because that [NOISE] day I was, um, just coming to work.  Uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, it -- I was actually just, you know, having a late day like I normally do but [SIGH], um, I was lucky because I never even got into the building so that was -- that was good.  Uh --
L:  Oh, yes it is.  God was looking out for you, wasn't he?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So, we, um, we [SIGH], um, we had to, um, move offices and we moved offices in November, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, uh, I -- I've just -- my life is really different since then.  Now that I think about it like two years ago it was -- and things are really different for me.  Like I -- [SIGH] I spend a lot less time working and a lot more time with my family now.
L:  That's good.  That's good.
R:  I --
L:  Time is precious.  We don't --
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  We don't always realize how precious it is.
R:  Yeah, I, um, I, you know, I -- I've just made such big changes.  I -- I used to be a workaholic and I just realize how kind of futile it is, um, to, you know, be focused on any one thing.  Uh --
L:  Right, especially when you have a family, you know, it's so important to be with them and share with them and all.
R:  Right, right.  Um, so, yeah, a lot more time, um, a lot more time with my family and [MN], uh --
L:  You have children?
R:  No, I don't have children yet but I'm working on it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Working -- that's -- I -- that's actually part of -- part of the, uh, spending more time with my family.  I -- I -- I definitely want kids and [SIGH], um, [COUGH] I never really wanted kids before then so it's -- it's kinda interesting.  Um --
L:  Well, that's -- that's good though that you -- maybe you've had the experience to see that -- that you need to spend time with the children instead of working so much.  I know a lot of men [SIGH] make --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that mistake.  They, uh, like you say become workaholics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and [SIGH] -- and the children they kinda become secondary and -- and you miss out on awful lot when you do that.
R:  Right, right.  I -- I just realized that no one's gonna remember me really for the job I did.  They're gonna remember me for --
L:  Nah, nah.
R:  That's right, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  I just got laid off on a job that I had been with for umpteen years and -- and now then, you know, it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was never there.  Uh --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  The -- the -- yeah, well I mean as far as the company is concerned.  You know, i- it's just that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- things go on and -- and, uh, uh, even though that you did a good job and all that's concerned well, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Nothing's really gonna change because you're not there. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  I, you know, I like to think that everyone is kind of -- everyone in a company is kind of replaceable.  I mean, even the -- the head of the company is replaceable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things -- things just kind of go on and [SIGH], you know, if you -- I don't know if you ever read Dilbert cartoons but, you know --
L:  Some.
R:  I often feel like -- yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I often feel like I was like a corporate robot, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE] It's like, you know, that's why -- I, you know, and that day was -- was really hard because I -- you know, you do -- you did see a lot of suffering.  People just, you know -- and a lot of pain and suffering and whatnot and, um, it -- it also made me, um, [LIPSMACK] really appreciative of the city I live in.  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  This is a, you know, it's -- it's not for everyone.  It's a great, great city.  Um, and I just started taking more advantage of the fact that, you know, like --
L:  Are you in the city itself or are you -- you --
R:  Yeah, yeah. 
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
R:  I work -- I work down town.  Um, and I work in the financial district and I live uptown.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, [SIGH] I live in the theater district and, um, I just started taking more advantage of -- of that sort of thing too because, um -- right now, unfortunately, like tourism is still really off here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so there's a lot of great things in terms of museums or theaters --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, [inaudible] just --
L:  Well, it's been a long time since I've been to New York but it, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  At that time I just wish I'd had more time to spend there.  I was on vacation and -- and really I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- couldn't see, you know, all the things that you'd really like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to see.  Uh, because there's a lot of things going on there.  A lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  A lot more than people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think actually realize. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They kind of think of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Broadway and that's about it.
R:  Right, right.  And where are you now?
L:  I'm in Fort Worth, Texas.
R:  Oh, you are?  That's great.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was just in Texas yesterday because I --
L:  Good.
R:  -- was -- I flew from, uh, New Orleans to Houston.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and I love your airport in Houston.  It was great.  It was really great but I -- I love Texas people in general because everyone -- you know, they say Texans are really friendly, that's really true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Texans are great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Texans are great.  It just -- you know, going down south I just re- -- you know, people are so kind to each other down there and I don't know if it's -- that they're really [NOISE] -- I think they're really nice, or maybe it's that they're just acting like they're nice but --
L:  No, no, it -- it just lots of times --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people just they think -- they don't even think about it.  I mean, it -- it's just, you know, seems like part of the nature or something like [SIGH], uh, I mean it's just automatically --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that you speak to somebody or you say, "Hi", to somebody and you don't think anything about it.  You know, i- it's just the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Uh, and I know that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people that visit here they just look at you kind of like -- you can almost tell when there's a -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's a tourist, you know, and you just kinda said "Hi", or "Good morning", or something like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then they'll [SIGH] -- they'll come back and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- look at you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kinda funny and then you say, "Uh-oh, that must be a tourist". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Uh-oh, they're not from Texas". [LAUGH]
R:  It's funny because I -- like you know New Yorkers have that kind of hard attitude, you know, and -- and New Yorkers are often seen as like abrasive but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it's -- it's really obvious to me because I'm almost like -- when I went down to New Orleans this weekend like and I went through Texas like it -- like I'm almost like shocked.  Like almost to the point where you can probably see on my face at how nice people are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  It's kinda like going into another world.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly, so, um   So, uh, that's cool.  I'm glad you're   I'm -- you enjoy Texas it sounds like.
L:  I -- I love Texas.  Yeah, I do.  I was born and reared in Texas.  I've moved around.  I went to El Paso for a while but I wanted to come back --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to Fort Worth.  I enjoy Fort Worth.  And there's a lot going on around here.  You don't really have to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- go that greater distance to [SIGH] enjoy just about anything that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, uh, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Have good culture, area and then of course there's a lot of lakes and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If you're into sports --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all and then, uh, I don't know, there's just a lot to do.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You can keep very active.
R:  Wh- where is -- where is Fort Worth in [NOISE] -- in relation to like [NOISE] El Paso or Houston?
L:  Uh, it's north of Houston.  Two hundred and sixty two miles and it's west of El Paso, six hundred and fifteen miles.
R:  Okay.  'Cause I have -- I have been to El Paso a couple of times 'cause I have family there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and, um, [NOISE] but -- but Texas is such a big place like, you know --
L:  Well, I used to live right on the corner of Federal and Dakota, right on the side of the mountain in El Paso.
R:  [SIGH] You know, I [NOISE] -- the -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The only -- I don't remember where they live but [NOISE] they live next to a, um, [NOISE] it was like a -- it was one of the first like Casco's.  It wasn't [NOISE] a Casco but it was like a stop and shop or something like that and --
L:  M- --
R:  -- they lived right behind it.  Um --
L:  Hm.
R:  And, uh, it -- I think there was like [inaudible] Circle or something like that.  Um, but it was like a really desolate area.  Part --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I mem- -- I remember going as a kid and then, um, as I get older it kept on getting more and more built up.  But they still live in a pretty -- I guess --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- if there is a little --
L:  It's built up a lot.  I haven't been back in quite a few years but you're sitting right out basically in the middle of the desert.  You've got to do a lot of driving to -- to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- go anywhere outside of El Paso.  I mean, at least a hundred, a hundred and fifty miles usually in any direction to --
R:  Right.
L:  To really get to anything.
R:  It was -- it was very nice though.  I really liked it.  Um, and I liked the, um, you know, there's a -- a -- like a huge Mexican influence there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, um, we used to go across the border to go shopping but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- food -- the food in El Paso is incredible.
L:  Oh, yeah.  It's very good, very good.
R:  I love Mexican food, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that -- that was the highlight of the trip.  But I haven't been back there in a -- in a couple of years now.  So, I'll have to go back eventually and see my family there.  So --
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's good.
R:  Oh, that's all part of the September eleventh stuff, right, seeing my family. So --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Well, that's what it should be.  You know, I -- I -- I -- of course I'm an older person and I see in a lot of the younger people that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Uh, family has become secondary to them and I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  To me family should be number one.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, but it -- you look --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- around these days and -- and you do, you see like the -- the -- the family unit --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is secondary --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to what it used to be.  Course, you know, you used to -- it was family first and then you thought about everything else but --
R:  Right.
L:  But now then it seems like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- self have gotten in the way of -- of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- family and -- and that really bothers me.
R:  Yeah, and I -- I'm very lucky 'cause my, um, I -- I come from a f- -- there's -- there's -- it's, um, it's me and then I have five sisters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, so my parents had six altogether and my mother always made, you know, it a point that we had to have dinner together [NOISE], you know, no matter what.
L:  That's good.
R:  So, I'm very lucky about that 'cause I always got to, you know, at least have dinner with my parents and -- and my, um, and my sisters but, you know, since then we've all kind of gone our separate ways but I don't think there's one holiday I've missed so far.  Um, you know, um, you know, I've -- I've thought about going on trips and stuff like that for Thanksgiving or Christmas but my mother kind of nixes[?] it for me [LAUGH] so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's no, absolutely, no way. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely no way we'd be allowed to do that, so --
L:  Oh. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I am just so glad that you made it through nine eleven.  That -- that's just, um, I -- I've talked to several people, not -- not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --  in this but I -- I know some people that, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  One missed an airplane because, uh, he was supposed to -- to be in New York and he would've been at the Trade Centers.  Uh, and, um, he missed his airplane and he -- he said that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that was god's intervention on that.
R:  How lucky, yeah.
L:  That, uh, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he missed, you know, that he missed his flight because otherwise he -- he probably wouldn't, you know, be here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- today.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think that's a good testimony that he has and I've talked to a couple of other people that were -- were there and, uh, it -- [SIGH] I don't think that there's any way that you could describe it, um, by not being there just by, you know, even -- 'cause it was so traumatic even what we saw on television but the actually
