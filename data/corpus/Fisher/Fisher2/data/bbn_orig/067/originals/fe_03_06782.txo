L:  Hi, I'm Tully.
R:  Hi, I'm Tania.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.  Is this your first call?
L:  No, I've had like really light and easy calls [LAUGH] you know like --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yo- your favorite male and -- you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- sports stuff.  But this one is like, you know, quite a -- quite a topic.
R:  Well, this is --
L:  Um.
R:  -- my very -- my very first one, so bear with me. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really.  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  And what a topic --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- too, I had to get a tough one.
L:  I know.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Okay.
L:  Well, I don't know if September eleventh -- a- after it happened I was a little afraid to fly but --
R:  Yeah, me --
L:  -- after, you know --
R:  -- me too, but I mean I really don't fly all that much and I live way out in the country in Wisconsin so it -- it wasn't like I was really all that afraid of anything happening.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean I -- I mean I -- and, you know, when all of the anthrax warnings went out and everything I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was watching, you know, my mail like a hawk and there was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so many people joking about it and oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It -- it's a little weird to, ah -- to joke about it.  Yeah, I live -- I'm in Philadelphia so I'm like two hours away from New York --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- but -- yeah, but you know the thing was is like, you know, and e- -- and ever since in Philadelphia -- 'cause everyone always thinks about Philadelphia as like, "Oh, it's great 'cause you're like two hours from New York and three hours from DC" like that's the best thing about it.  So I'm like, "No [inaudible] about hitting Philly" which is, you know, a very [LAUGH] -- I mean, it's not the smartest way to think about it, but, you know, it -- of all the east coast cities, it's -- or the bigger ones, you know, besides Boston -- when like the planes came from Boston they hit DC and they hit New York and, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  So --
R:  -- exactly.  And that -- and the other plane went -- went down and that wasn't even in a metropolitan area where that --
L:  No.
R:  -- plane went down.
L:  Yeah.  That was like, um, right outside of, ah, Pittsburgh I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't if you can really change your life too much about it.  I mean, I'm glad that they're doing much -- they're being safer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about these and they're actually going through checked luggage now.  But they're still not going through the cargo stuff, like the stuff that's being shipped --
R:  Really?
L:  -- which I think -- yeah, which is a -- I think they're supposed to start doing that but -- I mean if there's shipping something on your plane and something that somehow happens to be a bomb -- I don't know, it's just --
R:  Right, exactly. [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know how much you can do. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And that technology is getting so sophisticated and everything that -- you know, they're -- they're going to find ways to hide things and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- that's kind of scary but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  -- I've always really liked to fly even though I haven't done it a lot and -- but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I haven't flown at all since that happened, but not really because of that, but I have thought, you know, well maybe I should try --
L:  You haven't because you haven't had the need?
R:  Pretty much, yeah.  I mean everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, we drive pretty much everywhere, so -- yeah.
L:  Got you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I've flown quite a bit.  Um, trying to think, I -- I -- I actually prefer to fly 'cause, um, yeah I just don't have the patience for driving.  [LAUGH] Like anything over two hours I'm just like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, we needed to take, ah, a plane so I -- yeah, since September eleventh I've flown a lot actually.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  Ah --
R:  I mean one thing I've noticed --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- is that what's really great is so many people have gotten to be so patriotic and I've -- and I've been that way too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And while I might not support all of the ideas that our Government has, you know, it's -- you know, it's really good that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they're really taking all of those extra measures and, you know, the homeland security and all of that.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, and --
L:  But I -- I -- I also worry about -- you know, 'cause they're holding, I don't know, I think it's Jose Padilla.  He's -- he's an American citizen and he's -- he's being held without a lawyer.  He's not charged.  He -- and he could be held indefinitely.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I -- I worry that -- for -- I -- I don't like, ah, espec- -- I still don't like it even when there's not American citizens but I definitely don't like it.  Like I understand how American citizens who are not American citizens don't have the same rights, which, you know, is fair enough, you know.  If you really wanted the same rights you would [MN] [NOISE] take the time or put the ball into motion to become an American citizen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you can.
R:  [NOISE] Exactly, exactly.
L:  But I -- I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't like that an American citizen whether he is, [LAUGH] you know, [several inaudible words] now but then they'll [inaudible] like that has been, you know -- is being held secretly indefinitely without a lawyer being available to him.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like I -- I -- I -- I don't like what's -- I fear that, um, September eleventh and this terrorism is being used to take away people's lives and what we're going to find is that -- that we have no rights and we're not really all that much safe- -- more safer.  You know, or, yeah, any more safer than we were on -- before.  So --
R:  Right.  And I think I was just reading last week that they still have some of those, um, suspected terrorists still held in -- where is it?  Is it Puerto Rico or Cuba --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- or --
L:  Guantanamo Bay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- off of Cuba.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been thinking, my goodness that's been [inaudible] years.  To think that, you know, that --
L:  Yeah, that has been a few years and th- -- and they don't seem to be processing 'em or doing something to them.  They're just in prison.
R:  Yeah, the -- the article I read said that they just let some more of them go --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- right.
L:  So I guess the one's who are not dangerous or --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- really have -- 
R:  -- I --
L:  -- 'cause I think -- go ahead.
R:  No, I just -- I think the ones that they've managed to investigate, you know, that they are letting some of them go, but I don't think --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- [inaudible] realizes they were still being held.  I didn't.
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah, there's --
R:  No.
L:  -- a lot still being held and I -- I heard this story about -- I guess, I forget, I think he's Jordanian or whatever may- -- or something like that.  But they were on a -- they were in Afghanistan -- they happened to be in Afghanistan for whatever reason and were picked up with the Taliban.  They said that they would be, you know -- obviously they would be, you know, clear 'cause they weren't doing anything, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] and they're still there and their families are, like, look, you know, they're not involved in -- I -- I understand it takes some time, but I used to like -- so much of this is done in the dark.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, some of it you can't do in the light 'cause it just blows everything, but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- I -- I -- I feel like this administration really -- well, things are still -- are still a bit like -- you know, like with -- with the -- when they were meeting with oil execs, you know?  They're like, "Well, we really can't talk about that 'cause it has to do with economic you know strategic development and planning" and stuff, but it's just like, "Come on now, you could -- you -- you might not release everything but, yeah, we're not asking for like state secrets.  We're asking about a conversation or several conversations".  And the whole point was that people may not be able to speak freely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they couldn't -- if they didn't know their stuff was in -- or, um, whatever they said was confidential, but I'm like, "You guys aren't doctors, you're not priests" [LAUGH] you know what I mean?  Like, I don't think --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- there should be an expectation that things should be confidential if you're -- if you're in a meeting.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  I have to agree with that completely.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and that's my greatest fear.  And I think [NOISE] because of September -- and every time someone disagrees a- a- -- or, you know, questions what's going on, they bring back, you know, "Are you with us or a- against us?  Are you against terrorists, 'cause if you're -- you know -- if you're questioning what we're saying then" and [inaudible] these might be broad overstatements about it, but that's my feelings on them, th- this administration.  That, um --
R:  Well, exactly.  And how they -- they boycotted France --
L:  Yeah [inaudible].
R:  -- you know, be- -- no-one -- and I was at --
L:  All the freedom fries instead of French fries?  
R:  Right.
L:  They're not French.  It was made up by someone -- our French toast.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I guess the guy's name was -- his last name was French.  I mean, that's [inaudible]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And the [inaudible].  Don't see why like we wouldn't come -- I mean, I love French toast and I'm not -- not -- I just don't see any French chef coming up with French toast.  But [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah I think -- you're right, they -- I don't know, it's hard to, you know, place faith in that when such silly things go on.
R:  Right, and they --
L:  And some of it --
R:  -- I under- -- I understand that they -- you know, they're doing it to try to protect the country, but it's almost like it's gotten to be a click, and if you're not part of our click then we don't want anything to do with you.  And --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you --
L:  'Cause they were talking about how they were going to make France pay, and I'm just like, "You know, that's just counterproductive". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, exactly.  And do you think that's going to make them any more interested in helping next time if it happens again? 
L:  Well --
R:  And it will.
L:  -- you know -- ah, you know, if we just -- I don't know, I hate to think of A- Americans as being petty.  I mean everyone has the ability to be petty, well, no matter -- ah, no matter what their nationality is.  
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, the Government shouldn't be outward- outwardly that petty. [LAUGH]
R:  I think so too.
L:  Yes.
R:  They have to be more objective and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- exactly.
L:  Especially -- we need some help with Iraq.  That's why I'm like, you know, tired of just being unlucky then the grid falls, but now we're in it.  But, you know, 'cause you hear about -- what is it?  Seven people died this ye- -- ah, this, um -- this past weekend?  Seven soldiers.
R:  Oh, I didn't hear that.  I just --
L:  Yeah, I guess --
R:  -- I --
L:  -- a couple who were like, I don't know.  It's going to take a while for Iraq and I don't know if we're in it for the long haul.  And I know this is -- and it all goes back to nine one one.  So --
R:  Right, you know, and you think of the money that they're -- that they're spending to try to rebuild Iraq.  And the -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  and it's a -- it's a good thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they're trying to help them, but I just have a real problem with our country, you know, subjecting our views and everything on -- on another country and getting so involved in rebuilding them, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I have a -- I have a problem with that.  Because they're a totally different culture.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  I would feel better if it was like a broader coalition, not just Britain and -- I guess Spain is also helping out with that.  Or maybe stay with an Af- Afghanistan still.  I don't think Spain's even helping with, um, Iraq yet.  But besides Britain and the -- and the United States, I don't think there's anyone over there.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  So I kind of --
L:  So, yeah.
R:  -- have a problem with --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- that, but [NOISE] you know, there's some of our, you know, armed forces are coming home and that's a good thing.  I mean, some of them locally and it sure, you know, like I said before --
