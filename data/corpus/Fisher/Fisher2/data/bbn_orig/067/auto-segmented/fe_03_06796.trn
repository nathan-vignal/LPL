I HAVEN'T EITHER AND WHEN THEY SAID PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES I MEAN YOU DON'T USUALLY HEAR ABOUT IT IN I DON'T KNOW I GUESS I DON'T FOLLOW A LOT OF SPORTS BUT LIKE BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL AND STUFF I THOUGHT WAS MORE OF AN INDIVIDUAL SALARY BASIS  (fe_03_06796-A-0005)
PROBABLY YOU GET MORE PUBLICITY OUT OF IT  (fe_03_06796-A-0006)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06796-A-0007)
THEN YOU'D HEAR MORE ABOUT IT BUT THEY'RE ALL SUCH INDIVIDUALLY BASED I THINK ON THEIR  (fe_03_06796-A-0008)
SALARIES BUT  (fe_03_06796-A-0009)
YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT AS MUCH  (fe_03_06796-A-0010)

YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE WORKING PERSON DOESN'T TEND TO MAKE VERY MUCH MONEY AND YOU ACTUALLY WORK EIGHT TO TEN HOURS A DAY AND [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06796-A-0019)
FIVE DAYS A WEEK I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LOT OF TRAINING INVOLVED THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH BUT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06796-A-0020)

BUT THEN THEY HAVE I MEAN THEY GET PAID AS A TEAM OR EVEN INDIVIDUALLY THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY INTO THAT THAT I  (fe_03_06796-A-0030)
MEAN YOU HAVE TO WONDER I MEAN WHAT IS THE STOPPING POINT FOR THEIR SALARIES 'CAUSE  (fe_03_06796-A-0031)
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE SOMEONE COMING UP AND BETTER THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06796-A-0032)
THE SAME QUALIFICATIONS AND EVERYONE THAT COMES UP IS GOING TO WANT TO GET MORE MONEY  (fe_03_06796-A-0033)
I ONLY FROM WHAT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS MORE MONEY  (fe_03_06796-A-0034)
I DON'T KNOW THAT I MEAN I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY GET FOR BENEFITS BUT FROM WHAT I'VE ALWAYS HEARD IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SALARYWISE  (fe_03_06796-A-0035)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06796-A-0036)
RIGHT BUT I THINK ONCE THEY GET INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE SPECIAL LIKE THEY'RE REALLY GOOD PLAYERS THAT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE TEAM'S NOT GOING TO WANT TO LET THEM GO  (fe_03_06796-A-0037)
AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO NAME THEIR PRICE AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY IT THEN IT WE'RE GOING TO GO ON STRIKE OR YOU KNOW FORM UP WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM TO MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TEAM TO PLAY  (fe_03_06796-A-0038)
SO THEN THE OWNERS ARE FORCED TO COME UP WITH THE EXTRA MONEY  (fe_03_06796-A-0039)

BUT I MEAN I ALSO THOUGHT TOO THAT A UNION THEY WORKED WITH YOU AS A TEAM  (fe_03_06796-A-0045)
BUT I THINK THE INDIVIDUAL THE INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS ARE MORE SALARIED BASED ON  (fe_03_06796-A-0046)
THEMSELVES CONFIDENTIALITY WISE  (fe_03_06796-A-0047)
'CAUSE YOU NEVER HEAR WELL MAYBE YOU DO I GUESS WHEN THEY GO ON STRIKE AND IT COMES OUT BUT IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT YOU HEAR SO AND SO MAKES THIS MUCH MONEY AND SO AND SO MAKES THIS MUCH MONEY  (fe_03_06796-A-0048)

MEAN I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY ALL START AT THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S GOT TO BE BASED ON  (fe_03_06796-A-0054)
YOU KNOW THEIR SPECIFIC TRAINING OR HOW WELL THEY'VE DONE OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREER  (fe_03_06796-A-0055)
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE I MEAN PERSONALLY THAT  (fe_03_06796-A-0057)
I THINK THAT IF THEY'RE SUPPOSEDLY IF THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION BUT WHEN YOU GO INTO A SPORT LIKE BASEBALL OR FOOTBALL OR WHATEVER I MEAN THESE GUYS GO INTO IT BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE SPORT  (fe_03_06796-A-0058)
AND WHEN YOU GO IN AND LOVE A SPORT AND YOU'RE MAKING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ALREADY  (fe_03_06796-A-0059)
I MEAN YOU'RE KIND OF  (fe_03_06796-A-0060)
GETTING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO TYPE OF THE THING  (fe_03_06796-A-0061)
AND THEN I MEAN ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT I MEAN I'M NOT BAGGING A SPORT BUT YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT NORMALLY WILL SIT HOME TO STAY HOME AND WATCH A GAME OR  (fe_03_06796-A-0062)
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO CHANGE A SCHEDULE TO WATCH A GAME AND IT'S MORE OF A H- A PASTIME FOR THEM AND WHEN YOU WHEN THESE PEOPLE EXPECT IT AND THEN THEY DON'T GET IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMEONE'S HOLDING OUT FOR A PAY RAISE I  (fe_03_06796-A-0063)

UM THERE'S NO QUESTIONS ASKED AND WE CAN HOLD OUT FOR A PAY RAISE OF COURSE BUT IF WE JUST DEMAND WE'RE GOING ON STRIKE AND NOT COMING TO WORK WITHOUT A PAY RAISE  (fe_03_06796-A-0065)
MOST LIKELY NOT MATTER WHERE YOU ARE THEY'RE GOING TO SAY FORGET IT  (fe_03_06796-A-0066)
IT THEY DON'T I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE UNION I THINK IT'S MORE I WOULD THINK IT'S MORE THE PLAYERS  (fe_03_06796-A-0067)
BECAUSE I MEAN I DON'T THE UNIONS REALLY GET INVOLVED UNLESS THERE IS A PROBLEM  (fe_03_06796-A-0068)
AND I I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE UNION IS GOING TO TELL ALL OF THESE PLAYERS TO GO ON STRIKE  (fe_03_06796-A-0069)
OR FORCE THEM TO GO ON STRIKE I MEAN I WOULD THINK THAT THEY'RE MORE LIKE THEY'RE DOING IT AS A TEAM FOR THEIR FRIENDS BECAUSE IF THEIR FRIENDS GET IT THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT TOO BUT  (fe_03_06796-A-0070)
UM  (fe_03_06796-A-0071)
OTHERWISE IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE CAME UP AND WANTED A RAISE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE TO 'EM THEY COULD VERY EASILY JUST TELL 'EM NO AND TRADE 'EM OR HOWEVER THAT WORKS  (fe_03_06796-A-0072)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06796-A-0073)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06796-A-0074)
