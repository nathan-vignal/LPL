WELL I DISAGREE WITH THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY MAKE COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT THAT THE FRANCHISES MAKE IS VERY MINIMAL AND  (fe_03_06791-A-0006)
THOSE COMPANY OWNERS ARE NOT RISKING  (fe_03_06791-A-0007)
THEIR BONES OR THEIR [LAUGHTER] MUSCLES BEING STRAINED LIKE THE PLAYERS AND I I DON'T THINK THAT THEY REALLY  (fe_03_06791-A-0009)
GET WHAT THEY COMPLETELY DESERVE BUT THE WAY TO ERADICATE THAT IS TO START ATHLE- AH WELL ATHLETIC COMPANIES THAT ARE OWNED BY THE ATHLETES THAT'S THE ONLY WAY  (fe_03_06791-A-0010)
TO AVOID BEING AH PAID LOWER THAN WHAT YOU'RE WORTH  (fe_03_06791-A-0011)
