SO  (fe_03_06714-A-0006)
UM WELL I'VE BEEN I'M KIND OF A BOOKWORM PERSONALITY [LAUGHTER] AND I'VE THERE'S NEVER BEEN I'VE NEVER BEEN INTERESTED IN SPORTS THE ONLY REASON I'M TRYING TO EXERCISE IS I WANNA LOSE WEIGHT  (fe_03_06714-A-0007)
BUT I HATE IT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06714-A-0008)
SO  (fe_03_06714-A-0009)
YOU KNOW I'LL MAKE MYSELF DO IT I'LL GET ALL PSYCHED UP AND MAKE MYSELF GO BUT I CAN'T MAINTAIN IT FOR VERY LONG  (fe_03_06714-A-0010)
I UNDERSTAND THAT  (fe_03_06714-A-0011)
NEXT MONTH THE GYM THAT I GO TO HAS A BEAUTIFUL OUTDOOR POOL  (fe_03_06714-A-0012)
AND NEXT MONTH THEY'RE STARTING UM WATER AEROBICS UM IN THE EVENING AFTER WORK  (fe_03_06714-A-0013)
SO MY GOAL IS TO GO TO THAT [LAUGHTER] STARTING IN JUNE MM  (fe_03_06714-A-0014)
WELL YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06714-A-0015)
AND I AM OVERWEIGHT AND SO THAT MAKES GOING TO THE GYM THAT MUCH HARDER BECAUSE THERE'S ALL THESE SKINNY LITTLE GIRLS AND  (fe_03_06714-A-0016)
YEAH  (fe_03_06714-A-0017)
LUCKILY MY HUSBAND AND I ARE MEMBERS OF THIS GYM AND IT'S NOT REALLY ONE OF THOSE MEAT MARKETS IT'S MOSTLY OLDER MARRIED PEOPLE  (fe_03_06714-A-0018)
SO AT LEAST IN THAT REGARD I FEEL A LITTLE BETTER  (fe_03_06714-A-0019)
I LIKE WALKING IT'S JUST SAME LIKE YOU BY THE TIME I GET HOME FROM WORK I'M TIRED [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06714-A-0021)

MY HUSBAND WILL WORK OUT AT THE GYM AND HE LIKES GOING TO THE GYM SO HE'LL LIFT THE WEIGHTS AND UM  (fe_03_06714-A-0025)
DO THE TR- THE BIKES AND STUFF  (fe_03_06714-A-0026)
AND HE ENJOYS IT SO IT'S EASY FOR HIM TO GET MOTIVATED TO GO  (fe_03_06714-A-0027)
BUT UM HE HAS TENDONITIS IN HIS ANKLES SO HE WON'T GO WALKING WITH ME CAUSE THEN HIS FEET HURT  (fe_03_06714-A-0028)

STAY AT EACH MACHINE WITH ME BUT BUT THEN HE DIDN'T GET A VERY GOOD WORKOUT BECAUSE IT TOOK SO LONG  (fe_03_06714-A-0032)
YES AND SO HE STARTED GOING BY HIMSELF AND THAT'S PROBABLY ANOTHER REASON WHY I'M LESS MOTIVATED NOW I HAVE TO GO BY MYSELF  (fe_03_06714-A-0033)
IT'S KINDA BORING  (fe_03_06714-A-0034)
BECAUSE HE'S LIKE HE USED TO LIFT WEIGHTS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING  (fe_03_06714-A-0035)
AND SO I SLOW HIM DOWN  (fe_03_06714-A-0036)
