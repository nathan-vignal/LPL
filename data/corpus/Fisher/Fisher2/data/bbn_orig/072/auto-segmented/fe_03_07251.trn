UM I PREPARE MOST FOR MYSELF BUT I'M ON WEIGHT WATCHERS SO I'M DOING WINNING POINTS ON WEIGHT WATCHERS SO IT'S MUCH MORE FUN TO PREPARE FOOD WHEN YOU HAVE COMPANY THAN IT IS FOR YOURSELF  (fe_03_07251-B-0007)
ARE YOU A SINGLE PERSON OR ARE YOU MARRIED  (fe_03_07251-B-0008)

AND UM IT'S MORE MORE ECONOMICAL TO GO OUT TO DINNER AT A RESTAURANT AND BRING HOME EVEN HALF THE PORTIONS YOU EAT IN A RESTAURANT  (fe_03_07251-B-0015)
THAN IT IS FOR YOU TO MAKE A COMPLETE MEAL AT HOME BY THE TIME YOU GET THE VEGETABLES AND THE MEAT AND THE CHICKEN AND THE SALAD AND ALL THE THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S MUCH MUCH MORE UH EXPENSIVE TO EAT AT HOME  (fe_03_07251-B-0016)

I'M RETIRED AND WE'RE ABLE TO TO GO OUT AND HAVE A GLASS OF WINE FOR DINNER AND WHEN YOU OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE YOU FOR YOURSELF  (fe_03_07251-B-0029)

AND THEN BRING THAT IN AND THEY HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SUBWAYS TODAY  (fe_03_07251-B-0035)
THAT I THINK THE PEOPLE REALLY YOU KNOW GO TO SUBWAY PROBABLY A LOT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THEY HAD IN THE PAST YEAH  (fe_03_07251-B-0036)
IT'S FRESH  (fe_03_07251-B-0037)
AND IT'S PORTION CONTROL  (fe_03_07251-B-0038)

THAN I DO OTHERWISE AND UH I WAS EVEN LOOKING AT DR ATKINS DIET AS FAR AS THE DIET'S CONCERNED AND THAT'S EASY WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTAURANT BECAUSE YOU JUST GET STEAK AND SALAD AND UM YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING AS LONG AS IT HAS NO CARBS IN IT SO IN A RESTAURANT YOU CAN PROBABLY CONTROL THE CARBS EQUALLY AS WELL  (fe_03_07251-B-0050)
AS YOU CAN CONTROL THE CARBS UM AT HOME  (fe_03_07251-B-0051)

YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR WEIGHT AND  (fe_03_07251-B-0068)
PORTION CONTROL IF YOU TELL 'EM WHAT YOU WANT SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER IN A RESTAURANT THAN IT IS TO ACTUALLY BE HOME WHEN YOU'RE ON A DIET  (fe_03_07251-B-0069)
