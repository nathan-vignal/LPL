[LAUGHTER] SO THE TOPIC IS FRIENDS  (fe_03_07238-B-0005)
UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0006)
ONE OF THE THINGS IT MENTIONED WAS THAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT OUR BEST FRIEND  (fe_03_07238-B-0007)
UM I HAVE TWO PEOPLE THAT I CONSIDER AS MY BEST FRIEND  (fe_03_07238-B-0008)
AND  (fe_03_07238-B-0009)
UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0010)
ONE OF THEM IS A GAL THAT I'VE BEEN FRIENDS WITH SINCE THE THIRD GRADE AND  (fe_03_07238-B-0011)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07238-B-0012)
FOR WHATEVER REASON EVEN THOUGH SHE AND ME LIKE REALLY  (fe_03_07238-B-0013)
DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT IN COMMON ANYMORE THERE'S STILL SOME KIND OF A COMMON BOND BETWEEN US THAT EVEN THOUGH WE MIGHT NOT TALK FOR A MONTH OR TWO IF WE GET ON THE PHONE IT'S JUST LIKE WE NEVER LOST TOUCH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_07238-B-0014)
AND THEN UH  (fe_03_07238-B-0015)
MY OTHER FRIEND UM WELL ONE THING I NOTICED IS THAT UM AFTER I BECAME AN ADULT  (fe_03_07238-B-0016)
MEANING LIKE AFTER I GOT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_07238-B-0018)
UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0019)
I REALLY DIDN'T SEEM TO DEVELOP LONG LASTING FRIENDSHIPS WITH FEMALES ANYMORE IT'S LIKE IT WAS VERY RARE THAT I EVER MET A FEMALE  (fe_03_07238-B-0020)
MET A NEW FRIEND LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD ALWAYS YOU KNOW MAKE NEW GIRLFRIENDS AND STUFF AND BUT THEN AFTER I BECAME AN ADULT THAT JUST SORT OF STOPPED FOR SOME REASON  (fe_03_07238-B-0021)
UM BUT ANYWAY I DID MEET ONE ONE LADY UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0022)
WHEN I WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY NINE OR THIRTY  (fe_03_07238-B-0023)
AND SHE AND I ARE STILL FRIENDS WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS NOW  (fe_03_07238-B-0024)
SO AND I SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME CONNECTION WITH HER THAT I HAVE WITH THE OTHER FRIEND  (fe_03_07238-B-0025)
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_07238-B-0026)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07238-B-0029)
MHM  (fe_03_07238-B-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07238-B-0033)
UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0034)
I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE MORE THE TYPE OF PERSON TO JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF CLOSE FRIENDS  (fe_03_07238-B-0035)
UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0036)
AND THOUGH I AM ACQUAINTED WITH A LOT OF FOLKS LIKE PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH AND STUFF I DON'T REALLY CONSIDER THEM  (fe_03_07238-B-0037)
FRIENDS AL- YOU KNOW THEY'RE MY FRIEND BUT I DON'T GO AND HANG OUT WITH THEM OR DO THINGS ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WITH THEM  (fe_03_07238-B-0038)
SO THEREFORE I CLASSIFY THAT AS ACQUAINTANCES VERSUS AN ACTUAL YOU KNOW FRIENDSHIP  (fe_03_07238-B-0039)
AND THEN UH  (fe_03_07238-B-0040)
SO I GUESS I'D BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT JUST HAS A FEW CLOSE FRIENDS UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0041)
I HAVE A FRIEND THAT IS HERE IN L. A. AND SHE HAS WHAT ANYBODY WOULD CONSIDER SO MANY FRIENDS IT'S JUST  (fe_03_07238-B-0042)
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T MEET A STRANGER YOU KNOW SHE'S ONE OF THOSE TYPES BUT I'M NOT THAT WAY I'M KINDA MORE  (fe_03_07238-B-0043)
PROBABLY A  (fe_03_07238-B-0044)

BUT UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0046)
I DO KNOW THAT I TRY MORE NOW TO UM  (fe_03_07238-B-0047)
LIKE IF I MEET SOMEBODY AND I THINK I KIND OF HAVE A CONNECTION WITH THEM  (fe_03_07238-B-0048)
I'LL ACTUALLY TRY TO MAKE MAKE AN EFFORT TO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07238-B-0049)
MAKE IT INTO A FRIENDSHIP VERSUS HOW I USED TO BE WHICH WAS  (fe_03_07238-B-0050)
I WAS OBLIVIOUS [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] TO THE FACT THAT I R- R- WASN'T GIVING IT A CHANCE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_07238-B-0051)
