IN PROVIDING INFORMATION AND SERVICES AND ACTUALLY A A A MUCH FASTER RESOURCE LINK TO PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVEN'T YOU KNOW WO- WOULDN'T OF HAVE  (fe_03_07231-B-0032)
AS IMMEDIATE UM AH ABILITY TO CONTACT UM USUALLY EVERYTHING WAS EITHER THROUGH TELEPHONE OR THROUGH YOU KNOW THE MAIL  (fe_03_07231-B-0033)
THAT SORT OF THING BUT HAVING THE ACCESSIBILITY OF EMAIL AND AND THAT SORT OF STUFF REALLY REALLY HAS HELPED A LOT I BELIEVE AH IN CREATING A CLOSER CONTACT  (fe_03_07231-B-0034)
WITH PEOPLE IT CAN BE BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN IT CAN BE USED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS BUT THAT THAT DEFINITELY IS ONE OF THEM THAT I THINK IT ENRICHES OR HAS THE POTENTIAL  (fe_03_07231-B-0035)
FOR ENRICHING ONE'S LIFE BY KEEPING IN IN UM  (fe_03_07231-B-0036)
AH QUICKER CONTACT YOU KNOW WITH THEM AND I THINK THAT'S VERY POSITIVE  (fe_03_07231-B-0037)

IMMEDIATE FAMILY AND THAT SORT OF THING REGARDING MYSELF PERSONALLY I HAVE ELDERLY PARENTS SO I HAVE TO CALL THEM ON THE TELEPHONE  (fe_03_07231-B-0039)
AH THEY DON'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS OR ANYTHING OR EMAIL UM AND THEY COULD REALLY CARE LESS ABOUT IT SINCE THEY ARE IN THEIR EIGHTIES AH THAT SORT OF THING BUT I MUST SAY THAT UM  (fe_03_07231-B-0040)
NEW RELATIONSHIPS THAT I'VE CREATED I HAVE FOUND PEOPLE UM  (fe_03_07231-B-0041)
THAT I'VE MET THROUGH SOCIAL FUNCTIONS FIRST AND THEN HAVE REALISED THAT THEY ARE DEFINITELY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES SO HAVING THE ABILITY TO CONTACT THEM UM  (fe_03_07231-B-0042)
TAKING ACQUAINTANCES AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT THEM THEN STRENGTHENING A RELATIONSHIP IS CREATING YOU KNOW A MORE ENRICHING KIND OF FRIENDSHIP  (fe_03_07231-B-0043)
UM ON ON MY END AH WHICH I THINK IS VERY POSITIVE  (fe_03_07231-B-0044)
