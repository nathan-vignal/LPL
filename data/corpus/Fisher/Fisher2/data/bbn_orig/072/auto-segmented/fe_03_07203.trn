ASSOCIATES PEOPLE THAT I CONSIDER ASSOCIATES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TRUE FRIENDS  (fe_03_07203-A-0006)

ILLNESSES AND DEATHS IN MY FAMILY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS  (fe_03_07203-A-0018)
AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND OUT WHO MY TRUE FRIENDS WERE  (fe_03_07203-A-0019)
BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE AT ALL TIMES NOT JUST WHEN IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR THEM  (fe_03_07203-A-0020)
UM I KNEW I COULD PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THEM ANYTIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT AND THEY WOULD BE THERE FOR ME AS SOON AS THEY FOUND OUT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED THEY WERE HERE  (fe_03_07203-A-0021)
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU REALLY HAVE A TRUE FRIEND THAT CAN SEE YOU AT YOUR WORSE  (fe_03_07203-A-0022)

AND IT IT THEY WERE THERE I MEAN IT THEY WERE THERE FOR ME I COULD CRY WITH THEM I COULD SCREAM WITH THEM I COULD JUST  (fe_03_07203-A-0028)
GO CRAZY BECAUSE THEY WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT ME FOR WHAT I AM  (fe_03_07203-A-0029)
AND FOR WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH AND LET ME REACT TO IT THE WAY I NEEDED TO REACT TO IT WHEREAS SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT I ASSOCIATE WITH  (fe_03_07203-A-0030)
WERE CONSTANTLY SAYING WELL YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT YOU NEED TO MOVE ON  (fe_03_07203-A-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07203-A-0032)
OH  (fe_03_07203-A-0033)
AND YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAD PEOPLE THAT I THOUGHT WERE  (fe_03_07203-A-0034)
FRIENDLY ASSOCIATES  (fe_03_07203-A-0035)
THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE THERE FOR ME  (fe_03_07203-A-0036)
THAT I NEVER HEARD FROM  (fe_03_07203-A-0037)
NOT EVEN A CARD AND THEN WHEN I WOULD RUN INTO THEM  (fe_03_07203-A-0038)
THEY WOULD SAY WELL  (fe_03_07203-A-0039)
I DIDN'T CALL BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY  (fe_03_07203-A-0040)
WELL THAT'S WHY HALLMARK IS THERE  (fe_03_07203-A-0041)
IF I HAD JUST GOTTEN A CARD WITH YOUR NAME ON IT AT LEAST I WOULD'VE KNOWN THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT ME  (fe_03_07203-A-0042)
BUT NOT TO CALL BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY NOT TO SEND A CARD I MEAN IT REALLY IT REALLY HURT ME AND LIKE I SAID THAT'S WHEN I REALLY FOUND OUT WHO MY TRUE FRIENDS WERE  (fe_03_07203-A-0043)
AND WHO WERE PEOPLE THAT I WOULD CALL PEOPLE I ASSOCIATE WITH YOU KNOW I MAY OCCASIONALLY HAVE DINNER WITH THEM OR CATCH A MOVIE WITH THEM OR RUN INTO THEM SOMEWHERE  (fe_03_07203-A-0044)
BUT IN TERMS OF KNOWING ANYTIME OF THE DAY OR THE NIGHT I CAN PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL AND THEY'LL BE THERE FOR ME  (fe_03_07203-A-0045)
I FOUND OUT WHO THOSE PEOPLE WERE  (fe_03_07203-A-0046)
AND ON THE FLIPSIDE WHEN I WAS GETTING MARRIED AND PLANNING MY WEDDING I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT I THOUGHT WERE CLOSE FRIENDLY ASSOCIATES  (fe_03_07203-A-0047)
WEREN'T AS CLOSE AS I THOUGHT THEY WERE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T AS UNDERSTANDING ABOUT SOME THINGS LIKE I CAN'T INVITE EVERYBODY TO THE WEDDING  (fe_03_07203-A-0048)
WE'RE HAVING A SMALL INTIMATE FAMILY WEDDING AND THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY GOT MAD BECAUSE I WAS NOT INVITING THEM TO THE WEDDING  (fe_03_07203-A-0049)
WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE SAID LOOK I TRULY UNDERSTAND I KNOW YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07203-A-0050)
I JUST WANT TO  (fe_03_07203-A-0051)
LET YOU KNOW THAT I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_07203-A-0052)

SO THE OTHER ONE CAME HE SAID LOOK WE'LL GO TOGETHER AND WE'LL PUT THE FLOWERS ON THEN WE WENT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND WE CAME BACK BUT PEOPLE JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN BE HOW YOU CAN SAY YOU'RE GOOD FRIENDS WITH A MAN AND THERE'S NOTHING SEXUAL ABOUT IT  (fe_03_07203-A-0070)
AND I I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT AND MY HUSBAND WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACT HE HAD A LOT OF WOMEN FRIENDS  (fe_03_07203-A-0071)
I HAD A LOT OF MEN FRIENDS AND PEOPLE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME BEING FRIENDLY WITH MEN  (fe_03_07203-A-0072)
OR HOW I COULD UNDERSTAND HIM BEING SO FRIENDLY WITH LADIES AND I SAID YOU KNOW IT COMES DOWN TO A MATTER OF TRUST  (fe_03_07203-A-0073)
AND UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPORTANT FRIENDSHIPS ARE TO PEOPLE  (fe_03_07203-A-0074)
I MEAN 'CAUSE SOMETIMES THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU JUST NEED TO TALK TO A MALE FRIEND ABOUT  (fe_03_07203-A-0077)

I JUST NEEDED A MAN I NEEDED TO FEEL A MAN'S ARMS AROUND ME  (fe_03_07203-A-0079)
AND I KNEW I COULD GO TO THIS FRIEND AND HE WOULD PUT HIS ARMS AROUND ME AND HE WOULD COMFORT ME AND I KNEW I COULD TRUST HIM TO DO IT AND NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION  (fe_03_07203-A-0080)
AND THAT WAS REALLY GOOD I MEAN THAT REALLY HELPED ME TO MAKE IT THROUGH I CAN SIT AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT WHAT I WAS FEELING ABOUT MISSING MY HUSBAND AND  (fe_03_07203-A-0081)
AND SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL THINGS THAT I WAS FEELING THAT PROBABLY ONLY A MAN COULD UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_07203-A-0082)
