L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hi.  I'm Michelle.
L:  I'm Corey. 
R:  Hi.  I'm from Long Island, New York.
L:  Oh.  I live in Queens.
R:  Oh.  Not that far away.
L:  No. [LAUGH]  
R:  Uh.  What do you prefer?  Eating at home or eat in a restaurant?
L:  Uh, [SIGH] I prefer eating in restaurants.
R:  So do I.
L:  But -- but, uh ...  [LAUGH]  I probably shouldn't eat out nearly as much as I do.  
R:  Me too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I love not having to shop for it, cook for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love to be served.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not have to do the dishes.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and so it's a little extra money, a little extra calories.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Mm.
L:  I've been trying to cook at home a little more lately.  Um, just 'cause my husband's trying to lose some weight and -- and, you know, now I have two little kids and it's getting harder to go out with them but, I don't know, I -- I -- he stays home and I work and when I get home it's like [MN] --
R:  Oh.
L:  Who wants to start with cooking and ...?
R:  Oh, he doesn't cook for you then?
L:  Well, once in a while but he's more like, you know, just getting through the day with the two kids.
R:  Yeah, it's not easy.
L:  And -- and ...
R:  How old are your children?
L:  Uh, one is three and a half and one is five months.
R:  Congratulations.  
L:  Thank [LAUGH] you. 
R:  Oh.  
L:  So ...  Yeah, my son is -- is three and a half year.  My husband's been staying home since he was born and cooking seems to be one of, like, the last priority so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we go out a little --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- too often.  
R:  Cleaning would have been my least favorite --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- priority.  That's always the bottom.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that kind of falls by the wayside here too.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, I'm at the [MN] -- opposite end of the spectrum because I've got the grandchildren.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I've got, uh, my daughter's gonna have her third in July and then two years old and four years old.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, uh, I love going out to eat.  And I love taking them out to eat.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not sure what my perfect meal would be.
L:  Oh.  I don't know either.  I mean, uh, I like almost every kind of food.  Uh, you know, there's -- there's not too many things I don't like.  And, uh ...
R:  I've been really having great times with the Chinese buffets.
L:  Yeah, we've been doing a lot of that too.
R:  Yeah.  Because that's terrific with the kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because whatever they like it's there and sometimes they have like even the shrimp with some of the American type of food.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Mac and cheese.  [LAUGH]  My son eats a lot of mac and cheese.
R:  [MN]  That and hot dogs are my grandson's two favorite foods in the whole word.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  They were over visiting this weekend and he -- I said, "What do you like to eat?"  He said, "Uh, I like meatballs and spaghetti".  I said, "You mean you don't like hot dogs and mac and cheese?"  "Oh, those are my two favorites, Grandma".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  So, yes, a lot of mac and cheese.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Well, my son, on the buffet, he'll eat crab legs which is [inaudible] --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- funny.  But it -- it's good -- that's another reason we order buffet.  At least they're free.  I don't have to order [LAUGH] him crab legs and pay for them.  
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, they're free when, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most of the time they don't charge us for him.  If they saw what he was gonna eat they would probably [LAUGH] charge us.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause he --
R:  I guess it goes by height.  They pay -- charge --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now for my grandson 'cause he's four.  But then he's pretty tall.  But for the two year old they look at her and say "Hm".  [LAUGH]  And she's --
L:  How much can she eat?
R:  Yeah.  And she does but, yeah.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.
R:  And -- and -- and I guess [inaudible] it counts down on your eating and my eating because we're taking care of them.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- everything to peeling the shrimp and now we're at the stage where "I -- I'll peel my own shrimp".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, my other favorite kind of meal would be all desserts.
L:  Oh.  
R:  I'm a dessertoholic.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm a chocoholic.
L:  I like choc- chocolate's my thing too.  Definitely.  
R:  And like when they used to have the restaurants with the, um, you probably -- I don't know if you remember Cookie's Steak Bar?
L:  No.
R:  Steak Club?  It was a, uh, steak restaurant but had a salad bar and dessert bar and you had your meal.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  
R:  You know, just like Beef Steak Charlie.  I don't know if you remember that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Use to have that --
L:  That I remember.  
R:  I used to say, well, for Cookie's, forget the meal I'll dabble in the -- the -- the salad bar, because they had nice different salads.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But the dessert, I'll take one of each please.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then if they have my favorite I came back for seconds.  That was when I was young and thing too, though.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And see and dessert is about the only thing that I really enjoy cooking.  You know, I-- I'll cook if I have to and I can follow a recipe but as for main courses I -- I always seem to make the same few things.  But if --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, I -- I --
R:  Someone asked --
L:  -- like making desserts but the problem is, you know, then you eat them and ...
R:  Yeah.  The desserts, you make it and it lasts usually more than just one time.
L:  Well, yeah.  
R:  Yeah, so when you cook the meal even though if you've cooked tons and tons it's over.  You know, you eat it.  It takes so long sometimes to cook it than it is to eat -- eat it.
L:  Yeah.  It drives me crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have trouble coming up with things to cook.  You know, rather than always make the same few things.  And ...  I have probably ten cookbooks and I always seem to make the same couple a things.  
R:  Yeah, with -- with chicken there's so much you can do with it.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  But I -- I +guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess you're not in a house.  You're in an apartment?
L:  Yeah.  I'm in apartment.
R:  Okay, so you don't have the barbecue at your fingertips either, then?
L:  No.  Exactly.  And that's what I -- I tell -- a lot of times I wish I had a barbecue.  
R:  Mm.
L:  You know.  And we also have a very small kitchen so it's -- we don't have a lot of counter space so it's frustrating, you know.  You want to make something and it's like I have no room.  I have no -- no space to work, you know.
R:  Uh.  That --
L:  And no dishwasher.  So then you make --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- all these dishes and it's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- now we spend an hour cleaning up.
R:  Hopefully you'll move to a -- a house in the foreseeable future.
L:  Yeah.  Hoping that happens in a few years.
R:  If -- if -- if you wanted.  Some people -- I have a cousin who never wants to move from Queens.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, you know, I like it here a lot but the -- the prob- -- the thing -- we're in a co op, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, we own it but at the same time all of the, uh, maintenance and everything is taken care of and, you know.  I'd love to be in a house but I don't think we're ready for one right now.
R:  Yeah.  It's a lot of work.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And I -- I'm handy but my husband really isn't.  And he doesn't enjoy handiwork and gardening and anything like that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so ...  He says he doesn't want a house until he can pay someone to do all that stuff for [LAUGH] him.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Take a while.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think it's gonna be a long time.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'll see.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  We're the opposite.  My husband's handy and he loves to do that kind of stuff so ...  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I just love to eat.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, uh ...  [MN]
L:  Tonight I was very lazy about food.  My husband went out to a Yankee game and I -- I didn't even eat anything yet because I -- I just have no, uh, I don't know, I didn't feel too good today.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So usually when he goes out I take my son for Chinese food which he never eats.  You know, just one of these little places on the block.
R:  Right.
L:  And I didn't feel like it so I gave him mac [NOISE] and cheese and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm still sitting here, like hm, just don't know what I [LAUGH] want.  
R:  And these calls always come perfect during my dinner hour.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So whenever they call I say to my -- to my husband, "I'll see ya in ten minutes".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  Would a been nice when the kids or if we had company, someone who would a talked to him.  So he puts -- he opens the newspaper and he reads as he finishes eating.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, I guess I'm also lucky because my husband does cook.  He does -- he -- be- besides barbecuing he'll -- when I get frustrated he'll, you know, just to b- to broil the fish or to bake the chicken or the something.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So ...
L:  See my husband will cook if you tell him --
R:  What to do.
L:  We- well, he'll -- if he'll make -- uh, he'll bro- stick something in the broiler.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then he doesn't really think about anything to go with it.  
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, and -- and he'll -- he'll do great and he'll broil a piece of fish or meat or whatever and then you say, "Well, what are we --"
R:  But you gotta tell them --
L:  "-- having with it?"  "Oh, I don't know".
R:  Yeah, I tell -- you put -- do the rice.  You do the stuffing or the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pasta.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  
R:  Mm.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, uh -- well, on the restaurants.  And we're in a very good area where there are so many, right?
L:  What part of Long Island are you in?
R:  Um, I'm in Suffolk County over by Stoneybrook, Port Jefferson?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And even where you are, Queens, [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the whole area's so many restaurants.
L:  Yeah.  And we go out to, like, Nassau County a lot 'cause my husband grew up there.  His parents live there so ...
R:  Oh.  Where in Nassau.
L:  What?  Plain View?
R:  Okay.  I grew up in Massapeekwa[?].
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, yeah, so I mean, we're nearby so many things and ...  
R:  Yeah, my daughter lives in --
L:  It's always so easy to just to "Ah, let's go out tonight".  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's so much -- it -- it tastes better.  It does.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  I -- I think it [LAUGH] tastes better.
L:  [LAUGH]  We have a diner, um, you know, two blocks from us walking distance so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just spend way too much time at.  And, uh, I've been bringing my -- the kids there -- well, since my son was a couple a days old and they all know him and they, you know, they treat him special.  They bring him cookies so ...  You know, it's nice to go there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's almost like eating at home except it costs us, uh ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  A lot more.
L:  A lot more.  
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  But, uh, I guess as long as we keep our health and we're -- enjoy what we doing.  Whether we eat home, we eat out, let us just be with the people we love.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's the most important thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And maybe we -- each have a delicious dessert tonight.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm already thinking [MN] Baskin and Robbins hot fudge sundae.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Funny, I told my son, uh, 'cause he kept telling me, "We go out that Chinese food".  And I was telling him not tonight.  And I said, well, you know, if you eat your dinner here and then maybe later we'll go over to Baskin Robbins.  
R:   [MN]
L:  We have one right around the corner too so ...
R:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, we have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to drive to get to anyplace.  
L:  Yeah.  See that's what's nice about over here too.  We're right off Queens Boulevard.  It's like a block and a half from Queens Boulevard so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- really we can do a lot of things without moving the car.
R:  Oh, yeah, you -- you just put the baby in the stroller and you push.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Just walk, you know.  Everything's walking so ...  I mean, we will take the car --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if we're going further but it's nice sometimes to just be able to walk and get a slice of pizza or ...
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  You know.
R:  We can do that too if we don't mi- -- the -- mind the m- mile to two miles walk.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  To -- to get there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Not quite the same.
L:  No.  I -- I think that's why my husband likes it here so much because he said putting -- putting them both in the car now is, uh, more of a pain than anything. 
R:  Oh.  
L:  So --
R:  The car seats.  Yeah.
L:  -- to be able to walk and, you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, the car seats and -- they're both in car seats so ...
R:  Yeah.  Uh ...
L:  It's hard.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I -- I guess that being Grandma now I'm getting the experience where we didn't have this like -- you're probably about the same age as my children.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And car seats weren't like that.  How old are you?
L:  Yeah.  I'm thirty two.
R:  Okay.  My dau- older daughter's thirty two.  
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  My [inaudible] --
L:  My mom says the same thing.  "Oh, with these car seats --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- and we didn't have
