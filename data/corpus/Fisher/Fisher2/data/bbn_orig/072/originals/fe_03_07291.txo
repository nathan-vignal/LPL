L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm -- hello.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi, I'm Lisa.  
R:  Hi, Lisa.  I'm Christy.
L:  Hello.  My mom's name's --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- Christy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, is it really?  Cool.
L:  So is my sister in law so ...  [LAUGH]  I know --
R:  Pretty good.
L:  -- lots of Christy's.  
R:  Um --
L:  What am I doing?
R:  I gotta -- I gotta warn you I'm on a cellphone so hopefully --
L:  Oh, that's okay.  I gotta warn you --
R:  Hopefully --
L:  -- I've got a crying and hungry baby so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Well, that's cool.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Where are you from?
R:  Now let's see.  Um, Runic[?], Virginia.
L:  I'm sorry, where?
R:  Runic, Virginia.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Oklahoma.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Oklahoma City to be exact.
R:  That's pretty far.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Fixing to get some bad weather.  
R:  Oh, no.  We've had rain for the past three weeks.  I'm tired of rain.  
L:  Oh, we're used to it out here [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Are you really?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Tornadoes and everything but luckily today it doesn't look like there's any tornadoes.
R:  Well, thank goodness.  I saw some, I think, near --
L:  Seventy -- seventy mile per hour winds so ...
R:  Gosh.  I think Nebraska was maybe hit by some recently, I'm not certain though.
L:  Yeah, we had -- we had a really bad tornado just May eighth, this year.  Struck about --
R:  You didn't get hurt or lose anything?
L:  No it struck about, hm, four miles from my house.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Real close.
R:  That's close.
L:  Too close.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's pretty scary.  
L:  That's too close.  I think they said restaurants.  Do you like eating at a restaurant or at home?
R:  Well, you see, I -- I guess --
L:  I love eating out.
R:  -- I like -- I do too.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Just because there's less work involved.
L:  My husband hates it but ...
R:  Well, yeah, 'cause th- they usually have to pick up the bill.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  He -- he'd rather have a nice home cooked meal but me I just -- I love to go eat out.  I love Mexican food.  That's my ...
R:  Hey, that's my favorite too.
L:  [MN]
R:  We have a --
L:  I love Mexican food.  
R:  We have a lot of Mexican restaurants here and they put out these coupons in the phonebook for buy one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- get one free.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So everytime I go --
L:  I've heard on the -- on the -- on the east coast they don't have -- like I'm in Oklahoma and so, you know, we're pretty close to Texas and Mexico, so we have pretty much authentic restaurants here.  I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they have 'em over there.  I've heard that they're not as authentic over there, like on the east coast or whatever.  I've heard [NOISE] --
R:  Well ...
L:  -- members live up in the north east and are like, "Oh, we can't find good Mexican food up here".  [LAUGH] 
R:  It -- it -- it is kind of a job.  I mean, it's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- definitely not as authentic.  It's more of Americana.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  So it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not --
L:  Well, my husband met -- my husband's Hispanic so, you know, I try to make like tamales and ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  He loves it when I -- he loves it when I make those.  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're good.  But, yeah --
L:  So ...
R:  -- we definitely need more +authentic -- authentic food here --
L:  Yeah, I've heard that.  
R:  -- on the east coast.
L:  I have some family that live out that way so ...  But ...
R:  But that's -- that is my favorite as well. 
L:  I love to eat out.  I love to --
R:  So do I.
L:  -- eat out.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, you know, sometimes --
L:  Every once in a while my husband will like to go out and go out to eat, but every once in a while.  We have two kids so it's kinda hard to ...
R:  I bet that is hard 'cause especially when they're real little.  Then you got the --
L:  Yeah, my son is four, almost five.  And my daughter's nine months.  
R:  Wow.  So that's quite --
L:  So ...
R:  -- an adventure getting the car --
L:  Oh, I tell you.  
R:  -- packed and ...
L:  [LAUGH]  I tell ya.  
R:  Yeah, but fortunately --
L:  But I -- I like --
R:  -- I -- I don't have any children so ...
L:  Oh, you don't?
R:  Not yet.  Hopefully not --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- anytime soon but ...
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, well it's -- it's a bunch of fun but it's -- it's tiring and ...
R:  Oh, I can imagine.  
L:  You can kiss your romantic dinners for two goodbye, for sure.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  [inaudible].
L:  We kissed those bye a long time ago.  But we used to go out --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all the time before the kids were born.  You know, he'd always take me out, but really ever since the kids were born we don't go out to eat as much.
R:  Well, it changes -- it changes a lot.  Everything from how long it takes you to go because you can't leave 'em by --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- themselves.  And you have to pay for --
L:  I know.
R:  -- a sitter if you do go and ...
L:  Well, it's getting easier 'cause my daughter's getting where she can sit in a high chair now so we don't have to --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- carry in the big infant carrier and ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  As they get older it gets easier to take 'em out 'cause you don't have to take out everything in your house in your diaper bag.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I agree.  Yeah.  Although I wouldn't know but --
L:  Whenever and if you have kids you'll -- you won't carry your purse anymore.  You'll carry a diaper bag.
R:  Oh, geez.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  A lot of my girlfriends that have kids have -- they're always wanting me to carry it for them.  So like --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- here you need to get used to this.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  'Cause --
R:  [inaudible] I really don't want to get used to it until I have --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it's like the first one, like, it's true.  They'll tell you like the first one you'll throw everything in there.  You know.  You'll have every possible thing that you could possibly need for that baby when you're out.  But like the second, third, fourth one, it's like [MN] the bare [LAUGH] necessities.  
R:  [MN]  It gets --
L:  Diapers, wipes --
R:  -- more --
L:  -- formula.  You know, whatever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It gets more +lackadaisical.  
L:  I'm telling you it's -- still have to take out a whole bunch of stuff but luckily as they get older it's easier to go out to eat.  Not as quiet but ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  True.  
L:  Not as quiet.
R:  But sometimes it is nice to eat at home though and save [MN] whatever money that you could've spent eating out and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at least know that what you're putting in it could be healthier too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because when you eat --
L:  That's --
R:  -- out you don't really know --
L:  Yeah, that's my --
R:  -- what you're getting.
L:  -- thing.  I -- I'm trying to eat better and everything and it's hard with two kids.  And then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you go out, you know, I love like the enchiladas and the tamales and ...
R:  I know, but they're so fattening though.
L:  I know.
R:  That's 'cause --
L:  The rice, the refried beans.  Oh, man.
R:  Yeah, I like the, um, cheese dip with the jalapenos.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  On the -- oh, man --
L:  That is so good.
R:  -- that stuff's so awful.  It's just, uh --
L:  I know.
R:  -- grease, wafer[?] and fat.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I love it.  
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's some awful stuff but I treat myself to it every once in a -- every once in a while.
R:  Oh, I do too.  I -- I probably go out and eat Mexican on average about once a week.
L:  Yeah.  It's about how we do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  My mom is my eating out buddy though.  My husband doesn't go out to eat very much.  But me and my mom, we're always going out to eat.  We drag out the kids and we go eat.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's good.  That way it gives you time to spend with her too.  
L:  Yeah.  We -- we usually go to Mexican restaurants.  Sometimes we'll go to steakhouses.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Or buffets.  We only really have two buffets, besides Chinese buffets.  
R:  Gosh, we have a ton of buffets here. 
L:  Really?  I mean --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- there's like pizza buffets and there's, you know, Chinese buffets but, I mean, like Go- we have Golden Corral.  I don't know if you have that where you are.
R:  We do.  We have two of those.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  We have -- we have several -- several different ones across the city but it's just like there's two main chains.  I think the other one's Hometown Buffet.  
R:  Huh.
L:  That's like a buffet place.
R:  We've got like an Old Country buffet.  I think --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that might be a chain.
L:  And those are evil too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, with all --
L:  As far as weight wise.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  We -- anytime you eat out really.  I mean, they just --
L:  I know.
R:  -- load it with fat and salt. 
L:  Oh, I know.  Like I was -- 
R:  I mean, the salt and --
L:  -- seeing the new [MN] -- the new McDonalds salads they have.  I was reading -- I was watching CNN and they said that they have as like as much fat as some of the burgers.
R:  Really?
L:  And with --
R:  I guess with maybe because of the salad dressing?
L:  The -- yeah, the dressings on 'em.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And the chicken.  The breaded chicken.  It's really high --
R:  I haven't --
L:  -- fat.  So ... [LAUGH]  
R:  I haven't tried any of those.  
L:  I haven't either but I was listening.  I was like, wow, as much as a hamburger.  You should just go ahead and have a hamburger.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Get the hamburger.  Yeah.  If you're gonna get it you might as well enjoy eating it.
L:  A big juicy hamburger.  
R:  Wow.  That's pretty interesting.  I -- I haven't been to McDonalds in a long time.  So ...
L:  Oh, I take my son all the time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  He loves --
R:  Uh, well the kids --
L:  -- McDonalds.
R:  -- love it.  They do 'cause they get to have --
L:  He loves --
R:  -- the play -- playground.
L:  Oh, I know.  I think --
R:  Happy meals.
L:  -- that's where I'm gonna have his birthday party this year, as a matter of fact.  Is at McDonalds in September so ...
R:  Well, how neat.  I have a friend that actually works in architecture and he designs those little playgrounds.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh.
R:  Wouldn't that be --
L:  That's a good thing.
R:  I think -- I think's that an awesome job.
L:  Yeah, that would be neat.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So he determines how they -- which way they go and does the safety regulations for 'em and like, well, you know, I guess if you had to have a job in architecture that's probably just as good a job as any.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Designing playground stuff.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love their playground stuff.  It's so -- like we go to this one, it has like everything.  I mean, it's huge.  It's like has something for like even if the kids are like -- some kids are afraid to go up high.  My son was at first and they have like smaller ones for 'em and ...
R:  Yeah.  And then the slides on 'em.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  He's just now got to where he goes down slides and stuff.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, has he?
L:  I have a little wuss for a son.  [LAUGH]  That's what my sister says.  
R:  Well, that's cool.  At least he's doing it.  
L:  Oh, I know.  He's scared of a lot of things.  Like dogs.  He hates dogs.  And 'course my --
R:  Well, dogs --
L:  -- husband doesn't like dogs either.  
R:  Yeah, they can be kinda scary, especially when they're big ones.  
L:  Oh, I know.  He's -- I mean, he's like -- he used to be terrified of anything that moved.  [LAUGH]  Flies.  He's still terrified of flies and ...
R:  I've got a -- a nephew terrified of, um, escalators.  He thinks the teeth are gonna come eat him.
L:  [LAUGH]  My son --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- loves those.  That's one thing he loves.  Is those escalators.
R:  Does he really?
L:  He loves them.
R:  My nephew's --
L:  He loves going up and --
R:  -- afraid of 'em.
L:  -- down 'em.  [LAUGH] 
R:  He won't go near those things.  He's afraid it's gonna eat him.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, they can be dangerous if you -- you, you know, have strings hanging out of your coat or something.  I heard kids got --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like strangled or something.  I always watch --
R:  But he'll --
L:  -- him when he's on there though.  
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  If -- if he fall I guess it could be kinda disastrous.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you have to watch him on those.  So do you --
R:  Well, that's cool.
L:  -- do this -- this speech things often?
R:  Uh, this is actually the second call that I've had.
L:  Mine too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I think -- I think we can only do three.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And then boot us out.  Yeah.
L:  Did you sign up on the internet?
R:  I did.  
L:  I did too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  See I don't want to get a second job.  [MN]  I do these surveys and stuff like that to help supplement it.  
L:  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's good I -- well, I stay at home with the kids so I'm on a lot of lists online, like email lists.  Like freebie lists and ...
R:  Like was that our ...?
L:  I enter all kinds of -- I do --
R:  Did you hear a tone?
L:  -- Greenfield online and ...
R:  I do Greenfield too.  And, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- survey savvy.  
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Have you gotten --
R:  That is really good.
L:  -- anything from survey?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Survey savvy?  I've not gotten anything from them yet.  
R:  Well, they're --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- awesome.  I've done --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- two -- I've done two surveys and each one paid thirty.  
L:  Wow.  
R:  That -- I mean, even though you --
L:  I did a survey for Greenfield online once and they paid me thirty.  It was like a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was a panel thing where you got together with a whole bunch of other people and talked about something for like thirty minutes.  But I've only --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- done one of those.  
R:  Yeah, they're -- they're neat and, um, if you ever did a time cone research invitation.  Time cone
