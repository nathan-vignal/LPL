R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, [COUGH] this is Gerard. 
L:  Yeah, hi, I'm Cindy. 
R:  Hi, Cindy.  Hey, um, [MN] I guess we should just start right in, um --
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] awkward, isn't it?
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, well I -- as a gay man I have, you know, quite a few very close friends.  My best friend and I consider to be -- a -- my sister, I -- I don't have any -- any brothers or sisters, so she is like a sister to me, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we know each other inside and out.  We've known each other w- w- -- it's one of those -- we -- we -- we always say, we've known each other twenty years too long.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, go- --
L:  One of those people you've known forever, I can tell. 
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Even before you knew them, you knew them.  I -- I know the type. 
R:  Yes. [PAUSE] [SIGH] Um, oh, we, hey, w- -- oh, we -- we don't always agree on everything, but we agree on most things and -- and on what, ah, what guy is -- is nice, what, you know --
L:  Mhm.  One of those friends that, ah, you think each other's thoughts, it sounds like, 'cause I've been there too.  Ah, I kind of miss that now, but I did have that, where we finish each other's sentences or don't because we know what she's thinking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- before she says it.  No, I know --
R:  [NOISE] Hey, ah, the type of friend where you could be, oh, talking with them on the phone, oh, and -- and say something and -- and say, "Don't look at me with that tone of voice".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you know each other that well that you can imagine the reactions, I know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  To see the eyes rolling and, you know, y- you hear it, but you see it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes. 
L:  Yep. [PAUSE] 
R:  Ah, [MN] ah, ah, then I have -- have quite -- quite a f- -- um, a lot of acquaintances though.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, people that I consider friends but, hey, don't know, you know, I know them but really, but not really.
L:  On a more minor le- -- minor level they're friends --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- yeah, I know.  I used to home school and I had quite a few friends that are on that level.  Because we all home schooled, but that was pretty much all we had in common and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you run into them in the grocery store and you're gonna say, "Hi", and talk for about three seconds and -- and really, you have nothing to talk about --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unless it's school.  So these are [MN] acquaintances not friends, I agree.  
R:  "Hey, um, how's the weather?", how -- um, if you -- if you knew them a little bit, er, better than how's the weather, like, "How's mom and dad?  Oh --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- oh, sorry to hear about that".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or, "Glad to hear -- hear this", things like that.
L:  Oh, sure.  I've -- I'm thinking of one person in particular that the last time I saw her it was like, "Hi", we ran into each other in the grocery store and it was, like, "Oh, good, somebody I know", and all I could talk about was how her mother is.  I've never met her mother.  I just know her --
R:  Right.
L:  -- mother lives with her.  I don't know her [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- but, obviously I have nothing to talk to you about.  Mm.  
R:  [MN]
L:  It's hard when you feel, like, I'm supposed to be friendly, but I have nothing to say. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Or --
L:  So you just look real friendly.  
R:  [inaudible] Hey [SIGH] [inaudible] then -- then you have -- have [COUGH] -- I don't know about you, but I -- I listen to the radio a lot and I listen to -- I watch a lot TV and -- and -- and I don't know -- know, but I -- I can almost say, hey, like, hey, somebody from the television is -- is -- is a friend.  You know, or I -- ah, at least the newscasters are -- are friends --
L:  Mhm, in a sense. 
R:  You -- yeah, you -- you've -- you've, ah, ah, you don't like -- you don't like it when, ah, they change a -- a newscaster or -- or whatever. 
L:  Oh, I know.  You just have this whole of, "Wait a minute, what happened to [MN]?"  I know. 
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- you feel like, boy, am I lame, but [LAUGH] it does, it feels like there's something missing.  Maybe I am that lame, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well.  Talk to my dog too, I guess I must be. 
R:  Oh, r- -- oh, well, dogs at least -- dogs you can tell you -- ah, animals you can tell your deepest darkest secrets to and they'll never tell anybody. 
L:  They'll never tell and they will wag that tail and they'll look at you with tho- those eyes that say, "I care".  When they don't have any idea what you said --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it still feels like somebody's listening to me.  Ah -- that's bad.  I'm -- I'm turning into that old lady with the houseful of cats, except --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- there's only one of them, but I -- I feel that way, 'cause I -- [MN] you don't wanna get up and have a conversation with your dog in the morning, but you feel like you're doing that.  "Hi, how are you this morning?"  Why not, she understands what I'm saying or cares, but you do that.  I don't know, you just have this need to be friendly for some reason. Ah -- poor dog. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah.
L:  Oh, she endures a lot.  
R:  Oh, ah, well I'm -- I don't know if you can tell but I'm -- I'm east coast.  I'm in New Jersey, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, and -- and while, oh, I have a lot of neighbors -- -bors I don't -- I haven't even considered my neighbors -- while -- the people upstairs I consider them a- acquaintances, friends, but ah, n- -- ah, just, "Hi, how're you doing?" and -- and whatever.
L:  Oh, I know.  I [inaudible] yeah, I'm -- I'm in North Carolina and, um, moved here about a year ago --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to this particular town.  I was from about half hour away, big deal, but I don't know a soul in my neighborhood.
R:  Right.
L:  We wave at each other.  "I don't know you".  But [LAUGH] you still -- it feels like you know the lady across the street just because of nothing but [LAUGH] you wave now and then. 
R:  Right.  Right. 
L:  It makes you feel more connected somehow.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Even though you're not connected, it -- it feels like you might be.
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Yeah, um, so, well, you know, it's -- it's [COUGH] at least, you know, the neighbor across the street, hey, if you -- if you're friend- -- when you're friendly with them, you can then say, "Oh, oh, um, ha, what about -- how's the new coup- couple who bought, ah, the house down the block", a- -- you're friendly with them.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Oh, and, you know, that -- friends like that, you know, 'cause -- 'cause, you know, if you're friends with your neighbors a- -- they'll keep an eye out on the house, see if anything's wrong --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if you go on vacation.  And things like that.  That's a g- -- ah, that's a nice friend to have.
L:  Her husband in particular came to mind when you said that, because I'm disabled so I don't do things really easily --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I was out there trying to cut down this dead part of the bush, because the one you have to cut back every year, I'd never owned that type before and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I was out there trying to figure out what do you do with this, and -- and I'm out there h- hacking away at this thing.  He came over, he said -- I don't know him -- he came over, he said, "Would you like to use my hedge clippers?" I said, "Oh, yes, oh, that would be so nice of you".  And he came over with them, he said, "Now, sit down", and he did the whole thing for me.  And I thought, "I don't know you people, but I like you people". [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It just feels like somebody's out there that sees when something goes wrong.  I-- it feels like a friend.  It may not be, but [LAUGH] it feels like it. 
R:  Oh --
L:  It's sad, I don't even know the name of any of these people, right across the street.  I know they have, one, two, three, four, five, six children and a husband and wife.  I don't know any of them.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But I wave at them. [LAUGH] Mm.
R:  [MN] Hey, hey, well, well, oh, that -- those can be a -- your co- [COUGH] ah, what I call coffee friends.
L:  Yes, I suppose you're right.
R:  Yeah, and ye- -- once in a whi- -- you know, if you see 'em, "Oh, how you doing?  Come on over for coffee", and -- and sit and talk about this, that, the other thing, whatever.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, ah, who's doing what in the, ah, in town hall or whatever --
L:  Exactly.  When you -- when you started that sentence, see, I knew where you were going, I suppose, 'cause immediately what came to mind was, can we talk about the city council? [LAUGH] It's, like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I don't just bring that up with people but [LAUGH] somehow I can see him doing it, 'cause we're in the same city, the same neighborhood, facing the same stupid city council, you just feel, like, I need to talk to you, for no reason.  But he's gonna understand and I'm gonna understand him.  That's just kind of a good feeling when you talk to somebody and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you -- you don't know what they're going to say, but you know you're kind of on the same wavelength --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [inaudible] ah, [LAUGH] we just happen to live in the same neighborhood, and I guess that puts us there. 
R:  Hey, th- hey.  Like I said, th- those are -- those are very good friends to have.  Oh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, ah, unfortunately, hey, I've lived in this --
