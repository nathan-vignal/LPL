R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine thank you.  My name's Jeannie.
R:  Hi, Jeannie.  My name's Sonia.
L:  Tania?  
R:  Sonia.  With an S.
L:  Hi, Sonia.  
R:  Where are you located, Jeannie?
L:  I'm in Adrian, Michigan.  What about y- --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What about yourself?
R:  Portland, Oregon.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  We're quite a few miles away from each other then.  
R:  Yeah.  Now, Adrian.  Close to where?
L:  Um, I'm south east -- about sixty miles south east of Detroit.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Um --
R:  Well, I lived in Chicago for about twenty years off and on so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I know the area --
L:  Chicago's about --
R:  -- up there.
L:  Chicago would take me about a good four and a half hours to get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  
L:  So ... Have you done this before?
R:  I've done one before.  How 'bout you?
L:  One and it was --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- months ago.  They --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- seemed to have forgotten about me.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now all of a sudden they're calling.  
R:  Yeah, well, cool.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.  Did you enjoy yourself the first time?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, actually it was a -- but it was a topic that was a little bit more difficult to talk about.  
L:  Right.  Mine was --
R:  It was indoor and outdoor sports.
L:  Oh, mine was reality TV and I don't watch reality TV.
R:  Mm.  No.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So this topic is on friends, I take it.
R:  Right.  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay.  Um, we're supposed to talk about if we have a lot of +acquaintances or friends.  
R:  Well, tell me first of all.  Tell me about your best friend.  
L:  My best friend is Mary.  Um, we've been friends for over twenty years.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my husband and her husband worked together and, uh, we've just been really close ever since.  I mean, she's always there for me.  It doesn't matter the circumstances or, you know.  We work together as well too.  So I see her on a daily basis and, uh, we share a lot in common.  [MN]
R:  What do you do?  What's your profession?
L:  I work in a hospital.  I'm in, um, business office insurance verification.
R:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  
L:  And --
R:  'Scuse me, I've got a cat that when I get on the phone he will try to scratch furniture just to get attention.  
L:  Oh, I have a husband that when I get on the phone he tries --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to aggravate me to get attention.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I don't know if they're pets.  [LAUGH]  Oh, shoot.  Well, you know, I've lived all over the world and, um, you make friends wherever you go and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're all -- they're different kinds of friends.  I think you make friends when you're living in a foreign country out of necessity.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because y- you're just stuck there.  I mean, I was in Saudi Arabia for seven years.
L:  Were you really?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  That would be interesting.  
R:  It was.  And, you know, it's so nice because the friends that I made there, because women can't work and women can't drive you kind of make your own entertainment and it becomes other women.  And, uh, so now I have friends in, uh, Australia and New Zealand and, um, uh, one has just left Kuwait and is now living in, uh, in Cairo, Egypt.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so it's interesting.  I've got Irish friends and -- and, uh, British friends and -- and I think those types of friends that you make, um, in a foreign country y- you keep them for a long time but your connection is tenuous.
L:  Right.
R:  It's -- it's, um, you don't -- you don't talk to them all the time.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, couple a times a year maybe.  Now that email is -- is, uh, [LAUGH] everybody --
L:  Oh, it's wonderful.
R:  -- uses it.  Um, we -- we correspond a lot more than we did when we have to actually write a letter or -- or talk on the phone.
L:  Right.  
R:  So -- so those friends are one type of friend.  And then, like you, I have a friend from high school.  I, um, was new in a high school as a senior and I walked into a social studies class and sat down --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- next to this gal and we have been friends ever since.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was nice.  
R:  Oh, it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- wonderful.  We just got back from a week's trip down to Phoenix, into the Indian Pueblos?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we -- we travel together [inaudible].  She's married.  I'm no longer married.  I was.  But, um, her husband doesn't like to travel so she and I go places.
L:  That would be nice.
R:  Yeah, it's fun.  
L:  Yeah, my husband --
R:  It really is.
L:  -- likes to travel with me so ...
R:  Well, good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Now I had a -- a friend in high school and, uh, we stayed close for years but then as we got older and our families expanded and she moved away, we're not in cl- -- touch with each other as we once were.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're lucky to see each other every, probably, five years.  
R:  Oh.  Well, at least you see each other.
L:  Yeah.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, this friend of mine, Mary, you know, like I said, I've known her for over twenty years and, uh, she's just a wonderful person.  
R:  Oh, it's so -- it's --
L:  You know, I mean she -- it's almost like she can read me.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, so sh- -- her and I are very close and, you know, she's very special to me.  Then I have other friends, you know, that, um, we're friends and we do things together but it's a different relationship.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, I don't share as much with them as I would maybe my other friend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, but I have a -- a good neighbor.  Uh, a good neighbor, a friend that's a neighbor that we've really become close in the last year and I didn't realize how special she was until about a month ago.  My father passed away.
R:  Oh, and that's so hard.
L:  Yes.  And it was -- it's very hard.  And [MN] well, actually it was a month ago, May ninth.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So, it's a month ago today.
R:  I'm sorry, hon.
L:  Um, and it was unexpected and, uh, I -- he happened to pass away on a Friday and, uh, I was over in Ann Arbor.  My sister had flown, um, in the night before just for a long weekend because air -- she got a really good deal on an airline ticket so my mom and my youngest brother and my -- my, um, my sister and I had taken my dad over to a hospital for a routine procedure which he didn't come out of.  Um, but anyways [MN] on Friday nights we always go out together.  We go to a local establishment around here and do some gambling and, you know, and such.  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So they're calling me on the phone, and they're all happy, and they called me and, you know, and a- actually it was her husband and, uh, wanting to know how my dad was and I had to tell him that he had passed away.  Because I was on my way home from, you know, the hospital --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we were at.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And as soon as I got home they were over here and they were trying to cheer me up and instead of going, um, they brought over a scratch off lottery tickets.  
R:  [MN]
L:  'Cause we always gambled on Friday nights.  Brought me over scratch off lottery ticket.  Next day her husband mowed our lawn.  She had made a meal.  I mean, a complete meal to take down to my mother's house 'cause all my siblings and nieces and nephews and that were flying in.  And even came back into town to get more lawn chairs.  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stayed with u- you know, stayed with us that evening to help me with my mother.  Because my mom and her get along real well.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Um --
R:  And you mom probably was a basket case.
L:  Oh, she was.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  She was.  But they did a wonderful job keeping her mind under [MN] you know, off of it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and I -- I guess I didn't realize how special they really were until then.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because they, like, offered to do things and, you know, even -- they've gone to pick my mom up for me so that I could have her here at the house.  Um, you know, they got out of work earlier than I did and they've gone to pick her up for me so that I can have her where I live at, um, for the day and do something with her that day and that evening.  You know, for the weekend.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  They -- they're just so wonderful.
R:  Isn't that fabulous?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Well, you -- you mentioned that you have sisters and brothers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes.  How many?
L:  I have three brothers and two sisters.
R:  Okay.  
L:  I have, uh --
R:  So they kind of rally around and [MN] when you get into a jam like that or something terrible happens?
L:  Right.
R:  You have them to fall back on.
L:  Right.  But, unfortunately, they don't live near me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my sisters -- I have -- both my sisters are in +Colorado.  And actually I thought it was her calling me.  My one sister, because I called earlier and waiting for her return call.  Um, I have two sisters in +Colorado.  Um, in Aurora and one in Castle Rock.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And I have a brother in Morristown, Tennessee.
R:  [LAUGH]  They're scattered.
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then I have a brother in +Colorado.  Um, and then I have a brother that just lives locally. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Round near me.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But he's younger and, um, we -- I mean, I see him and such but we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  
L:  Local siblings.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But you can say they're friends?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so my -- my sib- my sisters are very close.  Very close.
R:  Oh, good.  Well, you're very lucky.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I'm an only child.
L:  Oh.
R:  And when my parents, well, when my mom died first, she was sixty one.  And it was one of those very unexpected things.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's when you really discover who cares and who's there and which people are really your friends.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know.
L:  That is very true.
R:  Mhm.  They just --
L:  And --
R:  -- seem to rise to the occasion.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, one thing I can say about my siblings is, um, my father he -- he was seventy eight when he passed, but he was a very young seventy eight.  Didn't have a wrinkle on his face.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  
L:  And he had just been diagnosed in March with bladder cancer.  
R:  Oh, boy.
L:  So we didn't know the severity of it.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we didn't know how advanced it was.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the procedure we had taken him for was just to do a -- um, just to do a scope and take additional biopsy.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, he was more advanced than what we could've imagined.  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in a way it was a blessing that he spared himself the suffering, as well as us the suffering.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Um, but my sisters, um, have always been very, you know, 'cause I'm the one back here taking care of my parents, basically.  
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Are you the oldest?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Are you the oldest?
L:  Actually I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Well.  
L:  I'm the fourth.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Um, they're --
R:  But you're there.
L:  Yes, I'm the one that's near my parents.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, but, you know, if I needed something they rallied for me.  Um, if it was just a shoulder to cry on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like when I found out my dad was diagnosed with cancer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it was very hard to, you know, it sucked.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  And it's like --
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  -- okay, I'm no caregiver, could I have done something differently?  Well, wha- -- did I see the signs [several inaudible words]?
R:  Yeah, what did miss?  Mhm.
L:  You know.  And the first thing when my sister flew in, my other sister that flew in, 'cause, uh, my oldest one was here with me.  Um,
