R:  You're talking to Venice, California.
L:  Oh, really?  I'm in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Ohio.
R:  You're in Ohio? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hello.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm -- I'm originally from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, me too.  
R:  Oh --
L:  Altoona.
R:  -- where?
L:  Altoona.
R:  What -- oh, Altoona.  I'm from State College.
L:  Oh, you're kidding?  
R:  No.  It's a -- a small world, see that?
L:  Yes, it is. 
R:  Uh, I went to U. of A.[?] and now I work to get here out in California.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I live here.  
L:  I'm amazed[?].  
R:  And you?
L:  Um, I -- I grew -- well, I lived in Pennsylvania and then I moved a couple of different places and we got transferred out here to Ohio, and been here for a long time.
R:  Oh.
L:  About -- about thirteen years.  
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  So ...  But, um, so do you have a lot of friends in California?
R:  Yes, I do.  I've made a lot of friends and I -- in fact, I live with my best friend out here, Nicky.

R:  And, um, we share a room, an apartment, with two other guys.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And, uh-huh.  And, um, it's quite -- it's been really nice.  California's a lot friendlier than the east coast.
L:  Yeah, oh, is it?
R:  Yes, it is.  
L:  I have -- I have a girlfriend that, um, actually moved out to California too.  She lives, um, not far from Los Angeles.  
R:  That's, uh -- I'm not far from Los -- L.A. either.  
L:  Oh, you're not?
R:  No.  
L:  Oh.
R:  I actually live in Hermosa.  
L:  Um, I can't remember.  Santa Ana? 
R:  Santa Ana?  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  That's where she lives.  
R:  That's a little north of L.A.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And I live south of L.A.
L:  And she actually went to Penn State for a while too.
R:  Oh, I did my first year at Penn State.
L:  Did you?
R:  Yes.  
L:  And so what year did you graduate?
R:  Three years ago in December.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  From the -- um, but I didn't graduate from Penn State.  I graduated from U. of A.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  
L:  So you met a lot of friends there?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, it's -- it's real social here and we have a lot of, um, parties and, uh, volleyball, uh, tournaments on the beach.  And, um, so it's -- it's a very social crowd.
L:  Oh, that's fun.  
R:  Yeah.  It is.  
L:  You can do that --
R:  Um --
L:  -- all year round there.  
R:  Yes, we can.
L:  [MN]
R:  Although right now it's a bit overcast.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yes.  
L:  Well, we're -- we're gonna be getting rain here tomorrow probably but it's gorgeous day today.  But we can't do stuff like that in the winter.  We kinda hibernate and, you now, [MN] friends all seem to get together a lot in the summertime.  We have --
R:  Do you have --
L:  -- great [inaudible].  [COUGH]  Excuse me?
R:  Is your best friend actually living right near you?
L:  Uh, actually, um, I have, um, best friends from growing up from, you know, school in Pennsylvania that I communicate with, um, every once in a while.  But I don't, you know, one's in California and the other one's still in Pennsylvania.  But I have a really good friend in Ohio and she just lives, like, two miles up the road.  
R:  Oh, good.  
L:  Yeah.  And she's, you know, we been really good friends for, oh, nine years now.  
R:  And how did you meet?
L:  Um, at a place I was working.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Actually.  Yeah.  Um, it's -- we just, you know, became friends.  We weren't in the same department or anything.  We just, um, you know, got together and started mingling for lunch and stuff and became really good friends.  And she's always lived in this area so she's introduced me to a lot of people in the area.  
R:  Well, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  We have like neighborhood parties all the time and stuff like that.  In fact --
R:  Mhm.
L:  In fact, I'm getting ready to have one next week for my husband who's gonna be fifty.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  
L:  So ...  [MN]  And your --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- friends?  Do you have kids?
R:  No.  I'm only twenty two.  
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yes.  
L:  I see.  
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  Um, no, I'm not married.  I'm in a relationship that'll, um, be a year in July.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, he's my best friend.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's -- that always works out good when that happens.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, it is.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that [inaudible].
R:  And, um, he's, um, twenty nine.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And I'm -- yes, and I'm twenty two.
L:  I mean, that's a age difference.  
R:  Oh, it's not that much.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.  He- he's a lot of fun and we, um, do a lot together.  We're -- see each other just about everyday.
L:  Do you?  He's not one of the guys that lives in the apartment with you?
R:  No.  
L:  No?
R:  No.  Uh, he has his own place.  He shares an apartment with four guys.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  California's v- very expensive.  
L:  Yes, I know.
R:  So ...
L:  I know.
R:  Very expensive.  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  So everybody, um, pretty much shares a place with someone.
L:  Oh, I know.  Um, I -- my friend that moved down there is, you know, they're by -- well, they're my age and they really want to buy a house and it's so expensive --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [COUGH] to get what, you know, the -- anything that [several inaudible words] to make anything of it.  
R:  Oh, for sure.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  What we would consider, um, my home I grew up in -- in [inaudible], um, is a huge house.  It's almost nineteen hundred square foot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, in comparison to out here, um, that house would make you, um, would put two or three of these inside of that.
L:  Oh, sure.  
R:  For the same price.
L:  Oh, I know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- I know it's very expensive.  So you work?
R:  Yes.  I work for, uh, Patterns, which is a drug and alcohol clinic.  I'm, um, a child development specialist.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I work with the children, although we try to unite the mothers and children.  
L:  Great.
R:  Uh, and we're going -- yes, it is neat.  I love it.  
L:  That's interesting.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Great.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  I'm a mystery shopper.  Well, how did you get involved in this thing?
R:  Oh, you are?  You're a mystery shopper?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I've done that also.
L:  Oh, have you?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I love it.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah.  I do it full time now.  I do a lot of shops.  Work for --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  -- a lot of different companies.
R:  [NOISE]  And who do you, uh, work with out there in Ohio, though?
L:  Um, there's many different companies.  Um, [inaudible] Research.  Checksmart[?].  Texmart[?].  Uh, Bestmart[?].  Um, I don't know.  There's just so many.  I -- I probably have about twenty five different companies I work with.  
R:  Oh, um, I'm -- I meant where do you shop?
L:  Oh, where do I shop?
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, Grocery Rise, Krogers[?], and, uh, Win Dixies[?].  Um, I've done --
R:  Oh, I didn't realize they do that with, uh, um, um, grocery stores.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I've done like Expresses Unlimited and Learners and ...
R:  And that's through Texmart?
L:  Oh, no.  It's through all different companies.  That is --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- actually through A.C.C. Decision.  
R:  Hm.  I never heard of them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, hm.  
L:  I'm very [inaudible] --
R:  That's interesting. 
L:  Yeah, there's a bunch of them out there.  But I have great time doing it.  You know, get to talk to a lot of people and evaluate a lot of people and -- 'course I don't make friends doing that but ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But [MN] -- so do you become friends with, like, any of the kids' mothers and stuff when you're, um ...
R:  Uh, no.  Actually we have to keep a professional distance from, uh, the clients.  They're there anywhere from a month to six months. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, yes.  And they bring their children so it's a process where, um, by we teach them parenting skills and, um, all the ac- actual drug and alcohol counselling and those types of things are done by other counsellors.  Um, my charge is strictly with the children.
L:  I see.  
R:  And I work with the, um, um, teaching parenting school -- skills and -- and discipline techniques and, um, those types of things.  
L:  So how old are the children?  From like ...?
R:  [MN]  We just had one born, two weeks old.  Uh, that's two weeks ago.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, up to seven or eight years old.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes.  
L:  Wow.
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  We just had, um, two little girls leave that were adorable.  Um, that were sisters and their mom.  She completed the program and has done really well.  Um, that's one of our success stories.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  They're not all --
L:  Does it stay --
R:  -- successes.
L:  Does it stay successful like all the time or [MN] are they back?
R:  It varies.  Some, um, work and work at the program and they do really good, and some of them do come back and some of them go from our program to other programs.
L:  Uh.  Well --
R:  And it's hard for them, they don't have a real good support network or friendships either.  Um, which is rather sad.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and that's a -- but they've [MN] burnt those bridges on their own.  
L:  Sure.  
R:  So ...
L:  And -- well, their friends were, um, all their friends do exactly what they're doing so ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  They have to get out and make new friends.
R:  Exactly and some --
L:  Getting the --
R:  -- times that's scary.
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of people who'll have a hard time accepting new people.  Especially when it's -- when you're a older person.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's harder to get accepted, you know, as a best friend.  I'm really fortunate that I ran into a best friend, you know, living in Ohio.  'Cause lots of times, you know, you've grown up with those people and they're your best friends.
R:  True.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And then lots of times you leave and -- and you really don't keep many of those friends.  
L:  No.
R:  Like I only have one friend from high school that I'm real good friends with and she now moved out of here to San Diego.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's --
R:  [MN]  She got married and -- married a -- a guy we all went to school with and then she moved to San Diego.
L:  That's nice.
R:  So she's been here, I guess, in June she'll be here a year.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, but other than that [MN] all the other kids that I went to school with, and I went to a big high school and state college, um, I'm not really friends with hardly anybody there.  
L:  Yeah.  But we had a very big graduating class too.  We had nine hundred and seventy six kids in our class but I still managed
