R:  Hi, Chris.  My name is Judy.
L:  Judy, where are you at?
R:  I'm in North Carolina.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Sitting out on the front porch and the lawnmowers have just started.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I was gonna say I'm in North Carolina too, and I can kinda tell from your accent that you were somewhere nearby.  
R:  Oh, really?  I'm in Wilson.
L:  Oh, and I'm in -- I'm near Charlotte.
R:  Oh, are you?  Oh, okay.  Well, uh, I'm a -- I'm originally from up near Ashville, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Uh, I've -- I've got a little bit of the eastern accent and a little bit of the --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a- accent from Ashville.
L:  [MN]  So what kind of -- what kind of barbecue do you eat?  That's the main question.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  We eat the, uh, chop with vinegar base.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's the kind I like too.  
R:  At Farquars[?] and Bills.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we're supposed to talk about friends.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] do you have a lot friends?
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  Well --
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  No, well, actually I have one best friend and lots of acquaintances but, you know, not a whole lot of friends.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I have my best friend and I, oh, gosh, we've been through, you know, [MN] before I was married, before we had kids, before -- we've known each other for so long.  And, you know, it's just -- we don't even -- we live about five hours apart now and we only see each other probably three times a year.  
R:  Oh, that's bad. 
L:  But we talk on the phone every week.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um --
R:  Do you have email?
L:  We do.  
R:  Yeah.  That's great.  
L:  Uh-huh.  And so, you -- you know, but it's -- it's like even though I only see her several times a year it's still like we never left, you know.  We just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- pick right up where we left off.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Did you -- oh, my best friend lives across the street from me. 
L:  Oh, how nice.  
R:  Well, one of my best friends.  I really have three really, really, really good friends.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But this one that lives across the street from me -- in fact, we bought this house so I could be near her.  
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.  Do you ever argue?  [LAUGH]  Or anything?
R:  Never.  Never.  
L:  Oh.  Are so --
R:  We -- we've been -- we've been friends, let's see, I been in Wilson for almost forty years and we've been friends for probably thirty nine years.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, [MN] are -- do all four of you all get along and know each other and ...?
R:  Well, we -- we -- uh, she knows -- they all know each other but they are not friends.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  You know.  They're friends of mine but they're not friends to each other.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, I'm a friend to all three but they are not.  
L:  Right.
R:  Isn't that strange?
L:  Yeah, it is kind of strange.  
R:  Well, I used to work with two of 'em --
L:  Uh-huh
R:  -- and the other -- the girl who's my best friend across the street we go to church together.  
L:  Right.
R:  And so, you know, uh, we have a lot in common.  And then the two girls, I used to work with, uh, Hilda -- I used to work at, uh, Department of Social Services --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she was -- she was a secretary there and she and I were real good friends.  And then the other girl, I used to do some volunteer work and she was a director of the volunteer center.
L:  Right.  
R:  So we became real good friends.
L:  Oh, that's nice that you have, you know, interests like that together and -- and, you know, when you work together you spend so much time together -- 
R:  Right.  
L:  -- that it's -- it's good to have a -- a work friend.
R:  Yeah.  And then I have lots of acquaintances.  I'm a people person.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I have lots and lots of people that I care about and know and ...  But, uh -- and I can [LAUGH] carry on a conversation with anybody.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm kind of antisocial [LAUGH] myself.
R:  Are you?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I'm one of those people that, you know, I just like to -- I stay home and I have my garden and my flowers, and I do volunteer work and all.  And I have, um, you know, my daughter and my husband and -- and we just pretty much are homebodies.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, my family lives away from here and I have my husband and I have one son here and have two grandchildren here.
L:  Oh, well, that's nice.
R:  And I wish I could be friend with my daughter in law and, of course, we get along good but, you know, we're just not friends.
L:  Right.
R:  But I wish we could be.  But, uh, it -- she's just [MN] temper- tempered a little different than I am.
L:  Right.  
R:  But I [SIGH] you know, I -- I don't meet strangers and I -- I'm just a people -- people person.  
L:  Oh, that's wonderful. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's so nice that you have your grandkids there too.  
R:  Yeah, well my grandkids live right across -- well, three houses down across the street.
L:  Oh, how wonderful. 
R:  And --
L:  Gosh, you're so close to everybody.
R:  Yeah.  Um, my son when he got married, I told him, I said, "I'm gonna buy a house next door to you".  And he said, "No, mamma".  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And [LAUGH] so it worked out that this house became up before the one he bought. 
L:  Right.
R:  And we, uh, he actually bought his before we did but, uh, we saw this one [LAUGH] first.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So he can't be --
R:  But it just -- but his best friend lives next door to him too.  
L:  Well, gosh, you all must be so close?
R:  Yeah, we are.  We --
L:  So you get to see your grand- -- how old are your grandkids?
R:  Three and one.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  Yeah, I keep 'em.  My daughter in law's a nurse.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she works three days a week and I keep 'em.
L:  Oh, well, that works out perfectly for them.
R:  Yeah, it does.  
L:  I know that's a huge help to her to know that they're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- close by and -- and safe and +everything with somebody she knows. 
R:  Yeah, and they love my best friend too.  My grandkids do.  Uh, we go over there and she comes over here and we see each other a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, well, I see -- I talk to my friend across the street just about everyday.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I talk to the other two girls at least once or twice a week, and we go out to lunch and supper and different things, you know.
L:  That's nice.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I used to live down the street from my parents but we -- that was just too close.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, it was too close.  And then unfortunately we moved, and now I'm like six hours away from them too.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And that's too far.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, it's because you have to make a big, you know, you can't just go for the day or anything you have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to -- have to plan it and everybody's got to make their plans and spend a couple days and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they --
R:  Well, my -- my parents are both dead and, uh, my husband's parents are too so we -- I have one sister and one brother and we don't get together often.  And my husband is the baby of twelve and there's six of those left and they don't get together.  But I guess that's why we're so close to our friends.
L:  Right.
R:  And our one son.  We have another son that lives in Atlanta and we don't see him very often.
L:  Right.  That's --
R:  He comes home when he can.
L:  Right.  I know that's -- I -- I've been to Atlanta a few times and I just get nervous just driving through there.
R:  Do [LAUGH] you?
L:  It's -- I mean, there's just like so much traffic and just, you know, the planes are landing like practically right on your head, it seems like.
R:  I know.  
L:  So ...
R:  Well, he liv- he loves it down there.
L:  Does he?  That's good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's a lot going on down there.
R:  Yeah.  He's a -- he's a professional musician.
L:  Oh, wow, that's exciting.
R:  Yeah, so he travels a lot so he's not there a lot.  He --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he -- he's gone --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But anyway it's -- it's amazing, uh, how people end up where they do.  
L:  Right.  It is.  
R:  And, uh ... 
L:  Um, my -- my husband and I both work for Phillip Morris.  
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  And, uh, well, I just recently, um, quit a couple years ago just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to say home with my daughter and all.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, so you're -- you're younger than I am.
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I might not sound it but I am.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, so, y- you know, it -- it was -- it was fun, kind of exciting, to move some place new, like, you know, we were -- we were in Virginia before.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I -- I liked --
R:  I- is that where your friend lives?
L:  Um, yeah, she's in Virginia also. 
R:  Oh, what part of Virginia?
L:  She's in, uh, um, Norfolk area.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's a good area.  I like that area.
L:  And my parents are at -- near Williamsburg.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's [MN] -- yeah, it is -- I love that area too.  I love Virginia.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My brother --
R:  I love Ch- -- I love it around Charlottesville.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I went to school in Charlottesville.  It's so beautiful.  
R:  It is beautiful up there.  
L:  And my brother lives in Roanoke.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's not --
L:  So ...  I've got -- but luckily he's not that far, really.  It's only about --
R:  No, it's not.
L:  -- about three hours from here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's always nice to go up to the mountains for a couple days. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you miss the mountains?
R:  Well, I moved away from the mountains when I was so young.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That, uh, I don't really miss 'em.
L:  Oh, you -- don't you?
R:  Yeah, I moved to South Carolina to the beach.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, not on the beach but twelve miles from the beach and ...
L:  Right.  
R:  It's where I grew up.
L:  Well, my inlaws live in, um, Lake Gaston[?].  
R:  Oh, do they?  They don't have live too far from me then.
L:  So that's not too far from you, actually.
R:  No.  Uh-uh.
L:  Um --
R:  It's, mm, about couple a hours.  And I don't think it's a couple a hours, maybe --
L:  No, uh-uh.
R:  -- and hour.
L:  Probably not.  Probably about an hour.  
R:  Yeah.  Up -- up that way.
L:  And we'll probably be heading out to see them pretty soon to spend some time swimming in the lake.  
R:  Oh, right.  That sounds fun.
L:  Yeah.  That's a good summer thing.  
R:  How old's your daughter?
L:  She's, um, seven -- eight.  She's just --
R:  Oh, so you're --
L:  -- turned eight.
R:  -- a stay at home mom.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Uh.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I worked thirty some years.  
L:  Did you?
R:  And then I retired in ninety four.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And I was young when I retired and, uh, I just stay home and fiddle around.  
L:  Well, that's wonderful.  
R:  Miss -- well, since I keep the kids I don't -- I used to go out right much with friends, you know, shopping and doing stuff like that, but we haven't done that in a while 'cause my husband's not been too well so I have to stay here and ...
L:  Right.  Well, it sounds like --
R:  Uh, look after him.  He said I didn't.  But I do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  He just came out on the porch.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, so how many of these calls have you done?
