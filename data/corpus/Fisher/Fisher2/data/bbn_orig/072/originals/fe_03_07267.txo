R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello. 
R:  Hello. 
L:  Hello.  Hi, my name is Anna.
R:  I'm Deb.  
L:  Hi, Deb.  Nice to meet you.  
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Nice to meet you too.  I'm just --
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm at my office so I'm headed out the door so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, well, I guess, let's see.  The q- [MN] -- the question for me really -- really depends.  There are -- there are some days when all I want to do, you know, is just come home and make my own dinner and make it exactly like what I want.  You know.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Don't have to deal with restaurants adding extra things or putting in things I don't want.  But then there are other times that I'm just craving something you can only get at a restaurant.  So it real- -- like everyday is different for me.  I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess the whole experience at a restaurant is -- is more fun than eating at home.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I -- but I have a lot, you know, I live with friends and roommates.  So we have fun if we eat together too.  But [MN] [several inaudible words].
R:  So it's more of a social experience?
L:  What's that?
R:  It's more of a social experience?
L:  Yeah, it's more of a social experience.  That's -- that's what I like about eating.  So I guess I would go wherever it's, you know, wherever the social experience is.  So if my friends go out, I go out.  Or stay in, we'd stay in.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but how 'bout you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Well, [SIGH] nowadays -- I used to cook a lot when my son was living at home.  And, uh, [SIGH] there was a reason to cook and now that's he gone and it's just me, um, anything fast and easy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I love to cook.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I love good food.  But it's, um, I -- I just don't put forward the effort anymore.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  I -- I'm not a good cook.  My mom is really good.  But she never -- I never was really interested in learning.  I don't know why.  It was just never something that I wanted to learn so now that I live on my own I -- I can cook very basic, like things where you just boil water for.  But I wish --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I don't even take the time to learn or to read recipes.  But I wish I did so ...
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Kind of a shame.  But, yeah, my mom definitely cooked when I was little and my -- and my siblings living in the house.  She definitely cooked more than now.  Just she and my dad, they do --
R:  Mm.
L:  They get quick meals.  I know -- or they just have something weird like a bowl of cereal.  You know, dinner is not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a big deal anymore.  The way it used to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- be when we were all home.  [LAUGH]  But usually --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like tonight, this week actually, it's funny that this question comes on this week because it's my birthday and it's three of my friends birthday so every night we're headed out to dinner and --
R:  Oh, what fun.
L:  -- as much as I'm excited for it I know at the end of the week I'm gonna be ready just to sit at home and make something simple and, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Not have to spend money and -- and, you know --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- eat to -- 'cause you know when you go to a restaurant you can't help but to get overly stuffed.  I have a hard time --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- not stuffing [LAUGH] myself.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I'm gonna be ready for a light meal, I think, at the end of this week.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's gonna be crazy.
R:  Well that's -- happy birthday.  
L:  Well, thank --
R:  So ...
L:  -- you.  Uh, yeah, my birthday's tomorrow and tonight I'm --I'm headed out to, um, to celebrate other friend's birthday and on Thursday it's another friend's [LAUGH] birthday.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it's crazy.  
R:  Oh, that sounds like so much fun.  
L:  [MN]  Yeah --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- it will be fun.  Um, what -- what part of the country do you live in?
R:  Oh, I live in Oregon.  
L:  In Oregon.  Oh, wow.  I'm in D.C. so ...
R:  Oh, opposite ends.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Yeah, I know.  The last -- have you done one of these conversations before?
R:  Um, this is the second one.  
L:  This is -- yeah, this is my second too.  Um, and I thought it was just like kind of the east coast but I guess -- 'cause a woman I talked to --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- was from Philadelphia, but I guess it goes -- goes out to every -- around the country.  I didn't know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I didn't know that.  But that's what [inaudible].
R:  The last person I talked to was from Philadelphia too, so that was kinda fun.
L:  Yeah.  I think it's -- well, the study's based there, I guess.  So that's why.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, what else?  What else is the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- question?  There was another part to it.  
R:  Okay, will you s- -- oh, I kind of wanted to get back to the -- the cooking thing so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Your -- your -- your mom cooked elaborate meals?  Is that what you said?
L:  Yes.  Um, y- you know, not every night but very -- but usually we -- every night we'd have something, you know, very balanced.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And a lot of times, you know, she put a chicken in the oven.  I have yet to do that which I just can't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] believe.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm so bad.  But, um, yeah, so ...  And, you know, we would have nights designated as like family night where we couldn't go out or like eat with our friends.  You know, we had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to stay home and eat around the table.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And catch up, I guess.  [LAUGH] Did you do that too?
R:  We did, um, when I was growing up but I really didn't do it with my son.  I was in grad school and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- then working and so we just like -- I would go home and cook dinner and bring it back to my office at the university, and we would bring him back with me after soccer practice and we'd have dinner there.  So it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- really different than -- in my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- growing up experience.  But --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- I still felt it was important to eat dinner together but ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I do too.  And that's why I like -- I live with three other -- three other girls.  Um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we try to do once a week like a family dinner, you know.  [MN]  The four of us sit down because when you get home from work every, you know, everyone just has their own agenda and people just pick and eat something here and eat something there.  And we --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- end up not sitting down and having a nice meal together and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it just -- you just l- like it's -- it's nice to 'cause over dinner is a good time to catch up and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, hear about everyone's day.  It's one of the only --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- times that we have together because we're all real busy with different things but ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But not as busy as you were.  That must have been very hectic.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Having a small son and grad school and working.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I know.  I know but, you know, um, it -- it all worked.  It all worked.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was a lot of fun.  But now --
L:  Yeah.  Good.
R:  -- that I have more time and he's gone it's just like I don't know what to do with myself.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I end up like nibbling.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or just going out to eat by myself.  I don't really like that but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, well.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  If I could be around people, even if I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get to talk to 'em.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Um, sometimes I, you know, I'll -- I'll go to like -- I -- in my house, the way it is, like in my house now with all my roommates, like there's a s- -- a moment where you are by yourself, it's like really rare and it's so nice sometimes if you come in the house and there's no one there.  So sometimes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if I need just time by myself I'll go out by myself.  Bring a book.
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, and sit at a restaurant --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and just get something.  To me it's nice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sometimes to have that.  
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  
L:  But, um, it's just -- it's crazy.  [LAUGH]  Or -- in my apartment these days everyone just --
R:  Well, I can't imagine for a girl -- well, I -- I did right after high school I lived with, um, three of my girlfriends and it was just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a blast.  We had --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so much fun.  
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  But --
L:  -- so -- so much fun.  
R:  It was high energy --
L:  And, uh --
R:  -- though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What's that?
R:  Very high energy.  
L:  Very high energy.  Yes.  And back to the food thing.  Everyone -- no one can believe that we -- we share the groceries.  Like one person will go shopping --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- every Sunday.  And we share everything.  And people can't believe that four people are able to share but we eat so similar, like, we like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, there are certain things that we'll get special for someone.  Like one of my roommates loves pop tarts so we always get her those and no one else eats --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- them but in terms of the other things we all eat, like, exactly the same way.  And so --
R:  Well, that's neat.
L:  -- we sh- -- yeah.  We don't need to like section off the pantry, like my shelf, everyone's shelf like that.  We just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- share -- yeah.  It just works out really well.  And -- and no one eats more than the other.  You know, there's never -- I don't know how we do it.  I guess we all --
R:  [MN]
L:  We all try to eat really healthy.  I guess --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- we, you know, with vegetables and fruit and -- and people just -- we just are good at sharing it, I guess.  
R:  Oh, that's really neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Nice to hear --
L:  It just works -- it works out.  But no one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- can believe it.  They're -- they're all my friends from college.  We've been friends for a couple of years now and, um, we just graduated.  Well, a year ago.
R:  [MN]
L:  So we're out --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- of college living on our own for the first time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  It's [MN] --
R:  So what do you -- what do you do?
L:  Um --
R:  Where do you work?
L:  I work at -- I work -- it's through the government.  It's an organization that deals with women's health and we --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- run a hotline that women can call.  And --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, get -- we set -- can send out free health information.  Refer them to other organizations.  And I do a lot with their Spanish.  
R:  Okay.
L:  With their Spanish stuff because, um, I majored in Spanish at school.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So -- so I can speak it not quite fluently but -- but good enough.  You know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they've -- and sometimes I feel like I'm fluent and sometimes I'm not.  So what do you do?
R:  Mhm.  Well, during the day I work as a planner for, um, a local government.  We work with smaller local governments --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, all over Oregon and then at night I teach, um, statistics at --  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  So I -- I still keep pretty busy but I have more time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my son is in Iraq right now.  
L:  Oh.
R:  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When is he gonna -- Any word on when he gets to come home?  
R:  Well, he was supposed to be home the first part of July but now there's a stop order on marines and he doesn't know when he'll be home.  So ...
L:  Oh, my goodness.  
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I had this big celebrat- celebratory dinner all planned and now I [LAUGH] don't know when I'm gonna be able to do it.  
L:  Oh, no.  Well, you have to make --
R:  But --
L:  -- some huge feast.  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Oh, I -- when he comes home I cook up a storm.  
L:  Really?
R:  So, but when he's gone -- it's like when he comes home then we'll barbecue every night and --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- do things like that but now there's, I mean
