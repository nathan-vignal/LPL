R:  Hi, I'm Star Shadow.
L:  I forgot who I am.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  You forgot who you are?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I haven't been called for a [LAUGH] while so I forgot.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Well, our --
L:  Well, this isn't helping me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, we're supposed to be talking about, uh, let's see, what do we like best?  Eating out or --
L:  Going out to restaurants or eating in?
R:  Yeah.  Me, I -- I --
L:  Yeah, well ... [LAUGH] 
R:  -- pick going out anytime.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Pardon?
R:  I'll pick going out anytime.  
L:  Yeah, I do too most of the time.  It -- it's a lot easier than, uh, trying to eat at home anymore. 
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's a lot more fun, huh?  Oh, w- well, have you -- do a lot of eating out or get to or ...?
L:  Um, I do.  I travel a lot during the day on different days of the week and I go out with my daughter 'cause she always wants to eat out.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  So ...  She's a teenager.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  And then -- just getting out once in a while.  'Cause it's a lot easier I said than making, uh, dinner at home sometimes.  A lot of time you make it and stuff.  I think it's even cheaper sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes it is.  Especially if you're with a teenager.  
L:  Yeah.  Um, yeah.
R:  Uh, I remember when mine were teens.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I only have one last teen at home.  And she -- we live, um, I think it's so easy for me to go out because a block down my -- at the end of my street I have two restaurants and about, I want to say eight, but seven fast food places so I'm like awfully close to fast food.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it's like -- very convenient for me to hop in the car and five seconds later have dinner.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That would be convenient.  Uh, we're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't drive so it's a little h- harder on us but we're in Seattle so we -- we can have food delivered if we want.  
L:  Oh.  Yeah --
R:  If we can afford it.
L:  -- we're in Indianapo- [LAUGH].  Yeah, we're --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- in Indianapolis and I just tripped it about [MN] maybe six, seven months ago there's a Chinese place down by the racetrack from us that [MN] said that they delivered and like, [MN] we're like New York.  We get Chinese food.
R:  How cool.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I was thrilled to death because now I -- 'cause I love Chinese food so now I can get it delivered to my door really fast.  I'm like, "Boy, that works".  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what I like is we have this, uh, service in Seattle, uh, called four four three to go.  Which started out just on the phone with a -- a -- a book of menus of various restaurants and now they're online too so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we can go online and plug in what we want and, you know, the --
L:  Yeah, we -- we have --
R:  Takes 'em --
L:  -- a -- a couple that deliver but there's not -- no -- no big deal unless it's pizza.  I mean, that's like our Friday or a Saturday night thing.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Is having [MN] the pizza delivered.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get bored with just pizza though after a while.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I don't know.  It doesn't seem like my [LAUGH] family does.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Every week, uh, we want pizza.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, but you have a teenager at home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I have a -- I have other people at home too.  Now I think we got in a really bad habit of it when I was working, um, at the bank I was working in.  Everybody on Friday night wanted to go home and nobody wanted to cook after a --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- late Friday night.  So we all started ordering pizza every Friday.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was like -- it was like a big thing.  That's all we did.  Is everybody went home and ordered pizza.  And I think we just sorta fell into the, we're going to have pizza on the weekend thing.  You know.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  But everybody in the family likes pizza so we get pizza.  
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Sometimes I try to get something else but we pretty much get pizza.  
R:  Oh.  Our -- our big -- biggest thing we -- we tend to go for is things like, well, chicken wings or something like that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we --
R:  When we want cheap and we were bored with pizza.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  No, we will -- well, we got like, um, Taco Bells and McDonalds and Burger Kings and every other hamburger place known to man around by us so we have a lot of hamburgers and stuff too.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is -- sometimes we eat it, you know, we'll we eat -- we eat in a lot.  I do -- we do like to eat stuff 'cause like we can cook some really good meals but, you know, sometimes it's just easier, especially when I -- I work at night and my husband works too, then it's a lot easier just to get something or I look at him and go like [LAUGH] I ain't cooking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  I know how that goes.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  It's just some days you don't want to look at that stove or clean up after it or have anything, you know, where you can just sit and -- and eat something, you know.  'Cause when you -- in some of these places you can get it so fast now.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, there's a new place out by us.  It's -- it has -- well, it's like a drive in where you can go out and eat.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they serve the food so fast the other day to my daughter and me it wasn't funny.  I mean, it's like you -- you ask for it and it -- the lady walked out with it two seconds later.  
R:  That's quick.
L:  It's like, whoa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it was really fast.  I almost fell over but it was hot.
R:  Mhm
L:  And, you know, and it tasted good so it was, uh, fast was okay.  I mean, it was a hot dog so, I mean, you can't -- you can't destroy the hot dog too much but ...
R:  No.
L:  Um ...
R:  No, you can't.  
L:  But we like to go out.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I do too.  I like to go out and [MN] of course the big appeal with going out is visiting with friends while I'm out eating, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, we go out for parties.  Um, our tradition was like, um, when one of the kids had a birthday we would go out and take them out to eat.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That was like a big thing.  Whether it was, uh, whether I had a whole bunch of extra relatives with or whether it was just my husband and me and one of the kids or something.  You know, we -- that -- that was -- that's like our traditional thing to go out to eat so we go out for that.  If anything -- if we didn't do anything else we'd go out for that.  Or anything else that came up.  [LAUGH]  If it happened --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to give us an excuse to go out.  You know, that we had -- just had to go out for.  
R:  Right.  Right.  We have, uh, groups of people that are like computer people that we have like a monthly get together.  G.T. we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'em.  And we go out to eat then [MN] and sit around and talk and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eat and talk.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I wanted to start doing that with, um, there's a, um, woman organization out here for, um, women that own their own businesses and stuff and they stopped having regular meetings and now they start doing it once a month where they eat [MN] uh, eat, yeah.  Um, meet in a restaurant and actually eat.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and there and talk because it's, I guess, maybe 'cause it's a little bit friendlier instead of just looking at each other and gabbing about a bunch of stuff, you're actually getting a dinner too so it makes people show up and enjoy themselves a little bit more.  And I've been wanting to get back into it and just having it so should use an excuse to go out to eat, I [LAUGH] guess.  
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's a good excuse to go out and eat.
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, but then I have to cook dinner for somebody else before I [LAUGH] go so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't think you win that [LAUGH] way.  
R:  [LAUGH]  No, not once you like teach them to cook themselves and say --
L:  Well, they know how.
R:  -- y- your turn.  
L:  They --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They know how.  My kids don't like the way my husband cooks and my daughter doesn't want to really cook but she will so ...  No, they'd rather mom cook anyway so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I'm more bake than cook.  I'm into the baking more.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I -- but, yeah, eating out is -- is cool but it -- my -- I -- I think my thing is I get bored with cooking a lot because, uh, well, it started when my kids were teenagers and I used to really like cooking up to that point, and then I got teenagers who -- who would look at me and look at what I'd made and say, "You know, it looks really good but I -- I'm not really hungry".  In that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sort of tone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I get that -- yeah, I get that all the time too.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that kind of took the luster off my fun with --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- cooking.  
L:  Well, if they don't want it or with my -- my last one right now is she's so picky that it gets to the point that, um, I'm cooking almost two different meals.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I think that's maybe why we got -- where we started eating out more and stuff 'cause it was a lot easier just to get her what she wanted and get us what we wanted and then everybody was happy.  
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  And the price.  I know, I don't know about you but I know the steaks and the fish out by us is, uh, expensive and you can go get a steak dinner -- I mean, you can get prime rib out by us on different days of the week for like ten dollars for the whole meal.  So ...
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, by the time you buy a prime -- well, not only prime rib, by the time you buy, um, say, just, uh, some T bones or something in the store you're paying almost for -- two T bones is two people's meals by the time you buy all the stuff with it and stuff, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  It's a lot easier just to go out and have it.  Let somebody serve you.  
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is.  And just as cheap just about.  So, yeah, I -- I agree.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So that's where I got into where I preferred eating out to eating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in.  But --
L:  Well, I think I -- I -- I took it from my mom and dad too because they're older and they go out to eat all the time 'cause they get the, um, retiree meals and some of these places serve some pretty good sized meals, and they don't eat that much being older.  So they end up bringing up almost a meal for one, if not two meals home, for -- for the price of a discounted meal they get two different nights worth of meals and that
