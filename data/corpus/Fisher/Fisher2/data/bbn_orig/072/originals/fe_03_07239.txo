L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  My name's Marissa.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Steve.
R:  How are you?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm doing okay.
R:  That's good.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, understand we're supposed to talk about friends tonight.
R:  Appar- apparently. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So, um, I don't know, do you have a lot of friends, or ...?
L:  [NOISE] A few.
R:  Okay.  That's --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I- I'd just say that there are a few people that, ah, I get really close to and the others are kind of, you know, acquaintances.
R:  Yes.  That's exactly how I am.  I have a few really good friends and then I have mainly like my work friends that --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I don't really hang out with, things like that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Well, I was -- I was in the army, I'm a veteran and I, ah, um, I have people that I refer to as buddies, and they're a little bit closer to me than acquaintances, but they're not as close to me as friends.
R:  Ah.  See, and I'm -- I'm still, you know, pretty young and stuff, but I -- I think I have two contacts from high school and --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- that's about it.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  So it's -- [NOISE] I don't have much of a life. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I wouldn't say that yet, [LAUGH] don't put yourself down there.
R:  But I -- I have really good friends at work, you know, that --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- we can talk about everything and --
L:  [NOISE] Good, good.
R:  -- things like that, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Well, yeah.
R:  This is hard.  Ten minutes.  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Okay.  Well, I can always talk about man's best friend, the dog.  But I don't think they wanted us to talk about that.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's kind of a different friend, but that is a good friend. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  But, um, yeah, I just -- I don't know, I -- I don't seem to have a hard time making friends I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I just am [NOISE] picky about who's close to me or not.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I -- I -- I -- I really find it hard to trust people.  I'm kind of paranoid that way.  I --
R:  Yeah, I'm sort of in the same boat. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I've -- I've been hurt by a lot of friends so ...
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.
R:  [MN] So, yeah, I -- I don't have a, you know, ton but --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- the one's I do are really good, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I just don't want to, you know, get that close to people and don't want to get hurt again.
R:  Absolutely.  No, I agree.  And it's -- it's hard to know what people's [NOISE] intentions are, so ...
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But ...
L:  Well, wh- what do you look for in a friend?
R:  Oh, you know, [MN] that's a good question. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I don't know.  Mainly [NOISE] I --
L:  Companionship?
R:  -- I don't look for friends that are wanting something, you know? [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No, Emma.  Sorry, my two year old's --
L:  Yeah, I understand that.
R:  -- throwing a fit.  But, um, just 'cause I don't think you have good intentions when you're looking for something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- out of someone.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] What about you?
L:  Well, yeah.  Well, I mean, you've got to be completely honest sometimes and, you know, say that yo- you are looking for a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a friend that would benefit you in some way.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we don't go out in the street and make friends with the homeless.
R:  [NOISE] That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] Not usually.
R:  Maybe we should though, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  We could, we could, but for some reason we don't. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  But, you know, I mean, I just -- I don't know, I've -- I've had friends that have used me for money, things like that.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- obviously friends that -- I mean, you're looking for something, but I -- I guess more like physical things --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- if you know what I mean.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you know, looking to, I don't know, just use you in some manner.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
R:  So, you know, I'm pretty picky [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when it comes to people.
L:  Right.
R:  Kind of a snob. [LAUGH]
L:  You're a snob?
R:  Kind of. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  I don't know, I never thought of myself as being a snob, I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- kind of --
R:  Oh that's just personally me. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, that's just, you know -- that's just how I am.  I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very picky about anyone who comes in my life.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, ah, I don't know.  I -- I've always hoped I'd marry my best friend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whoever that would be.  I don't have one yet, but ... [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if that counts for anything. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE]
R:  [PAUSE] But, ah, yeah.  So yo- you said you served in the army?
L:  In the army, yeah [inaudible].
R:  That's very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, um, I'm sure you'd have to trust -- trust quite a few people though.
L:  Yes, you do.  You do.
R:  [NOISE] So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, it's like -- an- and again that's kind of a trade off kind of a thing.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I watch your back and then I expect you, if the situation is reversed, you watch my back.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So I'm -- I'm sure that would be hard.  I think I'd have a difficult time --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- doing that.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But just 'cause I don't always trust people to watch my back. [LAUGH]  But, ah, I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So [LAUGH] this is -- you know, I thought this would be a really easy subject and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- it's tough.
L:  Well, something we think we know something about and then when we get to, you know, the nitty gritty, ah, "Ah, well, my gosh, um, um, um, um".
R:  Yeah, absolutely. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, that's exactly -- I -- yeah, ah, I don't know.  I mean, I just -- I guess we don't know what to say with it, you know, I don't know you and, [NOISE] um, so I --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I -- i- i- in some ways it is better that way because, ah [NOISE] [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- otherwise, ah, [LAUGH] it would be kind of predictable.
R:  That's true.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it -- it's still just, ah, hmm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like I said, just a subject I thought I'd have more input on.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Are you generally like the leader of your friends, or are you more kind of --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- in the background?
L:  Um, [NOISE] like, if I'm in a project or something, I'm -- I'm usually not comfortable unless I am a leader. [NOISE]
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  That's interesting.
L:  In other words, I -- I don't -- I don't take direction easily. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Which, you know, doesn't make a very good soldier. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's very true.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  But what about like at a gathering or something, if you --
L:  [NOISE] Well, at a gathering I'm a kind of a wallflower.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's kind of how I am too.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  If I go to a party or something with a friend, I'll --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, if I -- if I don't know anybody I wait for another person to introduce himself or herself to me. [NOISE]
R:  Yes, absolutely.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I'm -- I am rather the same way unfortunately.  I wish I was a lot more outgoing, but I'm not as much.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But it goes back to that whole being hurt thing. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the -- the -- the wounds that come early in life are sometimes never gotten over with.  They say time heals all things.  I don't think so.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  [NOISE] I've not found it to be so.
R:  I agree.  I mean, and I'm -- again, I'm still pretty still, but, yeah, I totally agree.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Ah, it's -- it's not easy to heal from things and to trust people again and --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  [NOISE] Which -- it's not like I feel guilty necessarily or -- or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Ah, but, um, I have -- I have really, really deep feelings and usually -- like, for example, my father.  I -- I feel like he shouldn't have died when he died.  He died too young.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] And I usually don't think about it.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] But if it comes up, I -- I feel -- I feel very deeply.
R:  Right, well, absolutely.  I think that would be hard to deal with.  I couldn't imagine, I haven't lost a parent yet luckily and, ah --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  -- you know, I just -- I think it would be very hard and, yeah, you do -- you, ah -- [MN] it- it's just hard -- [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- any more and it's -- plus, yeah, I'm sort of in that same boat.  I used to work with, um, older people in a rehabilitation --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- center and --
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  -- I have a hard time getting close to people because I care so deeply.
L:  [NOISE] Sure, sure.  You know that --
R:  Yes, and so --
L:  [NOISE] You know that the inevitable's going to happen.
R:  Absolutely.  And they're there for a reason and a lot of them aren't there for very long and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- um, it's -- it is, it's very hard.  So ...
L:  [NOISE] Well, I tell ya, I had a person that, um, I was at work with one night and he got sick.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And he went home.  He never came back.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [NOISE] He died that night.
R:  See, yeah, stuff like that, it's just kind of crazy.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  I mean, you just --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we were all shocked.
R:  -- you never know. [NOISE]
L:  I mean, we went to the -- to the park, you know.  And we didn't know any of his relatives or anything like that, but we all made a strong showing, I don't know, there were ten or twelve of us there --
R:  Right.
L: [NOISE] -- representing, you know, his, ah, his work buddies.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But, I mean, that's -- you know, and it's always good.  And I -- I just -- I truly believe that they see that and that they see, you know, [NOISE] all of their friends did show up and the people that actually [NOISE] cared were there and --
L:  Yeah, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah, it's -- I -- but yeah, it is, [NOISE] it's hard.  See that's another thing [NOISE] is, you know, it's hard to get close to people --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause you just never know and --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, you've had enough heartache, you don't need one more I guess.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  But I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and then the next time you -- you go to work and someone's missing, you think, well, you know, is this person out sick or is this person, you know --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [NOISE] -- never coming back?
R:  Yep.  You just -- you never know.  So, it's kind of crazy.  Not easy.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, [LIPSMACK] yeah.
R:  But such is life -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  [NOISE] What's that Shakespeare said?  "Parting is such sweet sorrow".
R:  Oh, it's so true.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, mhm.
R:  It's very true.  Who would've known?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But, yeah, I [SIGH] -- I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's funny how all these things --
R:  It doesn't seem fair sometimes.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  All these things from high school come back, you know.  Julius Caesar and --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]-- Romeo and Juliet and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]-- you know, the Tempest and -- and all of those things [LAUGH] that Shakespeare wrote.
R:  Yes, oh --
L:  Everybody --
