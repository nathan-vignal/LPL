R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my --
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Gwen.
L:  My name -- go ahead.  
R:  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]  My name is Gwen.  I'm from Virginia.  Who are you?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, my name is Lydia.  I'm from Pennsylvania, but recently moved from Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Right.  
L:  So we get to talk about food.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  
L:  This -- this is an easy one.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess.  I don't know. 
R:  All right.  Um, I guess I like to -- I don't mind eating out in a restaurant but I like to pr- I prefer to eat at home.  [LAUGH]  I guess.
L:  Yeah.  I'm gonna have to say the same thing.  I like the restaurant maybe as a special treat every now and then but, honestly, as a preference I'd rather just eat at home.  
R:  Uh-huh.  It's [inaudible] -- you know, for special occasions I don't mind to go out and eat.  Like over the weekend we just had my son's wedding so I got to go out and eat a couple of times for the rehearsal.
L:  There you go.  Yeah.
R:  And then afterwards I got to go out and eat too.  So that was nice.
L:  Yeah.  It gets expensive.
R:  It does.  It really does.
L:  It's -- it's a lot, like, for people who go out and eat everyday at their lunch break at, like, Olive Garden or something.
R:  I know.
L:  So I --
R:  I --
L:  -- c- can't [LAUGH] imagine spending that much money.  I think I'm just cheap.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I don't know how they do it.
L:  But, uh --
R:  I really don't.  Um, I mean, especially if you have a family.  Um, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- don't know about you but there was like five of us in our family, you know, so I mean we couldn't do that everyday.  That's for sure so ...
L:  Yeah.  I mean, we had four kids and my parents, and eating out was like for my mom's birthday.  That was like all it was reserved [LAUGH] for.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And maybe every now and then but just not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something we did.  And also I guess because probably the reason for that is that my -- my family, like my mother and my grandmother, like they cooks.  And they are good cooks.  
R:  Right.
L:  So it just seemed natural that, like, food got prepared at home and it was just what I was used to, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...  
R:  Now I don't mind going out and getting something that I don't usually cook at home, like seafood, 'cause I don't usually cook seafood --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at home so I don't mind going out and doing something like that but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I can understand that.  
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause, you know, you can cook different things at home but then those things that you don't usually cook at home, if I go out and eat them, like get something I don't usually cook, you know.
L:  Right.  I might eat like a certain, like, ethnic food like I don't have experience preparing and it's just easier to get it out than try and like stare at a cookbook and make something but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, yeah, that's how I feel about that.  
R:  That makes sense.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  What was the other one?  I -- what was your -- your favorite meal?  Your perfect meal or something like that?
R:  Oh, right.  Yeah, the perfect meal.  Geez.  I guess, um --
L:  I don't know if I have [several inaudible words] that I'm like --I'm so not picky about [LAUGH] eating.
R:  I'm not either, really.  Tell you the truth.  I guess --
L:  I'm not picky but I guess, you know, like what I might like to have is maybe sit down and eat a donut but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I know in theory what I should be having is nice leafy green vegetables.  [LAUGH]  [inaudible] but ...
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  I really haven't had -- decided a perfect meal.  I mean, maybe to have somebody come and wait on us as a family in the house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That would be a perfect meal, you [LAUGH] now.  Somebody to cook it here in the house.  How would that be?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess the perfect meal would be something that's tasty, that's nutritious and like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I can cook in less than thirty minutes.
R:  There you go.  [LAUGH]  That would be good.  Mhm.
L:  Because a lot of times I -- I can make something that I enjoy but just a little more prep time than I like.  I don't know.  I tend to like Italian food.
R:  Mhm.  That's good.
L:  But, uh, I don't know.  [LAUGH]  Just food.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's good.  It really is.  And I love salads.  I like to have, you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wish that salads, the -- the vegetables would stay fresher for salad --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- mixes.  But they just -- they don't.  You know.  They're gone and they just wilt and they just don't stay as fresh as what I like 'em too.  
L:  Yeah.  I've tried all sorts of crazy tricks.  [LAUGH]  But, uh, it's hard to keep fruit and vegetables fresh.
R:  Yes, it is.  [LAUGH]  And then --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- watermelon.  I love watermelon and things like that.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, I mean, they don't like to stay fresh either.  [LAUGH]  
L:  No.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Do you cook often?  [MN]
R:  Um, I used to when the kids were growing up but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- now that they're older they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sorta -- they're into fast foods and, of course, you can't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tell 'em that fast foods isn't very good for you but ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They have their money they like to spend so ...  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like one of these days they'll realize it's not -- so I mainly have one teenager here at the house, well, he's seventeen so it's -- I have to cook for him and my husband and myself so ... And it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- basically I can get maybe like the lean cuisine or some of those, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [inaudible] made things I can pop in the oven every once in a while or, you know, or cook something up and then like chicken or chicken breasts or something like and cook those.
L:  Yeah.  I'm single so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my way of cooking is pretty much like to cook a lot on the weekends and then have an appropriate amount of leftovers during the week.  
R:  That's good.
L:  Because it's -- it's hard to motivate yourself to cook for one person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sometimes.  Because I'm like, it's just me.  Like it doesn't matter if I e- eat healthy or not.  But I will if I like plan it out in advance.  
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  And it's still better than going to a restaurant like, uh ...
R:  Oh, that's true too.  That's true.  I remember when I was single I was hitting the salad bars quite a bit.  You know, it's like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I missed out on a lot of red meat and steak and things like that.  I ended up getting anemic [LAUGH] so the doctor said you can't do that.  You have to eat better than that.  And I'm like, okay.  [LAUGH]  So I had to learn, uh, to eat a different way so ...  So, yeah, that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wise what you're doing.  How did you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get hooked up with this study?
L:  Um, somebody I knew sent me an email about it.  Um, uh, somebody I knew from high school.  She's a student at Jefferson.  I don't know exactly how she found out about this, but I'm sure, you know, it just got passed around to people who knew this --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and sent it to other ones.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Oh, it was [inaudible] wh- when you were talking about saving money and things like that I was on a refunding site that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we -- we save money.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Like, you know, um, trying to, you know, use coupons and get rebates and this and that and the other.  And that's --
L:  Nice.
R:  -- how I found out about it.  So I was just wondering if you happened to be one of the refunders, as we call ourselves. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, somebody told me about it.  They're just like, "Hey, I know that you're not gonna be working during the summer.  So , like ..."
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "Here you can earn some money".  I was like, okay.  Uh, like, whatever.  I was just like oh, I can talk on the phone for [LAUGH] ten minutes I guess.  
R:  That's true.  This is the third one.  How many have you done?
L:  This is actually my third one but something happened with the first one I got.  I got cut off.  I don't know.  Or the other person hung up on me.  I wasn't sure exactly what happened.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  I didn't understand.  But, um, I had another one.  The person was getting like really into it. [LAUGH] and just kept going the whole time and I was like, okay, we're fine.  They were like, you know, your time's up and she's just, "Oh, I was really getting into this".  I was, like, I know.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
L:  So, yeah.
R:  And I had one that didn't know anything about what we were doing and doesn't know how he got his name into it or -- or nothing.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Like well, --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- obviously somehow --
L:  Interesting.
R:  -- or other you're in -- put into the study or somehow [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, like someone put all your stuff in then to use.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I don't know.  Anyway ...
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  I have nothing else to say about restaurants and food.  And my perfect meal.  Really it's -- it's just -- there's just not that much I can say about it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  I don't either.
L:  So I think --
R:  I do like to go out --
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, I do like to go out to eat and everything but, uh, every once in a while, like special occasions.  And I do like --
L:  I think --
R:  -- Italian food.
L:  -- men like to go out to eat more than women for some reason.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I know my husband doesn't really like to.  He prefers to --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  He likes to every once in a while but he prefers that we can go and get it and bring it back home and eat.  That's nice too.
L:  That's good.
R:  So [inaudible].  We do that too.  And we do have a number of choices around here so that's nice too.  [LAUGH]  
L:  That's good.  Yeah.  I -- actually I moved up from Texas.  I live in the very south east corner close to the Gulf and about five miles north of the Mexican border.
R:  Oh.  
L:  So going out to eat was getting Mexican food.  [LAUGH]  Like -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- either in Mexico or in the United States, so it was fun but there -- for the past three years if -- if I was eating out I was probably eating Mexican food so there wasn't -- I mean, there's like two Italian restaurants and then, like, you know, just an American cuisine place and a whole bunch of chain restaurants.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But now that I've moved back to Philadelphia where my -- just remembering.  Oh, yeah, [LAUGH] like there are other --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- other things to eat besides Mexican food.
R:  Yeah, I think [inaudible] --
L:  It was great.  I mean, it was -- it was -- you would never get better Mexican food anywhere except ...
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, Mexico, but, uh ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  I was gonna say --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- that, that you did.
L:  -- it was close enough that we could be like, "Let's go out to eat".  "Okay.  Like which country?  Like this one or Mexico" and just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- walk across the bridge but ...
R:  Right.  
L:  And that also I guess like skewed my view on eating out because I was like, well, they all have the same food so ...
R:  Right.  Mhm.  Now how 'bout Philadelphia.  Do they have good cheese steaks up there?  Cheese steaks --
L:  Yes, they do.  I was actually vegetarian for a while.  I kind of am but not too much anymore.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the cheese steaks there are good.  Like if -- if you want to eat one this is the place to get them.
R:  That's what I've heard.
L:  And they actually -- Philadelphia has very good restaurants but there's no restaurant districts, like in other cities.  Or like go to this section.  Like they're just kind of places that are tucked away.  You really kind of have to be familiar.  I don't know if you've ever been to Philadelphia but it's not a very -- it's a great city but I don't know if it's very tourist friendly.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] okay.
L:  Like, it's hard to like -- it's not that [inaudible] mean the tourists.  It's hard to find out the good places to eat.  Like historic places, like the Liberty Bell or Constitution Hall it -- you can get too fairly easily with lots of assistance, but if you're looking for somewhere to eat, like there's no cluster of restaurants.  Like you'd have to kinda like seek them out.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...  I don't know.
R:  Okay.  Hm.  I'll have to remember that.
L:  But as a person who doesn't go out to eat that much it doesn't really bother me 'cause I just cook at home anyway.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you know when people visit they kinda want to, like, be taken out.  Not like served my food necessarily.  So ... 
R:  [MN]
L:  Have to figure out at some point.  
R:  [LAUGH]
