L:  Hi, my name is Clarice.
R:  Hello.  I'm Louisa.  
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]  Um, so what are we talking about?  Um --
R:  Are we --
L:  -- food.
R:  Food.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  One of my favorite subjects.  
L:  Okay, um, you want to go first?
R:  Well, I -- I will probably -- I'm trying not to interrupt but, um, I love going to eat out.  That's one of my favorite things to do.  It's like more than just eating out to me.  It's entertainment 'cause you get to go to different restaurants and, I don't know, I like to have the feel of people around me so ...
L:  Yeah, same goes for me too.  I love eating out.  Um, it's fun.  I love trying different food.  Um, I don't know.
R:  And it doesn't hurt that I don't cook at all either.  At all.  
L:  I love -- [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean I -- 
L:  You don't?
R:  I mean I try but everything that I cook sucks.  It's -- it, um, like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, seriously this is [MN], uh, we cook a -- a meal, um, I'm from Mexico and we cook --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a meal that's like a country fried steak. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the first time that I cooked it, you know, you're supposed to, you know, batter it with, um, you know the batter on both sides.  
L:  Yeah.  Like flour --
R:  Well, I didn't know that --
L:  -- and stuff?
R:  Yes.  Exactly.  I didn't know it was flour.  I thought it was salt.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, my God.  
R:  I'm serious.  I know.  I know.  So I served it to my dad.  I served it to my brother.  And I said -- you know, it looked good 'cause I used like the lemon pepper salt all over it.
L:  Yeah.  Oh ... [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, it was -- I mean, it was, you know, battered in salt.  And --
L:  Are you serious?
R:  No, I'm serious.  And then they said -- they said, you know what?  They took a bite, 'cause it looked good, and he says, no, you eat it.  If you eat it [LAUGH] I'll eat it.  
L:  [MN]
R:  This is what my dad said.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you serious?
R:  I feel bad but I will never attempt -- I mean, I still get jokes about it to this day so ...  You know, whatever.
L:  Oh, my God.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, so I'm -- I don't know really what to say.  Uh, well I can cook a lot.  I can cook real good but I just love to eat out.  I love seafood. 
R:  Can you?  What's your -- what's the easiest thing that you can cook?  Like what's --
L:  The easiest?
R:  -- one thing -- yeah, one thing that you could whip if you know that you're having guests over, you can whip it up and everybody's going to be like, "Dang, that was good"?
L:  Um, I gu- -- say it's soya sauce chicken.  
R:  Mm.  I wish I had --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- some kind of -- I wish -- it's 'cause I just ate lunch so I'm still kinda like, mm, this is -- this is good but ...
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's another --
L:  I usually -- yeah, it's easy.
R:  [MN]  
L:  I don't know like ever --
R:  How easy is it?
L:  It's real easy.  It's just basically ...  It's just chicken.  Season it up.  Salt and pepper and garlic.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- tons of [inaudible], chives, whatever.  And then you just put soya sauce on it and then you bake it in the oven for like about thirty minutes and then ...
R:  And at, uh, what temperature?
L:  [MN]  Probably three fifty.  
R:  Three fifty.  Does it like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the chicken have to be, um, what's it called, peeled?  The skin peeled --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- or -- or not?
L:  Um, you can put drumsticks in there.  You can put thighs in there.  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- basically just season it up, add soya sauce and a little bit of water and then just put it in the oven.  It's easy.  Real easy.
R:  Is that it?  Does that sound a lot easier than I -- I think it.  You know.
L:  Yeah it just -- it seems like it'll be complicated when -- when you get it.  When you just put your mind to it, it's real easy. 
R:  See and that's -- well, the only thing that I can cook and please, how hard is it?  Is spaghetti.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh [LAUGH] really.  
R:  I can --
L:  Really?  I'm not -- that's -- well, sometimes it takes some effort for some good spaghetti sometimes 'cause I tasted --
R:  Okay.  No, no, no, not fresh --
L:  -- some [inaudible].
R:  -- spaghetti.  Not fresh spaghetti.  Don't go there.  I'm not going to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- cut tomatoes or anything else, [LAUGH] okay?  
L:  [LAUGH]  Are you serious?
R:  But the -- it's horrible.  Uh, you know who makes a darn good spaghetti?  My dad.  He will do the whole -- I will whip up br- fresh tomatoes.  I will cut up the garlic.  I will do it all.  He -- he will --
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Yeah.  He does some phenomenal spaghetti like y- you know that TV show, Emeralds?  Bam[?]!
L:  Are you [LAUGH] serious?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He -- he does.
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't have nobody.  That's the only reason why I learned how to cook.  Is for my mother not being at home so ...
R:  Mm.  Well ...
L:  I was like here by myself all the time.  She was out [several inaudible words].
R:  Well, my mom knows how to cook.  I'm not gonna try and blame the, I don't know how to cook, on my mom.  'Cause my mom knows how to cook.  [MN]  I mean --
L:  Really?
R:  -- everytime I go home she's like, I mean, she'll whip up like a whole meal for like four people from like, "Mom, I'm on my way home.  I'm bringing some friends".  She'll be like, bam, like she planned it for a week.  
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I mean I --
L:  Are you serious?
R:  I can't do that.  I can't --
L:  My mother, [MN].  She used to cook when I was little probably 'cause she had to but now, uh-uh.  She's [MN] -- she stays in her room and I'll just cook up something.  I bring it in her room.
R:  Oh.
L:  And just -- yeah.  
R:  That's worth it though.
L:  So ...
R:  I mean, I bet you it's -- it's nice that she's like, "Oh, you know, I taught you how to cook this.  Please".  You know.
L:  I know.  How she is -- that's how she is around her friends.  I let her have her little fame.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Her little fame time but ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I miss my mom since she doesn't live, um, in the same city that I do.  Like when I go home it's like, oh, home cooked meals, yum.
L:  Are you serious?
R:  But -- yeah, because I -- I -- even as -- as much as I try, if I get all the help I can, if I follow the directions to the T, like, if something that like my mom makes with her food, it's just, I don't know if it's just --
L:  Really?
R:  -- me or if it's in my head, or whatever, but it's just so good.  She makes it with lots --
L:  Really?
R:  -- of love.  You know what I mean? 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ... 
L:  That's cute.  That's how I feel about my grandmother's cooking.  Everything is good.  What kind of food do you like?
R:  Oh, I like it all.  I -- I mean, it's ea- -- the one thing that I -- I'm not is a vegetarian.  I will --
L:  Really?
R:  -- eat all kinds of meat. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, like [MN] whenever I have like a -- I had this one vegetarian friend at college and I'm like, well, shoot I don't know what to, you know, if you're ever coming to my house you're going to be like, "Ew".  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, 'cause we, I mean, whatever the opposite of ve- vegetarian is, like I am a carnivore.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Are you serious?
R:  You know what I'm saying?  Like, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I like barbecuing.  I like, you know, chicken.  I like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all that good stuff.  To me that's like, you know, that's what [MN] -- your meal has to consist of some kind of meat.  It can't just be --
L:  I know it does.
R:  -- vegetables.  That's crazy.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  How do you eat just vegetables?  And so ...
L:  Vegetables and sometimes they don't even eat eggs.  Some vegetarians.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Because of the by products.  I -- I've heard of those.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Those people are called +Vegans and they don't even eat like beans, 'cause they have the oil of some --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm just like, geez, you know.  If you're calculating all that, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's all kinds of things that you couldn't be doing.  You couldn't be wearing clothes because they're on cotton fields that feed the animals that, you know ...
L:  I know.  I know.  
R:  Oh, no way[?].
L:  And I have to have my furs too.  My fur coats and stuff.  That's just--
R:  Y- you know, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to each his own.  But I mean I respect that but like some of them get real, like, if you eat something else, like they get all ...
L:  Then they'll look at you.
R:  Yeah.  And I don't think that's --
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  -- right either.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]  I know.  That's, I don't think that's cool at all.
R:  That's not right either so ...
L:  [MN] 
R:  You know, whatever.  So have you done this before yet?
L:  Um, no, this is my first time.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Me too. 
L:  It is?
R:  It's so weird. 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  What part of --
L:  It is.
R:  -- the nation are you from?
L:  I'm in California.
R:  Oh, I'm in Texas.  So it is --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah.  So this is like the long distance conversation I'm talking --
L:  I know [inaudible].
R:  -- like it --
L:  [LAUGH]  Like you're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right next door or something.
R:  Right.  Well, now if I was --
L:  I know.
R:  -- right next door I'd probably go over to your house to eat some chicken  [LAUGH] 
L:  I [LAUGH] know.  Really?  How long --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, have you been staying in Texas?  
R:  Uh, well, since I was born raised here.  I used to live in El Paso which is a border town right next to where Mexico is.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and then I moved, um, to finish school in Austin.  And now I am in Dallas.
L:  Oh --
R:  So ...  
L:  -- really?  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So who do you live with out there?
R:  Um, I just got married.  Um, in March.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Congratulations.
R:  -- went into the [inaudible].  It wasn't 'cause of my cooking skills.  I guarantee.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, he knows how to cook too, which I guess I got lucky.  He likes to cook.  Or ...
L:  Are you --
R:  You know.
L:  -- serious?
R:  I mean --
L:  That'd be beautiful.
R:  When we were first together it was, like, oh, wow.  He used to cook me like crab legs and lobster and steak.
L:  [MN]
R:  Girl, please.  It was a front.  It was such --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- a front.  I don't eat no lobster --
L:  Are you --
R:  -- or steak now.
L:  Are you ...?  [LAUGH]  Are you serious?  I got to have that.  
R:  Well, I hope -- I -- I mean, [MN] I wish.  I wish.  But it was just a ploy.  He was trying to suck me right in.  And it worked.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Are you seri- -- how you long been together?
R:  Um, four years.  So ...
L:  Four years.  Oh, that's the same as me and my boyfriend.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  We been talking --
R:  How did you guys meet?
L:  -- about getting married but ...  Huh?
R:  How did you guys meet?
L:  High school sweethearts.
R:  What?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's awesome.  Oh, man.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I didn't even --
L:  I know.
R:  I didn't even have no sweethearts in high school that I would still be like, oh, wow.  You know what I mean?  Because I think that in high school that [MN] just everybody wants to live their own life, so if people stay sweethearts that's like devotion.  That's like -- that's just my one.
L:  I know.  It is.  
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  'Cause it's like -- it's like, oh, I told him, "You started changing a lot".  Like throughout those couple of four years he started changing and feeling different.  I guess you've just gotta hang on in there or something.  
R:  That's tough.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's tough.  But that's not something that, say, you know, vouch for.  You know what I mean?  If people -- you could say, "Hey, that's my high school sweetheart".  I have a very close friend of mine named Monica.  Um, who her -- her guy, I -- I don't know if they're married just yet, I haven't talked to her in about a year, but they've been together nine years.  
L:  Are you serious?
R:  High school sweethearts and everything.  And they're still all goo goo weird over each other.  
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Yeah.  It's a beautiful, uh, I just look at her.  I'm like, dang, girl.  That's beautiful.  You know what I mean?
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  She lives out there with -- in -- in Texas?
R:  She actually moved to Houston.  We -- we lost touch of each other so I'm still trying to find out, um, if my wedding invitation went to her house 'cause it never got returned to me but I'm not sure I got her right address so ...
L:  Oh.  
R:  We'll see.  Oh, that's -- that's another thing, like, you see couples like that and, you know, you see 'em all lovey dovey and you're like, oh, they just met a week ago, whatever.  But then, you know, you see Monica and [inaudible] and they've been together nine years.  They're like sweet.  I could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- learn something, you know.
L:  Yeah, that is so --
R:  But ...  
L:  -- cute.  
R:  Um ...
L:  Um, I'm trying to think, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah, we were --
L:  I don't really even know what to do on these lines, you [LAUGH] know. 
R:  Me either.  
L:  'Cause like when I was reading it, like the outline of the whole thing.  It's like you have to talk about food.  I'm like, okay
