R:  Hi, my name is Lydia Kelps[?].  I live in Seattle, Washington.
L:  Hi, Lydia.  My name's Alfred.  I live in, uh, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh.  
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm pretty good.  [LAUGH]  This is my first time doing this.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, it's fun.  Don't [MN] -- don't worry about a thing.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Uh, so what do you think?  Uh, do you like to eat in restaurants or do you prefer eating at home.
R:  Oh, probably restaurants just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because there's more variety and I don't have to fix it.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I like a lot of ethnic foods.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, so I can try different things and I don't have to go to, like, the grocery store and buy all these weird things that if I don't like something then I'm stuck with that ingredient.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, if you don't like your food though you're stuck with your dish, right?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but then it's just the one time and you know either not to go back to the restaurants or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not to order that dish again, you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And there's days when, like, you know, I'll -- I have my favorite restaurants and I'll go there and --
L:  What's your favorite restaurant?
R:  Oh, [SIGH] gosh.  Uh, it's kind a like, you know, if I want a Chinese meal there's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a little restaurant near me.  I have all my favorite little ones of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- different ethnicities.  
L:  Right.
R:  So, [SIGH] you know, and then, you know, depending on how quick it is.  I +often -- also will go, like, to a store deli, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And just take stuff and then go home and eat that so ...  I'm not preparing that but ...  Yeah.
L:  Right.  
R:  So --
L:  So, um, so most people -- I mean, you mentioned, uh, mentioned one of the things you don't like about, uh, [MN] preparing your food at home is -- is the actual preparing.  I mean, most people love that, right?  It's the cleaning that most people hate.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Actually, that's pr- pretty true too.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, okay.
R:  Well it depends on how tired I am.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, if it's a quick little thing, that's one thing.  And -- or if I'm in an ambitious mood.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I been -- I been actually doing a lot more.  Trying out dif- different things and, um, I been -- because it's getting to be summertime I'm trying out new vegetables and cooking with new vegetables like --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- bok choy and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- eggplant and all that k- -- I mean, like, they may be normal, um, um, vegetables, but I'm trying to do them in different ways.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  I have some orange ruffie fish.  I'm -- I -- so I was surfing the net earlier today looking for, um, [LIPSMACK] some good recipes with that.
L:  I love orange ruffie.  That's such a -- it's such a delicious fish.  
R:  [MN]  Oh.  So is it -- what -- what's fish is it the most similar too?
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, uh, let's see.  It's -- it's kind of flavorful but it's more fleshy than a lot of, uh -- I mean, it's more flavorful than cod, right, but, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it's -- it's got a same sort of texture, you know.  Flakes really easily if you get it fresh.  Um, oh, the problem is that it's been over fished though.  So --
R:  Really?
L:  -- uh, yeah, yeah.  That's -- it's been in short supply for a while.  The supplies -- the -- the -- the stocks in the ocean are dwindling.  
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, there was something -- there was something recent actually, I think, in, um, in one of the -- in one of the major science magazines about that.  I don't know if you already heard about it.  But, um, yeah, yeah.  The f -- the fi- fish supplies are, um, are really being over -- over -- over fished.  It's -- it's -- people -- people are starting to get really worried.
R:  Hm.
L:  But [LAUGH] in any case --
R:  Well --
L:  -- orange ruffie is a delicious fish.  How do you prepare it?
R:  Well, I found one.  Its this peanut crusted fish fillets with fried bananas.  And it comes with --
L:  Oh, ambitious.  You're right.  
R:  Yeah.  It [MN] -- they suggest either ruffie or flounder.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So, we'll see.  It looks -- but it has, like, um, fresh lime juice and -- and salted peanuts here.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, the cumin looks like its' the major spice.  
L:  Oh, I live cumin.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So what about you?  Now are you a cooker at home or do you like going out?
L:  [LAUGH]  I like going out.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I -- I -- I -- I mean, I do like to cook but it's -- it's the cleaning up.  I just can't do it.  Yeah.  I mean, I -- right now I live in, uh, um, my apartment has a tiny kitchen.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, with a tiny sink.  And, uh, so that -- that -- that's certainly, um, you know, a discouraging factor and, uh -- oh, and -- and we had a -- a, um, [MN] a mouse infestation a while ago.
R:  Oh, [MN].  Ew.
L:  Yeah.  So -- so I -- I was scared of, uh, you know, running into the -- into the kitchen for a [LAUGH] little bit.  Um, and that -- that sort of, uh, that sort of, uh, continued to be the case.  
R:  So now in a typical week how many nights out do you probably eat out?
L:  Oh, good God.  Maybe every night.  
R:  Really?  So, do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you eat the whole meal or do you take leftovers and use them for, like, um, left- -- um, do you take leftovers and use them for leftovers on -- on another day or ...
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I definitely rely on leftovers heavily.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I, [MN], yeah, I try and -- I try and, uh, be parsimonious about that.  Yeah.
R:  Now is Philadelphia known for a lot of ethni- ethnic foods or do you guys find -- do you find it's more of a meat and potatoes kind of city, or what?
L:  Oh, no.  Philadelphia has -- actually has an amazing restaurant scene.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, you know --
R:  What are some of the predominant re- -- um, things, 'cause -- I mean, I think [LAUGH] Philadelphia stinks.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to stereotype.  So what are the some of the real popular, you know --
L:  Well, the classic is the -- the cheese steak, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, yeah, and then your Italian hoagie sandwiches.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so the -- the Italian section of town is -- plays -- plays a pretty big role in, uh, the restaurant scene.  And then there are the new re- -- you know, obviously we have our Chinatown.  Uh, all kids of ethnic restaurants, you know, from Moroccan to Japanese --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to, uh, Ethiopian and [MN] you know, Afghan food.  You know, there -- there's, uh -- there's -- there's -- there's a ton of things.  But, uh, I mean, I think there's been a huge upsurge lately in the fanciest restaurants, you know, unbelievably -- believable -- uh, believe it or not, um, you know, like the -- I don't know if you've ever seen the Iron Chef television show on TV?
R:  Oh, yeah, that's so fun.  I love [LAUGH] watching them.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, um, the -- one of the Iron Chefs opened a restaurant in town.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  It -- uh, it's Morimoto[?].  It's, um, Iron Chef USA or American, Japan -- Iron Chef Japan.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, anyway his -- so his restaurant's in town.  Um, [inaudible] [MN] that place is incredible.  [LAUGH]  They had a -- they had a tuna pizza that's basically --
R:  Tuna pi- --
L:  -- you know, um, you know, incredibly fresh, uh --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- thinly sliced tuna carpaccio with m- -- spicy mayonnaise and jalapenos, onions and it's just -- everything's raw sitting on a cracker.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  But it was delicious.  It's delicious.
R:  That sounds delicious.  My mouth was watering when you're talking about that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause you're probably, you know, like two or three hours ahead of me so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you've already had dinner a couple of hours ago.
L:  Yeah, I have.
R:  And I'm just about to go home to cook dinner so ...
L:  Oh, oh, oh.  So what do you think you're going to make tonight?
R:  Oh, I have some left over [SIGH] um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sort of, like, what I call spaghetti pie.  Which is more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- of close to, uh, um, a lasagna.  I got it out of the, um, what is it?  Better Homes and Garden cookbook, and it's -- it's a fun little thing and it's really flavorful and I put in some spicy hot Italian sausage so ...
L:  Oh, sounds delicious.
R:  Yeah.  I'll have some bread and finish off the salad.  You know, have some salad stuff.
L:  So, what's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
R:  Oh, gosh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, what [MN]?  [LAUGH] I'll have to think about this.  [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, what's -- what's the -- where -- where do you think is the best meal you've ever had?
R:  Oh, that's too numerous to count.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I, um, yeah, there's just some -- I know all about presentation too.  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so [MN] --
L:  So that -- that plays a big role in, uh, in how much you enjoy a meal.
R:  Yeah.  Or at least [MN] -- 'specially the start of it.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, oh gosh.  See now as soon as I hang up, you know, I'll remember all these things but ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Of course with people, you know, rather than dining alone.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That -- now do you dine alone?  I mean, if -- or do you just usually go out with friends?  'Cause you say you eat out almost every night.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  I usually eat out with my girlfriend.
R:  Oh, okay.  So you have a girlfriend?
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  And, uh --
R:  So who decides where you guys are gonna go?
L:  Oh, I -- you know --
R:  Do you take turns or mutual or ...?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think we take turns.  Um, if I -- if I -- if I'm not being particular -- particularly pushy, you know, I think she -- we -- we -- we -- we somehow come to a consensus [LAUGH] on something.  I don't know.  Um, yeah.  I -- I -- I -- I don't know.  I don't know how we -- yeah, I think -- I guess we do do it together.  God, I hope so.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um ...
R:  So what is the one -- what has been one of the best meals that you've ever had?
L:  Oh, God.  There's -- well there's this place, um, called Susannah Foods in Philadelphia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, God, it's a beautiful restaurant and it's this, uh, it's this mix of French and Chinese food.  
R:  [MN].  
L:  I mean --
R:  That's a fun mix.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, it's -- it's amazing.  It's -- it's -- it's one of the finest restaurants I've ever been in.  I mean, it's just so delicious.  The food is, you know, just succulent and [LAUGH] uh, [MN] you know, I don't [MN] -- look you know it's -- it's things like wild mushroom dumplings with foie gras, you now.  It's crazy --
R:  Wow.
L:  Uh, gold leaf chocolate cake.  You know, that sort of, like, ridiculous but at the same time, you know, it sounds very pretentious, I -- I realise as I -- as I'm like spouting this out but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- nevertheless it's so delic- --
R: Okay, you have -- you must have a good job and a healthy [LAUGH] budget?  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  [LAUGH]  No.  No, that's --
R:  I [several inaudible words] alone so I ... [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] 
L:  No.  You know, it's funny --
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  Oh, no, go ahead.
L:  No, no, i- it's -- actually I'm just a student [LAUGH] so it's -- it's totally ridiculous and I'm living completely beyond my means, just like most other Americans, I guess.  Um --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah, what do you do?
R:  Um, I'm a student services librarian.  
L:  Student services librarian?
R:  A teen services.  And I actually work with kids in lock up.  So kids --
L:  In lock up?
R:  -- that have re- -- yeah.  Like pre trial.  Kids, uh, who got called in for breaking probation or breaking and entering or murder or what ha-
