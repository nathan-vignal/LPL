L:  Hi there, I'm Dan.
R:  Hi, my name's Amanda. 
L:  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  I'm in Des Moines, Iowa. [LAUGH] 
L:  Cool.  Um, so do you have lots of friends and acquaintances?
R:  Um, I have a lot of acquaintances and, um, I would consider a lot of them friends, um, but mostly as far as people that -- I mean, I'm not sure what they mean by close friends, um, for very, very close ones, I probably only have two or three.
L:  Yeah, that's seems about --
R:  How about yourself? [LAUGH] 
L:  No, that's about right.  Well, I suppose, I moved from, ah, Albuquerque to Los Angeles and of course I had a good, big group of friends there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we're all pretty close and I -- I'd say there were probably, like, I don't know, anywhere from ten to fifteen people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that were all friends.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then moving here, um, you know, making new friends [NOISE] over the last year, I'd say that it's probably steadily grown from acquaintances to friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I don't know, like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- in terms of close friends, I'd probably have, yeah, maybe three or four --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it seems like the close friends, it takes -- well, for me anyway, it takes year- -- a few years before I can actually trust someone to consider them close and actually open up and -- and tell them a little bit more about myself other than just the surface things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] before they -- I think if they care, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause ... [MN]
L:  [NOISE] It may -- it might be, I don't know, 'cause, like, my good friend, probably, like, my currently my best friend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is still in Albuquerque and I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- suppose, like, as soon as I met him -- I -- it might be different for guys --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it didn't take long to, like, just be, like, instantaneously, like, we were buddies, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So I don't know if it's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I mean, I know it's, like, you know, like, a relationship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with a woman, ah, romantic relationship, it takes time to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- develop trust, but I think with, like, with me and, like, other guy friends, we either click instantaneously or we don't at all.
R:  Yeah, well that's nice.  Ah, that'd be a nice part of [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it seems like, with women, um, I don't know, I -- I guess I've had a lot of bad relat- -- bad friendships and so I have a lot of trust issues with a lot of women.  Um, I think a lot of 'em can be very manipulative and spiteful [LAUGH] --
L:  Really?
R:  -- so for -- so for, I think, a woman -- and it seems like all my other friends feel the same way, and I don't know, maybe it's women in general, they feel, like, you might have that -- you always have to have the initial chemistry of a friendship, like you have to actually like the person or feel like you click with them, but then to actually feel like you're gonna talk closely to them or open up to them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, like, you have to be sure they're not gonna go and run and tell everybody else or be making fun of you behind your back [LAUGH] type thing.
L:  Right. 
R:  It's pretty -- pretty childish, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but that's the way it happens sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  That is the w- -- that's -- that's very true.
L:  I don't know, like, when -- 'cause my wife and I mo- -- both moved here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, like, I came for graduate school --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so, like, I was instantan- -- like, I was instantly put into a situation where there were only, like, twelve people in my program and we were all studying the same thing, so we all kind of had --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- similar interest, and so it was much easier for me to find a good group of kind of acquaintances --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to develop friendships within, whereas --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my wife just went straight in to work and I think in, like, especially, like, in work context, it's much more difficult to meet people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, eve- -- and then even, like, so, like, meeting people is difficult and then getting close to anyone is much --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more difficult.  Um --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  You always get afraid if you invite 'em out or something they'll be like, "Oh, great", you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wanna make sure they like you first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  No, that's exactly right.
R:  For sure[?].
L:  So she's had a much more difficult time [MN] developing friendships in the last year or so than I have.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- it's a lot harder for women.
L:  It --
R:  It shouldn't be, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  I think it could be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I mean she's -- and she's always kind of been more reserved than I have in terms of getting to know people and opening up and stuff like that --
R:  Oh, yeah, right.
L:  -- and so, like, she's probably got two really, like, best friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think, I don't know, maybe, like, I'm probably less intense. [MN] I mean, my friendships are possibly less intense or -- than hers.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, like, my guy friends, it's, like, I could go a long time without talking to a good -- what I consider a good, good friend and I would still consider them that, you know what I mean?
R:  Right, yeah --
L:  And I suppose that's --
R:  -- my husband says the same thing all the time too. 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's, like, it doesn't, I -- I -- I -- I guess I don't need to talk to a [MN] -- a good friend in order for them to be a good friend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That sounds weird, but ...
R:  Yeah, I know what you mean though, 'cause -- but it is, like, a totally different code, it seems like [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- for the women because my husband and my brother actually really -- were really best friends and he moved out to Chicago and -- and my brother had ran in to some problems with his -- with his family and everything and it -- and to me, I guess I would have been right there and -- and just, you know -- of course I was as a sister, but I felt, like, you know, kinda pushing my husband, but he's like, "Our relationship's not like that.  We're close but we don't, you know, we don't have to -- have to delve into feelings and all that stuff in order for the -- each other to know we're there for each other".
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  So ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I think --
R:  I can see that. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know, like my guy friends, like it's much more, like, in the kinda stuff that we do for each other is much more -- less emotional and probably more practical.  Like, I'd be the first guy --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, if he was in trouble or needed money or anything, I'd give him money --
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  -- but we'd probably -- or I'd, you know, help him move or whatever, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, I don't know, yeah ...
R:  Yeah, that's -- I can -- that -- that makes sense, I guess I'd never really thought about it that much, but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ha. 
L:  No --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, and in terms of acquaintances, I don't know, Los Angeles is crazy, so --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, is it?
L:  -- it's hard to meet -- meet anybody normal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] at all. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. 
L:  My [LAUGH] -- um --
R:  Where did you come from did you say again?
L:  Ah, well I originally -- like, I moved from Albuquerque, but I'm originally from De- --
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  -- from Detroit.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I lived in Albuquerque for, like, eight years, so I had a long time to, um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to get friend- -- you know, to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Albuquerque's a really small town, I mean, like --
R:  Oh, is it?  I -- oh --
L:  I know, maybe --
R:  -- I guess I didn't know that.
L:  -- not compared to -- it's got, like, five hundred thousand people.
R:  Oh, yeah, well, yeah, Des Moines is, like, not even that -- probably not even that big. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
R:  It's probably -- it's the biggest -- supposed to be the biggest city in Iowa, but I mean it's, like, the largest small town, you'll ever see, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's pretty funny, but ... [LAUGH] 
L:  That is funny.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I -- I say that Albuquerque is a small town compared to Los Angeles, because --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.
L:  -- Los Angeles has got, like, ten million people and --
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- constant, constant activity.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But so, like, I don't know, in Albuquerque, I guess when I say it's a small town, it's, like, it's -- it -- it was easy to figure out, kind of, who was who, what was --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- you know, like what --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- the cultural scene was like and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, all the -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, the parts of town, whereas Los Angeles is just a monster and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's, like, you can't -- you know, it's hard to have normal human contact with --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- anybody, seriously.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I mean it's crazy.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, um, so I mean, I'm really grateful that I was in the graduate -- that I'm -- that I'm in the graduate program I'm in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because, like I said, there's a group of people with s- something like similar interests --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and based on that kind of common shared interest, you can then -- I can then, um, you know, differentiate, like, you know, who I'm most like, and who I like and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who is nice and who's not.  Although, it's weird going to graduate school 'cause it's much more like middle school than --
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  -- it's -- yeah, well because we're in [MN] -- um, there's a very limited number of us --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like, you know what I mean, it's like being in a small classroom with --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the same people over and over again.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the competitions and the jealousies and all that kinda stuff [NOISE] really get inflated.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  Huh.
L:  I mean, it's real- --
R:  I guess it makes sense, you know [inaudible] --
L:  No, it doesn't make any sense.  I mean --
R:  Oh, you don't think so? [LAUGH] I guess maybe I'm not --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- familiar with what graduate class really is.  I would think that's for special students that are higher above -- if it's a small class --
L:  Well --
R:  -- then aren't you, like, probably whatever you're specializing in is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is rare [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rare to have that --
L:  Yeah, no --
R:  -- many --
L:  -- we're all good --
R:  -- people in it but ...
L:  We're all going to be, um, [MN] film scholars.  We're going to --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- teach film.  And so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, yeah, it's pretty specialized and we're all pretty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's a bunch of really smart people and so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you'd think that t- the level of [LAUGH] maturity --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- would be higher --
R:  I can see that --
L:  -- but, no.
R:  -- yeah, I see what you're saying now. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it's, like, we all are competing for the same scholarships and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we're all trying to [MN] be better than each other, 'cause there --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- is such a small group. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the -- I don't know, I just think any time you put a bunch of people, like -- I don't know, its weird, like, when you -- it's really emotionally intense because the -- there's so much pressure on us --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- to do well and so, I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It -- it -- rivalry's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Yeah --
L:  What kind of --
R:  Sorry.
L:  Do you make friends mostly at work or ...?
R:  Well, I've lived in Iowa my whole life and I lived in a small town first and then we moved to Des Moines about four years ago, but it's only about an hour and forty five minutes away from where I grew up and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and the -- just basically, um, friends through my -- my church --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and fr- friends from working and, um, that's pretty much it.  I -- I -- like I said, I have a lot of acquaintances a- -- everywhere, but actual close friends that I would actually go out and do things with, is probably only a group of three or four women --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then -- if you add the men into that -- the couples is -- we have, like, I mean, that makes it up to be the eight. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  Sure. 
R:  -- but as far as women goes that [COUGH] is kinda hard and so I don't know, and a lot of them are related to me.  Like my mom I would consider, you know, one of my friends, and my sister and -- but they don't live here, but ...
L:  Right. 
R:  But it's kinda --
L:  Generally all live within --
R:  -- more that way. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- Iowa, right?
R:  Yes, very --
L:  Yeah, in --
R:  -- friendly and you kinda know where everybody's at, type thing too, so ...
L:  Yeah, I would think that living in the [MN] --
