R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Kristy.
L:  Hi, I'm Daniel.
R:  Hi, Daniel.
L:  How you doing?
R:  Fine.
L:  Good.
R:  We get to talk about food, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yay.
L:  That's -- that's today's topic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I like food. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yes, I do too.  Food is good.
R:  Yeah.  In fact I'm --
L:  So which do you prefer?
R:  Huh?
L:  Which do you prefer?
R:  You know what?  I already forgot what they had asked.  Something about eating out or eating at --
L:  Or at home.
R:  -- at home?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that's a toughie.  I don't eat out that much, but when I do I enjoy it a lot.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's the same.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Although for me right now, I'd love to eat out 'cause I'm a college student and I'm kind of broke --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm kind of starving. [LAUGH]
R:  Now, let's see, you probably know where every pizza joint in -- in town is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And fast food place.
R:  Right.  Well, dorm food was not that hot once -- you know, now that I remember.  It wasn't that good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] um, what kind of foods do you like?
L:  Ah, all kinds of foods [LAUGH] right now.
R:  Do you --
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I like, ah, international food.
R:  Yeah, I was just going to say, if you had a choice between, like, Mexican and Italian, which --
L:  I'd choose Mexican.
R:  You know what, it's such a -- I -- I think Italian edges it out a little bit for me.
L:  You think so? [MN]
R:  Oh, Mexican's a s- -- a very close second [LAUGH] though.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  What's the most unusual, um, international cuisine that you've eaten?
L:  I, um -- calamari, squid.
R:  Oh my gosh.  Is that what I think it is?  Is it squid?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh my Gosh.
L:  It's pretty good though.
R:  Really?  What's it taste --
L:  Have you ever had it?
R:  No, no, what's it taste like?
L:  It tastes like meat, but it has a sweet -- I guess they sweet -- seasoned it with sweet -- sweet stuff.  But it was pretty good though.
R:  Well, if it's sweet I could probably do it.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  I've eaten shark before.
L:  You've had shark?
R:  Yeah, it -- they say, "Oh, it tastes like chicken".  Of course they say frog legs cha- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- taste like chicken, but I don't know, I kind of like hamburger. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, hamburgers and subs and pizza for me.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Right.
L:  So where are you located right now?
R:  Ah, I'm in Indianapolis.
L:  Okay, I'm in Los Angeles.  So there's a lot of --
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Yeah, so there's a lot of Mexican food out here.
R:  Oh, I was going to say.  Oh, absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I used to live out in Arizona and, you know, that was just second nature.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, ah, you know, actually here in Indianapolis we have got a big thriving Hispanic, ah, community now.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And there are authentic Mexican places almost on every corner.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In fact, there's one just down the street that my neighbour and I, we love to go to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, it's just really neat.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I like, like, that they have taco places out there that makes Mexican food and it -- it beats out Taco Belle any day.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's -- it -- there really is no comparison.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, my parents still live out in Arizona and they said, "Well, you were raised on real Mexican food, how could --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, "How could you eat that junk at Taco Belle?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Well, are you going to be eating out tonight?
L:  No, I'm going to eat macaroni and cheese. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Golly, you're taking me back.  I've -- it's been twenty years since I've been out of college but --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- when I lived in a house with other room mates, it was like Pete's Pride pork fritters [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and macaroni and cheese --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and --
L:  And noodles?
R:  -- hot dogs. 
L:  -- and noodles.
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's not going to last for long and soon you'll be eating like a king.
L:  Yeah, hopefully. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, do you have a couple more years to go?
L:  Um, I'm about three years to go.
R:  Oh.  Well, hang in there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, not that I eat like a queen every day, but ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] The college degree does help you get better food on the table. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  That -- that's what I'm looking forward to right now.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Good food.
R:  Well, it's probably only about one thirty there?
L:  Um, two thirty, two twenty actually.
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  Two twenty five.
R:  -- we're only two hours apart.  Well, it's four thirty in Indianapolis.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm being a boring housewife today.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] My, ah -- I -- I'm a teacher, so, um --
L:  Oh, you're a teacher?
R:  Yeah, so in the summer it's -- it's kind of neat to have the time off, but then you get quickly bored and you're like, "I want something to do". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I guess I'll go work in a restaurant. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So you get free food?
R:  Yeah, that's true.  You know what?  There are benefits.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There really are.  When I worked in the dorm.  I went to IU.
L:  Okay.
R:  I worked in the dorm and got a lot of free food.
L:  Okay.
R:  Even though it was terrible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  So, what grade do you teach?
R:  [MN] Um, primarily first --
L:  Oh, okay, so you [MN] --
R:  -- and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Well, sometimes they -- they -- it's first grade and then we loop on up and teach second grade.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And then we go back down to first. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  So, do you, ah -- of course we're getting off the subject here of food, but what are y- -- what are you going to do when you get out of school?
L:  Um, I'm a computer information systems major.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  So ...
R:  You've -- you've got a job. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You've got a definite job.  Good for you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, it is raining here and windy.  In fact there is a thunder storm coming, um --
L:  Oh, man.
R: They said that we need to talk ten full minutes?
L:  Yeah, they're going to let us know when it's been ten minutes.
R:  They'll let us know.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  This your first time on this?
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Have -- have you done it a couple of times?
L:  Yeah.  This is my third time.
R:  Oh, that's go- -- oh, that's right.  Now, we can only do it I think three times?
L:  Yeah, three times.
R:  Yeah, well I -- I'll definitely be doing it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can you hear that thunder?
L:  Oh yeah.  I -- I hear it, yeah.
R:  Yeah, there's -- I'm standing right by the -- oh, my goodness.  I just hope we don't get lightening 'cause we might get disconnected and I'll go deaf. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, well let's see.  We got to get back to food.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Food, food, food.
L:  So, yeah, eating in a restaurant it -- it's just so much simpler, you know?  You go there, tell them what you want and they bring it for you.
R:  Oh, you know what?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is nice.  I'm a single mom [MN] and, ah, I'm doing -- I usually do all the cooking here at home --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it is such a treat to go out and -- and be served.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely.  And, um, I'm always profusely thanking the -- the server and I start tidying up and [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's such a mom thing, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's nothing like a nice glass of wine and --
L:  Mm.  Well, I can't drink yet, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, you can't?
L:  I'm only twenty.
R:  Oh, don't do that then.  Don't do that.
L:  I won't.
R:  You'll get carded and taken away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, golly, you're making me want to go out to eat tonight. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hadn't planned on that either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, but, um, let's see.  So the weir- -- is the weirdest thing you've ever eaten calamari?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that the weirdest?
L:  Yeah, squid.
R:  I guess shark is the weirdest I've eaten then.
L:  Shark, huh?
R:  I can't think of anything else.
L:  Have you ever eaten deer?
R:  You know what?  One time.
L:  Yeah, it is --
R:  What do you think of it?
L:  It's not bad.
R:  You know, i- it was hard.  It -- it -- it is, you know, like they say, a little stringy and stuff.  Um, a friend of mine had shot it --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- and, ah, had my ex husband and I over and -- and served it to us and didn't tell us what it was.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I thought it was kind of strange.
L:  It is kind of tough.
R:  And -- yeah.  And then he told me and I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm eating Bambi, I cannot do this". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I cannot do this. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I guess if you're desperate enough you'll -- you'll eat anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're not eating out of dumpsters yet, right?
L:  No, no.
R:  I mean, you got macaroni and cheese.
L:  And noodles.
R:  Good. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And cereal in the mornings.
R:  Don't you feel like you're going to turn into a noodle?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Are your parents nearby?
L:  Um, actually I'm from Ohio.
R:  Oh, they're not nearby at all.
L:  No.
R:  I bet your mom worries about what you eat.
L:  All the time.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  All the time.
R:  She probably --
L:  Every day she asks me, "Hey, what did you eat today?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- I -- and I say nothing.  She says, "Oh, you got to eat". [LAUGH]
R:  It's true, you do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is she a good cook?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Your mother, is she a good cook?
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Oh, I bet you miss her cooking.
L:  Yeah, I'm going to be going home this weekend actually 'cause --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- 'cause school's over.
R:  Oh, well, congratulations, you made it through another year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You go home and you stock up on your mom's food and -- and you get --
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- and you get that weight back on you and take as much of her food back as you can. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Oh, well it has been so nice talking to you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, I think they're playing with us.  I -- I -- it's been over ten minutes.
L:  You think so?
R:  I think so.
L:  Oh.
R:  Have you been timing it?
L:  No, I haven't been timing it.  Um, it should be like six or seven, becau- because it's going to tell us it's been ten minutes and it is -- it's going to say, "Say your goodbyes" and then it's going to hang up.
R:  Aren't I a very suspicious person? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, well, you've been easy to talk to.
L:  Yeah, this is good.
R:  Um, I just -- I just can't t- -- I mean, food, I love food.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's important, you need it to live, but --
L:  Yeah.  Just talking for ten minutes on it?
R:  Huh?
L:  Just -- you mean, you can't talk for --
R:  Well, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I -- I -- [MN] I don't know, I guess if I -- food was what I thought of when I woke up in the morning until I go ho- -- bed at night I could talk more about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But if I could eat anything I wanted without gaining one pound --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my favorite food type is, like, cakes and candy and doughnuts --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Will we ever grow up?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I have a sweet tooth too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's -- it -- it -- I tell you what, if there was a box of doughnuts in front of me right now I couldn't say no. 
L:  It's wouldn't last? [LAUGH]
R:  I'd have to have -- yeah, I'd have to have one.  I love cakes and cookies and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So ...  But I guess I know when to stop --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- because --
L:  That's the most important thing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  You don't want to be big as a house. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, that's a really terrible thing for me to say.  I mean, I have no idea how much you weigh. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm fairly thin.  I've been losing weight since I came here.
R:  Oh, I was going to say, if you're not eating very much, you're just eating noodles [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you're probably very, very thin. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm very active also so that doesn't help.
R:  Oh, you know that I miss those days at -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- college because you're walking everywhere.  I took a lot of phys ed classes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And of course you're starving --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, 'cause you can't afford food. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, shoot.  [MN] Well, is this the last time you can do this study?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, well
