L:  Hello.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  M- my name's Eva.
L:  My name's Kate.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too. 
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm in Ohio.  Where are you?
R:  I am in Wisconsin.
L:  In the what?
R:  Uh, Wisconsin.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Um, so what do you like better?  To eat at home or at a restaurant?
L:  I guess it depends.  
R:  Yeah, I know.  It really depends for me too.
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean, I like to eat at restaurants.
R:  [MN]  What kind of restaurant do you like to eat at?  Like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- slow food or fast food or ...?
L:  Uh, slow food.  
R:  Slow?
L:  Except for I hate taking the kids to slow food. 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I bet.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know, um, I like -- uh, it really depends for me too because, um, my fiance's from Jamaica so we like his type of food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we don't get that a -- a lot up here.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's not many restaurants for that.  So we probably prefer to eat at home usually.  Just because of that reason.  But ...  I don't know [MN] --
L:  Oh.  I see.  Yeah. 
R:  Go ahead.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You prefer to eat at home 'cause you don't have restaurants?
R:  Yeah.  But as far as like fast food and stuff, I think -- I think the reason I prefer to eat at fast food when I do is because I just don't have time to cook.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm on the go all the time.  So ...
L:  Yeah, that's how -- the way I am.  
R:  'Cause I really -- I love to cook when I have time.  But ...
L:  See I -- I hate cooking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You hate cooking?
L:  I mean, I don't hate it just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't -- it's just there's no -- never enough time in the day.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause it --
L:  You know, it gets so late and then you're like, oh, gosh, I gotta make dinner so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  By the time I get home from work, I swear for like the last month we've been eating pure cereals for supper.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Because by the time I get home from work it's just about six o'clock and -- and my fiance's got to get up at four in the morning so we go to bed early and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just -- if I want to have time to eat and watch a little bit of TV before bed, you know, I just don't have time for all that.
L:  Right.  
R:  So make a bowl of cereal.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's what we -- I don't get home 'til about six and my husband gets home about six thirty.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [SIGH]  And then we gotta, you know, round up the kids.  They want to go out and play.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially in the summertime it's -- it's a lot -- it's a lot easier just to, like, order pizza than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- th- than make -- make dinner.
R:  And there's, yeah --
L:  Or stop and pick something up.
R:  Mhm.  And, um, my fiance gets home at, you know, like three thirty and I get home at six, so by the time I get home he's already mo- most likely eaten.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's no use making it for myself so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  [COUGH]  But ...
L:  And of course the man's not gonna make dinner.
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Definite.  He used to when we first met.  But ... 
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  A little bit.
L:  Just to suck you in.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Um, yeah, but I don't know.  I like once in a while to go out maybe for like fish fry or something like that.  Um, just to go out and -- maybe on a weekend and just relax at a restaurant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and enjoy yourself.  That's about -- we don't do it too often though.  Normally --
L:  We don't -- we don't -- we don't do it too often either.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, we usually --
R:  Normally --
L:  We usually just eat at home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean some things now have gotten so easy to make.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like my husband loves those packaged things where everything comes together and you just add water [MN] and, you know.
R:  You're lucky.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Huh?
R:  You're lucky to have a husband that loves that.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's nice.  That's really nice.
L:  Yeah.  So I can, you know, those only take like five minutes.  Put 'em in the oven and ...
R:  Yeah.  I know, um, my fiance likes rice and, like, curried chicken and curried goat and stuff that takes a while to prepare so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's more of a weekend thing.
L:  Yeah, it's hard to -- it's hard to make -- make foods at nighttime during the week.
R:  Yeah.  And he's not like a pizza person so ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Makes it a lot harder.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  'Cause he didn't, um, he wasn't introduced to pizza until he came up here, like, eight years ago so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  And we're going down to Jamaica, my first time down there, next month so I can't wait to try their foods too.  See how different they are.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  It should be exciting.  
L:  Yeah, I bet that'll be ...
R:  See how his family cooks and stuff.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Maybe bring some of that back here and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- learn how to cook a little bit better here for him.  
L:  [LAUGH]  There you go.  Maybe she has some tricks at --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing it fast.  
R:  Yeah.  So have you -- have you done this before?  This phone thing?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Have you?
R:  Yeah.  I have.  This is my third time.
L:  This is my third time too.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Oh, I keep missing the calls all week.  
R:  Yeah.  I just -- everytime I've been getting them it has been a bad time so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Today I'm like, okay, I'm putting down my bowl of [LAUGH] cereal ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm gonna take this call.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's what the neighbor just called too and said she, um, she asked if I was making dinner.  She wanted me to pick up something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so -- see we're eating out tonight.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Best way to do it sometimes.  
L:  It's just so ea- -- uh, but it's so fattening.  
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  That's what I hate about ...  
R:  I know.  And the only low fat thing you can get is either a salad which tastes like crap.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or Subway, which after a while it gets old and it's expensive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, seriously, I don't know of any other fast food that -- that's good for you.
L:  No.  I mean, uh, I mean, if you go -- if you go to a sit down place --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sometimes you can get something.  I mean, you can get a salad.
R:  Or a grilled --
L:  Those are typically better.
R:  -- chicken sandwich.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Or something like that.
L:  You got a lot more variety but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's what now we've been eating out a lot 'cause I'm pregnant.
R:  Oh, are ya?
L:  Yeah, and I said, uh, actually, we might as well eat out now because we won't be when I have this baby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's true.  Enjoy yourself now.
L:  [LAUGH]  'Cause then I'll be --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  I won't be wanting to.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  I don't know, and then at -- of course, at work, you know, it's always fast food or else I'll grab a slim fast for lunch, you know and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  
L:  That's what -- I mean, lunchtime you don't really get enough time either.  
R:  No.  I think that's where restaurants make their most money, you know.  'Cause who -- what else are you supposed to eat at lunch?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you're at work all day.  
L:  And not that many people pack. 
R:  No.
L:  A lot of businesses don't have refrigerators or stuff.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  I didn't really think about that.  
L:  I know my husband he -- he buys his lunch everyday.
R:  Yeah.  And that gets expensive.
L:  And -- yeah, and it gets old too.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, very much so.  
L:  [NOISE]  So ...
R:  Oh, well.  I don't know how much stuff there is to talk about on food.
L:  I don't know what else.
R:  I know.
L:  Where are you going?  
R:  I'm gonna check my phone, see how long we've been talking.
L:  +Check your what?
R:  My phone.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Hold on -- hold on one sec.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Mine says eleven minutes and twenty seconds, but I was on the line waiting for a while.  
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Just for them to find somebody.  So ...  Should be coming upon it pretty soon though.  
L:  [NOISE]  So, what else?  What else can we talk about food?
R:  [LAUGH]  You have a garden that you grow vegetables in?
L:  Oh, no way.  [LAUGH]  
R:  No?  [LAUGH]  Me neither.
L:  I'm not that crafty.  
R:  I tried it like a couple a years ago and they all just [LAUGH] shriveled up and died on me so ...  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I fear that's good enough.
L:  I have a hard time keeping my plants alive.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's funny, my plants at home all die and my plants at work, like, flourish.  I don't know.  Must be the lighting.  
L:  Maybe.  See that's the way it is here too.  I have one plant at work that's been alive for two years.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, my daughter is two and a half.  My youngest.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it was at my office before she was born --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's still alive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now if I can have a plant like that at home I'd have a garden.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  And then I have two birds and they always eat my plants too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So that's not much luck there.  [LAUGH]  And I try to put their cage right by the window where the plants are so that everything can get it's light [COUGH] but that don't work out real well.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't know.
L:  Nothing ever does.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At home.  
R:  Yeah.  I know.  But I have probably like [MN] probably close to eight or ten plants at work and they do awesome.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  I don't know what that's really got to do with food but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  So is --
L:  Oh, there's only so much you can talk about food.
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.  [LAUGH]  So if we've like talked ten minutes before they -- isn't -- don't you have to talk like a minimum of eight minutes or something?
L:  I can't -- I can't remember how mu- how much it --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- it is.  I think ...
R:  Something.
L:  I'm surprised she hasn't come on yet.
R:  I know.  
L:  So maybe we should talk about some more food.  
R:  Yeah.  Let's see, um ...
L:  Well, what's, uh, what -- where do you like to eat out the most?
R:  Um ...
L:  Like a sit down place.
R:  Let me think.  We have so many, like, little restaurant and bar type places up here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- Wisconsin's full of bars.  [LAUGH]  But we have, um, a lot of, I don't know, Wisconsin I think is big on Friday night fish fries.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you guys have that?
L:  Yeah.  Well, just like during [inaudible] time.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But not -- not any other time here.
R:  Because we -- every Friday night there's like fish fries going on everywhere.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So that's kind of fun to go to sometimes.  You know, all you can eat fish.  [several inaudible words] and fish is pretty good so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  We like to do that.  Otherwise we like to travel, like every other weekend.  Um, so I try and look for any, like, Jamaican restaurants, Caribbean restaurants, you know, within driving distance --  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- from us within a few
