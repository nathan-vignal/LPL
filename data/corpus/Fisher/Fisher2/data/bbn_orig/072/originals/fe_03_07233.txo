R:  Hi.
L:  Hi there.  I'm Susan.
R:  Hi.  I'm Judy.  
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Hi.  You -- you too.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Seattle.  How 'bout you?
R:  Oh, wow.  Everything -- everybody else has been close to me.  I'm in Oklahoma.
L:  Oklahoma?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I did this once before and talked to someone in Illinois so that was kind of interesting.
R:  Huh.  Yeah.  Everybody else has been from Texas so ...
L:  Oh.  
R:  This -- this is my far away call. 
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, so I guess the topic.  
R:  Something about friends.  Do you have a lot of [LAUGH] friends?
L:  Uh, I don't know.  Um, I'm -- I'm probably the just a few close friends type person.  I guess I -- I have a lot of acquaintances.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, but really only a few who are really good, good friends.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  What about you?
R:  I think -- I don't -- I guess -- don't you think that's true for everyone, like I -- I guess I know someone everywhere I go and I don't -- I feel like I know a lot of people but I wouldn't say about [inaudible] -- I didn't -- it's hard to have a lot of close friends, I think.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, uh, I mean, I guess, you know, I maybe have five pretty close friends and, I don't know ...
L:  Do you have like a group or ...?
R:  I don't know how to juggle that many more friends.  I'm sorry?
L:  I said, do you have like a group or do you have a ...?
R:  Yeah, I would say we just have a -- we have a group of people and I'm [inaudible] you have maybe one or two close friends not in it but there's about three or four of us just in a group.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess that's how it works.  But ... 
L:  See with me, I have --
R:  I [several inaudible words] I don't even -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Oh no, go ahead.  
R:  Well, I was just gonna say like I feel like I'm, you know, I'm always, you know, people are always calling me and I have to do other stuff.  I -- I don't know now I'd manage having a lot of close friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like I would just -- don't have that much time in the day or -- or in the week to see everyone and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ...
L:  I think there's some people though who really don't have many close friends because, I mean, even more than like one.  Because they don't, um, form bonds that well.  You know what I mean?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  So, [MN] I think -- and also I think it depends on just what your life situation is.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I have -- like my best friend I've known my -- just about my entire life, or at least her entire life.  As we grew up three houses away and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- our friendship has managed to survive me moving three thousand [LAUGH] miles away.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Even though we don't talk as much as we would like it's still like we can sort of pick up right where we left off.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But then other friends, it just seems less, like a less of a staying power, you know, like if I move to a different part of the country or they move to a different part of the country it's so hard to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- keep up with it.  
R:  Well, even like a -- I, uh, I'm in college still and, uh, I recently switched majors and everybody that I used to see so often and like valued spending time with so much I just don't see anymore and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I feel like I'm just not a part of them.  And I thought they, you know, were my pretty good friends.  And, but you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thing just -- like some things just change so quickly and --
L:  Yeah.  Well, do you live pretty where near you -- pretty near where you grew up?
R:  Yeah, I live in the same town.
L:  The same town?
R:  Yeah, so ...  I mean, and now I get to see people that I went to high school with and wasn't very -- I mean, like it was just kind of, you know, knew of and now we're -- now we're good friends.  So I feel like even people like just go from friends to acquaintances kind of and, uh, I don't see people that I haven't -- you know, people I used to be really good friends with I just, you know, never see anymore and I just [inaudible] they all changed places.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, I guess, these are what I was taught about when I started college.  You know, going to college in the same town I grew up in.  I just didn't meet anyone.  And there are so many like socializers in college, and they were like neat people, and I was just like, I don't feel like I need to meet anyone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I talked to a -- I mean, it was kind of funny.  I was talking about, ew, my college friend.  I made my first college friend.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  So [several inaudible words].
L:  Are you living on campus?
R:  No.  Well, I -- I mean I live just off of campus.  But not in campus housing so ...
L:  But you moved out of your parents' house and ...?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  
L:  Yeah, I found -- actually when I was in college I had, like, two big groups of friends.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like they're maybe, I don't know, ten, like ten people in each group so I actually had a pretty big social circle there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But then after I left, you know, I'm also -- like I'm thirty four, well, almost thirty four --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I also find like people getting in relationships and getting married and things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their social circles get --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a lot smaller.  And I'm also, you know, I'm getting to the age where some of my friends are starting to [LAUGH] divorce.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  So, um, they're looking for new friends.
R:  Yeah.  I gu- -- I remember thinking about that when I was little.  I don't know, maybe like eight.  I asked my father who his best friend was.  And he goes, well, your mother's my best friend, you know.  And then I was like, well, who are your other friends?  And he said like, "Judith, uh, adults just don't have as many friends as, you know, kids".  Like your life becomes your family more and, I don't know, I'm kind of looking forward to that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- part of life.  Like, you know, there's so -- there's just so much.  It seems like we have large social circles and there's just drama and people who don't get along and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I'd like to -- I'd like to think people all grow out of that.  I -- I guess they probably don't but it's nice to --
L:  Oh, I think that, yeah ...
R:  -- think that everybody grows up and ...
L:  Well, to a certain extent but you still have some drama, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the cir- the circles get a lot smaller so there are fewer people to have drama with.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You [LAUGH] know.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So you just run into a lot less people.  Um, God, I was gonna say something else and I totally spaced.  Um, oh, about, like, about like being in relationships and everything.  I think it's good if you have a good relationship with that person as your best friend and everything.  But I also think it's important for people to maintain friends outside the relationship because that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- can really help.  That helps keep balance a lot.  I think it's real easy to isolate within a relationship.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then you kind of, like if the relationship has trouble, or whatever, you really need people to kind of turn too.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it is that with a friend who's just been with a guy forever and we really dislike him, but you can see like when things are bad we suddenly get a lot more calls from her and I just feel like does she want to call all the time but she's just content and only when she's not content.  I don't know.  You kind of feel pushed aside.  Like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she still needs to give more time and then like, she knows she's just, you know, we're just twenty and --
L:  Mm
R:  -- I mean, she [MN] would spend more time with her friends and less in a relationship.  Like enjoy being young and enjoy, you know, I just think you lose something when you push aside your friends for a man and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially when --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you're so young.  
L:  Yeah, I think that's really true.  I mean people start to feel neglected and then you have -- then you end up like looking like a fair weather friend and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or a foul weather friend [LAUGH] actually.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, you know, I think then it just causes a little bit of a rift in the friendship and that's why I think it's really hard -- I mean, it's really important when people are in relationships to work to maintain their friends even in, you know, in good times and bad.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I feel like now finally, though, like, you know, when we're getting into the real meat of our majors in college.  You see people -- like I just never realized people would get so busy and it's hard to keep a friendship going.  Like I feel like I'm really working at it more now than ever.  Like making sure I call people and try to find a time and making activities.  Like I just feel like when I was growing up you didn't have to do that.  Like thing -- like time wasn't so precious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in high school and -- and the first few years of college, but now it's just the most -- the most important thing is the time.  Getting more time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I feel like I'm putting more work in to sustain your relationships and now that people move away and, I don't know.  I'm learn- -- [MN] you know, it's like -- it's just a whole new way to think about friendships and like, you know, really good friends live far away now.  And ...  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, you don't have to talk to them everyday.  Like I know what you're saying, like with your best friend like people I haven't seen in six months [inaudible] and everything's wonderful again.  And ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  You can't -- you can't push it too hard.  You can't want to talk to that person everyday and that's what's so hard.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I guess, you know, if you're meant to be friends with someone you'll stay with them.  And I think I'm just now learning that.  And I'm really glad it's proven to be true so far.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  Well, I think the older that you get the more you have to work to maintain --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- friendships.  I mean, yeah, I remember when I was kid it was just like, you know, uh, call somebody up.  "Want to go do something"?  You [LAUGH] know and ...
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And you go do something.  And -- or like you see everybody in your classes in school because you're all going to the same classes together.  Then in college it gets harder 'cause you go to different colleges or if you're in the same college you have different majors.  [LIPSMACK]  And then you meet new friends.  But then once you're out of college, boy, [MN] you know.  I think it -- it gets even harder.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  To try to maintain -- I mean, you hear -- see people like, you know, trying to go out and join clubs and things like that, just to try to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- meet new people.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, you know, like I think when we're young we really kind of take it for granted, like new people come to us.  Whereas --
R:  Yeah.  And [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- when you're older --
R:  -- get stuck doing the same thing.  I -- like not -- not to say it's a bad thing but things seem to get a little more steady when you're -- when you're an adult.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, you're not changing jobs and people don't get hired so often and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  I work in a --
L:  Also --
R:  Oh, go ahead.
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  Oh, I was just going to say I work in a really kind of small restaurant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So you get pretty close to everybody who works there and then a lot of the people I work with have become really good friends of mine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- but then it's trying -- you know, like there's a transition from work friend to friend.  But, you know, it's hard to juggle working with someone you're such good friends with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh -- I -- I -- that's just something I notice about my friendships.  So many of them come from work and then you don't want to -- and then you're not really supposed to work with those people anymore if you're such good friends and we don't get as much work done and ...  [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that's kind of -- that's kind of tricky.  Like trying to work my life around getting to see those people but working at different times from them and -- and feel like that's -- that's my new hassle right now.  Like such good friends and so many people at work and ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was going to bring up a similar issue where, like, I've -- there are a lot of people that I work with and I really get along with really well but, you know, we haven't made that jump from work friends to outside friends.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]  Personally I think because I am in a relationship and so -- and -- and they are too.  So it's like --
R:  Uh-huh.
