R:  Hi, my name is Kathy.
L:  Hi, this is Pam.
R:  Hi, Pam.
L:  Hi.  How are you?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm real good.  I have, um, a couple close -- really close friends.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That I kind of keep close to me.  I don't, um, I'm friendly with everybody but I only have a few close friends that I talk to one of them and go out and maybe go to a movie or whatever with.  What about you?
L:  Oh, we sound like we'd be pretty much the same [LAUGH] because that's about how I am.  I have more -- I prefer to have closer, more meaningful friendships.  You know rather --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than having a lot of friends who --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would, you know, not be there for you in a pinch.  [LAUGH]  You know.  
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  That type of thing.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Like I like to keep myself, um, not spread too thin.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I'm friendly with everybody at work but there's one girl that I'm really close with.  That's it.  And then I have my childhood friends and my high school friends that I still kinda associate with.  But other than that, that's it.  And my daughter is like my best friend.  And she's twenty one, gonna be twenty two, so I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is that out of the norm?  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, that's really neat.  Uh, there's -- uh, there -- I have several friends who actually consider their mothers one of their best friends.  I don't think it's out of the norm at [LAUGH] all.  
R:  Right.  
L:  No, my best friends [LAUGH] well, unfortunately, are back in North Dakota, my home state, and most of them live out of state [LAUGH] from where I'm at so right now I'm kind of in a transitional period and mo- -- my best friend lives in -- well, one of them lives in Minneapolis.  The other one lives in Phoenix.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I've got several other is in, uh, Washington metro area.  Uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] sort of thing so ...  Right here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- right now, kinda like more acquaintances than I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- actually around, but I keep in close contact with my real close friends via email and that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- type of thing so I -- I love --
R:  Right.  That's -- 
L:  -- email.  It's so much --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- better.  I'm not a letter writer at [LAUGH] all.  
R:  Right.  And it's so good 'cause it's for the now.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it got there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Well, and then there's a two way exchange rather than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- okay, I asked ten questions and I never get an answer because by the time somebody writes you back, and it's not their fault, everybody does it.  I do it too.  
R:  Sure.
L:  You know, you just don't [COUGH] you don't really look back at somebody's letter.  You just write your own thing so nobody -- and I think, seems like nobody's questions ever get answered kind of thing.
R:  Right.  Sure.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  That's true.  That's --
L:  And it --
R:  -- really true.  'Cause --
L:  [LAUGH]  That's why I like email so ...
R:  Uh-huh.  My girlfriend, um, from just childhood, we came up together and what not.  She lives in Florida now and I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So she -- we email back and forth but like if we didn't have that, I mean, how many times do you get to really pick up the phone?  You don't.  You don't or the cost is always involved.  When you get on the computer it's just there.  You can pretty much say what you want.  The only thing that's missing is the expression, you know.  
L:  Exactly.  But, you know, I like, uh, like have you used Yahoo messenger or the MSN messenger at all?  Or do you just do the regular email?
R:  We do -- we -- I do --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- um, AOL instant messenger.  
L:  Okay.  I [inaudible] --
R:  We do that.
L:  Okay.
R:  And then there's something attached to that that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- called AIM.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So we get into that too but, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- pretty much, you know, it's a little bit of both.  They're not always because their times are different.  I have a girlfriend in Florida and then one in, um, Vegas.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And their times are different from me so sometimes I don't always get on at the same time they are on so sometimes email's the only way but it -- I like instant messenger the best.  
L:  Right.  I know I like -- I guess that's how I -- I keep in contact via email, like I say also, but I get on messenger quite a bit.  [MN]  On the Yahoo.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which I think is neat because they do have -- at least they have some of the expressions or they call, what, emoticons or whatever.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, you know, I do -- we do voice a lot.  
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Um, rather than just do the typing back and forth.  
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  Which I think is really --
R:  -- neat.
L:  -- neat.  Yeah.  Do you have -- [MN] does AOL have the voice option?  I -- I've never been on A -- I've never had AOL as a [inaudible]?
R:  No.  No.  
L:  Oh, no it --
R:  And I did not know all this.
L:  Oh, my gosh, those --
R:  That's awesome.
L:  Go on Yahoo.  It's a free account.  All you do is sign up for their messenger thing and, oh, yeah, you can -- you -- it just says invite person to act or you invite 'em to activate their -- [MN] as long as they've got speakers in their system, in their computer system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You can talk like that.  I even have, um, have a couple of friends [COUGH] who I work with right now that live, probably, about twenty miles from here but it's long distance as far --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the telephone, land phone.  And I talk to them on Yahoo all the time.  Voice [MN] activated.
R:  Oh, that's great.  
L:  Yeah.  Because, uh, then I don't have to pay for it so ...
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  [inaudible].  [LAUGH]  It works out well.  
R:  Right.  The phone companies are making their money aren't they?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
R:  I know.  'Cause if you do [MN] maybe three miles to the left of us it's, um, considered, uh, the suburbs.
L:  Mm.
R:  So then it's like a different area code.  It's so strange.
L:  Yeah, that is.
R:  So strange.  
L:  But yeah, you should check that out because it's really [inaudible].
R:  Oh, definitely.  I just wrote it down to write --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- myself a note because of I'm sitting in front of the computer right now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause I got my email for this so I figure let me hop on and try and do it.  
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  But --
L:  This is the first one I've done.  Is this the first one ...?
R:  You too?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Me too.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, I've never done it before so this is kind of strange for me.
L:  It is --
R:  A little bit different.
L:  It [several inaudible words].  It is [several inaudible words].  
R:  How did you hear?
L:  I, um, money and shopping dot com.  I'm a member of -- of that mystery shopping gazette.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Basically in a mystery shopping organization.
R:  Sure.  
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  And -- and they sent you something about it.  That's cool.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It works.  It works.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  So I guess what happens next -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- after we're done discussing?  
L:  Oh, I think --
R:  Has it even been ten minutes?  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's been like five.  They tell us -- I think they're gonna tell us when it's -- when it's done [several inaudible words].
R:  They pretty -- okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So what else can we talk about?
L:  So as far as -- as far as --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] friends?  What's important to you, like, in a friend?  [inaudible].
R:  Okay.  Um --
L:  As far as character.
R:  -- let's see.  Trustworthy.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Honest.  Um, pretty much true.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So many people are so untrue out there.  It's so nice to just find somebody that's down to earth and, um, not all about money and things like that.  
L:  Right.
R:  Just -- just like somebody that's valid.  
L:  I find it --
R:  What about you?
L:  Yeah, I find I have to stick to the people.  I -- I guess loyalty is one of my big ones because it just seems like I've met too many people that -- that are not as, um, I don't know -- I don't think -- I don't know if the word is sincere or not.  Um, they don't have a lot of integrity in -- 
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I hate to say that but nowadays it's sort of like, you know, we -- we don't just live in one area.  You -- you know people here there and everywhere so it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sort of like [MN] there's not as much accountability unless you get really close to somebody.  I think that's the other part of the reason why I like to have close --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- friendships instead of so many acquaintances.  You know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You just don't have the loyalty and -- and whatever there, I don't think, if you -- if you don't.  
R:  That's true.
L:  And it's fine to have acquaintances but, I don't know, that only goes so far with me.  I guess I'm a more personal type person, you know.
R:  Right.  
L:  It's like --
R:  Yeah, I [MN] that passing [LAUGH] sliding moment.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I just -- there's so many different people that I run into now and -- and just being out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the field I'm in.  I'm in -- in mental health and, um, I -- I've never been in as big of an office as I'm in now.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  And you just come across so many just tatty people.  
L:  Right.  
R:  And women --
L:  Oh.
R:  Women, oh, it's -- they're the biggest abusers of it and it's just --
L:  I know.
R:  -- unbelievable to me.
L:  I agree.
R:  And men, I've always had closer, like, [MN] when I would be at work and what not.  I'd be closer with the men because at least you know where they were coming from.  
L:  They're -- 
R:  And you --
L:  They're direct.  They'll tell you.  You know, what --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- they think instead of going behind your back and saying something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is fine in front of you and then running to somebody else, a third party.  [LAUGH]  You know.
R:  Oh, God.  It's sickening.
L:  [COUGH]  Mhm.
R:  It's sickening.  A bunch of grown women and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're just --
L:  I know.
R:  -- [MN]  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know I have a sister in law will [MN], well both -- both -- well one of my sister in laws is a pretty good friend too.  She lives right here in this same area and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she says the same thing.  We have this -- we -- we had this discussion previously and she's worked with a lot of women in various offices, and so have I, and it just doesn't seem to matter where I'm working I -- I end up having a couple of re- -- very close friends in each of the offices but I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- seem to extend it just because of that.  I can't stand that, um, that backstabbing attitude.
R:  [inaudible].  
L:  [LAUGH]  You know.  So ...
R:  Oh, gosh.  It's awful.  
L:  It is.
R:  It's awful.
L:  [COUGH]  It is.
R:  And it happens everyday.  Like, um, today, just -- just a for instance we were sitting, um -- I was sitting at the front desk and, um, one of the girls from the office comes up and she's like, "Oh, well, so and so's sleeping in her office".  You know, and I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- so right --
L:  So mind your own business.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well I just looked at her and I just, it's like, yeah, and ...?  "And you're telling --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- me this because I should do ...?"  Well, her whole thought was there was a new girl standing in back of me.  Well let's her -- get her on the bandwagon and send her to the boss to rat the other girl out.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So that's --
L:  And they wonder --
R:  -- exactly what she did.
L:  And they wonder -- women wonder why friendships don't really thrive in the office.  I mean, you know, it [LAUGH] just -- it's like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- okay, uh, get me out of here.  You know.  A lot of times I don't even participate, this is probably going to sound terrible, but like company parties and what not.  It's really kinda hard because, you know, yeah, I've got a couple of friends who are probably within the firm, or wherever I'm working at, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I really hesitate to go sometimes just because of all the cattiness, the extended type thing.  And you know what happens when you go to a company party?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Those few people who get drunk and there's a few people I -- just to me it's just like, "Okay, just gonna find a good excuse to stay away".  That probably sounds awful.  But I've done it before --
R:  Right.
L:  -- quite a bit.  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  Yeah.  Because you have to.  Because what --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- good is it going?
L:  Mm.  But --
R:  You know, it just -- 'cause what are they gonna
