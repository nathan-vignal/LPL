R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.  Hi.  
R:  My name is Bonnie.
L:  My name is Melissa.
R:  And, uh, we were supposed to discuss what -- where we pre- prefer to eat.  Whether we prefer to eat in a restaurant or prefer to eat at home.
L:  Right.  
R:  And, um, I'm a retired principal, and I like to do a lot of exercise and things like that, and I love eating dinner out.  
L:  Ha.
R:  But I also like preparing meals at home for company.  Which is [inaudible] --
L:  But not for yourself?
R:  Um, I prepare most for myself, but I'm on Weight Watchers. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So I'm doing -- winning points on Weight Watchers.  So it's much more fun to prepare food when you have company than it is for yourself.
L:  Definitely.  
R:  Are you a single person or are you married?
L:  Oh, I'm single.  But I -- I -- I mean, I have a boyfriend and I cook sometimes for him, but we usually go out and eat a lot of fast food which isn't good for me but ...
R:  Don't you -- sometimes you  -- it's more economical to go out --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- than it is to eat in the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I know, I don't know about you.  But one -- one single person, I throw an awful lot of things away.  You know, if you buy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you bought a half gallon of milk and you have milk left over.  If you ever bought fruit and vegetables, you don't use 'em right away, then that -- that's left over.  So a lot of times I prefer eating out with friends --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- than going to various restaurants.  
L:  'Cause there's no -- y- you can't -- you don't even feel right going and making an entire meal for yourself when --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if it's just you gonna enjoy it.  Then I just feel like I might as well eat in some [inaudible] or even healthier.
R:  Do -- do you -- have you used the entertainment book?
L:  No.  I don't even know what it is.
R:  Are you familiar with that?  The entertainment book is you get it [MN] each [MN] I li- -- I live in Pittsburgh.  Where do you live?  
L:  Uh, in Chicago.  
R:  In Chicago.  Every city has an entertainment book.  And therefore you get two for the price of one when you go into a restaurant.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  
R:  Check it out.  It's called the Entertainment Book of Chicago.  I'm su- I -- I know they have it.  I've --I've seen the --
L:  Interesting.
R:  -- in there.  And they have a lot of fast food two for ones in there.  They ha- have a lot of really fine restaurants two for one in --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- there.  And, um, it's +more -- more economical to go out to dinner at a restaurant and --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- bring home[?] even half the portions you eat in a restaurant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than it is for you to make a complete meal at home.
L:  Definitely.
R:  By the time you get the vegetables and the meat and the chicken and the salad and all the things like that, it's much, much more, uh, expensive to eat at home.
L:  I still don't like spending -- spending the time to -- to clean up after myself.  And prepare everything.  Unless it's, you know, like you said for a -- for a group or for an event or for your friends.  But ...
R:  What are your favorite kind of restaurants to go to?
L:  Um ...
R:  Besides fast food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I like Italian food a lot.  Um, there's some good Italian restaurants in -- oh, Chicago has some different good restaurants.  Um, there are good Mexican restaurants too.
R:  Um, so you're an ethnic [inaudible] eater.  I -- I am more or less the same.  I love Chinese food.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love Chinese food too.
R:  And I've got into Thai food recently.  
L:  Mm.  Definitely.
R:  And -- and the [MN] the Thai food's nice because the portions are smaller in Thai food than they are in Chinese --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- restaurants.  
L:  And it's lighter too.  I mean, just in terms of less oil and sort of tastes --
R:  Less heavy sauces --
L:  -- more fresh.
R:  -- and things like that.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  The It- the Italian, um, do you ever go to Bravo?  Do you have a Bravo there?
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  There's a Bravo.  I- it's a little -- it -- it's an Italian chain.  And they have a great spaghetti bolognaise and a salad that goes with that.  And there's a place called [several inaudible words] down town and they -- they give portions, like for three or four.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you -- you go there you have enough food --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to carry you for like three or four days at home.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  No, I do.  And I -- I do eat leftovers sometimes when I -- when I get them.
R:  Are you a college student?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, th- that's a difference too.  Then y- you're more into the economy.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  
R:  I'm retired and we're able to -- to go out and have a glass of wine for dinner and when you open a bottle of wine you -- for yourself, it kind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It kind of turns to vinegar real fast.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Whereas [LAUGH] if you -- you know, if you go out for dinner and there's like two or three people, or four people, for dinner then you kill a bottle of wine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- right away.
L:  Right.  And then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I, yeah, and I also -- spending money when I don't make [LAUGH] money isn't -- is not -- not a good thing to do.
R:  Do you kind of watch nutrition when you go out to eat?
L:  Yeah, I try to.  Because I -- I eat a lot of junk and then I end up [LAUGH] gaining weight 'cause from it.  So, I mean, I -- I -- I try -- I try and like we, I don't know, we eat at Subway sometimes and I know that they ...
R:  Subway's fabulous because, like, at Weight Watchers Subway's only six points.
L:  Really?
R:  And you -- you can get the grilled chicken teriyaki, which I love.  And -- and th- this, um, [LIPSMACK] in the entertainment book you -- you can get Subways, like, for two for -- two for one.  
L:  Really?
R:  And those three ninety nine Subways you can get two for one, and there's all these coupons --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- in our paper to get Subway.  So a lot of us do go to Subways and you can even get salad, you know, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- buy a salad and bring it home.  Get the one, six inch heavy.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then bring that in.  And they have so many different kinds of Subways today.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That I think the people really, you know, go to Subway probably a lot more frequently than they had in the past.
L:  Definitely.  And it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's always -- you always know what you're getting.  And it's always relatively healthy.  And ...  You know.
R:  It's fresh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's portion control.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you know th- th- the six inch bun is six -- a six inch bun with a chicken teriyaki's like six points on Weight Watchers, which is like two hundred and forty calories.  
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And if you --
L:  That's not much
R:  -- if you have a computer.  Go to +Subway -- Subway dot com.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And they'll tell you all the calories and the fat content --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- in everything you have for Subway.
L:  But then sometimes I like to not [LAUGH] think about it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  To not know that?  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, because then the more I think about it the -- the more annoying it [MN] I don't know.  It makes me -- it makes me more neurotic about everything that I put into myself.
R:  Do you go watch what -- do you eat like fried foods?  You know [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, I do eat fried foods.  I -- I try not to not eat things that I really like 'cause I -- I don't want to really compromise my entire, um --
R:  Lifestyle?
L:  Because I -- I like a food a lot and -- and I enjoy it.  You know.  And 'specially when I've [MN] been busy with schoolwork and everything.  It's just -- it's like one of the few things that there is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to do for entertainment.
R:  Do you exercise a lot?
L:  Um, a fair bit.  Not -- not when I'm really busy.  But I do a lot of yoga which is sort of ...
R:  I just started doing that too, yeah, yoga.  But [MN] ...
L:  It's not very [MN] calorie burning but it's ...
R:  It's stress re- reduc- reducing.
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  I do water aerobics and I do weights and, uh, things like that.  But when I go out to a restaurant I feel like I have to exercise more -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- than I do otherwise.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I was even looking at Dr. Atkins diet as far as the diet's concerned.  And that's easy when you go to a restaurant because you just get steak and salad and, um, you can get everything as long as it has no carbs in it.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So in a restaurant you can probably control the carbs equally as well as you can control the carbs, um, at home.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  What kind of restaurants do they have in Chicago?  You started saying that they have different kinds of ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, there's -- there's good Chinese food.  Um, there's like a large Mexican population, so there's a lot of Mexican food.  And, um, just in the neighborhood that I live in, um, there are a lot of, sort of, smaller -- smaller restaurants that are -- that are pretty good.  Um ...
R:  Ma and Pop restaurants, like?
L:  Yeah, kind of.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean --
R:  Do a lot of the restaurants know you?  Like, by name?
L:  No, they --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- don't.  I don't know why but, um, they -- they're -- you know, it's 'cause there's a lot of college students around here so, like, I think they --
R:  Oh, you're not from Chicago?
L:  -- see ...  No, I'm originally from Boston.  And actually the food is a lot better [LAUGH] there.  
R:  Oh, the food's wonderful in Boston.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  The -- the Italian section of Boston, the food's ex- excellent.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We drive to the Cape and it's as excellent there too.  So, I mean, they -- they're different kinds of restaurants.  [MN]  You -- you know, there's like a fast food restaurant.  And there's like -- there's like family owned restaurants.
L:  Right.
R:  And there's like restaurants that you can call them and they deliver to your house.  Like a l- a lot of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- places here in Pittsburgh, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I lived here so long.  They know me as far as, um, what we want.  When we call and say here you are.  You say oh, want this [inaudible] restaurant.  So a restaurant can be take out.  
L:  Huh.
R:  A restaurant can be, yeah, going into the restaurant.
L:  Yeah.  And they're kind of totally different things.  It's funny to even call them all restaurants when some of them are just, you know, something you do on the run and you grab it and you go, and then some of it is, uh ...
R:  Some of it just like drive through restaurants.  I feel like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like a Wendy's or McDonalds or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a place like that so they're -- that -- that's one kind of restaurant.  But --
L:  Do you eat -- do you ever eat fast food or do you try and avoid it?
R:  I -- 
L:  Other than Subway?
R:  I eat -- I eat very little fast food.  I used to big of it.  Be a big Wendy, the double bacon cheeseburger.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  French fries and things like that.  But I haven't had that for over -- I've lost almost sixty pounds in Weight Watchers.
L:  Oh, my gosh. 
R:  And I've done that --
L:  Wow, congratulations.  
R:  I've done that eating out.  Um, I was really good in the beginning and I'd, like, go to a restaurant, I'd get like fish broiled with orange juice or lemon -- lemon and a baked potato.  I'd take [inaudible] butter spread with me and spread it on the -- on the baked potato there at the restaurant.  Or else ask for half the portions you got at home.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And if you got like -- like pasta you're li- like, um, one cup of pasta, two cups of pasta, you know, usually you're eating like six cups of pasta so you take part of that pasta home.  The --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- restaurants really are pretty nice about, um, you're watching your weight and portion control.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you tell 'em what you want.  Sometimes it's easier in a restaurant than it is to actually be home when you're on a diet.  
L:  Huh.
R:  So, um ...
L:  You've liked -- you've liked the program?  The Weight Watchers, though?
R:  Um, it's slower than I wanted to be but it's not part of my thoughts[?].  You know, I -- I eat out an awful lot of restaurants.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if my friends are having a steak either at Moretons or from Ruth Chris's[?] then I want the steak from Moretons or Ruth Chris's.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that one day or so I'm off.  And then, um, we ate Damons last week.  Which is -- which is, um, a rib restaurant.  Did you ever hear of Damons?
L:  Uh-uh.  No.
R:  That's a rib restaurant.  So we had, um, ribs and we had the, um, onion loafs which isn't the best thing for your diet.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I watched the rest of the week.  Then I went to -- do have Friars[?] in Chicago?
L:  Uh, yeah.  
R:  [MN]  Like I said Friars.  The -- the -- the salad with a cajun chicken on it that's fried.  So instead of having the grilled chicken, like I usually do, everyone was having for the fried chicken on the tables.  I wanted a fried chicken [several inaudible words] fried chicken on the table.  So, you know, in a way, when you're at a restaurant you see what other people eat.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  You taste a little bit of this and taste a little bit of that.  A little bit of this.  A little bit of that.  And that's bad, in a way.
L:  Huh.  But --
R:  But --
L:  But it -- is it flexible enough?  Is the program flexible enough to ...?
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's flexible enough that you can do what you want to do and, like, you can borrow points from one day to the next day.
L:  Huh.
R:  And you can exercise some extra points off and things like that.  But, um, I think restaurants give you nice ambience too.  And when you go into a restaurant --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you want to see exactly, um, the atmosphere and what people are wearing.  Here's your chance to get dressed up in a lot of restaurants.
L:  Definitely.
R:  And things like that.  So, um ...
L:  Especially when they're
