L:  Hi, my name is Anne and I'm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
R:  My name is Hugh Benedict.  I'm in Cincinnati, Ohio.  And, um, this is my first time on this, ah, this type of thing, I don't know if you have any experience with it.
L:  Oh, a- has the recording started already?
R:  I have not idea.  But I think so ...
L:  Okay, well I guess -- I guess so, if -- if we're talking -- both talking at the same time.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] no, it's not my first time, so we just, you know, we just talk like regular people, I guess. 
R:  Yeah, okay. [inaudible]
L:  So, ah, are you the o- -- the kind of person that has a lot of friends?
R:  No, I really don't.  I have maybe one or two, actually. 
L:  Okay.  And --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- like, are they really, really close friends?
R:  Well, w- we do things together, but I, you know, I don't know how to define that.  I mean, I feel I can talk to them when I've got problems --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, it -- you know, I've -- I've lived different places.  I've lived in, um, Cincinnati for about ten years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I've had different people who I felt I was really good friends with at different times.  I was dating somebody for a while and I was really good friends with her.  That was for about two years, and, um, there's this guy who I'm pretty good friends with now, ah --
L:  Did you grow up in, ah, in Cincinnati?
R:  I grew up in, ah, New Jersey. 
L:  So, did you keep, um, friends back where -- back in New Jersey?
R:  You know what, I had some friends back there.  I don't really -- there's only maybe one person who I'm really in touch with and he was somebody who I went to college with.
L:  Okay. 
R:  And we get together a couple of times per year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ho- how 'bout you?
L:  Well, um, I just moved to Milwaukee last July [LIPSMACK] and I grew up in Quebec, um, Montreal, Quebec --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in Canada.  And, um, I -- I -- I -- well, even in Canada, I -- I -- I honestly don't have that many friends, you know.  I have, like, two very good friends that I -- that I really, [SIGH] um, we don't hang out together that much, but we know that we're always there for each other, you know, even if it's like three in the morning, I know that I can c- call either of them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they'll be there.  Um, but I do have -- I do have a lot of people that I consider acquaintances.  Now, um, I -- I see a very big difference between a friend and an acquaintance and it's really hard -- it's hard for me to consider someone a friend.  It takes a lot of time and a lot of, um, trust.  So I would say that I -- I do have a lot of acquaintances, but I -- I wouldn't call them friends.  Um, you know, basically people I hang out with, people I will talk to on a regular basis, but, you know, not -- nothing very personal or, I don't know, you know. 
R:  Right, I'm pretty much the same way.  So, with your friends, do you feel that, I mean, do you -- do you feel that you pretty much will -- want to talk to them about things that are really personal, or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, um, they're -- they're pe- people I -- I grew up with and, [LIPSMACK] well, these two -- I mean, these two in --
R:  When you were in -- in Quebec did you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were you -- are you a French speaker?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So it's -- so basically do you still like to talk to them to practise speaking French?  Probably --
L:  Oh, well, yeah, I guess so.  We grew up, um, being friends in French, so it's hard, I mean, it's hard to change the relationship once you've established the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a language.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Sure, but --
L:  You know, it's --
R:  -- you probably don't get too many opportunities to speak French in Milwaukee, do you?
L:  No.  No, but I do have an e- -- ah, ah, a friend slash acquaintance [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, that I met here and he speaks French and we basically go back and forth.  Um, and we hang out together, um, mainly to s- -- to practise French, um, be- -- you know, we do have other things in common, but yeah, I guess so.  I guess that the language might have, um, might have a role to play in -- in my -- in the way I choose my friends. 
R:  So, you --
L:  But not for Quebec though.  Because, you know, we all grew up together speaking French and I don't think that it's -- I don't think that I talk to them or I call them in order to -- to practise my French.  I call them, you know, to talk to them, because they're my friends. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  Um, [LIPSMACK] ah --
R:  So, you might be like me too in that.  I mean, we were both brought up in areas which we don't live in, so really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, if I was going to, ah, visit family, I mean, I'd have to go quite a ways.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  But if you're going back to New Jersey to -- New Jersey, right? 
R:  Yeah, though my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- parents don't live there any more.  They moved to Maine. 
L:  Oh, okay, well, okay, yeah -- yes.
R:  But, yeah, but it's the same thing.  I mean --
L:  If you go back to the East coast, y- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you'll take an op- op- opportunity I -- um, I imagine to meet your friends at the same time? 
R:  Yeah, ah, usually I do.  I go back to the east coast once or twice per year, either to do work on a house I own there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to participate in a multiple sclerosis charity bike ride. 
L:  Okay.
R:  When I go back I get together with at least one friend, maybe two. 
L:  And what do you do usually with your friends?
R:  Um --
L:  I mean, besides talking and --
R:  That's it.  You know, well --
L:  Really?
R:  -- one of them goes on the bike ride with me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, he's a much faster rider than me so we don't normally stay together a- as long as maybe we sh- -- we -- we could.  So, but pretty much that's -- that's pretty much what we do. 
L:  Are they peo- -- you -- you -- ah, you said they're people you went to college with?
R:  Well, this is somebody who I used to work with.
L:  Okay.
R:  And the other one is somebody who I went to college with --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we get together, we go to my aunt's house, we make maple syrup or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- we do something up there.  Um --
L:  That's cool. 
R:  Yeah, my aunt lives about a hundred miles north of New York City. 
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, you know, it's -- it's -- it's pretty -- it's not north like Quebec, but, yeah --
L:  Well, it --
R:  -- it's a lot further than --
L:  -- is a ways.  It's -- you know it's not, like -- [SIGH] it's not two hours away. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So it's not like you could just call them up and say, "Hey, let's have coffee". 
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, that's something that I used to do with my friends when -- when we were a lot closer, um, and that I don't really do any more, you know, and that's why I make a difference between friends and acquaintances, because a friend is, like, someone that I could call out of the blue and say, "Hey, let's, you know, let's have coffee in half an hour", you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  "Let's meet in a ha- -- in a half hour" and I don't really feel like I can do that with acquaintances here. 
R:  Yeah, it's tough because things are so transient.  And I have some pretty good friends who -- well, I met some of them playing ultimate -- ultimate frisbee and some I met through bicycling and, you know, they've all moved.  You know, one lives in Norway, she got married and lives in Norway now.
L:  Wow.
R:  And one -- two of them got married -- I introduced two of them together and they got married and now they live in Texas now.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, but it's such a transient society, with people just --
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  -- just take off.  It's really difficult to keep --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, geographic, ah, closeness with people who you like to spend times with.
L:  But do you -- do you still consider them friends?
R:  Yeah, I did.  Actually the one -- I was really surprised, I tried contacting them a couple of times and they just didn't, you know, I sent them cookies [LAUGH] -- they -- I didn't -- they haven't returned my calls and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so I don't know what's going on, but, ah --
L:  See, that's too bad.  Because I -- I think that, you know, someone who would be a close friend, even if you haven't talked to each other in ten years, you would just, you know, take back where you left it. 
R:  Yeah, last I saw them was two years ago.  I helped them y- -- mo- -- pack up their stuff to move.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was kinda surprised, but, ah, I don't know.  I don't --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- really know how to deal with that.
L:  Yeah, well it's -- it's -- I guess it's hard, as you said, when, um, when people move away because -- especially I guess in the United States, people go off to college and you might meet someone in college and -- and you never see them again.  You know, it's -- it's almost like a temporary friendship. 
R:  Yeah --
L:  As --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- opposed to, I guess, I -- as opposed to Quebec, that's, you know, a more, um -- [SIGH] people don't move away that much, so I guess that -- I guess we -- we keep our friends from high school and college a lot longer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We grew -- you know, we grew up toge- -- we grew up together and went -- and then we're friends as adults together because people don't move away that much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  S- so [PAUSE] I'm trying to think of people who I would consider friends.  I've got -- yeah, there's probably, you know, at least four or five people I'd say I'm really pretty good friends with, but I don't really know, you know, I -- I feel kinda strange about, there's one gal who I met, I was wo- -- we were both working on a job together and she lived in, um, Toronto --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Toronto, Canada, I know there's a Toronto --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Ohio too, but ...
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Well, Toronto's very derivative with their names. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay. 
R:  But, ah, or O- Ohio is very derivative w- with their names.  And --
