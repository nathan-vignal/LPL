R:  Hi, I'm Jay.
L:  Hi, I'm Alexandra.  How are you?
R:  Good, Alexandra, how are you?
L:  Doing well, thank you.
R:  Okay, so the topic is friends.
L:  Friends, yes. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have no friends. [LAUGH]
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay, now we -- now we just rest[?] for ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well --
R:  Well, how old are you, Alexandra?  You sound --
L:  I'm twenty seven.
R:  Um, how old?
L:  Twenty seven.
R:  Okay.  A little bit younger.  I -- you sounded very young, I -- I was just, uh, curious.  Um --
L:  How old are you?
R:  Forty.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  But, you know, you sounded -- you know, you sounded, you know, very young and I guess, as you get older, ah, perspectives and perceptions of friends change.  I mean, there are pe- -- I have friends that go back to when I was in high school and then there are also people that I was friends with -- with some of these people that I don't bother speaking to any more, because it became a one sided thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and, you know, you put the effort in and the effort's not returned, y- you -- you think to yourself, "Why bother?"
L:  True. 
R:  Okay.  So, okay, now, all right, that's two minutes' worth.  [LAUGH] Um ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH] Ah ...
L:  Well, so would you say you have many +acquaintances or do you have few good friends?
R:  I -- I --
L:  Or do you have a mix?
R:  I guess I would have to say, I have a few good really close friends and many acquaintances, but, you know, those who are very close to me I keep close and, you know, we may not speak every day or even every week sometimes, but they're still, you know, still close --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, ah, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I do.
R:  So, what about you? [NOISE]
L:  I actually have reevaluated a lot of my relationships recently.
R:  Mm.
L:  And ended up, um, sort of breaking off with some of the friends that I had.  Oh, excuse me -- twenty one -- um, [LIPSMACK] and that was very hard [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I realised that it did become very one sided --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I didn't get anything out of the friendship --
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- and I thought that why, you know, waste time and energy on people when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they don't bring anything to my life?  So maybe it's a little selfish --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on my part, but [SIGH] I just felt, I don't know, I felt --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I was being kinda used. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, no, it's not.  You ta- -- it's not, ah, it's not, um, it's not selfish, 'cause I mean [MN] the one that always sticks out to me -- this is many years ago -- um, I had two friends that, you know, from high school, who ended up moving to Pennsylvania to go away to school, and I left school and I was living in -- I -- I grew up on Long Island, and I moved to New Jersey.  And I started a new job and they're like, "So, when are you coming down to visit us?  When are you coming down to visit us?  When are you coming down to visit us?"  And I'm like, "Well, look, you know, I just started a new job, so I don't even have vacation time or any free -- you know, any time, but listen, when you guys drive up for, you know, to visit your parents --" 'cause our, you know, our -- all three of our parents still lived in the town we grew up in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- so when you guys, you know, drive up --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- ah, to, um, [LIPSMACK] visit -- visit your folks, look, I'm in Jer- -- I'm on the Je- -- I'm on the Jersey side of the bridge now, and I'm not that far from the bridge, so why don't you guys stop by.  We can visit a little bit.  And, ah, you know, and then, ah, you know, you guys go on to the island and whatever".  And they're like, "Uh-huh, sure, okay".  
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Never heard from them.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, they never tried.  I moved again -- her -- her mother was the receptionist from my eye doctor, so it's not even like, um, they could, ah, you know, if they wanted to get in -- hold of me --
L:  Yeah.  They --
R:  -- they could.
L:  -- they could.  Yes.
R:  But -- and they didn't try.  My -- in fact a couple -- a couple of months ago, my sister actually ran into the wife -- they -- they -- -- they since got married -- ran into the wife, um, working -- wife was working at Walmart -- ran into her and talked to my sister, never asked about me.  Never asked, "Where's Jay?", you know. 
L:  Oh.
R:  And I'm like, "Uh-huh, I made the right choice".  'Cause, you know, the pe- -- they just very self centered and, ah --
L:  Well, you feel it, you feel it.  You feel it when a person is just not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not friend material any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No matter what good times you might have had, people change --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so and that's how I felt, and I felt a little bit bad about it, but then I realised that it -- it doesn't do me any good and I think that, I don't know, we spend so much time, you know, at work, [SIGH] relating with -- to people we don't like necessarily --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- if friends and people around us, close to us, should be the people that we like, I think. 
R:  Exact- -- I mean, look, you spend more time at work -- most people spend more time at work than they do with their own families --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and, you know, then you've gotta fit in time for friends, it gets to the point where, you know what, I've gotta decide who I want to spend my time with, and who, you know, when I've got free time, I've gotta spend -- you know, decide who I've gotta spend time with and who I don't.  I mean, [SIGH] I have a friend who had to have, um, knee surgery on Friday and it was at -- you know, she was in and out -- she was spending the weekend 'cause she -- she lives alone -- she was spending the weekend at her mom's house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who lives near me.  I -- so before she went into surgery, I said, "Look, I know you're gonna be -- I know 'cause I had knee surgery myself, I know you're going to be going nuts --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- um, yo- -- 'cause you're not going to be able to get -- even though you'll be able to probably get around by, you know, beginning of the week, and you're not going to be able to get around right away, do you want some company on Saturday?  You know, I'm free".  She's like, "Okay, yeah, we'll see".  I -- but I said, "Let's see how you feel".  I mean, she's a nurse, she knew what to expect.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was raining up here, the weather had a bad reaction with her, she called me on Saturday morning feeling really bad that she was not up to seeing me.  I'm like, "Look, I was going to cheer you up --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- don't worry about it, you know".  And that's a -- this is a close friend.  Do I speak to her every week?  No.  Do I see her?  I mean, the last time I saw her was probably about two months ago, but still we're re- -- we're really close and -- a- a- and, you know, that's the -- you know, that's the type of person if I'm going to take time from my free time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's who I wanna spend it with.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that's nice.  And you're there for each other and it doesn't have to an everyday type of thing anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, who has the time? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you know, every d- -- you know, there are some people that try, I mean, [MN] there are some people that try, you know, y- y- y- -- s- some form of contact, whether it's an email or a quick phone call or whatever every day, but, you know, you don't have the time necessarily, you're right.  And -- and, you know, you do what you can, when you can.
L:  I think that when you spend -- when you do that -- when you, I don't know, keep in touch every day you try to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- eventually it's -- what do you talk about? [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  It gets a bit boring.  I don't know, that's my perception.
R:  Well, you know, it's just a -- no -- that's [inaudible] -- it's just a quick, "Hey, what's happening, w- what are you doing today, what are you doing today?"  That type of thing.
L:  Mm.
R:  "Hey, you wanna get together, if you can, if you can't, whatever", but I know what you're saying, I understand what you're saying, you know.
L:  I guess maybe I'm also -- I've been married, I have a child, so maybe I'm not in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- I don't rally hang out and go out any more anyway, you know, so I'm sort of wrapped up in my own life --
R:  What --
L:  -- so for me if I do touch base it's sort of like you, once in a while --
R:  [MN] --
L:  -- [several inaudible words]
R:  You know what, I'm not married, I don't have a child [LAUGH] and I don't go -- I don't hang out that much any more either.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, there you go.
R:  So ...
L:  There you go. 
R:  But, um, [MN] yeah, I mean, yeah, it -- it really comes down to, you know what, I -- I mean everybody, you know, you go through, you know, younger schools and high school and everything else and you've got all these friends --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- but, y- y- -- I went -- I went to my, um ... two years ago I went to my twenty year high school reunion and I -- I saw some people there that were my best friends in the world, we -- and we hadn't seen each other probably since the ten year reunion.  And it's like, al- -- you know, and you catch up, but have I spoken to anybody from my reunion since, ah, since the reunion, that was two years ago?  No. 
L:  No?  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, y- y- you'll see them, it'll be, "Oh, hey, nice seeing you, bla, bla, bla", but, you know, t- that's that.  I mean, these aren't -- I mean, they were good friends but they weren't that -- that -- that close.  I mean, you know, at one point, ah, about ten years ago I was engaged and I was thinking to myself, okay, who's going to be at the wedding party?  Now if I were to get married, I would say about half the people who were on the list then aren't on the list now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, just things change.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  So ...  Boy, this is a better topic than the last one I got. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] What was the last one?
R:  Ah, business eth- -- business eth- ethics.  It was the day that Martha Stewart got indicted --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then -- then they call me the next night for the same survey and I'm like --
L:  No. [LAUGH] 
R:  "Come on --"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- give me another topic". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, you don't have to --
R:  Oh, I know.  I know, that's why I turned that second one down.  But it was like, you know, "Come +on".
L:  How many times do they call?
R:  I think it's -- I think it's minimum three.
L:  Oh, so they can call more than that?
R:  They could, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Hey, ten doll- -- at ten dollars a pop who cares?
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I was just wondering because I'm sort of not sure whether to expect more, 'cause this is my third one, and I don't know whether to expect more or not.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I guess I could, huh?
R:  Mm, could be.
L:  Huh, interesting.
R:  It's possible.  But, you know, a friend of mine -- a friend of mine emailed and, you know, we do -- we've done things, you know -- she found this of all places in the New York Village Voice and she thought it was like a -- [SIGH] I don't know, it was a, ah, um, [inaudible] you know, the Village Voice is always a se- -- could be a sex line or something, and it's, like, no, it's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's legitimate.
L:  I -- my friend actually let me know --
