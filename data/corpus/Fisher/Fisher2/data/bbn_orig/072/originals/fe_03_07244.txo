R:  Hi, I'm Josh.
L:  [MN] Hi, I'm Vicki.
R:  Hi, Vicki.
L:  Hi, Josh.
R:  Um --
L:  Do -- [LAUGH] go ahead.
R:  All right.  I guess, ah, I've worked at several restaurants, so I guess my favorite [NOISE] restaurant type would have to be, you know, a little bit ritzier, a little bit ones that kind of like their menus change every day, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You know, they have different varieties of food and it's always a little bit gourmet.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh, how 'bout yourself?
L:  Um, gee, I suppose that, ah, it depends on the restaurant.  I would probably prefer something like that, but depending on the occasion I might want to eat at home too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a question for you though, since you've been, ah, working in restaurants.
R:  Yes.
L:  What about, ah, [LIPSMACK] ah, hm, complaining or rude customers and things that happen to their food [LAUGH] in the back?
R:  [LAUGH] Well, for wherever I've worked I've never -- I -- have I personally ever had any issues really with, um, people putting items in food, if that's what you're going with?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or if it's just -- I've had, you know, complaints [NOISE] come back, you know, if people have cooked it wrong or whatever, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --never really had issues with people, like, finding hair in their food or any sort of disgusting items like that.  I really -- I think that's a terrible thing to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And no matter how angry you are at a customer, that's just disgusting. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, worse is putting in something that they couldn't spot. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?  Like, I don't need to get graphic do I? [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, no.
L:  So, yeah.  So wh- -- I -- what was the other question?  What type of food do you prefer?  Is that -- was that the first part?
R:  I -- I guess. [MN]
L:  Something like that.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, gee, alright.  Well, so you said you liked the menu change every day.  What, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what would be your perfect meal?  I think that was part of the question too.
R:  Oh, perfect meal.  Jeez that's hard to say.  'Cause I really like my mom's homemade [LAUGH] cooking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, let's see.  I'd have to say the best meal I've ever had was like a chicken cordon bleu, sort of deal.
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  Ah, had it here in my home town.  It's a --
L:  And where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where are you?
R:  Where am I?  I'm, um, in State College, Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] It's, ah -- it's a place called The Tavern.  They have a gourmet chef that works there and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything like that. [COUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  And really my -- my favorite kind of food's right there.
L:  Yeah.  And is that, ah -- it's one of the ritzier, ah, restaurants?
R:  Ah, kind of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There -- there are ritzier around but, you know, it's just, you know, [NOISE] decent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- upper class kind.  They have more than one [NOISE] fork, you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And they're not plastic? [LAUGH]
R:  No, no.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Well, sometimes the, ah, you know, even the ritzier restaurants don't always have the best chefs, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I can agree with that.
L:  So, yeah. 
R:  As long as you -- if you have a good chef, I think it's what's going to happen.  Like, um -- like you have some restaurants that give you way under portioned amounts of food that are really ritzy.  It's like fifty dollars a plate and they give you like five grams of food.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  Yeah, it's [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's kind of like the, um, [LIPSMACK] oh God, did you ever see the movie LA Story?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where they go to the restaurant, it's, ah, in French it's Leedeow[?] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and there's, ah, you know, a little, I don't know, a slice of pepper on the plate and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you -- you can hardly see the food.
R:  A little spray of sauce and ...
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's, ah -- that's the kind -- I think that's part of the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, what people think is upscale though, you know?
R:  [NOISE] I guess, I don't know.
L:  You pay a hundred bucks and go away hungry, so ...
R:  Pay a hundred bucks and then you drive like you're sheiks or something --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- give me an MTO.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's pretty sad, but unfortunately that, ah, that seems to be the way.  It's either that or some of these other places on the, ah, on the other end of the scale.  Like, I don't know if you have -- do you have Claim Jumper there?
R:  No, we don't.
L:  It's, ah -- it's kind of a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- oh, I don't know, I -- a family restaurant.  It's really loud and -- and Plate -- Plate of Nachos is not my favorite place but, ah, they -- they bring this plate that's probably twenty inches wide and it's heaping and it's ridiculous.  It's overkill, you know?  But --
R:  It's just --
L:  -- and then on top of it, it's not all that good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] who wants more if it's, [LAUGH] you know, if it's no good?
R:  Excessive amounts of bad food. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  But the price is right, you know? [LAUGH]  It's, ah, kind of crazy people, I don't know.  I think sometimes they just want lots, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  It doesn't matter what it tastes like as long as you can gulp it down and it fills you up for some people.
L:  Exactly.  It's like, well, you can probably get the same effect with a glass of water, but --
R:  Mhm. [MN]
L:  -- you know.  Well, that's -- that's probably not most people's idea [LAUGH] of a meal, you know?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So, yeah.
R:  Well, I'd have to say some of the best meals I've ever had though are like that.  Those mom and pop restaurants kind of deals.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where they're like family owned and, like, these old Italian families who make, like, these huge plates of really good pasta or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's just [NOISE] delicious food.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] But it -- I mean, it's not [NOISE] expensive but it's really nice food.
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Well -- and it's, ah, d- do you have any Italian, ah, heritage in you?
R:  No, not really. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, well, I do --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and I've, ah, yeah, I kind of got spoiled with the good Italian food growing up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then if I even dare to get Italian food in a restaurant it's, ah, you know, it -- it's really -- it -- it's almost insulting.  It's, you know -- you get spaghetti with water on the bottom of the plate and --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- and things like that.  And it's like, you know, no Italian worth her salt would dare do that, you know?
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  But that's, ah -- that's what you end up getting.  I guess whatever -- whatever you're used to at home --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when you grew up.  And if you, you know, try to -- try to [LAUGH] get that same thing in a restaurant, it's just not going to happen.
R:  Oh, my f- --
L:  You know?
R:  -- my family's very Irish, so I've had a lot of potatoes.
L:  [LAUGH] But even those you can mess up in a restaurant, right?
R:  Ah, oh yeah, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've -- I don't know how people mess up a baked potato, but --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  -- somehow they do it.
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.  [LAUGH] There's certain things that, ah, well, something like, even like breakfast of, like, scrambled eggs.  How do you mess that up?  But sometimes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] You crack 'em --
L:  -- you get 'em and they're --
R:  -- you break the yoke and you mix 'em.  I mean [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you just watch for them not to burn.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Exactly, but you know, sometimes you get this thing of rubber, a yellow rubber on your plate and, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you just wonder how -- how in the world, you know, this is, ah, some culinary expert in the kitchen there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah, can't even manage the scrambled eggs.  So that's [inaudible].
R:  Well, sometimes they don't have culinary experts, they just --
L:  That's right, [LAUGH] they don't.
R:  -- they just have some Joe Schmuck walk in off the street going --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "I think I can cook".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but isn't that about the first thing that people learn to cook when they're, you know.  You learn to boil water and scramble an egg, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Pretty much.
R:  Yeah.  How long does it cook to boil an egg -- how long does it take to boil an egg?  That's the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I still don't know that, but ...
L:  That -- well, you know what?  It depends, you want it soft boiled or hard boiled?
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then sometimes you think you're getting hard boiled but you didn't boil it long enough. [LAUGH]
R:  And you just mess everything up then.
L:  That's right. [LAUGH]  Yeah, you're not, ah, you're not going to make deviled eggs with, ah -- with the soft boiled, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um ... [LAUGH]
R:  Never been a fan of deviled eggs.
L:  You what?
R:  I've never been a fan of deviled eggs really.
L:  No?
R:  No.  Always liked mine just, you know, scrambled or over easy with breakfast.  Never really liked the whole hand [NOISE] held little, [MN] [NOISE] I don't know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- hors d'oeuvre looking thing.
L:  [LAUGH] Hand held.  That's called a boneless chicken dinner.
R:  Ah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  That's a hard boiled egg, boneless chicken dinner.  Pretty bad stuff, but ...  Yeah, you know, and they don't serve a lot of deviled eggs in most restaurants anyway.
R:  No.
L:  That's kind of a picnic thing, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I had that at my graduation picnic over the weekend. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Wh- what did you graduate from?
R:  I graduated from high school.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and, ah, how's the food in high school? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, terrible. [LAUGH]
L:  Is it?  Do they [LAUGH] -- do they have the, ah, mystery meat Fridays and ...?
R:  Well, no they don't have that any more.  They've -- they've tried to, um, modernize some of the high school food, [NOISE] but it's still -- you're making mass production amounts of food.  It seems -- still seems like military surplus.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And I know that some of that grill was pretty disgusting, so 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Well, [LAUGH] there's, ah -- there's still time to make that connection between a decent lunch and how you perform in, ah, in your classes.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I guess they figure if they slap some milk at you, you're okay.
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  You know?  'Cause they've been doing that for -- for years.
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Trying to figure that one out.
R:  [MN] Well, you get a cup of milk and you barely know what to do with it, 'cause you drink it all in one gulp and you're just sitting there like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "What am I go- -- supposed to do with the rest of the food now?"
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, well, have you done this, ah, phone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thing before here?
R:  No, this is my first time. 
L:  Yeah.  Okay, well, it's -- ah, it's kind of cool.  It's, ah, you know, kind of i
