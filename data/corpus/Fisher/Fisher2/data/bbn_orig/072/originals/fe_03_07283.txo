R:  Hi, it's Catherine.
L:  Hi, this is Laurie.
R:  Hi, Laurie.  How are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm very good thanks.  
L:  Good.  [COUGH]  So our topic is food?
R:  Yep.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- a pretty good topic.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, yeah, it's good because I love food.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, I do too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Actually I prefer eating in a restaurant.  I mean, I like eating at home.  I'm a good cook and everything, well, I would think so.  But, um, it's kind of nice to be waited on by somebody else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  Not to have to do the dishes and all that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I totally agree.  Plus it's kind of an entertaining experience when you go out to eat.  It's not just the food, you know.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's, uh, more than that.  
R:  Yeah.  It's the atmosphere.  Like right now I just had a baby like five months, well she's five months on Thursday so it's like -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- any opportunity to get out --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- of the house is [LAUGH] great.  
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know what I mean.  Like I love my daughter and everything but it's like it's great to just go out for a meal and, you know, I love when I go out and someone else is like totally waiting on me and I don't have to think about how I have to do the dishes.  Or --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] or is tasting right, you know. 
L:  I know. 
R:  I can always complain if it doesn't taste right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  I know.  That is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nice.  You don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have to worry about any of that.  And plus --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] if you have to make dinner at night it's like you have to think about it all day long.  What am I gonna make?
R:  Uh, what am I gonna make?  You know.  
L:  [MN]
R:  What ingredients do I not have?  Like right --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I just got home a few minutes ago and it's like what am I gonna eat?  I don't even know.  Like, you know, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's -- it's very nice.  And my perfect meal, I guess, would be like being in a nice restaurant where the atmosphere's totally like, like, nice and cool, relaxed.  Like I don't know if you know a restaurant called Baton Rouge?
L:  Oh, no, I've never heard of it.  
R:  Oh, gosh.  I'm in Canada by the way and --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Yeah, I am.
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm in Toronto and --
L:  That's neat.  
R:  -- I -- I love Baton Rouge.  I love Red Lobster too because the atmosphere's just nice.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, I -- I find that the -- the service is pretty nice and I just, you know, I like it when I go in and ever- everywhere is nice and, you know, uh, people are chatting but it's not like a huge noisy, market kind of, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- noise.  It's a nice --
L:  Right.
R:  -- quiet kind of atmosphere and, you know, the waiters are always very, very nice and they refill all your drinks so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's very nice.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And you can just stay as long as you want and talk and ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  And --
R:  No one's rushing you, you know.  
L:  [NOISE]  Right
R:  And it's good food, you know.  I like having good food.  So ...
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  I do too.  Plus it's nice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if [COUGH] it's nice when you take your family out because everybody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- can get what they want and nobody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is complaining --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Oh, I don't want this".  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or, "I don't --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- like that" or ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you're not having to wash like too many pots from cooking too many different things at the end of the night.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Sometimes I'll cook a big meal, like on Sundays --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then we'll have leftovers but sometimes I think it's [NOISE] almost more work to heat up all the leftovers 'cause --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you got [LAUGH] all -- you know, six --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different containers.
R:  Yeah.  And then you gotta be creative.  Like --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- personally I don't like having too much, like, food leftovers in the fridge for too long.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, because then it's like how do you put it together in a way to make it still interesting and --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- still taste good?  You know.  But --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, it's still the same meatball from yesterday and --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- how do I make meatball interesting?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  You [LAUGH] know.  
L:  I know.  
R:  [MN]  There's only so much you can do with spaghetti, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You can't disguise it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, it's, uh, it's nice -- it's nice --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- to go out.  I guess it's just -- the main thing is just the expense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, you know, stops me from like really eating out as much.  And then sometimes it's like you don't really know what's in the food so maybe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not such a good idea to eat out too much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  I know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Plus it's so much more fattening and the portions are so big. 
R:  Oh, yeah and ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The portions are huge.  [MN]  You know.
R:  Yeah, they're like -- like -- what are they like, twice what they're supposed to be or something?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.
R:  And it's so hard -- they always say, "Oh, tell 'em to box it half of it up right away".  Yeah, that never --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  -- happens.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, I mean -- but the -- like I find that if I go eat Chinese food, like, if I have it nice and fresh right there it tastes good.  But immediately it's cold and you reheat it --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it doesn't taste the same.
R:  I know.  
L:  You know.  
R:  So it's like is it really worth it, you know, taking food home sometimes?
L:  Right.  
R:  You know.  I only take food home from the restaurant when I find that I'm -- like I'm filled already and I don't want to be eating the food without really enjoying it, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't want to be eating just for eating's sake.  I want to enjoy the taste and everything in my mouth, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but you're right.  It -- it is expensive.  So it makes it tempting to just eat at home and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Plus I always think, like, if I'm too tired or maybe I didn't take anything out for dinner I think, oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we should just go get fast food but by --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the time you go and get it and bring it back it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you could've spent that time making dinner anyway.
R:  Making dinner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Anything.
R:  And you only -- you only eat fast food.  You're eating your fo- your food I find at some restaurants I go in there, I eat, I'm filled.  Immediately I leave the place I go use the washroom.  Just pee or something, the food's gone.
L:  I know. 
R:  It's like, oh my God.  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  [MN]
R:  I just spent so and so and so amount and it's like, you know, where is it?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]  Really.
L:  It's just so expensive. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just -- it is pretty expensive.
L:  What would your perfect meal be?
R:  I think it would be in some -- in a restaurant which got candlelight.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, kind of like not too bright light.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Kind of dim.  Um, nice huge steak.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Some ni- -- you know, some- something -- something with lots of meat basically.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right. 
R:  I don't -- I don't like going to, um, what's it called? Um, what is it?  Like, uh, eat as much as you like kind of places?  [MN]
L:  Oh, a buffet.
R:  Yeah.  Buffet.  Like I like buffets once in a while but I don't really see that as a treat.  I see that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as being a -- like, I wouldn't like it but for [inaudible] kind of thing.  I think it's [several inaudible words].  
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I definitely go -- I want to go somewhere, well, you know, classy.  Somewhere where it's a little bit expensive.  Just so I feel like I'm being pampered.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I feel like, yeah, this is a one off thing.  So why not just go all the way out.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...
L:  We do that at Christmastime.  We -- our -- my husband and our kids --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we get dressed up and we go to a really expensive dinner and it [LAUGH] costs --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, a hundred bucks or whatever and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we do it once a year.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think --
R:  You love it.  I mean, you work -- you work hard all the year.  All, you know.  It's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- gosh, okay, you have responsibilities but, hey --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everyone likes to live.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  So, you know, and try and enjoy it a little bit.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  [MN]  Yeah --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you're right.  You do work hard all year and ...
R:  Yeah.  You know.  You definitely need to have a few pampering moments.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Especially --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- during the holidays.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I mean, yeah.  
L:  It's -- I --I guess it's --
R:  Christmastime.
L:  -- easier to spoil yourself in the hol- during the holidays.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  It is.  It is.  And it's so cold you may as well do something.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Do something fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  But then it is kind of nice if you have like your whole family over and you make a nice dinner and ...
R:  I'm gonna make a meal.  [MN]  Especially it's nicer when, like, everybody kind of pitches in to do something.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's not so nice when you are like the only one doing everything --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and you're being overwhelmed.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH]  You know. 
L:  I kno- I know.  A couple ye- -- well, we have a daughter who's almost two and a couple of years ago --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, when she was first born she was about, well, I guess she was about eight weeks old and I decided --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to have Thanksgiving dinner at my house.  Which was --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- crazy.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So -- and she cr- -- and so I'm like trying to fix Thanksgiving dinner all day long and she's crying and crying.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So I learned my lesson.
R:  Oh, boy.  Next time never try doing it alone.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
R:  You know.  I know moms always think they're superwomen but if they --
L:  I know.
R:  -- you know.  If you -- if someone offers you help just take it.
L:  Yeah, right.  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words]. 
L:  Plus they like to help.  It's not like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's putting them out.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  'Cause, see I'm like that too.  I try to do everything.  'Cause I figure that if I do it on my own it's gonna be faster.
L:  Right.  
R:  But not necessarily, you know, just let someone else help out and, you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- enjoy the experience better.  At least by the time I sit down to eat I won't be so tired from running and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- carrying this pan and that pan.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  And then you eat and it's over in fifteen minutes.
R:  And it's like, "Oh, gosh".  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like [LAUGH] a big [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I know.  And then you think about, oh, my God, I got to clean up all these --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dishes and everything.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, man.  I hate it when you have some -- every once in a while we'll have maybe ten or twelve people over and there's so many plates and stuff you can't even fit it all in the dishwasher.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, at least, you have a dishwasher.  I don't have that [inaudible].  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, you don't?
R:  I am my own dishwasher.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I wash everything, but what I do is I try and do everything the same day so it's not so overwhelming.
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's probably --
R:  Kind to keep it up.
L:  -- a really good idea.  
R:  Yeah.  Because if I do it the same day it's like then I can, like, relax afterwards instead of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like relaxing and then you get up and it's like, oh, my God.  Look at this place it's a mess.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.  Right.  
R:  Yeah.  Or if it's a family thing why not just get the men to do it.  You know.  The women cook.  The men wash up.  
L:  Yeah.  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Plus you probably are more conservative with your dishes.  Like because we have a dishwasher I know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- my son will just -- everytime he gets a drink in the evening he'll use a new glass.  And I'm always yelling at --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- him, "Rinse out --" 
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- your old glass".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.  But he'll use --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- four glasses in one --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- evening.  
R:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, but I know if I was doing it myself, my gosh.  
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely if you were doing them yourself you wouldn't be doing that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  I'd put a stop to that really fast.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah.  So how you finding this, um, this phone things?  
L:  Um, I --
R:  Like how many have you done?
L:  Uh, this is just my second one.  
R:  Okay.  This is my second too.  But I don't -- I'm not sure if my first one really counted 'cause I think I registered twice by mistake.  I hope it counted.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Well, that would be good.  If it counted.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  And can -- are we
