R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Um, I'm Suzanne.
R:  I'm Leah.  How are you, Suzanne?
L:  Um, fine thanks.  Um, where are you located?
R:  I'm calling from Seattle, Washington.  How 'bout you?
L:  From San Francisco.  California.  
R:  Oh, okay.  I've been to San Francisco recently.  It's very nice.
L:  Oh.  Mm.  I've been to Seattle a while ago [LAUGH] but it's pretty nice there too.
R:  Why, thanks.
L:  Um ...
R:  You want to go ahead and start?
L:  Okay.  Um, for friendships I prefer to have like a small group of close friends.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, my best friend [MN] -- well, my best friend I've known her since, um, let's see, since I was in second grade.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that just happened because, you know, luckily it happened that way but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I met her since I was sec- in second grade and we've been really good friends and we've always kept in touch.  And then, um, why I -- I think having just a few good friends is more substantial to me than to have just -- have like a bunch of so so acquaintance friends.  Like --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- I'd rather have like deeper relationships with a few people and know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I can really count on them than to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to say, oh, it's -- it's more like quality over quantity.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I don't know.  That's ...  Yeah.  What about you?
R:  Oh, it's kinda complicated.  Um, let's see.  I guess as I have grown, um, and changed I found that, um, the people that I used to be friends with haven't always necessarily grown and changed with me or accepted the way that I've changed. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, just like I'm more of an outdoorsy person now and so they always want to be -- always wanted to be inside, you know, either watching movies or going out to eat and I'm like "Well, no, it's a beautiful day.  Let's go outside".  So eventually just doing[?] as many activities together.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, I lost them unfortunately.
L:  Right.  How old are you?
R:  I'm, uh, twenty nine.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm twenty five.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  I'm twenty five.
R:  Twenty five?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah?  And, I mean, you know, a lot of them I still keep in touch with but we're just not as close anymore.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, you know, since I'm in other activities I've -- I've got other friends but then there's one friend of mine that I knew since I was eighteen and we'd actually lost touch but, uh, we lived in, uh, nearby home towns and then I moved to Seattle and she moved to Seattle separately.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, now she's, uh, she's sharing the house that I live in.  Which is really nice 'cause I get to see her all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she likes to do a lot of the same activities as I do so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's -- it's really great that we have, you know, a lot in common and we do a lot of stuff together.
L:  Mhm.  I -- I think you brought up a good point of like pe- -- uh, like friends are -- they are able to grow with you.  Because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- actually when I think about it, my best -- I think the reason I'm still best friends with her and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we just still keep in touch.  I mean, she's in L.A. and that's kind of like, I mean, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah, that's a bit of distance.
L:  We went to the same, um, junior high and we went to different high schools and different colleges but, you know, we see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- each other once in a while.  We talk on the phone still.  But the reason we were still able to maintain it and -- it just seems like we -- it's very coincidental.  Like, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like in college I was taking a certain type of class.  Like a certain type of dance class and then -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then she -- she has an interest in it too so she takes it.  Or, um, like m- -- like our boyfriends are like -- you know, I'm dating someone that was younger and then later on she was dating someone that was younger and they were just like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- whoa, no way.  And it is very strange but we found --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like there was some sort of, like, kinship, in a sense.  Like we just got along and everything was a- about the same.  Like, ha- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- happening, like, you know.  Even like it -- it was very strange like when -- when, uh, sometimes I'll be like, oh, yeah, I'm taking this jewelry class and then she'll be like, oh, she's taking something else somewhere so we have -- we similari- um, and related interests.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that definitely helps.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So ... But then, uh, so I guess I have sort of different circles, you could say.  Because, you know, then I have sort of a -- a wider group of friends.  You know, I'm in a sports team and we're kind of -- we do a lot of stuff together and then I have an even wider group of, say, kind of party acquaintances.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, it's not like, you know, you can really call on [MN] on the large kind of group of friends for any real favorites.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, sometimes you can and you know I'm on a mailing list that's got a lot of people on it and, you know, every so often you can just sort of, you know, yell out, hey, you know, I'm looking for such and such or I'm trying to give away such and such.  Would anybody like it?  [MN]
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's nice to have kind of a lot of connections to people.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And know what's going on in a variety of, I don't know, worlds or what -- what have you.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess I just like to keep informed.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's definitely good.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  And I al- -- we- well, I also go to a church so, um, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- okay, since my friend -- my best friend's in L.A., she's still my best friend, but the people I hang around most with are like my church friends.  They're like around my age, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- twenty -- all twenties and we go, like, do outdoor activities together and actually this past weekend we went to Yosemite and, um, they have all very different personalities.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't know if I could see them being like my best friends but they're good to hang out as like in a group.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean it sounds --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like one -- you know, one or two could be like, uh, good friend material in the sense that we have stuff in common.  We could -- or it doesn't have to be like we do the same things but, you know, when you talk you can relate to the other person and they understand --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- what you're talking about. Like on the same level type of thing so that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- definitely helps.  Um ...  Yeah, so this -- for like this general social and outdoor activities it's through my church but, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with other things --
R:  It's always nice to have -- have a -- a -- a larger group of people you can do things with I think.  Like a church.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Um, let's see.  Yeah.  That's, um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you have [LAUGH] anything else to add?
R:  Um, I don't know.  That was probably, what, five minutes?  
L:  Okay.
R:  Sometimes this is surprisingly long -- long amount of time, isn't it?
L:  What?
R:  The ten minutes is surprisingly long?
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  It -- it is.  It -- it does seem that [LAUGH] way.  Um --
R:  [MN]  Have you done any of these before?
L:  Yeah, this is actually my third one.  
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Um -- oh, really?  Have you gotten paid for any of these?
R:  I have actually.  I haven't cashed the check yet but ...
L:  Well, how do you --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- know.  'Cause I'm supposed to get paid too but I haven't got any checks.
R:  Huh.  I can't remember --
L:  You've gotten --
R:  -- what the envelope -- huh?
L:  You've gotten your checks already?  Like ...
R:  Yeah, I've got one.  Yeah.  It took, I don't know, maybe a month or something.  I kept missing --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a lot of phone calls.  
L:  Oh.
R:  So this -- that's why it's only my third I think.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  'Cause I did like -- I actually did two in the same day, like, within an hour and a half of -- from each other.  It was kind of strange.  
L:  Oh.  Oh, maybe I should look into this.  'Cause I haven't got -- I haven't -- I've done two already, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- two within --
R:  Recently or ...?
L:  Um, yeah, like probably last month.  No, no.  Maybe -- yeah, in -- I think, yeah, in May.  May something.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I haven't gotten anything yet.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't remember what the envelope looked like or anything.  If it was like, you know, an envelope that looked like junk mail or something.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But, uh, yeah, I don't know.  You might want to contact them just to see, I guess.
L:  Yeah, I think I'll do that.  Mm.  Oh, I think travelling --
R:  So ...
L:  -- like distance wise, if you go far away, it's better to do it with like a close friend.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Than just like a regular friend.  I mean, regular friends maybe but just not like really acquaintances.  Well, um, actually --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wait I take that back.  It depends on the personality because some people are just like, oh, whatever, you know.  Whoever I travel with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's cool.  But some people it's like if you're gonna travel it -- you're in, I don't know.  It's -- fights do seem to come up sometimes when you travel because -- like deciding who -- where to go.  Who wants to do what.  You know.  So --
R:  Oh, yeah.  That kind of --
L:  If you keep --
R:  -- travelling I like doing in really small groups.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like [MN] --
L:  And if it's with good friends it's a lot easier.  
R:  Yeah, 'cause you -- you already know like that, oh, this person they don't like to be in smoky restaurants so we won't even look for any.  And, you know, that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- person only wants to eat
