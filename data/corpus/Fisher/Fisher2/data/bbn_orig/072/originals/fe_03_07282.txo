R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Suzanne.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I live in Toronto, Canada.
L:  Oh, well, I'm Jim and I live in Greensboro, Florida.
R:  Oh, very nice.  Nice to meet you, Jim.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you like eating in restaurants or do you like eating at home?
L:  [NOISE] Well, actually I prefer eating at home.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, you do?  So -- so --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- do I actually.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] we -- um, my -- I'm married to an Italian --
L:  Well --
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and, ah, he loves his pasta --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- loves food.  Ah, so there's nothing --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like, you know, a nice home cooked lasagna.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Or, um, we make our sauce every week and, ah, we have pasta three times a week and he really enjoys that.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I --
R:  -- what about you?
L:  [COUGH] I, um, am not really fond of pasta.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I can eat it.  My daughter-in-law makes a fantastic lasagna.
R:  Mm.
L:  And my wife makes a great spaghetti.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, great.  That's good.
L:  So, ah, that's probably about my -- my doings of pasta.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, [COUGH] I'm a -- I guess I'm kind of a meat and potato man.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm a hunter, I love to hunt.  Um, I like to hunt deer, which venison we have a lot of --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  -- and we love to eat venison and in -- in all kind of ways.
R:  That's something I've never had the opportunity to try. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it is -- it is great.  It is low in cholesterol, ah, it's a -- well, the doctors say it's kind of a perfect meat.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, it -- it's, ah -- h- has hardly any fat to it.  Ah, my better half makes it in, ah, chili.  She makes stew from it.  Ah, last hunting season she told me, she says, "Honey, I wish you'd, ah, shoot a cow.  I'm getting kind of tired of venison".
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You should sell it. [LAUGH]  So, you have a -- a freezer and you just, um --
L:  Ah, yes, yup -- 
R:  -- cut it up and --
L:  -- we have a freezer.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, and as a --
R:  That sounds great.
L:  -- matter of fact I think I shot four this year.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And my son-in-law, ah, has shot three or four.  I have a six year old granddaughter that shot one and a seventeen year old granddaughter that shot one.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, my goodness.
L:  So, we like to get out in the woods.  Both of my boys are, ah, duck hunters.
R:  Okay.
L:  And we eat -- eat duck also.
R:  I've -- I've cooked duck a couple of times.  Um, I brought one back from, um, [LIPSMACK] a visit to Quebec.  I, ah -- we were on vacation and on my last day I -- I went shopping in a market and I bought a very nice duck and I made it in an orange sauce and, ah --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- that was good.  That was very different.
L:  That -- that sounds pretty fair. [COUGH]
R:  Mhm, it was good.
L:  We usually -- we usually deep fat fry it.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Which is -- is good.  Ah, I'm sixty eight years old and I'm not supposed to eat fried food, but that's about the only way we like it really.
R:  Hey, you got to live, right?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We, ah -- we like almost, well, just about all kinds of meat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I like seafood, which I presume maybe you do?
R:  Oh, yes.  Well, I'm originally from Australia.  I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I've been in Canada for twenty three years.  But, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I, um, my father, like you're a hunter, my father was, um, [LIPSMACK] a fisherman.  All his spare time he would spend catching fish from the ocean --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, ah, I grew up eating fish for breakfast [LAUGH] sometimes.
L:  Well, what a- -- what about something like gator tail or frog legs?
R:  I never tried those.  It sounds --
L:  Never tried 'em?
R:  No, it sounds interesting.
L:  It -- it -- believe it or not, they are very, very good.
R:  And that's common to find in, ah -- in Florida in a restaurant?
L:  Yes, quite common in Florida.  Another one is, they don't serve it in restaurants, but if you, [LAUGH] and you're going to probably say, "Ooh" but we, ah -- we also will eat rattlesnake.
R:  Rattlesnake?
L:  Yes, it's a --
R:  And it's --
L:  -- very, very, ah, good white flaky meat when fixed right.
R:  Like chicken?  Like chicken? [LAUGH]
L:  Similar.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Similar, yes.  It -- it has a chicken taste to it.
R:  Wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So with all those choices, ah, why go to a restaurant, right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Um, when my wife and I do go out to a restaurant, um, well, even living in Florida, w- we -- we both kind of have a tendency to go towards seafood.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Um, like I say, we get steak and -- and venison and chicken and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all the other staples at -- at home you might say.
R:  Yeah.  When we go, also I have two children, a thirteen year old and a ten year old.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, we usually go somewhere where we can have some nice barbecue chicken or something like that.
L:  Okay.
R:  Or we'll go out for pizza.  Ah, that's --
L:  Yeah, well now --
R:  -- basically what we do.
L:  -- that's another one.  We -- we, ah -- that's another one that both my wife and I like, are pizza -- is pizza.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If we're going out and -- we have a company down here called CC's.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And four ninety nine we can go in and eat all the kind of pizzas we want with a salad and, I mean, really totally pig out. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Which you're not supposed to do either, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yes, ah --
R:  Oh, that sounds good.  Well, on Sunday we actually had a restaurant come to our house.  It was my son's confirmation [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I had over twenty people at the house and --
L:  Wow, you did have your hands full, didn't you?
R:  -- I decided not to cook, so we ordered the food [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- and for two hundred and forty dollars we had so much.  It was , ah -- because the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family's Italian I had an Italian restaurant do it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we had lasagna and we had a veal parmigiano and, um, [LIPSMACK] chicken in a -- a white sauce, ah, chicken breast.
L:  That sounds great.
R:  We had a huge big, ah, plate of mixed vegetables.  We had roasted potatoes and salad.
L:  Mm.
R:  For two hundred and forty dollars, you couldn't beat it.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  We're still eating.  I still have a fridge full of food, so [LIPSMACK] that --
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- that was kind of nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I just went to my fl- fiftieth class reunion.
R:  Oh, okay.  Great.
L:  Last weekend.
R:  Wow.
L:  And we had, again it was catered, part of it was catered.  Um, we had, ah, barbecued beef, pork and chicken.
R:  Mm.
L:  And then a lot of the local ladies brought, ah, casseroles and potato salad and, ah, all different things.  And we just -- we ate just really quote high on the hog.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was --
R:  Talking --
L:  -- it was fantastic.
R:  Talking of hogs and ribs and things, um, it just reminded me once a year we have a rib fest here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there are different people from the States will come up and they sell --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- their ribs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's one that we really like and it's called, I think, gator ribs.  And it's from somewhere in Florida.  And they are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so good.  My --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, my -- my kids have never had ribs like it.  Yeah.
L:  Ahah.
R:  Really, really good and --
L:  Well, we have a lot of wild hogs down here too.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  So if -- if we want some pork, ah, if you get a -- a nice sow, you know what I mean, young and so forth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it -- it's pretty good.  But if you get a boar or one of the older ones, ah, the meat's not that good.
R:  Bit tough, right?
L:  Right.
R:  It would be tough?
L:  Very tough.  But, um, if you can -- if you can get a nice one, I mean, again you can -- ah, you can just -- I -- I've cooked 'em on the grill.  Ah, my better half has, ah, um, baked 'em.  And i- it's very good eating.
R:  Sou- --
L:  Very good eating.
R:  Sounds like you save a lot of money on your meat bills, right?  You don't --
L:  Well, yes.
R:  -- spend too much?
L:  We really do.  We -- we really do.  My wife is a couponder.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, she -- that's -- that's her kinda -- her job, you might say.  And, well, matter of fact today we went to grocery and our bill was, ah, sixty something dollars, and by the time she gave the coupons, I think we ended up for about thirty something dollars.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, amazing.
L:  So --
R:  That's great.
L:  -- that helps us out.
R:  That's -- yup, it cer- -- it certainly does.
L:  It -- it's a quite -- quite a -- quite a thing.
R:  Oh, because I have a thirteen year old who, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, well, he's -- he's not a big fat boy but he's tall and he's growing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right?  And, ah, he's very slim but he's five nine and he can --
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- put it away.  And I mean --
L:  Oh, I can imagine.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- w- -- my seventeen year old grandson, or eighteen year old grandson just graduated from high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's staying with us this summer, working for his uncle who is a veterinarian.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
L:  And then he's starting into college in the fall.
R:  Oh.
L:  And we notice our food bill go up just a little bit too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I notice he -- my son went away today to Quebec City for a week with his class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and tonight I looked in the fridge, gosh, you know, only one glass of milk is gone --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from my daughter. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, he'll drink a liter of milk just himself at dinner time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, ah --
L:  'Cause tonight --
R:  -- yeah, I know.
L:  -- my daughter and her three grandchildren are -- my three grandchi- -- her children are down tonight and, um, my wife got some chicken today.  And we're having chicken and just broccoli casserole and some, ah, pasta.
R:  Mm.
L:  And, ah, we've been just eating that and they're -- they're putting it away.  I -- I hope I got a drumstick left when I get back.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So you're -- you're doing this before dinner?  You're doing this talk now before dinner and talking about food is going to make you really hungry. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, actually no, it's dinner time here.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- we just finished.
L:  It's -- it's, um -- it's about, well, let's see.  It's quarter to -- no it's twenty after seven here.
R:  Mhm.  Yes it's -- we're on the same time zone then.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.
R:  We're on the time zone.
L:  All right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very good.
R:  So, yeah --
L:  Well, we just -- we just went through your lovely country, ah, last year --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
L:  -- on our way to, um -- on our way to, ah, Canada.
R:  Oh --
L:  I mean Alaska.
R:  Oh.
L:  We didn't come through Quebec or anything, but we went through the Yukon and, ah, we went through, um, Alberta, British Colombia and northern -- the northern, ah, one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And then on into Alaska.
R:  Oh, so you must have tried some Canadian food then, ah, I guess?  So you had --

R:  -- some of the beef and, ah
