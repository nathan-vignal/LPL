L:  Hi, my name's Brittany Olsen.  And I'm twenty years old.  And I live in Rexburg[?], Idaho.
R:  Hi, I'm, uh -- my name's Lily and I, uh, I'm twenty seven and I live in Cambridge, Massachussetts.  
L:  Oh, nice to meet you.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Nice to meet [LAUGH] you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, so what do you think about the topic?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, interesting.  
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]  Well, I guess it's, uh, I -- I gue- -- I suppose I would prefer, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my age, I guess to have a lot more closer friends versus --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] a wider, you know, arrangement of friends.  
L:  Right.
R:  Which I used to have when I was younger.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What about yourself?  
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm in college right now [LAUGH] so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I have like a lot of different acquaintances.
R:  Right.  
L:  But really I only have, I don't know, probably like five really close friends that I hang out with all the time and stuff so, um, I'm probably the same way though.  Just my personality.  Like I kind of like, you know, my little group of friends and I don't usually go out and do new things with a lot --
R:  Like, you --
L:  -- of new people.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  You don't go to one of those events where it's like meet, uh, a new person every five minutes or something?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I don't -- I'm not really that personality so ...
R:  Right.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  What about you when you were younger though?  Did you do that and ...?
R:  Um, probably just, uh, you know, when I was a little bit younger I used to just go out and, uh, go to more social events and just meet random people, like fraternities and sort --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- and stuff.  And just to hang out but, of course, after a while you don't really get a close connection with them so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's, you know, you kind of lose touch and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you -- you kind of revert back to your close circle of friends for everything else.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  It's [LAUGH] true.  It's true.  So, um, what do you think has made you change in that way?  Like you don't -- like are you married or --
R:  Um, I'm not --
L:  -- you ...?
R:  -- married yet but, uh, after graduating from college round, like, twenty four, twenty five, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Having a full time job you really don't get the same amount of time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or you don't get the social interaction that you used to before.  So versus --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yourself where I'm sure you have a lot of class projects or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you get to meet with a lot -- a lot of new people anyways on a regular basis which is -- it gets a lot harder when, you know, you have a regular job and you see kinda like the same people everyday and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's like, okay, you either [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  You either --
L:  Right.
R:  -- see them and you go to work and you see them all day so you don't -- you don't really want to go hang out with them after work.
L:  Right.
R:  That's 'cause you're like, okay, well I've seen you for --
L:  You're with 'em all day [LAUGH] long.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- I already seen you for eight hours.  I don't want to see you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- after work.  So it's okay.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]  I don't know. It's -- it just seems pretty, like, natural thing just because you got more involved with your own life, you know.  It's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] and people move away.  And people are harder to just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- keep in touch with a lot of people.  
L:  Right, so the friends that you have now.  Are they friends that you've had, you know, for a really long time or, like, how do you know them, stuff like that?
R:  Yeah, I guess my closer friends, um, I have one or two that I've known since ...  Well, one, um, of my closest friends I've known since, like, fourth grade.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, it's like there were --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- times when, you know, when I went off to college so we kind of left -- lost touch but we --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, reconnect every few years or so and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then we're normal again but a lot of other people, mainly from college and also from high school.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  And it's just -- it -- you -- you just seem to develop, I guess, your goals, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- tends to be the same after a while and, you know, you kinda stick with the same type of people where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as -- as, you know, you're into, I don't know, making tons and tons of money.  And like [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You have other friends or, you know, who wants to become like hermits or something.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  You probably will start losing touch with them so ...
L:  Right. 
R:  I don't know.  I mean, how long have you been going to college for?  Or in college for?
L:  Um, this is my second year so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  So, I mean, you know, you -- I'm sure your first year you kinda was exposed to a lot of things that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you weren't used to in high school, or whatever, and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- was like exciting and new. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And everything you now, I don't know, you -- you probably found like a group of people where --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you feel most comfortable with. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't know, it -- it just seems to kinda evolve over time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'm sure you'll get there.  When you get to my age, not that I'm that old.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah, you're not that old.  Did you say you're twenty seven?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, that's not -- na.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You [LAUGH] got -- [LAUGH] that's not old.  I can't wait to get actually a couple more years on me.  You know, I just --
R:  [LAUGH]  Really?  You're still waiting for that one extra year when you're twenty one, right?  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I guess.  Yeah.  Although I don't know how much different my life will [LAUGH] be now -- 
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- at twenty one so ...
R:  I -- I always think like, "Boy, when I was, you know, in junior high --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- I was really stupid".  [LAUGH] 
L:  I [LAUGH] kn- -- [LAUGH]  I know.  And you always think when I'm twenty, life is gonna be so great and then when I'm twenty five life --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- is gonna so much better, you know.  But you just have to be like, well, [LIPSMACK] this is life and ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] You know.  So ...
R:  [MN]  How -- how have you, uh, kept most of your friends?  Like did you know them for a really long time?
L:  Um, well, like I actually have moved around a lot.  Like, um, growing up and stuff.  Like I first lived in L.A.
R:  Mm.
L:  Growing up.  And then I lived in Houston and, like, in between there we moved all around, but those are the two main places.  And then, um, for high school we lived in Utah.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And so, like, my friends in California and Houston, like I've got a couple close friends from both of those places and with them it -- it's kinda di- -- I mean, we just send like the letters, you know, every once in a while.  Like Christmas cards and things like that.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  But it's really funny.  It's so interesting because when I get together with those people which, in fact, like a couple of my friends from Houston ended up moving to Salt Lake --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I've been able to get together with them a couple of times.  And it's like no time has gone by.  You know, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're those kind of friends that you just -- it doesn't matter if you haven't talked for five years [LAUGH] like you'll --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- still get along and everything.
R:  You just feel to be connected.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  So ...  Like I don't see those people very often.  Um, and actually the way I became friends with them was through church probably.  Like they are my same religion so we met in church group and stuff but the other people, like from school, I kind of lost contact with.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and most of my friends from high school actually I have lost contact with.  I haven't -- a lot of them are [LAUGH] married.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And they're my age.  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]  Really?  Wow.
L:  So ...  Yeah.  And I'm sure it's just the culture, you know, so ...
R:  Is that in Texas or is that in [LAUGH] L.A.?
L:  Well, that -- that was from Utah.  Like when I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in high school in Utah.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  And, um, yeah, it's really strange.  Like my really good friend from high school now is having her second baby so, I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  She's only a year older than me and I'm thinking, "Oh, my goodness.  I got a few years [LAUGH] to wait".  You know.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, I have --
L:  So ...
R:  I have like a close girlfriend and, um, she's like a few years younger than me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She's probably like five years younger than me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, before when I was just going through college she kinda just like went [MN] on one of her wild trips and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- decided to fall eventually [MN] she has two kids now and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and is like married and I think --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- she just turned twenty one.  I'm just, whoa.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  That's so strange.  Because just, you know I'm still good friends with her -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but she's -- I just seen her change so much.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, just from I, maybe, just becoming a parent or whatever, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, I've -- I just -- for me, I just can't see it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I want to be a mother and I want to get --
R:  Eventually, yeah. 
L:  -- married.  Yeah. 
R:  But ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  But not right now 'cause I look at my friends too and, you know, they are different.  They, you know, they live for their kids, which is good.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, that they do that but ...  
R:  Right.
L:  It's true they are so different and they can't go out and play and have fun and --
R:  Yeah, I think that's --
L:  -- all those things.  
R:  -- also the other thing was like friends too when you grow older and people are having families and stuff.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You just kinda, like, can't call your girlfriend and say, "Hey, let's stay out 'til --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- two in the morning [several inaudible words]".  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, exactly.
R:  It's like, "I have a husband here back home too" or something like that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just a lot harder.  Did you find it pretty [MN] you must be very use to, like, making new friends, I guess.  
L:  Um --
R:  Having --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- moved around so much and ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  And -- yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.  I'm kind of -- it's funny 'cause like I -- I don't know.  Like I'll -- I'll make friends and stuff but I usually don't hang out with people unless they invite me to hang out with.  Like I'm not the type that's just like gets a group together and, you know, let's all go play.  Let's go dancing or, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's usually people either from church or from my classes, or something, that just invite me to [LAUGH] go and so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah, like I make friends that way but they're still not like my close, close friends.  Like the -- the close friends I've met in college were, like -- I had a couple of roommates last year that I'm really good friends with now.
R:  Mhm
L:  And I hang out with them a lot because they're up here.  I don't live with them anymore but --
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  So I mostly hang out with my roommates and things but, um ...  I don't know I also like my -- my personal time.  [LAUGH]  I like my space --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so ...
