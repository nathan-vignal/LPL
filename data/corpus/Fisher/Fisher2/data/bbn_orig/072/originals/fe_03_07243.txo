L:  How you doing?
R:  Hi.
L:  [NOISE] Well, the d- -- the topic of the day is food and, um, my name is Sabrina.
R:  Ah, my name's Rich.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, you want to start? [NOISE]
R:  Ah, sure.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think my -- I think I, ah, prefer eating out, um, it's obviously a lot more expensive.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, um -- and I can't do it that often, [LAUGH] but I do like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eating out because I don't like to cook.
L:  Yeah, same here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially when the hot summer's coming.  Now, who wants to be standing over a hot stove, you know?
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  [MN]
R:  Or clean up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Um, I like eating at buffets overall --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have a more of -- a -- a wider variety selection.
R:  I -- I -- I agree with you.  I totally agree with you.  The only thing is, um, I kind of have to watch myself, so, ah, with buffets I kind of [LAUGH] eat way too much.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, um, I, ah -- and there aren't that many buffets around me, so, um, I tend to go to, ah, like cheaper restaurants.  I live in a college town so they have a -- a lot of nice cheap restaurants.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but not many buffets for some reason.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um --
L:  Wh- wh- which city are you in?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  I'm in, ah, Seattle.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Must be, ah, across the United States.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, what kind of food do you typically like?
L:  Um, I like, ah, light pastas, you kn- -- like, I like light starches like pasta, rice.  Um, I like, ah, citrus fruits --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like oranges.  I like peaches.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Anything that tastes good. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  I, ah, have to agree with you on that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- I really like spicy foods.  I, um -- the spicier the better.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  How can you handle it? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I don't know.  I -- I guess I've just been eating spicy a -- a long time, but, ah, I just really, really like spicy foods.  I, ah -- the heat really -- I really like the heat.
L:  Mm.
R:  Ah, there's this one restaurant I go to, ah, speaking of the perfect meal, and they have this hot sauce on the table and, ah, it's so hot that it actually makes my scalp sweat. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  It's, ah -- it's, ah -- but it's -- it's a good heat.  I like it.
L:  Mm.  That's pretty good.
R:  Ah, what would you describe as your perfect meal?
L:  My perfect meal would have like, um, a little bit of the four food groups.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like, um -- I like fried chicken.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I also like, um -- like it when, ah -- when they have the, ah -- the -- the, ah -- the pork boiled sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] I also like to have one of my favorite pastas on there.  It could be either, um, you know, something light like, um, angel hair pasta or mashed potatoes.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And have a little bit of, um -- I like to have, um, some light bread.  I don't -- I don't -- I don't like eating bread that has all that yeast and stuff in it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I like tortillas mostly.
R:  Yeah.  Ah --
L:  But, um --
R: So --
L:  -- sometimes I would eat like biscuits or, ah, [NOISE] those sweet orion -- Hawaiian rolls.
R:  Mm.  Oh, yeah, I like those.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so neither of us cook very much, but, ah, when you do cook, ah, what do you cook at home?  I usually cook like prepared stuff.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So like --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- just heat it up.
L:  I like little a package of noodles, like, ah, Top Ramen or Maruchan.  And I could put like a margarine, salt, pepper, if I had mushrooms I'd put those in there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a little meat.
R:  Well, I've actually never tried that.  Are you -- I like -- I also like, ah, like the prepacks of ramen noodles, but I don't, ah, I don't put stuff in it.  I never thought about doing that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And the little package things that come with 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Tho- -- that stuff is so salty --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- but if you put just a little bit of -- like at least half of it in there and stir it up really good, it's not that bad.
R:  Oh, oh, I'll try that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I have lots of those being a, ah, student. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's one of my primary staples in my diet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  And, ah, I like to ha- -- I like to eat cereals, you know, like -- especially like, ah, Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  I -- for the plain Cheerios I put like, um, [NOISE] a little, ah, honey in there.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Give it a little flavor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I use, ah, organic milk.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  And it's -- it's fat in organic but you can also -- there -- there's organic and fat free.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause, ah, the fat in there, [NOISE] that's the part that holds all the -- those innat- unnatural hormones.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and it -- and it gives m- -- it makes me, you know, gives me the runs, [LAUGH] really bad.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Actually I'm -- I'm a little lactose intolerant, so I, ah -- I recently started drinking soy milk and it's re- -- actually really, really good.
L:  Hm.
R:  It takes -- it --
L:  Those -- have you tried the stuff called, ah, Lactate?
R:  Yeah, I have tried that.  I have tried that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but it's like, ah, the flavor is really bland.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Whereas with soy milk it tastes like milk and it feels like milk.  But it's like, ah -- it's like a very strong vanilla flavor.
L:  Mm.
R:  So it's sort of like, ah, you know you're eat- -- you're drinking something that's not healthy 'cause it's so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- sweet.  But it's very good.
L:  It's all right.
R:  Supposedly it's good for you.
L:  Yeah, wa -- they have something far everybody, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  They'll -- they'll find something.
L:  Yep.  In the near future, um -- I recently moved up to north Seattle, which is about -- just a little south of Sh- -- the city called Shoreline, and, ah, we have a buffet about maybe, if you're driving it's probably like five minutes up the road.  It's called Old Country Buffet.
R:  Oh, yeah, we have some of those.
L:  [COUGH] And, ah, when I used to live in California, [NOISE] in a small town called Fairfield --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there was a really good buffet up there in a plaza across the street from the mall we ha- -- we had up there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's called, ah, J.J. Nort's.
R:  Oh, I've never heard of that. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, ah -- speaking of buffets, I -- I, um -- the buffets I tend to really, really like [LAUGH] are Chinese food buffets.
L:  Oh, yeah, I've been to those too.
R:  Yeah, but the thing is I eat way too much. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  The -- the -- I mean, the oriental people, they really feed you.  They give you big healthy portions you can eat -- I could eat off there for three days, you --
R:  Yeah, really, [LAUGH] I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  And the -- and the stuff, um, it -- it's true what they say, it's like you'll eat it and get full, but like a couple of minutes later, it's like you could eat a lot more.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Their food has no real fat in it at all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what I like, is, um -- like certain buffets, like, put a lot of heavy sauces, but other ones, like, have lots of vegetables that are, like, stir fries.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And in light sauces.  And I -- I like those.  Unfortunately there aren't, for some reason, that many, ah, Chinese food buffets or any type of buffets down here.
L:  Yeah.  I, um -- I've a- -- I've eaten in a variety of, ah, restaurants.  [NOISE] I've eaten at, ah, the fast food ones of course.  Um, I've eaten at, ah, what is that place?  Um, it's called the Macaroni Grill in Salt --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- Lake City.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I've eaten at Olive Garden.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And also, um, this other buffet called -- they have in Salt Lake City called, um, [MN] ah, [NOISE] [PAUSE] [SIGH] I can't remember, but it -- it -- it's a really good buffet they have up there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, I mean, the food is excellent.  Out of all those ones that I've mentioned that I've eaten at, I've always eaten at -- they have, ah, sometimes they have those, ah, Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants you can actually eat in, has like a little buffet area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That sells, ah, the food that they usually sell, though in, ah, larger portion.  You just go and get how much you want and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they have -- they have one of those at a city called Sandy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, which is about maybe thirty miles away from Salt Lake.
R:  Yeah.  So you're from Utah?
L:  Well, I lived in Utah, but I grew up -- actually grew up in California.
R:  Oh, I see, I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, ah, speaking of, ah, the restaurants, ah, the one -- one you mentioned, Macaroni Grill, I've only been there once, but I really, really enjoyed it.  I thought it was very good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, like -- like typically, ah, you know the food in those chain restaurants tend to n- no- not be very good, but I thought it was fair- fairly good.
L:  Yeah.  And another thing about me, I'm a french fry connoisseur.
R:  Oh, me too.  I [LAUGH] love french fries.
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, the fries have got to be cooked tender.  I don't want those old hard cold stale ones that have been sitting up in there for hours --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Which french fries, ah, do you like best?
L:  Um, I like the big chunky steak fries.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  The ones that don't have the skins on 'em, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Do you like, ah, McDonalds fries?  They -- they, ah, are --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- supposed to be pretty famous.  I -- I like 'em, but they're not that great.
L:  Sometimes.  It all depends on who's cooking 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Sometimes you can get -- I can get a good amount -- a good, um, ah, plate of 'em, but sometimes not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes they in a rush and they don't get around to making any fresh ones.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Especially at the height of the day when they get a lot of customers in.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So if you're -- if you're still getting a s- -- ah, a crop of those old ones before they get the new ones --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?
R:  The ones that are soaked in oil and all.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I like fries too.  I, ah -- I -- that's another thing I have to watch out for.  Um, I tend to eat too much of those. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Have you tried the, um, Dr Atkins diet?
R:  Um, actually I did.  I think I -- I actually tried that briefly.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, it -- it seemed to work.  I was losing weight but, ah, [MN] I, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just wasn't very good.  Like, I couldn't eat all that meat.
L:  Mm.
R:  It was just too much. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Basically you -- you can eat what you want, but not so much of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, you got to s- -- portion it off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And especially if you do the diet with someone else, you know, it makes it a lot easier for you to have your -- keep your will power intact.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause food is very addictive.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I don't care what --
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I don't care what people say, you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  They say, well, "Oh, yeah, I can eat as m- -- I can eat just a little bit here and there", but they end up eating like the whole refrigerator.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  That's me.
L:  So you got to have -- yeah, you got to be able to do it with someone that has the same goal as you have and you -- you can kind of like watch each other.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  The only way I was able to lose [NOISE] a little weight was, ah, just to stop eating.
