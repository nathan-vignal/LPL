L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  
R:  Hi.  
L:  Yes.  This is -- this is Sonia.
R:  Hi, my name's Michelle.
L:  Oh, hi, Michelle.
R:  This is the first time I've ever done one of these calls.  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  This is about my third one.  
R:  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I don't know how you're supposed to just get into it or ...
L:  Um, just go ahead and start talking, so I'll start.  Uh, well, basically, I much prefer eating at a restaurant than at home.  
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Yeah.  I always like food prepared by someone else.  [LAUGH]  And, um, I -- let's see, I used to live overseas, and then especially I was out eating a lot.  I lived in Tokyo and --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  My favorite restaurant there was a -- a garlic restaurant and so you'd go there and they had garlic dishes of different Asian, um, cuisines and so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they had his garlic bread that was amazing.
R:  Wow.
L:  It was french bread turned -- it was just like a -- a baguette and then it had garlic piled on it and then you stomp it down into the -- into the bread.  It was so good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Real buttery.  So ...  Um, so when we've missing that restaurant.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Now that I've been back in the States for a few years.  
R:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in the Detroit area now.
R:  Oh.  I'm in Jersey.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah, we used to live in Germany so I like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a lot of German food.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah.  But they have a pizza place here that is just the best pizza in the world.  It's called Donado's[?] Pizza.  
L:  Mm.
R:  And they don't use mozzarella cheese.  They use provolone and cheddar mixed together.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And they put over a hundred pieces of pepperoni on one of their large pizzas.  It's --
L:  [MN]
R:  It's so good. 
L:  Oh, that is.
R:  It's the best pizza in the world.  
L:  Really?  Yeah, it sounds good.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Okay.  And that, would you say, is your favorite restaurant?
R:  Um, probably.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't cook too much --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know.  I don't like to cook so --
L:  No.
R:  -- when -- I definitely prefer eating out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or having food delivered.  
L:  Right.  
R:  So ...  [COUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I guess it's kind of hard to talk for ten minutes on -- on one subject, huh?
L:  Uh, no, once you get used to it.  The last one I had was, um, let's see, family and, let's see, before that was censorship so ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Wasn't too -- it's not too bad.  It's -- you just get used to it after a couple of times.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, so this is your last call then, huh?
L:  Um, it said up to three calls but it -- it might, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people and, I don't know, I've gotten a few -- I had one, uh, that came in pretty late in the evening and I guess they couldn't find another person willing so ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, it was, yeah.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  Uh, back to food.  What else do I like?  Oh, there was a -- another place there in Tokyo that was an Indian restaurant.  I really liked their, um, butter chicken and it was really sweet.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That sounds good.
L:  Delicious.
R:  Yeah.  Were you in the military or something?
L:  Oh no.  No, I just -- I had gone over there when I was in college to study and then once I came back here I decided I wanted to go back.  
R:  Oh.
L:  After I worked in my field a while here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I decided, and I just took off and went.
R:  Wow.
L:  Went over on what's called the JET program.  Japan Exchange Teaching and I was a teacher. 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's interesting.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mm.  [COUGH]  So ...  Well, [COUGH] I don't know what else we can talk about, about food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
R:  I'm actually having, um, gastric bypass surgery.  
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  In a couple more weeks.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  So I'm trying to eat all my favorite foods now because after surgery I'm not gonna be able to have any kind of junk food or sugar or caffeine or anything again for the rest of my life.
L:  Wow.  
R:  So I'm like --
L:  So are -- are you afraid?
R:  -- eating all my favorite foods now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my gosh.  So how much weight did you want to lose?
R:  Um, about ninety pounds.
L:  Yeah.  I need to lose that much but I'm not definitely -- I -- I don't really think I'd be a good candidate for the surgery.
R:  No?  [COUGH]
L:  No.
R:  My doctor [MN] he's doing it, um, laparoscopically.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  So they only make like a couple little punch in your stomach.
L:  Mm.
R:  My collating's[?] going off.  So ...  [COUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  Hopefully.  Um, but ...
L:  So -- so then, let's see, you're not gonna be able to eat more than a little bit at a time, right?
R:  Yeah.  You -- you can only eat like an ounce at a time.  
L:  Oh.
R:  So ...  And everything has to be sugar free.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.  
R:  Yeah.  So ...  [COUGH] 
L:  Sugar free?  Why is that?
R:  Um, because if you eat anything with a lot of sugar in it all the blood kind of like leaves your head and it rushes to your stomach, and it makes you have this feeling called dumping syndrome.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And, um, [COUGH] I'm not exactly sure what it is but it makes you like really sick.  It makes you feel nauseous and, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- dizzy and I've heard that people that it had happened to them once and then they won't let it happen again.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So that kind of makes you not want to eat sweets because it's such an unpleasant feeling.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  So ...  
L:  Hm.  
R:  Yeah, but I'm having it done in a couple a weeks so ...  
L:  Wow.  
R:  Definitely been eating out a lot lately so I can have all my favorite foods.  All my McDonalds and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pizzas and all that good stuff.  So ...
L:  Mm.  Wow, that's --
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, then you should -- I mean, food is definitely a topic for, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It is.
L:  It is, I would think, of great interest to you right now.  
R:  Yes, but [COUGH] uh, it's -- I think it's gonna be hard for me to go the rest of my life 'cause I have a eight year old little daughter and she likes to eat junk food.  And she's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- she's completely skinny.  But I think it's gonna be really hard for me 'cause she's still gonna want to eat junk food and I'm gonna have to watch her eat all my favorite food.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm not gonna be able to eat it so ...
L:  Wow.  
R:  It -- it's gonna be really hard.  
L:  Are you married?
R:  No.  Single.
L:  [MN]  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mm.
R:  [MN]  Are you married?
L:  No.  I'm single too.
R:  No?
L:  I have no kids.  
R:  No?
L:  Wow.  Yeah, that's --
R:  Yeah, I just have -- I just have one kid.  
L:  Mm.  Yeah, that will be a challenge.  But --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I guess if you have no choice you have no choice.  
R:  Yeah.  In the first couple a weeks after surgery you have to eat baby food.
L:  Ew.
R:  [inaudible] for -- yeah, or something that's that consistency.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  So ...  [COUGH]  I have to eat like a lot of sugar free diet jello and popsicle -- sugar free popsicles and all that right after surgery so ...
L:  Mm.  
R:  Like the first couple a days you can't have any calories at all.
L:  So what led you to decide to do the surgery as opposed to other ...?
R:  Well, I saw, um, Montel[?] Williams years ago where people had it and they lost a lot of weight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I've been looking for a doctor ever since that would do it.  'Cause, I mean, I -- I just can't go on a diet.  I love to eat.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And with this surgery, you know, you don't -- you can't eat that stuff anymore because you're gonna get really, really sick.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that's a pretty good incentive to -- to not --
L:  Right,
R:  -- want to eat.  You know.
L:  Right.  
R:  But I have no willpower as far diets go.  
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]  They have a lot of Chinese restaurants here that are all you can eat, where I live, and they have, um, crab legs in all of them 'cause we live so close to the shore.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  So ...  [COUGH]  So we go there a lot.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  [MN]  
L:  Well ...  So your, um, your last several days of eating food.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  That -- that would be hard.  I think I would -- I would not even consider that.  But then, you know, never say never.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I feel like I'm getting to a point in my weight where I need to make some extreme --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- decision as well but it wouldn't be that one.  Definitely not.  It just -- it, uh, I know I can -- -- I've -- I've been, you know, much smaller before.  I've come back from living in Japan and over there I was, uh, living in a walking city whereas now I live in a, you know, just pretty much drive to -- to every pla- type of place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...  
R:  Well, I heard --
L:  And, uh --
R:  -- people in Japan are like thin anyway because they eat like healthy food.
L:  Um, that's true to a -- a point.  But they eat the same -- some of the same things we eat here too.  So, yes, it's partly true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Their diet is becoming more westernized.  They have a lot of fast food over there as well.  
R:  Really?
L:  But it's just kind of a different culture.  I guess it depends on the city too but, yeah, most people there are more thin.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- and I was a lot more thinner.  I've gained about fifty pounds since I came back from Japan.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know the --
L:  So [MN] it's -- it's --
R:  -- States is bad for junk food, so ...
L:  Yeah, the food here and then the lack of exercise in the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- culture.  You know, just by [MN], um, not walking in the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- city.  If I lived, say, in New York I think I'd be doing a lot better.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right where you have -- if I lived in a commuter city.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I was eating, I feel like, pretty similarly but because I was walking everywhere and then I did exercise as well, but I used to ride my bike to work as well.  
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  [COUGH]  Well, I do a lot of walking.  But I don't lose any weight because I just eat so much.  So ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And now it's like every -- everything that I eat it's like knowing that this could be my last one.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Before my surgery so ...
L:  So have you been gaining weight lately?
R:  Actually I have been because I've been trying to eat everything before --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I have to give it up.
L:  [MN]  
R:  So ...
L:  Well, so how -- how do you think you'll adjust?
R:  Um --
L:  With not having your favorite foods?
R:  Well, after surgery you have to because otherwise , you know, it can kill you.  Your stomach can rupture and ...
L:  Ew.
R:  Plus you can get the, you know, that dumping syndrome so ...
L:  Right.  
R:  You know, after surgery you really don't have a choice.  
L:  Mm.
R:  You have to do it.
