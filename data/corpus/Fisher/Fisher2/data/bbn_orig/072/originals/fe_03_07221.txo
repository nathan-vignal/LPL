R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Hi, I'm Vanessa.
R:  Hi, my name is Rima.
L:  Hi.  It's nice to meet you.  
R:  Same here.
L:  Is this your first one or have you had other calls?
R:  No, this is my last one act- --
L:  Your last one?  Okay. 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, um, I guess we're supposed to talk about friends?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, [MN] go ahead and I'll just chime in whenever.  
R:  Um, are you just the type that has a lot of friends or just a couple close ones?
L:  Um, [SIGH] well, I'm like a l- -- I mean, I like a lot of people.  I mean, I have a lot of acquaintances but as far close friends I just have just a couple of them.  
R:  Yes.
L:  I have one that -- that I've known since high school.  So, yeah, I think that, um, just one really.  One really close one.  But, uh --
R:  I have a couple of really close ones.  I have a lot of friends though[?].  Just --
L:  So do you, um --
R:  -- [MN] --
L:  Do they live close or ...?
R:  Yeah, they all live close.  
L:  Oh.  See now I have one that, um, she lives about, oh, probably eight hundred [LAUGH] miles away so that makes it difficult but we email each other a lot so ...
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  But, uh -- and then my other one just lives here in town.  We have kids the same age so we get to see each other a lot.  So have you known your friends for -- I mean, has it been since you were kids or ...?
R:  Um, see I'm twenty two.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  I've known her since I was like ten.  We went to school together and just ...
L:  Well, yeah, I [MN] --
R:  There's only one that I really, really close with.  My best friend.
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm forty two so I've had [LAUGH] time to -- I've had time.  I've had -- I've had one friend.  Th- the one friend that I have we've been friends since high school so ...  But, um, we lost touch with each other for, oh, [SIGH] maybe seven or eight years and then, um, we showed up -- we were both pregnant at the same time and we were in childbirth class together.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And we've been -- we've been friends since then because our -- our, um, our oldest are like seven weeks apart and our youngest are, um, oh, about three months apart.  So -- so that kinda kept us close -- closer now we live in the same town.  Before we didn't but, um ...  So do you think, uh, do you think it's more important to have a lot of friends or a close friend?
R:  No, I don't --
L:  I was talking -- I was talking with my daughters about this the other day so I didn't --
R:  No, I don't think it's imp- -- uh, when I was in high school, yeah.  But as I grow up more I don't think friends are really that important.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I know my -- my youngest daughter is -- is thirteen and she has a lot of friends.  I mean, you know, she has maybe -- well, she bounces back and forth.  But, you know, she has a -- a new best friend about every two or three months.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then my -- my older one is -- is fifteen and she just has like one or two.  And she doesn't have a big group of friends so it's -- it -- it's really interesting to watch both of them.  So I d- I didn't know whether or not ...
R:  I don't know.  I think just having too much friend is a big headache. 
L:  Well, it -- I think it takes up a lot of your time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  That's for sure. 
R:  I think it's a headache.  
L:  Yeah, and, um, they, uh, I know with -- with my youngest daughter, you know, she's always wanting to go somewhere and do stuff and -- and, uh, kind of spreads herself pretty thin.  So, yeah, I [LAUGH] I think that's true.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, uh, as a matter of fact I watched -- I watched, um, oh, I don't remember what channel it was on.  But it was, um, about the friends that, uh, made their wedding arrangements for [LAUGH] each other and I don't think I've got a friend that I would trust with that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I thought that was interesting.  But, um, so do -- let m- -- uh, do you have, um, guys that are friends or ...?  See, I know when I was in high school my best friends were guys which, you know, I'm -- I know --
R:  I have -- I have both but ...
L:  Yeah.  Um, I know my, like I said, my oldest daughter she's, um, she makes -- I think she makes -- feels more comfortable talking to the -- her guy -- her guy friends than she does even some of the girls but, um, I don't think she feels as, you know, the ones that aren't trying to be boyfriends.  She doesn't feel as -- like there's competition, I guess.  I don't know.  But, um, do you, um, [MN] do you have -- h- how -- how's it different at work with you?
R:  I'm sorry.  What is that?
L:  Are you -- are you at -- do you go to school or do you work or ...?
R:  Well, right now I just had a baby.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, okay.  So your time is [LAUGH] consumed.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh.
R:  She's five months old right now.  
L:  Oh, how neat.  Well, congratulations.  That's wonderful.  
R:  Thank you.  
L:  Um, y- you -- well, enjoy because she's gonna be grown up [LAUGH] before you know it.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, has that changed, um, has that changed your perspective on friends?
R:  Um --
L:  On --
R:  Not really.  
L:  On who are --
R:  I still see my friends the same like I used to before I had her.  
L:  Do -- do any of them have kids?
R:  I'm sorry, what is that?
L:  Do any of them have children?
R:  Um, a few of them do.  But my mom helps me out a lot.  
L:  Well, that, yeah, that's good.  That's what --
R:  Yeah and my mom she's always calling me.  She wants me to drop her off there. 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so when it comes to doing anything with anybody it's not a problem.  
L:  Oh, well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well, that's -- yeah, that's pretty well what -- what we did.  Is we, um, I had, um, I lived with my parents with -- with my first child so, um, they -- they helped me with that.  But, um, I just didn't know whether -- I know that my group of friends changed once I had, uh, once I had kids because they were still out wanting to do stuff that I couldn't do anymore.  For one thing I was too tired but, uh, I just didn't know whether or not that -- that had made a difference that you could tell.  And if you thought that it would change as --
R:  I thought it would change but, no, it hasn't really.
L:  Well, um, do you have -- how old's -- [MN] do you -- do you have like sisters or anything?  Do you have -- are you around older kids?  At all?
R:  Um, I have two younger sisters.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, then --
R:  One is eighteen and one is sixteen.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, then, you -- you used to that then.  You -- you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- should know the, um, the way that -- that it works out.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  My sister's the type too.  Every week she has a new best friend.  
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]  Well, I guess that's normal.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, do you, um, do you have, um, I'm sorry, I'm trying to listen to another conversation here.  We have two phone lines in the house.  
R:  Oh. 
L:  Um, uh, so you -- are you pretty close to your mom then?
R:  Yeah, I'm really close with -- 
L:  Are you?
R:  -- my mom.  
L:  See I know that the one thing that I -- my mom was my best friend for the longest time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I've -- [MN] I [MN] just felt like --
R:  Ever since I got married actually.  Ever since I went out -- came -- went out of the house I've -- left the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I got closer to my mom.
L:  Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that r- really brought us closer together but, um, are your sisters close to her?  I mean, are -- are they -- do they consider her a friend or are they still too --
R:  Um --
L:  -- young to ...?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  Still fighting and [LAUGH] arguing and normal --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- teenagers.  
L:  [NOISE]  Um, yeah, that -- [MN] that -- that's something that I'm -- like I said, I've got -- I've got three.  I've got a seventeen year old son and then my daughters who are fifteen and thirteen and -- and I'm seeing it from a whole new perspective when -- when they get older with the friends and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  But, yeah, I [MN] -- my mom lives with me now so I think that, um, I [LAUGH] she's really actually more of a friend now than she has been, um, so I think it gets better, I think, with -- with her, um, as far as that goes.  Are --
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, are you friends with your sisters?
R:  Yeah, I'm friends with my sisters.
L:  Are you?  Well, see I've got two older sisters.  They're both, um, ten years older than I am and so we've kind of bounced back between being enemies and friends [LAUGH] over the years, 'cause I was much younger than they were.  But, um, uh, I think they're -- they're both [MN] we're friends now.  Um, [MN] on your, um, well, this is really actually about the -- the -- the study.  Um, how, um, how long has it taken you to [MN] to get your three calls?
R:  How long?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just[?] about a month and a half.
L:  Has it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's what I wondered.  'Cause I got my first one about -- about a month and a half ago.  So, um ...
R:  Whenever I get a chance.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, um, I don't know.  I can't -- it's -- [MN] like I said.  You know, like I said, I've got my -- my one friend here that, you know, we used to -- I notice as my kids get older though, and my kids go their separate ways, we don't get to spend as much time together and, um, when the kids were little we, uh, had, you know, we didn't work so we got to spend more time, but now we're both working and, uh, so it's, you know, even though -- even though we don't get to talk to each other as often, um, we still try to keep -- try to
