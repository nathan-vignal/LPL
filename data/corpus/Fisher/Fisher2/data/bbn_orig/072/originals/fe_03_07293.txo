L:  Hi, my name's Jessie.  I'm a college student, uh, from Cambridge, Massachusetts.
R:  Uh, my name is Norie[?] and, um, I am calling from Philadelphia.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Good.  Well, they picked my favorite topic.
L:  Yep.  Me too.  I actually just finished dinner so ...  Um, I'm read- -- definitely ready to talk -- talk about this.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
L:  Um ...
R:  Well, why don't you start?
L:  Okay.  I had a delicious, um, barbecue chicken dinner and, um, there wasn't enough of it so -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- definitely ready for some more.
R:  Did you -- did you make it?  
L:  Um, no.  My dad made it.  I helped a little bit though.
R:  Oh, good.  
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it's so hard to decide whether I like, uh, food at a restaurant or at home better.
R:  Mm.
L:  I think it's -- it -- it depends on which I have less of I guess.  I don't go to restaurants that much so restaurants are kind a special.
R:  Well, I've -- I think I'm reverse.  We do eat out a lot and I've gotten tired of it.  And I think that I've become very disappointed in the quality of the food and, um, get sticker[?] shock sometimes, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I look at the prices and realise, you know, how much it would cost me to make that dinner.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it would probably be so much better.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, this should help with that.  So ...  Pay for a little bit of a meal.  [LAUGH] 
R:  The what?
L:  This -- this call should help with that a little bit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Um ...
R:  Maybe that's how I will celebrate when -- this is --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- this is my third and final call.  Uh --
L:  Um --
R:  But, um, I -- I think we're at two different points of -- of our lives.  Just -- just kind a judging the fact that your dad made you dinner.  
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, I've had a lifetime of dinners out and dinners in.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I -- I've come to enjoy more simple foods because I've done so much eating out and uh, [MN] and I -- I -- I like to have more control --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- over what I eat.  I don't like, uh, the fact that some of it's a mystery --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I'm out.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I don't know.  I think -- I -- I like to be surprised sometimes but, um, I definitely -- it's -- it's fun to cook and -- except that I -- I don't -- I'm -- I don't think I'm at the point where if I cook for myself I'm really in control of what I eat.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, but I -- I think that -- I guess -- I guess my -- I would agree that my ultimate meal, um, would be ha- having a homemade meal.  That's just really specially prepared.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but, I mean, compared to, like, a day to day meal, eating out is still special for me, so that's sort of like semi ultimate meal would be a really good restaurant.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A super ultimate meal would be, uh, homemade.
R:  Well, I mean, I do enjoy, you know, restaurants with friends and that sort of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, some of them have gotten so noisy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that the dining experience, um, is -- is almost painful.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I -- I think a lot of the restaurants today, um, you know, want to create that ambience because it's -- I think it's, uh, [MN] it's part of the world today.  You know, it's -- it's that noise and --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- and, uh, excitement and --
L:  Right.
R:  --so forth.  But we -- when we go out we tend to try to look for places that, um, are quiet.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, my --
L:  Are you --
R:  -- my house is quiet so that's [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that's good.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I -- I, um, it's funny there's this place that my dad and I really like, um, in Chinatown in Boston that has just amazing Chinese food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but it's like [MN] has absolutely zero a- ambience or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- atmosphere.  It's like -- it's really kind of wired and, um, there's just not the sort of comfortable settle down feeling, and my mom hates to go there.  Um, so, I don't know.  It's -- it's interesting that we would rate, I guess, the quality of the food compared to the atmosphere differently.  And I'm wondering -- I wonder why that is.  If it has something to do with --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just our personalities or what.  But, I -- I mean, it could be that, um, I gu- -- um, it -- it might be that -- maybe it's a gender thing.  Do -- could that -- like, do you notice, like, with people you know that people, like males, tend to care more about the taste of the food or the atmosphere?
R:  Um, well, I'm just -- I mean, [MN] the person I'm closest too, of course, is my husband.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, we've kind of grown up together and our tastes have become very similar because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess we've shared the same experiences so, um, I think that, um, he -- he expects to -- when he's going to a re- -- a nice restaurant where you're paying, you know, somewhere in the twenties for an entree.  He -- he --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- expects it to be exceptional.
L:  Right.
R:  For twenties or -- or sometimes thirties if you're in New York.
L:  Right. 
R:  Um, and [MN] it's usually not up to that level.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  Whereas I can --
L:  Are you talking about the qual- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  The overall experience, not just the quality of food?
R:  Oh.  Oh, the o- overall experience.
L:  Right.
R:  Well, I -- I think there's some -- [MN] there's so many parts to that because I think it's, you know, the service.
L:  Right.
R:  And that's, uh, in today's world that's difficult because the waitr- waiter and waitress pool is drawing from [LIPSMACK], um, many different sources and someti- -- you know, you can get lucky in some restaurants and unlucky in [LAUGH] other restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- until you have somebody that really cares and is a professional.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And knows how to make the dining experience special.
L:  Right.  
R:  Uh, or you get, you know, she was just -- you know, they're just doing it to earn a buck in between gigs.  [LAUGH]  That kind --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of thing.  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, uh, you know they -- they forget to bring this and, you know, [MN] -- you know the service sometimes it hinges on the kitchen.
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, but who [MN], you -- you know, do you take it out on but your [LAUGH] server?  
L:  Mhm, yeah.  [MN]
R:  But, no, I -- I would say the whole -- the -- the whole experience is what, um, [LIPSMACK] I would, uh, rate.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it -- it all enters into it.
L:  Right.  I mean, wa- was there something else we were supposed to talk about aside from, uh, ultimate meal?  Or -- I'm -- I'm not [inaudible] ...
R:  Well, it said, do you prefer to eat, uh, [MN] your --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- meals at home or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- out.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, restaurant food and, um, [LIPSMACK] I've -- you know, I said I've gotten to the point where I don't care so much.  First of all it takes a lot of time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I -- I seem to have less of that now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's easier for me to grab something at a market and throw it on the +broiler --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or the grill.
L:  Right.
R:  And I can be doing other things while, you know, whatever it is, is cooking.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, answering phones and, you know, that -- that -- that kind of stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause you can walk around with a cordless phone and multitask.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I mean, I do the cooking at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, you know, that -- that -- that seems to work best for me.  But I -- to tell you the truth I would like to do it every night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I, uh, I -- I -- I -- I would say we average eating home maybe four nights a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and the other nights it might not be convenient for us to eat home so we, you know, eat something out.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I just got back home from college, um, and so basically anything right now beats, like, those dining hall foods.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the home touch or the fancy --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- restaurants or whatever, um, but, so it's sort of hard for me to, like, really rate the ultimate meal.  I can't just, you know ...  The -- the -- the -- the  simple things are really hitting the spot right now.  [LAUGH]  So ...  Um, I don't know --
R:  Why don't [several inaudible words]?
L:  I gu- -- I -- I guess --
R:  So you enjoy your home cooking?
L:  Yep.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep, definitely.  Um, 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I enjoy eating out too, but it's not really sort of -- I guess it's a different kind of experience.  It's sort of more of an adventure kind of thing and it's -- it's, like, my ultimate -- it doesn't necessarily mean I'd want to do it all the time but it is more special just because it's rare.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think too much of anything.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you're away -- away at college and, um, you know, y- you're -- you're stuck with the institutional food.
L:  Right.
R:  And eating out is really special.  I remember when I was in college I used to go out to -- I had a car and I used to, you know, couple times a week I would [LAUGH] go out 'cause I couldn't stand the menu.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So, um, you know, it's -- although they were at different points in our life.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I mean [MN] food is a very important thing in my life.  
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  We -- we do it three times a day and -- and inbetween.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  So I want it to be good.
L:  It's pretty much a continuous process for me.  Um ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  No, I [inaudible]. 
R:  Do you -- do you cook at all?
L:  I don't -- I li- -- I enjoy cooking when I do it, um, but I usually -- I mean I cook a l- -- sort of cook up some pasta for lunch or something but ...
R:  Mhm.  You don't [MN] --
L:  I mean, it's --
R:  You don't like to create things?
L:  Sometimes I do.  I d- -- I haven't done en- -- that much of it in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a while.  Um, I'm actually gonna be in a co op housing in my college next year so that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, where you cook a lot of your own meals which -- that sounds like it could be fun.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Um, but so that -- that'll be a neat opportunity.  
R:  Do you enjoy different cuisines?
L:  Definitely  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I really like ethnic food a lot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [COUGH] and it's -- and it's nice.  I -- uh, I'm from a home town where there's
