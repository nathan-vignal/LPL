R:  Okay.  
L:  And, uh, actually I'm a +Chinese so I don't go out eat a lot out here.  I don't like the food [LAUGH] here, so I cook a lot at home but, uh, when I was in China most time I go outside +eat at ...  I'm not a big fan of out[?] cook.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  I know.  We usually eat at home too.  We --
L:  Yeah.  But in --
R:  Restaurants.  
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  People round here just -- the food just ain't as good as home cooked meals.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  Uh, but, uh, uh, before, uh, I lived in New Jersey we went to New Y- York City a lot. There -- and there are a lot of what I think are very good restaurant.  Italian restaurant.  The Chinese.  But, right now we move to the middle south.  I really [LAUGH] don't like the food.  They fry too [LAUGH] much.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And the [MN] -- even the vegetable they fry -- frying it, so I don't like this way.  I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- just like the simple [LAUGH] way, you know.  
R:  [MN]  Sometimes we go out and eat ribs.  We've got a good restaurant at Dexter where ...
L:  Yes.
R:  It's called Hickory Hog and we go out there and eat.

L:  Oh, okay.  Okay, but, uh, but my -- I think my husband like the home cooking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Mine does too.  He says --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the restaurants just don't cook like I do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  [MN]  They -- in the Chinese restaurant they put too many salt and MSG but American restaurant, like the Italian one, also put a lot of salt in.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Very salty there.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  I think of my son just like, uh, [LAUGH] McDonald.

L:  Every time ask him where do you want to go.  Just say [LAUGH] McDonald.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Say I want to eat at home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No.  [LAUGH]  He never said he want to stay home eat my cook- -- uh, eat the -- the food that I cook.  The -- he doesn't like the food, you know.  He doesn't like Chinese food.  He like American food.  
R:  [LAUGH]  So I'm fixing to put on a roast right now and have roast tonight for supper.

R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, uh, by the way, if you choose to go outside, uh, what kind of restaurant do you like?  The -- the Italian or the French or something?
R:  Um ...  [LIPSMACK]  Probably Italian.

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's, uh, different.  It's actually it's just different, the sauce.  Uh, but, uh, I think the [inaudible] is almost the same.  Also bakers, uh, use the dough and, uh, put something on it, uh, like, maybe like a Sicily pizza not, uh, on the top but -- but inside, uh ...
R:  Well ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  [MN]  But, uh, uh, do you buy some dough like, uh, the pizza dough or buy the [MN] uh, bread dough just to -- you use the -- a bread machine to made a bread, huh?
R:  Wow.  Do you make lasagna or anything?
L:  Uh, [MN] sometimes.  Not often.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I love egg rolls though.
L:  Oh.  
R:  Egg rolls is one of my favorite.
L:  Oh.

L:  Oh, I know.  
R:  I like that too.  With rice on it.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  That's real good.
L:  Uh, do you like the Mexican restaurant, like, uh, Chili's or something?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, we've -- well, we've got one, uh, Chinese restaurant here and it's pretty good.  It's, uh, some of their stuff ain't too good but, you know, a lot of it is.  Like I like the egg rolls and the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, sesame seed chicken.
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  I really like that.  Put rice on it.  And I like the sweet and sour soups that they have.  And the egg drop soup.  
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  But I don't eat, uh, Chinese food a lot outside, uh ...  I -- I don't think they cook much better than [LAUGH] me.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Probably not.  I bet you really good -- s- stir up some good stuff.  [LAUGH]

L:  And, uh, I use a lot of the tortillas, I think.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Just food, uh, [MN] and anything you want on side.  Uh, on the top, uh, so you can do -- make [MN] like a -- a lot of stuff.  Like Chinese stuff, yeah.
R:  Right.  
L:  Mm.  It's good.  Um, I really do not -- you -- do you think the -- the -- the restaurant -- wh- what kind of restaurant is better?  Uh, you like the single restaurants better than the chain restaurant, right?
R:  Yeah.  I think so.  Usually the chain restaurants, you know, is just the same old thing over and over where --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the single restaurants, you know, they have different stuff and it's stuff that you can't get usually anywhere else.  You know.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  Usually the taste is better.  
L:  Yes.  Uh, I -- I don't know.  Right now I cook a lot at home.  Not eat too much outside, uh ...
R:  We eat out probably -- mostly on the weekends.  
L:  Mm.
R:  Because we're out, like running around and going shopping and stuff and we're not close to home so we usually eat out.  Usually --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- on Saturday nights --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- we eat out.  
L:  Yes, I mean, me too out because, uh, during the week then --
R:  We --
L:  -- my husband -- my husband get home very late.  Uh, I -- so we cannot go outside.  
R:  [MN]
L:  It's too late for my son.
R:  Well, that's the way we are.  My husband works three to eleven shift, and he don't get home 'til eleven o'clock --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- at night.  So --
L:  Wow.  
R:  -- he's used to eating separate at eleven o'clock at night when he comes home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  And we don't usually go to bed until, like, three or four --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in the morning.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  So we're just opposite of -- of everyone else.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Wow.  So you think it's okay, right?  Eat, uh, late, uh, not a big deal?
R:  Nah.  Not for us 'cause we've done it so many years.  
L:  It's --
R:  You know.
L:  I think you better already get used to digest the food in such condition, right?
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  Because a lot people said don't eat too late.  You --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know.  Easy to get, uh, fat and something.  
R:  Well, I've been eating late for, oh, twelve years at least.
L:  Wow.  I think that that is easy to change it to a suitable -- your [LAUGH] demand [inaudible].
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Not like a -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  I don't know, some -- sometimes you always either do exercise than before sleeping, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  There always people sleeping but other time, uh, my husband want to go to have a good sleep he will go outside, uh, uh, jog.  [MN]  He can get very good sleep.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  So you know, I -- old [several inaudible words] said don't exercise but he's [inaudible].  But, you know, he always do the different. [LAUGH] way.  
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN] 
L:  So I don't --
R:  Is your husband American?
L:  No.  Uh, Chinese.
