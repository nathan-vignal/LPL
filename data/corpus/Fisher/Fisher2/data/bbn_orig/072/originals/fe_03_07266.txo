R:  Yeah.  
L:  So then what would be your perfect meal?
R:  My perfect meal?

R:  Yeah, I don't like --
L:  Pretty much [MN] --

R:  Yeah.
L:  See I really like that.  And I really like the sushi [inaudible], just like the raw.
R:  Uh-huh.  With the --

R:  Mm.
L:  -- a little sushi bar at the grocery store so it's not --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- usually very fancy but I guess I would like to go to a -- an actual sushi restaurant.  
R:  Oh, Benny Ha's[?].  
L:  Really?
R:  They don't have a Benny Ha's there?
L:  Uh, I've heard of them.  I've never go to them.  
R:  They are good.
L:  It's a Japanese steakhouse isn't it, or something like that?
R:  Yes.  Oh.  Oh.  They cook everything right in front of you.  Right --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in front of you.  Even make the sushi in front of you.  
L:  That would be really cool.  I would enjoy that.
R:  That is something that you will really enjoy.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I mean, just -- just get the whole menu with the sushi included.  I took my daughter there, what was it?  Uh, around December 'cause she got --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all A's.  Yeah, she got all A's.  So I said name any restaurant you want to go to and she said Benny Ha's.  That's her [inaudible] and we had the whole thing.  From sushi on.  
L:  That sounds wonderful. 
R:  Yes.  It was --
L:  So that would probably be my perfect meal then.
R:  Yeah.  It is really good.
L:  So I guess I really do enjoy -- really enjoy restaurants.
R:  Like they have even -- they have this, uh, the, uh, mushrooms --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that are, I forgot the name of the big black mushrooms?
L:  The Portobello ones?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or the Shiitake?
R:  They stuff it.  
L:  Mm mm.
R:  And they do it right in front of you.  
L:  Do they -- and so like they have all the ingredients just sitting on --
R:  Yeah, all the ingredients.
L:  -- a table or ...?
R:  Yeah.  Have all the ingredients on the table.  You make your order.  Then the chef will come and he would start cooking it and everything in front of you.  Your whole order.
L:  Does it take very long?
R:  'Scuse me?
L:  Does it take very long?
R:  Yeah.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't take long at all.  Because they give you appetizers with the sushi or the stuffed Portobellos.
L:  Okay.
R:  Whatever you want they do that first.  And then, you know, then they go on to the main menu.  
L:  That sounds really good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It's good.  I'm telling you.  I said now that is the best -- best if you really want some good Japanese food.  
L:  Benny Ha's.  
R:  Yes.  
L:  Benny Ha.
R:  That is the perfect place to go to.
L:  What -- what was your favorite restaurant for seafood in New York?
R:  Oh, I used to go to Sammy's.  In City Island.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah, they have everything.  They have the bucket.  The bucket of mushrooms.  
L:  Like, are they fried?
R:  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  No, they --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- are steamed mushrooms with tomato sauce.
L:  Steamed?  [MN]  Really?
R:  Yes.  Now that's good.  
L:  That's sounds like -- 'cause I get -- I get kind of sick of the fried stuff. 
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  You know, that fried stuff isn't good anyway for you because at least, you know, you can't really drink anything cold behind fried foods because that's what clogs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- up your arteries.  
L:  It just kind of sits in your stomach and doesn't digest very well and ...
R:  Yes, it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It does.  It makes you sick and everything for all that grease and stuff being clogged up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- within you.  [MN]  Excuse me.  Belching already.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, yeah.  But I don't -- I don't cook that much fried foods anyway.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, like I said, it's not -- it's not really good.  And, um, all that flour -- the flour is just like, if you're a diabetic, the flour is starch and it just, you know, raises your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sugar up so ...  If anything --
L:  Are you diabetic?
R:  No.  Uh, no, my daughter is.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  My brother is so ...
R:  Yeah.  So if anything just like I -- like she likes fried chicken but I taught her how to like it without flour.  Just to fry it, you know, just put season in and fry it like it is.  And that's it.
L:  That's a really good idea. 
R:  Yeah.  It's really good 'cause you don't have all that flour and stuff on you and all that. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  It tastes really good [several inaudible words].
L:  And the flavor's just right on the chicken.
R:  Yes, it -- right on it.  You don't lose the flavor at all.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You don't lose it.
L:  And if you just pan fry it or ...?
R:  Yeah, you just pan fry it.  That's what you do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You just pan fry it.  Yeah.
L:  Huh.
R:  Pan fry it.  And that does -- matter of fact she just learnt how to cook.  She's up there at my mother's and she's learning how to cook fish and stuff.
L:  How old is she now?
R:  She's fifteen.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  Yeah, she's --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- fifteen years old.  Yeah.  And she likes to cook.  She's learning how to cook.  Uh, 'cause I told her, "Well, you like to eat it you got to learn how to make it".  
L:  Make it.  Yeah.  'Cause it's expensive to have someone else make it for you.
R:  Mhm.  Yes, [inaudible].  'Cause I used to watch her.  As soon as I go in the kitchen her feet would be right up on the table.  I say, "Oh, no, no, no, no.  We gonna do this together.  We definitely --"
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  "-- gonna do this together".  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, yeah.  [MN]  But I love to eat now.  [LAUGH]  I just need to lose --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [inaudible].  [LAUGH]  Every summer I go through this.  I just stop -- I stop eating red meat and fried foods.  
L:  So you -- you do that every summer?
R:  Every summer.  And I -- and by the time October's around I lost about a good -- I lost about a good hundred pounds.  'Cause I need to.  I'm like two fifty.  So I lose between fifty and a hundred pounds.
L:  Every summer?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Wow.  And then you just go back to red meat again over the winter.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, hey, you know, it gives you a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- good schedule. 
R:  Yeah.  Every summer, you know, I just eat like -- first of all, it's too hot in Atlanta.  So really you want to overeat so much?
L:  Yeah.  And even to cook even.  I would imagine.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it's -- it's just too hot to be doing all that.  Sandwich, cottage cheese.  And see I like cottage cheese and yogurt.
L:  Bit of fruit.  Yeah.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, love my fruit.  I eat my fruit, my cottage cheese and the jello.  Sometimes I just get up and get a bowl of cereal.  You know, instead of cooking --
L:  Yeah.  Just something cool --
R:  -- I get a bowl of cereal.
L:  -- and easy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It seems like I, I don't know, it seems to me that during the summer you fill up faster too so I think it -- I'd probably go out to eat more during the winter because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just feel like eating more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  
R:  But, yeah.  In the wintertime a lot of people eat more.  In the summertime they don't eat that much and then --
L:  And you have all the holidays in the winter too.
R:  Yeah.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Too many hol- --
L:  Christmas and New Year.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And Halloween.  
R:  [LAUGH]  On [inaudible] you got the Thanks- Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And you're eating a whole lot in between there.  And the only ones --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you have in the summer was July fourth and Memorial Day and Labor Day.  But you really don't eat that much because it's barbecued.  
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you just have like, you know, fruit salad and potato salad and --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  -- some hamburger or something.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  But, yeah.  Sorry, for chewing in your face.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, yeah.  But it's -- it's all right.  I love food.  [MN]  I can't [inaudible] fast food.
L:  So what e- --
R:  I just -- I just don't like the fast food.  
L:  Yeah, oh, me either.
R:  I don't like to go to McDonalds.  Or none of those other places because afterward
