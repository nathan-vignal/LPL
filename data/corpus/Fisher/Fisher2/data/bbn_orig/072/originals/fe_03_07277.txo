R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Hello, this is Toni.
L:  This is Heath.  I live in Los Angeles.
R:  [NOISE] Ah, I- I'm in Illinois.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I don't know, I guess the topic today is food.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I don't know, I grew up in Hawaii so I kind of like, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Asian and, ah, Hawaiian food myself.  Which, ah, [NOISE] kind of like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kalua pork is one of the ones they have over there that's pretty good.  But, ah --
R:  [NOISE] Ooh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a vegetarian or you just don't like pork?
R:  [NOISE] N- neither- neither.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] Um, I -- I am like probably the world's pickiest eater. [LAUGH]
L:  Gotcha.
R:  I like very little of [NOISE] anything. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And they said if we like to cook or eat out, and I'd rather than cook it than eat it out.
L:  Me too, actually.
R:  'Cause I --
L:  I only eat out maybe four to five --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- times a month.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that's --
L:  Most of the time I cook myself.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that- that's more than we go out.
L:  Okay
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Ah, well, I don't know, I'm a bachelor [NOISE] so ...
R:  Ooh.
L:  [NOISE] It's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] -- more of a lazy thing than anything else, I think.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Although there's a, ah, Cuban restaurant that I really like.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, they -- they have, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, this, you know how Cuban food has got, like, lime in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it and, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- they have all those fried, ah, bananas --
R:  [NOISE] I've never had that.
L:  -- or black beans.  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  But they have -- it's called, ah, Versailles --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- over here [NOISE] and, ah, I love that food.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  S- so occasionally -- it's, like, kind of expensive though.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I'll get that, like, every now and then.
R:  [NOISE] I eat McDonalds. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't eat at McDonalds at all.
R:  [LAUGH] I --
L:  In fact, the only thing I'll eat from McDonalds is, like, ah --
R:  [NOISE] The fries.
L:  -- their fresh french fries.
R:  Yes.  Well, I don't let the kids or anybody eat their meat -- [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because it's all [NOISE] --
L:  I got you.
R:  -- import- --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, imported and nasty.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] [NOISE] Um --
L:  In fact we had a little trick in Hawaii we used to do.  We would, ah, order the fries with no salt --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh. [NOISE]
L:  -- and they gotta cook up like a fresh batch for you.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then you --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause they always dump salt on 'em automatically, so ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  So you get a fresh batch of fries and you put your own salt on it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and then they're not monkeying with 'em.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I worked there for a while and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [NOISE] -- it's horrid. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It is.
L:  I worked at a Taco Belle for, like, two months once, when I was out in Agora.
R:  [NOISE] It's about the same concept. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It's nasty. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [NOISE] you know, and I sell Pampered Chef, so we --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so we do a lot of [NOISE] home cooking, because it's k- -- it's kind of like the theme of the company, you know, bring everybody home to the table kind of thing, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think that's better anyway.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think it's better and it's cheaper. [LAUGH]
L:  Yup, yup.
R:  [NOISE] It's a lot ch- -- a lot cheaper.
L:  Well, see, I'm by --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- myself though, so the problem is with cooking myself, is it's just as easy I think to cook for, like, four or five people --
R:  [NOISE] As it is for one.
L: -- as it is to cook for one.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know? [NOISE]
R:  Well, [NOISE] it depends on what y- you like to eat though.  I mean, th- the dishes that you just mentioned, it's -- it's kind of hard to make a portion for one, you know?
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause most recipes there's like serving size four, serving size ten.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And it's -- and you're sitting there going, "Okay, how much does -- how long's it last in the freezer?"
L:  And not only that, how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- many days in a row do you want to eat it?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, like four or five, yeah okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Sure. [NOISE]
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] [LIPSMACK]  I don't know.  But, no.  [NOISE] M-  -- in most of the restaurants around [NOISE] whe- where we live it's -- I don't trust the health inspector. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like -- 'cause it's -- it's like, you look around, it's like, "Mhm, and how did they pass this test?"  It's like [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I saw this one restaurant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, I wasn't planning on eating there or anything, but they had won a -- a C.  I was like, how on earth --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can you be that bad that you have a C?
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know if they use that, like, rating system over there?
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  But here in California they have, ah -- they have to post --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, a grade --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it can be anywhere from a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- D to a A.
R:  [NOISE] A D is still passing?  That's scary.
L:  [MN] Theoretically, yes.  I've never seen a D.
R:  [NOISE] Ooh.
L:  But --
R:  I'd be scared if you did. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.
R:  You'd run for the door, huh?
L:  But I think a F they actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- close the place down.
R:  [NOISE] O- okay. [LAUGH]
L:  But I actually saw a C.  That's the worst I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ever seen and I didn't even [NOISE] -- I didn't go in there or anything.  I was like, "Wow, check it out, there's a C".
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  "I bet you nobody's going there right now".
R:  [NOISE] Pro- probably not.  That's -- it just sounds gross, you know, 'cause it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- it's like if they score that low, it's like mm.
L:  Yeah, you're thinking in the back --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's probably all kinds of roaches and ...
R:  Or they -- or they like to drop the food on the floor. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And w- [NOISE] -- and with the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- we got, um three kids and the -- the two older ones will just [NOISE] never sit still, you know.  They're just too into it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] And the little one, it's like, [MN] you order him anything [NOISE] he -- he might eat a third of it, so you're pitching half of it, so it's [NOISE] like whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- why bother. [NOISE]
L:  Well, that makes it a little bit more difficult in the restaurants too, I would imagine.
R:  Ah, yes. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Extremely.  It's like, sit down or you run into the john like nineteen hundred times.  It's like, you can't sit down and, like, enjoy it.  It's -- so it's like, why bother? [LAUGH]
L:  Ye- yeah.  You're not there to enjoy the meal.  You're there, like, keeping tabs on the kids. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and running and -- so it's like [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's like all right, hurry up, eat, let's take everything else to go. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And then it's like, "Why did we even do that, hmm?"
L:  Right.
R:  We could have bought, you know, a week of groceries for what it cost to feed [NOISE] the five of us out.  And [NOISE] then we sit down and we tell 'em to, you know, shut up and turn the TV on, and [NOISE] -- yeah, you want to run to the bathroom, go ahead.  It don't bother nobody, cause, you know --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you ain't, you know, running past these people nine hundred [NOISE] times in a row, go- -- you know, bumping 'em or [NOISE] going, "Excuse me, excuse me".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause, you know -- 'cause they never make 'em -- the hallways big enough so you don't get through. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They're always trying to get as much people in the [NOISE] --
R:  They cra- --
L:  -- smallest amount of space as possible.
R:  Yeah, cram 'em in, like, you know, [NOISE] rats.
L:  Sardines.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] [NOISE] And --
L:  So how's the weather out there in, ah, Chicago --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or Illinois?
R:  Um, [NOISE] well, it's [NOISE] sunny and it's pretty nice, except we have these, like, forty mile an hour gusts going. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So [NOISE] it's actually quite a beautiful day. [NOISE]
L:  Ah, cool.
R:  I wouldn't go surfing, but -- in this --
L:  Been --
R:  -- weather.
L:  -- been overcast, ah, here for the last --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- three or four days here in, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what's supposed to be sunny California.  I guess we're going through the June gloom.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] My uncle lives out there in Corona.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] I don't know where that is, never been there.
L:  That east of Finland.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, I don't know where Finland is. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know Los Angeles is right there on that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the edge and, ah --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, Corona's a little -- little bit inland.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah [inaudible]
L:  I'm about two or three miles from the beach.
R:  That sounds far.
L:  So, it's not -- I mean, it's -- it's a long walk if I were to actually walk there --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I still get like, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the ocean breeze, I guess you could say.
R:  Oh.  [NOISE] So how did you get into doing this?
L:  A friend turn me on via email.  He was like, ah -- in fact the header to the thing was like, ah, cigarette money.  I -- unfortunately I smoke cigarettes --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and he was like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know.
R:  [MN]
L:  And he -- and I'm unemployed, I got fired last month.
R:  [MN] Ouch.
L:  So, I mean, it's fine though.  Unemployment actually pays --
R:  It's working, huh? [LAUGH]
L:  -- decent -- decently.  So ...  And I have very few bills being a bachelor and all --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So it's all --
R:  Which is [NOISE] probably for the best at --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- this point.
L:  So I'm going to take a few months off [LAUGH] and I decided to do --
R:  Enjoy the beach, huh?
L:  -- this for, like, extra money.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah?  [MN] Well, my --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- aunt, the one who lives out there by you actually, is the one who [NOISE] sent me the email to do this.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  And I was like, [NOISE] "Sure, why not?  What the heck" you know. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  Well, it's basically about a dollar a minute, so that's not bad.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's like ten bucks for a phone call, you talk for ten minutes and then bam.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And it's like, "Well [MN] okay, I can --"
L:  [NOISE] I mean, if we were -- if it was an hour that'd be sixty bucks an hour, you know.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  That's not too shabby I figure.
R:  I don't think we could talk about food for an hour though. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.  Well, it's not like we've been just talking food either though. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I -- I never usually stick to their subjects.  It's like -- I'm like, "Okay, oops".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We'll talk about their subjects for as long as you can and then it's like, [NOISE] okay, I had to -- instead of list- listening to us breathe for the next six minutes, it's like -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you got talk about something, I mean ...
R:  'Cause they're recording it too, so it's like, "Hmm".  D- --
L:  Well, not only that, you know, it's like in this particular circumstance it's somebody I've never met before.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Y- -- and I'm somebody you've never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- met before.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  So it's like, you know, you're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you do that --
R:  What's the connect- -- you can talk about anything 'cause it's like [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like we'll ever see each other or talk again, you know? [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It's like, you can say, you know, you're got pink or purple hair and I'll be like, "Oh, okay". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Cool. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I don't live in Hollywood.  That's where you find the purple hair people.
R:  [LAUGH] Is it? [NOISE] Okay. [MN]
L:  In, ah -- in Hollywood.
R:  Oh.
L:  But, ah --
R:  Well, you know, it's like that kind of, like, disconnection.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like cool, whatever.  I mean, I talked to this -- oh, he was, like, sixty eight years old from Texas, this guy.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And it was about bad habits.  And I'm sitting there going, "Yeah, I smoke". [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah I do that too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like -- and it's like --
L:  I only have three habits.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah?
L:  And that'd be smoking cigarettes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- alcohol and, ah, actually marijuana.
R:  [NOISE] Ah.
L:  But, I mean, almost --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everybody in southern California --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'd say thirty percent of the people here smoke.
R:  [NOISE] I wish thirty of the peo- -- percent here did.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] It would be a nic- -- much nicer place. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I'd rather be in a room full of people smoking pot than a room full of drunks. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah, totally.
R:  [NOISE] Any day.
L:  But, I mean, I know some people when they get drunk they get really mean.
R:  [NOISE] And nasty.
L:  Y- you know, [NOISE] like --
R:  [NOISE] It is like, yeah, screw you.
L:  Like their testosterone --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- gets amped up by --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- three hundred percent or something.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
