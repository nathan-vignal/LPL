R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hey.  I guess I'm Bob.
L:  I'm Steph.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm in Denver.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in West Virginia, my God.
L:  West Virginia.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.
R:  Oh, yeah?  You think?
L:  I think.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, it's closer to Maryland than, ah, Virginia, so, it's not too deep into the State.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, I'm in a --
R:  So --
L:  -- suburb of Denver.
R:  Yeah.  Well, then restaurants are better there than they are here, I'm sure.
L:  You think -- you think so?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, we have good Mexican food here.
R:  Oh well, I swore Mexican food off when I left California, but I've reneged on that deal a number of times.
L:  Well, in -- it -- where you are in the country really makes a big difference on what kind of Mexican food you get.
R:  Well, this is like the Chinese food out here.  It's all, um, [LIPSMACK] Americanized as much as possible.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah --
L:  So, the question of the day, do you like eating at home, or do you like eating at the restaurant?
R:  Well, the restaurant's definitely more fun.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's entertaining and you don't have to clean up the mess.
L:  That's right.
R:  So ...
L:  I totally agree with that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you do a lot of the cooking at home?
R:  Nope.  Not -- I'm not allowed to touch the -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the stove or the refrigerator half the time, so ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No, I -- [NOISE] I do some, um, ah, but it's -- it is primarily my wife's thing to do.  And once in a while if I can talk the kids into it.
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  If I let 'em go hungry enough.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm not much of a cook.  I mean, I -- I -- we survive, but definitely could, ah, use a few pointers.
R:  Ah, my -- my idea of cooking was, ah, you know, Top Ramen and, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- hot dogs.  So, you know, macaroni and cheese got me through the military, so, you know ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That type of stuff.
L:  Survival food.
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know?
L:  -- that was my college diet --
R:  That --
L:  -- consisted of that.
R:  Yeah, the --
L:  That and --
R:  -- the two burner electric stove and -- and the, ah, hot plate in the room type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Been there, done that. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, that and, ah -- that and pizzas, Domino's pizzas.
R:  Nah, that's okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Us kids from New York, I don't like cardboard for pizza.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's right, you know.  My husband is from Chicago [MN] and, ah, [NOISE] has a real hard time eating pizza here.  And, ah, when we go out there it s- -- [NOISE] it seems silly that they even have Pizza Huts. [NOISE] [MN]
R:  We -- we watched many a Pizza Hut --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- close down from the Island.  Um, they had tried to open 'em up like Seven Eleven's opened up all over the place.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then they had to cut 'em all back because there just wasn't enough business.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Every two blocks you could find a Seven Eleven.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah.
R:  Pizza Hut, they -- if it wasn't for the fact that they serve beer, they would have went out of business a lot quicker.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  I'm sure.
R:  I don't know --
L:  Yeah, why --
R:  -- if you hear an echo.  I hear an echo on this side, I don't know if it's --
L:  [MN] Do you still hear it?  It might have been the two kids that ran through.
R:  No, no, it w- -- it's me.  You know, I -- I can hear it to myself.  It's not bad, but I --
L:  No, I don't hear it on this end.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  I just didn't know if it's -- I ran away from the kids.  I'm down in the basement hiding, so ...
L:  Yeah, they were out selling lemonade here and then they came running, "We have to make more, we have to make more". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's funny --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because my wife does this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she speaks with -- she's had, like, three interviews.  Um, and she said to me, "Oh, you know, you really got to sign up.  They're looking for male voices".
L:  Right.
R:  She had gotten this email.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Last night, ten o'clock at night I sat down and I signed up.  So, here we are --
L:  And you got called --
R:  -- twent- --
L:  -- right away.
R:  Yeah, twenty four hours later.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's like, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's almost scary.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wish job --
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- applications would come through that quick, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we're supposed to be talking about restaurants.
L:  Restaurants, [NOISE] yes.
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  Or eating at home.
R:  No, we have the -- I mean, we're in the very outside edge of the Washington --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- DC hub.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And we do travel into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- towards the city more, towards, um, you know, to do the -- the eating type of thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we do splurge on our restaurant entertainment.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Especially because, you know, with the kids and stuff, and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gives them an a- -- an opportunity to socialize and to actually see --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- more of the real world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- type of thing.  [NOISE] You know, the -- [NOISE] the multitude of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different types of things that are out there.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So, you know, um, we have one trip we take.  It's almost to the edge of DC and, um, in ga- -- um, [MN] yeah, in the Rockville area.  It's, ah, the Cheesecake Factory.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I believe that's a chain, but it's like, you know, the one place that if you wanted to go t- -- out to dinner at -- you know, at any cost --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's the type of place that it is.
L:  Yeah, I've been to those.
R:  Yeah, so it's real nice for us to get out.  And then of course, you know, you have the truck stops all up and down eighty one.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So, [LAUGH] you know, which is a good all you can eat meal and when your children are small you just plop 'em down in a chair and go fill their plate.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And that was always nice.  Mine are teenagers now, so ...
L:  [MN] Yeah, I love the kids eat free stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's the best.
R:  Well, we ran out of that quite a while ago.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  And now my fifteen year old, he's got to find the most expensive thing on the pl- -- on, you know, on the menu.
L:  Of course.
R:  And then my fourteen year old daughter, she's got to compete, but she won't eat any of it, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I sit there and watch a twenty dollar meal go down the tubes.
L:  Yeah, "Ah, I'm not hungry after all".
R:  Yeah, we get -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we eat four pieces of the shrimp and leave everything else going.  It's like, okay.  Ah, we're not happy about it.  Then of course it comes home and sits in the refrigerator for two days and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's the end of that.
L:  Yeah, bye bye.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, or you leave it in the car overnight by accident.
R:  Done that, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Or find it sitting in the back seat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  With the kids.  Yeah.
L:  Smelling wonderful the next day.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK] Well, I just -- I enjoy getting a break from cooking any time I get the chance.  My husband does not go to restaurants. [NOISE]  He absolutely won't.  He -- we go, me and the kids go and bring him something home [NOISE] because he's just -- he likes to be at home.  Doesn't always want to eat something home made, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- doesn't like to do the restaurant thing.  I don't know, [MN] it's kind of different.
R:  Just can't sit there, or just doesn't like the crowds, or ...?
L:  I don't -- I'm not sure exactly what that's all about, but, [NOISE] um, he would rather just sit with his remote and [NOISE] we go out and have a good time at the restaurant and bring him back something. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  See I --
L:  And that's --
R:  I find that entertaining.
L:  [NOISE] It works out -- it works out really good because if he went with us he'd just want to rush us out of there and so we -- we're better off just going, you know, just the three of us, almost four of us. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- [LAUGH]
R:  Almost four of you?
L:  Well, I've g- -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm due today to have a baby.
R:  Congratulations.
L:  Thank you --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- but she's not making her appearance.
R:  Oh, that's all right.  It takes time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My son was almost three weeks overdue.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Please don't say that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, no.
R:  Ten -- ten -- ten pounder.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Ten plus.  Yeah, he was a monster baby.  Didn't want to -- yeah.  He had to be -- he had to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, you know -- ah, he got his notice. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  He was thrown out.
L:  Evicted. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, evicted.  Thank you, that was the word.
L:  [LAUGH] So could gro- -- so he could grow up and eat you out of house and home.
R:  Eat the [several inaudible words].  Right, yeah.  It's either that or it's tear her up.  One of the two, so -- yeah, no, it was, ah [SIGH] yeah, but it's fun, you know.  How old are yours?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, fifteen, eight and, ah, brand new.
R:  Oh really?  Okay.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  So there's a little bit of a -- little bit of a break.
L:  Yeah, a big gap.
R:  Yeah, ours are back to back eighteen months apart.
L:  That's the way I was with my brother.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah -- but these kids they all have the same dad too.  Everybody says, "Oh, do they have the same dad".  Yeah, they have the same dad. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God.  Don't tell me about that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We were -- people were surprised we had running water when we first moved out here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "You have running water in that trailer?"  It's like, ah, yeah.  You know.  "You actually live in that trailer?"  Ah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Needless to say we don't live there anymore. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We bought a home about ten years ago, but, yeah, it was quite a cultural experience then.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And we choice to live here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to raise our children.  And like I said, we're really not out in the, you know, boonies or anything like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Fifteen minutes I can get to a small, but a large enough town and get on a highway and just go anywhere in a matter of hours, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, DC --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is an hour away, so it's not a big deal.
L:  Well we're -- we're -- we're close to a lot of things here too.  The only thing is Denver itself is in the middle of -- you know, there's nothing -- once you leave the metropolitan area, there's nothing for miles and miles north.  There's nothing any direction, you know?  It doesn't matter what direction you go, you have to cover [NOISE] -- and I guess what on the east coast it's so much more populated just from metropolitan area to metropolitan area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Isn't that right?
R:  Yeah we can go from, you know, here to New York -- we can be in New York in ten hours and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, have done a dozen things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- between here and there --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- you know, without even blinking.  So, yeah, we d- -- we -- we tend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to drive down to Florida to visit my mother and, ah, my parents are down that way.
