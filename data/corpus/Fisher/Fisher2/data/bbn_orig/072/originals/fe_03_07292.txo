R:  Hi, my name is Laura.
L:  Hi, my name is Richard.
R:  Oh, hi.  Um, I like eating at home, and sometimes I get tired of my own cooking and I like going out to restaurants.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know that's exactly [LAUGH] how I feel too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I love -- I love cooking.
R:  Me too.
L:  It's one of my passions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Absolutely.  And, uh -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  --  cooking with -- with fresh herbs and all of that stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But there's still nothing like having somebody else cook for you too.
R:  Right.  Especially when you're tired or you've --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- had a rough day and ...
L:  That's exactly it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I have a day like that right now.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Where --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I think we're -- [MN] -- we're not going out but I think we're going to order some Chinese.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  I like Chinese food too.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Because that's -- you know, a type food that you can't make just so like they do it, so ...
L:  No, that's the thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've tried -- I can't --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- even make -- I can't make fried rice anywhere --
R:  Me, [MN].
L:  -- close to it.  
R:  No.  No.
L:  Nothing even close.  
R:  Uh-huh.  I've tried.  I had a girlfriend who could and, um, she came over one day and I thought I had it but it -- mine still wasn't as good as hers.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I had one lady one time that I had met that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Actually, um, I was working on a job.  I did some, uh, con- some construction work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she was -- she was Chinese and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- actually made -- made, um, like an egg -- egg --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- type of fried rice that actually came out almost as close as, uh, the takeout version.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  And it was just absolutely fantastic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, of course, I didn't watch what she was doing so ...
R:  Right.  You got to watch.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And you gotta get all the ingredients that they got too.
L:  Oh, exactly.
R:  And do it just so.
L:  There has to be a secret and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not getting the secret to that.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But, uh, so what type -- what types of food do you like to cook?
R:  Um, I like to cook, like, um, southern foods.  I'm in, um, Atlanta, Georgia.  I grew up in Alabama.  So I love to make, like, uh, macaroni and cheese.  Um, [inaudible] greens, fried chicken.
L:  Mm.
R:  Candy yams and --
L:  You're making --
R:  -- things like that.
L:  -- me hungry.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Making me hungry.  
R:  And I like baking also.  I like, um, my mom always made, um, cakes from scratch.  Uh, most of the time, um, I -- you know, like the holidays, I'll make 'em from scratch.  But I like the box cakes also and there's a secret.  If you put, like, um, c- -- um, sour cream, like eight ounces of sour cream in the, um, [LIPSMACK] cake mix, then it's -- it's real thick, just like as if you've baked it from scratch so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  I'm gonna -- thank you this is -- see this is paying off already.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah.
L:  You get -- you get these little secrets like that.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  And they make all the difference too.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, I -- I -- I actually, I do like to make, like -- like a banana bread from scratch and some --
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  Some of the --
R:  I like to make that too.  Mhm.
L:  Some of the other ones.  But, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't do --
R:  What's your favorite, uh, meal to cook?
L:  Let's see.  Favorite meal to cook.  Um, I actually -- I pre- -- I have this, uh, jerk chicken recipe.
R:  Oh. 
L:  That -- that --
R:  I love that.
L:  Yeah, that I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just love.  I -- I like my [MN] -- some -- uh, most of my food that I play with now is mu- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is -- has got, um, somewhat of a spice to it.  
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And it has to have a little bit of heat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just -- I -- I kind of like that.
R:  Right. 
L:  But, uh, from going to these festivals and stuff and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I live in Pennsylvania so during the summer we have all of these different festivals.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so like [MN] I come back home and then try to imitate the festi- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the festival food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I got stuck on this jerk chicken.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I just -- I just --
R:  So what's the [MN] the -- the, uh, secret to it -- [MN] is it the, uh, spices that you get to, uh, marinade it with?
L:  Well, there's a couple different things.  I've had a dry rub --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- that I got one time and I can't -- I haven't been able to find it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [MN] in any place again.  That was the closest I've ever gotten.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um, I think McCormack actually makes a dry --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a dry rub that is very close.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um, that Lowry's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have, uh, the liquid marinades.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they have a Caribbean jerk that is --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just fantastic.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  And --
R:  I'll have to try that.
L:  Yeah, you put it in for like two or three days.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Lit- literally let it just marinade and marinade --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's --
R:  And you use the boneless chicken breasts?
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Oh, you could use --
R:  I have some of those.  
L:  Yeah, you could use anything but just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you let it sit for at least two days --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it just saturates it and it just --
R:  Mhm. 
L:  It is so wonderful.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Wonderful.
R:  I'll try it.
L:  And -- and let's see, what else [MN]?  I love grilling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that's just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, most guys --
L:  I --
R:  -- do like --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  We just got a new gas grill and my husband loves going out there grilling. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep, I just -- we got a -- a fresh one last year too, so I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just -- I didn't -- and even up here during the winter I -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just pull it up close to the door and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fire it up.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I --
R:  Yeah, I like to barbecue, you know, anytime.  I mean, in this -- and if you have the right stuff you don't have to wait until summer.
L:  Oh, no, defi- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Definitely not.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I -- and -- and besides the fact, just easy clean up.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
L:  I don't have to [inaudible].  I don't have to do 'cause I -- I'm one of those guys that'll -- that has to clean up the dishes almost --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- almost as soon as it's done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause otherwise I won't -- I don't want to look at it.
R:  I know.  
L:  And it' s--
R:  I know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Sound like my husband.  
L:  Yep, no --
R:  He hates a mess.  
L:  No. 
R:  It doesn't bother me as bad but, um, he has to get up and do it right away.  You know, I'll leave it for a little while and, like, I'll, you know, go and do something else.  Then I'll go back to it.  But he likes to just, like, you know, get right to it.  Unless he's really tired.  
L:  Yeah, I used to be like that.  But when I -- like, basically cooking and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then cleaning it as I go along.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So by the time I sit down --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I +actually have a plate of food there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'll be cleaning my last pot.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then I don't have to wo- --
R:  It's a lot better that way.  
L:  It -- I think so too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't have to worry about.  And then when -- when my next meal comes around I got a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- clean kitchen ready to go.
R:  Exactly.  And there's nothing like that.  I tell you 'cause I -- I just cannot stand these dirty kitchens [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  But we don't know what we're eating when we go to a restaurant.  That's the big thing that I don't like about restaurants is that, you know, you don't know what they're doing in the kitchen.
L:  That's --
R:  And they don't all wear the gloves.  I think everyone should wear gloves that serves food.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  That's just --
R:  Especially, you know, out like that.
L:  You just know your own habits at home just what --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just touching things and -- and it just --
R:  Exactly.
L:  You don't even think about it.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's -- that's -- my wife will not -- we -- we don't go out a lot because of that.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  She just --
R:  We don't either.  
L:  Yep, she has a -- a serious phobia of, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of restaurant food.
R:  I know. 
L:  And -- and these --
R:  I know.  
L:  -- days you --
R:  And we've gotten sick, you know, sometimes when we've gone so, you know, it -- it just kinda like, um, you want to go and then sometimes you don't.  
L:  Well, that -- that's true.  Like I said, there's just -- there's times when I just definitely want to go out for dinner --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for some food.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  A -- a good seafood dinner or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that when I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have to -- I don't have to go out and -- and put together ten --
R:  I know.
L:  -- ten different types of seafood.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And buy the -- buy it up.  'Cause that -- that does get to be expensive, you know.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  When you do that.
L:  It's -- it's crazy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unless you get a good a -- a good seafood guy that'll actually just give you a little bit of this and a little bit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of that and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  I actually made last night, uh, uh, a stuffed flounder 'cause I had gotten --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- a -- a real good deal on some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some claw crab meat.
R:  [MN] that sounds good.
L:  A b- a buy one get one free --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at our local market.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh --
R:  I love -- I love those type of [LAUGH] deals.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, it was the best.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it was actually -- it was so good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- they had taken --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the meat off the claw --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and it still looked like it was the meat inside.  They didn't shred it or anything.
R:  Mm.
L:  So you could actually see how -- you know, that it came off in the little pieces.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was just -- I hate half of it right out of the c- -- right out of the little can.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It was that -- it was that good.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah --
L:  But, uh --
R:  -- sounds like it.
L:  -- just a fantastic flounder recipe that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I come up with and that was, uh -- so now that we're -- we were --  we had to talk about cooking that was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm glad --
R:  Yep.
L:  I'm glad this was the subject tonight.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  'Cause you -- you know, you find all kind of ideas and stuff.
L:  Yeah, well, almost everybody can relate to it too.
R:  Mhm.  That's true.  Mhm.
L:  Fantastic.
R:  This -- this was a good topic tonight.
L:  Absolutely.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Is this your first time doing this or ...?
R:  Uh, my second.  
L:  My second is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  My -- this is my first one.  They called me actually and I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the son picked up the phone and didn't know what it was and hung up so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I called in.  I said, "No you can't do that.  I said that's the study".  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  
R:  Oh, yeah, that's still funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  He didn't know what -- yeah, cause, yeah, I mean, it -- it is -- it's -- it's a recording yeah, that calls you so, yeah.
L:  Yep, I didn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I didn't know and I figured I'd just reading my email thing and I just said, okay, well, that's right --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it says you can call in.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah --
L:  So I figured --
R:  -- you can call, uh-huh.
L:  That's --
R:  'Cause I did call and, um, she -- you know, it was like, uh, they'll put you on hold until they find someone so ...  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, this didn't take any time at -- and that's what I did.  I called and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you -- you -- you popped right on the line which was --
R:  Mm. Okay.
L:  -- very nice.
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We must've been thinking about it at the same time.  Oh, your son had hung up and you called 'em back.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep.  Actually I had to go out.  They sent me out to the store to do -- do some other errands.  I came back and I said, " [MN] Man, it's dinnertime, what are we doing?"
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And I said, "No, I gotta make this phone call".  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we'll just see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what -- see what was going on with that.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause they'll send you a check for ten dollars.
L:  Now that's just -- that's excellent.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know why they don't wait until they get them all -- you know, all the talks you've done and d- do it at once but they -- they just send 'em, you know, at random.  Um --
L:  So that's how it actually works.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You just -- you talk one time and they just send you one?
R:  Right.  
L:  Wow.
R:  And then you talk again, then they send you another one.
L:  That's -- that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can live with that.
R:  Pretty neat, I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  It is.  Very neat.  Did you find this at the study -- like out on the internet?
R:  In the internet, yeah.  
L:  Yeah?
R:  At, um, the website called fat wallet.  Do you ever go there?
L:  What's it called?
R:  It's called fat wallet.
L:  Fat wallet.  No.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm gonna --
R:  Yeah, it's neat.  You should go there.
L:  I'm gonna have to do it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I found it -- found it on J Diller.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's, um, it's, uh, a freebie site.
R:  Right.  There -- uh, fat wallet is -- is -- is also.  But then they have, like, lots of forums and different type things, you know.  You just kind a gotta go in and -- and finagle around but it's a excellent site.
L:  I actually have heard of it but I hadn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I hadn't gone on it.  [several inaudible words] when -- when this done I think I'll go out and check it out but ...
R:  Me too.  And what's yours called, J Dealer?
L:  J Diller.  D.I.L.L.A.R. I think.  Or E.R.  I'm not sure.  But it's a -- it's -- it [MN] there's all kinds of links and it literally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has like fifty thousand different -- it's the -- one of the best sites I've seen for that.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  It's just absolutely fantastic. 
R:  There's so many of, um, uh, good ones out there with free stuff, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  You just gotta --
L:  [MN]  W- well, that -- 
R:  -- know the ones to go to.  
L:  [LAUGH]  That's what I like.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just love -- I love it.  
R:  I love it too.
L:  Well, actually, I was on one that, uh, it's so funny I just got, uh, a sample of liquid -- apple flavored liquid smoke.
R:  Oh, okay.  That --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sounds neat.  
L:  Yeah, to try.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I just --
R:  Yeah, I went on, um, line -- I think it was fat wallet site and I got, um, some country bob.  Some type of sauce.
L:  Oh, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just did -- I heard the country bob thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think one of these guys had a, uh, uh, it was -- and I guess dry rubs.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm not sure if they -- they had a dry rub sample thing.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was the same thing.  So I -- I got on all these different food ones just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to -- just to [LAUGH] see what else is out there.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And taste some of that.
R:  Yeah, I love getting stuff like that.  I mean, it's like, oh, man.  I got this, I didn't even have to pay for it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, yeah, beside the fact for me I'm -- I'm still like a little kid.  I'm forty five --
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.
L:  -- but -- but I'm like a little kid because it's Christmas every day --
R:  I know.
L:  -- in the mail.
R:  In the mail.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  You know, what- whatever it is.  +Whether --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, when we hang up I'm gonna go and, uh, online and -- and see, you know, what's out there.  'Cause I mean that is just like, I don't know how I ever lived without the internet.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, you know what?  And the thing is I've only been on for about a year.
R:  Oh, I've been on --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for about three so ...
L:  Yeah, if -- if --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I --I was gonna say, if that.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I got a new Dell right around Christmas.
R:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.
L:  And so I just -- I [LAUGH] basically live on it.  I get yelled at --
R:  I know.
L:  -- all the time.
R:  I know.
