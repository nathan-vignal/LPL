L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen. 
R:  Hi, I'm Shirley.  
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm good thank you.  I guess we're supposed to talk about friends. 
R:  Yes.  
L:  Do you want to start?
R:  Well, I have few very good friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.  I don't know how -- what to say.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I have a lot of -- I have, um, a couple of very, very, very close friends and some, you know, good friends, and then I have a lot of acquaintances just from everything that I do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you know, I wouldn't call everybody friends but I get along with everybody that I, you know, that I meet and that I see ev- -- on a daily basis. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, but I do have some -- some very, very close friends that, you know, I speak to everyday and, you know, do things with all the time but, uh, I have a lot of different friends because of different things that I've -- outside that I'm involved in.  
R:  Well, I have a few very close friends but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a l- lot of acquaintances that I would speak to if I saw, but I wouldn't deem them really friends.  
L:  Right.
R:  You understand that I'm saying?
L:  I got you there.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They're just acquaintances and that you see them everyday so ...  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't even know what the rest of the question was.
R:  What was the question?
L:  Um ...
R:  Um ...
L:  I guess we talk about, uh, if we're the kind of person who -- oh, we should talk about our best friends.  That's what it said.
R:  Oh, our best friends?  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Okay.  That'd be hard for me to choose.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, our best friend.  Well, I'd have to start with Linda.  
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How -- how did you meet her?
R:  Uh, actually I met her when she started dating my husband's uncle.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And both of our -- both of us are disabled to a point.
L:  Right.
R:  And we started -- she can't see and I can't walk.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  So we started out helping each other.  Um, helping clean house, stuff of that nature.
L:  Right.
R:  Doing errands for each other.  Now any little thing pops up, either -- either she can do it or I can do it or we both can do it together.
L:  Right.  Well that's good.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's a good way to become best friends.
R:  Uh, when we first met we -- oh, shoot we did -- we have done a little bit of everything.  I helped to build her barn, her block barn.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Uh, yeah, she -- we had to put this -- all this paint, it had concrete in it.  
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, man.  You wouldn't believe how heavy that stuff [LAUGH] was?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  We ha- we have basically done a little bit of everything together.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  So if I ever need anything she's there for me and she needs anything I'm there for her.  So ...
L:  Guess that's what best friends are all about.  
R:  Yeah.  That's what -- that's what makes 'em count as a best friend.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, I have a best friend from growing up that I still speak to all the time.  And, you know, we don't live near each other but we're like the co- -- the best friends.  We're like you can -- you call about everything and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you share everything together but you just aren't around each other.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then I have a best friend who, um, who I met, um -- my husband's best friend from college.  We -- the three of us went to school together. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then his wi- -- my -- my husband's best friend's wife she didn't go to school with us but we just became friends over the years.  And then just became best friends.  Now we live in the same town and we have, um, [MN] you know, old -- my oldest son is her son's age so we do a lot of things together.  We have a lot of things in common and we've just become best friends and, you know, I don't have to speak to her everyday but I know that if I need her or like -- like we just need to do something or I need to get out of the house.  Like we always have each other to, like, you know, just run to a movie.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or go to dinner or a couple of drinks.  You know, just something to, you know, get our mind off everything.  You know, she's just that kind of friend, you know.  Um, I didn't grow up with her.  I've only known her for, um, [LIPSMACK] I would say, uh, ten or eleven years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That we've, you know, really become best friends and it's funny because it's -- my husband's best -- you know, best friend's wife.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Instead of, you know, somebody that, you know, I've -- that I knew on my own.  So it's, you know, it's nice to have -- have someone like that who when you need to do something or need to talk to somebody you always have them there.
R:  Oh, yes.  I think with my -- [several inaudible words] needed Linda with my baby.  Well, she's twelve now.
L:  Right.
R:  But she started cutting her teeth, oh, man, she was awake constantly.
L:  Right.
R:  And I pick up the phone and I call her and say come get her.  Come get her, I'm going crazy.  Come get her.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Isn't that nice?
R:  Uh, yes it is.  
L:  That's a best friend.
R:  She comes in and takes this screaming young 'un home with her.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's so funny.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Perhaps[?] maybe I should try that one.  Now -- but, yes, it's nice because we live in the same town and if I needed to run somewhere I always have her to be able to run over, you know, to watch my kids or, you know, I can drop the kids off there in like a bind.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- somewhere you're not afraid to call.  
R:  Oh, I know --
L:  For anything.
R:  -- what you mean.  Mhm.
L:  So ...  That's, you know.  But then you have other friends that you can count on for other things.  You know, to go out with every once in a while just to get, you know, a day away or -- or a night away or something and some who, uh, you know, you just see every once in a while and, you know, you're friendly.  
R:  Well, let's see.  You've -- I've got a category of friends that I been friends with since, oh, shoot I was probably in diapers. 
L:  Right.  
R:  Went through school with 'em and so forth.  But we don't see each other every day.
L:  Right.
R:  We live in different towns now.  
L:  Right.
R:  But I can pick up the phone and I call and it was just like we spoke yesterday.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
R:  It's like, "How've you been?"  And then we get all the little new stuff out of the way.  You know, she -- it -- it just ...  I -- I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- don't know how to explain it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I -- I understand it because I have a couple of friends that don't live in the area either but it's like you always know that, you know, you're thinking of them and then, you know, you just call up to catch up for a minute and, you know, no- nothing's new.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's like, "Hi, what's new?"  "Nothing".  "I haven't spoken to you in two months [MN] something has to be new".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH]  So it's kind of funny.  
R:  Oh.  I- it's funny when they can pick up the phone, they just know that they -- you need 'em to call you and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're really down and they call you.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you're down.
L:  Yes.
R:  And it's like you got this psychic co- connection. 
L:  Exactly.  Like where you -- somebody calls you and like I was just thinking about calling you.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  You know, like friends like that.  It's just, you know, sometimes when -- when you mean to call and, like, all of a sudden you get sidetracked by a hundred million things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then they call.  And that's when it "God, I was just thinking about calling you.  But I haven't had a chance to pick up the phone".  You know with kids it's just like I -- I don't feel like I speak to anybody anymore.  But because all my friends, you know, were all, you know, fairly new parents --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we -- we all, um, we all understand.  You know.  Where -- where it's good to, you know, have those friends where I met when my older son was born.  He's three and a half.  And I have like those friends who've become some of my closest friends.  Because we went through every single thing together.
R:  Yeah, I've got one that I went through, uh, Lamaze class with and ...
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And it's like all of a sudden, like, you have something so in common with that person you find yourself calling them all the time, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is so and so doing this too?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is so and so going through this because I'm doing this?  And it's nice to know that somebody else is going through the same thing you're going through.  
R:  Yes, it is.  
L:  So that's -- that's another good thing about friends.  With a lot of, you know, depending on which friend it is with the same interests it's, you know, you know someone's going through the exact same thing, you know, you're going th- through.  And it's always good to have someone like that.  It's also good to have friends that have no idea what you're going through.  Because, you know, you have the -- some of those friends that -- that know and are like, "Oh, yeah, I -- I know that.  I -- same thing [MN] happened to me" and sometimes that gets annoying.  
R:  Yes, that can be.  
L:  You know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  When you can't just complain about something.  
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  Because they've been through it too.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, I know what that is.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  Linda can be annoying in that way.  
L:  Right.  
R:  She goes. "But my eye's been bleeding.  Everytime I bend over".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  She's diabetic.  
L:  She what?
R:  She's diabetic.  
L:  Oh, oh, oh.
R:  And she's losing her eyesight.  Her eyes bleed.  
L:  Oh, is that why she's blind?
R:  Yeah, she's going blind.
L:  From diabetes?  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm sitting here and I'm -- I'm walking around with a broken hip and she's going "But my eye bleeds".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, you have a broken hip?
R:  Yes.  I have a bone di- -- [MN] bone disease.  My, uh, bones are, um, the best way to describe it is like an Alka Seltzer.  You drop it in water and it fizzes away.
L:  Right.
R:  That's what my bones are doing.  
L:  Oh.  So you --
R:  And I'm thirty five.  
L:  Really?  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you can't replace it?
R:  Well, they told me I was too young because bones, uh, a bone replacement generally takes, uh, it only lasts ten to twelve years.  
L:  Oh. 
R:  And, uh, you can only have it done twice
