R:  Charlene.
L:  Hi, Charlene.  It's Bob.
R:  Hi, Bob.  
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, and you?
L:  All right.  Second one for today.  
R:  It's actually my first.  This is my first time.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.  Well, I just signed up.  My wife does this.  And she had gotten a notice that said that they needed male voices for this.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And had me sign up for it and I thought, "Okay".  And two in a row.  Two within one day.  
R:  Wow, so you can --
L:  But --
R:  -- do as many you want in a day?
L:  [MN]  I guess.  I don't know.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, I don't know.  So I already spoke about going out and eating dinner so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I guess they'll have to listen to me all over again.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  Well, it'll be new for me so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, um, I guess [MN] the -- the point of the matter for us is that being [MN] sort of out of any major cities, um, you know, we have to, sort of, take like an hour drive to be into a city to get any real food but, um, you know ...  Actually, I think going out to dinner is pretty good because then you don't have any mess to clean up and ...
R:  That part I love.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, the -- the kids are happy and, you know.  Locally we can go and hit the, um, all [LIPSMACK] you can eat, you know, food bars and, uh, you know, plop the kids down and they're done.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Well, I definitely like it because [COUGH] -- like going out because I have twin three year olds, um, so I definitely don't have to worry about cook -- coming home and cooking and refereeing their disagreements while I'm trying to cook.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and still maintaining my sanity during the same time so ...  Um, I also can -- since they have different ta- -- they're three, so different tastes, different opinions on what they want, when they want it.  Um, I don't have to worry about cooking five different things to satisfy their needs.  Um, I can just order something off the menu and be done with it.  Don't have to clean up, um, all of that stuff so that -- that's really a benefit for me.
L:  Oh, what you have to look forward to is, like, my, um, my fifteen year old he's [COUGH] you know, a big growing boy and the most expensive thing on the -- on the menu he wants.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH]  And his thirteen year old sister [COUGH] 'scuse me, is right there behind him ordering just about the same thing.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And, uh, the problem is not so much that him ordering what he wants, it's her ordering what she wants, eats half -- a couple of bites and then just says that she's done.  And, uh, that's -- that's been our newest --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- complaint with her.  Is that, you know, but es- -- and especially, like I say, i- if we go somewhere to go out to eat [COUGH] you know, we drive towards, uh, um -- D.C. is about an hour away from us.  I'm actually in eastern panhandle in West Virginia.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, uh, we're transplants from -- from New York, out in Long Island. 
R:  Really?  That's where my husband's from.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  What part?
L:  Uh, Suffolk County.  
R:  Oh, okay.  He's from Freeport.  
L:  Oh, I was --
R:  So I guess that's Nassau[?] county?
L:  I was born in Freeport.  
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, I was.  
R:  Wow.
L:  My -- my grandfather rode on the train out to Konedison[?] every single day.  My -- matter of fact, my uncle, uh, from Merrick[?] and, uh, Freeport, and I was raised in Central Islip.  Which is --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- down the train route.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  
L:  But it's a small world.
R:  Small world.
L:  That's right.  
R:  Well, we're actually [MN], uh, very close to DC.  We're outside of, um, D.C..  We're in Fort Washington, Maryland.
L:  Okay.
R:  So we're just over the Wilson Bridge.  So we kind of have the benefit of -- of being close enough yet far enough --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- um, from the city so it's not a long --
L:  Well, if you go out -- if you go out two seventy.
R:  No, I'm at --
L:  Well, I'm saying if you go out two seventy --
R:  Yeah, I used to work out -- I used to --
L:  -- towards, uh --
R:  -- work out that way.
L:  Yeah.  We're out by Heggers[?] Town.  I -- I'm --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm actually --
R:  [MN]  Yeah.
L:  -- in West Virginia but -- so I mean we have Virginia.  We can go down to Winchester.  We can go up to Heggers Town.  Or we can head in towards Frederick.  Actually my wife is really into, um, um, she does these, uh, shopping things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, oh, what do they call 'em?  But we go in to, uh, Gaithersburg[?] and in towards, um, [LIPSMACK] Rockville.  And there's a cheesecake factory.
R:  Yes, I love it.
L:  And, uh, so we went there for Mother's Day.
R:  The one at White Flint[?] Mall.
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  Yes.  
L:  And, uh, she did -- she -- she has now done that place two times for shops where she goes in and she writes up reports about 'em and everything else.
R:  Yes, I just started that as well.  Oh, my God.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] you know, so [MN] yeah.  I mean, we -- we do trip around.  We -- that's our -- that's our, you know, night out type of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's what -- that's what we do.  And, uh, sort of, yeah, especially with the kids at their age and stuff, you know.  They're -- but they've been eating in good restaurants all their lives.  I mean, you know, I don't -- I don't have a problem going out and spending, you know, fifty dollars here or there.
R:  Right.
L:  With the four --
R:  You don't mind going to Copelands or --
L:  [MN]  No.  
R:  -- cheesecake factory.
L:  I mean, but then again I can drag 'em out to Flying Jays and plop 'em down and, you know, in a truck stop, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And so I mean, you know, that's -- that's half of why we like to go into the city because being out here, up on the mountain, I mean, it's pretty.  It's our place.  Nobody's really around us but there's not a lot of [MN] -- you know, the people out here are kind of real set in their ways.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, so it gives them a little bit more, uh, culture.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's -- that's our big thing and, you know, we can take 'em, like I said, we -- we can take 'em into, you know, [MN] the finer restaurants that are local, take 'em into D.C. and go into places, um, you know, we -- we go in towards the capital and all that type of stuff quite a bit.  And, uh, you know, [MN] you don't have to be too concerned about how they're going to behave.  It's like little mountain people type of thing.  
R:  Right.
L:  M- my son was born in New York but my daughter's born out here and -- and pretty much they both been raised doing that type of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh --
R:  I guess when mine get to the -- that age, um, but right now you know it's kind a hard to take a three year -- two three year olds [LAUGH] out in that kind of environment because --
L:  [MN]  +No.
R:  -- to get them to sit that long, number one, is going to be a chore.
L:  But that's all the fun of it.  It's when the old people are sitting there looking at you and going --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- " [MN].  Don't those people know not to have children?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, we've heard that and, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  All the fun of it though.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, the lady I spoke to earlier she's -- she's got two young children.  No, a fifteen and eight year old and one on the way.
R:  Whoa.
L:  And sh- -- they were up in, um, +Colorado -- Colorado out at Denver and, uh, you know, they have the same type of thing.  They -- [MN] where you go to eat, once you're out of that city [MN] that's the end of it.  And it's like, you know, we can go from D.C. to Baltimore down to the northern shore, you know.  It's like [MN] you know, we have such a variety --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- in a local area of -- of things to do and places to eat and, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Heck, we even got a, uh, what's the amusement park right out there?  They just --
R:  Six Flags?
L:  Yeah.  Kings -- Kings Dominion?
R:  Out here?
L:  Yeah.  What's in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  My son just went to one up near Baltimore.
R:  Yeah, it's probably Six Flags.
L:  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  I don't get to do that.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I get to go to Hershey[?] Park and that's about the best I get.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] deal.  But, [MN] you know.
R:  How often do you get to go out?
L:  [MN]  Anywhere between, you know, two -- two times a week, well, let's say average, you know.  If it i- -- [MN] between my work schedule and my wife just went back to work.  She'd been at home with the kids for about fifteen years --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and she just went back to work.  So it's like now we don't have that much time.  I work third shift.  She's on the first shift.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's like -- so we're -- she just came in the door type of thing and three or four hours later I'm going out. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So when we do have the weekends together and stuff we try to, you know, if it isn't a quiet -- you know, if it isn't Denny's or something like that, you know, right up the -- the ladder we -- we try to do something special.
R:  Yeah.
L:  As much as we can.  Now -- now that the kids are at their age, we're saying, "Hey guys, make yourself some dinner, we're going out".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "See you later".  We just went out to a bar.  A friend of mine was playing in a band and had dinner at this, like, uh, bar and grill type of thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, [MN] this has gotta be like the first time that my wife and I have literally been in a nightclub type situation for, now [MN] fifteen years maybe.  Something like that.
R:  Wow.
L:  Type of thing.  So, yeah, it's -- we're -- we're sort of reaching that point where we're back into finding, um, a little bit more freedom.  
R:  I certainly envy you.  
L:  Well, we don't --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- have any relatives here.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  See my family's down in Florida.  Her's are up in New York.  And it's not like we can just drop the kids off at Grandma
