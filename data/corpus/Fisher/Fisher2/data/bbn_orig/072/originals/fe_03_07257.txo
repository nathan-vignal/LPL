L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
L:  Hi, I'm Brooke.  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  How's it going, Brooke?
L:  Oh, good.  Good.  Um, do you want to go fi- first?  [MN]
R:  Um, yeah, I guess so.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
R:  I haven't done this before but I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- guess so.  Let's see.  Which do I like eating better?  At home or at a restaurant?  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  At home probably means I'm cooking.  So probably at a restaurant.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Um, I -- well, I like both.  I'm actually going to culinary school next year so that's why I heard this topic I was [MN] I can talk about this for ten minutes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, I, yeah, I [MN] love cooking.  I love cooking.  But I love going out as [LAUGH] well, you know.  I love to go and see what's, you know, what new meals and see just, um, different recipes and see what, you know, I like also I just, uh, um, went to school for hotel and restaurant management.  So I love just going to the restaurants and experiencing, you know, the atmosphere and everything.  But I like to cook.  I live with a group of ten and I like -- I'm cooking a meal for them tonight.  And I like preparing, like, catering parties and everything.  
R:  Oh, wow.  Good for you.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I have like this big passion for [LAUGH] food.  And I'm going to culinary school next year.  My parents are like you do not need to do this.  You're going to be three hundred [LAUGH] pounds by the time, you know, if you do this as your career.  And [MN] sadly enough, 'cause I like -- I work in a restaurant now and I pick at everything, you [LAUGH] know.  I'm like so bad with that.  But I just love it.  And I have such a passion for it.  I'm like, you know, I -- I'll have willpower.
R:  What's your -- what's your favorite kind of food?
L:  Um ...
R:  I mean, if you -- I'm just a little curious because you, you know, 'cause you're in the industry --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you want to be in the industry even more than you are now.  So, I mean, if you had to pick something ...
L:  Well, my favorite kind of food is Japanese.  But that's not what I'll be [LAUGH] making probably.  I w- --
R:  Japanese, like sushi or like to cook stuff?
L:  Yeah, I like sushi.  I like the hibachi grill and, you know, where they cook in front of you and all that.  That's definitely my favorite kind of restaurant or my favorite food.  But my, um, but that's not probably what I'll be cooking.  You know, I'd ideally like to be in a five star restaurant but, um, not -- it wouldn't be Japanese.  [LAUGH]  You know.  
R:  Yeah, I don't know --
L:  What --
R:  -- of many five star restaurants.
L:  Or like four star -- like, you know, like --
R:  No, no, no.  That are Japanese.  I mean --
L:  Oh, oh, okay.
R:  -- there are -- there are -- there are a couple --
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
R:  -- in New York but not many others.  [MN]  Probably a couple in San Francisco.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you from?  Where are you living?
R:  I live in New York.
L:  Oh, yeah?  I was there this weekend. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Do you live in Manhattan?
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh.  Um --
R:  And there's tons of restaurants and they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all serve tons of food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I went to, um, Tower this weekend.
R:  Oh, perfect.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, Tower's great.
L:  Which is so cool.  Yeah.  Such a fun place.  My sister lives there.  And so she like -- she has that Zagats book and everytime, like, my mom comes up she's like, "There's something different I want to try and I just haven't been able to afford it".  So we go out to -- I mean, she -- everytime she goes on a date, finds a different restaurant to go [LAUGH] to.  I love that.
R:  Oh, right now, you might want to just remind your sister that, um, in New York they're having this thing where it's called, like, I forget what's it called.  It's something where basically if she buys, um, Time Out or the Village Voice she can -- there's a list of restaurants that are serving like three to five course meals for twenty dollars and three cents.  
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Two thousand and three.
L:  For how long is this going on?
R:  Um, it's like throughout the month or into the beginning -- into the middle of next month, something like that.  It happens every year.  And the price is --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- the price is the year.  So this year it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- two thousand and three.  So two dollars and three cents.
L:  Oh, cool.  And it's in that Time Out magazine?
R:  It's in Time Out or she can get it in the Village Voice.  And it's some great restaurants.  Tower's on there.  
L:  Oh, my God.  Wish we would a known [LAUGH] that this weekend.  
R:  Right.
L:  They, um, well have you heard of the restaurant, Cite, is that what it is.  I think C.I.T.E.  
R:  Uh, I haven't, I don't know.  I don't think so.
L:  Somebody was just telling me about this last night because we're planning a trip to go up in, um, in July and she was saying it's like sixty dollars a person but you -- it's like a five course meal and all you can drink.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So we're like, well, for New York that [LAUGH] was, for us, it would also equal out, you know.  Sixty dollars for drinks too.  And, uh, she wasn't sure where it was but she was saying -- she's from New Jersey and her brother works in the city and he went up there.  I don't know if you knew anything about it.
R:  Sixty dollars?  If that includes, well, it must -- they must tell you -- they must have, you know, you can only drink -- be so many drinks or something.
L:  Well, she said that he said that they kept like refilling -- refilling the wine, like the whole time.  And it's just they keep coming.  I don't know.  We're -- we're gonna check it out but ...
R:  Oh, wow, I might have to --
L:  So ...
R:  I might have to look that one up.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  For sixty dollars in New York?
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  Look, it's C.I.T.E.
R:  I'm like [MN] a simple martini in New York is like --
L:  I know.
R:  -- twelve, fourteen dollars.
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  Where do you live in New York?
R:  I'm on the upper west side.  
L:  What -- what -- I don't know.  Which street is it?
R:  [MN]  Um, Eighty Sixth and Riverside. 
L:  Oh, yeah.  That -- my sister lives on Thirty Ninth between First and Second, the Riverside.
R:  Okay.  So she's on the east side.  I'm on the other side.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm on the other side of the park.  
L:  Okay. 
R:  [MN]  But --
L:  Yeah, I love New York.  I -- we -- I just got back yesterday [LAUGH] actually.  It's funny.
R:  Where are you now?
L:  Um, I'm in State College, Pennsylvania.  I go to Penn State.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, and I'm moving up to, um, to go to school next year I'm moving to Charleston, South Carolina.  And so --
R:  Oh, that'll be different.
L:  Yeah, and there's tons of restaurants there [LAUGH] too, so ...  
R:  There's --
L:  I'm like real excited about that.
R:  There's -- there's this -- this one that was pretty good there.  What was it called?  Um, Carolines?
L:  Carolyns?
R:  [MN]  Carolines.  
L:  Oh.
R:  It's right downtown, South Carolina.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Downtown Charleston.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  Um ...
L:  Okay, I'll -- I'll definitely [LAUGH] look it up.  Or find it.
R:  They did like a bunch of different types of foods and stuff like that.  Um, know another place, it was right around the corner from there.  It was a little Italian place.  It [MN] upstairs.  It was actually really, really good.  Um ...
L:  I'm sure I'll find out.
R:  I don't remember the name of it.
L:  And also because the guy I'm moving down with, just a friend, but he's, um, he like got this great job.  I'm still gonna be in school and so -- and he's gonna have to, like, we're not gonna be able to go out every night and party so we'll like, "We'll go out to every [LAUGH] restaurant".  You know.  Go to dinner, and so we're real excited about that.  And I'm like so excited.  Everything I learn, you know, I'm gonna want to come home and try to cook it [LAUGH] for him, you know.  And have little parties.  So, I'm real --
R:  Well, you'll be able to do that in South Carolina.
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I know.  Good seafood [MN] ...  
R:  You'll definitely be able to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do that there.  Although, I mean, cost of living and stuff is really cheap there so ...
L:  I know.  It's so cheap.  It's -- the apartments are like --
R:  I mean, even restaurants and stuff like that.  Restaurant and drinks and stuff like that, they're a lot cheaper.  Well, every place is cheaper than New York.
L:  Than New York.  Yeah.  
R:  But ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You can't compare anything to New York prices.  My God.  But, um, yes, the -- our rent's gonna be like three fifty each for a big townhouse.  I mean --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- not anything the size of a -- a New York [LAUGH] apartment, you [LAUGH] know.  It's like -- like decent size houses.  And a pool out front and everything.  And a grill, maybe, so we [LAUGH] can cook [LAUGH] outside.  Um ...
R:  Oh, that sounds great.
L:  I know.  I'm -- I'm getting real excited about it.
R:  Do you know where you're gonna be in South Carolina?
L:  Um, well I'm gonna be in Charleston.  I'm gonna be in North Charleston.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But my school -- my -- the culinary school's right downtown Charleston.  Like five minutes from the beach, right from the main street on, I think it's Bay Street.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I know North Charleston fairly well.
L:  Do you?  I've never been up to the North Charleston area.  Uh, we haven't even looked for -- uh, we've looked into houses but not gone there and so, um, but that's like the average, what I said.  But I've been downtown Charleston.  And it's great.  And I've -- I'm going for a year for the school but I feel like I'm gonna stay there and work since -- since there's so many restaurants there.  
R:  Oh, yes. You'll be fine.
L:  I know.  And I think I'm gonna love it.  [LAUGH] Once I get there I'm not gonna want to leave.  
R:  You'll be fine.  The beach is, you know, the beach is pretty cool there.  There were -- there's a fair amount of restaurants on the beach.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, a lot of them play music and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have a little outdoor bands during the summer and stuff.  
L:  Oh, I'm getting real excited.  Um, what's your --
R:  Yeah, so that's --
L:  -- favorite kind of food?
R:  That should be cool.  Um, [LIPSMACK] my favorite food is probably -- it's probably Thai food.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I went to --
L:  I like --
R:  -- Thailand a few years ago.  I went and travelled all over South East Asia but I --
L:  I want to do that.
R:  -- absolutely loved the food in Thailand.  And there's a couple places in the city that I think do an incredible job.
L:  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  I had -- [MN] I can't -- I will never remember the name of the restaurant.  I, like, three years ago, four years ago, I went to a really good Thai restaurant and -- in New York, and I -- I'll never remember.  I think it was down in, um, down in, like, Greenwich Village area.  Somewhere around there.  But I don't -- or maybe in the [inaudible] area.
R:  Oh, I wonder what it was called.
L:  But I can't [MN] -- I -- I will never remember.  [LAUGH]  Not even try to.  My sister take -- we go out and she'll order for us.  She's like, "Uh, I'm just gonna order.  We're all gonna share" in these [LAUGH] restaurants and we just like let her take over.  And then that's what I do when I'm out with my friends.  But when I'm with her she's, like, a little bit more demanding so I [LAUGH] let her take over.  And she like, will get [inaudible] when we-- when we go to Tower she'll like order, I guess, we get like, you know, we make the steak on the little rock, where you cook it yourself.  And just like all sorts of fun things.  And she's like -- and then we'll like suggest one thing.  "Oh, it's not very good here.  Let's get this".  [LAUGH]  How 'bout --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the, um, have you ever gotten the desserts at Tower?
R:  No.  I -- I'll -- I've only been there a couple of times because the line is incredible sometimes.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  That's what I walked in there -- the other day we were waiting.  I go, " [MN] I wish this could be a rest- my restaurant that I own would be like ..." because I always say I want to own a restaurant one day.  I'm like, "I wish it could be as successful as this place".  I think it's like always busy.  It's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I usually go -- well, in New York, um, people tend to go out more -- the locals tend to go out more during the week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I usually -- when I've gone I've gone during the week and it's, you still wait in
