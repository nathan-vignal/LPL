L:  Hello.  My name's Donna.
R:  Hello.  My name's Marlene.  How are you?
L:  Fine.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  Where are you from?
L:  Um, Melbourne, Florida. 
R:  Oh, my gracious.  
L:  And you?
R:  I'm, uh, uh, [MN] Charlotte, North [LAUGH] Carolina.  Yeah, that's pretty far away.  I bet it's beautiful there?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Well, good.  I guess we're supposed to talk about food right.  
L:  Oh, that's not a hard topic to talk about.  
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ain't that the truth. 
L:  I love [LAUGH] food.  
R:  Well, I do too.  Um, I'm on a low carb thing so as far as eating out goes, um, when you're eating out with low carbs it's like, um, okay, g- -- just take me where I can have the meats and the vegetables and the greens.  But forget the pastas and things like that.  
L:  And the potatoes and the bread. [inaudible].
R:  The potato -- yeah.  Yeah.  But even though I love that, uh, and [SIGH] above all restaurants, um, I have -- the -- the Olive Garden, believe it or not has got some great pasta and of course their salads and -- and breads are wonderful.  
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  But, you know, that's like a chain thing.  It's not, of course not, it's my fav- my husband's favorite but, you know, he --
L:  So ...
R:  -- loves pasta, for which he can eat and I can't.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  So you're probably better off when you go out to eat to eat someplace that has a salad bar?
R:  Yeah.  See, it's -- it's good for me to eat out because of that reason because, and no matter where you go you can always find the salads and the meat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  Um, and it's really, to be honest with you, it -- I can go about anywhere and eat on this low carb thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, as long as you order like the hamburgers with no bun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that kind of thing.  
L:  Yeah.  I cook in a restaurant. 
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.  And --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, we have a lot of fried foods and a lot of real fattening things.  A lot of french fries and things like that.  
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  So when I go on the low carb diet I try to eat just -- I'll fry myself a hamburger.
R:  Right.
L:  And just eat that without the bread.  So I know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- what you mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about that.  And then we have -- we don't have any br- -- any vegetables at all except broccoli and corn.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And so -- but I can eat the broccoli there.
R:  Yes, you can.
L:  Or for that -- the only two things I can eat.  That -- the hamburger, the broccoli or salad.  So ...
R:  Oh.  Well, gosh, I think that's so interesting.  Um, you know, uh, I love to cook.  I just love to cook.  Um, but in the summertime I'm out swimming so much and so active I don't cook a whole lot.  But, um, as far as eating out, um, you know, we love to eat out.  That's for sure.  But, um, you know, to be, you know, uh, really on any diet, talking about this thing we're supposed to be talking about, on any diet, um, eating out, you can always work around that, I think.
L:  Yeah.  
L:  Even --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if it's low fat, you know.
L:  'Cause every restaurant has something on the menu that [inaudible] on your --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- diet.  
R:  I think you're right.  And --
L:  And when you cook at home it -- it seems like you have to cook a -- a full course meal where you have your meat, your --
R:  Exactly --
L:  -- bread, your potato.
R:  -- right.  [NOISE]  And -- and -- and who wants to cook every night?  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I sure don't.  
L:  Yeah, well, um, I live by myself so I -- it's just easier for me to eat out than it is, you know, it's --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- it's cost effective.  I mean --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you can --
R:  It sure is.
L:  -- go to McDonalds and get a double cheeseburger for a dollar or I can come home and cook a pork chop, potatoes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- vegetable and that --
R:  Exactly.  And then -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- look at the money issue there.  I mean, of course, you have to look at more than money too.  It's [MN] about the health too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Which you know eating out is not always the best thing for you.  Well, it is, I guess -- it all depends on the restaurant you eat out.  You know.  
L:  [MN] 
R:  Like, um, I don't know what restaurant you cook -- or you -- you are a chef at but so many of 'em are so fast -- fast food, like grease, grease, grease.  
L:  Yeah, the one that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I work at is mainly grease.  It's --
R:  It's mainly grease?
L:  Chicken wings.  Potato rolls.  French fries.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Every- --
R:  It's like a bar restaurant thing?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that sounds fun.  
L:  A lot of fried --
R:  Um --
L:  -- foods.  We do have oysters, you know, which ...
R:  Oh. I love oysters.  
L:  Which if you don't bread 'em and deep fry 'em you can broil them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it's healthy.
R:  But see the breading -- yeah, the breading is what -- what kills you.  It's not the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even the frying is the thing.  I mean, it's okay as long you don't bread it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  There's always some hold back isn't it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  But, of course, it tastes better when it's friend wi- in all that grease.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I know it.  I know it.  But they say, uh, the trick is to that is to fry at -- at three hundred and sixty degrees and get it in and get it out. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And there's nothing wrong with frying if you do it that the way.  What the people -- people make mistakes are is that they put it in the oil that is not hot enough.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the oil penetrates the food too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then you're getting all the fats and all that, and you just shouldn't be getting so ...  When you eat out like that, eating out or eating in, that's the -- those are things you have to really think about.  I think.  I do anyway.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, is how they do prepare the food and -- 'cause when you're at home cooking in you -- you know how it's prepared because you do it.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, um --
L:  And you don't know how it's prepared if somebody else has prepared it.
R:  No, you don't.  Unless you were real familiar with the place that you go to all the time.  Then you get to know, um, basically what it's about and wh- wh- -- the restaurant you're eating at.  But, anyway, um, you know, what else can we say about eating out and -- and your favorite [LAUGH] foods?  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Course it is nice, though, to have somebody else cook for you.
R:  Oh, isn't that wonderful.  Mhm.  Well, see my husband does not cook at all.  So if it's cooked I cook it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, like I said, which I don't mind if I'm not so busy, but at this time of year I'm so busy.  And, you know, and he loves his three squares, you know.  So, um, which I don't.  I can eat one all day and be happy.  But, um, he likes to, you know, he has to have his food and everything.  Which that's fine.  I find fun.  But still it just ties you up and think, "+Oh, do I have to cook [LAUGH] tonight?"  That kind of thing.  And then eating out is such a great option too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  When you're tired and really don't want to mess with it.
L:  Yeah, it's [MN] nice to have somebody come and wait on you and bring you the food and prepare it.
R:  I know it is.  I know it.  And then you get up and leave the me- -- you know, you don't have a mess.  You just get up and walk away from it.  
L:  Yeah.  No dishes.
R:  No dishes.  And you leave the tip and then you think, "Oh, boy that -- that feels so good".  And, um, so that is nice to be able to do that.  I -- I totally agree with that.  'Cause I think every woman has to say that that is a good thing.  Uh, not all the time, but that is a great thing to be able to do.  And 'specially --
L:  When you're on the go though on a lot, like you say you're really busy this time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of the year and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if -- you might not have time to cook and so it's a lot easier to -- for you to run through a driveway somewhere.  
R:  Yes.  
L:  And then you get stuck eating sandwiches a lot and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and the carbs there.
R:  Yeah, see, that's the problem too.  When you're out busy going here and there and then you running through [MN] drive throughs.  That's what kills you because, you know, the eating outs they do, the food that you eat in the drive through.  If you -- now, of course, they're coming through with, uh, coming out with all the new salads and all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this, um ...  Well, that's great, but eating that on the road, you know, that's a little hard to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, the fork and the dressing and the this and the that.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Where a hamburger you just hold in the paper --
L:  Yeah. And --
R:  -- and eat it and you're fine.  
L:  And go on down the road.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That convenience, convenience, convenience is not always our best friend.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's for sure.  'Cause it -- it's a double whammy to it.  But, um, anyway, um, there's all kinds of ways you can look at it, I guess.  Are you still there?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, oh, good.  It got real quiet all of a sudden.  I didn't know if you were still there or not.  My phone clicked.
L:  What is your favorite thing to cook when you cook at home to eat?
R:  Oh, let's see.  Well, let's see.  I love pork.  
L:  Do ya?
R:  Yeah.  I love pork.  I love to do, uh, ribs in the oven.  Um, and pork roasts.  Pork tenderloin.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I love to barbecue that.  That is a great thing.
L:  Yeah.  Do you like the --
R:  Uh, I love --
L:  -- the country ribs or do you like the ribs with the bone in 'em?
R:  The ribs with the bone in them.
L:  Do ya?
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- then we grill those and I love cooking those.  And then, um, um, of course steaks [MN] the filets always often[?] so we do that a lot.  But, um, that's not -- I -- I would say pork is my favorite meat to cook.  And then, of course, I -- I was brought up on eating like, um, fried okra and, uh, you know, those kind of things.  The southern dishes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I love doing all that but I don't do it anymore.  Very seldom because of that, uh, reason.  That, um, you know, I -- like cream potatoes and gr- g- uh, gravy and all [LAUGH] that stuff.  
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  But -- all that --
L:  Biscuits and gravy.
R:  -- comfort food.  Yeah.  Which I don't do that anymore either.  But, uh, that's how I was -- and I love cooking like that.  I really do.  And I love when I have my family together I can cook like that because most people in my family can eat it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but they don't -- they're -- they're health conscious so they don't like to eat a lot of it, so ...  But I still enjoy cooking it. 
L:  But sometimes when you cook a big meal like that it's just satisfying to have other people eat it.
R:  I know.  
L:  When -- when you're cook -- when I cook a lot of food I'm not really interested in eating it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know I just --
R:  In't that -- in't that --
L:  -- enjoy -- I might nibble a little bit here and there.
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  Like -- like if I'm making sausage gravy or something.  I make the gravy and then I'll nibble on a sausage while I'm making it.
R:  See.
L:  And then by the time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's done I'm just so over the food I don't even want to eat and then the people that I'm cooking for ...
R:  I know.  But that's exactly how I feel too.  Uh, when I'm cooking all this food I'm [MN] nine times out of ten, [COUGH] 'scuse me [COUGH], I don't even sit down and eat.  
L:  Yeah, I don't either.
R:  Because I'm just standing there just nibbling. 
L:  Yeah, that's what I do.
R:  [COUGH]  And I'm waiting on them to see them happy and enjoying themselves.  That's all I care about.  And, um, I think [inaudible], I do like cooking and not eat anything.  But I just nibble.  I'm a nibble eater anyway.  I like to nibble.  And I agree with you on that.  Um, you know, [MN] like ice cream or things that people -- some people just crave.  Uh, I keep it here for my grandchildren and I make them sundaes and stuff like that.  Well, you know, I couldn't care a less to have one after I deal with all that.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause [MN] I am not a sweet eater anyway. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Thank goodness.  But, um --
L:  I -- I crave chocolate a lot.
R:  Do ya?
L:  Yeah.  But I just try not to buy it and have it in the house.  That way I won't eat it.
R:  Well, see, my husband is too.  He is a chocoholic.  And I have to keep it away because he would just eat -- my -- the problem with him is that he -- he just won't eat
