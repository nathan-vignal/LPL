R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  [MN]  Hi.  My name is Judy.  
R:  My name is Lisa.  
L:  Uh, Lisa.  Glad to meet you.
R:  You too.  
L:  Um, where are you at?
R:  I'm in New York. 
L:  Oh, wow.  I'm in Kentucky.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  You can probably tell by my accent.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm originally from Tennessee.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  What?  New York state or New York City?
R:  Uh, well, New York state.  Long Island.  
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Not far from New York City.
L:  Is that where you're from?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Originally?
R:  Yeah.  Always here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So do you --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Do you have a lot of friends or just a [MN] few or ...?
R:  Uh, I guess, it's -- it's hard -- hard to think.  I've got a few really close friends but I have a lot of friends.  
L:  [MN]
R:  You know.  Does that make sense?  'Cause when you have --
L:  Right.  But that's how I am.
R:  You have kids.
L:  Right.
R:  D- do you have kids?
L:  I have a twenty seven year old and a twenty one year old.
R:  And I'm sure as they're growing up you've befriended their friends' parents?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, well ...
R:  I mean you have to in order for the kids to --
L:  Yes, well --
R:  -- play together.
L:  -- I did -- well, um, I become real close friends with, um, um, my daughter's girl scout leader and became a co leader with her.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my daughter's twenty one and -- and, uh, we're still really good -- close friends.  
R:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, my kids are little now so I have a lot of friends that I have to make, you know --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- be -- be friends with too, in order for them to keep their friendships.  But I also have a couple of my own close friends dating back from when I was in, you know, second, [LAUGH] third grade, stuff like that, that we're still friends.  
L:  Well, I'm not able to do that because I don't live --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where I was raised.  Uh, but I am lucky because I have probably four or five very close one -- friends and lots and lots of friends and acquaintances.  I just graduated from college, um, I turn fifty tomorrow.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And, um, I just graduated from, um, um, a, uh, small Christian college here.  I have a credited degree in, um, applied psychology and counselling.
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  And --
R:  My husband's a psychologist.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Cool.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, what kind of psychology does he do?
R:  He does a little of everything.  He's a licensed clinical psychologist as well as a school psychologist.
L:  Wow.
R:  So he's in a high school during the day and twice a week he has a private practice, and he teaches some college courses in the summer.
L:  Does he, um, have any, like, abnormal cases sometimes?
R:  I try to stay away from that stuff.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's my fa- -- that is -- that my -- that's my, um, favorite stuff is the abnormal.
R:  Yeah.  It's hard.  In the school district you don't really see a lot of that.
L:  Right.
R:  Mostly teen issues.  He deals with a lot of teen issues in the schools.  
L:  Right.
R:  A lot of A.D.H.D. issues.  Marriage issues.
L:  Right.  He gets them before they go full blown like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bipolar.  Before blown --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- um, uh --
R:  Some of them, I mean, he has --
L:  -- schizophrenic. 
R:  -- I have to admit.  
L:  And, you know, maybe more the earlier days.  My daughter's bipolar.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  My parents -- both my parents were.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  But I still managed to keep my friends.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I have a good friend who is.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  And she's done quite well actually.
L:  Has she?  Well, my daughter hasn't -- well, my daughter's very, very beautiful.  She looks like a model.  She can model.  She's [MN] -- she's six foot two.  Weighs about a hundred and sixty.  She's just gorgeous.
R:  Wow.
L:  She's very intelligent.  Highly intelligent, but she won't stay on her medication.
R:  Oh, that's the hard part.  My friend was so well -- my friend had a big breakdown when she gave birth to her daughter.  And after her daughter's birth she really, really stuck well to her medication and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- she was very well up until recently.  And --
L:  Oh, and is she --
R:  -- she's back on track again.  
L:  Good.
R:  More for, you know, I guess having a kid kind of puts that, I guess, more in perspective for her because she wants to be okay for her daughter.  She doesn't want --
L:  Right.
R:  -- her daughter to see.  And she has a lot of friends [LAUGH] which definitely helps.  She has a --
L:  It would [inaudible], yeah.  
R:  -- good support network.  A lot of friends who care about her.  Who are there for her when -- when things went awry.
L:  Oh, I have a question.  With your husband being a psychology student you'd think he would -- do you find that you have -- do you think you have more friends because of that or less friends?
R:  Um, you know, I don't think they mind either way.  I don't think it really affected that.
L:  I think it's a cool occupation myself.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, you know, I didn't know how people looked at it up there. 
R:  Um, they tease and joke about it.  
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  That, uh, he's always analyzing me.  And, you know, if they gonna come over my house are they gonna be analyzed?  They joke.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I don't think it's really affected, you know, cause --
L:  I'm a very analyzing person.
R:  -- I -- I guess, most person don't know 'cause when they meet me they meet me and my children either in the library or in a school setting, or whatever.  And they don't know anything about my husband or what he does.
L:  Right.  
R:  And -- right away.
L:  Right.  Uh, how old are you children?
R:  Uh, two, four and six.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good ages.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah --
R:  Fun, huh?
L:  -- let me tell you, yeah, at this point I can look back and say that's a really good ages you have.
R:  [LAUGH]  They can be, yeah.  But it forces you to really look at your social circles.  
L:  Yeah, it does.  And -- and what kind of example you're being to the children.  
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
L:  Because they soak it everything they see.
R:  Exact -- -- and it's -- it's fun to watch them make their own friendships or see how they differ.  How my oldest one, um, can walk up to anybody and just start talking to them and become their friend and invite them over and when is it --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- and think that it's their best friend for life.  And can't believe that, you know, they're not coming to his house some day soon when he's only met them once while the other -- my middle guy is the first one to hide behind my [LAUGH] back when someone talks to him.  
L:  Right.  
R:  And my daughter's like a little of both.  She hides behind me but peeks around and smiles at [LAUGH] them.  
L:  And she's the baby?
R:  Yeah.  She's the baby.  
L:  How old is she?  Two?  Just two?
R:  She was just two, yeah, in February.  
L:  She'll come out.  Being the baby she'll come out.  
R:  Yeah.  She -- I -- if she's like her older brother we're in a lot of trouble.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You see everybody's his friend.  [LAUGH]  Try and have a birthday party with that.  [LAUGH]  Everybody's his best friend.  Everybody should come over to the house.  Everybody should play.  You know, lots of friends.  
L:  Are they gonna [MN] -- most important life less- life lessons that I have learned is that you have very few true friends.
R:  That -- that's, yeah.  You know, it is true.
L:  You know, you don't have as man- you know, as many as I think we would want to have.  But, you know, 'cause I, you know, but [MN] I -- I've had these group of women that -- and they don't really -- they don't associate with each other.  They're not really in each other's circles so to speak.  They're all from different, and it -- it's really interesting that, you know, that I've had 'em through thick and thin.  
R:  Hm.  Mhm.
L:  And it's really neat to get to that point.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Where the --
R:  Definitely.  I mean, I [inaudible] -- that's why I have a few really close friends.
L:  Right.  
R:  Two or three that I really, really confide in.  But I do have friends who, like, we would go out to dinner, the girls only.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- you know, we've met through, say, library play groups or what have you.  And we associate with each other.  We have birthday parties together and we'll see each other but I don't have that closeness that I have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with somebody and I don't know if it's a matter of time, because I haven't known them as long.  Only two, three years as opposed to eighteen years.  
L:  Right.
R:  Or if it's a matter of, you know, different social circles or different backgrounds or what have you.  But, you know, I wouldn't, um, I don't call 'em and talk to them everyday.  [LAUGH]  Certainly.  But, um, you know, they would -- I wouldn't hesitate to, you know, go out because I want to get out with the girls.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  So I guess that's a -- a little more than acquaintance but not quite a true friend.  You know, like --
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Hard to describe.  It --
L:  Because those true friends are hard to find.  
R:  That is true.  They're few and far between and as we age we have different priorities and different issues and our friendships change.  
L:  Right.  They sure do.  
R:  They -- they do.
L:  And for the people to stick with you through those changes that's the miracle of it.  That's what they like, wow.  You know, they're really good friends. 
R:  Yes.  Yes.  And I think it's important to have them as we age also, um, it's just -- I think it keeps us a little sane.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It just keeps us -- keeps our momentum going.  Makes us feel better about ourselves.  Guess they're someone to talk to other than the husband.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  True.  I mean --
R:  You need that once in a while too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, I -- I get -- my husband is very intelligent.  He has had a head injury.  He's still super intelligent.  But he doesn't work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, he's very helpful to me.  
R:  Oh, that's good.  It's just sometimes you just need a little somebody else to talk to though --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think.  Where you just need somebody different.  Somebody with a different perspective who doesn't know your life as well.  Who can't --
L:  I've been --
R:  -- comment as well on it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I really enjoy this Fisher -- this is my third call with the Fisher study.  
R:  Oh, it is?
L:  I've really enjoyed this getting to talk to different women from, um, like, from Florida.  You're from New York.
R:  Mm.
L:  And -- and it's cool.  
R:  Yeah, this is only my second call but I, believe it or not, got my husband to do it as well.
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  Yeah.  I told him about it and he was very interested.  Um, he --
L:  Well, he [inaudible].
R:  -- likes the dynamics of people.  Obviously that's --
L:  I imagine.
R:  -- part of his training.  So the dynamics of people he really does enjoy.  And he found it interesting to speak on the phone with somebody and, uh, to find that most of the women -- most of the people he ends up speaking to are women.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's ...
L:  Yeah, that's funny.  
R:  So that was an interesting concept for him to try this out.  He --
L:  So how old is your husband?
R:  Uh, he's -- how old are we?  Thirty six.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Thirty six.  He's young.  Still young.  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's why we still have the young kids.  We're still young.  Not any less tired but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Still young and, yeah, and, you know ...  Are you practising or doing anything with your ...?
L:  No, no I -- I have to get my masters before I go into, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, or I -- I can counsel with a cover, so to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- speak, which I've already done some.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.  Um, I just graduated May seventeenth.  I'm gonna take my time and look around and --
R:  That's wonderful.  
L:  -- see what I
