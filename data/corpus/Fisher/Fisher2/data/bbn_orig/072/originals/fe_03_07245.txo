R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, my name's Heath.
R:  I'm Rebecca.
L:  Ah, nice to talk to ya.
R:  It's good to talk to you too.
L:  Um, so I guess, ah, we need to talk for, like, eight minutes I think it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah --
R:  Hold on a second --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- I gotta switch phones. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] There that's better.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Um, I don't know, I -- I -- I  was born in Hawaii and, ah, lived there for like eighteen years.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] so, ah, you know, that's where some of my favorite food comes from.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It would be like, ah [NOISE] oh now they have stuff called like lomilomi salmon and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, ah, I don't know, kalua pig.
R:  Huh.
L:  Pretty good stuff, I don't know.
R:  Well, I went there a couple of times.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  My favorite thing was having --
L:  Which island?
R:  Um, I've been -- been to the big island, Wahu, and, um, ah, Kauai.  I have --
L:  Okay, I was -- I was raised on the big island on the -- on the wet side.  The Hilo side.
R:  Oh.  I loved Hilo. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's a quaint little town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  With the biggest damn shopping mall I ever saw. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  I remember them building that actually.  Ah, it replaced a much smaller one actually.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know, for the first two, three years it was, ah, only about fifty percent occupied.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, ah, I guess it's pretty full now.  My parents still live there.
R:  Uh-huh.  Bet you it's hard to go home, huh?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Cost a lot of money.
L:  Um, actually 'cause, ah, we get a lot of Asian tourists --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they're not doing so well.  They actually, ah -- or the US isn't doing so hot either.  So it's not that bad actually.  [NOISE] When the economy's doing bad I can get cheap flights there.  S- -- I just have to book 'em a lot in advance.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I have a friend who grew up on Kauai.  That's why we went the last time, he was getting married.
L:  Mm, congratulations.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] So I don't know, I'm in Los Angeles now and, ah, I prefer eating at home unless it's, like, ah, I don't know, something important.
R:  I prefer eating out, that way I don't have to cook or clean up.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't mind the cooking.  It's the cleaning up actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  I l- -- I like -- kind of like of cooking, but I don't like cleaning up.  But I don't think anybody likes cleaning though.
R:  Not too many people. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I have two younger sisters [NOISE] and the deal would usually be that, ah, whoever helped mom cook didn't have to do the dishes.
R:  Ah.
L:  So I'd help mom cook and then my two sisters would usually end up doing the dishes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, when I could talk 'em into it. [NOISE]  But, ah [MN] [PAUSE] [MN].
R:  Yeah, we -- we eat out an awful lot, my husband and I.  Just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause neither one of us likes to clean up. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Unfortunately I don't -- I'm unemployed now so ...
L:  So am I.  That's why I'm doing this actually.
R:  I think they're going to get a lot of unemployed people. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ten bucks a shot. [LAUGH]  Probably wouldn't even -- even been my -- worth my trouble when I was --
L:  Well, just last month --
R:  -- had a job.
L:  -- was the highest, ah, unemployment rate we've had in, I think it was nine years or something like that.
R:  It's pretty awful.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm relaxing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- actually.  I decided to -- I've never been unemployed before.  And I didn't realize that unemployment actually pays you, ah, you know, a dece- -- I mean, it's not a lot, but it's a decent amount.  It's enough for me to survive on anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  I'm a single bachelor so no bills.
R:  I have -- my problem is that I own a two family house.  They're very popular up here in the north east.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And I rent the downstairs out to a friend of mine --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- who's unemployed.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I mean, he could probably, you know, make the rent 'cause I don't charge him an --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- awful lot anyway.  But if he gets a job where he has to move --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then I'll have to fix up his apartment and that'll cost a lot of money. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, I actually, ah, have grandparents up in, [NOISE] ah, Pennsylvania.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- no, I'm sorry, they're in New Jersey.
R:  Oh, that's a little different.
L:  Trenton, New Jersey.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I don't know, when I was a [NOISE] -- I remember when we used to go visit 'em, they'd take us out for pizza and, ah, you know they'd brag about their pizza and stuff.
R:  Huh.
L:  And there's some -- I'm trying to remember the guy's name, but there's some musician that comes from there.  Ah, really, really popular.
R:  Bruce Springsteen.
L:  Born in the -- yeah, there you go.  I was going to say Born in the USA.
R:  Asbury Park or ...?
L:  Yeah, they [MN] -- they loved him.  My grandparents loved, ah, Bruce Springsteen.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But, uh, yeah.  I don't know, New Jersey [NOISE] was kind of -- I don't know, I didn't really like it that much.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, there's -- there's a lot of different places in New Jersey that's for sure.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You may not have liked that area.
L:  They lived, like, right across from, ah, Washington's Crossing.
R:  [MN] Oh so, um, like, Newark --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- or Hoboken?
L:  -- somewhere around there, yeah.
R:  Patterson?
L:  Patterson.
R:  Patterson's where all the terrorists come from. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Or where they'd like us to think they do.
R:  [LAUGH] No, there's a big Arab community there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Be a good place for them to disappear into.
L:  Well, I think that, ah -- I don't know, [NOISE] 'cause they say that, you know, almost all those terrorists came from Saudi Arabia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think that they were s- -- out of all the lists that they have, so many cells or whatever, is Al Qaeda and all them hate Saudi Arabia because they're -- you know, they think they're bitches.
R:  Hm.
L:  So I think they specifically chose terrorists from Saudi Arabia to be the, ah -- to be the terrorists --
R:  Oh, it --
L:  -- just so that --
R:  -- could be just, you know, Bin Laden's a Saudi too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it could be that a lot of 'em are Saudi's, but I also think --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that they specifically chose Saudi's just to make a point, you know?
R:  As a matter of fact a -- a lot of, ah, the Bin Laden extended family lived in Boston right up until [LAUGH] the end of two thousand. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'd heard something about his brother actually, which I was feeling sorry for that poor guy.  I mean, to be associated -- having a, you know, [NOISE] Bin Laden as a brother.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And, I mean, he is not necessarily a -- a bad person, I don't think.  You know?
R:  It's a very large family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they keep saying that he's the only black sheep. [LAUGH]
L:  Of course, of course they're going to say that.
R:  Course the ones that lived around here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- well one -- a big chunk of them, ah, lived in very fancy digs right downtown Boston.
L:  Okay.
R:  One of the fancy hotels.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So obviously they're not the kind of people who'd live in caves and blow up things. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right, right, right, right, right, right.  They're the ones that, ah, yeah, are allowing the US to do what we do.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But [SIGH] I don't know.  Let's see.  One of my favorite places to eat out here is actually called Versailles, which is a Cuban food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- restaurant.  They make, like, ah, Cuban style pork and chicken with, ah, the plantains, you know, the fried bananas?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And, ah, black beans.  But, ah, I just had that yesterday actually. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really good.  It's kind of expensive, but it's, ah -- it's good food.  That's the problem with me with like eating out.  'Cause I'm not really like -- I don't like fast food.  I don't like french fries.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I, ah -- so I'll go to, like, some of the better restaurants.  And I mean that's like, you know, ten dollars a pop usually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that gets kind of expensive. [LAUGH]  I kinda try and save it for more special occasions to do, like as a treat.
R:  Well, we mostly go out to -- to diners or, you know, locally owned places.
L:  Right.  W- -- yeah, there's not so many of them here.  When -- where I -- when I lived in El Segundo, which is just south of the airport --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they, ah -- let's see about seventy five percent of El Segundo is business, you know, like big business, like a Chevron refinery, a, ah, you know, Hughes, ah, a lot of the big, big companies over there.  Mattel, the toy company.  But they have a small section that they, ah, have that's residential and so since they allow Chevron [NOISE] and all these big guys in there, they, ah -- they can choose to be picky and they -- they don't allow any, ah, franchises.
R:  Huh.
L:  So they're all mom and pop like privately owned, ah, restaurants.  And even the, ah, like equivalent of a seven eleven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is like, you know, a mom and pop, ah, Asian owned store.
R:  Wow.
L:  So it's kind of neat, you know.  It's a quaint little -- I mean, it's not a very large residential area, but it's, ah -- it's nice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- actually.  Then they, ah -- let's see the Raiders used to practice down there when they were in Los Angeles. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah -- oh, now we're talking about getting a NFL team in Pasadena, which I'm not a professional sports fan myself, but, ah -- so I could care less [LAUGH], but ...
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- we certainly have a lot of, ah, rabid sports fans up here in Boston, that's for sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know why they are.
L:  My room mate's a -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- rabid sports fan.  He got direct TV.
R:  Oh no.
L:  It's def-
