R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  This is Margaret and I live in San Francisco.
L:  Um, this is Sayleslie[?].  I live in Sterling Heights, Michigan.
R:  Oh, wow.  Very far.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  We're on the other side of the world.
R:  Yes, it seems that way.  How are you today?
L:  Oh, fine. It's raining and --
R:  Good.  What's your answer to the question?
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, uh, I enjoy eating at home more than I do eating at restaurants.  I like a nice home cooked meal.
R:  Do you do most of the cooking?
L:  Um, yeah.  
R:  Me too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Uh, that's -- I had to laugh when they said the topic's food because right now I'm, uh, preparing dinner and I have three teenagers and they're out of school now and all day they've been eating.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So it seemed -- when they said the word food I was like, "Oh, my gosh.  I can't [LAUGH] handle it".  
L:  [MN]
R:  And I do all the cooking too but, you know what, because I do all the cooking I love to go out and that may sound [LAUGH] really bad but it's such a treat for me.  Not so much because I don't have to cook, because I don't have to do the cleaning and the dishes after.  So I really enjoy going out.
L:  I -- I used to enjoy it more when, like, you know like when I was in your situation when our children were at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It was a break.  But it seems when we go out unless I can find some place to go where it's food that I -- I don't make at home.
R:  Correct.  
L:  Then -- then I enjoy it.  
R:  Instead --
L:  That I enjoy.
R:  Just stay -- or otherwise you'd just rather stay home and cook?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It --
L:  Right.
R:  If -- if I'm gonna have a steak I'd rather just have it on my grill.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I'm -- I'm that way with things like that.  But, um, when it comes to having a good pizza or maybe Chinese food --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I love that.
R:  That's different.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  Right.
L:  That -- that's something I would -- and then, you know, I -- I enjoy take out.  If --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if grabbing Chinese I'd -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'd just as soon have take out and bring it home.
R:  Oh, you're funny.  Oh, you're funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  See, not me.  I want to be pampered.  I [LAUGH] want them to pour me water.  I [LAUGH] want them to do --
L:  Um, for --
R:  -- my dishes.  
L:  -- uh, for a special occasion --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I like a really, really nice restaurant.  And --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to get something that I don't get at home like [inaudible] --
R:  Correct.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] or, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- something exciting.
R:  Right.  
L:  Like lobster tail.
R:  Right.  Something that you can -- it's a -- it's a [inaudible] memory.  An experience.  Something that you can, uh, look forward to and then just sit down and enjoy.  I -- I agree with you.  I know that.  Well, I, um, I will definitely, uh, take anybody up if they say let's go out.  [LAUGH]  I'm --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm the first in the car.  [LAUGH]  
L:  I guess --
R:  But --
L:  -- um, oh, a few years ago I became, um, a little bit disabled.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I have MS and, uh --
R:  Okay.  
L:  -- a bone disease.  And I wasn't able to do the type of cooking that I used to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, [MN] we started going out so much that I got --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sick of it.  
R:  Sure.
L:  And I think that that's part of it.  
R:  Sure.
L:  I miss thoroughly, you know --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- how I used to cook.  Now I'm feeling better and I'm --
R:  Good.
L:  -- doing more of my cooking.
R:  Good.  
L:  And I, uh, I just really love it. 
R:  Sure.  And now you --
L:  If I can find --
R:  -- appreciate --
L:  -- a restaurant that has, like, homemade type cooking.
R:  Right. 
L:  Not one of your chain restaurants.
R:  Right.
L:  A nice family restaurant.
R:  Right.  
L:  Then I --
R:  I'm --
L:  -- really love it.  
R:  Sure.  We're very fortunate because in San Francisco we have so much to offer.  So that's one thing that we're a little bit spoiled.  But when it comes --
L:  Are you right in the city of San Francisco?
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Oh.  
R:  So, uh, when we, um, go out we don't do the fast food at all.  Anything like that.  I try to keep my children away from that definitely because that's a big temptation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A- and on every corner you can find something that's --
L:  Oh, here too.
R:  -- junky.  
L:  Yeah, we live --
R:  So, uh --
L:  We live in the suburbs and everywhere there is, uh, fast food.
R:  Right.
L:  Everywhere.  
R:  It's not good.  
L:  No.
R:  Not good at all.
L:  But, um, there aren't that many nice restaurants.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like chain restaurants in our area.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So you don't -- you don't have that selection of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- really good food.  
R:  Right.  So definitely you want to cook then.  And you know what?  Nothing's better than, uh, especially when the -- when everyone's gone for the day, whether working or in school or whatever, and then you come home and there's a nice meal.  It's -- it is really very comforting and, um, it's good for the family just to [COUGH] or just -- even if you're not married or anything just to sit down and have that peace and quiet.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, eat your dinner and just relax.  I know that's --
L:  There's --
R:  -- that's very true.
L:  There's one thing about, uh, the restaurants that I don't like and that's if you sit down to eat dinner --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a restaurant and there's screaming children.
R:  Oh, I [LAUGH] know.
L:  I cannot -- I get sick.  It just [MN] --
R:  I know.
L:  My stomach ties up in knots and I --
R:  I know.
L:  -- look at my husband and go "Why don't they just take the kid out?"
R:  I know.
L:  You know.  Take them to the car or something.  They're ruining everyone elses meal.
R:  Yeah.  You do have to go to appropriate restaurants for -- with children too.  That's another thing that, um, people don't understand.  It -- 'cause it -- it's not only hard on the people eating around you but it's not fair to the children either.
L:  No.
R:  You know, they don't need to be there.  So that is one thing.
L:  [MN]  I've often said maybe they should have a -- a, you know, how they have no smoking, no --
R:  Right.
L:  -- children [LAUGH] section.  
R:  [MN]  I know.  Don't -- don't --
L:  [inaudible] it -- it sounds cruel but ...
R:  Listen, don't feel bad because when my husband and I do f- -- get to go out occasionally by ourselves and when we walk in the man goes, "Where do you want to sit?"  And I always say not by children.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And my husband looks at me and he goes, "You have three".  And I go, "Yeah, that's why".  [LAUGH]  I just want to sit with an [LAUGH] adult.  
L:  Well, don't you feel like you've paid your dues?  I mean ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  I have.  I have.  And you know what?  If we're gonna spend money we -- I would like to sit down and have a very good meal.
L:  And enjoy it.  
R:  I agree.  
L:  And enjoy it.
R:  That's -- that's the truth.  So what types of dishes do you enjoy?
L:  Um, I like, uh, Greek food.  We -- I enjoy going to Greek Town.  
R:  Oh, how fun.  
L:  And, um --
R:  You know, I've never done that.
L:  Have Greek food.
R:  Wow, how fun.  
L:  Um, I like Italian food.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [MN] for eating out, those type of restaurants but at home just your, uh, basic meals.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Just --
L:  Meat and potatoes and a vegetable.
R:  Sure.
L:  And I make salad. 
R:  Sure.  Good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, we have wonderful Italian restaurants and a lot of fish.  And, uh --
L:  Oh, yeah.  You're right on the coast.
R:  Yeah.  And we have, um, good Chinese food here.  And wh- -- actually we have every type of -- type of food you can [LAUGH] imagine.  But we have three basic restaurants that if we do go out that's where we go because, you know what, we feel like if we're gonna spend the money we want to make sure we know what it tastes like and also we want to know we're gonna have good service and it's going to be, uh, just something we can rely on and not, you know, have a horrible experience.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it's -- it's -- it is a treat.  So, uh, we're pretty funny 'cause we always just have the same [LAUGH] three that we do.  And we're happy with that. We really are.  So that's, uh, and then if we have leftovers they love it 'cause then they come home later and they eat again.  Or the next day for lunch.  So, uh, that -- going out is a treat.  But, um, like I said, we -- you have to have home cooked meals too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And it's important for your health also.
L:  Oh, definitely.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- 
R:  Because --
L:  That's something that you don't find very often when you go out is something --
R:  I know.  
L:  -- healthy.  
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I agree and I worry about this next generation because so many of our [MN] -- are just driving through, you know, just the fast food places and eating that food day in and day out and it's --
L:  I -- I don't know what it's like around you but I know around here that they're even, um, serving some of the fast food in our schools.
R:  Yes.  In the public school systems.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yes.  They do.  They have a -- a contract where they come in and set up a booth and that's what they do.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.  It's bad.  [LIPSMACK]  But, uh, I -- and you know what?  The kids get mad at you 'cause they don't -- they want that but I am trying to teach them that they need to eat a home cooked meal and they need to learn to cook and they need to know that they have to have the basic food groups.  And french fries [LAUGH] are not one of them.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So it's hard because as a mother you're like trying to pound it in 'em but they're so tempted from the [LAUGH] outside that they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- want all the fun --
L:  Well, and the -- the thing's that they --
R:  -- good, salty stuff.  
L:  The TV is, uh, conditioning them.
R:  Exactly.
L:  They want you, uh, little snack meals that they --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- advertise on TV and it's nothing but --
R:  I know.
L:  -- carbohydrates.  
R:  I know.  Well, look at even the green ketchup now and the --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  There's purple french fries you can -- or [several inaudible words] makes 'em or someone.  And I'm like, oh, my gosh, these -- we're poisoning these children.
L:  Ketchup's nothing but sugar.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And -- and, uh, food dye.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's very bad.  
L:  Well ...
R:  So, uh, um, I'm just hanging in there.  I'm just trying my [LAUGH] best.  And, um, I -- I bet it gets very warm in the summer though so I guess you cook light?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, see we don't have that problem but you have to think before you bake baked potatoes, I guess, on a hot day.
L:  Well, I have air conditioning so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, that wouldn't bother me too much.  And -- and we do do a lot of grill cooking during the summer.
R:  O- okay.  That's go- that's very good.
L:  A lot of things --
R:  That's what we do too.
L:  -- on the grill.
R:  I enjoy it.  I enjoy that too.  And we just light the barbecue and just cook and, in fact, I barbecue probably at least three to four times a week.  
L:  Yeah, we do too.  Even in the winter we use our --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- our gas grill.
R:  It's good.  It's really good.  
L:  Healthy --
R:  So ...
L:  -- food.  
R:  Pardon me?
L:  It's healthy.
R:  It is.
L:  That way.  
R:  It is.  And fast.
