R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  
R:  This is Sherry Rogers.  
L:  Um, uh, [NOISE] hi.  Uh, what was your name again?
R:  Sherry Rogers.
L:  Hi, Teri.  My name is Janet Hanson.  Where do you live?
R:  In Ohio.  
L:  Oh, I'm in North Carolina.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  Um, so what's your favorite pref- -- y- your favorite dinner?
L:  My favorite dinner?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ew, wow.  I don't know.  I really like a lot of different kinds of stuff.  Depends on the mood I'm in, I guess.
R:  Do you prefer to eat in a restaurant or at home?
L:  Mm.  At home, I think.
R:  At home?  'Cause the topic is, um, restaurant or at home [inaudible].
L:  Oh.  Okay.  What do you prefer?
R:  Um, at home.  What did you say, a restaurant or at home?
L:  At home.  
R:  At home?  At home most of the time.  When I -- when I go out, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I usually try something that I don't normally cook at home, like Mexican.
L:  Yeah, I do the same thing.  
R:  What's your favorite restaurant?
L:  Oh, here where I'm living right now is Nobles.
R:  Nobles?  What kind of food do they have?
L:  Oh, [inaudible], kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] mm, continental, I'd call it.  
R:  Where do you live in North Carolina?
L:  Winston, Salem.  
R:  Really?  My brother lives in -- near Raleigh.
L:  Oh.  Huh.
R:  He's a big roofing contractor.  I'm --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- sorry.  And they like to eat out more than they like to eat at home.  So -- but I cook probably twenty seven days out of the month.  So ...
L:  Oh, wow.  Do you have a family?
R:  Yeah.  Four kids and ...
L:  Oh, that's why.  I'm just by myself now.  And I used to do that.  I had three children but, um, they've --
R:  I can't afford to --
L:  -- grown now and so there's just me and the dog.  
R:  I can't affo- --
L:  And for myself I cook -- tend to cook really simple things but I'm a -- I'm a French chef so, you know, I really --
R:  You're a what?
L:  A French chef.
R:  Are you?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow.  
L:  So ...  Oh, and I've written a cookbook and, you know, stuff like --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You don't seem to be talking too much for being a French -- a French chef that has written a cookbook.  
L:  Really?  What am [LAUGH] I supposed to say?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't [LAUGH] know.
L:  Um, they -- um, it's, um, you know, I -- I like French food, of course.  But I love ethnic food and I've lived in Europe and all over the country so I like all different kinds of food.
R:  How can you buy one of your books?  When you ...?
L:  Oh, it's -- I wrote it for my children.
R:  [MN]  Oh, I --
L:  And, um, I mean, I thought about putting it together.  I mean, how I did it was, um, [LIPSMACK] I typed it up and ...
R:  Well, we have to talk about restaurants so talk [LAUGH] about restaurants, sorry.
L:  Oh.
R:  Or we won't get paid. 
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  But ...
L:  What's your favorite French?
R:  Hum?
L:  What's your favorite French entree or your favorite French dish?  
R:  Oh, uh, let me think.  There's, uh, various -- some -- there's a couple of things that I just, um, uh, there's a French chicken that I -- what I call French chicken.  That I just love.  That's for at home, you know, if I'm fixing it.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's very simple.  
L:  And, um, it's simple to do.  I can tell you how to make it.
R:  Tell me?
L:  You just get, um, a cut up chicken and, you know, wa- wash it and dry it off.  Sprinkle it with salt, pretty -- pretty good. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Sprinkle it with salt.  And, um, brown it in, um, a combination of olive oil and a little butter.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you turn the heat down and I usually put it like, um, um, skin side down first or, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- the thicker side down first and cover it for about, mm, ten or fifteen minutes on low heat.  And then, um, I turn it over and, um, and cook it without the lid until it's done and then I put it on a platter and put it in the oven to keep warm.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you pour off, all but about, mm, well, for your family probably about three or four tablespoons of the -- of the fat.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in that you kind of chop up some green onions and you put that in there and kind of soften 'em up a little.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Add some, um, dry white vermouth.  And let that almost disappear.  And then you add chicken broth, and I just use Campbells straight out of the can.  And you then can, um, [LIPSMACK] put in some chopped parsley or whatever kind of +herbs you like.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And a little butter to thicken it up and --
R:  You call 'em +herbs.  Oh, okay.  I call 'em -- [LAUGH] everyone makes fun of me.  I'm sorry, go ahead.  Finish.
L:  I bet you say herbs.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  I thought you did too at first but then you didn't.
L:  No.  I say +herbs.  
R:  Yeah, that's the right way?  I -- I'm sorry.
L:  And, um, then you just pour the sauce over the chicken and put it on the table.  Takes about [MN] --
R:  I make this -- I make chicken similar to that but after you brown it, instead of, um, olive oil I put white wine.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Cooking wine and butter.  And, um, turn it up real high right then.  Like almost boil it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, so some of the wine cooks out and then you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just add a can a, like, um, base tomatoes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And pour that over the top of it.
L:  Oh, that's almost like a Chicken Cacciatore. 
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if I have a -- there's a name for it but that wasn't the name for this one, but it's like an Italian name.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it -- it's like a Chicken Cacciatore.  That's probably maybe a variation on Chicken Cacciatore.  I like that too.  I make that once in a while.
R:  I'll have to try yours.
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  My --
L:  -- it's good.  It -- it comes -- it's got the -- the chicken car- -- it kind of caramelizes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's just got this, I don't know, this -- this wonderful taste to it.  
R:  Mhm.  What's your -- what's your ideal dinner?
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH]  Well, the kids when I was -- when they were growing up -- I have three daughters.  And they used to call it family dinner.  It was -- we used to kid about it and say it was chicken, tater, vegetable.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?
L:  And we'd have like chicken and -- and mash -- and mashed or -- or, uh, baked potatoes and then either a salad or, um, you know, fresh green beans or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, peas or, you know, something like that.  It was just a quick easy family dinner.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, so we used to make that a lot.  But I do +like pork chop casseroles I used to do for -- they liked that a lot and [LIPSMACK] um ...
R:  I cook -- for my fastest dinner is steak under the broiler, baked potato and green beans.
L:  Yeah, that's good too.  I like that.  Oh, I have -- I got -- if you like steak.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just -- I got back -- my oldest daughter got married and I did the food for the wedding.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And, um, I made a -- uh, the -- the meat was, oh, it's so yummy this way.  Um, you get a -- a -- a filet roast.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is, you know, you have a section cut of the whole filet.  However big you want the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  However many people.  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- I usually cut -- have it [MN] just [inaudible] let's see.  Maybe about five or six inches long for your family, depending on how old your children is.  Uh, children are.  It'd probably be two pieces.  You might have some leftovers.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and I let it sit out at room temperature.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Preheat the oven to four hundred.  Um, rub the outside of it with salt.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Paprika and a little cayenne.  Not a lot of cayenne unless you happen to like real spicy.  And brown it in olive oil really well on both sides, on all sides, including the ends.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Takes about five minutes on fairly high heat.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you -- I just put it, um, [LIPSMACK] on a cookie sheet on aluminium foil, and we put it in the oven for twelve minutes at --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- four hundred and then you take it out and you let it stand for ten to fifteen minutes.  [LIPSMACK]  And then you cut it, slice it.  And it's perfect.  All the way through.
R:  It sounds good.
L:  Just medium rare all the way through.
R:  I'm writing these [LAUGH] down.  
L:  Hum?
R:  I wrote both of these down.  The --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- chicken one and the roast.  
L:  Now the -- the filet thing is expensive because, um, you know, filet is expensive.
R:  Right.
L:  But maybe for a special dinner or something. But, I mean, you can make the whole thing, start to finish, in a half an [LAUGH] hour or less.
R:  Right.  
L:  And, um, and then I made for the wedding.  I made it the day before and then I just wrapped it up in foil and then the day of the wedding I took it out so it was c- -- about room temperature when I served it.  And I made Bearnaise sauce and hollandaise sauce that I served with it. 
R:  Wow.
L:  And then we had sour dough rolls that they could put the meat on if they wanted and ...
R:  Mm.  Do you know your hollandaise sauce recipe off the top of your ...?
L:  Hollandaise?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Mm.  Let's see.  Let me think.  Uh, there's a couple of 'em.  Um, I know it's three egg yolks [LIPSMACK], um, the juice of half a lemon, um, pinch of cayenne.
R:  Mm.
L:  And a half a teaspoon of salt.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And you put that in a blender and in the meantime, on the stove, melt, um, one stick of butter.  [LIPSMACK]
