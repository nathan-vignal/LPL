R:  Right.  
L:  Yeah, they don't understand what friendship means.  You do things out of friendship not out of ...  You know.  That's why I think that's why we have so little friends and we're happy with the ones that we have.  Oh, my goodness.

L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...  I'd rather 'em have not done it.  Just left me alone.

R:  I don't have that much in common with other women my age.  
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's 'cause you probably haven't met someone that you can really trust, and that's hard.  Sometimes you have to find that one friend that you can really trust. 
R:  That's true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  I have two friends like that.  That I can just [MN] really trust.  And if I ask 'em anything they'll, you know, they'll be there for me if I need ever need assistance.  If I ever need any help.
