L:  Hello.
R:  [NOISE]  Hello.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Hi.
R:  I'm sorry that was my answering machine.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm Stacey.
L:  I'm Evelyn.
R:  Hi, Evelyn.  
L:  I've never done these calls before.  
R:  [LAUGH]  This is my -- only my second one, so ...
L:  Okay, so we're supposed to discuss our food preference?
R:  Yes.  If we'd rather eat in a restaurant or if we'd rather eat at home.
L:  I'd rather eat in a restaurant.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Let someone else do the work, right?
L:  Exactly.  But the clean up especially.
R:  Exactly.  I enjoy eating ho- at home and I enjoy cooking meals but I also enjoy the ease of restaurants and [SIGH] the biggest challenge is keeping your kids good right while you sit there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, actually, my six year old is pretty good.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and I have a four month old so she's not able to disrupt.
R:  Not an issue yet.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Except for having to breastfeed her in public.  That's, yeah, so ...
R:  Right. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that was always a challenge for me too.  I think the waiting for restaurants is the worst part.  Once you actually get sat down it's not a problem but the waiting, and I know the other night we were in a bigger city and we had to wait for about an hour and that was just really long, so ...  I don't like that part but I do like eating out.  
L:  Yeah.  I do like to eat out and -- but the -- our challenge is actually my son who has nut and legume allergies.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So if they fry in peanut oil we're out of there.  'Cause usually the --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- manager will come and say we don't even want you to try it.  
R:  So do you have to ask everywhere you go, basically and ...?
L:  Yeah.  We have to let them know just how severe it is.  Um, we have to tell them he will die before we leave this building if he --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  And once they hear that then they, you know, [MN] --
R:  They make sure, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So have you found some mainstream restaurants that you're able to go out too?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Most of 'em.   
R:  Most of them.
L:  But, you know, then there's favorites that I'm not able to go to anymore.  
R:  Right.  
L:  Um, one kind of a, almost a fast food place, I can't go to any longer is Chick Filet.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  They fry in peanut oil.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, another one is the Spaghetti Warehouse.
R:  Oh, no.  Yeah.
L:  I love that one.  
R:  So how did you find out that he had the allergy?
L:  Um, just by him having allergic reaction.
R:  Had a reaction, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  And so eventually he had -- I had to go get him, you know, tested.
R:  Right.
L:  He had to get a blood test.  
R:  Huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, that's amazing.  
L:  Yeah.  Ten minutes is a long time, isn't it?
R:  It is and it's -- and it's -- it -- it seems to drag on [LAUGH] sometimes.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Because once you've discussed the subject it's like okay, well, now what?  [LAUGH]  So, yes.  Well, we, you know, we live about an hour away from restaurants and so we -- when we go down to shop and do different things then that's when we eat out but just in general we're a- -- we pretty much eat at home here because, you know, you don't want to just run an hour just to eat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, if it's more convenient you do it more often, which is a good thing that it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  saves money if you don't, you know, eat out all the time, so ...
L:  Yeah, well, after you have a couple of kids you hardly ever eat out anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I have three and one is twelve now and so now when we go out to eat he does not want to eat off the kid menu any longer and so [LAUGH] the cost --
L:  It's m- more expensive.
R:  -- has increased significantly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  For us to go to a sit down restaurant for a decent meal it's -- it's generally a minimum about forty dollars.  So it's like, whoa.  You know, so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that can be a challenge but ...
L:  Yeah, I try still yet to, um, to share my plate with my son 'cause of the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- expense or, you know, we try to earn discounts.  
R:  Yeah, exactly.  
L:  Um, you know, on mine and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I do too and it's frustrating 'cause they're -- [MN] the discounts that I could get do not always apply to the restaurants where I would like to go.  [LAUGH]  I can always get Olive Garden and Red Lobster.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, from my Discover card and stuff and -- and it's like, okay, that's fun for a while but could we try something else.  
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  [LAUGH]  Some other places that we could get something.  So ...
L:  So where in the States do you live?
R:  I live in Colorado.
L:  Oh.  Cool.  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Ohio.  Well, let's see.  I have, um, my grandparents live in Michigan so we come up there, you know, come up in that area quite a bit.  What part of Ohio?
L:  Um, oh, let's see.  South western?
R:  South western.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  
L:  Doing the map in my head?  
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we're -- we're down by the south east corner, you know, by Toledo and all that, but that's a long way from you guys so ...
L:  Yeah.  Hm.  How long have we been at it?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know, they signal when it's -- when it's ten minutes so it's like -- but it does seem like it goes on quite a while so ...
L:  Okay.  Well, let's see.  Eating at home is always nice if you can get everybody to sit down at the same time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And that's important.  I know -- I know our family tries to but it seems like these days with everybody, you know, going different directions it's a little bit more of a challenge to get everybody to sit down and eat so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they -- I read a lot of studies that said that that really, uh, contributes especially with children, you know, it really helps them when the -- when the parents are able to sit down and have dinner with them and stuff so ...
L:  Yeah, I believe that.  We always had sit down dinners growing up.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, to not have it was a special rare occasion.
R:  Right.  
L:  And it seems like to me, my family, it's the norm.
R:  Right.
L:  Rather than -- and we home school, you know.  We're, you know, together all the time but I still miss that.  
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  That's funny 'cause we home school too.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, funny.  
R:  So what a -- what a coincidence, huh?  [LAUGH] 
L:  That is.  
R:  So we are all together all the time.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it seems like, um, there's time when, um, [MN] my husband is busy and working and stuff, you know, in different ...  Summer's a good time of course, you know, a good time of year so you're always working late and stuff, so it's a difficulty to get everybody together so ...
L:  That's so funny.  I met a home schooler yesterday.  She turned out to be an expert that goes around and talks at the cities and everything.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  That was kind of neat.
R:  Well, I'm not an expert.  [LAUGH]  But I have since my kids, you know, have been little, I've never -- they've never went to public school so I guess experience, you know, is somewhat but, you know, I still have lots of time.  I'm always looking for suggestions and ideas and, you know, what works good and stuff so ...
L:  That's so funny.  You meet -- you meet one everyday now.
R:  Yeah.  It is becoming more and more common.  People are so concerned about what's going on in schools, let alone the education.  You know, but what's actually happening in school systems and stuff, so ...
L:  All right.  So let's think.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Back to the topic.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I think we've -- we've pretty much accomplished --
L:  Exhausted?
R:  -- the restaurant topic.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  There's just not, um, there's just not -- not much more, you know.  It's kind of a yes or no --
L:  It is.
R:  -- question.
L:  Unless you want to give me a recipe real fast.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  No.  [LAUGH]  Not that I know of.  [LAUGH]  So ...  So why did you choose to home school?
L:  Um, well, there's -- for me it's religious reasons.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, you know, then we also considered, um, his nut allergies.
R:  Right.  
L:  Because [SIGH] you know, we're real vil- vigilant [LAUGH].  Can't talk.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, [MN] we're focussed on it and every now and again something will slip past us --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that, you know, we're, you know, reading --
R:  And that's trying really hard too.
L:  Yeah.  We read the ingredients one last time before we give it to him and then we [MN] oh, can't take it.  You can't have it, you know.  
R:  Right.
L:  Like, um, Count Chocula[?].  I got so mad 'cause I, you know, Count Chocula had not been in this area for a long time and it was one -- one of my favorite kids cereals.  So I bought it and I, you know, I didn't even think about it.  I mean, Count Chocula.  You don't think about it.  And it did not say may contain nuts.  It says this product does contain nuts.  And --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- I'd already poured two bowls.  One for him.  One for me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no.  
L:  I called 'em up.  I was so mad.  
R:  Oh, man.  Well, what kind of nuts would you need to put in Count Chocula?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  I know.  
R:  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  But I found a -- a chocolate tasting cereal that, you know, is pretty similar.  It's called Smores.
R:  Right.
L:  It's new and ...
R:  Right, yeah, I've seen that.  
L:  But, um ...
R:  So what are your religious reasons?
L:  Um, I just don't want him growing up with the peer pressure with the lies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of evolution.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's a big one.
R:  I feel the same way.  That sounds like we might have a lot in common.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, um ...
R:  Yeah, we feel the same way and -- and evolution was always the big challenge for me in public school and so that was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something that, um, I was not ready -- plus the -- the, um, conduct of the other children.  And the influence that it could have.  I really -- it was really --
L:  Yeah, the socialization.  Yuk. 
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it was really an issue so ...  So we decided it.  It's been a challenge and it, you know, but it's definitely worth it.  
L:  Yeah.  It --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- gets -- oh, well, today, I mean, you know, it's summer.  Everybody else is out.
