L:  Hello.
R:  Hel- hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Carolyn McGlassen[?].
R:  Hi, Caro- Carolyn.  Mine's Ruth Kalinsey[?].
L:  Hello.  
R:  I live in Tacoma, Washington.
L:  Well, and I'm in Phoenix, Arizona.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  For me --
R:  I've been there.
L:  Have you?  Well, it's [inaudible] --
R:  Is it hot?
L:  It's a hundred and seven, I think.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  It got up to ninety here the other day.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And it was hot.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Well, um, I, for me, all my children are grown and I don't like to cook anymore so I like to go out to eat.  Anytime.
R:  You know, that's just about exactly the way I feel too.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Anytime I don't have to clean it all up.
R:  Anytime I don't have to cook I like it.  
L:  Well, it's -- actually when I'm -- when I'm cooking that's okay 'cause I'm a good cook, but then after you eat you have to get up sometime that night and --
R:  And clean it up.
L:  -- clean it.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that is so much trouble.  So ...
R:  I agree. 
L:  Even if it's more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- expensive to eat out, whenever I get the opportunity I do.  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, that's probably two or three times a week, maybe.  Could be more if I'm busy.
R:  Well, that sounds like me. 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  So do you take you kids?
R:  [MN]  We got it all -- we got it all solved.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Do you take your kids when you go out?
R:  Well, um, most of my kids don't live near us.  
L:  That's good.  I thought I heard, uh, children in the background.  
R:  [MN]  Uh, you heard my niece's little boy.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  And, uh ...
L:  Well, that's the --
R:  She lives --
L:  -- same with me.  I don't have anybody in this big house.  It's just the two of us.  
R:  Um.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, my niece and her husband and their two children are visiting right now, so ...
L:  Well, you know, what -- what I do --
R:  So I have to cook for a while.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I feel obligated to cook.  That's the only time I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do.  
R:  Me too.
L:  You know, like, if I've eaten out two or three nights in a row and then I say, "Well, I better cook this night because --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- if I don't he might not like it".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.  And then the other thing --
R:  Or if you have company over then sometimes we like to [MN] we like to barbecue and ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, we barbecued so much because it never rains here that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's no big thing anymore.  But the --
R:  Well, we b- we barbecue a lot and it's -- and it rains here but we just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have a covered patio.  We get used to the rain.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So we barbecue year round.
L:  Oh, that's good.  That's really good.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Um, I would say even when people come over I -- we just do pot luck things and they usually bring stuff.
R:  Oh, that's a good way to do, you know.
L:  Yeah.  It is.
R:  Okay, they said --
L:  And I end up --
R:  -- we were supposed to describe our favorite meal.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh, did you catch that?
L:  All I heard was, um, would you rather go out to eat or stay home?
R:  And then they said -- and then they said, and -- and describe your perfect meal.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, the perfect meal.  That we cook?
R:  Well, they -- I guess they weren't specific about that.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay, well let's do both.
R:  It didn't seem like it.  I wasn't taking notes.  I should have I guess.  I wasn't --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- expecting it.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
R:  Um ...
L:  Um, my favorite --
R:  Steak and lobster.  That's gotta be it.  And cheesecake.  [MN]
L:  Oh, is -- is -- and that should be probably out when you eat, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you don't do it at home do you?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, um, for me, probably I would say fish.  When I eat out the perfect meal is, um, a f- a fried fish with a great salad bar.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I like --
L:  And, um --
R:  -- a good salad bar too.  
L:  Any kind of dessert for me.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But when I'm at home my favorite thing is, because I do it so well and it's -- my husband loves it any time, is fried chicken.
R:  Mm.  
L:  And, um, he really, really loves that so ...  It's not very healthy and we --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- always try to do the lean thing around here but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for most of the part, um, when I do cook I'm ve- I do it very healthy.
R:  That's good.
L:  So it's chicken most everytime I cook.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just because it's -- it's the healthiest thing so ...  Chicken, vegetables and ...  So when I go out I pretty well treat myself to whatever I want.  
R:  Yeah.  That's a good way to do.  
L:  And it used to be just maybe once or twice a month.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I thought, well, if we're eating out and it doesn't matter, uh, how many calories because I can make it up with my own cooking, but now that I'm eating so much out then that has taken a toll on my cholesterol so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, don't find too many really healthy restaurants around.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.  
R:  I found -- I found one in Salt -- in Salt Lake ...  In Seattle.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you?
R:  That -- that we really quite like and it's -- it's a -- a Mexican restaurant.  And they specialize in doing low fat things and heart healthy.  They have a little --
L:  Really?
R:  -- heart thing that goes on their menu like a -- like a star --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  That says --
L:  Well --
R:  -- this is -- this is good for ...
L:  Yeah.  I don't find much at, um, Mexican restaurants that's heart healthy.  Even when they say it is.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  The restaurants that mark those things, when you actually --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- check out what they're doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it wouldn't be what -- how you would cook it at home but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know, as long as I don't have to cook at home I'm fine.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, we like this place.  We don't go there real often because we -- we used to live there but we don't live close anymore so ...  We should go there.  We haven't been there in a while.  
L:  Yeah.  Well ...
R:  Well, that's me.  I -- I don't want to, uh -- I don't enjoy cooking just for me.  And I don't enjoy cleaning up.  
L:  Yeah.  And do you -- is your husband with you?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So when you say me it's the two of you, huh?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And the same with me.  Um ...
R:  But he likes it -- he likes me to -- to put on a meal and to set the table and he doesn't want to eat in front of the TV.  He wants to sit at the table --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with it.  With the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything sat and laid out.
L:  And that just makes it special for the two of you and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's the way we do too.
R:  And it makes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it a lot of work when we have [LAUGH] --
L:  It is a lot of work.  
R:  -- extra people.
L:  Does he help you with the dishes afterwards?
R:  Sometimes he does and sometimes not.  It just depends on what else is going on for him.
L:  Yeah.  It's pretty rare for me and so I always --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- make sure I do the -- I clean it up before I go to bed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I don't like getting up to it.  And --
R:  Oh, who does?
L:  That is, um, it makes, uh, for a long night, you know. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause he would rather just sit and be together rather than my cleaning but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if I take ...
R:  Well, say, "Grab a dish towel, honey".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Can't teach an old -- a old dog new tricks.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I -- I didn't really actually understand what that was until I -- what that meant until I -- 
R:  Until you got an old dog?  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- got older.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Oh, well.  So, um --
R:  That's right.  They're very well ingrained in the way things ought to be.
L:  Uh-huh.  Tell me, what kind of foods do you like?
R:  Uh, I -- I'm an Idaho farm girl.  I like meat and potatoes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, me too.
R:  Probably not very good but that's what I like.  And I like a nice salad.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I have a terrible sweet tooth.
L:  Oh, I do too.  That sounds exactly -- I'm from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Louisville, Kentucky.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And wh- -- I grew up on -- on a lot of f- fatty foods but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was always potatoes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a vegetable of some kind there too.  
R:  Well, we never --
L:  And, um --
R:  -- had a meal without potatoes when I was growing up.  
L:  That's right. 
R:  No meal --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- was complete without potatoes in some form.  
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  And -- and now my husband is on this protein kick which is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- no carbs at all.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it is so boring that ...
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't like that.
L:  I mean, he doesn't care what -- how I fix --
R:  I just think --
L:  -- the meat because he can have it fried or whatever.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the same way when we're out.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and when we're out though he'll take all the meat and then I can have all the vegetables and potatoes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So between a salad and -- and -- I think it's even cheaper to eat out than it is for me to cook at home.
R:  It probably is.  
L:  Yep.
R:  It probably is.  We have a garden so ...
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  It's not producing a lot yet but when it [MN] ...
L:  And that -- that's a lot cheaper.  And a lot better.
R:  When it does then we have -- we have wonderful salads and lots of tomatoes and squash and corn and ...
L:  Well, that -- that would be --
R:  Green beans.
L:  -- good for eating at home.  But I just couldn't care a less about cooking.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And you know what happens after that is you forget how to cook.  You know, I find the things I cooked now are not as good as they were --
R:  Well, not only that --
L:  -- five years ago.
R:  -- but recipes I thought I'd never lose be -- so I haven't written 'em down, I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go, let's see.  
L:  I know.
R:  What -- what was that?
L:  Well --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I never read a recipe.  I just do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the whatever I think goes in it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it doesn't taste as good as it did.  And I found that with my mother before --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I left home.  She got to the point she wasn't cooking so much and then when she did it was just kind of medium.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I find this happening to me.  Where I ev- -- I don't have that excitement about what should I cook and how to do it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
