R:  Hi, I'm Kate.
L:  Hi, I'm Carol.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Good.  Where are you from, Kate?
R:  Um, I'm from New York.  Upstate New York.
L:  Oh.  I'm from downstate New York.
R:  Oh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, we're kind of neighbors.  
L:  Yeah, sorta, kinda.  
R:  Long distance friends I guess.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Since that's the topic today.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So, uh --
L:  So that's a nice topic.
R:  -- have you been in -- yeah.  Yeah, it's a good one.
L:  The last one I had was sports.  I didn't know what to say.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I had movies and, uh, gosh I don't even remember the last one.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ma- -- hobbies.  
L:  Oh, that's fun.
R:  So friends are easier. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I, uh, I live with one of my friends.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, actually I have -- I guess what you'd say, I have one group of friends that I'm very close with and then, of course, you have many people that, you know, you get together with maybe once a year and not even that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, there are about four girls that I'm really, really close with still, um, that I went to college with.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, so we get together all the time.  [LAUGH]  And some of them drive like three and a half hours [LAUGH] on those weekends.  I feel bad but, um, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's nice.  
R:  How 'bout you?  Do you see friends often or ...?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I mean, um, it's funny.  Uh, I'm single and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- a lot of my friends are married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so they're, you know, a lot of my old friends I don't really see so much anymore because they're so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- into the couples thing that, um -- I have other married friends who, you know, I'm just kind of a part of the family really.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I have different friends from different kinda social circles.  And some of them are old friends from work.  Um, I don't really keep up with the college people anymore.  I still have high school friends.  Stuff like that.
R:  It's funny, people seem to either really click with their high school friends and stay close with them or really click with the college group.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  You -- you see either or.  I moved a few times --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, with my family so I have a few select friends from each place when I was going through grade school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it -- it was college that I really bonded 'cause I was there, you know, for the four years straight, plus afterwards I still lived with them.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I -- I think that's where it came from.
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's actually some overlap with me between [LAUGH] high school and college.  Some of my friends have gone to the same place.
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  But, um, oh, you know, I have friends from, like, different, like -- like spiritual activities that I do.  And -- and, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, uh, gosh, I've made a lot of internet friends.  I stay friends with old boyfriends.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, I always try to do that also.  You know, I -- I think -- I think, you know, you liked them for a reason in the first place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The person they were.  So just because it doesn't work out, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- on another level doesn't mean that I can't stay --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- friends with.  
L:  It usually lasts until they get married, you know.  And then it's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- kind of weird.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I've, uh, I mean, like, my next door neighbor is a good friend.  I have friends all over the place.  I make friends easily.  
R:  Same here.
L:  And, uh --
R:  I -- I'm pretty social.  I think you actually you'd have to be somewhat social to be comfortable doing this.
L:  I was just thinking that.  It was like, you know, I'd kinda like to be friends with some of these people [LAUGH] I talk to.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I know. Some of them are really cool.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...  Yeah, but it -- I find that, um, you know, you -- you have different friends also depending on what it is that you're doing.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  'Cause, you know, not even your closest friends may not share all of your interests.
L:  Right.  
R:  So some of them you -- you do just because -- you just hang --
L:  Yeah.  And m- my friends don't --
R:  -- out with [several inaudible words].
L:  -- all like each other either.  It's, uh --
R:  That can be awkward.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Pending, you know.  Like --
L:  Like when I -- I had a housewarming party, uh, when I moved into this place about eleven years ago and there were like little cliques all over [LAUGH] the apartment because ...
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.  They -- they didn't, you know, they just didn't particularly -- they -- they were from different -- friends from different things.  From different --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- activities and they -- they --
R:  Yeah, like -- like the bond.
L:  -- didn't particularly jibe with each other.  You know.
R:  [MN]  Mm.  Well, I, uh, I also -- it's -- it's hard because I -- I don't usually find myself in conflict with people and -- and if I am I normally talk through it.  It's not something that's explosive or, you know, what not.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some people are like that.  You know, get in big tempers and that can be awkward when you're the connecting bond between [LAUGH] them.  And, you know, they -- they're all still hanging out because of you but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, y- y- you're the one they talk to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I've had that all my life.
R:  But you only have two ears.
L:  I've had that all my life.  Gosh, I'd -- my two best friends in high school couldn't stand each other.  
R:  Isn't that funny?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they're jealous of the person inbetween. 
L:  I think it might've been that.  Which [MN] -- it makes me laugh 'cause I don't feel like I'm somebody to be fought over, you know.  I'm just me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, it was kinda like that.  
R:  Either that or, you know, different aspects of your personality match one and then the other so they --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have very little in common.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Because of you that's combining one person and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then, you know, for them they're thinking, "What the heck is that person doing with her?"  But --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, so ...
L:  Tell you one thing.  None of my friends would do this.  Because -- you know, I haven't even --
R:  Oh, really? 
L:  -- told them.  They'd be like, "What are you doing that for?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm doing it to get the ten bucks a phone call personally.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, why not?
L:  I haven't been paid anything yet but [MN] ...
R:  How many calls have you had?
L:  Um, I -- I've only had three that I've been home for and one of them didn't work so ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah, this is my third one.  I just missed one so I called in so ...
L:  Oh, you can call in and do that?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's an eight hundred number.  
L:  I didn't even know about hat.  
R:  Yeah.  If you go back --
L:  It hooks up on this --
R:  -- onto the website --
L:  -- thing named Craig's List.
R:  -- you can probably get it.  
L:  Do you know what that is?
R:  Mm.
L:  It's, um, this thing on the internet that, you know, people advertise stuff for sale and junk [LAUGH] like that.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  How'd you find out about this?
R:  Um, I found out about it through the internet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't even remember how.  I just fell upon it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, yeah, and -- and it's funny, you know, you -- you talk to people and after you get off you're like, "Oh, that person was doing interesting things" and, you know -- you know, you almost feel like if I lived closer to them maybe they would be a friend.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ... Yeah.  I don't know.  And I, uh, have you always lived in New York?
L:  Yeah.  Except for, you know, like graduate school.  I was in Chicago for a year and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I was in France for a year.  My junior --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- year.
R:  That's so ...
L:  You know.  And I'm actually gonna leave New York soon.  And I'm moving to a place where I have friends.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I made all these --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- friends in California.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  So, um, so that's where I'm gonna go.  
R:  That's cool.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I, um, I found that I really enjoy writing, so writing letters or -- or emailing people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is something that -- it's not a task to me.  It's enjoyment so it hasn't been difficult to maintain friendships that are long distance on my end.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yet sometimes --
L:  The internet has made it much easier.  Absolutely.
R:  Sometimes other people, you know, that's not something they enjoy so it's hard because they don't reciprocate.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then you always have those friendships that, you know, you don't see the person.  Um, you know, it doesn't matter if you haven't seen them for two years.  You -- you know, you step off a plane you see them and it's as if you never left.  
L:  I've had that with people who I haven't seen in ten years.  I think --
R:  Yeah, espec- -- 
L:  -- you're a lot younger than I am [LAUGH] so ... 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Um, but [MN] --
R:  But it's phenomenal, you know.
L:  You've got the sound of --
R:  You don't find that with everyone.  Some people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are very day in day out and you have to see them everyday otherwise it's awkward.  You know, you see them and it's like, "Hi.  How you doing?  Nice hair.  Blah".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  You know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I have -- I have these two friends.  They're a married couple.  It's -- it's the guy that I'm really close too.
R:  Mm.
L:  He's the like the brother I never had.  He gets mad at me if --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we don't see each other at least once a week.  
R:  Oh, well that's --
L:  Goes through like Carol withdrawal.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it's nice though to have that too.
L:  Yeah.  It's good.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I only have sisters and I -- I used to, um, live -- my family, uh, neighbors had, um, three sons and so the one that was my age ended up being what I consider my brother.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because, you know, I mean, he's close by and I -- I didn't have one and -- and it -- it's funny, you know.  It's a different kind of connection than with a sister so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  So that was cool.
L:  I don't have siblings at all so I tend to make everybody into my [LAUGH] family.  
R:  [LAUGH]  That's funny.
L:  Very, very close --
R:  Yeah, I mean -- 
L:  -- friends.
R:  I -- I would consider my sisters, um, two of my closest friends.  
L:  Mm, that's nice.
R:  In -- in an interesting way, you know.  When -- when we see each other it's like there's no bond that can be stronger.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we don't necessarily talk often.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But we certainly can hang out as friends.
L:  Uh-huh.  That's great.  
R:  But, uh, the -- the thing about the sister part is that, uh, if you, you know, argue you can get madder at that person than ever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ten minutes later you walk in there and "You want to go do something?"  "Okay, sure".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you can almost like really let it rip with a -- with a family member 'cause you know they won't abandon [LAUGH] you.  You know.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, it's family, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Do they live near you?
R:  [MN]  Um, actually, no.  They live about five hours away.  So -- so that's kind of -- I -- I guess it depends on what you consider near.  [LAUGH]  But, um, but my housemate --
L:  Do you stay in the same town that you went to school?  Is that what happened?
R:  I went to college up here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so I stayed here for that, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  Um, but my -- my housemate, she was basically like a sister 'cause I've lived with her for five years now so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, so for most of college and a few years after.  But, uh, yeah.  I don't -- I don't know if any of my friends would do this.  Maybe she would.  But I -- I don't know if any of the other ones would.  
L:  Actually my friend, Larry, might.  The one -- the brotherly one.  He might --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- do it.  
R:  Yeah.  Actually I think my boyfriend might do it.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He might [MN] oh sure.  He likes to talk about anything so ...
L:  [LAUGH]  It was really funny because the last, um, the last person I talked to I felt like, you know, we could really hit it off here.  You know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, she was from Chicago and, uh, the subject was -- was sports teams and whether, you know, they should go on strike and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we ended up talking about how, you know, can't even take this topic seriously.  [LAUGH]  And, you know, and her husband's a big sports nut and neither of us were and it w- was just --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- really funny how we bonded over that.  Knowing nothing else about each other.  
R:  Well, that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- interesting.  Where in California are you planning to move?
L:  The Bay area.  
R:  Isn't that -- is that --
L:  Like Berkeley, maybe.  You know --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- [MN] somewhere near San Francisco.  But not in San Francisco.
R:  Okay.  My, uh, sister is just about to move to L.A.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh, she'll be moving out there in July and going to F.I.D.M.  That school.
L:  What's that?
R:  It's a Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.
L:  Oh, okay.  Uh-huh.  
R:  So ...  Yeah, it's -- it's funny.  You can talk to somebody for just a few minutes and you find places, you know, that -- that are in
