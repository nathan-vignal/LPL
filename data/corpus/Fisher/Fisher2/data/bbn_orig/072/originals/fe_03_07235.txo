L:  [NOISE] And -- and, um, so how did you say you feel now? 
R:  Oh, well, I mean, I feel like I know a lot of people, but I guess I only have a few that I talk to very much. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If that makes sense.
L:  Oh, like, you talk every day to one of your friends?
R:  Yeah, just to, like, I mean, I only tell a couple of them, like, a lot of stuff and the rest, you know, you just kinda see around and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or you email every so often. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's great.  Yeah.  Maybe, like, [LIPSMACK] I don't do that, usually sometime I [LIPSMACK] have, um, two friends, like, I go around --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but sometimes, I -- I -- I joke with them over their messages, but I don't call them. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, but I saw them the other day.  [inaudible] and, um, [LIPSMACK] and -- and can you tell me, so you -- you finished school in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Rochester?
R:  Ah, no, I went -- I was up, ah, the University of Texas, in Austin.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then I moved here last year -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to work.  And --
L:  Oh, to work?
R:  -- yeah.  
L:  Oh, uh-huh.  Oh, so you, like [several inaudible words] some -- some of the computer things.
R:  Ah, chemical engineering.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Great.  Chemical engineering, yes -- very -- very great.  Very good subject.
R:  [LAUGH] What about you?  What are you doing?
L:  Oh, I'm doing [inaudible] computer science. 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  Yeah, with City College.
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  But my friend he -- he finished his degree with chemical engineering --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that's great, so y- y- you, oh, so you are living there, oh, that's good.  So you moved from your family away, no?
R:  Yeah.  And that was kinda hard because, like, when I moved here it -- a little bit over a year ago, last May, and I moved here and I didn't really know anyone, so I don't know, I had to, like, make new friends and I'm still, like, trying to make more friends --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- because it's hard, you know, like, you go to a new city and stuff.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, oh, I can imagine.  Same thing happened to me when I came to America.
R:  Yeah, where are you from?
L:  Oh, from, ah, like, Kazakhstan.
R:  Okay. 
L:  That's somewhere in -- close to China.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, move -- so it seems like your job doesn't take much away time from you.
R:  [LAUGH] My job?  It's just --
L:  Yeah, because you -- you still, like, want to meet people.
R:  Yeah, I mean it's just a standard -- I work standard forty hours and then --
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't know, at first it was tiring, because I wasn't used to that, 'cause, you know, school schedule is just, like, you study all the time [LAUGH] and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, like, there's always a test coming up, so you're always studying, but, like, when you're working, like, it's like you do your work and then you leave it there [LAUGH] and then you have time --
L:  That's right.  Chemical engineering is very hard [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.
L:  So and, ah, so you feel like now you have more friends, or ...?
R:  Yeah --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- I do.  But --
L:  When you were -- when you were in school, when you were finishing your --
R:  Oh, um, no, I don't, I mean, at college I had more, I think.  It was easier for me to meet people, like, in -- I was living in the dorms for a couple of years and it's just easier to meet people.  Um, [NOISE] here, like, in Rochester, it's, like, not -- like, there aren't very many young people.  
L:  Oh, really?  Oh --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's a lot of older people, like, families and stuff, so it's harder to -- to meet people, like, your own a- -- like, that are young, like, and, um, I don't know --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- it's just been hard -- especially, like, meeting people outside of work.  Like, I know all the people that -- I work at Kodak and I know a lot of people at work there --
L:  Where do you work, sorry?
R:  At Kodak. 
L:  Oh, great.  Well --
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  And so you -- it's kind of hard to -- to go round there.  You don't have, like, for example, [inaudible] I live, like, like, thirty minutes from, uh, like, Manhattan.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But you don't have, like, something like that, no?  Or like --
R:  Yeah, I mean, like, the closest big city is Toronto and it's three hours -- I mean, Buffalo it's, like, an hour, but [LAUGH] ...
L:  Mm.  Oh, then -- oh, then you came from warm to cold conditions.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] That was hard to adjust to also. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  Especially this past winter. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I -- I hear you and [inaudible] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Becau- -- for me it was the opposite.  I came, kind of, from cold [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- but still I didn't like the cold sometimes. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [NOISE] And, um, I, for example, I -- I -- [inaudible] maybe, I had friends when I was younger, maybe when I was, like, twelve or ten --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I had mo- more friends.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But friends is, like, [inaudible] for different people, like, they were friends, but they were not close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, but now, I'm [LIPSMACK] kind of not worrying about that because I -- I'm -- I -- I'm thirty five with the [inaudible] you know, 'cause, um [LIPSMACK] just the -- the school and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um --
R:  Just busy with other things?
L:  Right.  And, um, but no, everything is fine.  I -- I will finish school at the fall and --
R:  When are you done?
L:  Ah, this fall -- fall.
R:  Ah, this fall?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's good. 
L:  So, what I don't know [inaudible] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, maybe s- some day I will go to Buffalo some day.  Actually I went to Catskills.
R:  You went to -- oh, the Catskills?
L:  Yeah, that's like halfway from -- to the Buffalo --
R:  Yeah, did you camp, or what were you doing?
L:  Oh, I went there to fishing and skiing.
R:  Oh, okay.  Nice. 
L:  So [inaudible] and, um, are you planning to, like, bring your family to visit you?
R:  Um, my --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- parents have come up a couple of times.
L:  Oh, they -- a couple of times have been there, yes, that's great. 
R:  Yeah, well they --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- helped me move -- they helped me move --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then they came for Labor Day --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- last year.  So ...
L:  So, so you showed them around and [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah, I did.
L:  Oh, I can imagine [several inaudible words] yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible] oh, and huh, but, um I -- I might, um, move over some day --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words].  But, um, [LIPSMACK] and, ah, well, maybe you should ask me something.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, so how long -- how long ago did you move to America?
L:  Oh, oh, like, ah, seven years ago. 
R:  Oh, yeah -- did you move to, like, study for college and stuff, or ...?
L:  Mm, no.  Immigrant. 
R:  Oh, your whole family moved?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [NOISE] It was great. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] But you know what --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I thought, like, people from Texas they have this accent --
R:  What? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  People from Texas have an accent?
L:  Yes. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I don't hear any --
R:  Yeah, we- well see it's weird, 'cause some people tell me that I have an accent and other people are like, "I'm so surprised you don't have an accent". [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It -- it's really funny. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] You don't have it.
R:  Yeah, I don't think I do. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, so was it hard when you moved here, like, making new friends and, like, meeting --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yes, it was hard and then I couldn't work, because I -- I couldn't speak --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and, ah [inaudible] came to its place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, it was hard.  I -- I -- I think, yeah, like, I -- I imagine, like, [inaudible] nowadays similar to me when I came.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, great.  So, do you have many hobbies you ...?
R:  Um, like, well, I mean, I volunteer a lot.  Like, I do girl scouts, so --
