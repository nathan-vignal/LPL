R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess they're the ones that I've just met like through other friends, or at the coffee shops that I used to live above.  I'd go down there.  It was like my living room, was the coffee shop.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?  And you --

L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, that's good.  
L:  Yeah.  Are you friends with anyone you work with or ...?

R:  From New Jersey.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So I still see a lot of those friends that I had from there so ...  Which is good.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  So, uh, is this your first survey that you had to do?
L:  No, this is the third one.
R:  Oh, the third one?
L:  I mean, I'm getting my friends to do it though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, are you?  Yeah, that's what I wanted to do too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now -- now when they do it do they just have to call the same number and stuff?
L:  Yeah, I think so.  
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  They just sign up on there.  
R:  Right.  Oh, well, that's good.  
L:  [inaudible].  But, um, it's my -- my best friend that I have, even when we live in different states or countries or anything, like we can not talk for, you know, like two months or something and it'll be just the same.  
R:  As if you'd spoke to them yesterday, right?
L:  Yeah.  Like when I came back from France, um, she showed up at my house and she was [MN] five months pregnant which was a big thing.
R:  A big surprise?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, [LAUGH] well, when I was used to it, but be- beyond that.  
R:  Right.  
L:  Y- yeah, her saying -- her being like pregnant and -- and -- and me just coming home but beyond that it was exactly the same.  You know, we just went out and got [several inaudible words].
R:  And you just pick up right where you left off?  
L:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  I have a friend like that too.  I didn't talk to her for like two years and the first time we seen each other again it was just like it was yesterday.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are -- are most of your friends are like men or women?
R:  What's that, I'm sorry?
L:  Are most of your friends men or women?
R:  Um, women.  What about you?
L:  Be- --, yes, besides just, uh, the one woman that, like my best friend, most of my friends are all male.
R:  Oh, really?  Do you get along --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- better with them?
L:  Yeah, I do.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, that's good.

R:  Yeah.
L:  I like it.  
R:  You think so, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Just -- I just never get along with women as well.  
R:  Oh.  Well ...  And some people are like, you know, they -- they get along with one person, you know, men or women, you know.

L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, some of them aren't so --
R:  Are all right.
L:  -- good about it.  But the ones that actually, like, get to know me. 
R:  Right.
L:  Then -- then they're -- they're fine.  But they're always like, you know, cautious or weird at first.
R:  Yeah, in the beginning, right?
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, people feel uncomfortable, I guess.  
L:  That's too bad though.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I have -- I have no problem.  Like if I'm dating somebody I have no problem if he has --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, really good female friends or anything.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, that's good.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So ...  [LAUGH]  How many minutes you think we talked?  [LAUGH]

L:  Mhm.
R:  So do -- now do you babysit your friend's child a lot or ...?  Do you do that --
L:  Yeah, well, it -- it -- it's like spread.  Like right now I do it maybe like one night a week but, I mean, if she's on -- she wants to do more that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- fine with me.  
R:  Now do you babysit for anybody else or is ...?
L:  No, just her.  
R:  Just her?

R:  Mhm.
L:  And so I mean that's most of my time and I -- I do mystery shopping.
R:  Do you?  Do you like that?
L:  Mhm.  Yes, it's plenty of fun.  [LAUGH]

L:  Which is nice.
R:  -- you get to go out with your friend and have dinner and ...
L:  Yeah, plenty of time for [several inaudible words] being me, like if I can't find anybody, I'll just go down to the coffee shop.  And it'll be like, "Somebody come eat with me.  It's free".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  And I'm sure ...
L:  [LAUGH]  It's -- it's -- it's [inaudible] sometimes.  Just like people I don't really know so well and if I get to know them and then they get free food.  I get free food and I get paid.
R:  And you get paid for it.  
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Meet some people that way.
R:  That's making friends.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, that's good.  I like to try that.  You know.  'Cause everybody would want to go get free food, that's for sure.  
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...  Well, that's good.  Um, let's see what else?
