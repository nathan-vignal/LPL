L:  Hi, my name is Alice.  
R:  Hi, Alice.  I'm Tania.
L:  Hi, Tania.  What state do you live in?
R:  I'm in Wisconsin.  And you?
L:  You're where?
R:  Wisconsin.
L:  Wisconsin.  Wow.  I'm in California.  We're critter across the United States from each other.
R:  Yeah, I guess we are.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  This is kind of exciting.  Is this your first call or have you had others?
R:  Yeah, this is my second one.  
L:  Your second one.  Well, I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] we're just about even.  I did one a while back and then since then I've been so busy when they call I didn't get back online.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  This, yeah, this -- that's exactly how it happened for me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, what kind of weather you got now in Wisconsin?
R:  Oh, it's beautiful.  It's absolutely gorgeous.
L:  Yeah, we've had -- kinda had gloomy weather for June in California.  It's overcast and a little bit drizzly.  And looks that way for all week.  
R:  Oh, that's not good.  I been to --
L:  I guess we're --
R:  -- California before but ...
L:  Oh, have you?  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  I guess we're supposed to be talking about friends.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah, I guess we are.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Now --
R:  Well, I think the topic was if you have like a large circle of friends or if you just had a few close friends.  And I don't apply to either one.  I mean, I've got [LAUGH] I've got both.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I agree with you.  I have the same way.  I have a lot of friends online on the computer that I've never met.  
R:  Me too.
L:  [MN]  That, uh, and yet I feel just as concerned and as close with them as I do my neighbors.  
R:  Exactly.  It's the same way for me too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've met some really nice people online.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Do you bowl or have any sports?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Do you [MN] like to bowl or have any particular sports?
R:  That's my phone.  
L:  Oh.  You must be on a cellphone?  [LAUGH]  Are you there?
R:  Yep, I'm here.  Is that better?
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  That's --
R:  I'm here.
L:  -- better.  [LAUGH] 
R:  All right.  Usually I get really good reception but ...  Okay.  Um, as far -- no, not really.  I used to play softball but I blew my knee out, but I still hang around with a lot of the people that I, you know, that I played ball with and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, well, I'm thirty three and most of my friends or my really close friends, I'm so lucky, is that my friends from high school are still my friends.  
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  And -- and the nice thing is, is that we can even, like, not talk for a year or so and then --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we'll just call each other up and it's just like [several inaudible words].
L:  Pick right up and take off with it again.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  
L:  My daughter has friends that, every year, all the gals get together and they go to the beach for a week and the daddies all take care of the kids and all.  And, uh, they get to have a good gab session for a while and then, I don't know what the daddies get to do in return but, uh, whatever it is anyway it works out real nice.  [LAUGH] 
R:  We do that here during deer hunting season.  Because --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we're all deer hunters' widows.  
L:  Sure.
R:  That [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.
R:  During that week and so, hey, that's like girls week away or whatever, you know.  It's -- it's great.  
L:  Yeah, well, I think it keeps marriages together too because you do need some separate time that way.
R:  Yep, you sure do.  You sure do.  You know, I -- I thank God for my friends everyday.  Everyday they're just awesome and I guess I'm one of the lucky ones because a lot of the people I talk to, you know, they just -- they don't seem to have a lot of friends or, you know, [MN] --
L:  I know.  I would be miserable if I didn't have somebody and my husband will tell me that's because I like to gab.  And maybe that's true.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I --
L:  But --
R:  -- think the only way to have good friends is to be a good friend.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know.  And -- and I'd drop anything, you know, whatever I'm doing if one of my friends needs help, you know.  And they do the same for me.  I am -- I'm so blessed with it.  
L:  Sounds like you might be a Christian too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  You can tell --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the difference.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I went through a really bad relationship and actually my ex fiance's parents are the ones that really, um, got me back again to where I should be and --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- and they're still really good friends of mine so ...
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  You know, it's ...
L:  Well, that shows maturity on your part.  [MN]  You know, for, uh, letting them help you.  
R:  Well, you know what?  I don't think they'd let me get away.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  There you go.  [LAUGH] 
R:  They call me all the time and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- try to get us back together but, no.  Uh-uh.  I just -- I can't do it right now.  
L:  Yeah, well, it might be too quick.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.  
L:  Well, and it's kind of exciting to know what God's plans are for you too.  On down the road they'll be something.
R:  Oh, yes, most definitely.  Most definitely.  And, you know, and it's just like, you know, that situation.  My friends got me through that too and [MN] I don't know what I would've done without 'em.  
L:  Well, I know my daughter is, uh, going through a similar situation and she's in +Colorado and, uh, my other daughter flew back there to be with her and help her to move out and get reorganized, and what have you.  And the second daughter has friends in +Colorado that go to the same church where my daughter is -- is attending now.  And so they're gonna look out for her and, uh, you know, help her whenever it gets rough and -- and be there whenever she needs it.  
R:  Yeah.  Um, and she's so lucky.
L:  Oh, that's for sure.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's so lucky to have them.  
L:  It's just --
R:  You know and there -- there's a group that I'm with, um, that I -- a discussion board that I go to online.  Actually I've got a window open on there right now.  And, you know, whenever something happens with somebody immediately, immediately they start a [inaudible] fund and, you know, start doing paid searches for them and -- and it's just amazing how people across the world come together, you know, just because of friendships that you develop.  It's --
L:  That's right and risking being vulnerable with letting somebody know that you need help.  I think a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- lot of people are afraid to reach out.  
R:  Right.  But you know what happens most of the time.  It's like they'll, you know, they'll send a private message, you know, or there's someone that they communicate with Microsoft Messenger, or something, all the time.
L:  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  And that person'll find out and then, you know, the next thing you know there's a posting on the board.  Our buddy, so and so, is having some trouble.  Let's pitch in and help 'em out.  And, you know, and a lot of people the only thing they have to offer is a prayer here and there.  
L:  That's right.
R:  And I think that does just as much good.
L:  Oh, I'm sure it does.  Uh, with all the troops overseas and all there was a, uh, site on the web that was, uh, my prayer commitment.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you, uh, I don't know if you've got involved in it or not but --
R:  I didn't see that.
L:  -- you ...  Yeah, well you would adopt the servicemen's family and, uh, all it tells you is his, or his or her name, and first name only, and then spouse and children or what have you.  And everyday you were committed to pray for them.  And, uh, so I, uh -- you could have various names or various ones that you'd sign up for.  So I live in a mobile park and I ended up with something like twenty two names and then I passed them all out to neighbors.  So I felt that that was pretty good.  That we got -- instead of just me, you know, with one then we had twenty two people that were being prayed for that way.  
R:  Oh, that's -- that's awesome.
L:  So ...
R:  And -- and, you know, it -- it does make a difference.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it makes all the difference in the world.  Even if somebody knows that you're just -- you know, they may not have a, you know, a strong belief themselves.  But just, you know, that someone cares about them to, you know, to ask for God to help someone out.  I think it makes a big difference.
L:  Oh, I know.  If you're hurting you want all the help you can get.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whether it's upstairs or next door.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And you -- do you live in a small town?
L:  Uh, [MN] we've got fifty three thousand here.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm much -- we're about five thousand.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  And what --
L:  You're smaller.  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah, and -- yeah.  But I'm sure you have like your community groups and that kind of thing where people --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- gather and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yep, and it's a while -- it's -- it's just amazing to me how, you know -- and I think the words of a lot of that, you know, people really do pull together a lot more now than they were before.  
L:  I think when we get afraid we really start pulling together.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And we -- we finally realize that we're not strong enough by ourselves that we need something more.  
R:  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's like this -- in this town, you know, it's -- I -- I just can't believe it.  Everybody knows everybody and, you know, and the -- and, yes, there are people that battle.  But most people are friends.  And they do get together for the church suppers and that kind of thing.
L:  I -- I can remember that when I was growing up.  I was raised in Missouri and, uh, on Sundays, uh, you went to church of the morning and you went again Sunday night.  And then you go Wednesday night.  And it seems like the whole social life is built around the church and they used to have box suppers and, uh, I can't remember a whole lot because I wasn't that old but, uh, I know that my oldest brother has [MN] is a minister now.  And his son is a minister.  So --
R:  Really?
L:  -- it must've been good training.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  'Cause -- 
R:  -- great.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, there's eight kids in my family and, uh, um, one of my sisters has, uh, passed away but all the rest of us are all still alive and, uh, uh, not everybody stayed on the walk with God but -- but, uh, they're all coming back to it as they get older.  And, uh, so it, uh, I think my brother used say that God answers prayers with yes, no and wait a little while and so, uh, you just hope that, uh, they hang in there you know, un- until you get the answer you're looking for.
R:  Well, one of my -- one of my favorite, um, Bible quotations, and I don't remember which book it's from but it's said, And the Lord said be still.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you -- He has a plan for you and when things are -- He wants something to happen for you it will happen.  And there's not a thing you can do to change it or, you know, and if you try, you know, it just might take a -- a little bit longer before [LAUGH] before it happens.  But --
L:  That's right.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  And I found that instead of asking God to help me with things, now I thank Him for giving me what I have.  It's --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- my friends, my ex fiance's parents have taught me so much that way.  
L:  Well, I'm sure happy for you that you have
