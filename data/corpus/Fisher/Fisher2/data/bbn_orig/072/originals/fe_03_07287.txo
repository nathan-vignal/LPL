L:  Mary.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  How are you?
R:  'Scuse me.  I'm fine.  My name is Lonnie.
L:  Lonnie.  And I'm Mary.  
R:  Hi, Mary.
L:  Hi.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess, um, so restaurants or home?
R:  Well, I can tell you what I'd rather do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'd rather eat out.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  If, uh, it's not a question of money.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I -- you know what, I -- I prefer eating at home.  I prefer making my, um, my own meals.  That's what he does.  That's what the other one does too.  Um, you know, is it just --
R:  So do you like to cook?
L:  Yes, I love to cook.
R:  Oh, that makes a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- big difference.  
L:  Yeah.  It's just -- plus I have a family of five so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yes.  
L:  You know, it -- it -- it causes for shorter wait actually.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Now see I have -- I raised five children and, uh --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and it was, you know, at that time, yes.  Cooking, it was the thing.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think maybe that's another reason why I don't like to [LAUGH] cook anymore.  
L:  Yeah, maybe, well, see I'm -- I'm getting there to where, you know, I -- I think once my -- my kids are gone I'll -- I'll be the restaurant kind of [LAUGH] girl.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So while they're here, you know, I cook every night the square meal, you know.  The meat, the starch, the vegetables and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- make sure they all sit down together and what not.  Um ...
R:  Wonderful.
L:  You know, they got girlfriends and boyfriends that, you know --
R:  Well, at times --
L:  -- with the two older ones so ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, we usually have at least seven for dinner.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh.  
L:  You know.
R:  Hey, that's good.
L:  But, yeah.  And it's fun, you know.  I mean, I like my -- I do my pasta thing and I do a prime rib every now and then and, you know.  Just my own little recipes here and there.  
R:  Oh, I think that's great.  
L:  Yeah.  But I -- and not to say that I don't en- enjoy a restaurant, 'cause I do enjoy a restaurant but ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure you do.
L:  You know.
R:  It's a nice break.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But for a break I like it.  You know, I -- I definitely prefer eating at home.  
R:  Well, I think that's commendable.  
L:  Oh, thanks.
R:  It's really nice to hear somebody that is enjoying it.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I have a sister in law that also loves to cook.  
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  I love -- I love to go to her house.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Better than a restaurant.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh, yeah.  In that case it is.  It's very definitely.  So what type of meals do you prepare?
L:  Um, well, basically square meals.  Um, you know, like the meat, the pasta, the vegetables.  I do a lot of, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a lot of, um, pasta and spaghetti.  
R:  Do you?
L:  I'm Sicilian so I -- I do a lot.  And then --
R:  [several inaudible words].  Yeah.
L:  And then chicken too.  A lot of chicken.  And we -- 
R:  Um, the pasta meals are easier too to put together, aren't they?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  Course the [several inaudible words] --
L:  But usually the chicken I barbecue.  And -- and it --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  Yeah.  Boneless, skinless so it, you know, it cooks pretty quickly.  
R:  So what do you enjoy about going out?
L:  Being waited on.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's almost like a pamper, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is.  It really is. 
L:  Just like being pampered.  It's really nice.  But that's like, you know.  And then to see, you know, that I'll get recipe ideas, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.
R:  That's great.  
L:  Which is, yeah, um, um, I picked up, uh, like when I do a prime rib --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I forget where I had gone.  I think I went to Long Horn and they actually --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they put clove on their prime rib which was --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- really -- really, really nice so I -- I kind of --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- added that to my recipe.  
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] what a great idea.
L:  You know, it -- it was nice with ground clove.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But lots of mashed potatoes and rice and, you know, of course, the fish.  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  
R:  What [LAUGH] what did he say?
L:  That's my six year old.  Um, fighting fish.  He's got fighting fish for pets.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  We don't eat your fighting fish.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  I guess not, mom.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Not exactly what you -- we eat out, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  He's like a little crocodile hunter.  He's got all kinds of reptiles and whatnot around the house so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, good.  
L:  [COUGH]  Any mention of wildlife he thinks you're talking about him.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's cute.  
L:  Yeah.  So, but yeah, other than that -- and then like we camp a lot so, you know, cooking on the grill is ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Is like second nature to me.  You know.
R:  So you -- you enjoy doing that too then?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to the Keys this weekend.
R:  So you're in Florida?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I'm in Seattle.  Well ...
L:  Are you?  Oh, wow.
R:  In the Seattle area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm south of Seattle.
L:  [MN]
R:  'Bout a half an hour.  
L:  Wow.  That's cool.  That's -- I've never -- I was actually born in California.  I never, um ...
R:  Where?
L:  Long Beach.
R:  [LAUGH]  I grew up in Burbank.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  My -- my aunt used to live there.  My mother right now is in Anaheim.  
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  How funny.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  This world is small.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  My stepfather was in the navy so we travelled all over and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I met my husband when I was fifteen in Connecticut.  And we've been together ever since and we moved down where.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's real [inaudible].
L:  I'm on the phone.  [NOISE]  [MN]  [LAUGH]  
R:  That's okay.  
L:  So ...  And now we're just doing our thing.  Waiting for the kids to get old enough to kick 'em out.  Not really.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible].  All right.  
L:  You know.  
R:  It took me a long time.  I'm just -- mine are in their thirties and just finally left.  [MN]
L:  Oh.  
R:  The last one.  
L:  Well I have -- I have a sixteen year old that has made these decisions that, you know, he's not going to school and he's not --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- working and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that's not good.  
R:  No, I know.  I went through that.  
L:  You know, you try --
R:  I wish --
L:  -- and give 'em morals while they grow up and he just seems to have skipped over that whole part of his life.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  I understand that.
L:  You know.  And -- and he's -- he doesn't eat anything.  This kid he, you know, I don't know where he eats.  He must eat over all his friends house 'cause he never eats anything that I cook.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Never comes home for dinner.  I'm lucky if he comes home at all.  
R:  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  
L:  Mm.  You know, but then I got my fourteen year old that's a girl and she's, uh, she's a good girl.  
R:  Well, that -- that's good.  [MN]
L:  So ...  So far anyways.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...  And then my six year old and that's it.  And he's good.  
R:  Oh, good.  
L:  Just very mischievous.  
R:  I'm glad to hear that.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So do you do many of these calls?
L:  Um, actually I've had probably about eight calls.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, most of the time I wait for you -- you know I'll wait for ten minutes for someone else to, you know, how they say --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- they're looking for someone else to connect, so this actually the first one that I've talked on.  What about you?
R:  Um, I've done about three.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And I keep thinking, I have to keep with the subject, I have to keep with the subject.  You talk so long and then there's nothing -- a whole lot more --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- that you can talk about.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um ...
L:  Ten minutes doesn't sound like long until you're at the end of a phone needing to talk for ten [LAUGH] minutes.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm. 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Right.  So, but, um ...  Anyway I guess we've pretty well covered [MN] ...
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Except for, oh, I know what else.  Um, tipping.  How much do you usually tip?
L:  Um, depending on the service, anywhere from ten to twenty percent.  It depends on the service.  
R:  Very good.
L:  You know.  
R:  Yeah.  I do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You can get some pretty bad people.
L:  Yeah.  You know then -- when they're more concerned about the phone call that they're on and talking with their -- their little friends about, you know, what they're gonna do --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- or what they did do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- instead of serving you or if they, you know, give you the wrong meal or -- or whatnot because they're distracted by something they shouldn't be distracted by that.
R:  I agree.  
L:  That's not -- not good with me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  It's not good, period.  
L:  No.  
R:  Really bad business.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  So ...  Yeah, I'm pretty much that way too.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So ...  I've been pretty lucky.  I -- I, um, help a, uh, [LIPSMACK] ninety five year old woman run around on Thursdays to get her hair done and --
L:  Uh-huh.  Wow.
R:  And, uh, she takes me out to lunch as one of the bonuses and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, [MN] where was I going with this?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So I eat out once a week anyway.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At, you know, pretty nice places.  And, um, she's interesting to watch as far as how she tips.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And she's -- she's very particular about, you know, if people help her how much they help.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And I -- I find several things that are very interesting when we're, um, out and about.  I'm on crutches.  
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm disabled also.  
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  And it's amazing how many people are very rude or don't help, you know, will --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible] door or anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We've had more women --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- help us through doors than men.
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  Somebody's in trouble.  
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, [LAUGH] my --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My six year old is drying his hands on my husband's brand new shirt.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, dear.  
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...  Well ...
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I would imagine we're pretty close to our ten minutes.  
L:  Yeah, I'd -- I would think so.  I think we have a couple --
R:  I didn't even look at the clock.  
L:  Neither did I.  
R:  So ...
L:  Have to add -- we were on for a couple of minutes when I did -- when did -- did they tell you right?
R:  Uh, yeah.  They'll tell us when the ten minutes is up.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  So ...  I'm trying to think of other questions to ask or talk about as far as that goes.  [LIPSMACK]  Um ...  Yeah, what's left?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  That's about ...  [LAUGH] That's about it.  I don't know.  
R:  I -- I wonder how many peop-
