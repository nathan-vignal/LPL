L:  Hi.  Good [LAUGH] evening.  How are you?
R:  I'm just fine.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Uh, my name is Holly.  I live near Washington D.C. in Maryland.
R:  I'm Tania.  I live in Kansas.  
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So okay, well, today's topic is friends.  Are you the kind of person that has, um, a lot of friends or just a few close friends?
R:  Um, actually I suffer from agoraphobia so I have no friends.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I only have --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- a couple.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Agoraphobia is a fear of people and public places so I don't leave my house.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I actually understand because my mom has that.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So I know what that's like.  It's pretty difficult.  
R:  Yeah.  I have, um, I have my family and I -- I guess I have a few close friends.  People that, um, I -- I've come to trust and, uh, I spend a lot of time on the computer so I guess those are friends.  I've never met 'em but, um ...
L:  Oh, those definitely count.  I have a lot of --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- um, a big support network on the computer.  I find it easier to talk to people online too.  
R:  Yeah.  Tha- that's -- to me that's safe people because I don't have to meet 'em.  I don't have to worry about being touched or, um, being in crowds or anything like that so ...
L:  Yes, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- understand.  [LAUGH]  Totally understand.  When I was a kid, um, my mom had come down with agoraphobia and it's -- a lot of people just don't understand that it's really difficult, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to go out in public and be in places, so I understand what [LAUGH] you're going through.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it's -- it's not -- I have, uh, I -- I just, uh, I just got my disability.  Um, I have panic disorder with agoraphobia.  And it -- it's not a -- it's -- it's not a real easy thing to live with, especially when you have kids.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I under- -- my mom had a panic disorder also and she, several times, has gone to the emergency room because, um, she'd have like a [inaudible] or something and -- and that would get, you know, pretty scary.  
R:  Yeah.  I, um --
L:  And it's something that you don't even ask for and you know that -- even if you know that you don't want it and it's not logical you can't help it, it's happening.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  My, uh, my husband has taken me to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attacked it's --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- been so bad.  And, uh, on average my heart rate is, uh, right now it -- i- it's on average about a hundred and thirteen beats a minute.  A- and --
L:  Is that --
R:  And that's normal.  Well, it's --it's not normal, but for me that's normal.
L:  Right.
R:  If it's above that it's when the doctor gets worried.  
L:  Does he --
R:  And --
L:  -- ever have you wear a halter monitor or something to monitor?
R:  Yeah, they have a -- I have a monitor I have to wear in the evenings 'cause that's when they're bad.  But it's hooked to my phone line to where if it goes above a hundred and thirty an ambulance automatically comes to my house.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  
R:  And it --
L:  Well, that's good.  At least you know you have that.  But that's tough.  It's, you know, you probably feel nervous about it.  I'd --
R:  Yeah.  It -- it makes the panic attacks worse at times because, um, I -- I know when I'm having a panic attack, and then it makes it worse because I worry about the ambulance showing up and somebody being here with my kids because my husband works nights and ...
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, if the ambulance comes and get me, I have a four year old and a six year old and, you know, who's going to be here with my kids if the ambulance comes and gets me and ...
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And they probably -- they probably are kinda scared like, you know, where's mommy going?  Is she gonna be okay?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you probably are concerned about that which doesn't help the heart rate because ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  It goes up.  [MN]
R:  But I --
L:  I was nervous about ...
R:  I guess I do have a few close friends but as far as, uh, I -- when I was younger I did.  I had -- I had a lot of friends.  
L:  Yeah, I had --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- more when I was younger too.  It's easier I think when you're in school and you're exposed to a lot of people who are your age and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it certainly gets a little harder when you get older and you have a lot of responsibilities and obligations and ...  You know.
R:  And I have the whole trust thing.  I just -- to me --
L:  Did you, um --
R:  -- friendships are too complicated.
L:  Has anybody ever betrayed your trust when you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- were younger and that?
R:  Um --
L:  Was it a ...?
R:  My -- my father's in prison for, um, sexual molestation and rape.  That's a lot of what my, uh, panic disorder and agoraphobia is based from.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, uh, his family has pretty much disowned me.  Um, they blame me.  They say --
L:  It's not your fault, so how could they possibly ...?  That's terrible.  
R:  And, uh --
L:  And you're sitting there trying to heal and they're probably making it worse.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I moved, uh, I moved from Missouri to Kansas to get away from 'em.  They've never met my kids.  Um, it's [MN] it -- it's -- it's a horrible situation.  Um, my brother and sister don't even have anything to do with me.  Uh, my brother says I ruined his life 'cause I took his father away from him.  
L:  Oh, my God.  But it's not your fault.  
R:  And -- yeah.
L:  You can't help it if somebody's [MN] you know, you're being attacked.  I mean, that's literally what that is.  It's -- it took your innocence away and your life and your future and your trust, and you have to deal with that now for the rest of your life and try to heal.  It's not your fault, you know.  You -- it's --
R:  So it --
L:  -- an incredible burden.
R:  It's really hard to trust people when, you know, the people that are -- you're supposed to be able to trust, your family, did all that to you.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  Well, you sound very healthy actually dealing with it.  Because, um, you know, I -- I would -- I'm not even half as good about being able to talk about, you know, [MN] understanding why I am the way I am so at least, um, [MN] it sounds like you're pretty healthy.  
R:  Well, I've had ten years of --
L:  But it must not be easy.
R:  [LAUGH]  I've had ten years of therapy so ...  [LAUGH]  It -- it gets --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- easier.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Only three for me so ...  [LAUGH]  Maybe when I get up there.  
R:  Well, my --
L:  I haven't had a- any experiences like that but, my gosh.
R:  My father's been in prison for eleven years so I've been in therapy for ten.  And --
L:  Was it hard -- was it hard telling the first person when you, uh, knew you had to do it?
R:  Yeah.  Um, when I was sixteen was when I, uh, when I finally turned it in.  It went on for twelve years.  
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And, uh, the only reason I did was to, uh, protect my sister.  I thought he was doing it to my little sister and it turned out he was.  
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And I didn't know any other way to protect her.  Um, I moved in with him.  My mom had custody of me and I moved in with him to try and protect her and that didn't work.  So I finally turned it in.  Because I didn't know anything else to do.
L:  Wow, this is some life story.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you could write a -- a book and help people who are probably scared and struggling and in the same boat, and don't know who to talk too.
R:  I've actually wrote quite a few poems about it and, um, it's in the process of being published.  Um, some of my poems have been published in self help books.  
L:  Wow.
R:  And, uh, I'm in the process of writing [MN] a book, uh, having one published.  It's nothing but my poems.  It's called Open Soul.  
L:  Wow.  If I gave you --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- my email address will you tell me when it's published?  I would love to [LAUGH] buy it.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  I'll give --
R:  Tell me.
L:  -- it to you before they say, "Ten minutes is up".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  But, yeah, I, uh, I entered a contest on poetry dot com and I had a, um, a publisher contact me and say, "Hey, you know, [LAUGH] do you have more?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow, that's incredible.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, here.  Write this down before they come back on --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- cause I don't know how long we've been.  It's, uh, holly.  H.O.L.L.Y.
R:  Okay. 
L:  Russo.  R.U.S.S.O.  
R:  Okay.
L:  At yahoo dot com.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So make sure you let me know [LAUGH] when I can -- when I can read it.  It's really incredible.
R:  Okay.  
L:  You know, I listen to love line on the radio a lot at night.  I don't know if you've ever heard of that radio show?
R:  +Uh-uh.
L:  But they, um, there's a Dr. Drew Pinskey[?] who's a do- a medical doctor and there's a comedian, Adam Corolla, and they both talk to, um, adolescence and, you know, twenties and thirty year olds, sometimes even forty year old people who have, uh, had a hard time, you know, or -- or dating or have love questions, relationship questions.  And a lot of people call up and they have problems with, um, molestation in the house and he gives them lots of good advice, and it's just amazing how common it is and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people don't really talk about it.  
R:  It is.  Um, in the past -- over the past four years we've been struggling with my stepdaughter.  Um, she's, uh, seven and her, uh, her mother's boyfriend has been molesting her and her mother knows it and told --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- her that, um, he does it because he loves her.  And the state that they live in -- they live in the state of Missouri.  We live in Kansas.  And the state of Missouri won't do anything about it because he hasn't physically --
L:  [LIPSMACK] [MN]
R:  -- penetrated her.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  He's only fondling.  And they said until there's physical proof that, um --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- it's only -- it's only her word against his.  And we have six different counselor reports that say, "Yes, it is going on".  
L:  I can't --
R:  That --
L:  -- believe that.  They can't do anything about it?  
R:  A child her age could not make up the stories that she has told.  
L:  Yeah.  Not only that --
R:  Even --
L:  -- but it -- you don't have to have full penetration to have damage.  Gee.
R:  They said even being coaxed by another parent, because that's what they were trying to say at first.  Is because it was a cust- -- they were trying to say it was a custody thing.  And that we were telling her what to say.  And the counselors even said that even a child her age being coaxed, they could not remember the de- -- a child her age cannot remember the details --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- that she knew.  And the judge -- or the prosecuting attorney said "No", and, um, by Missouri state standards until there's physical proof they will not prosecute because, um, there's too much of a chance of it backfiring on them and them getting a lawsuit on them for malicious prosecution.
L:  Yes, but that's terrible.  I'd rather have them --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- suffer with a lawsuit than have a seven year old have to live -- you know, she's -- that's so --
R:  Well, she was three --
L:  -- painful.
R:  She was three the first time she said he touched her.  
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  And she's seven now.  And he's still
