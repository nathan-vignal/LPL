L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi. 
R:  This is Aleisha.  I'm in Los -- --
L:  My name's E- -- oh, sorry.
R:  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  My name's EJ and I'm in San Francisco.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  So, the topic is friends.  
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, one of the things it mentioned was that we should talk about our best friend.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I have two people that I consider as my best friend.  And, um, one of them is a gal that I've been friends with since the third grade and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- [LAUGH] for whatever reason, even though she and me like really don't have a whole lot in common anymore there's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- still some kind of a common bond between us that even though we might not talk for a month or two if we get on the phone it's just like we never lost touch, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, that's really cool.  
R:  And, then, uh, my other friend, um, well one thing I noticed is that, um, after I became an adult I, meaning like after I got out of high school, um, I really didn't seem to develop long lasting friendships with females anymore.  It's like it was very rare that I ever met a female -- met a new friend.  Like in high school I would always, you know, make new girlfriends and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- but then after I became an adult that just sort of stopped for some reason.  Um, but anyway I did meet one -- one lady, um, when I was probably about twenty nine or thirty and she and I are still friends.  We've been -- we've been friends for almost ten years now.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So -- and I seem to have the same connection with her that I have with the other friend.  
L:  Oh, that's awesome.  
R:  So what about you?
L:  Well, I, um, I -- I'm actually with my closest friend right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's in the room.  And, uh, we've been friends for couple a years now and, um, well, she -- I -- it -- it also asked, um -- you know, she and I have been -- and we have a lot in common and some things that are not at all in common.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LAUGH] but we probably talk at least once a day and if we don't we go with --into like a withdrawal.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And, um, yeah, sometimes we only talk once a week and you can tell that we haven't talked in a long time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, and then, yeah --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- so we're pretty close.  And then -- but as far as, um, what the first question was with if, you know, do you have a couple a good friends or do you have lots of friends?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I tend to be the type of person who has -- who knows a lot of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like I only have -- like, and I hang out with all of them and it gets me into a lot of different social situations and different groups of people, but I would consider myself to only have like three or four really close friends that like -- are like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the -- the family that I come back to, kind of, so ...
R:  Right.  
L:  So ...
R:  Um, I would consider myself to be more the type of person to just have a couple of close friends.  Um, and though I am acquainted with a lot of folks, like people that I work with and stuff, I don't really consider them friends al- -- you know, they're my friend but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't go and hang out with them or do things on a personal level with them.
L:  Right.  
R:  So therefore I classify that as acquaintances versus an actual, you know, friendship.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, uh, so I guess I'd be one of those people that just has a few close friends.  Um, I have a friend that is here in L.A. and she has what anybody would consider so many friends.  It's just -- it's like she doesn't meet a stranger.  You know.  She's one of those types.  
L:  Right.
R:  But I'm not that way.  I'm kinda more, probably, a little more withdrawn but, um, I do know that I try more now to, um, like if I meet somebody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think I kind of have a connection with them I'll actually try to make -- make an effort to, you know, make it into a friendship --
L:  Right.
R:  -- versus how I used to be which was I was oblivious.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  To the fact that I r- r- -- wasn't giving it a chance or whatever. 
L:  Right.
R:  So ...  
L:  Definitely.  Yeah, I have -- like I've travelled a lot so I have friends all over the world and, like you were saying, with -- you have friends that you can just pick up the phone and it's like you never stopped talking.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I def- yeah, I definitely find that.  Like with friends in different regions.  Like I can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pick up the phone and we just start where we left off.  Which is really cool.  But ...
R:  Seems like since I moved to California, um, I met this one girl out here and she has since moved to San Diego but she, um, she and I became f- friends.  I met her through, like a work scenario.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, you know, we seemed to connect and everything and then she was like, "Well, let's go out to eat sometime".  And I'm like, "Okay".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, that's awesome.
R:  Yeah.  So I thought that was kinda cool that she was outgoing enough to, you know, do that and then I -- I made another friend since I came to California that is actually a girl that I met on the internet, uh, because I was interested in distance running.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  And she was looking for a running partner.  And that's how she and I got connected and -- and she -- how I knew that she was a -- a friend was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, she came to my house.  We were gonna go out one night and she had no problem coming to my house with her dirty clothes and her makeup and got ready at my house.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And that's when I knew that she was like a real friend.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, definitely.  
R:  'Cause, you know, only the pe- you know, the people that, like, this is kinda like a little thermometer gauge, I guess in my mind, is somebody who -- who'll do that.  They must feel comfortable around you or they wouldn't -- they wouldn't do that.  
L:  Oh, definitely.  
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  So how is it that you decided to do this study?
L:  Oh, well, actually, um, I'm not the [LAUGH] person who signed up.  I'm a [LAUGH] my friend's the one who signed up and she's cutting my hair.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I'm the one who's talking on the phone.  
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, we cut each other's hair.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my goodness.  
L:  That's our close we are.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, what kind of style is she giving you tonight?
L:  Um, she's -- I -- I was growing it out and now I've decided to go back to short so she's just cutting it all off and I'm just trusting her to do that okay.  So ...
R:  Is she a hairdresser?
L:  No.  Neither of us are.
R:  Are you a hairdresser?
L:  No.  Neither of us are hairdressers but we've been doing each other's --
R:  Mm.  Oh, Lord.
L:  -- hair for about a year now.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  That's so funny.  
L:  So ...
R:  Well, that sounds like me and my roommate.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Um, she and I do each other's hair, but n- neither of us have ventured to cut each other's hair.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we've colored each other's hair, and I've done her hair every color from brown to red to black.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And she turned mine orange once.  And so we've -- we've done it all as far as the hair color --
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  -- thing.  And she wanted me to cut hers but her hair was like super thick and I was like, "No.  I'm not --" 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- gonna go there".  'Cause I definitely don't know how to [LAUGH] cut hair.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  She was like  "Oh, come on."
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Just give it a trim.  It's not gonna be any big deal.  Just trim it".  And I'm like [MN].  
L:  Yeah, I hear you.  Yeah, we both have pretty thick hair.  It can get a little overwhelming at times.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So why did you choose to do this study?
R:  Well, my friend, Anne, the one that I told you about the run- --
L:  MM.
R:  -- runner.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  She's always signing up for these kind of things and she sent me the email and said did I want to sign up and I thought it sounded interesting.  I -- I don't know why it appealed to me really, but it just sounded interesting to talk to people from all over the country or wherever they might be.  You know.  On some random topic.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  
R:  So I just decided I would do it.  
L:  That's so cool.
R:  But what else can we say about friends?  So we can --
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- address their requirements.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I'm like sitting here, like, I can't -- I don't know what else to tell you.  I love my friends.  [LAUGH]  But ...
R:  Um ...
L:  But, yes.  Um, okay, why do you love the friends that you love?
R:  Well, my one friend, she's a good listener.  And she -- you know, how you always just need a friend to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] basically -- even when you don't really know what it is that you want to do?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You want somebody to see the good in all the alternatives that you're considering and it just seems like a friend is always there to do that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like to say, "Well, you know.  Um, yeah, I can see where that would be good".  You [LAUGH] know.  And then [MN] so she's -- and -- and that friend is -- I think she's psychic.  She thinks she's psychic too but ...
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  Um, [COUGH] so she's very intuitive.  In -- in -- in the least, she's extremely intuitive about things.  So I just ...  I don't know.  Plus I -- I guess we grew up together.  Like we were children --
L:  Right.
R:  -- together.  And she knows every single thing about me there
