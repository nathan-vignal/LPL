R:  Hello.  My name is Christina Vig[?].
L:  Hello.  I'm Emily Southstead.  
R:  Hi, Emily.  Nice to meet ya.
L:  Nice to meet you too.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Tacoma, Washington.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, Salt Lake City, Utah.  
R:  Utah.  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  How's the weather down there?
L:  Um, right now it's really nice.  It was really hot last week but this week it's been like seventy so not bad
R:  Oh, that's nice.  Nice to cool off isn't it?
L:  Yeah, and it rained today so it's really [LAUGH] nice.  
R:  Oh, good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  How 'bout where you are?  It probably rains a lot more?
R:  [MN]  Last week actually was blazing hot and today it's finally --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- cooled off again.  And I was quite thankful.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, that's really good.
R:  I am not a hot weather person.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Me either.  I do not like the [LAUGH] hot weather.  [MN]  
R:  So, Emily, we're supposed to talk about close friends.  
L:  Okay.  So, okay.  So do you have a lot of -- do you like having lots of acquaintances or ...?
R:  I know a lot of people through my church and stuff, um, just 'cause of the kind of church I go to.  We -- we seem to get -- I've -- I've gotten to know a lot of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I volunteer a lot and stuff.  But I don't have very many -- I have a few really, really close friends.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Just one or two.  Mostly women.  I think the closest friend I have is my husband.  He's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my best friend.  
L:  That's mine too.  
R:  You're married?
L:  Yeah.  Just barely.  We've been married just a month.  
R:  Oh, congratulations.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, thank you . 
R:  Well, that's cool. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  But it -- since we started dating, then been engaged and stuff, it's amazing how I think your friends kind of -- you only keep h- hold on to the ones that are really [LAUGH] important I think because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he becomes, you know --
R:  'Cause there's only so much time in the day and, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Wait 'til you have kids.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] they [MN], I know.  Probably true.  
R:  Got four of them at home and so my time for friends is a lot less.  
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure.  
R:  I have some really good friends that I know -- they've got kids too and so we all understand.  And we know that our friendship will pick up later.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
R:  So to speak. 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those kind of -- like I have friends that I grew up with and we're really close but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, we don't talk -- we talk maybe once a month 'cause we're all spread out and ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, but your --
R:  But you're still close to them, huh?
L:  Yeah, and they st- -- they know like they can call me for anything, you know.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Like that.  So, yeah, it's nice.
R:  So those are friends from like high school --
L:  It's good.
R:  -- and stuff?
L:  From when I was like gr- -- like I went to church [MN] -- to the same chur- church since I was like four so we --
R:  Oh, my gosh.  So you have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some really close friends.  That's awesome.  
L:  Yeah.  It's quite nice.  
R:  I don't -- I don't have any friends from -- I have one girlfriend that I still keep in touch with from college.  
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  But we moved around a lot 'cause my dad was in the air force, so I don't have any childhood friends that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I've kept.
L:  I've heard that families, like, that move around a lot that they become really close, like really close families.
R:  Yeah, the fam- my whole family is all right here.  It's amazing.
L:  Oh, that's really nice.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's true.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is good.  I've got my mom here and it's good for the kids to have their grandma around.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  It's really nice.  
L:  She probably helps out some too.
R:  Yeah.  She does.
L:  That's good.  
R:  So what do you look for in a friend?
L:  Um, I think -- I think if they're trustworthy and ...  [MN]  It -- it takes me a while to really -- like I'll have a lot of people that I'm friendly with or, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But there's just a couple that -- it takes a while I think to really --
R:  Connect?
L:  -- form a close -- yeah.  
R:  That makes sense.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You got to make sure you can trust them with your secrets [LAUGH], so to speak. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not so much secrets for me is -- is just being vulnerable in front of people.  It doesn't come easy.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's gonna have to be somebody I really am comfortable with before I can be vulnerable in front of them.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  
R:  I'm a ...
L:  And even just, yeah, just not being afraid to, if you're silly or ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Just anything like that.
R:  Well, and sometimes your position.  Um, at church I volunteer and like I'm an overseer and stuff and so I -- I have to be a little more guarded for their sake, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I have to be strong for them sometimes 'cause I'm counselling and helping them out and ...
L:  Oh, that's true.  So you need to be someone in their life that's like solid and ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even when I don't feel too solid.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I'm sure.
R:  But God is pretty good.  He carries you through --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- dark moments.  So ...
L:  Yeah, I agree.  And He always seems to put good people in my life, like, when I need 'em and ...
R:  That right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, good.  
L:  Yeah, so ...  But it's good. 
R:  Finds you people you can talk to and -- I did pray about -- 'cause when I -- right after I got married my husband got saved and we started going to this new church and didn't know anybody.  And so I prayed about friends and making friends, and over the last five years God has really blessed my life with some very close lady friends.  Something I'd never had before as a kid.  
L:  Oh, that's really, really nice.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  My family lives in Atlanta.  And I came up here to go to school.
R:  Oh, wow.  So you're a long ways from home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you going to school at?
L:  Um, Brigham Young University.
R:  Oh.  Wonderful university.  I -- now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're called the cougars?  Right?
L:  Yeah.  Good -- good job.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it's because I went to W.S.U. and they're cougars too.
L:  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  You guys are the other cougars.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  We're the other [inaudible].  [LAUGH]  
R:  I have a son that's going to W.S.U. right now.  He's a coug so ...
L:  Oh, wow.  I have there -- I actually have a friend, her mom works there.  
R:  Oh, at W.S.U.?
L:  Uh-huh.  Just doing like, um, I think she's a secretary or ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Something like that.
R:  It's a big university.  Very big campus. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  But she likes that 'cause she says she can take all, like, all kinds of classes or [inaudible].
R:  Oh, yeah.  They've got great curriculum and stuff.  So what are you studying?
L:  Um, well, I've been studying a lot of things.  I can't [LAUGH] decide.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I changed my major five times before I graduated.  
L:  Oh, good.  That makes me [LAUGH] feel a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- little better.
R:  Explore.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, education's the one thing that they can never take away from you.  And these'll be some of the best years of your life.  Where you can just really explore and find out who you are and where you can, you know, make your niche, so to speak.
L:  Oh, that's neat.
R:  Heck, you'll enjoy it.  So have you made a lot of friends in school?
L:  Yeah.  Um, mostly people -- I was just thinking.  People I've lived with, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's really been nice.  And it does --
R:  You almost have to become --
L:  -- take that kind of an atmosphere.
R:  -- friends with them to live with them, don't you think?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or else they're --
R:  To get along.
L:  -- your worse enemy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  It's practice for being married.  Let me tell ya.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although it is nice to, you know, when I clean up a mess it's like mine or my husband's.  It's not like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  Like five girls I'm rooming with or [LAUGH] something like that.
R:  Yeah, that can get really nasty. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it -- yeah.  So that's been kinda nice actually.  
R:  You need to tell the ones --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- whose moms picked up after them.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] Absolutely.  Yeah.  
R:  I get real --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- frustrated with moms like that.  I say don't do that for them.  
L:  I know.  'Cause it makes my life [LAUGH] miserable.  
R:  They need to do it themselves.  And then they'll appreciate the fact that ...
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  I had a roommate last semester.  She's a little crazy.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I tried to form a friendship with her but she -- she wouldn't even like talk to me like [MN], we were roomer mates and I tried to talk to her at night, you know, just about whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she'd never -- she'd just like answer yes and no.  And ...
R:  She's real closed in, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  She's in her thirties though and she just can't figure out like ...
R:  Oh.
L:  She'd just been -- she's in a masters program but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  Probably just focused on her studies too.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Masters programs really take a lot of focus.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  But, yeah.
R:  And she knows you're just going to be there for a little while and then you'll be gone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's [LAUGH] true.  
R:  Some people, you know, that's -- I catch myself doing that.  If it's somebody I know I'm just not gonna know for very long.  A temporary meeting.  I tend not to be as open.  
L:  Oh, I guess that's true.  
R:  I'm a little, you know, superficial, I guess I would call it.  
L:  Yeah.  I guess that's true.  That's a good point.  It's hard for me though.  I guess I did really want to be her friend and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was hard that she didn't want to just because --
R:  What was it about that you attracted you to her?
L:  Well, not -- it was just that she was my roommate and we were gonna be --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- living together, like close.  
R:  So you wanted to make that --
L:  So to me that is important.  
R:  -- connection.  
L:  Yeah.  Like I didn't necessarily want us to hang out all the time or anything like that but just like to talk every now and then, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And get to know each other a little bit.  Just so it's a more comfortable living situation.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But ...
R:  Well, that's kinda how you find out what -- what ticks them off and what doesn't tick 'em off.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  So you can avoid the ticking off part.
L:  [LAUGH]  Exactly
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So ...  But it's good.  I like my roommate now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do ya?  Well, yeah, I hope so.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So how'd you meet him?  Were you friends with him before you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- got engaged or ...?
L:  No, my, um, he was my friends with cousin.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He was going to school out here and then, um, and they were in a writing class together in a writing group.  And she just -- and I just, um, I was in Wyoming working for the forest service.  And I came --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- home -- I came here just to visit her and to spend the weekend with her.  And she was like, oh, well.  I said, I would -- I just want to go on a date.  And she's like, "Well, I have this friend" and so I found her a date and we just went.  
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Just went out.  Yeah.  And it -- we just hit it off and talked all night and --
R:  Oh, those are the good ones.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you talk.  You know, you -- you know.  Got some people who are exploring, so to speak.  
L:  Yeah, exactly.  So ...
R:  So what does he do?
L:  He's a --
R:  Is he going to school?
L:  Yeah, he is.  Um, he's a philosophy major.  
R:  Philosophy, [MN].
L:  And he wants to teach college. 
R:  Wow.  
L:  So ...  Yeah.  And he's brilliant so
