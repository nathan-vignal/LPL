R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name's Candice.
L:  Hi, Candice, I'm Bradley. [NOISE]
R:  Nice to meet you. [MN]
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  Okay, the topic of the day is food.  [PAUSE] Is that what you heard?
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  Okay.  Would you like to start?
L:  Sure.  I guess I like to eat at home better.  I like to cook, [NOISE] so I -- I prefer to do that.  But I guess sometimes it's nice to have someone else do the cooking and the dishes for you.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Do you eat only when you're hungry, or do you comfort yourself with food also?
L:  Ah --
R:  Like, how do you use food?  Are you an athlete or just --
L:  Ah, ex athlete, but, ah [NOISE] I try to -- try to only, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, eat three times a day.  Try not to eat too much. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  'Cause I eat about six meals a day, six small meals.
L:  That's what I used to do --
R:  I try to use it as fuel.
L:  -- when I was really in training. [LAUGH]
R:  What did you say?
L:  That's what I used to do when I was in, ah -- when I used to be, ah, training.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- I used to run across country.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So -- wh- -- ah, what do you do?
R:  I would like to one day run in the, ah, Olympics, track and field. [NOISE]
L:  Oh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wow.
R:  So ...
L:  So I take it you participate in -- in, ah, running sports currently then?
R:  Mhm, yeah --
L:  Well, wh- --
R:  -- I run for my college.
L:  -- what do you run?
R:  Um, I sprint and I do distance running for Trinity [NOISE] College.
L:  For Trinity?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  So you sprint and you do distance?
R:  Yep.
L:  That's different. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'm trying to see which one I'm better at.  [NOISE] So anyway, um, [NOISE] I'm really kind of upset because today I kind of messed up on my diet and I notice that when I eat food for fuel I -- I either go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through with- withdrawal or something, like ... I guess 'cause I'm missing the sugar and I'm missing the salt, and portion has a lot to do with it too.  I don't like the fact that I can't eat as much as I want to.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So I'm really cranky right now.  I'm sick of chicken breasts.  I've had enough chicken to last me a lifetime.  Um, I can't eat fries.  I'm only eating brown rice and, you know, little small potatoes and stuff like that.  Nothing is flavored.
L:  That's hard.  Well, I mean if you use spices, ah, just using spices can make it --
R:  Mrs Dash?  I'm bored to death with Mrs Dash. [NOISE]
L:  Well, there's -- there's a lot of different things that you can do that are fun.  Like one of my favorite dishes to make right now -- have you ever heard of beer can chicken?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Oh, it -- it's actually, ah -- it's actually really good and, ah, the beer, you know, since it boils it's steaming the chicken and the beer acts as a natural meat tenderizer.  I don't know if beer's allowed in your diet or not, but, ah ...
R:  I don't think so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, ah, it actually makes it -- it makes it really good.  And, ah --
R:  Beer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  So -- well, what you do is you take a chicken and you clean it and you put oil on it and then you put the rub on it, which I use.  It's a one to one to one to one mixture of, ah, either kosher or sea salt, ah, black pepper, paprika and brown sugar.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Rub it on the chicken and then you're going to want to take a can of beer, I -- I recommend Killeen's Red, but that's just a personal preference. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, about half to two thirds full and put a little bit of the rub in there also.  Sit the chicken on top of it and you're going to want to put it on like a pie tin.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, if you're going outdoors you want do indirect heat so you don't have the coals right beneath it, but you can even cook it in an oven if you're using a, ah, [inaudible].
R:  That sounds so good.
L:  It is.
R:  You said brown sugar goes on there too?
L:  Yes, uh-huh.  Well --
R:  Yum.
L:  -- you mix it up first before you put it on there.
R:  Oh, okay.  It's like a baste?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, yeah, yeah, a -- a rub.  You take it and, I mean, you -- you, you know, grab a handful of this stuff and you rub it on the -- the chicken.
R:  Okay.  I don't think that will be on my diet, but thanks for telling me.  I'm hungry now. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, you never know, you could always take the skin off first and that -- that, ah, that'll help cut down on the fat.
R:  So what did you eat when you were training?
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Like, did you go through that, the withdrawal and the c- -- the mood swings?
L:  Um, most of the time --
R:  And egg whites.
L:  No.
R:  I'm tired of egg whites.
L:  No, I never ate egg whites.  Um, most of the time I didn't have to worry about it.  Like, when I was in high school and I ran across country, if I gained ten or fifteen pounds during the summer, I mean, I lost it almost immediately once I got back to school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I -- I would run about a thousand miles in the course of the summer but I wasn't what -- during the school year, like when winter was there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I got to school before the sun rose and left after it set.
R:  Wow.
L:  I was running before and after school every day, ah, and -- 
R:  In high school?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's tough.
L:  That was really tough. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, but I got in -- I mean, I was in really good shape.  And then, you know, got to college and didn't do as much, but, you know, f- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it -- and it hurt me because for a long time, I mean, I never -- I mean, I ate literally all the time.  I mean, I was eating steak --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- ice cream, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my God, you're making me so hungry. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I had the worst eating habits in high school.
R:  So, were you just running?  Or did you body build at all?
L:  I w- --
R:  'Cause I'm trying to do that too.
L:  I was running --
R:  That's really why I'm --
L:  -- and then I did eventually get into lifting weights.  I wasn't really trying to body build, but I was just, ah, lifting for, ah, strength and also --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, I was hoping also by lifting that I would avoid some of the injuries that I would get from time to time.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  'Cause that always, you know, sucked.  You know, you get one injury a -- a year if you're lucky and you hope it's not at a bad time and -- and you hope it's one that you can deal with.
R:  How much water were you drinking a day?
L:  Oh, [MN] well, at one time I was -- let's see, I had a thirty two ounce container and I would chug that like six to eight times a day at one point.  But that's not necessarily good.
R:  Okay.
L:  I was drinking a lot of water.  My coach -- we didn't drink soda pop.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, if you were to drink Gatorade you were supposed to drink water until you were full and then you could drink --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Gatorade.  He was kind of a Nazi about that stuff.
R:  So you'll just sip on it.  I didn't know that. [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  [NOISE] My trainer told me I could have Gatorade when I'm on -- like if I'm on a machine or something.
L:  Ah, my coach w- went a little bit to the extremes on some things, but, yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Did it get you a scholarship? [NOISE]
L:  Um, it could've.  I chose to go to the University of Arkansas and --
R:  Good eating habits pay off. [LAUGH]  No, I'm just kidding.
L:  Yeah.  It -- well, I mean, it -- it could've.  But I -- I went to the University of Arkansas and, ah, they have -- as far as men's indoor and outdoor track and cross country goes, the -- at the time, and I think it still is, the -- ah, probably one of the best programmes in the country.  So if you were a native born citizen the best scholarship they would even offer you was a fifty percent.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  So you could be the best runner in the nation --
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  -- but you'd only get fifty percent.  The only people they gave full scholarships to were international students.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  But that's because -- but then again Arkansas is really reasonable.  But I went there and, ah, the coach didn't seem that interested.  I mean, if he'd even that first year said, "Well, I'll let you be like the -- the team manager or whatever" you know, get the water or som- -- I mean, I would've jumped all over it.  But, ah --
R:  [NOISE] Hmm.
L:  -- he was not real receptive.  And then I got involved in ROTC in my fraternity and -- I mean, I really enjoyed college anyway, so ...  I continued to run a little bit while in college but not like I did in [inaudible], or not like I did in high school.  I mean, I was running, you know, probably fifty weeks out of the year.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know, a slow week was doing like --
R:  [LIPSMACK] So --
L:  -- sixty miles.
R:  -- just to tie this back into food --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- so we get credit for the call [LAUGH] um, it sounds like as an athlete you -- you kind of didn't really look -- you didn't focus on food.
L:  No.
R:  You pretty much ate what you wanted to.
L:  I ate what I wanted to.  But there were times when, like I started to get serious and, you know, I'd eat like, you know, turkey sandwich with no mayo on it and, you know, I'd eat carrots and celery as my snacks.  So --
R:  Oh, that's so boring.
L:  Well, yeah.  I mean, at the time I didn't mind.  I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you eat a baked potato with nothing on it, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, that was before everybody put ranch on everything.  So ...
R:  Before what?
L:  Before people started putting ranch dressing on everything.
R:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.
L:  So, but I've -- I've never like -- you know, I never liked sour cream and --
R:  [NOISE] What's your favorite food? [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Um, probably -- um, during college it was definitely cheese fries. [LAUGH]
R:  Cheese fries?  Are you a Taurus? [LAUGH]
L:  I --
R:  I'm a Taurus, I love cheese and potatoes.
L:  Ah, oh.  Libra -- a Libra Scorpio +cusp or something is what I've been told.
R:  Oh, my. [LIPSMACK]
L:  So ...
R:  Ah, what's your least favorite food? [NOISE]
L:  [MN] Cooked vegetables.
R:  [NOISE] Cooked?
L:  I hate cooked vegetables.  I eat -- I'll eat carrots or celery, ah, but I do not like a lot of cooked vegetables.  I'll -- I'll eat cooked potatoes.  I'll eat cooked green beans, um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And anything else that's a cooked vegetable, it r- -- it has to be like al dente.  It has to be lightly steamed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for me to eat it, um, for a couple of reasons.  I mean, if -- if you cook or you boil a vegetable too much, to me it just tastes like mush.  And second of all, I mean, I know that if you boil a vegetable long enough, you pretty much pull all the nutrients out into the water.  So, you'd be --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right --
L:  -- doing just as --
R:  -- that's true. 
L:  Yeah, you'd be doing just as well to drink a glass of hot water.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  So
