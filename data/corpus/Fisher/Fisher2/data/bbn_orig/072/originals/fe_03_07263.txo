L:  I thought you did.  [MN]  Okay, I assumed they were going to connect me with someone that knew what we're -- are supposed to do but I guess not.  
R:  Yeah, this is the first time I ever got a call.  
L:  Too.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Okay.  Maybe we can hang on the phone for eight minutes.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.
R:  [inaudible] [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  What -- what did they say the topic was supposed to be?
L:  Food?
R:  Food?

R:  Um, I got a five month old.  
L:  Okay. 
R:  Little boy.
L:  I thought I -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  He's getting hungry so I had to feed him.  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is not what I thought it was gonna be.
R:  I know. 
L:  Kind of a ...
R:  [MN]  
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]  I figured somebody know what was -- what they were gonna do.
L:  Yeah, I just assumed someone would ask me questions and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'd answer and be done.  
R:  Hm.  [NOISE]
L:  I [several inaudible words] up to you.  
R:  Do what?
L:  It's up to you.  I don't know if you want to carry on with the call or ...
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  I don't care.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [NOISE]  How long do we have to be on here for?
L:  Ten minutes.
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Eight minutes, I think and then you have two minutes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to feedback.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  Maybe -- did you get this off the internet?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, that's what [NOISE] I did too.  [NOISE]  I figured they would call and tell you what's going on.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  Just trying to log into my email and see exactly what that -- what the email said.  [NOISE]
R:  Are you a stay at home mom?
L:  No, I work.  
R:  Do you?
L:  Full time.  Do you stay at home?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  I, uh --
R:  We live with my fiance's parents.  Right now.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  I'm twenty one so ...
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]  How old are you?
L:  I'm thirty three.  
R:  Thirty three?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.  [NOISE]  
L:  Let's see it -- [inaudible] that email.  
R:  [NOISE]  Maybe we're just supposed to talk about food and [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't know.  
L:  At half pregnant I could spend all day talking about --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Do you -- do you get lots of weird cravings?
L:  Uh, a fair bit.  This pregnancy's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- totally different than my first --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one.
R:  Really?
L:  Really weird.  Uh-huh.  [LIPSMACK]  So I -- I haven't been as hungry really with this one.  I was always hungry with my first one and --
R:  That's how I was when I --
L:  -- gained thirty five pounds and --
R:  That's how much I gained.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I was, uh, constantly eating.  I was like --
L:  Uh-huh.  Always eating.  
R:  I didn't get any stretch marks on my stomach but [NOISE] on my legs --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I did.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So I was just like, oh, that's suck so.  It's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- getting hot now and I can't wear a swimming suit without showing 'em so I'm just like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- oh, well.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  All it says is remember the call length is ten minutes and we ask that you speak on the proposed topic for at least eight.  Let's see.  This study -- telephone calls involve participants who typically do not know each other.  Okay.  In real life conversations with strangers often have [several inaudible words].  Okay.  Topics are not only to provide a wide variety of conversation.  Okay.  In your calls please speak on the suggested topic.  Okay.  Well, I was told do you like to eat at home or do you like to eat out?
R:  Uh, I like to eat at home if I'm cooking.  But --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- 'cause [LAUGH] my in laws are from, um, Ecuador so they just -- they cook, you know, different foods that I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they're ki- it's kind of bland food is what -- it's not --
L:  Really?
R:  -- like Mexican food.  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.  I've had Cuban food before --
R:  Do ya?
L:  -- and it was bland.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So it might -- must be similar to that.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, they -- but [MN] they always eat rice and, you know.  [MN]  Rice, like in America it's like steak and mashed potatoes, or whatever.  Steak and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- potatoes.  And there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like, um, rice and pork.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  So if they're cooking you want to go out?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, when I was pregnant I could not -- I would wake up and I'd smell that and I would get in a bad mood 'cause I hated the smell of the seasonings, you know.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Which -- and then I felt bad 'cause she'd cook all this food 'cause I was pregnant but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I [NOISE] wouldn't want to eat it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then -- but now, I mean, I'll eat it and I think it smells better than when I was pregnant but ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Were you sick when you were pregnant?
R:  Um, no, not really.  Um, not very much at all.  Just, I think, probably four or five times I got sick.  
L:  [NOISE]  I was really sick with this one at the beginning.
R:  Really? 
L:  In fact I lost ten pounds.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, wow.  
L:  After I found out I was pregnant.  Yeah.  The doctor, I mean, he -- I was a little overweight to begin with so ... 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I could've stood to lose ten pounds but I hated to do it at that time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I had a friend that did that.  She didn't even look pregnant 'til she was, like, seven or eight months 'cause she was bigger before and then she lost a bunch of weight.  Like twenty five --
L:  That [inaudible] --
R:  -- pounds.  And then, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  'Cause she was puking.  She couldn't keep nothing down.
L:  Oh.
R:  And then -- but the baby ended up weighing like eight and a half pounds.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  They had to take it early [NOISE] like a month early.
L:  Nature takes care of it, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  Yeah.  So do you like to eat out or in or ...?
L:  Oh, I love to eat out.  
R:  Do ya?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  What kind of restaurants do you guys got down there?
L:  Oh, my favorite is probably -- there's local places that I love.  Like we have really good barbecue down here.  And, um, and we have a Mexican restaurant called Rosie's and it's wonderful.  But then we have, like my favorite chain is like Bennigans and, uh, Macaroni Grill.  Do you have that?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  We have like -- we -- I live in Emporia, Kansas, so there's a lot of Mexicans here.  And so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there's a lot of authentic Mexican food places here, you know.  Just like, um, I don't know.  They make everything from scratch.  
L:  Yum.
R:  And so I love Mexican food so ...  It's pretty good.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Except when [LAUGH] their jalapenos are hot.  So --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I try to -- I bit into one when I was pregnant.  It was in some food and I was like, oh, I -- uh, that's when I puked.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  But ...  Mm.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah.  So there's a lot of Mexicans in Kansas.  I'd never guess that.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, we're starting to get a lot more here in -- in, uh, Alabama.  
R:  Yeah.  Well we --
L:  But --
R:  -- have IBP here.  It's like -- it's a meat processing place where, you know --
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  They bring the cows in and kill them and stuff and ...  
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so a lot a Mexicans they'll work for cheaper, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  We have a lot of chicken plants around.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so we've had a boom.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they all work there.  And in construction.  
R:  Yeah.  Yep.  And you find a lot of them -- I was just looking in the newspaper last night and they had, um, they needed a foreman for -- but, you know, speak both languages.  You know, to head up a crew of Mexicans [LAUGH] is what it said.
L:  Wow.  
R:  So, yeah.  Um, what about your baby food.  Does -- do you buy baby food or do you make it?
L:  I bought mine.  
R:  Did ya?
L:  The jarred.  Uh-huh.  And it's 'cause I work so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it was just easier.  It was easier for me.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But I heard -- I've heard of people making their own baby food.
R:  Yeah.  I was -- well, I started feeding him rice cereal like, um, a month ago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And putting in -- in some of my breast milk.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, he doesn't -- he doesn't seem to like it at first but [MN] 'cause it's bland and you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- breast milk's kinda sweet so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, but I was thinking about starting him on some food but he -- I don't know, he can't -- they can't swallow very good --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- at five months so ...  Like they just spit everything out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ...
L:  They get the hang of it.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  And then -- well, and then after -- after a while they start getting teeth and stuff, you know.  I -- I pushed table food on him just as quick I could.  
R:  Yeah.  We --
L:  'Cause I hated [MN] having to buy all those little jars of baby [LAUGH] food.
R:  Yeah, I -- no -- no kidding.  They get so expensive, don't they?
L:  Oh, you -- you buy a -- a basket load and then three days later you got to go back and buy more, you know.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause they don't just eat one every meal.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's two or three.  
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But some of that I wouldn't even feed to him.  He's a -- well, like the beef stew, or [LAUGH] whatever.
