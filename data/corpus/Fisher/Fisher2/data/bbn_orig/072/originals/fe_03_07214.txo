R:  Hi, I'm --
L:  Hello. 
R:  -- Katy.
L:  Hi, I'm Missy.  
R:  Hi, Missy.  Where are you from?
L:  Uh, Jackson, Mississippi.  Where are you from?
R:  Um, Madison, Wisconsin.  
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's a long way away.  
R:  Other ends of the country.
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, so, friends.  Um, [LIPSMACK] you go first.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, well they -- they -- they -- they said that the question was, or one of them was that do you have just a couple of close friends or lots of acquaintances, and I think I kind of have both.  My [MN] -- if -- if I were to ask you who my closest friends were I would have to [MN] you know, a couple but at the same time, like, there are quite a few people -- like I was actually making a list because I'm moving in two weeks and I'm gonna have one last party and, um, you know, that there were like twenty five people that I came up with without a problem that live nearby.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So ...
L:  Um, I guess I'm kind of the same way.  I have [MN] a lot of friends from a lot of different places.  Like I lived in one city, you know, growing up and I have a bunch of high school friends that I still keep in touch with.  And then I went to college in a different city --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I have a bunch of friends there that I still keep in touch with.  And then I'm in law school right now and I have a bunch of friends there that I'm sure I'll keep in touch with.  So I guess I have a lot.  [MN]
R:  What cities were-- did you have your [inaudible] in?
L:  Um, Shreveport, Louisiana, is where I grew up and then --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, Jackson, Mississippi is where I went to college and I'm in law school in Oxford.  And then --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I'm just here for the summer.  But, um, I'm li- actually I'm living with a friend this summer, uh, while I'm working.  She's one of my college friends and my law school friends.  
R:  So that's been working out living together?  I know sometimes living with your friends can be a little bit of a challenge.  [LAUGH] 
L:  It really can.  I -- it's been fine.  She's actually married and, you know, they -- they kinda do their own thing and we get -- well, I guess, we kinda all do stuff together a lot of the times but it really has worked out well.  I wor- I lived with her last summer too.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, last summer we all lived in a two bedroom apartment and, with her brother as well, so it was four of us in a two bedroom apartment and I slept on the couch and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I guess if that worked out [MN] we -- we're -- we're pretty good [LAUGH] friends.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  No, that's good.  I'm glad for [LAUGH] you.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  I've had both -- I've had both ends, you know.  I had a frie- -- one of my best friends in college, we lived together for two years and we never fought.  There was like one night we got pissed off with each other but we never actually, like, had it out.  We just, you know, let it roll, uh, a couple minutes later.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But then I lived with some acquaintances, um, my senior year and that didn't work out at all because we didn't, you know, they didn't value me enough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to [MN] include me in decisions that would change the dynamic of a household a lot.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Yeah, I understand what you're saying.  But then again, uh, I remember my mom saying that I should never, ever live with a really good friend 'cause it would just be too, I don't know, too much together time and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we'd get on each other's nerves too much.  
R:  Yeah --
L:  But ...
R:  -- I think that [MN] -- I -- I think that that can be the case often enough.  What was good about my friend, and I was -- we were able to always come home to each other but we, you know, we also had separate friends, and I was very involved with other friends outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of our [inaudible] close circle.
L:  Yeah, I guess that makes a difference.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- how long have -- how long have you been in law school?  Have you been able to make -- keep -- keep friends while going to law school or is it kind of hard?
L:  Yeah.  No, it's -- it's -- it's not that hard 'cause the, um, the city -- Oxford, Mississippi, is a really, really small town so everybody lives pretty close together and there's only a couple of places to go out and stuff at night so everybody kind of goes out to the same places and it's -- so I guess that's where the acquaintance thing comes in too.  I have, you know, I have a bunch of good friends but then I also have a whole bunch of acquaintances that are fun to hang out with and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- see out and talk to but then, I mean, they're people I don't really call on the phone to go do stuff with or anything.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  But, um, but yeah ...  And -- and several of my friends from college actually went to law school up there so that was good, and that gave me just a little group a friends at the beginning to get to know other friends [several inaudible words] 'cause it's so hard to make friends but when you're by [LAUGH] yourself ...
R:  Right.  Yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- sometimes.  But then that can be good because then you don't know anybody you don't necessarily have --
L:  You have to [LAUGH] ma- -- [LAUGH] you have to.
R:  Yeah, you have to make it and you don't have the same biases that your -- your friends do, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  As to who you're gonna hang out with.  
L:  That's true.  
R:  Yeah.  I definitely have, you know, and then I, uh, I also have a group of friends, yeah, like you said, like I would see 'em out and we'd have a good time together for, you know, doing an activity together and we'd see each other.  I would consider them my friends but friend is such a broad word, you know.
L:  Yeah.  It really is.  I mean, I have friends that I could call and sit -- tell them anything and do anything with 'em and, yeah, they'd always be my friends forever and I could go, you know, years without talking to 'em, which I probably wouldn't 'cause they're [MN], you know, good friends but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it would be okay, and then there's friends that I'm not so sure about.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, how long -- what's your longest friend?  How -- what's your friend that you've been friends with the longest?
L:  Um, well, I guess, there's a girl that I've known.  We were born twenty five days apart and we were in the nursery together.
R:  Oh, yeah?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, and -- and we're still friends.  I mean, we don't talk as often as I do with s- some of my other friends but, I mean, everytime I go to Shreveport and, you know, every once in a while on the phone or email or something we talk.  But she lives --
R:  [several inaudible words]. 
L:  -- in Texas now and I'm in Mississippi, so it's not --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- very often that we see each other.
R:  Yeah, it gets hard.  
L:  Yeah.  What about you?
R:  Do you find [MN] -- do you find it hard to keep contact with friends that, you know, when you're not around 'em.  Like a- are your friends -- are your closer friends still good about, you know, calling you or emailing you, or whatever, when you're not necessarily around them?
L:  Well, the ones that I'm, you know, the closest too I can't not to talk to 'em and stuff 'cause, you know, on a daily basis I have stuff that I need to tell 'em.  You [LAUGH] know.  Like just anything that goes on.  
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  And --
R:  -- true.  
L:  And then -- but there are some friends that I'm just -- that, you know, it is hard and I think email is wonderful for that.  It's not as personal, I guess.  But --
R:  Yes.  But I don't know --
L:  It's easy.
R:  -- I think it's what you make it.  You know.  
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  I don't know.  Ever- -- yeah, it is --
L:  Yeah, it definitely makes it easier.
R:  -- not quite the same as hearing voice inflection but at the same time if you've been friends with them for a really long time I think they know how to read it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  
R:  Yeah.  I have a friend --
L:  So what about your oldest friend?
R:  My oldest friend, um, that I -- that I made on my own, that just wasn't part of a family friend.  I'm getting married in August and my maid of honor's my cousin but that's, you know, because we were related but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at least, you know, stuck around and hu- hung out but my oldest friend is eleven -- eleven months younger than I am and our parents are friends back from middle school.  Um --
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  But we, you know, our families would get together but, you know, we would just do it out of obligation, but then when we were in high school we realized that, like, we're just like sisters.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have so much in common and the same things that we were, you know, just clicked on and -- and so we've stayed friends and, you know, it's kind of -- it's been hard because we both are very busy and in different cities but--
L:  Oh.  Where does she live?
R:  She lives in Milwaukee.  It's not that far away and I'm from Milwaukee but, um, [MN] you know, the -- it's still just the both -- you know, you're busy and everything.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we also had the kind of friendship that we can pick off and pick up where we left off very easily so ...
L:  Yeah.  That's -- I guess, that's the true test is if -- it's just like it -- and -- and you never left each other, whatever.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.
L:  So, congratulations on getting married though.  [MN]  So do you --
R:  Thanks.
L:  -- have a lotta bridesmaids?  Friends that are in your wedding and stuff?
R:  Um, I have four total.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and it was actually more because -- not because I don't have a lot of girlfriends but I wanted to have, you know, when I was like -- I always wanted three.  I was like let's just do -- let's keep it small but then my, um, fiance had four guy friends and he couldn't choose between them so like I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- of course -- of course, not a problem.  [LAUGH]  And then he's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- got, you know, his guy friends are ushers too.  I find it funny because usually it's the girl who can't decide and they're, you know, quick --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- scrambling to find guy friends to fill it in. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  So was it hard to decide?  Like choosing [MN] --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- one friend over another?
R:  [MN]  For a while, uh, like I, you know, [MN] like a couple of years ago it would have been a lot harder but at this point in my life, like I -- the friends that I'm closest too w- wouldn't, you know, feel bad that -- that I'm choosing one or the other, kind of a thing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Fortunately[?].
R:  So that's kind of -- and part of it though was I went with my cousin because I'm really good friends with her but, you know, it's easier to say she's family [LAUGH] so then I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can get away with, you know, not picking her --
L:  Actually, I'm glad I --
R:  -- over friends.
L:  Yeah.  I'm glad -- I have a sister who, when I get married, she's gonna be my maid of honor, and then I guess that's easier than trying to pick a friend.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And say -- try to explain or whatever.  Though, um, that just reminded, you know, [MN] I used to have, you know, I had a list -- for the past several years I've had a list of, you know, eight or ten people and I've been able to cross off people just knowing -- 'cause I guess the further removed you are from where your friendship was, you know, who your really, really true good friends are.  
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Just, you know, you -- and like in college I would've thought, "Oh, all these people are my great friends", and I still keep in touch with a lot of 'em but I know who my -- my true good friends are.  So ...
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, and that -- that's what made it easier because I'm finally at that point, you know.  I've been graduated for a year now so, you know, I'm -- I have kinda -- you know, the -- my real friends and I keep in touch, although one of my best friends is a guy, you know, so it's kind of
