L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Good.
L:  My name is Malea[?].
R:  Hi.  My name is Kilson[?].  I live in Connecticut.
L:  Oh, in Connecticut.  I'm in California.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, we're on opposite ends of the [LAUGH] country.
L:  Yeah.  We certainly are.  So our topic to discuss is would we rather eat -- do we prefer restaurants over home cooking?
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  I think that depends on what day of the week it [LAUGH] is.
R:  Yeah.  I think at this point I covet the idea of eating out because I have a three year old and a five year old and my husband and I never get out to eat somewhere.  Actually we did just the other week and we hadn't done it in -- in over a year and -- and we just enjoyed it so much and thought, my gosh, why haven't we done this more often.  It just seems -- it seems so heavenly to have someone serve you the food and not have to worry about the dishes afterward and --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  -- wiping faces and ...  Yeah.
L:  Especially with having two little ones.
R:  Yeah, and the criticism, you know, I don't --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- like it.  I don't want --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it.  So ...
L:  [MN]
R:  But, you know, I normally am someone, I just -- I prefer home cooking.  I -- I don't care for restaurant food per se but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think just the experience of being out of the house and not being responsible for preparing the meal was just -- it was so heavenly this time that I feel sort of conflicted about [LAUGH] how to answer.  So, um, I'll --
L:  I think I share though some of the same concerns actually.  My children are a lot older.  They're, um, eighteen and twenty.  And both of them are actually getting ready to move out of the house.
R:  Oh.  [MN] 
L:  And go on to college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, as much as I am to the point where I'm exhausted as far as cooking goes because we've sorta got an old fashioned value here where we like to eat dinner together.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it doesn't always work out, but I'm actually to the point now where I think I prefer, at least, you know, being able to go out at least once a week to a restaurant.  And it's -- I think it's just because it's been so many years of preparing meals.  And it's funny because I thought I'd never hear myself say that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I think I'm to the point in my life now where I really prefer eating in a restaurant. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  As much as I love home cooked food.  
R:  Yeah.  My mom was --
L:  It's the same as you.  I don't want the hassle anymore.  
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, you know when I grew up my dad was a severe diabetic and so my mother had to, you know, weigh everything and he needed specific foods everyday so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for us it was almost, you know, we -- we virtually never went out to eat simply because my dad's diet was so restrictive.  Plus my mom grew up in Europe during the second world war and the attitude that my parents had was that, you know, you eat food to survive.  And you should be grateful for whatever you have on your plate every night so, you know, the emphasis was that food was more for sustenance.  Um, there wasn't -- you know, although for holidays and so forth there was very much a sense of celebration but there was, you know, we always ate at home and this prospect of maybe eating out, you know, was just, you know, it was -- it was so infrequently and when we did go somewhere it -- there, you know, the menu had to be scrutinized so closely and had to figure out what in the world my dad could -- could safely eat.  And everything was -- had to sort of be a little different from the way it was on the menu.  So it wasn't even -- it wasn't even a pleasurable thing because it just seemed to be so hard for my dad to, you know, get something that he could truly enjoy [COUGH], you know, safely.  So, you know, we -- we sort of had a very frugal sensibility about, you know, eating, you know, you eat at home and -- and the restaurant was only something that you very rarely ever do.  I think nowadays it's more families just generally do this more of the -- it's more of a lifestyle.  It's -- it's, you know, it's more expected that families, you know, go out and eat on a regular basis and this -- restaurants are so geared towards serving families now that it seems to be much easier, uh, to eat out as a family.
L:  And they do now cater to special needs as far as diabetic and low --
R:  Right.
L:  -- fat.  And --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- vegetarian and things like that.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Whereas, you know, years ago there was no such thing as special meals.  I mean --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- you ate what was on the menu and that's all there was.
R:  Yeah.  So that's --
L:  So ...
R:  -- that's very true.  There's a lot of people that have various types of diets like the Atkins diet where it's, you know, all protein and -- and the restaurants have really adapted towards accommodating people more so, you know, back when my dad was alive it was pretty much this is what we have buddy.  You know, yeah --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- we can -- we can keep the mayonnaise off of it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but don't, you know, don't expect us to do much more than that.
L:  Right.
R:  So, uh ...  You know.  [MN]
L:  Times have definitely changed, haven't they?
R:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.  And I think eating, I don't know, maybe we've -- this pendulum has swung just a little bit too far to the other side but you said a little while ago that your parents grew up in -- or you mom grew up in Europe and eating was basically for sustenance.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  It was to stay alive.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Now I think our attitude is that people live to eat.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's -- it's -- it's very much seen as a recreational --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- activity and a lot of these -- these restaurants are seam[?] restaurants and -- and, yeah, and even the decor and -- and -- and the, you know, th- th- the brands that -- the representation, you know, like the Chuck E Cheeses and the Ronald McDonalds.  
L:  Mm.  Mm.
R:  They have all these characters associated with them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to try and, you know, make eating seem like, you know, an entertaining experience.  So, yeah, it's definitely -- it's not, you know, you just go to a, you know, a dimly lit dining --
L:  No.
R:  -- room anymore.
L:  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, uh --
L:  No.  No.
R:  It's very much about entertainment now and, uh ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's fun for the kids and it certainly makes it appealing.  It makes it appealing to them.  So, uh, but my husband and I, you know, we -- we generally get home from work and it's, you know, we try to have a meal mentally planned and we try to just, you know --
L:  Get through the night.
R:  -- like you do.  Try to --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- sit down -- try to sit down as a family and sort of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- reacquaint ourselves with one another.  
L:  Mhm.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So ...
L:  Find out exactly, you know, uh, what when on with each other's days.  
R:  Right.  Right.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because we both work it's hard to catch up.  It's kind of hard to sort of like catch up with everyone and find out what everybody was up to and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  It's sort of like the meal at home now is almost like your only opportunity to really communicate.  At least for our family, um ...
L:  Well, it is when you've got two parents working and young children.  We went through the same thing.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  It was just like there never seemed to be enough time and the rare occasion that we would allow ourselves to go out without our daughters, um, was, oh, my gosh, just the two of us.  [LAUGH] What do we now?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  And then what do you do?  You end up talking about your kids.  
L:  Talking about the kids.  Of course.
R:  I mean, that's we do.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I know.  Well, now part of -- they also asked that we describe our perfect meal.
R:  Yes.
L:  So do you want to go ahead and ...?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Let's see.
R:  I think the immediate thing I thought of was a plate of artichoke hearts.  You know, I thought in terms of [LAUGH] what --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what one thing can I never seem to get enough of, um ...?  Well, right now I am on the Atkins diet so I think -- I think when I think of a perfect meal [LIPSMACK] I think of some enormous plate of pasta that has, you know --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- artichoke hearts and olive oil and prosciutto ham and things like that mixed into it.  Uh, uh, I don't know if they mean to describe the setting and everything, but again it would have to be in a setting where it's just my husband and myself having a quiet evening away from, you know, the kids and away from the -- the stresses of home.  So it wouldn't be, you know, at home in our -- in our dining room.  It would be somewhere in a-- in a lovely setting.  Um, or in desperation it could be at a clam shack along the shoreline for goodness sake. 
L:  [LAUGH]  There you go.
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.  
R:  I -- I mean I love food and -- and it wouldn't be hard for me to sit down and have a meal and -- and me think that it were, you know, the perfect situation so ...  How 'bout you?
L:  I don't know.  I -- I tend to always te- -- uh, go towards some elaborately prepared salmon because I just love --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- salmon.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the whole time my kids were growing up, everytime I'd cook it, it -- and -- and it's so easy to cook.
R:  Right.
L:  They used to have a fit because it would smell up the house.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  "Mom, the house stinks and I've got friends coming over".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  So I stopped cooking salmon except when I'd throw it on the grill in the backyard.
R:  Right.
L:  So when we go out to dinner it's like I can't help it.  I just have to order [LAUGH] salmon.  
R:  I -- yes.  I try to order something that I can't easily make at home.  
L: At home.  Yeah.  
R:  Something that's got, you know, we -- we -- we love salmon too.  And we have the same problem.  Unless -- unless it's made out on the grill.
L:  Yep.
R:  And here in Connecticut it's been raining almost continuously --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for the last month so it --
L:  Gosh. 
R:  -- it's -- unless you fancy doing it under an umbrella you don't really venture outside to do any cooking. 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, yes, uh, salmon [NOISE] and all kinds of [MN] my daughter's doll.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, we love to make any kind of fish and we try smoking it outside too so that, yeah, that is something that I would consider an enormous treat.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, uh, food in general when I -- and when they mentioned today that food was the topic I thought, "Oh, my God.  I could talk forever about ..."
L:  About food.
R:  I could talk forever about food, what I like --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and, you know.
L:  Well, what do you think about -- this is a little off the subject.  But speaking of food.  What do you think about this?  I -- I heard that there was someone that was actually trying to file suit against McDonalds because they were grossly obese?
R:  Yes.  
L:  And they were -- they were blaming it on the super size.
R:  Ridiculous.
L:  I know.
R:  Ridiculous.  I think, you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- again, it's -- it's people not taking personal responsibility.
L:  +Responsibility.
R:  -- for their actions.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  You know, that -- that -- and it's just like the hot coffee, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- suits and, uh --
L:  Well --
R:  And the guy who wants a -- the -- the guy who was, uh, taught -- trying to s- sue Oreos over the transfat.
L:  Oh, the transfatty acids.  Ri-
