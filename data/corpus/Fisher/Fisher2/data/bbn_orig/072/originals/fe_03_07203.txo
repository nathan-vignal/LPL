R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Chrissy.  I'm in Louisiana.  
L:  Hi.  My name is Teri and I'm in New Jersey.  
R:  Oh.  Well, that's interesting.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Quite a variety.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.  [MN]
L:  So do you have a lot of friends?
R:  Um, not a whole lot that I would consider close friends.  But I have several.  You know.
L:  Yeah, well I think it's interesting that they made a distinction between friends and associates or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, because I have quite a few associates.  People that I consider associates but when it comes to true friends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I could on- -- I really can say I have three or four of them.  And to me that means people that I know will be there for me when I need them.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And they know they can count on me to be there for them.
R:  Yeah.  I probably have six, I guess.  And I -- I mean I have friends from church but they're not people, like I -- I say, you know, I just can't just call 'em up and say, "Hey, you want to go to the movies or something?"
L:  Right.
R:  They're not that type of friends.  I do hang out with them sometimes but anyhow they would be there if I need 'em but more because of the church [LAUGH] association than -- than our friendship, you know.  But, um, yeah, I have about six good friends, I guess.  I've one that I've known since fifth grade.  [LAUGH]  It was interesting.  I -- I grew up in, um, North Louisiana.  Kind of a small, not real small, but, you know, rural town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And moved away for twenty years and, you know, kept in touch for -- with her for quite a while during that period but then lost touch with her completely and then moved back, you know, over twenty years later and we just kind of picked up where we [LAUGH] left off.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We're best friends again [LAUGH] so ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] funny.
L:  Well, that's always nice and -- and that's when --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know you had a true friendship.
R:  Yeah.  And basically that's the only good friend I have in North Louisiana.  I've been here five years and all my friends are still down in South [LAUGH] Louisiana.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Except for her.  You know.
L:  Well, I have -- I have really good friends.  One I been friends with since first grade.  She's four days older than I am.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We went through school together and we've always been close.  I mean, my parents were like her parents and vice versa.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I have another friend I met my first day of college.  And she is like a sister to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I have another friend I met right after I moved to New Jersey thirty some years ago.  And we are best friends, like sisters.  So I really feel like I'm fortunate because I do have these people.  I've had a lot of, uh, illnesses and deaths in my family in the last few years.
R:  Mm.
L:  And that's when I found out who my true friends were.  Because they were there at all times.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not just when it was convenient for them.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I knew I could pick up the phone and call them anytime of the day or night and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would be there for me.  As soon as they found out something had happened they were here.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And that's when you know you really have a true friend --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- that can see you at your worse.
R:  Right.  
L:  And still love you.
R:  Yeah.  I have some friends like that but I didn't meet them until I was around twenty, when I started taking a dancing class.  And, um, you know, the -- this was twenty two, twenty three years ago and we've remained close through all this.  And th- there's three of them more like [LAUGH] sisters.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They help.  You know.  And all different ages and -- and everything and, uh ...
L:  And it's really, you know, it's -- it's really what keeps me going.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, when I lost my husband last year I was totally devastated.  
R:  Oh, I imagine.
L:  But, m- my friends, and like I said, most of my really close friends are -- are like family.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and I mean --
R:  Mine too.
L:  And it -- it -- they were there.  I mean, it -- they were there for me.  I could cry with them.  I could scream with them.  I could just go crazy because they were willing to accept me for what I am.
R:  Right.  
L:  And for what I was going through and let me react to it the way I needed to react to it.  Whereas some of the people that I associate with were constantly saying, "Well, you know, you need to get over it.  You need to move on".  
R:  Yeah.  That -- and some of 'em just avoid you because they don't know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how to deal with it.  I know, my -- my best friend, um, right after I moved back here, um, it was -- I guess a little less than a year later her husband committed suicide.
L:  +Oh.
R:  And, I mean, she -- she's still, you know, five years later just devastated.  Or four years later.  You know.  And it -- she lost a lot of friends over that because they just don't know what to say to you and they don't know how to be around you after you've gone through something like that.
L:  And, you know, I think it's interesting because I had people that I thought were friendly associates.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That I thought would be there for me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That I never heard from.
R:  Right.
L:  Not even a card.  And then when I would run into them they would say, "Well, I didn't call because I didn't know what to say". 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's why Hallmark is there.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  If I had just --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- gotten a card --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- with your name on it at least I would've known they were thinking about me.
R:  Right.
L:  But not to call because they didn't know what to say?  Not to send a card?  I mean, it really -- it really hurt me.  And, like I said, that's when I really found out who my true friends were.  And who were people that I would call people I associate with.  You know, I may occasionally have dinner with them.
R:  Right.
L:  Or catch a movie with them.  Or run into them somewhere.  But in terms of knowing anytime of the day or the night I can pick up the phone and call and they'll be there for me.  I found out who those people were.  
R:  Yeah, you do when you go through something bad.  Uh, you really find out who your friends are.  
L:  And on the flipside, when I was getting married and planning my wedding, I also found out that some of the people that I thought were close friendly associates weren't as close as I thought they were --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they weren't as understanding about some things.  Like I can't invite everybody to the wedding.  
R:  Right.
L:  We're having a small intimate family wedding, and there were people that actually got mad because I was not inviting them to the wedding.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whereas other people said, "Look, I truly understand.  I know, you know.  I just want to let you know that I'll be thinking about you".  And that meant a lot to me.  
R:  I'm sure.  [MN]
L:  But, you know, there are -- and there are different levels of friends.  Even when it comes to friends.  I've always felt there were different level of friends.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  There are.  It's like I said, my -- my friends from Georgia.  If I needed anything they would jump right to it, you know.  But, yet, I don't consider them really close friends that y -- you know.  I mean, they're not people I call up to talk about my problems with.
L:  Right.
R:  And things like that.  But, yeah, you know, if we get together in a group, yeah, we do talk about our problems.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We go out.  We have girls' night out once in a while or ...
L:  And there are people that --
R:  Parties or something.
L:  I -- that we share common interest.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like we -- we like a good concert or we enjoy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, going out to a flea market but, like you said, those -- those are people I enjoy spending time with but I would not confide to them personal information.  I wouldn't talk to them about a lot of things that I didn't want to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- get back a- all over [LAUGH] town.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I enjoy being with them.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  You know.  We can really -- I mean, there are people -- I have girlfriends and guy friends that -- I'm a football fanatic.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So during football season, you know, we're from one person's house to the other.  But if I were having a problem I wouldn't discuss it with them.  
R:  Right.
L:  When it comes to sport, fine.  We can talk [LAUGH] about it all day.
R:  Yeah.  I'm not a football fan but that's something I really miss.  I had close male friends in New Orleans and I worked at the New Orleans Convention Center.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I had a couple of real close male friends.  I went to lunch with 'em and stuff like that.  And I don't have any male [LAUGH] friends here.  And I really miss that.  
L:  And, you know, it -- it -- it's interesting because I have a very close male friend.  He's -- he's like the best male -- male friend that I have.  I have two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the first one introduced me to this one.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And it's really interesting because, you know, he'll come by and we will sit here and talk and watch TV and debate and people are like, "Oh, yeah, right.  There's nothing going on".  And I'm like, there isn't. 
R:  Yeah, I know people --
L:  He --
R:  -- talked about us 'cause we all went to lunch together everyday.
L:  Right.  I mean, like --
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- he came by yesterday because my --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- other male friend, his birthday was today and I wanted to go to the cemetery and put flowers on the grave yesterday.  So the other one came.  He said, "Look, we'll go together and we'll put the flowers on".  Then we went to get something to eat and we came back.  But people just can't understand how you can be -- how you can say you're good friends with a man and there's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- nothing sexual --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about it.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And I -- I really don't understand why people are like that.  And my husband was very understanding of the fact.  He had a lot of women friends.  I had a lot of men friends.  And people didn't understand how he could understand me being friendly with men.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or how I could understand him being so friendly with ladies.  And I said --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "You know, it comes down to a matter of trust".  
R:  Right.  
L:  And understanding how important friendships are to people.  
R:  Right.  And you should have friends of all colors, shapes and sizes and both --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sexes, you know.  
L:  Right.  
R:  I mean, that's what makes life interesting.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, 'cause sometimes there are things that you just need to talk to a male friend about.
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, if -- and it's really been great having that sounding board there for me.  And even when my husband died, I mean, there -- there just came a point I just needed a man.  I needed to feel a man's arms around me.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I knew I could go to this friend and he would put his arms around me and he would comfort me, and I knew I could trust him to do it and not take advantage of the situation. 
R:  Right.  
L:  And that was really good.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that really helped me to make it through.  I can sit and talk to him about what I was feeling about missing my husband and -- and some of the emotional things that I was feeling that probably only a man could understand.  
R:  [NOISE]  +Oh, sorry about [LAUGH] that.  
L:  That's [LAUGH] okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, you know, I think it's really import
