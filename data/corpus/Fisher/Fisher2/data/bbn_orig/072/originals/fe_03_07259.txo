L:  Hello, this is Bill.  I'm in Alabama. [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Hi, I'm Dorothy.  I'm in Illinois.
L:  Oh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where at in Illinois? [NOISE]
R:  Ah, just about, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- two hours from Chicago, Bloomington.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I know it well.
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  [NOISE] Yes I do.  I lived up in Rockford for a while.
R:  Oh, well, that's kind of nice.
L:  [NOISE] I lived there for about a year.
R:  Oh.  Well, you know, most people either know where we are or they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- say, "What?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the topic today is easy.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Ah, it certainly is for me.  Um --
R:  It is for me.
L:  Which do you prefer?  Um, eating in or eating out?
R:  Well, it's about half and half.  Sometimes I get very tired of cooking and then I say, "We're going to eat out".  You go on vacation, eat out for a week and you say, "Uh-uh, I want to stay home".
L:  [LAUGH] I can relate to that in a way.  Well, there's not too many, ah -- we- we're a population of about, ah -- about forty thousand I guess.  And oddly enough, there's not that many really good [NOISE] places around town to eat, so, um --
R:  Oh, Bloomington has everything.
L:  [NOISE] Well do [inaudible] --
R:  Two of everything.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, we got --
R:  Some of 'em, three.
L:  We got a lot of restaurants, but not many of 'em are that good, so ...
R:  Oh, well, now here we have everything from fast food to just really good.
L:  [NOISE] Um, we've got one good pizza place in town.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, I -- I have eaten all over the country and it is the finest pizza I've ever put in my mouth, this little [NOISE] mom and pop's operation.  They do a great pizza. [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, it's a couple of --
R:  Well --
L:  Couple of times a year, [NOISE] um, I'll eat there 'cause it -- it -- although it is very good, it's very expensive too.
R:  Well, they probably -- if it's a mom and pop operation, they probably use only the very best ingredients.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  And it's a -- it's a small place and everybody knows it's so good that they can adjust the prices until it just fills up and they don't have people standing around [LAUGH] outside in the rain waiting.
R:  Well, now ...
L:  [NOISE] You know, so it -- it works out pretty good I suppose.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So I guess everybody's happy.
R:  Here we have Avanti's.  I don't know if you were ever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Bloomington to try Avanti's for, um, [MN] pizza, gandola's[?] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anything in the way of Italian food.  It is just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- absolutely wonderful.
L:  [NOISE] I think I've heard my wife talking about that before.
R:  Well, it's, ah -- it's right across from the university.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And if -- when the kids are in school it's almost a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- battle to get in --
L:  [MN] Yeah, I --
R:  -- because it's always full.
L:  I know what you mean.  Have you ever [NOISE] eaten at Aldars?
R:  At where?
L:  Aldars.
R:  No, that's something we don't have.
L:  It's, ah -- well it's -- it's -- let's see, it's a restaurant in -- at -- it's either a Hilton or a Ritz, and it's somewhere -- oh, mercy, I've forgotten the spot, close to Wheeling or, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, what's that other place up there?  Just south of Wheeling, little bit to the West.  I -- I can't really think of the name.  It's -- it's a real, ah, super nice restaurant.  We ate there last Thanksgiving, ah, with some of my wife's family.  They live up in Wheeling and, ah, around that area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And we had, ah, Thanksgiving brunch up there.  And it was absolutely fantastic.  It was like seventy five dollars a person [NOISE] and you have to make reservations like seven or eight months in advance to get in.
R:  Well, it must be very good.
L:  Oh it was -- it was absolutely stunning. [NOISE]  We sat there and we -- we didn't actually eat, we grazed.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause you can [LAUGH] -- you can have anything from breakfast items to, ah, they would have like four or five whole turkeys and whole beef roasts and whole hams out there.  [NOISE] Um, you know, and you could tell them how you wanted it cooked.  They did omelets to order.  Ah, they -- they had like fifty different kinds of cheese, ah, all the champagne you wanted.  It was -- it was absolutely stunning. [NOISE]
R:  Kind of place where you go and make yourself sick.  You eat too much and -- [LAUGH] but it's all -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so good you can't stop. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you have to eat really, really slow --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, and -- and just let it spread out.
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] But that was -- that was excellent.  But for the most part I -- I'm much happier eating at home.  I'm --
R:  Well.
L:  [NOISE] I do all the cooking at our house, ah, except maybe once every couple of weeks I'll let my wife, um, you know, experiment with something.  She's -- you know, she's a good cook, but, um, I'm fifty years old and I've -- I have lived alone for a long time.  I've only been married to her for about six years now.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  [NOISE] And I had to -- I had to eat out of self defense. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?
L:  [NOISE] I had to -- I had to learn how to cook out of self defense I mean.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] So I -- I got to be a pretty good cook, so ...
R:  See, if I waited for --
L:  [NOISE] And I -- I just -- I just enjoy doing it.
R:  If I waited for my husband to cook we would starve to death.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The man forgets to eat.
L:  [NOISE] Oh I -- 
R:  I --
L:  [NOISE] -- I can't say I do that.
R:  I can't either.  It -- it just fascinates me.  I've been married to him for fifty years and I still don't understand how you can just simply forget to eat.
L:  [NOISE] Well, if I'm, you know, really tied up in a project or working on something, um --
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE] -- back in the workbench, you know, it can be -- you know, eleven o'clock at night and I'm sitting here thinking, "Hmm, I wonder what I can fix for lunch". [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.  This man, I mean, it's not -- it's just routine.  He just forgets to eat.  When I was still working I would go to work and I would come home, he'd say, "You know".  I worked on weekends --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- as well, you know, because I worked in a hospital.  And I would come home and he would say, "You know, I've just got an awful headache".
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  And I'd look at him and say, "What did you eat for lunch?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Oh, well gee, I guess I didn't eat any".
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  "Well, what did you have for breakfast?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Oh, I didn't eat breakfast".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I -- I just think, how does your body let you get away with it?
L:  [NOISE] My wife just doesn't understand that.  Like I said, I'm -- I'm fifty and she's thirty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And, um, you know, I -- I grew up when you get up in the morning, you know, breakfast is like a major meal.  You know, with her it was just, you know, pop in a toast or a bagel or something like that and get a cup of tea and, you know, that was it.  [NOISE] But, um, I -- I always get up like an hour before she does and get everything prepped now and, [NOISE] you know, sit there and knock out some omelets and make some turkey sausage or, um, ah, take some corned beef and put some gorgonzola cheese in it, a little mustard and roll 'em up and, you know, quick fry those.  And hash browns and a cup of tea and some juice and a glass of milk on the side.  A little cereal if she wants it.  Maybe put a bowl of nuts out there and we -- we got a spread that most people wouldn't have for dinner.
R:  Oh my, you must --
L:  [NOISE] You know, every -- every morning for breakfast.
R:  You must love to cook.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  Now, I --.
L:  [NOISE] You change it up though, you know, sometimes -- don't like, you know, fried eggs every morning or an omelette every morning, so, [NOISE] you know, maybe one day do French toast, you know, put a little cinnamon in there with it and [NOISE] maybe just a touch of nutmeg and a smattering of sugar.  Pour a little maple syrup over that when it's still hot or --
R:  Oh, you need to come and cook breakfast at my house.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Because I get up in the mornings, get a bowl of cereal --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  In nice weather stagger out on the porch and eat the cereal and read the paper until I wake up.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Ah --
L:  [NOISE] Well, it -- it -- it usually takes me about -- that's why I have to get up an hour early, 'cause it takes me like two cups of tea and a couple of cigarettes and [NOISE] -- and scratching the cat a little bit and, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] -- thinking about what I'm going to do.
R:  Think about what you're going to do.  Oh, no.  When I get up in the morning I'm hungry and I want my food now.
L:  [NOISE] Um, usually a couple of cups of tea will, you know, kind of hold me over for that.  But then because I u- -- I usually do eat such a -- a -- a large breakfast, you know, I -- I usually won't eat lunch or -- or eat something real snacky.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, if you get a -- get a, um -- we got, ah, a local company that, um, does some cream cheese and they started doing flavored cream cheeses.
R:  Oh, that'll --
L:  [NOISE] Ah, so we get like a, um -- a cream cheese dill.  Um, he -- he makes one with, ah, walnuts in it.  It's like finely crushed walnuts and it is excellent.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE] Toast up a quick bagel and put a little, you know, butter on that and smear some of that cream cheese on it and sit down with a cup of tea.  And, you know, when I get through with that I'm hungry.  [LAUGH] I'm ready for a serious breakfast.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Now, see, to me that -- the dill one sounds wonderful.
L:  Oh, it is.  It is excellent because he grows his own dill. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So he's -- he's got fresh dill.  He doesn't get the, you know, fifty pound bag of dried stuff.
R:  No, that's --
L:  [NOISE] You know, it's fairly expensive and it's only -- it's strictly a local market.  [NOISE] Like I said, we're a small town --
R:  Oh, yeah, but you know, you don't use much of it.
L:  [NOISE] No.  [LAUGH] I wou- -- I would if I could. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, now see I've tried some of the flavored ones that Kraft put out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the flavored cream cheese, and most of them I don't care for.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  The -- the -- the walnut and the dill are the -- are the -- the only two that I really --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  [NOISE] -- I really like.  I mean, the garlic is just -- to me is overpowering.
R:  Oh, no, that garlic, or that dill one.  I like dill. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Well I -- I love dill and garlic, but I -- I think he just puts too much in it.
R:  Well, that may -- very well may be because garlic is something that, you know, you either like it very strong or you like it just a touch.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, usually I like it very strong.  I -- I had to tone down my, ah, garlic bread, um -- we get like w- when we want garlic bread, instead of buying like the -- the packaged loaves in the store, you know, I get like a couple of binyets[?] and, you know, will -- will garlic 'em up at the house.  'Cause we -- we grow -- we have our own little herb garden in the back, you know.  So we have fresh garlic.  You know, and then rub it all over the, um, the -- the foil before you wrap it up to put it in.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] So that it -- it just cooks into the outside as well.  It's not like that powder that you just sprinkle on there.  It's a fresh oil and it gets into the bread that makes it kind of crusty on the outside.  Mm.
R:  Oh, how lovely.
L:  [NOISE] That is excellent.
R:  No wonder you --
L:  [NOISE] That's making me hungry. [LAUGH]
R:  -- no wonder you -- no wonder you like to eat at home.  You like -- you love to cook.
L:  [NOISE] The odd thing is, I'm, ah, about five eight and I weight a hundred and forty pounds.  
R:  Well, [inaudible].
L:  [NOISE] And I -- I have eaten like that every day of my life almost.
R:  Well, I tell you what my husband tells me
