L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi there. [NOISE]
R:  Hi, this is Brad.
L:  Hi, my name's Jeanette.
R:  Hi, how're --
L:  Are we --
R:  -- you doing today?
L:  Good, how are you?  Where are you calling from?
R:  I am in Mississippi.  How [NOISE] 'bout you?
L:  My goodness, you're a re- -- I'm up in Washington.
R:  Oh, we're on opposite si- [LAUGH] sides of the country almost.
L:  [NOISE] Got -- just picking up my kids from school here.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] So --
R:  So sounds like we have a good topic, food.
L:  [NOISE] Um, hello?
R:  Sounds like we have a good topic to talk about.
L:  [NOISE] I think so.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I think so.  [NOISE] So, um, what -- what -- what do you necessar- necessarily do?  I would prefer -- I would prefer cheaper, most of the time to eat at home. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Ah, it is cheaper and most of the times I do eat at home.  I -- I guess if, you know, as an ideal thing it'd be a restaurant.  Um --
L:  [PAUSE] Yeah, um, [NOISE] although when you go out where do you -- where do you usually go?  I know we wind up -- sometimes we'll -- we'll wind up fast fooding it, but sometimes we'll wind up, [MN] um, going to a restaurant as well.
R:  Well, I just graduated from school and I --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- probably mostly fast food just because I don't have very much money right now. [LAUGH]  Um, but o- occasionally my girlfriend and I will go out to, you know, a nicer place up -- I just like --
L:  Oh that's -- [PAUSE] you got to take it easy on the budget though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's -- [NOISE] that's pretty good.  Um, what I'm finding most often is -- is that I can wind up controlling the -- the, um, ah -- it's a -- it's a treat to go -- it's a treat to go out, but I -- but most of the time with -- you can -- you can wind up controlling the portions.  You can wind up spicing things the way you want to at home.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  I think I usually eat a lot more when I'm out [LAUGH] than I do at home.
L:  I-- that -- that too.  That too.  It makes, ah -- it makes it a -- a whole lot harder to restrain yourself. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, do you cook a lot?
L:  Um, yeah.  I mean, we -- well, basically we wind -- we wind up having to, to tor- -- just to save money.  We got a family of six.
R:  Re- -- oh wow.
L:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] anyway.  Yeah, and [MN] you can wind up putting in your own va- -- your own variety of stuff if you -- if you wind up -- if you wind up cooking.  We've got -- because we've got a -- we've got a large family, we've got a couple of freezers and we can wind up buying ahead and then you -- you -- you just pull some- -- pull something out.  It's a whole lot easier than spending maybe even -- even fifteen or twenty dollars out.
R:  Oh, right, yeah.  For six people I can imagine. [LAUGH]
L:   Yeah, now for one it's a little different.  I remember when I was batching it, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  You don't want to do the -- you want to do -- do spaghetti, or you don't have the -- the tuna fish or whatever, you know, just --
R:  Well, exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Pretty much, ah, you know, every once in a while I cook something, but it -- it's -- I don't want to have it for three days, you know, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I know.  That's the problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Big --
R:  So a lot of the times it's just, you know, sandwiches and frozen stuff and, ah, you know, things like that.  Something out of a box.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.  Oh, and it's -- it's -- it's -- it's easy and -- and it's -- it's convenient.  It may not be -- you can -- you want -- you can what -- well you can wind up healthy eating -- eating that way too.  You know, just add some fruit and -- fruit or veggies or whatever you like, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  Kind of -- or you could wind up even, you know, what -- what I probably would do if I were -- if I were back in those -- back in -- back in -- in those days.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I might wind up getting a -- getting a blender and making a smoothie or two or something like that that would -- you know, you can have --
R:  Sure.
L:  [NOISE] -- you know, you can have the same -- same kind of thing as you do when you're out.
R:  Yeah, you know, I -- I'll usually buy some fruit and have that for a snack, you know, bananas and apples and stuff like that.  And it's --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- it's pretty inexpensive.  It's good for you.
L:  [NOISE] For sure.  Sure.  And it fills you up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- you know, at least momentarily.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [inaudible] enough to tide you over to the next [LAUGH] -- the next temptation.  Um, which I -- which, you know, going -- going out to a restaurant, that's the other thing.  They -- they wind up -- the menus are really tempting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And, you know, so of course you're going to want that and you may want it -- it may be a bigger meal than -- than, as you say, you wind -- you wind up eating -- [LAUGH] eating a lot more.
R:  Well, I -- I usually have an appetizer and then, you know, have an entree.  And then I usually get a dessert 'cause I don't out -- out that much, so -- [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and I mean, how many times do you treat yourself, right?
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]  I deserve dessert. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, yeah, 'cause I usually don't have it when I'm at home.  I'm, ah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I live by myself, so --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, and you don't think about it.  I mean, it's just -- it -- it's -- it's grab something to survive and eat, and then -- and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- go on. 
R:  Well it -- if -- if I buy something and it's here, I'll eat it.  But if I don't --
L:  [NOISE] But --
R:  -- I don't think about it, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I don't miss it.  I don't miss what I don't know I don't have. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Kind of supply and demand.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] yeah, exactly. 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  What are you guys having --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and sometimes --
R:  -- for dinner tonight?
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Let's see, there's, ah [inaudible] spaghetti sauce and there's cuts of robin, and let's see, oh maybe -- oh, wait a minute, hey, there's some -- there's some canned peas in here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Type of thing.  Although probably the -- probably you can wind up putting -- putting together a better meal from that.
R:  Oh --
L:  So --
R:  -- now how old are the kids?  Are you --
L:  Um, all the way from fifteen to eight.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, like it's --
R:  -- yours are kind of picky, yeah? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, if there's -- if it's -- it's -- it's more -- it's more like see food, eat it.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Um, there's -- and we -- we wind up -- we wind up fixing -- fixing a meal and about fifteen minutes later, "I'm hungry".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Are you hungry or are you bored?" "I'm bored and I'm hungry".
R:  Right.
L:  So, and that's why we keep -- we keep the food around.  We keep the -- we've -- we've got fruit and bread and peanut butter and all kinds of -- and a lot of cheese and, you know --
R:  Do they like to eat fruit?  Like I know my kids won't eat fruit and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- vegetables and stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, I mean -- we're -- we're up here in Atlanta the land of apples.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that's -- that's one thing.  And oranges seem to go over pretty well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  What about --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- vegetables?  Do they like to eat that kind of stuff?  
L:  [NOISE] Likes it.
R:  Beans and carrots and all that?
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah, surprisingly.  I mean although we start- -- we started out with -- with basically when they were -- when they were old en- -- old enough to wind up -- to wind up being able to -- being able to say no or -- or wrinkle their -- wrinkle their -- their faces sometimes but one bite --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you eat -- unless there's nothing else in the house that's budgeted -- budgeted for the meal, you take one -- you take one bite of a new food and -- and chew it and swallow it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If you don't like it you don't have to have it again.  If you do like it, good.
R:  Well, I've heard that if you do that and you keep making 'em do it, you know, after ten or fifteen times, eventually they'll -- they'll start to like it.  I don't know if that's true, but --
L:  [NOISE] Well, we did -- we did it once and every so often we'd bring it -- we'd bring it back.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it wouldn't be like every night.  And we'd try not to have the same thing every night, um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- but it -- yeah, it kind of -- it kind of helped.  I mean, um, there are certain textures that people don't like and -- and I -- as I say unless there is nothing else in the house budgeted for the meal --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know how that goes --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] -- um, then he winds up getting a var- -- getting a variety of things.  And you kind of see, you know, you don't like -- okay, so you don't like french toast because it's mushy and you don't like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [NOISE] um, celery because it's crispy, and you don't like your -- your -- your [MN] -- you don't like peppers because they taste -- they feel weird.  I mean, that's fine.  And maybe a little later on, you know, two or three years down the road we'll try it again and it's a hit.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I mean there's been lots of things as I've gotten older that I would never eat when I was a kid --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just hated 'em.  But now I like 'em, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] That's good.  That's a -- that's -- I think -- well, it's -- it's en- -- it's encouraging that you're [inaudible] is, you know, from -- from a parental point of view, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] -- um, it's -- it's encouraging to probably -- it's -- it's, you know -- it's -- it's kind of a -- kind of a surprise for you too, but, um, you know, it's -- it's interesting to observe how [inaudible] change.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I don't know if you've ever had -- have you ever wound up, um, eating something familiar and then having a reaction to it?
R:  No, no, I haven't.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  I haven't had that happen.
L:  [NOISE] Huh.  Okay.  Well, I know that sometimes it's -- it's -- it's real s- -- it's real strange.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Um, because my dad had -- my dad's been eating -- been eating seafood for, you know, decades.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And lo and behold, he went out to a restaurant once and, I don't know if it was the place or the way it was prepared or something like that, he had a horrible reaction.
R:  Mm, no.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it didn't stop him from eating it.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] But it was just that one time.  I don't know if it was just spiced or if it was something else that was involved.
R:  It may have been.  I have a friend, his wife is pregnant.  And they went to a Mexican restaurant and she had an allergic reaction and she ended up having to go to the hospital and --
L:  [NOISE] Ooh.
R:  -- actually it was a -- a certain type of spice that they had used in the food.  Um, that I guess --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- that she had never had before, and, ah, but that -- that was kind of weird.
L:  Oh, for heavens sake.  You know what?  It's -- it's -- it's amazing how -- how something can be -- can be -- we can be s- -- our systems are so -- are so finely tuned to -- to some things. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that is really pretty amazing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So -- well I'm glad -- I'm glad she was -- she was okay.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she was fine.  She just, ah, staying away from, ah, Mexican food for a while. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah I would imagine.  You know, you get that -- get that reaction [LAUGH] and "I don't want to touch this".
R:  Right, you go to a restaurant, you never know really exactly, you know, everything they're putting in there, so --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, it's like -- it's like one of -- I -- I don't know if you -- if you find -- we find with -- with different kinds -- different kinds of take out, different kinds of -- kinds of pizza --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- even if we eat in or ta- -- or take it out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, the sausages are different.
R:  Right.
L:  And even within -- within the same -- within -- in the same -- the same chain there's everything can -- can vary a little bit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, you know, as non-picky as -- as -- as these -- as these folks are, every so often we -- we come across something it's, "When are we going to go there again?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Might go -- might go to another -- another branch but not there.
