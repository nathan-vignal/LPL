R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Sharon.  I'm from Chicago.
L:  Hi, Sharon.  My name's Samantha.  I'm from New York City.
R:  Okay.  So we're supposed to talk about friends?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Um, so you want to tell me about your friends or how you make friends?
L:  It's -- it's actually kinda interesting.  All my friends are friends through me.  I'm like friends with, like, five different groups of people that have all become this one major group through me.
R:  Oh, that's neat. 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's kinda cool.
R:  Uh, how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty seven.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  How old are you?
R:  Thirty six.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  I have a very small group of friends.  My husband and I are pretty laid back.
L:  I think it gets that -- like now it's starting, you know, like I have my friends that I've had for a couple of years and I haven't really made new ones.
R:  Yeah, I have --
L:  Like except as, like, couples we have a little bit. 
R:  Yeah.  My friends through high school are still there.  I +mean it -- we could not be around each other for years but once we see each other again it's like we're just in high school.
L:  Mhm.  It's -- it's hard 'cause we're actually talking of this.  I'm getting married this summer and my fiance's from L.A. and I'm from New York and my mom's like, we -- you know, we're thinking about moving to New York and I'm like terrified because I don't have any friends there.  
R:  How did -- how did you end up meeting a guy in L.A.?
L:  Well, he lives in New York now.  But he's from --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- L.A.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  
L:  But eventually he'd like to go back and I have such good friends here, you know.  Like I really -- I don't have much family.  I'm very close to my friends.  I really don't want to leave them.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that would be difficult.  Yeah, I'm -- you know, with my group of friends it was hard with me because I wa- -- we were the first ones, my husband and I, to get married and have kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was twenty four.  
L:  Wow.
R:  And so my friends were out still at the bars.  [LAUGH]  You know and I've got an infant so they stopped calling me.  You know, even though they're still my friends they figured, you know, Sharon can't go out.  She's got the kid.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now I'm thirty six, my kids can be babysitting their kids that they're just having now.  So I'm sort of like in this limbo world here.  Even though our friends --
L:  [MN]  I mean, I'm the first out of my friends getting married but most of them are single and I'm not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But my fiance, a lot of his friends are couples and [SIGH] we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hang out with them and we're getting to be friends with them but its like different.  Like if I move out to L.A.  I have friends that I've been friends with for years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For years.  And all kinds of friends.  Like that I can really -- I really, like, have my core group of friends that I can count on for everything.
R:  Yeah, but they'd be a world ap- away from you.  
L:  Exactly.  And the thing about New York City is like everyone comes back here.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like -- so it's not like my friends are far away.  Everyone is back here in New York City. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where like he's from L.A.  Like people move all over the place.  Some are in New York.  Some are here.  You know, some are there.  And all my friends are here.  They all came back here.
R:  Yeah.  Is that -- that's gonna be like a big decision for you guys.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]  It's hard.  
R:  Is that like a relationship breaker?
L:  Oh, no.  We're getting married.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  And like if it came to that point he said he would stay here.  
R:  Wow.
L:  But I -- I mean, I'm interested in trying California.
R:  I've always ha- I have been through is -- for moving, yeah, because the possibilities.
L:  His family's there.  It'd be nice when we have kids to have them help out, so you know.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, uh, do you work?
L:  Yeah.  I'm a teacher.  
R:  Oh.  You'll meet lots of parents.  Who knows you'll hit it off with somebody.
L:  I'm hoping.  I'm ho- -- I -- I plan like I -- I won't need to work when we move out there but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I mean I can't --
R:  I've never worked.
L:  You've never --
R:  I mean, before -- before we got married I worked my butt off but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, since we got married and had kids right away I've always stayed home.  
L:  [NOISE]
L:  But I was never the one that had the mommy group and the play group, and all of that.  
L:  Mhm.  No?
R:  I never -- I never did that thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That whole yuppie -- I put it like in the --
L:  See, I -- I --
R:  -- yuppie [inaudible].
L:  -- guess I would -- I -- like I look forward to [LAUGH] that because I'm like, "Oh, my God if I'm in California I need to join all that stuff".  
R:  You know, part of me wishes that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I did that but it's just not me.  I'm more of like a loner type.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But when I get involved with a group of people, like if I have friends they're like serious.  You know, I hang with them, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're like part of me.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  When they're that close.  And the cool thing between me and my husband is that we both went to the same high school and even though he's two years apart from me we -- we're in a big high school.  There was like four thousand people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um --
L:  That's how much mine was.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So he was into sports and [MN] the year like -- if I was a sophomore he was a senior, the junior year people, we ended up both hanging out with at different times so he knew everybody we knew -- that I knew.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  
R:  Yeah.  So I ended up marrying my best friend.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which was cool.  But ...
L:  That is -- I'm marrying my best friend.
R:  That -- I think --
L:  I am.
R:  -- that's the best way.  You know --
L:  It is.
R:  -- you become friends first and then all of a sudden it's a helluva lot more and ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, we were always more 'cause I think we  were just older.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, um, he's my best friend.
R:  That's cool.  That's cool.
L:  And -- but that's my whole thing with friends.  I have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I'm having this whole wedding.  I wanted to run away and elope but my friends were like, "No, you can't do that.  We want to see you get married".  So now we're having the whole traditional wedding thing with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a hundred people at a catering hall and ...
R:  You know what my mom [LAUGH] told me about that was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, the wedding ce- -- you know, the reception isn't for you.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]
R:  Like what?  No, it's for your friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and your family.  It's for us.  I'm like, okay.  You know.  But it'll be lots of fun.  You'll have a great time.
L:  I'm excited.  We're having two in the same week.  Flying out to L.A. and having another one a week later.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  With all --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- his family and friends.  
R:  My friend -- my -- actually my friend did that.  She's from here and her husband is from Connecticut and they couldn't all fly in so they had the wedding and reception here and then they went out to Connecticut and had another reception there.
L:  Yeah.  That's what we're doing and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's crazy.  And then we have to -- my fiance is a resident, um, so he really only gets off a week so we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have like a week to have our honeymoon, to get married --
R:  Yeah, you won't be --
L:  -- have another reception.
R:  -- seeing much of him, will you?
L:  What?
R:  You won't --
L:  No, well, it's -- I mean, this is already his third year so it's not like ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  He's very good about it.  Um, I see him every night almost.  
R:  Well, you're [MN] --
L:  Only one night a week without him.
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I think we're --
L:  So ...
R:  -- kinda getting off the [LAUGH] subject.  
L:  But, um --
R:  But I guess when you marry your best friend s- stuff like that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- distance doesn't -- you know, my husband travels all the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like this week he's gone for four days.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And --
L:  I think that's even harder than what -- what I'm doing.  
R:  I don't -- you know, I don't mind if he's gone like one night --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- two nights.  But four days is hard.  But, uh, you know, he -- I can just talk to him on the phone.  It's -- and I feel so much better, you know what I mean?  Do you ever -- does he ever have time to call you when he's working?
L:  Yeah.  He calls me but it's like I can't sleep when he's not here so it's [LAUGH] bad.
R:  My first night --
L:  And he can't sleep either.
R:  -- when my husband's gone I sleep with my baseball bat.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm not scared but I just can't sleep.
R:  No, I have it --
L:  It's ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's the weird thing.  I, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, you know, being that also too he, you know, he's my best friend, I don't -- we don't have to go do anything. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I could hang around the house.  We don't even have to sit and have a conversation.  With him here just, you know, having my friend here makes me comfortable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, you don't have to do anything at all.  Which is cool.
L:  It is.  But li- I-- but I -- I'm trying not to get into that rut so we try and -- we been trying to be a lot more social and go out with a lot more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- couples and make, like, couple friends.  Because all my friends are single so we want --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to have more -- like a lot of his friends are married.  Or the people he works with.  So we're trying to get more couples together and have more ...
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Which is nice.
R:  It's hard --
L:  Which I really like that.  It's hard to do though.
R:  I would love to do that.  It -- but it's so hard once you have kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, all my friends -- now my friends are having little kids and they're working full time jobs.  They get hope at six o'clock.
L:  Well, I know when I was little my mom used to try and make friends with my friends' parents --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I was a little kid so that she can hang out with them and I could hang out with my friends.  And it all worked -- kinda worked nicely.
R:  Yeah.  I wish I had more, like -- 'cause we moved where we are about three years ago.  And even though my daughter's in school and I'm making, you know, friends with her parents, and stuff like that, or with friends' parents and stuff like that, I just don't feel as close.
L:  Mhm.  Well, it takes time.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  But if you invite them over and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] with the girls and things like that.  
R:  Yeah.  I know there's always that good intention, kind of [LAUGH] stuff.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  But, um, so you, uh, had a big high school, you said?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Huge.  But it's funny.  I'm not friends with anyone from high school really.
R:  Really?
L:  All my friends are from like my youth group which was like a [inaudible] youth group.  A Jewish youth group from my temple.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And college.  And grad school and camp.  
R:  And what camp?
L:  Are my really close friends.  Different camps over the years.  But I went to this -- I worked at this one [inaudible] camp that my best fr- -- like, one of my closest friends, Jessica, she's from North Carolina.  She moved up to New York.  She's a film maker and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my friend, Cindy, who I met that summer too, and she is -- she got married.  I was in her wedding.  I was her maid of honor.
R:  Oh, wo-
