L:  Hello.
R:  [MN]  Hello.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.  
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  My name's Penny.
L:  I'm Lesley.
R:  I am up in Michigan.  Are you anywhere close?
L:  No, I'm in, um, L.A. area.  
R:  Oh, geez.  I bet you guys got nice weather.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  We got cold weather.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Cold and rainy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  We're not --
L:  Um --
R:  -- so lucky.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  So are we supposed to -- okay.
R:  That's okay.  I have three kids at --
L:  Um --
R:  -- home so I will probably [LAUGH] have to do the same.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Huh?
R:  I have three kids at home so I probably have to be on and off here myself.  
L:  Um, I'm actually eating right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, okay, um, food.  I prefer to eat out.  
R:  Do ya?
L:  Um --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just easier and I'd rather talk with people.  I love going out to eat with people.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The best.  Or at least somebody else's cooking and not me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you -- uh, do you have a family?
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  Do ya?
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, my mom doesn't cook anymore.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I have to go to my aunt's house if I want home cooking or something?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So it is easier for you to just go out?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm -- I been a college student forever so that's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- probably why.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean --
R:  What's your fav- what is your favorite place to eat out there?
L:  Um, oh, my gosh.  I just get less picky and picky over the years.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, well, I don't know.  I have a lot of favorites.  I just like -- I just like to vary it all the time.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Um, I don't know.  I don't have -- I never have favorites.  I just love lots of things.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  You guys probably have a lot more choices out there than we do here. 
L:  What do you guys have there?
R:  Well, I'm in a small town kind of.  It's about an hour and fifteen minutes outside of Detroit.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's hard for us to get anything, I mean, we are just getting an authentic Mexican restaurant.  One.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Yeah, it's horrible.  [LAUGH]  'Cause I --
L:  I can't live without an authentic taco shop.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  'Cause, you know, the only thing we've really had is a Taco Bell.  
L:  Oh, no that's --
R:  For --
L:  -- not real.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's -- it's bad.  And, uh, the same --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for anything like Chinese or anything like that.  It's all just -- it's your basic --
L:  We have everything here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  I imagine --
L:  We have Thai.  Um, Filipino.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  And we'd never have anything like that.  
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  So ...  Very, very -- and then if it does come in, something like that, it doesn't stay because this city just isn't enough to support it.  Being --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- something like that.  
L:  And then you guys wouldn't be used to the food probably.  
R:  Right.  Right.  So I prefer to eat out too just because I have three kids and it's [LAUGH] a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- easier but it's not always as practical.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, it's nice -- I mean, I watch the Food Channel all the time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Yeah, but I never make the stuff.  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I just -- it's just nice to have someone talk to you while they're making [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'm actually --
L:  So are you close --
R:  -- watching it right now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are you close then to, as far as going to a restaurant or just going to get something to eat like that?
L:  Pardon?
R:  Are you close to something like that if you wanted to go to a restaurant, to just walk or just ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Yeah?
L:  I mean, I live right by a shopping mall.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's pretty close to everything.  Yeah.  Um ...
R:  So it's just --
L: But didn't -- [inaudible] didn't ask us what's our favorite food?
R:  I don't -- yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't even --
L:  I don't -- what is your favorite food?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't even know.  Um, God.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't even know if I'd have a favorite food.  
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, 'cause I --
L:  You gotta have some kind of thing you love to eat.
R:  I like -- well, I like Chinese.  And I like Mexican  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, pizza, of course.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My favorite kind?  I don't know.  Something that I just absolutely have to have.  
L:  I lo- I love avocado.  Like I'm obsessed with it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  How do you eat it or how do you make it?  Do you just make it and eat it or ...?
L:  Oh, man, I could just eat it like it is or I can make guacamole or put it in my sandwich or ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or like, well, there's like a Filipino way to make it where it's like you put sugar in it and milk in it.  
R:  Huh.
L:  And -- yeah.  So I mean -- and then there's like avocado shakes.  And they sell it at like little, I don't know, you never heard of boba I guess?
R:  No. 
L:  Boba.  They're like these little Asian teashops where they have all these tapioca balls in their drink and there's like a million kinds of, like, tea or fruit, tropical fruit flavored drinks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and stuff.  And they put all these balls in, these tapioca balls, like giant tapioca balls.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yeah, in the drinks.  
R:  Oh, that sounds cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You guys are so much more culturally diverse than we are.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, especially when it comes to food and stuff like that.  
L:  Yeah, I guess 'cause we're all here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yep.  Yep.  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- New York, you know.  You'd be able to have all that different stuff.  I mean, even Detroit.  I don't even think Detroit is that diversified when it comes to that stuff.  
L:  Mm.  I don't know.  I --
R:  So ...
L:  I don't know that area at all.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- been up this way?
L:  No.  I've --
R:  No?
L:  -- only been across -- we've only driven across the bottom of the country.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And so I've been through the south.
R:  Right.
L:  And I've been to Hawaii and, uh ...
R:  Well, there's not much up here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You're not missing anything.  Unless you'd like to see the snow.  I mean, that's about the [LAUGH] only thing to really come up this way for.  
L:  Yeah, I can't deal with snow.  I feel like it's [inaudible]?
R:  Really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I just -- it's just too darn cold for me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Gosh, it is.
L:  I can't deal with it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I hate it.
L:  I -- [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I go to the -- this -- I go to San Francisco and that wind blows and I just, like, oh, I'm shaking.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I can't deal with it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Then you'd never make it here in the wintertime.  
L:  No.
R:  'Cause it's -- it's bad.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Real bad.  Even our summer, I mean, I was just saying today it is June already and we're barely in the upper sixties and --
L:  Really?
R:  -- it rains.  Yep.
L:  It's been so warm lately.  
R:  Wow.  You guys must be getting it all 'cause we ain't.  It's been --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- raining and cold.
L:  But, I mean, normally it can be way hotter than this and it hasn't been as hot as we could be.  
R:  Mm.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Send it up this way 'cause we need it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm sick of this --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- weather.
L:  I mean, it's been cloudy the past few days but it's still warm.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  I don't know.
R:  I don't know if I could live in California.
L:  I don't [LAUGH] know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, well, it's pretty smoggy in my area.  
R:  Is it?
L:  I can't breathe literally.  
R:  Huh.
L:  I can't -- yeah, I take asthma pills everyday.  
R:  Wow.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And that's in the L.A. area?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Huh.  I've been to Burbank but it's been a few years.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I never had asthma problems 'til I moved.  I'm actually from San Diego.
R:  Oh, are ya?
L:  Yeah.  This is a long ten minutes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Is this your first one?  Or have you been doing these for a while?
L:  These are my -- this is my fourth one.  
R:  Your fourth one?
L:  Yeah.  How 'bout you?
R:  This is my third one, I believe it is.  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I'm pretty sure --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's my fourth one.  
R:  Yeah.  A couple of 'em I've missed and one I waited, like, ten minutes for them to find another caller and they couldn't find anybody so I [several inaudible words].
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I o- I missed one because, um, my phone died.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I was like, "Damn.  Ten bucks".  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Down the drain.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  I kind of take 'em whenever I can.  The one that they couldn't find anybody for, it was a Sunday.  It was kind of, you know, late afternoon and I thought, well, maybe that's got something to do with it.  
L:  Well, actually --
R:  But --
L:  -- I got one on a Sunday afternoon.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  No problems.  
R:  And my topic that day was war in the Middle East or, I don't --
L:  Oh, maybe nobody wanted to talk about [LAUGH] that.
R:  That's -- that's what I was thinking.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, maybe, nobody wanted that one so ...   [LAUGH] 
L:  War in the Middle ...  Probably people are just, uh, really, really, really sick of that one.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I've had families and health and fitness.  And there's another one.  I can't even remember that I missed.  But I don't remember what the topic was.  Something.  Food's pretty ea- --
L:  Yeah.
