L:  Hi, my name is Eme[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Katie.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  Do you want to go first?
L:  Ah, sure.  Ah, let's see, what do I prefer eating, um, better?  I think I like eating at home better.
R:  And why is that?
L:  But once in a while eating out.  Um, at home, you know, you get to be more relaxed and -- and it's not as formal.  You get to cook what you want.  You get more variety.  And sometimes the food that restaurants cook you, you know, they put excessive oil on there that you don't really need for the food to taste good.
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  [MN] Do ever order take out food?
L:  What was that?
R:  Do you ever order delivery?
L:  Delivery?
R:  Yeah.
L:  N- no, not really.
R:  Not really?
L:  No.  [inaudible].
R:  So, do you -- it's either cooking at home or eating out?  How often do you eat out at restaurants?
L:  [MN] Um, I'd say about once every couple of weeks.
R:  Every couple of weeks?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Do you cook a lot?
L:  Occasionally. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you -- what do you -- do you eat three meals a day?  Even though you -- I mean, 'cause -- 
L:  Not really.
R:  -- cooking's hard. [LAUGH]
L:  Cooking's hard?
R:  Yeah, it takes effort. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, well, you know, you get used to it.  Get's into your -- um, I cook -- I mean, like there's a lot of dishes you can cook that are pretty easy to make, like pasta and stuff. 
R:  Do you live by yourself?
L:  No, I live with my family.
R:  So, that makes it also easier, 'cause then you're cooking for a lot of people and other people cook for you.
L:  Um, yeah.  What about you?  You don't -- you live on your own?
R:  Well, I have a room mate, but, um, I have to go out to eat at restaurants for my job a lot, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah, it's kind of taking on a, ah, sort of a even more uncomfortable association.  And I don't really fi- -- I just -- I actually like to eat at home too more. [LAUGH]  Just because you can c- -- you really can relax and you can get other things done and you can, you know, you're paced at however you want to.  You know?
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  But I usu- -- but I don't cook.  I always [MN] -- I always order out. [MN]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But --
L:  What kind of food?
R:  I'm not a big food person either.
L:  Really?  What do you usually eat?
R:  I just -- you know, I eat like a sandwich, you know.  I don't eat that much.  It's kind of -- I've never been a big eater.  Like, you know how some people eat all the time?
L:  Yeah, like me. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't.  It's just -- it's like, I don't know.  Like every room mate I've ever had, it's been that -- they've always been kind of perplexed by my eating habits.  And it's not like I've an eating disorder, [MN] I just -- it's just -- you know, it's like I've other things that I'm always focussed on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.  You won't ever, you know, gain that much weight. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Right.  But you never know, the metabolism slows down. [LAUGH]  But, yeah.  No, I definitely like -- or just having -- I like having like salads in the fridge and just eating those.  But I don't know.  I di- -- I recently haven't been like going out to restaurants at all.  And I have a bunch of gift certificates and I haven't used them because I'm just tired of it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, in the summer it's nice though.  Because you get to go out and you can go sit on the patio and have some drinks.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And that can be more relaxing.  Sit on a sidewalk [LIPSMACK] and --
L:  So if you do go out to eat, where -- where -- what would you -- where would you go?
R:  Well, what area do you live in?
L:  Um, San Jose.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Ah, the [inaudible] area.
R:  In Santa Fe?  'Cause I'm in Boston.  So, it's --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah.  So -- and I'm in the western burbs of Boston.  So there's a lot of nice restaurants out here.  And I entertain for work, so I usually go to, you know, kind of fancyish restaurants.
L:  Right.
R:  But I like junk food mostly. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you?
R:  I like crappy food, yeah.  Yeah, like junk. [LAUGH]
L:  What do you mean by --
R:  Which is horrible.  If I go out to eat --
L:  -- junk food?
R:  -- I always bu- -- get the worst stuff.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  At least I think I do. [LAUGH]  I don't know if that's actually true.
L:  Well, if you don't go that often it's all right.
R:  You might need to get a more objective source than me, but yeah.  So the verdict, it's eat at home. [LAUGH]
L:  Me? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  We're two misanthropes that want to just eat in our privacy. [LAUGH]
L:  What was that?
R:  We're two solitary figures that just want to eat at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that [inaudible] so I think that resolves it, right?
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  That answers our question.  Is there anything else that you can think of?
L:  Um, [PAUSE] not really.  I'm -- you don't -- you don't cook that often, right?
R:  I really pretty much never cook.  I don't think I've ever turned my oven on.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  And my room mate cooks --
L:  Are you a college student?
R:  -- every day. [LAUGH]
L:  Are you a college student?
R:  No, I'm a -- I actually work.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  So I just -- it's just, um, I don't know, it just doesn't -- my room mate u- -- cooks every day.  She cooks like a full dinner with the, you know, like stuff like a -- some of it you'd really have with a family. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I don't.
L:  But she eats by herself?
R:  Yeah, she eats either by herself or with her boyfriend.
L:  Oh.
R:  But it's just I can't -- like, you know how some people when they live with a room mate they -- [LIPSMACK] they cook for both of them?  I just wouldn't eat enough to justify it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?  It's not -- like, it's not that I, you know, I'm trying to, like, section myself off, it's just that's how it is.  And I have a busy schedule so I'm not around that much anyway.
L:  Well, you'd make, ah -- you'd make a good room mate. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]  I'm like -- no, yeah.  No, the -- yeah, I don't cook, I don't make that many dishes. [LAUGH]  It definitely does eliminate some of the mess, huh? [MN]
L:  [PAUSE] Wh- what kind of food do you like to eat?  Like, ah, steaks or like, ah, b- burgers, or --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- pasta, Chinese food?
R:  Things that -- ah, just anything that's not that greasy.  Something that's light that doesn't make me feel sick.  'Cause that's why I don't, you know -- like just tuna salads.  I like pr- -- to try to eat as much protein as possible, you know.
L:  A lot of protein?
R:  I eat a lot of protein bars actually when I get hungry 'cause it --
L:  Really?
R:  -- just takes care of it and you don't have to deal with it.
L:  Do you -- are you, ah -- do you like to exercise?
R:  Yeah, I exercise a lot.
L:  Well, have you ever tried the Atkins diet?
R:  Yeah, I have. [LAUGH]
L:  What was that?
R:  I have tried it.
L:  Has it worked?
R:  Ah, [MN] I don't know.  I think it's really for -- you could probably tell if it works better if you're, um, [MN] obese.  But I -- I will say I did get really lean when I did it for a couple of weeks.  But it's hard to maintain --
L:  Why, 'cause you have cravings?
R:  -- and you have to make really special dietary modifications, which are really aggravating.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm trying it right now.
R:  My mom's on it right now. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really?
R:  And that -- she's losing weight like crazy.
L:  How mu- -- how much weight has she lost?
R:  Ah, she's lost like fifteen pounds.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've -- I've been on this Atkins diet for, ah, about two, three weeks and I've gained like five pounds.
R:  Oh, you're kidding?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you doing it right though?
L:  Ah, I'm not sure.  Well, they say like for the first two weeks you're on a really strict diet right, where you can't eat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess I kind of cheat a little bit. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause -- well, you know what though?  [NOISE] It really depends on how -- what a little bit of cheating is.  'Cause it shouldn't be that -- it's not that bad if you -- if you're under twenty grams of carbs, which is actually really hard to do.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  It's so hard. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, what can you find that has --
R:  It's kind of crazy the things that you crave when you're on it too.  It's not even the obvious things.  It's like something with, like, just a little more carbs than you're [LAUGH] supposed to have.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah.  No, I'm not -- I'm not -- I tried it like a -- a couple of times.  But I don't know.  I've tried eating clean, like how the weight lifters eat, where there's no salt and it's just all protein and lean meat.  [MN] And that's actually really effective --
L:  Really?
R:  -- but it's impossible.  It's so mis- -- it's such a miserable existence.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because it's like --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- no salt, no citric acid.  Nothing, like, no flavor.  Just chicken breasts and like a c- -- a little bit of steamed broccoli.  It's pretty terrifying, to be honest with you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it works really well.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  How much weight do you have to lose?
L:  Um, well, I'm not really -- I -- I'm one eighty right now and I had a target of one sixty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, I -- I notice that, like, if I don't -- I mean I don't really -- it doesn't really matter what I eat as long as I just exercise three or four times a week, and I haven't done that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So I tried this Atkins thing where, you know -- and I stopped exercising and I gained five pounds. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know what though?  That's k- -- that has a lot to do with the original question of whether you like to eat out or not.  Because when you eat at a restaurant it is impossible to control what you're eating.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  There's no
