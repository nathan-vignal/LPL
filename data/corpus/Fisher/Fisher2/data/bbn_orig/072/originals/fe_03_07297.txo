L:  Hi, my name is Willa.
R:  Hi, my name is Mariah.
L:  Mya?
R:  Mariah.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  
L:  Good.  Uh, this should be an easy topic.  
R:  That's what I thought.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.
R:  I'm standing here making dinner even, so ...
L:  Okay.  You're -- you're, uh, you eat late?
R:  Yes, we do.
L:  Okay.  Oh, we're finished already.  We're retired people so we've --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, we eat a little bit earlier.  
R:  As my husband typically works, uh, ten to six --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so he worked over tonight so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- by the time he gets --
L:  Well --
R:  -- then --
L:  That'll do it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yep.  
L:  Yeah.  Um, now they want us to talk about whether we prefer restaurant eating or cooking at home.  Uh, what's your preference?
R:  I typically prefer to cook at home.  I'm a stay at home mom so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't have much of a job if I don't get to cook at [LAUGH] home.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Uh, how many children do you have?
R:  We just have one.  
L:  Oh.  Very nice.  Uh, uh, well, we're retired.  So we have more free time and we can eat out more.  Um, I enjoy cooking at home but, uh, we don't do heavy cooking anymore.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, we do, um, simple things at this stage.  Uh, so we prefer eating out when we want a really opulent meal.  Uh, my kitchen's very small and -- and, uh, very difficult to, uh, to create a- any masterpieces in it anymore.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, are you a gourmet cook or ...?
R:  Well, I -- I'd like to be.  I don't think -- I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't think I quite qualify as that but ...
L:  Okay.  
R:  Not too much I can't make as long as I have a recipe, so ...
L:  Yeah.  I always said if you can read you can cook.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh --
R:  Not too hard.
L:  Yeah.  It isn't difficult.  [LAUGH]  That's all.  And if you have a willing participant to eat it then you're, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- okay.  [LAUGH]  Uh, what type of cooking do you prefer?  Anything special?
R:  Um, I like to make lasagna.  I'm -- I'm big on Italian foods.  Anything I can put garlic in I think is --
L:  Oh, you and --
R:  -- good for my family.
L:  -- I would get along great.  
R:  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  I love garlic.  
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  On everything.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, they've recently come out with all these studies where they say it reduces all kinds of types of cancer.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm like, well, you know, no cancer --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- would come near our house.  [LAUGH] 
L:  All right.  Also I think they said it reduces, uh, cholesterol or raises the HDL or something which --
R:  That's --
L:  -- uh, we're worrying about now so, uh, I cook with garlic all the time.  Uh, I find it's, uh, it -- it peps up, uh, just about everything except maybe ice cream.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, it -- it doesn't go well in desserts.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Unfortunately.  I'd find a way to put it in if it did.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, yeah.  I think so.  Yeah.  Uh, I used to love to, uh, bake.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I did a lot of baking so ...
R:  I like to make a lot of things from scratch.
L:  From scratch.
R:  I grew up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- helping my grandma can --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and make, you know, home made pies for my pumpkin and so I just --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I always fascinate the neighbors because, you know, they come over to my house and I'd just made salsa or I'd just made pumpkin pies from the pumpkins that they seen on our porch and ...
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  They're like, "What are you doing?"  
L:  Uh-huh.  I [MN] --
R:  "How did you do that?"
L:  Yeah.  I've done that too.  I've done the -- not the salsa, that wasn't popular when I was, uh, doing any real cooking.  But I've done the, uh, the pumpkin pies and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from the pumpkin.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you take the seeds and you -- did you ever roast them in the salt.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  Oh, I love that.
R:  You can't waste the seeds.  That's the best part.
L:  Oh, no.  They're delicious.  Yeah.  So, uh, so you do a lot of scratch cooking?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah.  Casseroles are always good too.
R:  Yep.  That's -- we're having a -- we're having alfredo tonight with --
L:  Oh, great.
R:  We had --
L:  Yum.  [LAUGH] 
R:  We had a casserole last night.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...  
L:  And, uh, yeah.  And then, of course, leftovers to put in the freezer.
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  So ...  I think some of our best meals at home used to be when we cleaned the freezer and refrigerator of all the leftovers.
R:  Well, that's what I've been working on lately.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I know summer the bills go down and I'm like I've gotta fill the freezer back up so we have to empty it first.
L:  Right.  Of course.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And everybody's like we're having year old pot roast [LAUGH] tonight.  Thanks, mom.  
L:  Okay.  
R:  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Don't tell them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I've -- I've quit telling 'em now, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  What they don't know what hurt them so ...
L:  I found when I told my husband what was in something he never wanted to eat it.  
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  And the kids too when we, uh --
R:  I think I've out ruined meatloaf that way one time.
L:  Oh, God.  [LAUGH] 
R:  He saw me [LAUGH] making it and ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I didn't think I'd get him to eat it again.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, great.  [LAUGH]  Well, the first time I handled chicken when I was a newlywed and I -- and I --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- brought a raw chicken.  I couldn't eat that night because it was, you know, it was [LAUGH] awful.  [MN] I got over that quick.  
R:  Well, see growing up on a farm I got to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- experience chickens from a completely different angle.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know you were raising 'em and then you chopped their heads off --
L:  Oh, God.
R:  -- and you held 'em -- 
L:  Oh.  I'm --
R:  -- down and ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm a big city girl so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Let me tell you.  If you can handle that, raw chicken --
L:  Yeah.  Oh, God.
R:  -- no problem.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, chicken came in the butcher shop.  You know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  In pieces.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  As far as I was concerned.  
R:  That's -- 
L:  Without feathers.
R:  That's how most people see it so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, now -- now we enjoy going out to restaurants a couple times a week and, uh, we've been experimenting with different kinds of foods, you know, like Thai food and, uh, Japanese.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's --
R:  Well, how's Thai?  I havn't ever had Thai.
L:  Thai is delicious.  I prefer it to Japanese.  Thai food is, um, is -- is spicy but not, uh, not outrageously so.
R:  Hm.  Well, that's --
L:  [MN]
R:  I roll sushi all the time here at home --
L:  Oh, no.  I can't --
R:  -- but ...
L:  I can't eat raw fish.  I can't get --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- myself to try it.  And I just got back from Japan where it was given --
R:  Well, I was gonna say maybe -- maybe try, um, like a vegetable sushi instead.
L:  That might do it.
R:  'Cause they have those California rolls and they'll have like cucumbers and carrots in them.
L:  Oh, that --
R:  So --
L:  -- I can handle.  [LAUGH] 
R:  See, that's not so bad.
L:  No.  No.
R:  And some of them have that imitation crab in them.
L:  Which is cooked?
R:  Which is already cooked.
L:  Yeah.  That I could do but, uh, not raw fish.  
R:  That's -- that's what I usually do for people who are more nervous about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what I'm about to feed them.  I -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- whip out the vegetables or the crab and they're like --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- oh, this isn't bad.  We can -- we can eat this.  I'm like --
L:  Can eat this.  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  My children like, uh, like, uh, sushi.  They enjoy trying new things.  And my daughter is a gourmet cook.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  She loves to experiment.  
R:  That's --
L:  So, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- she makes everything [inaudible] so, uh, we -- 
R:  Well, I think --
L:  -- we try things there.  
R:  I think it's good to try new recipes.  It --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- keeps you from --
L:  Oh, always. 
R:  -- getting tired of cooking.  
L:  You are?
R:  Uh, no, I said it keeps you from getting tired --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- of cooking.  If you -- if you just stick to those same recipes you start feeling like [MN].
L:  Well, oh -- oh that again.
R:  We just had this to eat.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I kind of miss some of the things I used to make.  You know, when I had a big family.  Uh, th- uh, things that don't go good if you just have two people eating them.  You need a, you know, four or five.
R:  Well, invite the neighbors over.
L:  No way.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No those days are gone forever.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The dinner parties are over.  [LAUGH]  No, we -- we, uh, entertain by, uh, having somebody come over for drinks and hors d'oeuvres and then we all go out to dinner.
R:  Oh.
L:  That's the way you do things here in Florida.  It's -- nobody cooks.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Well, I'm in Ohio.  I'd like to be in Florida but ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Especially this winter?
R:  Oh, yes.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's -- we're still feeling winter most days --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I think, so ...
L:  Really?  Oh, my.
R:  We made it to like eighty today.  That's been our high --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so far this year.  So ...
L:  Uh, we've been ninety.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  My little sister calls and tortures me.  She lives in St. Pete and --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- she'll call me and go, "Guess what?  It's ninety".  And then --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- she hangs up because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she knows I'm gonna hang --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- up on her otherwise.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Well it's -- it's a different lifestyle.  You eat out more and you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's a more outdoor life.  Uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the barbecues are year round.
R:  That's -- I know.
L:  Oh, that's something we enjoy too.  
R:  She's always calling me telling me about, "Oh, we went to the pier and ate this.  Or we went --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- to here and ate that".  And I'm like, "No.  That's not fair".  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, the barbecues are -- are fun.  Because you don't have to cook, uh, use a pot.  [LAUGH]  You know.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So you don't have to wash a pot afterward. 
R:  Yeah, we like barbecuing during the summer.  That's ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, we can do it year round here so that makes it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh ...
R:  Every once in a while we get brave and you open up the garage and you barbecue in the middle of the winter.  
L:  Really?  Well, I know my, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- son in law once did.  Uh, it was pouring rain and --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  -- and someone held an umbrella over him while [LAUGH] he barbecued.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  He said they --
R:  You see people --
L:  -- tasted very good.
R:  -- doing that every once in a while and ...  
L:  Oh.  Crazy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You just can't -- you get to craving it, you know.  
L:  [MN]  Oh, sure.  
R:  You think, oh, burger over --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- an open flame.  That's what --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I gotta have tonight.
L:  Charcoal.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  We -- we prefer the charcoal to the, uh, to the gas grill so we, uh -- we love that flavor.  Uh, [MN] and, uh, sometimes it's too hot here to barbecue so we -- we can't do it [LAUGH] in the summer.  Like the winter is perfect for it.
R:  Oh, my.  
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, uh, what type of, uh, food did you say you liked?  Casseroles?  
R:  Um, casseroles are fun 'cause they're something you can put in the oven.  I'm getting into my crock pot -- well, my slow cooker.  I don't --
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know what the difference between a crock pot and a slow cooker is but mine says --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- slow cooker.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And I know if I put crock pot recipes in [LAUGH] there it burns them.
L:  Really?
R:  So ...
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  I didn't know it either until one of my friends was like, "Oh, you gotta try this recipe" and I put it in there and it just burned it to a crisp.
L:  Oh.  Oh, my.
R:  And I was like, hm, there must be a temperature [NOISE] difference so ...
L:  Yeah.  Something is wrong.
R:  We -- we're starting --
L:  Something [MN] --
R:  -- to get into that.  My daughter's going to be five in August so she's starting to get into little -- little --
L:  Good.
R:  -- girl things and so --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- we're out running more so ...
L:  Okay.  
R:  I'm like well, I -- I want to cook but, you know ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can't ma-
