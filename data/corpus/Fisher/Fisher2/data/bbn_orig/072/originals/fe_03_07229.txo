R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Kathy.
R:  Hi, I'm Denise.  How are you --
L:  Denise?
R:  Yeah.  Hi, Kathy.
L:  It's nice -- nice to talk to you.
R:  You too.  
L:  What state are you in?
R:  I'm in Philad- I'm in Pennsylvania.  
L:  Pennsylvania.  That's where I'm originally from.  I'm in Florida now.
R:  Oh, wow.  You're so [LAUGH] lucky.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Actually I'd rather be in Pennsylvania. 
R:  Really?  'Cause it's hot?
L:  What was that?  
R:  'Cause it's hot?
L:  Yeah.  It's hot.  And I've been down here -- I've been down here almost nineteen years.
R:  Please, it just --
L:  Same old [MN] --
R:  -- got hot so you're very [LAUGH] lucky.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, okay.  So what kind of person are you?
L:  I'm the kind of person that used to be, um, I -- I have like sw- swung back full circle.  I used to be surrounded by, uh, what I would consider friends and acquaintances and it seemed like everywhere I knew somebody knew me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Then I switched to a few very close friends.  Uh, was burned by a couple of them and now I'm just now getting back to where I widen my circle again.  And, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- keep things to myself a little more.  
R:  Yeah.  Especially when it comes to female friends.  I think that's probably the safest bet.  Unfortunately.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, in my opinion.
L:  How -- how 'bout you?
R:  Me personally, I mean, I have, um, a lot of acquaintances, you know, but I have like the people I actually call my friends, you know, my mom told me that, um, if you can count, you know, the amount of friends on -- on one hand then you're good.  So --
L:  I've heard that before.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- I really --
L:  And it's true.
R:  Yeah.  You know, 'cause I know like I -- I too have -- have been in clicks, you know, before and I've been burned and, you know, I'm just e- especially not very good when it comes to female friends, especially.  But, um, like I only have a few, like, really good friends and, like, they're -- they're from undergrad but, you know, they're like disbursed.  Like, you know, a couple in New York.  One's in Virginia.  You know.  So they're all, like, all over the place.  So ...  You know, and I spend a lot of time by myself really.  
L:  How do you manage to do that?  Teach me something please.  
R:  No, it's just, I mean, like you said, it's just, you know, my -- true friends to me, at least, you know, kind of show themselves, otherwise I'm -- I'm more of a loner.  You know, i- it's --
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, it's nice to see people during the day but, like, when I come home I -- I -- it's like as I've gotten older I like my solitude.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, I --
R:  You know.
L:  -- see what you mean.  
R:  You know, acquaintances are good.  If I want someone to talk to, I can always call if I want to but, you know, sometimes I just remember my b- past bad experiences so it's like, yeah, I don't think I really want to go back to that.  
L:  Yeah, this is just all coming up on me pretty suddenly in a learning friendship lessons actually this week as we --
R:  Really?
L:  -- speak.  [LAUGH]  So ...  
R:  I'm so sorry.
L:  I'm -- I'll be going for the solitude too.  I have to pick caller ID back up on my phone and then I'll know when not to pick up the phone.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you have any guy friends?
L:  Uh, actually, um, I -- I'm newly married.  I've been married a year and a half.  I always did relate better to men than women.  Um, I don't have any guy friends right now because my husband is extremely the jealous type.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But I will be picking up those friendships pretty quick.
R:  Girl, I'll tell you.  Guys are so much better.  Like guys are great as friends.  Horrible as lovers.  You know what I'm saying?  Like when -- when sex and romance get in the picture then they get stupid.  
L:  Yes.
R:  But as friends they are the coolest.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know --
L:  And I notice they're --
R:  -- females --
L:  -- more reliable and more genuine.
R:  Right.  You know.
L:  When it's just a guy pal.
R:  What you see is what you get.  Females, you know, you never know.  Unfortunately.  You know.  'Cause, you know, it -- it's females, you know, tend to be petty sometimes and -- and really my female friends are those kinds of females that have more guy friends than girl friends.  So it's like they're kind of more like me.  It's weird but, I mean, that's like the way it is.  
L:  Yeah, it's hard to reestablish those friendships.  I'm not even sure all of them are still around here.  Um, it's awkward and tricky to pick something up like, you know, how do you explain I didn't have time for you for a couple of years, now I do?  You know.  So ...  I'm getting a divorce so ...
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, I'm not.  [LAUGH] 
R:  All [LAUGH] right.  
L:  First marriage.  Uh, waited a long time for it.  Thought I was doing something right.  Made a disastrous mistake.  
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  So, um, that's why I'm saying I'm learning all these -- all these lessons about friendship this week and how it's better to go back to my acquaintances, you know, what -- now when, um, somebody just says, "Hey, what are you -- how you doing?"  I'm gonna be -- a little more willing to say, "Great".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Than I normally would do.  'Cause I normally --
R:  I understand.
L:  -- open up to people.
R:  Totally understand.  It's just safer that way.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unfortunately.  You know.  But ...  I don't know.  It's just, y- you know, it really [MN] -- you want to know who my best friend is?  My mom.
L:  Sure.  Your mom?
R:  Mm.  My mom is my very best friend. 
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, and I'm very lucky to have her, you know, 'cause I didn't really -- she really didn't become my best friend, you know, probably couple a years ago when, you know, I'd been through everything with all my other girlfriends and the shadiness and, you know, and -- and it's like she's been my one true constant, you know, in so many ways and I'm very lucky.  You know, and I -- she's really all I need right now.  You know.
L:  Well, God bless your mom.  
R:  Well, thank you so much.
L:  I don't come from a real close family.  I come from a large family but, um, we're not close by any stretch of the imagination.  My mother is very judgemental and her favorite saying is, "Well, I told you, you should a ..." or "I told you, you shouldn't a ..." and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so it's when, you know, it's hard to talk to her and to even trust her.  
R:  Have you confided to her about this?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  And it's -- it got ugly so ...  It's all my fault, you know.  So ...  
R:  Oh, no, it's not.  
L:  So i- ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Mothers, they're weird people.  Trust me.  My mother and I, uh, hated each other for years.  And it didn't get good until recently so y- -- I'm -- I'm sorry that, um, you know, you don't have that.  
L:  Oh, I think I will eventually.  I think when my mother understands, yes, I can do this by myself and, yes, I have made mistakes and I am going to be pickier about who my friends are.  And ...
R:  And it's your life.  
L:  [inaudible].  Yeah.
R:  You know.  It's your life.  Not hers.
L:  Yeah.  None of this is getting me down.  I thought it would.  It's really not.  It's made me very determined.  Um, I can't believe how, I don't know how -- literally how tough I feel about the whole thing.  I think I can manage just fine.  
R:  Honestly, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And honestly that -- that's something I always say to myself.  And the second one is, God doesn't give us anything that we can't handle.  
L:  That's -- okay, so you're coming from the same field I am.  
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, that's -- that's one of my favorites too.  I'm new at this, uh, it's only been a couple a years but, um, I realize that my faith will get me through and I think my faith is why I'm not crumbling now like I have crumbled in the past.  
R:  And it's true.  You're gonna be a stronger and smarter person for it.  You know, after all I've been through I'm probably the smartest woman in the world.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, if you feel that way that's what you gets through.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  Basically.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Basically.
L:  What are --
R:  You know and --
L:  What kind of education do you have?
R:  Um, I'm in grad school.  
L:  You're in grad school?
R:  Yeah.  So it -- it -- you know, me being so busy, you know, with school and everything kind of helps me to not need to focus on other people so much.  
L:  May I ask what you're going for?
R:  Education, actually.
L:  Ed- -- oh, okay.  Good for you.
R:  Mhm.  You?
L:  Um, I'm a high school graduate.  
R:  Okay.
L:  That's trying to go to college and hitting stone wall after stone wall.
R:  Go.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  If anything, start at community college.  I did.  
L:  Yeah.  Well, community college is there for me.  But I'm s- -- uh, pardon the expression.  Not allowed.  So ...
R:  You're not allowed to go to community college?
L:  Right.  So it's -- and shortly I will be going.  I'm going to try to, um, I hope I have the wisdom that you have and the ability to deal with people that you have.  I've always prided myself on my people skills and that's why I've always done waitressing work.  And I realize that, uh, waitressing work is fine for a stepping stone.  But some people want -- my -- some of my friends choose to do -- do it their entire lives.  For me I'd like to do, uh, what I was meant to do.  And what I -- where I feel God is leading me is in the advertising sector.
R:  Good for you.
L:  Where I can be responsible for, you know, more positive advertising on TV.  More positive --
R:  Good for you.
L:  -- advertising on radio.  And I can meet a lot of people through college so that's a threat to somebody who's jealous.
R:  Hey, and --
L:  So ...
R:  Can I tell you one thing?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I worked as a waitress in undergrad.  So there you go.
L:  Okay.  And you -- were you able to put yourself through grad school or --
R:  Yes.
L:  [inaudible] to ...?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Well, see, I feel like I can do it.  
R:  There you go.
L:  I really -- I really do.  I feel like I can do it.  I feel like it's gonna take me longer than it should, you know, longer than it has to.
R:  As long as you do it.  Just do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Just focus on you.  On you and -- and -- and you -- you'd be surprised how much you can do.  [MN] Just forget everybo- everybody else.  Forget men.  Forget friends.  Forget everybody.  Just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- focus on you.  
L:  Except my kids. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  Oh, well there you go.
L:  Yeah, I got three kids.  Seven, eight, nine.  That's why it'll take me a little longer.  
R:  Oh, well, there you go.  Then that's your motivation right there.
L:  Yeah, they are.  They are one hundred percent pure motivation.  They're --
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  -- gifts from God.
R:  -- wonderful.  
L:  So ...
R:  Congratulations.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they're what I -- they're what I walk for.  They have shown me, um, you know, who true friends are.  The ones that have been there for me lately and --
R:  And there you go.
L:  -- the ones that don't ask a lot of questions and ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The ones that seem to understand and -- and, uh, I know I'll meet a few more through school and hopefully I can meet men that I can -- you know, because I can relate well to them but will accept friendship.
R:  Yes.
L:  And it can stop right there.  
R:  They -- they -- they will.  Trust me.  Guys flock to friendship.  Anything else serious, [MN] don't even worry about it.  But certainly[?] an undergrad, don't even look for it.  Because they're not even [several inaudible words] anyway.  You know, they --
L:  I'm embarrassed to admit to you that I don't really even know what undergraduate is.  Does that mean you went through four years of college and you're going on for something else now?
R:  Yes.  I'm getting --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- my second masters.  
L:  A second masters?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, Florida needs teachers like that.  [LAUGH]
