R:  Ah, good afternoon.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Frederick.
L:  Hi, I'm Bobbi.
R:  So the topic of today is food.
L:  Yeah, whether we --
R:  And which do we prefer, eating in a restaurant or eating at home?
L:  And our favorite meal.
R:  And our favorite meal.  Ladies first.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [PAUSE] well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of times I prefer eating out but my boyfriend's a pretty darn good cook.  So sometimes when I eat out I don't like it as much because it's not as well spiced.  I must say I -- I'm spoiled.
R:  I don't like to eat out either, Bobbi.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because I like to do my own cooking.  I like to prepare my own food.
L:  Yeah, are you a good cook?
R:  Yeah, I think so.  And I'm one of those type of men that after I eat a good meal I just want to, you know, open up my pants and sit on the couch for like a half an hour.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Sort of like the, um, guy on Married with Children? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]  No doubt.  So, um ...
L:  So what's your favorite meal?
R:  My favorite meal would have to be, um, ah, roast pork with, um -- [MN] with, ah, rice and, ah, green pigeon peas, which be -- would be in Spanish pernil arroz con gandules.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sounds neat.
R:  That would be, like, my -- my favorite meal.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like, um, this meal that y- you make.  I -- I was, um, selling time share and this couple came in and they were caterers.  And they taught me how to make a real quick meal, but it tastes great.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it's just chicken and you put in thousand island dressing, a thing of Limps -- Lipton onion soup and apricot marmalade and you mix all three of those together and coat it.  And it's phenomenal.
R:  [NOISE] That's like a goulash.
L:  Yeah.  It's phenomenal.
R:  [NOISE] Ooh.
L:  Even my brother likes it and he always hates the way I cook. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] What part of the country are you calling from?
L:  Rhode Island.
R:  Oh, eastern United States.  Well, I'm in New York.
L:  Do you ever go on Fat Wallet on the internet?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Do you ever, um, go on the internet?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  I -- I don't have a computer.
L:  Okay.
R:  No. [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Living in a computer age and I do not have a computer.
L:  Well, you're probably --
R:  But I'm into -- I -- I'm in one of the rest- -- I'm in the restaurant capital of the world almost, you know?
L:  Yeah, you can have any kind of food you want whenever you want it.
R:  That's right, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hey, I want, ah, Portuguese, I want Vietnamese --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of Chinese, you know.  Or French.  My grandmother lives, like, um, a few blocks away from restaurant row in Manhattan.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know.  But, um, it's too expensive dining out nowadays.
L:  Have you ever been to --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- restaurant dot com?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Oh, go to the library and get on the computer and go to restaurant dot com.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And you can bid on restaurant gift certificates worth twenty five dollars.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, and it's good all over the country.  We've used 'em from -- for when we travelled from Florida to Rhode Island.
R:  Mm.
L:  We've used them in Florida, we've used them in Baltimore, we used 'em in Rhode Island.  Used 'em in Massachussetts, and never had a problem.  You bid on -- you bid on, um, [LIPSMACK] the twenty five dollar gift certificates and you can win them starting at a dollar.  I usually win 'em at about five dollars.  So --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- they're pretty cool.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Because twenty five bucks you can usually go out to lunch, you know, and then it'll cost you about ten bucks more but ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] You know what I can do with twenty five dollars?
L:  What?
R:  [LAUGH] With twenty five dollars I can buy myself food for three or four days for my house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  But for five dollars, you can go out --
R:  Oh, but for five dollars, yeah.
L:  'Cause that's what you -- you win it for, five dollars.  I've been winning 'em for one dollar too.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Really?
L:  Yeah, because I -- 'cause I go there a lot and, you know, if -- if you check, you know, like every time you go to the library and --
R:  What kind of restaurants you get to go to, like, ah --
L:  Ah, a lot of 'em --
R:  -- three, four star restaurants?
L:  Well, no.  Ah, one of 'em's really good.  It's Ruthies, and the cook there is from Johnson and Wells called --
R:  You know, I was just about to tell you that, um, [LIPSMACK] I had went [MN] -- ah, when I went down to Virginia [NOISE] a couple of months ago I went to their Norfolk campus.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because I was, ah -- I took their tour.  And I -- I was interested, you know?  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I didn't know that that was a -- that's a very prestigious school.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  It's a four year school to l- -- to learn how to cook and restaurant business and what not.  And there's a lot of hard work behind it.
L:  Yup.
R:  But if someone is qualified -- I mean, they have dorms, they have internships and -- I mean, they practically sold me.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.  I --
R:  But, um, [MN] it -- they, um -- they're closing down their Norfolk campus I think, um -- I think they -- they're only going to have North Carolina and Florida.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, I -- I know they have other campuses, but they're closing down the Norfolk campus and I was --
L:  Yeah, the one in Rhode Island --
R:  -- thinking about moving down to Virginia.
L:  Yeah, it's better weather than New York.
R:  [LAUGH] Or Rhode Island for that matter.
L:  Yeah, you can say that again.
R:  So what's your favorite meal, that chicken thing?
L:  Well, no, that's my favorite one to cook because it's foolproof. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that one, two, three thing?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  You just throw in a -- a jar of either apricot j- j- jam or -- or marmalade and a packet of Lipton onion soup and a -- and a bottle of thousand island dressing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Stir it up and dump it on the chicken and it's incredible.  And -- and it's no talent or anything.  It's just throwing three [LAUGH] little things in a -- in a bowl. [NOISE]  But my favorite food to eat would be lobster, hands down, lobster.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Prepared what way?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] just -- just plain Cape Cod style.
R:  Oh.
L:  Thrown in a bucket and boiled with some clams.
R:  And just dip it in some butter sauce, huh?
L:  Yup.
R:  Mm.
L:  Brings back memories of growing up, because that's what we would do on a very special occasion, is we would have lobster.
R:  They do a lot of fishing out of Rhode Island, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I figured the shore is right there.  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  Well, back to the dining out thing.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  What other restaurants do you like?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] actually one of my favorite restaurants is a very landmark restaurant which isn't that expensive, is Juniors.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's famous for its cheesecake.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That sounds good.
R:  And it's right here in downtown Brooklyn.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it's not that expensive.  And, ah, Juniors is known worldwide.
L:  Oh.  If I ever -- if I'm driving down the road and see a Junior --
R:  No, there's only one Juniors.
L:  Oh, that -- it is?  There's only one.
R:  There's only one Juniors.  It's a landmark restaurant.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mhm.  It's, um -- [LIPSMACK] it's like sort of the -- the Maxim's of Brooklyn.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like the, um -- [LIPSMACK] they have a -- a famous soul food place up in Harlem, I forget the name of it.  Um, then there's, ah, this French restaurant that I went to once or twice.  It's on Fifty Seventh Street.  [NOISE] Oh my God, what is the name of that place?  [PAUSE] Something Something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It passes me by.  I haven't been dining out in a long time because I'm not working right now and, you know, you got to, like, really ...
L:  You know what you should do?
R:  No, what?
L:  Is you should become a mystery shopper and then you can eat out for free and make some extra cash.
R:  Yeah, I've thought about that.
L:  Yeah, I do it.
R:  I've thought about that.  But, um, see I was born and raised here in New York City and it's real tough having a car here, so I never like --
L:  A lot of 'em --
R:  -- have a car.
L:  -- will pay your bus fare.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Depends, yeah.  I know.  I -- I was an honesty shopper before.
L:  Oh, oh, right.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I worked, um, for a -- i- it's -- you're actually working for, um, a -- a protecting -- a protection agency --
L:  Oh.  Well this is m- --
R:  -- you know, a-- a security guard agency.  And, yeah, what they do is, you know, they sign -- they send you out to see if the cashiers are doing the work properly.
L:  Oh.
R:  To see if the salesmen are giving you the -- you know, the -- the sales bid policy that the store's instructed them to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like if you go like to, um, [LIPSMACK] a carpet place, you know, and the -- you know, you ask them, "Hey, can you show me a remnant of this carpet, this and that" and if they deal with you and what not.  They'd say, "Oh no, but I could get it and this and that".  You got to write all that down and you got to write a report.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  They allow you, like, maybe ten or fifteen dollars meal allowance.
L:  Yup.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] they, ah, put you up in like a -- these nowhere hot- -- motels.  Um, but it
