R:  [NOISE]  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  [NOISE]  Hi, my name is Debbie.
L:  My name is Mindy.
R:  Hi.  Um, so we're supposed to talk about foods?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you prefer eating in a restaurant or at home?
L:  Um, I prefer eating at home.  Um --
R:  At home?
L:  Yeah.  What about you?
R:  Um, [NOISE] well, we eat a lot of restaurant food but we eat it at home, so I'm kind of [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause I have two --
L:  You like restaurant food at home.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We have two little ones and so it's kinda hard sometimes to, uh, prepare things unless they're really simple, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  I don't necessarily like to cook at home but I like my food made at home.  I -- lately with everything in the news, you know, I -- I live in a metro city so you see a lot in the news about things and restaurants and stuff, so I'm kinda starting to get a phobia about some of the [LAUGH] things out there.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And so it's -- but --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- it's like just as bad in --
R:  There are a lot --
L:  -- a grocery stores though so ...
R:  Uh-huh.  But I think some of the meats, especially like in somewhere like McDonalds and some of the fast food ones are -- or In and Out burgers, or places like that.  
L:  Right. 
R:  And some of the -- even the chickens and stuff like at KFC I think they use a lot of hormones and different stuff with the ...
L:  I think so too.  And ...
R:  Yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's something to think about.
L:  Well, just -- just last week I went to, um, a restaurant and I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- looking at my lettuce really close.  We were eating salad.  I was eating with my daughter, and I was eating salad, and I was looking at it real close 'cause it had a few brown spots in it.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I flipped one over and there was a, like, a -- a bug.  It was like a little -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kinda like a fruit fly looking thing.  
R:  Ew.  [NOISE]
L:  And it just really turned my stomach for the whole rest of the meal because even though it wouldn't have hurt me if I'd a eaten it, it's just the thought of it being in there. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But ...  
R:  Did you say something then or ...?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Did -- did you say something at the restaurant then or ...?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I said something to the, um, uh, to the waitress and they ended up, um, comping my part of the meal.  And, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so we only had to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pay for my daughter's but, um, still.  I, you know, it didn't really benefit me that good because I [LAUGH] didn't eat it.  'Cause --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I just didn't feel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I didn't feel good about any of it after I found that so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Huh, well ...
L:  But my daughter enjoyed it.  She still ate all of hers.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's too bad that that happened though.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That would be kind of gross. 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  At least [MN] my friend said at least it wasn't a roach, you know, I -- I probably would a gotten out of and walked out of if it had been a roach.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So recently in the news somebody found like a lizard, the head of a lizard or something in the [NOISE] salad or something and then the restaurant after that they made a disclaimer that they were only gonna use like, uh, packaged lettuce that was already cut up and stuff like that instead of, you know, using the whole [LAUGH] head of lettuce.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, wow.  
R:  Oh, gross, that they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- didn't ...
L:  Ew.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well that --
R:  Don't even --
L:  I think --
R:  Yucky.  Yucky.
L:  -- would've been upset if I'd a found that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, you got to be careful about your food.  That's for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you belong to, uh, Refund Cents?
L:  Um, no.  Is it ...?
R:  No?  It's just a, uh, internet site.  It's about like, uh, couponing and stuff like that.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they have a lot of really good deals for shopping and stuff like that.  You might look at it some time.  It's interesting.  
L:  Is it just refund cents dot com?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have to check it out 'cause I do a lot of freebie boards and, you know, stuff like survey sites and stuff.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that -- I'll have to check that out too.  
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's really neat.  There's like sixteen thousand people or something and they -- everybody's like, you know, tells you the buzz about shopping and stuff.  It's a really cool site.
L:  Yeah, I'll have to check that out.
R:  They've been talking about this, uh, research thing so that's why I was wondering if maybe you were on it.  The [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, they been talking about this?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I found it on my survey site.  [LAUGH] 
R:  On your survey site?
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I can't remember the name of the -- it's, uh, I don't even remember the name of the form.  I just have it saved in my favorites so I never even pay attention to it anymore.  
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  
L:  But I just go in there and look to see what surveys are, you know, like Greenfield on line, I do them.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Sometimes.  And stuff.
R:  Do you like that one or ...?  I've only done like -- I got like two dollars [several inaudible words] they hardly ever --
L:  The only thing --
R:  You have to look for surveys all the time instead of them like contacting --
L:  The only thing I've done good with them is the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a couple of times I've qualified for, um, the hour survey and gotten twenty dollars.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And I've done that about three times.  And --
R:  And they contacted you about that or you have to keep looking on there?
L:  Well, when you fill out the surveys --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they'll s- they'll say at the end of it if -- if -- if you qualify for, you know, to go on.  They say they might contact you and then they'll contact you by email.  Everything's done online.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  And so I've done that a few times and, you know, you can sit in your pyjamas and do the survey instead of going out and doing one at a research place or [LAUGH] something.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I just got back from doing one of those.  And I got to leave immediately.  I didn't have to go through it.  Got seventy five dollars for sit- sitting there for about fifteen minutes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  Well, that's nice.
L:  I didn't have to go through it.  Yeah, that was really nice.  
R:  Those ones, they're not kid friendly though or you can do a panel like that if you have children with you?  Or how does that work?
L:  Um, uh, I've never -- I didn't do them when my daughter was smaller so I'm not sure.  I've never --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- seen people -- I've --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- seen people come in there with kids but they usually have somebody else with them so -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I haven't -- I haven't actually seen them, like, bring them in to the, uh, focus group.  
R:  Yeah.  That'd probably be kind of distracting.
L:  Yeah, um, I think a lot of people do mystery shopping.  Now I haven't done that.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]
R:  No, I haven't done that either.  
L:  I think a lot of people do that 'cause they can take their kids with them.  One of the lady's yesterday, I was doing a focus group yesterday, and she mentioned that she does a lot of that so she can take her ten, uh, ten week old with her.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But ...  I, uh -- do you do much --
R:  Do you use a lot of coupons and stuff when you -- 'cause you said you like to eat things at home and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah, I do.  
R:  You're into coupons?
L:  [MN]  Sunday paper.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Mostly.  And occasionally I find a lot of good ones on the internet.  I use 'em if -- when I do eat out if -- if it's a place, you know, I try to use them there too.  
R:  Yeah, like the entertainment book?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I love that book.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I love that book 
R:  They're -- they're having a really good deal on it right now too.  Did -- did you know it's like ten dollars with five dollars shipping?
L:  Oh, no, I didn't.
R:  You can get 'em for fifteen bucks now.  From their site.  
L:  Is it from this -- this years?
R:  Yeah.  This years.  
L:  [MN]  This years?
R:  'Cause it's like half of the year is over, they're trying to c- clear 'em out now so ...
L:  Yeah.  I have to check that out too.  I always like getting 'em.  I like to get 'em -- to get 'em from where my sister lives because she never buys one.  But when we go to visit we like to eat out up there.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so ...
R:  Yeah, at that price [NOISE] a lot of people there are buying 'em even to go on vacation and stuff like that 'cause if you're gonna be in another area, even for a few days, but the only thing is, is then you've got to hunt for those restaurants, you know.
L:  Right.  It -- but it -- if it saves money, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  A lot of time.
R:  Save a lot of money.  
L:  I mean use it once or --
R:  We buy multiples.
L:  -- twice it -- it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- paid for itself.  
R:  And now they have grocery store coupons, at least --
L:  Our --
R:  -- in our area.
L:  Yeah, ours does too.
R:  Like [MN] five dollars off of fifty and stuff.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That really adds up.  People really like those.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I do too.  I love those.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  When I first started getting the entertainment book it -- it had, um, coupons for two of my grocery stores and now one of 'em has quit doing it but they would have coupons for, like, free eggs with no other purchase and for --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- free bread and things like that.  I mean, it was just cheap things but still stuff you buy everytime you go to the store.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they stopped doing that.  And one of the grocery stores still does it.  And I always -- I don't shop there very often but I shop there and I -- you know, I'll go and shop there once every now and then just to use my coupon.  
R:  Yeah.  That's a good deal.  And eggs or something, like they don't usually get a coupon too often for those.  
L:  No.  [MN]  Sometimes Egglands Best, but I don't know if that's in your part of the country or not.  But [MN] sometimes we get 'em for that brand but that brand -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is so much higher that even if they double the coupon it doesn't save me that much money.  I mean, enough money to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because they're so much higher than the store brand eggs.
R:  They're having them -- some coupons yesterday, I was at the market and they have the, uh, I think it's, uh, the muffin mixes.  I think it was Betty Crocker or ...  I'm not sure of the maker but the -- it was either like Betty Crocker's or Pillsbury.  The muffins.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you buy two blueberry muffin mixes then you get a free eggs.  But the only thing is, is it was like up to a dollar ten and my eggs are like two twenty nine.  [LAUGH]  'Cause I bought six of the muffins and I thought, "Oh, I'll get three free eggs".  But then they weren't free.  So it was like, oh, better return a couple.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  'Cause, uh, you have to read the fine print on those things though, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, we buy a lot of, um, uh, like, uh, um, wholesale clothes.  I don't [MN] again I don't -- I don't know what they have there but like Sams and Kosco.
R:  And Kosco, yeah.  We have Kosco here.  
L:  And, um, we buy a lot of things there.  Lately, we've been buying a lot of chicken but it's like one of my friends said.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The chicken breasts are so big you know those chickens are shot up with something because [LAUGH] that's not what they look like when we used to -- you know, used to buy 'em when I was growing up.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're just huge.  
R:  Yeah.  They are huge.  That's true.
L:  Even the -- the frozen Tyson brand.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and stuff.  But that's what we use.  That and my dau- my daughter's real funny.  She'll only eat stuff off a the bone.  She won't eat --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- anything on the bone.  So we have to buy the boneless breast and like boneless pork chops and things like that.  Like she won't eat anything on the bone.
