R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, how are you?
R:  I'm fine.  Who --
L:  I'm Dee.
R:  I'm Bill --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from LA.
L:  Glad to talk to you.
R:  Good to talk to you.  I'm glad I finally got to talk to somebody.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They put me on hold for like ten minutes.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a long time to be on ho- -- on hold.
R:  I know, I was about to hang up, like --
L:  Well, yeah, I could understand that.  So do you talk to a lot of people?
R:  Um --
L:  Do you have lots of friends?
R:  -- no not really.
L:  Not really?
R:  I don't -- see, I don't trust people that much.
L:  Uh-huh.  I can understand that one.
R:  You know, live -- I live in a big city, so it's like ...
L:  Oh, where do you live?
R:  In LA.
L:  Oh, really?  Oh that is a big [LAUGH] city.
R:  How are you --
L:  I could understand not trusting anybody. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  I live in a really small little tiny town.
R:  No kidding?  Where is it?
L:  Yep, I'm in Idaho.
R:  Wow.
L:  Really tiny town.  It's a farming community.
R:  What's the --
L:  There's two lights in the whole town.
R:  -- what's the population?
L:  Um, oh, I don't even know.  I'm new enough down here, I don't know.  [LAUGH] Isn't that terrible?
R:  Is it less than, like, a few thousand?
L:  Yeah, ah, yeah, I guess so.  Probably about that.
R:  That must be a lot of fun.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's kind of nice though.  I -- well, I'm from Texas and we moved down here.  But I'm -- I'm from smaller town down in Texas too, so ...
R:  Wow, that's cool.
L:  But everybody in Texas is real friendly, so I'm used to people talking to each other and ...  They'll go down and sit in restaurants and somebody in a restaurant will talk -- be talking to somebody else in a restaurant. [LAUGH]  It's the way it is in Texas anyway.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  So I'm used to people talking a lot.
R:  -- I was in Texas, like, once and everybody was really friendly, like --
L:  Yeah, they're very friendly down there.  That's one thing I do miss about Texas.  Ah, you know, it's like the only thing I miss about Texas, but I do [LAUGH] --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- do miss that.
R:  --  I heard you could see like UFO's and, like, the pan handle.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Have you heard of the pan handle?
L:  Yeah, I heard that before too.
R:  Have you?
L:  Um, like Roswell area or something like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I've never seen anything.
L:  No, I've never seen any either. [LAUGH]
R:  That's --
L:  Well, I'll be.
R:  -- my friend said he saw one coming back from Vegas.
L:  Did he really?
R:  He was probably drinking or something like that.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  Probably. [LAUGH]  So do you have just a few close friends then?
R:  Yeah, I've got -- I tend to surround myself with, like, people that I could -- they don't give me any problems, like -- if they cause me stress then, you know, I -- I have to get rid of 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they've got to be positive too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They can't be -- I don't like negativity because it kinda drains me.
L:  What kind of job do you work at?
R:  Ah, I go to school right now.
L:  Do ya?
R:  I'm studying, ah -- well, I want to study nutrition.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  How 'bout yourself?
L:  Oh, I -- well, I'm -- I've gone to -- [LIPSMACK] actually I'm s- staying home watching my six children right now but -- I know, that's a lot of kids.
R:  That's a --
L:  Anyway. [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] that's a full time job.
L:  But I'm also going -- going to school in between that, so ...
R:  Well, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, for communications and psychology.
R:  You go to school?
L:  Mm.
R:  Oh, oh okay.  That -- you go to school part time?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I went full time for a little while there and then I went to part time, and now I'm just taking a break right now.  We've, ah -- [LIPSMACK] it's kind of a long story, but they just kind of cut out the -- the area.  The closest school to us is, like, half an hour away but it's in another state.  I'm right on the border of the state.  So you -- you end up having to pay ate -- out of state tuition even though they're like half an hour away.
R:  Wow.
L:  So it's kind of stupid.  I'm so ma- -- I'm having to go the other way, which is like an hour and a half to go to school.  And doing that with six kids is just crazy, so -- so I'm taking a break for a little while 'til I get my youngest one in --
R:  The school I go to, we --
L:  -- or she's going in to school longer.  Huh?
R:  In the school I go to we get -- we have a lot of people from, ah, like the Middle East and, ah --
L:  Really?
R:  They pay a lot -- they pay like a hun- -- almost two hundred dollars a unit I think.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I only pay twelve 'cause I'm a resident.
L:  Wow.
R:  So it's really cool.
L:  How much school do you have left?
R:  Ah, about two more years.
L:  Do ya?
R:  I'm kind of -- you know, I have kind of a -- I haven't been very, you know -- I'm not a hard working student, you know?  I'm not -- I kind of screwed around for a while.
L:  [LAUGH] Don't we all at first?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Let's take all of the easy classes and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- all the fun classes and --
R:  I was taking, like, you know, music appreciation, art appreciation.
L:  Yeah, I took those too. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, did you?  Did you --
L:  I did.  That's what I said, you take all the easy ones first.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I took drawing, you know?  That's like a really important one to psychology, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It was like drawing that'll be good.  Anyway they -- they're were just telling me, "Oh, just take what you want, you know?  Don't -- don't really worry about it".  I'm like, "Okay, sounds good to me".
R:  Yeah, I hear that --
L:  I'll fake my way through for a while.
R:  My friend was taking a yoga class and he got kicked out of that for some reason.
L:  [LAUGH] Kicked out of yoga?
R:  I couldn't believe it.  K- -- I never heard anyone be kicked out of like a PE class.
L:  [LAUGH] That's -- well, ah, yeah, that is kind of wild.  So you're into nutrition again?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love nutrition.  Ah, we do --
R:  Do you?
L:  -- herbs and stuff like that here at the house.  I, ah -- I've -- I've  always been real into that stuff, so [MN] I think it's pretty cool.
R:  That's cool.
L:  I -- I -- in fact I thought about going through it -- through that same thing.
R:  Yeah, I've been getting into, like, getting a lot of -- buying my organ- -- some organic vegetables and juicing them.
L:  Yeah.  Juices do you really a lot of good.  So what are you going to do with it when you get out?  You get your degree and everything, you going to work in a hospital or you gonna work in --
R:  I --
L:  -- have your own place or ...?
R:  I -- I want to start my own publishing company and, ah, I want to publish books on nutrition and --
L:  Oh, that'll be good --
R:  -- alternative health.
L:  -- I'll be buying your books then. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I want to give people a voice, because they -- a lot of people can't get their books published.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I write books too, but ...
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah, no.  On the side, you know, got to do, be all.  Yeah, that's why I'm going through the jour- -- um, journalism and communications.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, that's what I do --
R:  Well, you do it all then.
L:  -- is do a lot of writing.  Huh?
R:  You do it all.  You got, what, six kids?
L:  I know.  I like to do everything. [LAUGH]  That's why I have --
R:  Do you sleep?
L:  -- such a hard time.
R:  You ever sleep?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you ever sleep?
L:  Oh, yeah, sometimes. [LAUGH]  Not as much as I probably should but --
R:  Like two hours at --
L:  -- no, it -- it works out okay.  I -- I guess I just kind of like to juggle everything I guess and I'm real bad about that.  But I love to do everything, so I had a really hard time trying to pick my major.  That's why I ended up kind of slowing down a little bit, going, "Well ...".  Like liberal arts would be a better one for me 'cause it [LAUGH] just kind of covers everything.
R:  Yeah, that's a good one.
L:  But I had a hard time with that.  But anyway ...  Sounds like you're -- you're busy too though.  LA is a really busy area though, isn't it?  
R:  Yeah, it's pretty stressful.  I mean --
L:  Is it?
R:  It sure isn't -- you probably can't relate to and I -- I can't relate to Idaho.
L:  Well, I don't think I could relate to -- I don't think I could handle it.
R:  No, I --
L:  It's just too fast paced.  My mother in law goes up there -- ah, my mother and father in law go up there, like, every year to go to New York, and, um, go up to New York.  Anyway, anyway, they said it's just like crazy.  I mean, they just said, [LAUGH] "We can't even relate, you know, just to get in --"
R:  You mean New York state?
L:  Mm?
R:  New York City or ...?
L:  Yeah, New York City.  But they go up to New York but -- and -- and they can't relate to that, but that's what I think of.  When I think of LA that's the kind of lifestyle [LAUGH] I think of.  But it's probably not that bad.  But I always think of New York City being just as fast as that, as LA.
R:  Mm, I think New York is worse because --
L:  You think so?
R:  -- here you can go --
L:  I've never been to either one, but ...
R:  The people are more densely packed.  Here you can go where -- you know.
L:  At least you can move around a little bit, huh?
R:  There's more parks and stuff.  You can go to the mountains.
L:  But the cost of living is so high.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It is, huh? [MN]
R:  Well --
L:  My friend was telling me that they were renting a place in what would cost us about between four and six hundred dollars a month, would cost them, you know, between a thousand and fifteen hundred dollars a month.  For the same thing.  Or act- -- for less.  The -- you can get a house down here between four and six hundred dollars a month for a two, three bedroom house.
R:  Wow, that's excellent.
L:  Yeah.  That's just to --
R:  Here it would be like --
L:  -- you know, rent.
R:  -- fifteen hundred.
L:  Do what?
R:  It would be like fifteen hundred over here.
L:  Yeah.  See, my daughter is renting a place right now and they're only paying four hundred and fifty dollars a month right now.  And it's got three bedrooms, or two bedrooms, I mean.  And, ah, it's huge, it's a really huge place.  It's the top part of a house, you know?  Then there's, like, people li- -- renting underneath 'em.  And, ah, you know, place for a washer and dryer and everything.  And my friend says, [LAUGH] "You know, that's incredible 'cause up here that would cost us so much".  So ...  And she lives out- outside of LA.  Can't remember --
R:  Wow, that's awesome.
L:  -- the area.
R:  How much is, ah, like a house?  Like a --
L:  To buy a house?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it depends on -- on what you're getting.  I mean, you know, like a hundred and -- hundred and twenty thousand is like really high down here.  And that's just, you know, three bedrooms or whatever.  You know, that's -- between sixty five thousand and a hundred and twenty thousand for a three bedroom.
R:  Wow.
L:  It's really not -- that's not bad.  So ...
R:  How's the crime rate?
L:  Crime rate's not bad at all down here, you know.  I know that --
R:  And h- --
L:  -- they have it, but it's not, you know, it's not horrible.  [MN] In fact we were talking to somebody the other day who said that they bought a cabin up in the mountains they're going to rent out to people who want to come down from LA in that area, and come down here and rent a cabin for, you know, them and their, you know, spouses or whatever, and then come down here and stay.  And then, um -- oh, anyway. [LAUGH]  I'm sorry, my friend just came in and asked me a question.  Anyway, [MN] they're going to rent -- rent it and then come back and forth, you know, just to stay for the -- for a visit and then go back.  So I -- I [LAUGH] -- I guess people want to come out here and think that this is wonderful, you know?  And we'd probably want to go there and visit, so 
R:  Yeah, people from, ah, out here go to, like, Colorado or somewhere.
L:  Yeah.  Grass is always greener, you know.
R:  Yep.
L:  [LAUGH] Although I can't -- I couldn't imagine living in a big city.  My, um, par- -- um, my aunt lives in Merced.  Well, she lived in Merced, California.  And then moved over to, like, Hidden Valley. [LAUGH]  She thought that was really funny.  Like, that's a ranch dressing, that's not a place.  But anyway --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- she lives in Hidden Valley. [LAUGH]  But anyway, she loves it up there and it's beautiful.  I'm mean, you guys have all the green.  It's -- it's really pretty up there and everything, but it -- you know, it is fast pace, so ...
R:  You mean Hidden Valley up -- up by, ah, up here, or down here?
L:  I -- I don't know exactly where it's at in California.
R:  'Cause I think there's --
L:  We've been there to visit and I'm geographically stupid, so I couldn't tell you one way or the other. [LAUGH]  But --
R:  A lot of these towns have, like, similar names, so it's kind of hard. 
L:  Yeah, well, it's Hidden Valley and then it's part of something else, you know?  It's not -- Hidden Valley's th- -- like the suburb of wherever this is.  And I can't remember what it is.  I always forget.  I always remember the Hidden Valley.  But wherever it is, it's where they do grapes a lot.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  'Cause there were grape vineyards all over the place out there.
R:  All right.
L:  So ...  But that's -- she just moved down there and then they've got all this -- this fancy little house and everything now. [LAUGH]  It's a little -- the people that they were living with have this big hot tub and all -- you know, I mean, it's just like fancy.  I'm like, "Oh, it's nice", but [SIGH] I guess we'll just stick to Idaho [SIGH] for a while.
R:  Probably a good place --
L:  One of these days we'll visit.  Huh?
R:  It's a good place to raise kids probably.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, it's all right.
