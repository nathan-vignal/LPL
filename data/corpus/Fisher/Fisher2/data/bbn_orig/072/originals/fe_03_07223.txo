R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I am good.  
R:  Good, and my name's Lucia. 
L:  I'm Krishna[?].
R:  What is your name?
L:  Krishna.
R:  Krishna, where are you from?
L:  I'm from, ah, Florida.
R:  Oh, ah, where's your -- where's that name from, I should ask. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's, ah, that's Hindu.
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  You know, like Hare Krishna.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Lucia, that's a --
R:  Lucia.
L:  -- Spanish. 
R:  Huh?
L:  Lucia?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's either Italian or Spanish.
R:  Ye- -- it's an Italian name, but I'm Hispanic, I'm from Nicaragua. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  That's exciting.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, so you have lots of friends? [NOISE] 
L:  Ah, no. [LAUGH] 
R:  No? [LAUGH] 
L:  Not at all. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, how 'bout you?
R:  I know a lot of people, but there's only about one or two that I consider a friend. 
L:  Ah. 
R:  Yeah, but I'm very social.  
L:  I can be social, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I kinda prefer to keep to myself as much as possible. 
R:  Yeah, you're probably really smart, aren't you?
L:  No, not --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I don't know. 
R:  [LAUGH] "No", he says. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I can't answer that truthfully, I guess.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Or objectively. 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Ah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- you live in Florida, you don't have very many friends, hang out on the beach and do whatever not? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well I mean it's, like, I guess my friends kinda come -- kinda comes in waves, you know --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- like I tend to, um, I don't know, I have a few close friends --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, like, I guess it kind of -- I don't know, we really get to know each other and usually at some point things kind of [MN] -- we come head to head and things kinda fall apart. 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, that's the pattern that I've f- found at least.
R:  Yeah. [LIPSMACK] Oh, that's --
L:  So ...
R:  -- that's too bad.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  [MN] Well, like --
L:  You have a few close friends, but ...
R:  Yeah, I have -- I have maybe two very close friends, but even then I don't -- I -- it's not like -- I'm not the type of person who's gonna, like, go out of my way to call somebody every day. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, my, yeah, my friends just have to be -- that's why I don't have very many friends, 'cause I guess --
L:  They must --
R:  -- nobody wants to be my friend. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's probably not true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You're probably just --
R:  Well, it's not -- [NOISE]
L:  -- you probably -- you -- you probably lead a pretty busy life.  Where -- wait, where are you from?
R:  Ah, Virginia.
L:  Virginia?
R:  About fifteen minutes from D.C.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Awesome. 
R:  Yeah.  So, um, no, it's not that -- I don't know, its not that I can't keep a friend or anything, but, like, once I become friends with somebody a lot -- I find that a lot of people are really needy and they need somebody to call them every day, like, three times a day and I'm not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'm not -- I'm not that type of person.
L:  Ah. 
R:  No, I --
L:  No, me -- yeah --
R:  -- like, you know, if you're my friend you have you call me. [LAUGH] 
L:  Actually I don't really -- I -- I really don't like the phone all that mu- -- I mean, I  -- I don't hate it, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, my preferred way of conversation is face to face. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And, like, I really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, to be truthful about it, I don't like hanging out with a lot of people, usually. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I can have fun --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, have a few drinks and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, I really enjoy, um, like, intimacy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean not just, like, sexual intimacy --
R:  Right, right right.
L:  -- but like, um, just the intimacy you get with just a few people.
R:  One on one, or ...
L:  One on one, one on two, you know, du- -- when it's just a few people, it's -- things to me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- feel more honest --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and there's less of that social kind of B.S. going on.
R:  Right. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  See, I'm, no, I'm more of a -- there's gotta be twenty people there.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they're not going to all be my friends, but, you know ...
L:  Just yeah, yeah.
R:  I kinda get along with everybody and I like lots of noise and lots of action and excitement and, you know, things going on all around me and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, that can be fun too.  We -- well, we sound like kinda opposites on the --
R:  Yeah we do.
L:  -- on the [inaudible].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] We do.  Where in Florida do you live?
L:  In Tallahassee.
R:  In Tallahassee.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  Oh ...
L:  You know where that is?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My brother lives in Miami.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  About -- about twenty five minutes from South Beach.  I just actually came back from there on Monday. [MN]
L:  Oh. 
R:  Yeah. 
L:  [inaudible]
R:  We couldn't go out though, couldn't go out.
L:  Did you fly?
R:  Huh?
L:  Did you fly?
R:  Yes. 
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I, um, yeah, I wanted to, like, go out to a club or something like that, but I couldn't 'cause I -- I took -- I -- I have a three month old --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- yeah, and I -- I took her with me and --
L:  That's probably not --
R:  -- not much you can do [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with a three month old. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know. [LAUGH] That's not a good idea to take your three year old with you --
R:  No. 
L:  -- to clubs.
R:  But we hung out at the beach for a little while.
L:  That's cool. 
R:  People watching.
L:  That's cool.  Beach is nice.  People watching is nice. 
R:  Yeah, I love people watching.  See, that's why I need to have, like, a lot of people around me and I love talking about people.
L:  That's true, like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I can, I mean, I like, that's -- that's another reason I like being around people, 'cause, I mean, I do like talking to people and I like meeting new people and everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, I mean, when it comes down to it, like, as far as preference it's, like, I'd rather -- I'd rather not have a huge crowd to deal with or whatever.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But, um --
R:  [SIGH] I --
L:  Whatever.
R:  -- like the noise.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's like you -- I -- I'm always -- always out.  When -- when my baby was, like, gosh, I think she was, like, four days old, and I was out in the mall and people were going, "How old is your baby?" "Four days". "Like, why are you out of your house?" [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you married?
R:  Like why -- yeah, I am.  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, like your husband, I guess. 
R:  He's -- yeah, he's always working though, so ... [SIGH]
L:  But, I mean, you consider him, like, I guess, best friends or whatever?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  He's -- he's one of the two. [LAUGH] 
L:  One of the two.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [NOISE] But see, and I -- our -- our -- our -- our, ah, sorry, I argue with him all the time, because he's got, like, a group of twenty friends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're -- they all consider each other their best friend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm going, "How can you have twenty best friends?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's just not possible.  You know, there's gotta be, like, one person that you single out or two people that you single out as your best, best friend.
L:  Yeah, you have to discriminate some way.
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the rest are just acquaintances, people you know, you know. 
L:  Maybe they're --
R:  He's like --
L:  Maybe they're all --
R:  -- "No, we're all best friends --"
L:  -- just acquaintances and to him best friends aren't as close as what you mean --
R:  No --
L:  -- best friends to be.
R:  -- you'd be surprised.  
L:  Really?
R:  If you ask any of them, it's -- they -- they won't choose one over the other.
L:  Well, that's kinda cool. 
R:  Yeah --
L:  In some ways. 
R:  -- although it kinda bothers me. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Not that it affects me in any way, but, I mean, it kinda -- it just bugs me.  It's, like, how can you [NOISE] -- how can you be -- 'cause if you have a best friend, it's because you're really, really, really close to that person. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  How can you be so close to so many people?
L:  Wow, I don't know.
R:  It's just not -- ah, I don't know.  That's just me.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's kinda the way I feel too.  'Cause it's, like, I feel like you can either be close to a few people or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of spread yourself thin with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of people, you know.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And, I mean, I'm sure there's -- there's -- I'm sure there's ways to not do that, you know, but, ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I just -- I've -- in my experience I found that, you know, you just kinda sp- spread yourself thin and --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I don't know, plus, like, I just don't like to -- to waste too much time doing social stuff 'cause I got, like, other stuff I'm doing, so ...
R:  Oh.  You go to school and stuff, or no ...?
L:  I --
R:  You sound young, that's why I'm asking.
L:  Mm, what's that?
R:  I said you sound young [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's why I asked about school. [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I sound young, well, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, yeah, I guess I was in school just a little while ago.  But I kinda quit, almost --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- before I finished.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What were you studying?
L:  Ah, commercial photography.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  Why did you quit that?
L:  Well, I kind of accomplished what I -- I -- or I did accomplish what I wanted to accomplish with it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and my parents wanted me to finish it and I wanted to, but the situation was that, like, I had to focus my attention somewhere else.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was, like, it was a college, but at the same time it was a little bit different, it was like a vocational --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so they -- it's, like, almost like you're back in high school.  It's, like, you go to school from eight o'clock in the morning until two thirty straight --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- every day. 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  And it's, like, how am I supposed to pay my rent, how am I supposed to get a job --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and it -- it just -- my money ran out, and so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and plus, like, I had to focus my attention --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- towards other things so ...
R:  [NOISE] So you're not married or anything?
L:  No, I'm not.  I don't -- ah, I'm not a marriage person.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what you say now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No -- no, that's what I say.  That's what I say. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, how old are you?
R:  I'm twenty six.
L:  See, I'm -- we're not that much apart -- I'm twenty five, so ...
R:  You're twenty five.  Oh, I see. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought you sounded young. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's young sort of. 
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is! [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You have to say,  "It is".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah,
R:  I'm twenty six, so twenty five is really young.
L:  Twenty five, oh, man, we're babies, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] We are. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, but yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you'll be saying that when you're forty.
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] So, how old are you, thirty nine? Oh, yeah, you're young. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, it is a state of mind. 
R:  [LAUGH] It is.
L:  So, so wait, did -- you don't go to school any more, or ...?
R:  No.
L:  You finished?
R:  Uh-uh.  Yeah, I graduated last May --
L:  In?
R:  -- got married a week later --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- had a baby nine months later. [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  What -- what did you get a degree in?
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, psychology and elementary education.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm -- I'm certified to be a teacher, but I got pregnant right away, so I didn't wanna start teaching just yet.
L:  Wow, I'm sure you're doing plenty of teaching in --
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH] With --
L:  -- to one.
R:  -- my own.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah. [MN] I'm loving it. 
L:  That's cool.
R:  She's fun. [NOISE]
L:  That's cool.  Kids are interesting.
R:  They're fun. [NOISE] Especially when they're -- they're -- they're your own.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  I will never know. 
R:  Yes, you will.
L:  I will never know. 
R:  Yes, you will.
L:  Never, ever, ever, ever, ever.
R:  Why never ever?
L:  Oh, I just think I'm too independent. 
R:  Oh, whatever. [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, it's -- it's --
R:  You'll grow out of that. [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I've -- I've met some really cool girls and, you know, like, I mean, I'm in love with somebody right now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, and if I -- I guess I could take it to, like, the next level if we really wanted to, but I don't know, we're both pretty independent so ...
R:  She feels the same way; she doesn't want to get married?
L:  Yeah, that's what she says.
R:  Yeah, that's what she says.
L:  That's what she says.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what my brother said about his girlfriend.  He was, like, "No, no, no, we don't wanna get married, do we?"  And she's, like, "Well ..."
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, one day. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  One day it came to, "Well, I kinda do want a family".  And now they're --
L:  Yeah, she's --
