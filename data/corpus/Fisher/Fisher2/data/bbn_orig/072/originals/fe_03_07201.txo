R:  Hi --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my name is Loretta.  
L:  Hi, I'm Carey.
R:  +Hi.  [LAUGH]  [MN]  Where do you live?
L:  Um, in Illinois.  [LAUGH]  [MN]
R:  +Okay.  And I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, my.  So [MN] -- my parents just got back from Pittsburgh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  
L:  So ...  They went out there for a little while.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Did they go with friends?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, no, they didn't.  They went by theirself.  I guess they would be their own [LAUGH] friends.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  And so ...  But ...  Um, I guess I would say my mom's my best [LAUGH] friend.
R:  Well, that's nice.  I -- I wish my mom was mine but we're -- we're apart.  She lives in Florida.
L:  Oh, my.  My mom only lives, um, [LIPSMACK] like a half a mile, three four seven mile.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's nice.  Do you see her everyday?
L:  [MN]  Basically, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Do you talk to your mom a lot or ...?
R:  No.  [MN]
L:  No?  
R:  [MN] And that's a shame.  I mean, I do have a -- I have a close, well, I guess one, yeah, two close friends.  One really close and we check in, sort of, like everyday.  Like I -- like I should be doing with my mother.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [MN] my mother is like really, um, critical.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  A- and [MN] in things that I, you know, you'd want to tell your mother, you really can't, so you have to make up stuff.
L:  Oh, my.  Yeah, that --
R:  So what's the point?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, yeah, the- these are the things that, you know, I tell my other friend, my friend.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's who you tell it too then.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I guess I have another close friend.  Which my mom's close in age too.  Are you guys further apart in age or ...?
R:  Well, I'm fifty one and my mother's, um, um, she -- I guess she's eighty?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess, well, no, I guess that's not all that close, huh?
L:  No.  My -- I'm twenty -- I had to think for [several inaudible words].  I'm twenty five and she's forty [MN].  Trying to think.  Forty three?  Forty two.  So we're seventeen years, so that kind of makes, I think --
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  So that kind of makes a difference, I think.  Maybe an age difference.
R:  Mhm.  Well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's good.  
L:  And so ...  But, yeah.  And then I have another friend.  She's a few years older than me and basically kids I went to -- or p- people I went to school with I emailed, you know, or something like that but not -- not those relationships you had in school you really don't have now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  
L:  And so ...  So how did you meet your friend?  Through work or acquaintance?
R:  Oh, you -- I think -- I think it was work related.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, it was work related 'cause my closest friend, I've been friends with her since, let me see, it's -- my son is twenty two and it -- I think almost all of his life so that's a long time.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  About twenty one years.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was work related.  Yeah.  
L:  So that's how you --
R:  And -- and then we just evolved into, um, [MN] what I did, you know, things that we would do for each other that were work related [MN] you know then we just sort of became friends.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  Just to do it, uh, you got to be friends that way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, see, my friend, I guess, my other friend was actually [LAUGH] a girl I went to school with sister.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that was kind of different.  But her kids are close to my kids' age so ...  And I'm still -- we talk to her sister, or whatever, so I mean I'm still, you know, but we're not best friends or anything like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We talk when you see each other or whatever.  You know what I'm [LAUGH] saying?  But I guess that would probably be my two good friends.
R:  And then I have the miscellaneous friends.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]  Um, [MN] the people that might call -- say that I'm their friend but -- but they're not -- we don't really -- do not [LAUGH] it's -- I -- I consider a friend more than just, you know, you say they're your friend and that's the end of that.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  It goes deeper.  So ...
L:  It's some -- y- you, like, don't know if you could really trust to tell something personal to.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  I mean, I might be on somebody elses list of friends but they're not on mine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  So you got to watch who you're friends [LAUGH] with.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, that was always how -- but I guess in high school I had one close friend.  And, so ...  But I think if you get a [MN] big group of friends and, I mean, [MN] and it seems like to me, it seems like, um, how would you put it?  You don't know which one you can really trust or you ...   You know what I'm saying?  If you get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like four or five good friends.  So one perfect friend, I'd guess you'd say, you know.  The close person you have.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And so ...  But ...  Did you ever have any -- have they always been female friends or have you ever had close male friends?
R:  No, I've had cl- I've had close male friends.  
L:  So, I mean, that, you know.  [MN]
R:  Only, um, they got to be a little bit of a problem for a little period of time.  It got confused.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They thought you liked 'em and all that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually, um, he -- he thought that he liked me and --
L:  And it was just -- and he --
R:  -- and I wasn't on his wa- wave length, thank God, because -- and then a little bit later I thought that I liked him.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, my.  
R:  [LAUGH]  But nothing happened 'cau- -- you know, and then because he had a girlfriend.  I had a boyfriend. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  But it was kind of crazy because, you know, we were still good friends.  We were clo- -- he was my best friend.
L:  Yeah.  So that's what makes it.  Yeah.  But, I know ...  I think as a wife, if my husband had a female friend I would kinda worry.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Yeah, when you're married.
R:  -- you should.  I mean -- I mean, people say no but -- but it does get -- there's -- there -- it gets a little bit confusing in there. 
L:  Yeah.  So, I mean, 'specially, you know ...  And then you see a lot of, um, how would you put it?  Married couples that are friends.  But sometimes it turns too much.  You know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They got to watch their boundaries, I [LAUGH] guess you'd [LAUGH] say.
R:  Right.  That's what I'm saying about the confusing part.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Boundaries.
L:  So ...  Our boy could be getting jealous of the other and there's no -- there's nothing there.  Just a good friend you can talk to or whatever.  
R:  Right.  But I think it should be established, maybe before the marriage that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, you know, um, [MN] if you needed these other people in your life then -- then maybe we shouldn't get married.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something like that.
L:  On that point.  But, oh, I'm trying to think if I really -- I never really, I guess, had any really close male friends, I guess you'd say.  I'm trying to think of -- I guess there was one but it was kind of like we knew we was just friends, you know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  There was nothing there.  
R:  Right.  
L:  And so it was like we was always friends.  [LAUGH]  And so ...  But that makes it easier and so ...  [MN]
R:  Do you have a lot of [MN] other, like, just plain friends?  Are you a friendly person?  You seem -- you sound like you're a friendly person.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You're talking to me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I'm trying to think on that.  [MN]  Some people think I can come across snobby.  'Cause if I'm like meeting a person for the first time I won't really, personally, talk to 'em.
R:  Mhm. 
L:  Do you know what I mean?  Do you -- how are you?  [MN]  Are you outspoken?
R:  Um, yeah, pretty much.  
L:  See I -- I could be outspoken in, like, a group of one or two but when it comes to a big group then it's kind of like, okay.  Or a group of five or something like that.  But I hated speaking in school in speeches and stuff like that.  I hated being out front.
R:  But is that because [MN] you're, um, because you're snobbish or because you're [MN] shy?
L:  I -- I don't think I'm not -- shy.  Yeah.  So I always kinda wonder like if the person that always says if somebody's a snob you're always wondering if they're really shy deep down.
R:  That's -- you know, they can be.  Because my mother was always considered -- not always but -- but a lot of people thought that she might be snobbish 'cause she was reserved.  But she was from the old country.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and she just, you know, was reserved.  She didn't know to be outgoing.  And, um, but she wasn't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, she wasn't that way at all.  
L:  Exactly.  That's what I mean.  Like I sing in our church and stuff, and I hate getting in front of people, but when you sing it's kinda different.  But if you get there and talk that -- I don't know.
R:  Does your voice crack?
L:  No.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Not that.  I would rather sing than talk, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, you know, but they always say a lot of singers are actually shy in that way.  Because, you know, they're like given a lot of -- you always hear on interviews, or whatever.  That's what -- my little boy was watching the interview of Shania Twain and it said that she was always, how did they put it?  She doesn't like being in front of a lot of people and stuff like that.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I forgot how they worded it but when she gets in front of people to do the music, that's not talking [LAUGH] I guess.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  So that's different.  
R:  How -- 
L:  So ...
R:  How many, um -- how many calls have you talked?  And this is my third -- my third call.
L:  Um, second one actually.  And so ...
R:  This is the best one I've had.  
L:  Oh.
R:  The other one we sort of like muddled through the [LAUGH] conversation.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  That's what I had with somebody.  I mean, it was our top- -- our other topic was like families so that one was kind of, like, okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  The other topic was what?
L:  Family.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So ...  I guess I'm with the Fs here.  Family, friends.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know what's going on.
R:  I had holidays with a male, um, from -- from California.
L:  Oh, my.  That would really be ...
R:  And he was younger and I could tell he was, you know, of another race so [MN] I mean he was on
