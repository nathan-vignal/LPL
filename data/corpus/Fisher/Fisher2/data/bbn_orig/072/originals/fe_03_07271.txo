L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  
L:  This is Patty.  I'm in, uh, [inaudible], Minnesota.
R:  Oh, Patty.  I'm Ronnie and I'm in Helena, Montana.  
L:  Isn't this just an amazing conversation?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  It just never ceases to amaze me.  How many calls have you had?
R:  Um, I -- I've had like four but I've only done two.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Yeah, how many have you had?
L:  I haven't gotten a check.  I think I have to call somebody pretty soon here.
R:  Well, that's why I didn't do anymore.  I finally got a check, uh, last week and it's been since February.  
L:  Oh, okay.  So maybe it takes a while.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Because I know it's been -- I didn't do any in June.  And I just -- or I mean I didn't do any in May.  
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, I started --
L:  And I did 'em April.
R:  I started in February and I just got a check last week.  But ...
L:  Well, at least, it comes through.
R:  Yeah.  So I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- prefer eating in a restaurant.
L:  I do too 'cause then I don't have to cook.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I like restaurants and I like steak.  
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  And salad.
L:  Even though we're not supposed to.
R:  Oh.  I like a steak, salad, potatoes and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's my favorite.  
L:  I just had, um, sirloin tips with, um, onions and mushrooms.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And that was really excellent.  It was really juicy.  You know it had a lot of -- it had a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- lot of juice with it, you know.
R:  That sounds good.
L:  [LAUGH]  It was really good.  It was excellent.  Any day I would take going out to eat co- compared to cooking at home.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  I mean, why wouldn't I?  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, [MN] I like doing roast and things like that at home, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But that's not -- I do prefer reservations and a [LAUGH] take out.  
L:  Yeah.  And if somebody's buying, well, all the better you know.
R:  I know.  Why not?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Is there a lot of good restaurants up there?
L:  Um, we got a lot of chains.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.  Um, I guess that's what I would say about that.  Um, and other, you know, we have the typical kind, you know, like the Applebee's and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, let's see what else do we -- we're gonna get an Olive Garden.  I don't know if you have that.
R:  No.
L:  Are you very big?
R:  We don't have --
L:  Are you in a big city?
R:  Yeah.  The capital.  But we don't have an +Olive Garden.  We don't have a Red Lobster.
L:  Really?
R:  No.  No.  We finally got a Golden Corral a few months ago.  
L:  Oh, we don't -- I don't know that kind.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's like a -- it's like a chain where you, uh, [LIPSMACK] everything's buffet style.  
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  But it's, you know, it's one price and everything's buffet style and it's pre- it's pretty good.  They're doing really good.
L:  Do you have an Old Country buffet?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  No.
L:  May -- so maybe that's like mid west kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know, that's kind of amazing.
R:  But we do have an --
L:  Maybe the --
R:  -- Applebee's.  In fact, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ate there about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- two weeks ago and I tried one of their new, uh, some kind of a salad.  A green salad with chicken strips on top.  
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, I was -- yeah, I liked that.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  I liked that.
L:  I, uh, I, um, we have a Grizzlys and I just had a -- a raspberry salad.
R:  [MN]
L:  With raspberry dressing and it was, um, drizzled over and then it had the chicken breasts on there, you know. 
R:  Oh, good, huh?
L:  [LAUGH]  It was to die for, yeah.
R:  How did you read --
L:  Then --
R:  How did you get to sign up for these phone surveys?
L:  Um, well, I'm a merchandiser.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  And, um, anyway I'm on a lot of different websites.
R:  Yeah, that's how I found --
L:  And --
R:  -- out. 
L:  Yeah, and somebody told me.  Do you do a lot of mystery shopping and that kind of thing?
R:  No.  I signed up for mystery shopping and then I decided not to.  The pay wasn't good at all.  
L:  No, it stinks.
R:  Yeah.  And I said, "Oh, I can't be bothered".  I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some of them were only like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eight dollars and by the time I get into town and -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I -- I stopped doing that.  I didn't --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- even start it.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I, um, I -- that was kind of my goal this year.  Was to -- to do more of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I decided that it's not worth, you know, it's not worth doing.  
R:  No.  
L:  You know, and I -- I mean that sounds crazy but it's like, you know, my time is really worth a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  So you would find -- well, do you work?
R:  No.  Not now.  No.  
L:  Okay, 'cause I do merchandising and that's pretty good.
R:  Oh, how --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  What's -- what's that entail?
L:  Well, um, there's a lot of different websites and [NOISE] um, it's [MN] you -- uh, you know, like, um, I put out greeting cards at ...  Do you have Target?
R:  Yep.
L:  I -- I put out greeting cards there in a four foot section every other week.  
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  And you go in there like for, um, you know, sixty minutes and I -- I -- like I would say a job is, um, never that bad because it doesn't last that long.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  I mean, that would be just one of the many things.  Today I was at a Toys R Us and doing an inventory on jewelry that has names on it.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And ordering them.  I do a lot with, um, videos, like, um, through Promido[?] which is a chain like K Mart or Target.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I actually, um, you know, like a company sends me out to, uh, you know, collect ones that are older and send them back to the company.  Like most --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- books.  Like all the books at Target.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And all the videos at Target.  That's all done by a private company.  
R:  Oh, gee, I never knew that.
L:  But see, yeah, you don't -- you don't really know that.  You know, until you get into it.  And then you just kinda say, well, I'll be a son of a gun.  Most of the time it's during the day.  And you see people walking around with papers in their hands.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Or clipboards.  You know.  I do, um, oh, like I just got a display in the mail and I had to go to Best Buy and put it up where the phones were.  Like it was a special display that the phones needed to sit on.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  And I went up and put that up.  
R:  Oh, geez.
L:  You know, just really bizarre things and they pay usually like -- like a little -- little thing like that they'll give you, um, oh, maybe a flat rate of fifteen bucks.
R:  Gee.
L:  To do it well.  I probably -- I work for twenty two different companies.  
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And, um, that's what I do.
R:  Gee.
L:  You know, it's all these different jobs.  You never know when you're gonna have a job.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or if you're gonna have a job.  But I don't care anymore.  I'm beyond caring.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I know.  
L:  I don't need to care anymore.  So, um, it works out really good for me.  And it pays a whole lot of money.
R:  Gee.  That sounds good.
L:  As long as you buy at K Mart, Walmart or Target or any of those big stores, like, Best Buy ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, then -- then you can make pretty good bucks.  And it goes right in there with mystery shopping.  Like all the -- like I go out a lot for -- like I have one mystery shop place that gives me a coupon for forty dollars to go out and eat pizza.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And then they give me ten dollars to fill out the report and -- and whatever tip I leave.  
R:  Huh.
L:  Well, see that's a lot better than ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] You know, eight dollars to go --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- to uh, you know, Hardees.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And I love to eat so it's a really good way to get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- free food.
R:  Free food too.  
L:  Yeah.  You know, but, um, those are the -- the thing I -- the negative is, is that they -- the forms are real -- you know, a lot in there.  Just ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, that's a drag.  
R:  Gee.
L:  You know, when you take somebody out to eat and then you have to, you know, read all that stuff when you come back, so sometimes it's nice just to go out and eat.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So ... [MN]
R:  I wonder -- I wonder how these people base their, uh, surveys?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know.
R:  I mean, where they come up -- the one I did before was on airline security.
L:  Oh, is that right?  I did one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on -- I did one last week on family.  What family --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- means to you.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I -- yeah, I don't know if they -- if they're just listening to you talk or if they [LAUGH] want to see if you've got a speech impediment.  I don't know what they're doing.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Don't -- I don't --
R:  But I did see --
L:  -- care [MN].  It was ten dollars.  Right?  I mean, ten dollars a phone conversation, right?
R:  Right.  Yes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  And, um, I know some people they've -- at first I believed there was a -- there was a [LIPSMACK] a maximum of three we can do.  
L:  Oh. 
R:  That's what -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- they told us at first but I don't know if that's true or not.  
L:  Oh, I think I got three the first week.  
R:  Oh, gee.  
L:  You know, and then I went to Switzerland to visit my daughter so I didn't -- I was really busy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I was -- I travel -- I travel about a hundred mile radius from my home.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  You just -- you know, just during the day.  I just go out during the day.  You know, I don't -- I don't go otherwise.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, it works out pretty good.  It's some- it's something for you to consider.
R:  Yeah.  If I could figure out --
L:  You know.  
R:  Now you found this on a website?
L:  I'll tell you the name of the website to start with.
R:  Okay, hold on.  Let me get a piece of paper.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Hold on.  [MN]  Okay.  
L:  It's called narms like arms.  It's narms.  N.A.R.M.S. dot com.  
R:  Okay.
L:  W.W.W. narms --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- dot com.  And that stands for National Association of Retail Merchandizers.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And you can look in there.  You can sign up.  Um, you can look at jobs available.  
R:  Huh.  And they --
L:  And it --
R:  -- don't charge you for signing up?
L: Uh-uh.  It's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- all free.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And I just had somebody call me today and they offered me fifteen dollars an hour to go put up a display, build a cardboard display at, um, uh, Office Max.
R:  Geez.
L:  And they were calling from California and they saw my -- my name on the narms site.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And it doesn't cost you any money.
R:  Okay.  Soon as --
L:  You know.
R:  -- I get off that's where I'm heading.
L:  [LAUGH]  And, you know, you just never know when they're gonna call.  And if it's not convenient tell them to pull it off.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  You know, I mean, 'cause you're the one in charge of your life.  
R:  Good going.  
L:  You know.
R:  And they pay pretty quick?
L:  I -- and I've been doing it for thirteen years and I had one company try to stiff me and I bugged 'em every month for like three months and they eventually paid.
R:  Oh, good.  
L:  You know, so out of all those companies, and I work for a lot of them, um, they've
