R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Brad.
L:  Oh, hi.  This is Linda.
R:  Hi, Linda,  How are you today?
L:  I'm real good.  How 'bout you?
R:  I'm doing great.
L:  Oh, that's great.  So, which do you prefer, eating out or eating at home?
R:  Well, I -- I would prefer eating out, but I don't eat out very much. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  No, I -- I, um, just graduated from school so I'm kind of on a tight budget right now, so it's a --
L:  Oh, I'll bet.
R:  [NOISE] -- lot of, ah, frozen stuff and stuff out of a box, ah, a little fast food every now and again.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's, like, not very nutritional at all. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's really -- well, you know, I'll have some fruit and stuff too.  I'm not too bad.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, for me I'd -- I probably would prefer eating out over cooking --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  But, you know, my -- my kids are raised now so, you know, we're able kind of to do that more --
R:  Right.
L:  -- than we used to be able to.  [MN] But I still cook at home too, you know, every once in a while, you know, when everybody's going to be here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I do, but ... [LAUGH]  So what school did you graduate from?
R:  I just graduated from the University of Mississippi Law School.
L:  Oh, for goodness sake.
R:  Yeah, I'm studying for the bar exam right now so --
L:  Oh, my gosh.  That's like major, huh?
R:  No, no, it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- keeping me busy.
L:  Oh, I'll bet.  Definitely.
R:  So, ah, yeah, I live by myself so th- -- I don't cook a whole lot. [LAUGH]
L:  I imagine not.
R:  It's not really practical for one person unless I want to have it for three days.
L:  That's true, that's true.  My, ah, youngest son is heading off to college this fall --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- full time.  And so I think he's probably going to find out what that kind of eating is like also. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Is it far away from home where he's going to school?
L:  Um, just a couple of hours away from home.
R:  Okay, but it's far --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- enough away so he won't be just coming home for a meal?
L:  Right --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- exactly. [LAUGH]  No, he won't be able to do that. [LAUGH]  So, what's your favorite meals?
R:  [SIGH] You know, I like just a good steak, ah, and some vegetables --
L:  You know --
R:  -- and then that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah, me too.  Hon- honestly that's probably -- if I was eating out in a restaurant, that's probably my favorite too, is like a good fillet mignon. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  The last time I went -- I actually went out to eat this past weekend and we went to a, ah, Greek place.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Ah, and had a gyro but, ah, don't go there too often actually.
L:  Yeah, how's that?  I've never had one of those.
R:  It's pretty good.  It's like, ah, lamb and I believe it has beef in it and, like, some onions and peppers and, ah, wrapped up in a pita.
L:  Ooh, that sounds good.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It's pretty good.
L:  I've always seen those, but I've never had the courage to get one. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's sort of, ah [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it -- it's kind of a different taste.  Ah, a lot of pe- -- a lot of people don't like it.
L:  Oh really?  Oh my goodness.  Yeah, I don't -- I don't know if I would like that or not.  But it does sound good. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, it's wo- worth [NOISE] giving it a try.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  What, ah -- what type of restaurant do you guys usually go to?
L:  Oh, we go to, like, all kinds, you know?  Just pretty much anything goes, you know?  We do fast food, clear through to, you know, I -- I do, ah, coupons and refunding and stuff like that a lot, so a lot of times I find good deals on better places to eat, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That helps the old budget out, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Sure.
L:  And, ah, probably -- I don't know, probably my second favorite would probably be pizza.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  D- do you like pizza too?
R:  Oh, I love pizza.  I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- actually I usually get, um -- I had a pizza a few days ago and it was from Papa Johns.  I don't know if they have those where you are?
L:  Oh, yeah, that's my favorite. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you could get a large one topping pizza for five ninety eight.
L:  Right.  Exactly.
R:  Great deal.
L:  Exactly.  And their crust is so good 'cause they make it like out of this bread dough.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's like so good. [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's probably my favorite.  So do you like the, ah, garlic butter sauce?
R:  I do. [LAUGH]
L:  Do ya?
R:  I love that, yeah.
L:  Now, see I -- I don't eat that, but my husband does.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He li- -- the -- him and my kids they fight over that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's -- that's what you do with the left over crust.
L:  That's right. [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] it's great. [LAUGH]
L:  That's absolutely right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I usually get one of those and it's dinner and then lunch the next day.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  So you could whack off a large pretty easy then, huh?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That sounds about right for your age. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I think both of my sons can do that too.
R:  [NOISE] I bet.  Where -- where are they going to school?  
L:  Um --
R:  Or you said the one is?
L:  -- my youngest is going to go to, ah, Purdue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm from Indiana --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's -- it's in Lafayette it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a couple of hours away.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You've heard of that?
R:  The boiler makers.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I know Purdue.
L:  Yeah, oh that's wild that you've heard of it.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  Are you a, ah, sport fan on TV?
R:  Yeah, I am.
L:  I wondered. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so that's -- yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, they usually do pretty good. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  Yeah, he wants to be a, um, airplane mechanic.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Purdue have their own airport [MN] --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- so -- yeah.  So it's --
R:  That's unusual.  I --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  They have like -- most people don't know it, but they have their own airport and they have, like, twenty one, um, private jets --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that they own.  That the college owns.
R:  Right.
L:  And so he gets to work right at the airport and, you know, that -- that'll be his college.  He'll be right in the mechanics part working on the engines.
R:  Well, that sounds perfect.
L:  So ...  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he wants to do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, you know [LAUGH] we'll see. [LAUGH]  Ah, but anyways ...
R:  [MN]
L:  But, yeah, so, [SIGH] you know, as far as meals -- like I said, I used to cook a lot when the kids were -- you know, we had a garden and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when they were growing up and stuff, but like you said, when it went back to just cooking for one or two now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that -- that's hard, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's just so much faster and, you know --
L:  It is, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- easier.
L:  [NOISE] Now, I -- what kind of frozen things do you get that are good?  'Cause I've never really been much into the frozen --
R:  Well --
L:  -- dinners.
R:  None of it's very good to be honest with you. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's what I always thought.
R:  Yeah, just -- ah, you know, different things -- I'll see all different things at -- at the store.  Ah, nothing in particular.  Um, or somethings I'll just get a box of like the pasta-roni or something --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and have that.
L:  Now, that's pretty good.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's cheap.
L:  That's pretty good.
R:  Um, and just, ah, different things.  I -- like for lunch I usually have a sandwich.  You know, I'll get some deli --
L:  Sandwich meat and, yeah.
R:  -- meat and some chips, and yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes I'll, ah, I don't know, cook a few things.  I cook jambalaya pretty often and ...
L:  Now what's that?  I don't think I've ever had that.
R:  Jambalaya?  It's like, um -- people make it different ways, but usually it's, ah, rice, um, it has a lot of spices in it and, like, um, you can put different meats.  I'll put sausage and, ah, either chicken or shrimp.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Um, [MN] and, you know, I don't make it from scratch.  You can get a -- a mix --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and just add the meat to it, ah --
L:  Oh, that -- oh --
R:  -- so, yeah, it's pretty good.
L:  -- that sounds -- I'll have to try that sometime.  That sounds pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] I guess that's a popular Louisiana food.
L:  I -- yeah, I wondered. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wondered, 'cause we don't hear of that too much up here --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you know?
R:  -- you have a lot of the jambalaya and gumbo and stuff like that and --
L:  Yeah, see that's not -- in our area that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- th- that's not real heard of. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's -- that's not the big hot item on the menu up here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, I -- I'm originally from Tennessee and I'd never really eaten it that much when I lived there.
L:  Oh, I bet not.
R: Um, until I moved down here, so --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- you know, it was new for me too.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's -- that's different food, definitely.
R:  Well, I lived in Colorado for a while and I ate, ah, buffalo meat [LAUGH] quite a bit when I was out there --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- so that was different.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah, you can just buy it in the stores, like, you know, how you get ground hamburger meat --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you can get ground buffalo meat.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  Now, what does that taste like?
R:  Um, it's a lot leaner than beef.
L:  Really?
R:  Ah, it's just a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I think it has a really good taste, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe a little more of a [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bitter type taste, but it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's really lean.
L:  So actually that would be really good for you then?
R:  Yeah, it is.  It is really good for you.
L:  That kind of meat would be.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, that's really interesting. [LAUGH]  I hadn't thought about that.  I hadn't heard anyone that had eaten buffalo before. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty neat. [LAUGH]  Oh.  [MN] [NOISE]  But, ah, so, ah, y- -- how did you hear about this Fisher project?
R:  Um, I got an email from a friend that I went to school with and she had a friend, ah, who had heard about it.  I think her friend maybe went to the University of Pennsylvania or something.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she had sent an email [NOISE] to her and then, you know, she sent to ten other people and --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- it's kind of got filtered down this way.
L:  Yeah, it's just been kind o- -- kind of a neat way to make fast cash, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Really, I mean, you know?  And the topics so far have just, you know, been real easy to discuss, so ...
R:  Well, I -- I just signed up this morning and so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  I just heard about it.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  How long have -- how long have you been doing this?
L:  Well, this is my third call now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, ah, from -- from the source that I have, I think the maximum is five --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that you can get, you know?
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  An- --
R:  -- that's what I was told.  I don't know [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  And so, you know, but -- but the sources I heard it from, you know, I'm on a -- a refunding board on my internet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what I heard from it, and, ah, they said they pay real good and everything, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  But, yeah, it's real interesting isn't it, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Just talking to folks and --
L:  You just kind of talk and meet people all over the country, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, well f- -- and food is pretty wide [LAUGH] open topic because you can --
L:  Oh, I know it, I know it.
R:  -- can talk forever on that.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  So, are there any other kind of different restaurants down in your area that, like, we wouldn't have here?
R:  Um, [MN] well, there's a couple of popular local places that serve like, I- I guess you'd call it southern food, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Just like a lot of vegetables and fried okra and catfish and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, really good.
L:  But, you know, that's even kind of different than Tennessee though, isn't it?  'Cause my husband and I both went to college in Tennessee.
R:  Where did you go?
L:  And that's -- ah, we went to Milligan College.
R:  Wh- --
L:  It's down in the, like, ah, it's either north east or south east corner of the State.
R:  M- Milligan?  Ah, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've never heard of that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's where we went.  It's a, ah, private liberal art school --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- where we went.  So we were down -- we were just, like, right down in the -- right on the tip of the mountains.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  So -- but, yeah, I -- you know, when you say southern food, you know, there's like different kinds of southern.
R:  Well especially --
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Right, since you were in the moun-
