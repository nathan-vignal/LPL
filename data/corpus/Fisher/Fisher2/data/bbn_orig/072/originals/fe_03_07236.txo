L:  Hi, my name's Wendy.  Hello?
R:  H- hi.  [LAUGH] I'm Rachel.  Sorry.  
L:  Oh, hi, Rachel.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I didn't hear a tone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I -- I barely heard it.  I thought maybe it was maybe my phone.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I didn't hear it at all.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Okay.
R:  I was getting ready for the dishwasher too though, so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I'm down by my, uh, washing machine and [LAUGH] dryer so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  But maybe that's why neither one of us heard it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  It's a possibility. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So I guess the topic is I -- whether you have a lot of friends and acquaintances or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just a few.  Uh, do you have any thoughts?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I said, do you have any thoughts on the topic or ...?
R:  Um, well, I was actually thinking recently that I have too many acquaintances and I wish that some of them were closer.  So I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- trying to concentrate on the close friends and the people who will matter and the people that I want to get to know.  
L:  Right.
R:  Rather than --
L:  That --
R:  -- just people I see occasionally. 
L:  That makes a lot of sense.  Yeah.  I -- I would have to agree.  I have a lot of acquaintances, um, I have two children and so we make a lot of, kind of, friends that you go to the park with or you see --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you see at school and --
R:  Play date.
L:  Play dates.  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  And, uh, I found though with a family that it's really ha- difficult to have very close friends.  Uh, being married, my husband's my best friend.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, just I -- with having two children it's much -- much more difficult to -- to develop a close friendship, at least for me.  Back --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I just had one child I was just -- wanted to have, you know, a -- a great best friend to go do stuff with my son, and now that I've got two of them it just seems like there's just not enough time in the day for everything.  So ...
R:  Right.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  How old are they?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I have a twenty one month old and a eight year old.  
R:  Uh.
L:  So ...  [MN]
R:  See I moved across the country to move in with my best friend at the time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And she and I were very close and now that we live in the same town, um, we barely speak to each other.  And she has a child and she's also married, going through a divorce.
L:  Oh.
R:  And she's -- she's very young.  So that made it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- extremely difficult to maintain a friendship with her.  Um --
L:  Right.  That's what I found too.  I think maybe I don't want to have a lot of close friends, because I know in the past I've had close friends and I felt like I've given so much to the friendship and that all of a sudden, you know, a man comes along and, uh, you're just pushed off to the side.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  I've had a lot of difficulties with friendships like that in the past, or you feel like you're giving everything and they don't care.  Or you can't rely on them.  +Oh.
L:  R- right.  Yeah.  And you get disappointed really easily and -- and then over the years I've found that men make really good friends.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then eventually no matter how they pretend that they just want to be friends, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- sometimes [LAUGH] that, you know, it went -- winds up that they're actually an +ulterior -- ulterior motive involved.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That does tend to happen frequently.  
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I've noticed that as well.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They -- they wait a couple years and then they're like, "Oh, well, I'm really in love with you and --"
L:  Yeah, by the way ... [LAUGH] 
R:  "-- I've been hiding it all this time".  Whoa.  Wait a second.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's like what happened to my best friend.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you lose a best friend and -- and then that whole thing is really [LAUGH] strange.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I d- I don't know what I really prefer.  I would say -- you know, I would -- would love to have one real good best friend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that when, you know, [MN] because my husband's my best friend.  We can talk about everything but, of course, there's times when we get in arguments --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I hate his guts and --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- you know.  [LAUGH]  But I'd love to have a best friend that I could just call and -- and vent all of that stuff.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, uh, of course, you can't do that with acquaintances.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  If you do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that they start to [LAUGH] think you're a bit odd.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  I'm lucky at this point.  Um, I started a new job several months ago and I m- met two really, wonderful great people there.  
L:  Oh.
R:  One of them actually gave me dirty looks [LAUGH] the first couple of weeks but, um --
L:  Oh, [MN].
R:  -- the -- one of them's named Aaron.  It's a man.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I -- I know he's in love with me so it's okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And it's --
L:  So you know ahead of time?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  And the other was someone who used to date him and is very over protective now.  But she --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- she turned out to be wonderful.
L:  She must've been the one giving the dirty looks then?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  She has severe trust issues.  So ...
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]  Do you have a -- a -- have you experienced having a difficult time with, um, having friendships in the work place or ...?
R:  Um, not really.  Um, I -- we work in a call center for --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Semantic which is more an anti virus.  All of that --
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  -- we do -- we do all their customer service.  And, um, there's about three, [MN] well, around three hundred people there and they work on the bottom floor now, and I work on the top. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it -- we don't see each other very often.  We come and say hi on breaks.  We're always shooting emails back and forth.  And I just spent --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all weekend, every weekend, with them and our other small group of friends.
L:  Oh.
R:  Our group of friends is all patched together.  Like one person will bring one person in and another will bring another in and then we just all start hanging [LAUGH] out with ...
L:  Oh, that sounds great.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  And it's really close knit.  It's really good.
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  Very nice.
L:  -- wonderful.  Yeah, I had a bad experience with becoming friends with somebody I worked with.  It was a gal that I worked with for a couple of years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I thought we were good friends.  We commuted together.  You know, we'd go out and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all that kind of stuff.  And I had got in a car accident and I guess she didn't believe I was injured and all of a sudden she -- she didn't call to ask how I was feeling and --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- I never heard from her again.  So, you know, that was kind of disappointing. 
R:  That's sad.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, when I was making the transition between jobs I was at my old job for approximately a year and a half.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I sort of lost all of my friends from there as soon as I stopped working there.  And it was really disappointing because we were -- I was -- felt that I was very close to them.  But apparently I [LAUGH] wasn't.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  I know.  That's where you don't know, you know, where you think that you're, um, close friends and then the way that other person behaves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they act more like you're their acquaintance that they can just kinda toss aside really easily.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It gets to the point in your adult life where it's like you have to check like, hm, [inaudible] --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  What point -- what level --
L:  Or -- or --
R:  -- are we on?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Or just not get too close, you know, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're not disappointed in the long run.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh ...  Yeah, so, um ...
R:  Let's see.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, let's see.  Acquaintances and close friends.  Let's see.  Have you -- have you had [MN] a -- a close friend for a lot of years or do you tend to have, uh, have you had like close friends that last for like a couple a years and then you two kind of --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- drift apart or ...?
R:  It seems to be the trend that it -- they last for a couple years and then it sort of dr- drifts apart o- or I don't feel --
L:  Yeah, life changes and ...
R:  -- that they're ...  Yeah, they seem to change more than I do, like, emotionally and mentally.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, uh, because I'm already to the point where I'm [MN] okay and I'm okay with myself and stable and they just have --
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- these moments where they're [MN] they just can't handle anything and then they disappear --  
L:  Uh.  Yeah.
R:  -- for months and by the time they come back I -- I just don't feel that they're the same person or that they are worthy of my time since they spent all that time away from me.
L:  Right.  But it sounds like you don't let it take it -- or you don't, uh, take it too personally.  Which is good.
R:  Well, [MN] it's -- throughout my life I've had peo- -- bad experiences with people so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tend to take things with a [LAUGH] grain of salt now.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] sort of expect it unless it's from somebody who's in my really, really close inner circle.  And you can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sort of see it coming when people are gonna have a breakdown [LAUGH] usually. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But -- or --
L:  That's true.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they're gonna [MN] you know, change.
L:  Start flaking out on you.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And [MN], yeah.  All that kind of stuff.  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, yeah, that's what I try to do now and I think that's why I kind of -- for me I tend to just kinda like the acquaintances where --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're just not too involved and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, like, just the other day, um, I met a neighbor of mine and she's this ninety three year old lady. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And nice as could be but now she is calling me several times a day.
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- and she brought me over something to eat, and I told her I was a vegetarian but then she told me God's not going to punish me if I eat some of her meat.  
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  
L:  And then she made me feel bad because I wouldn't try what she made.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  [several inaudible words].  Like, um, my husband says, "No more talking to the [LAUGH] neighbors".  
R:  Oh, I --
L:  Now you're gonna have to figure out how to get rid of her.  She's [MN] --
R:  Exactly.  You have to live there.  Oh, goodness.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- I've -- I've avoided [LAUGH] talking to my neighbors as well.  I've been living here for quite a [LAUGH] while, like --
L:  Uh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- over a year now.  A- and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Kind of like with work or with, um, with, uh, where you live it's kinda good --
R:  Mhm
L:  -- sometimes to not let people get --
R:  Right.
L:  -- too much into your personal life. 
R:  Keep that distance.  
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Uh, there are very -- still very few people that I associate with at my work place.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and as long as you don't do anything when [LAUGH] you're --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- around them.
