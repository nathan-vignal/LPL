L:  Hi, my name is Rhoda.
R:  Hi, I'm Keke.
L:  Hi.  So this is a delightful topic to talk about.
R:  Okay.  The last one I had was, um, [LIPSMACK] did I think the minimum wage is fair?  [LAUGH] 
L:  This is much more fun.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So where -- where are you?  Where do you, uh ...?
L:  I actually live in Seamy Valley.
R:  Where's that?
L:  Oh, that's in, um, Southern California.
R:  Oh, well, all the way in Georgia.  
L:  Isn't that amazing?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Also I think it's a maximum of three conversations that we have as part of this process and you're my third.
R:  Oh, well, this is my second.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But they don't pay us until we get all three?
L:  I guess so because I haven't received anything yet so ...
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  I think that might be the deal.
R:  But I only got one call and it was disconnected.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I ain't gotten anymore. 
L:  Well, that doesn't count.
R:  I've been calling in.  Yeah.  
L:  So ...  So, yeah, I've enjoyed this.  And, um, so I have been thinking a lot about friendship lately.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because I'm realizing that, I don't know, I'm kind of like very much a friend with whoever I'm with at the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I go my separate way and I really enjoy, um, being by myself.
R:  Okay.
L:  So I would have to say that my best friend is simply the person that I'm spending the most time with.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And this particular person is a very unlikely, um, friend for me because they're so different from me.  But what we really -- we have several things in common.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But mostly going to theater.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And so h- he's like an escort companion, and we love going to theater and we talk about the theater and we do crossword puzzles and all that.  Um, and it's just funny because he's always asking me who's my new best friend.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Because I spend time around lots of people and often will, you know, find one person that I click with.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's just for that day.  And then I go my separate way and may never talk to that person again.
R:  Okay.  
L:  So he keeps saying if all these people are, you know, my new best friend then what does that make him?
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] And ...  So I don't know.  What about you?
R:  Well, I, myself, am -- I'm a people person, you know, and I get along pretty much with everybody that I'm with or whatever. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I, on the other hand, [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- have a couple of constant friends.  And I can't just label one as my best friend although I have one that -- that I, you know, talk to, like, almost every day or whatever.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I have, like, four people that I would have to name if -- if somebody asked me to name my best friend.  'Cause, you know, some people you can relate to on different levels.  I have, like, three guy friends that I can talk to.  One of them I can talk to about religious beliefs.  The other one I can get a male perspective on relationships.  
L:  Mm.
R:  My girlfriend, I just get positive reinforcement and motivation on just about everyday living.  And then my other boy, we just -- we just click on everything.  We just enjoy getting together and having a good time.  Watching movies.  Playing cards.  Doing whatever.  
L:  Very cool.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Do these people all get along and are friends with each other?
R:  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm pretty blessed with that.  I --I generally get all my friends to, you know, meet up and click.  They -- they are -- have all been affiliated with one another and ... [LIPSMACK]
L:  And they all met through you?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They sure have.
L:  Interesting.
R:  Yeah.  I live --
L:  Now you know what they say about guy friends? 
R:  What do they say?
L:  They say that if they're a straight guy and you're a straight woman they may say they're just being friends but they always want more.
R:  Yeah, well, I've heard that and I disagree.  [LIPSMACK]  One of --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- them, yeah.  He's been trying to hit on me since high school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm just not [inaudible] him.  Mostly because I'm not attracted to him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the other two.  I met them in high school and I guess I was -- I was always labelled as the little sister.
L:  Oh.
R:  I didn't like get cute.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's in like my first year at college or whatever.  So we bonded as like brother and sister back then and we've just been brother and sister ever since.  Nobody's ever crossed the line.  You know, whenever they had hard times or whatever they'll come stay with me.  They stay in their room.  I stay in my room.  We've never crossed the line.
L:  Hm.
R:  They've introduced me to boyfriends.  I've introduced them to girlfriends.  So I think that men and women can just be friends.  
L:  Uh, now do your boyfriends feel at all jealous or understand?
R:  Um, actually some of them do have a problem with that, I think.  But that comes in with, uh, with, uh -- like if I meet a guy at a club or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we talk for maybe a couple a weeks and then we just jump into a relationship --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, yeah, they're a little suspicious, or whatever.  But I generally like to take my time before I get into a relationship.  So I try to be friends with you for a month.  I try to know everything there is to [LAUGH] know about you before I commit.  And those kinds, you know, they have a chance to get to know my brothers and -- and observe me in different ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  And they can see, you know, that the context of our conversation, how we relate to [MN] one another.  How we, you know, just in general, and then they don't have a problem with it.
L:  Well, that's another thing?  How do you even make the time for a romantic thing when you have all these friends that you enjoy spending time with also?
R:  Well, if I have a boyfriend, which I haven't had a steady in a while 'cause everybody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just wants to jump into something.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know, I'll -- once we get to that point where it's just gonna be me and him then, you know, I kind of cut out all my extra curricular activities.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But until then [MN] I just --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- go with the flow.  And it's not that I, you know, party everyday and then I spend time with my boys, you know, six days a week.  I only see them on occasions because they have girlfriends.  They have jobs.  I sub during the school year so I'm not at home during the day and I got a five year old and I try to keep the extra curricular activities --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so ...  Yeah, so ...  We just kind of get up whenever it's convenient.
L:  You know, um, are you the kind of person that loves to celebrate everybody's birthday and give gifts out of just friendship and just 'cause?
R:  Yeah.  I do things just 'cause.  [MN]  Like my girlfriend, or whatever, um, a couple of months back she was, you know, having a little financial difficulty.  And I came into some money with my, um, a little bit more money than I thought I was gonna get with my, um, [LIPSMACK] um, uh, tax refund.
L:  Cool.  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, I broke her off like two hundred dollars.
L:  Oh.
R:  Just to say, you know, I love you and thank you, girl.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That is really beautiful.  
R:  But she does that with me too.  If she's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- blessed, you know, with some extra money or whatever, she'll help me out too.  So, that's cool.  And then my brothers.
L:  And you've really kept these friendships for a long time.
R:  Yeah.  I've had 'em for a long time.  My girlfriend I -- I met her, um, and it's really funny because the females that are in my life, when I first meet them I can't stand them.  For some reason or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- another.  Oh, I can't stand these girls.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'd rather slap 'em than look at 'em.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But after, you know, I chill out with them, or whatever, like my best friend, the one I'm telling you about now, I didn't like her at first.  I thought she just thought she was just the, 'scuse my expression --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a shit.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  But now I just love her to death.  I wouldn't trade -- trade her in for anything.  And I met her --
L:  So how did you get past the first feeling?  I mean, why would you even spend time chilling out?
R:  Well, because she was close friends with two of my best friends.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In college.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I didn't have any choice but to put up with her.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But then we ended up getting pregnant at the same time.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So that brought us a little bit closer together.  You know, we had something in common.
L:  And are your kids each close with each other as well?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- call each other cousins and --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- they ask for each other, you know, if they haven't seen each other in a couple a days.  They're like, "I want to go see Daphne" or --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "I want to go see Joseph" and "When are we gonna get to play together?" and stuff like that.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So they fight like brother and sister.  They're really close.  
L:  And speaking of brothers and sisters.  Do you have brothers and sisters?
R:  No.  That's probably why I have so many friendships, because I'm the only child.  And I spent a lot of time alone when I was younger.  So I just --
L:  You know, I'm an only child.
R:  -- I love making friends now.  
L:  So ...  Hm.  But I'm an only child and for some reason I just feel, you know, I just -- well, for instance, I really admire how my, um, 'specially my older son, who's thirty five --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- has -- he lives in San Francisco, so he lives a little ways away from me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I've seen how he developed a real close network.  He's made -- you know, lots of people do, I guess, when they're older and their families aren't close by is they build a family --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of friends around them.  And I really admire that.  And yet I've never done that, I don't think.  I mean, I feel --
R:  But did you have a lot of cousins and stuff you grew up with?
L:  No.  No, not at all.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And my parents are both gone.  And I feel priv- -- I feel, I don't know, I think I feel like a citizen of the world and that everybody are my brothers and sisters.  And I really feel comfortable, and not needing to just have those unique separate friends which is why this topic is so interesting to me.
R:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  
L:  Hm.  
R:  Well, I am exact
