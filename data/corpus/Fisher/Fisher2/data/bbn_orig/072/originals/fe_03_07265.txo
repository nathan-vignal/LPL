L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Brad.
L:  Hi, this is Kristin.
R:  Hi, Kristin. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] So where are you at?
R:  I am in Mississippi.
L:  Okay, I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think we're supposed to talk about food today. [LAUGH]
L:  Yup.  Do you like to eat at home or eat at restaurants better?
R:  Oh, oh both.  Um, you know, I like to eat out.  Um, [LIPSMACK] like to [LIPSMACK] --probably when I got out I -- I'd say I prefer American food the most, ah, you know, a good steak.  [PAUSE] What about you?  What's your favorite type of restaurant to go to?
L:  Um, I guess my favorite would be anything Mexican food.  And then Italian falls real close behind.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I'm not a big r- -- big red meat eater, so I pretty much like chicken and I like ground beef --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- beans.  And I guess I'd rather eat out all the time, but it's too unhealthy, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And too expensive.
R:  Do you eat out often, or ...?
L:  Not really.  I -- I'm in college right now so I don't have a whole lot of money. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kind of broke.
R:  Yeah, well I just graduated so I don't [NOISE] have a whole lot of money either. [LAUGH]
L:  Yup.  I mean, I'll go out if -- probably -- usually go out somewhere cheap if I do, so ...
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, I -- I eat a lot of fast food. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yup, me too.  A lot of tacos.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, what's your ideal meal?
R:  Oh, ideal meal.  [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] I don't know, I don't really have an ideal meal.  What about you? [MN]
L:  Well, [MN] yours would be like steak or something probably?
R:  Yeah, probably, you know.  [PAUSE] I'm more, you know, I'm -- I'm from the south so I like more, sort of like home cooking type stuff.  Vegetables and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  Mm.  I don't know what mine would be either. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's kind of a weird question.
L:  I don't know.  [several inaudible words] like I said, anything Mexican pretty much.  Like burritos or salads.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah that's kind -- do you like going to like the chain restaurants better, the local places, or ...?
L:  Um, in my home town like, I don't know, my favorite Mexican restaurant there's only one and it's in my home town, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're, like, um, you -- you probably know it, TGI Fridays?
R:  It's what?
L:  TGI Fridays?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I like going there too.  It's a chain.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And Applebee's.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, similar.  Other ones I could take 'em or leave 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What about you?
R:  Um, [SIGH] I'd -- I'd prefer to go to a local place if I can.  Um, but, you know, I mean some of the chain restaurants are good too.  They tend to be a little cheaper I think usually [LAUGH] than the locally owned places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, you know, I'm kind of in a small town right now, so, yeah, there's not a lot.  Um, we have a Applebee's and Chili's and I guess a couple of places.  Um --
L:  We don't even have that in my town, so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I closer to a bigger town, so --
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, yeah we do too.  Um, and is there a variety of restaurants there?  I know you said it's kind of small, but ...?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of Chinese and a lot of Mexican restaurants and we have a Mediterranean restaurant, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, some weird stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Usually don't go to the really weird ones [inaudible] [LAUGH] I just stick with what I like.
R:  When was the last time you ate out?
L:  Um, about two weeks ago.  My, um, boyfriend's parents took him out for his birthday and I got to go with --
R:  Oh, really?  Where did you go?
L:  -- them.  Um, a local Mexican restaurant in their town.
R:  Oh, Mexican huh?  Your favorite.
L:  Yep. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  It's good.  I haven't been out since then [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, I think the last place we went to was -- it was a Greek place.  We had, ah, gyros.
L:  Okay.  Is that like a sit down restaurant or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or like a fast food one?
R:  Yeah it was a -- a [LIPSMACK] -- um, it wasn't a [several inaudible words] chain.  It was just a local place, ah, had eros and, ah, a pita with, ah, mozzarella for an appetizer, and, ah --  Can't remember what else I had there.  It was pretty good.  First time I'd been there.
L:  Mm.  Can't say I've ever eaten at a Greek place, so --
R:  Yeah, um, it's okay.  You know, it's -- it's something different.
L:  Yeah.  What else do they have at those besides like eros?  
R:  Um --
L:  Do they have like lamb --
R:  Gosh, I don't -- 
L:  -- dishes?
R:  -- I don't eat there that much, but it's a lot of that.  It's a lot of the same type stuff just put together differently, you know what I'm saying? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, kind of like other --
R:  But you'll still like Mexican. [LAUGH]
L:  Kind of like Mexican food and Italian.  It's pasta and a sauce. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  There's like four ingredients just mixed up differently. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  So, do you have a job now that you just graduated?
R:  Ah, no.  I -- I just graduated from law school.  I'm studying for the bar exam.  Um, I have a job but it doesn't start until September.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.  So you're just studying during the summer?
R:  Yeah, just studying.  And we have the bar at the end of July.  Um --
L:  So then you've got at least a month to relax?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I'm -- I'm -- and also a month with no pay check.  So, that's not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's not good.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Hmm. 
R:  Well, what -- ah, what [several inaudible words] I guess.  What are you having for dinner tonight?
L:  Um, turkey and dumplings I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, right, turkey.  I --
L:  I'm at -- I'm already at my parents place for the summer right now.  I have one year left of school, so -- my mom made a big turkey 'cause she realized we had five turkeys in our freezer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that they'd accumulated from my brother and got 'em free at work, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- decided to actually make one, so --
R:  See that's one of the things I always look forward to going home, is, ah, home cooked meals.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I'd never make a turkey on my own, so --
R:  No, me either. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I can't even stand to look at the things with all the parts on 'em and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm by myself right now, so, ah, I don't cook very much. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah you wouldn't want a whole turkey.
R:  No, definitely not.  Did have a turkey sandwich for lunch though.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]  [inaudible] turkey. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  So what are you having for dinner tonight then?
R:  Um, you know, I don't know.  It'll probably be something either in a box or --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- frozen. [LAUGH]
L:  Is that usually what your eating right now or ...?
R:  Yeah, some or I'll -- you know, I'll get a pizza or like I said some pasta to eat or something.  It's, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- nothing too extravagant.
L:  Huh.  I see.  Hmm.  I don't know, are you the [inaudible] student, or ...?
R:  Mm.
L:  Mm.
R:  Food, you'd think that would be just a huge topic, huh?
L:  Do you eat a lot of desserts or are you into sweet food?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I do like sweets.  I love sweets.  I think it -- it runs in my family, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]  What's your favorite kinds?  Ah, cheesecake or chocolate or ...?
R:  Oh, ah, both.  No. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I'd say probably cheesecake's my favorite dessert.
L:  Mm.
R:  Ah, but I like all kinds of pies and cakes and ice cream and --
L:  [LAUGH] You like it all.
R:  Oh, I love it, yeah.
L:  I love, ah --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- either angel fruit cake or fresh strawberries.
R:  Oh yeah, that's good.
L:  That'd be my favorite.  And then anything chocolate I think comes after that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I say I love it, but I don't really eat it that often anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  No, me either.  When I get the chance, or not even when I get the chance, when I splurge and whatever.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, when I'm in a restaurant I usually -- I like to get dessert, um --
L:  No.
R:  -- if I'm just eating at home I usually don't have anything.
L:  [LAUGH] Same here.  Especially chocolate, candy or something laying around, or --
R:  Right.
L:  Cookies.
R:  Well, if I have it here I eat it, but if I just don't buy then, you know, I don't really think about it.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But if I eat it, yeah, it's -- it's all gone in a few days.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, geez.  Huh? [COUGH]  Um, mm, what -- what's your favorite kind of snack?  Like a late night or something, do you eat chips or ...?
R:  No, I don't really eat -- eat chips as a snack.  You know, I'll have 'em -- I had some with my sandwich today, but, ah, if -- if I wanted there would be, you know, something sweet like we were talking about.  Cakes or pies or stuff, or, ah, I'll eat a lot of fruit too.  Um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I got a banana last night, or I'll have an apple or something like that.
L:  Mm.  But [inaudible] --
R:  I don't really eat many snacks though to be honest. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me either.  I'll eat fruit and occasionally like popcorn or pretzels or a few crackers here and there.  [several inaudible words]
R:  Right.  Yeah, I need to lay off the sweets.  Just being in school and not, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- being too active, I've put on a few pounds lately. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that'll happen.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know -- you know you don't have time to cook any decent meals either.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  If you eat school food, which I haven't done, but I know when I did --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Argh.
R:  Yeah, and usually all the, ah -- the like, you know -- the processed food that you buy or fast food and stuff are always real fatty and unhealthy.
L:  Yeah, but they're so much easier. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I know.  It's too much trouble to cook just for myself.
L:  Yeah, I know how that goes.  Mm.  Do you have like a George Foreman grill or anything?
R:  I do have a George Foreman, yeah.  I haven't used it lately.  I was on kick for a while and I used it all the time, you know?  Um, but then I haven't used it, you know, in a -- in a while actually.
L:  Boneless skinless chicken breasts are nice on there cooked for eight minutes.
R:  Yeah, that's about the only thing -- well, I'll either cook that or sometimes I would put like a hamburger patty on there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um -- 
L:  I do the same thing.
R:  -- I guess that's pretty much all I used it for there.
L:  Yeah they are nice.  It's not going to make a huge mess and you don't have to wait forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  And then I, ah -- I got a vegetable steamer.  I had the idea I was going to eat, you know, healthy steamed vegetables, and --
L:  [LAUGH]
