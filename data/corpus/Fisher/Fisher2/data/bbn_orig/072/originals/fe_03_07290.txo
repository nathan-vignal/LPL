R:  Hello.  This is --
L:  +Hello.
R:  This is Gilbert Fontaine.
L:  Oh, hi, Gilbert.  My name is Karen.  I'm in Florida.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  
L:  Good.  Good.  Uh --
R:  I live in New Jersey.  My brother lives in Florida.  I understand we're to talk about food.  Whether we like restaurant food or home food.
L:  That -- um, that's also what I understood and then I guess it should, um, [LIPSMACK] -- to elaborate by describing your perfect meal or your ideal meal.  Um, if -- if --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- if -- if there is such a thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] 
L:  Um, but [MN] what -- what -- what would your first, um, instinct be as far as the home cooking versus the eating out?
R:  I prefer home cooking.
L:  Okay.  I -- I have to agree with you.  I, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I definitely do as well.  I don't think anything can beat a -- a -- a nice good home cooked comfort food meal.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, [MN] I'm a bachelor and I -- uh, in ninety two -- well, in ninety eighty my mother got very ill from two strokes.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And with that I had to learn to cook for myself.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And for her for a while.  And, uh, on Sunday we had a mission conference at church --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I baked a small five pound ham --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for it.  And it turned out quite well.
L:  Oh, wonderful.  
R:  I put --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little ground cinnamon on it.  
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, uh, I -- I put some -- I didn't have pineapple jelly --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I used orange marmalade on it. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But, you know, it went over well.
L:  Oh, very good.  Very good.
R:  So, I'm not a good cook.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, at least --
L:  Will you stop selling yourself --
R:  -- I will not --
L:  -- short.  You sound like you're a wonderful cook.  [LAUGH]  Based on your description so far.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, at this point I will not starve.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Very good.  Very good.  Well, I, um, I too, um, I actually, I'm, uh, married and I have a little boy who is eight.  So there's the three of us and we, um -- I do most of the cooking.  I, um, I work full time but I do, um, you know, cook.  And I'm actually, I'm fortunate enough that my job -- I have a home office and then I do a bit of travelling, but for the most part I'm at home so I, um, usually can kind of, as -- after the five o'clock whistle rings I can kind of go in and start to prepare and, um, sometimes it gets a little old hat where I -- I enjoy a break every now and again.  But I really, um, enjoy that.  I think it, kind of, is my wind down time is to cook and, uh, makes me feel good.  It's nice, I think, and important to me, um, to have, uh, sit at the table with the family and have a time to be able to kind of hear about one another's days and to bond that way.  So, um, [LIPSMACK] that was a ritual and kind of a tradition we always had in my family, even though we had a small family.  But we always did that, and so I like to continue that with my own family.  [MN]
R:  Well, there were -- there were my parents, my brother and I for --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- many years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And after my grandfather died and my aunt, my grandmother went to live with, she moved in with us and was there for about eleven years.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And [SIGH] my father was a meat and potatoes man.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  A lot of men are, aren't they?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, they are.  I -- I learned to eat a lot of things.  Like scrapple, sausage, uh, which are -- well, sausage is traditional throughout most of the United States but sausage is a Pennsylvania Dutch, uh, meat.  
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, if you've heard of mush?
L:  Yes.
R:  It'd be something on that order.  There's part of the pig and maybe sometimes there's a little bit of beef in it.  And there's a lot of flour.  It doesn't do good for your cholesterol level though.
L:  [LAUGH]  It's not a health food, is what you're telling me.
R:  N- -- that's right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it's delicious once or twice a year.
L:  Oh, really?  So you have to indulge every now and again.  And now this is -- is it scrapple?  Is that right?
R:  That's scrapple.  Yes.
L:  I have heard of it but I never knew exactly what it entailed, so that's interesting to hear a description from someone who knows it first hand so ...  [MN]
R:  Where abouts in Florida d- do you live?
L:  I live in the panhandle of Florida.  Um, I'm in Pensacola.  Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  So are you -- I don't know if you're familiar with that area at all?
R:  Uh, no.  I'm familiar with Sarasota.  
L:  Okay.  Okay.  [inaudible] that --
R:  Along the west coast.  
L:  The southern west coast of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or at least more southern from me.  I'm -- I'm, uh, probably a good, you know, eight to nine hours or more from there but if -- people forget, um, [LIPSMACK] to -- I mean --
R:  You're in a different --
L:  -- exactly how -- how far -- how big Florida is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  Sometimes people will ask me -- they've called me before to go and do a job or something and they've asked me to go, "Can you get to Fort Lauderdale?" and I say, "Well, I'd love to if -- as long as you're paying for my travel and everything.  It would make a wonderful trip".  You [LAUGH] +know.
R:  Well, just --
L:  But --
R:  -- from Orlando to Sarasota is two hours.  
L:  Oh, right.  Absolutely.
R:  And an hour from Tampa.
L:  Absolutely.  So, yeah, it -- it definitely is very spread out and then I'm up in this nexus, you know.
R:  Yes, I know where P- Pensacola is.
L:  I was gonna say so it- it's -- kind of curves either further over there and, uh, so we're kind of away from all of that down there, but I did used to live in Orlando.  So I -- I have had some experience, and for a short time I lived in Miami.  But it's a nice place --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- down there but --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- I don't get to go.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you have any special foods in that part of Florida?
L:  Any special foods?  We, um, [LIPSMACK] you know a lot of -- I was going to say one thing I -- well, I guess two.  You know, just [inaudible] -- it's kind of combination traditional, you have a lot of southern cooking and then also, um -- so you've got that influence in [inaudible] people, you know, you -- you got your grits and the fried chicken and all that kind of stuff that people associate.  But then also we have some influence, being three hours from New Orleans, where there's a lot of people who, you know, come over for, uh, travels and so we've got the cajun and creole influence --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to some degree.  But, um, so I think we kind of -- w- we're not necessarily really known for anything in particular.  Maybe -- the seafood is very fresh and good here.  Um, but you know, th- there's probably a few things we have some -- [MN] that I know there's a few drinks and things that are known for this [LAUGH] area.  But, um -- but, yeah, it's um, [LIPSMACK] there's not one particular thing I could think of that really pops out in my mind.  Uh, Pensacola, per se, but [MN] um, [LIPSMACK] my favorite cuisine, actually, is hard to get.  I really enjoy eating, if I eat out, I like to eat Indian or Thai food.  And we don't have those type of restaurants here so I have to enjoy --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that when I go [LAUGH] elsewhere.
R:  I'm only a -- [MN] about --
L:  Have you ever had that?
R:  No.  I'm only about three quarters of an hour aw- -- half hour to three quarters of an hour away from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Uh, I'm in, uh, Camden, Philadelphia area.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I grew up in suburban Philadelphia.  And, um, a lot of Italian food, both in that part of Pennsylvania and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- here in New Jersey.
L:  Oh, very good.  
R:  Yes.  A lot of Italian food.  And, uh, some of it I like very much.
L:  Right.  
R:  Uh, when I go out to eat in a restaurant.  
L:  Very good. Uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what do you like to cook?  Wh- uh, what's your favorite thing to prepare since you've begun cooking?  Do you have a specialty dish that's -- you're known for or do you have something that you just really enjoy?
R:  I just throw together.
L:  [LAUGH]  Do you?
R:  Uh, wh- -- uh, uh -- [LIPSMACK] I have a cholesterol problem.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I have a salt problem.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, I now have a pacemaker.  I've had h- heart attack repair work.  You know.
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  So, [MN] I'm seventy four.  
L:  Oh, wow.  I'm so sorry --
R:  And, but, uh --
L:  -- to hear that.  
R:  Well, I'm glad I'm still alive.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's the way to look at it.  
R:  So I get frozen vegetables.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I have a garden with, uh, with tomatoes.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  And I have ten pepper plants in already.
L:  Wonderful.
R:  And I cut the peppers up into little pieces.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not diced but just little pieces.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then I freeze 'em on a plate and then I put 'em in ziplock bags.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, and then I pull out a handful of the -- I like to have 'em either red or yellow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, towards the end of the season I -- I take 'em in when they're green.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they have more vitamins when they're ripe.
L:  Right.
R:  And I throw 'em in with -- if I have cauliflower or broccoli, lima beans, peas, uh, corn.  I throw a little bit in that and --because if you buy the stuff with the pepper already in the frozen food you're paying an extra fifty cents.
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  And I kn- -- don't know how fresh that is.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that's very true.  Well, that's a good i- -- economical way of -- of, um, enjoying that for, you know, and -- and, uh, and taking advantage of working the earth there and -- and, uh, utilizing the resources, so that's wonderful.  Absolutely.  I do a bit of gardening myself.  We have, um, [LIPSMACK] uh -- I actually have some strawberries and some tomatoes going right now.  We had some lettuces earlier but those -- it's gotten to warm down here to keep those going.  And, um, we do some +herb gardening as well which is nice, uh, to cook --
R:  What kind of herbs do you have?
L:  I have, uh, several types of rosemary, just some -- uh, different -- a few different types of basil.  Some thyme.  Some lavender.  Um, gosh what else?  There's some sage, oregano.  Um, you know, just [MN] --
R:  Do you have rosemary?
L:  I do.  I do have so- -- I love rosemary.  And it grows really well down here.  You know.  I know it probably it grows well everywhere.  I think it's fairly easy to grow.
R:  Well, it -- it will winter kill here.
L:  Oh, it will?  It'll freeze?
R:  Yes.  Yes, it freezes.
L:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, we're --
R:  Some -- some --
L:  -- fortunate, I think, with the milder temperatures it seems to stay here.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, we lose rosemary every once in a while.  Some -- one of my neighbors has one that has been there about four years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he wanted to take it out.  I'm in a
