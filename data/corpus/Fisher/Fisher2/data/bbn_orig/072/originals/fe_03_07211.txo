L:  Hi.
R:  [MN]  Hi, my name is Sandy.  I'm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, hi, Sandy.  I'm Brenda Lindquist and I'm in Lafayette, Indiana. 
R:  Okay.  
L:  Yeah.  So we're supposed to talk about friends and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if we have a lot and what --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- kind of person, that kind of thing.  What -- would you like to go first?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Sure.  Um, no, I -- I have a lot of acquaintances but only like a few close friends.  I'm -- I'm mostly a private person.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I, you know, like my -- my best friend is, like, totally the opposite.  She's friends with the entire world.
L:  Oh.  
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Whi- which is weird but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, [MN] you know, we just, you know, we -- we just clicked from the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the moment we met about ten or fifteen years ago at church.  Um ...
L:  That's a good place, though, to meet, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You form good friendships.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah.
R:  And what about you?
L:  Well, I was trying to decide which I am.
R:  [MN]
L:  Actually I -- when you get right down to it I'm a very private person but people say I never meet a stranger.  You know, I -- I like everyone I meet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  At least until they give me reason not to.  And I'm outgoing and I have a lot of acquaintances.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But as far as anyone that I can really feel totally comfortable with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and feel good and, you know, if they call and -- and stuff, you know, maybe feel excited about it, or whatever, um, that's down to, you know, a chosen few.  But I do have like lifelong friends.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I have some from, well, let's see.  Over fifty years.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  So, um, in other words I was a little [LAUGH] child.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, and they've -- they've been, you know, we've just, no matter where they go -- and we can just kinda pick up where we left off.  
R:  Oh, I have two friends from high school that I still, you know, like send Christmas cards to and do over the internet.  And one actually moved here for a few months and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we saw a lot of each other but, um, you know, [MN] one of my cl- -- friends from high school lives in California and the other in upstate New York, near Canada, so it's --
L:  Wow.
R:  You know, we're not really near each other geographically but we still keep in touch.  
L:  That's [MN] great though.
R:  Uh, the likes of the, you know, the -- the one close friend I have we -- we met at church and we just sort of clicked and, you know, we were both very, very active in -- in one committee and we, you know, we'd get together every, um, you know, like when our committee met that -- that night of the month we'd go out to dinner together and --
L:  Oh.
R:  And we really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- had a -- a -- a great time and it's l- like really, really funny because we're just from totally, totally different backgrounds which, you know, once I got to knew her -- know her I was really, really surprised because she's -- she's very down to earth but she's like a blue blood and [LAUGH] she, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Whatever.  But it -- it's like I was really, really totally surprised to -- to find out about her background.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, after I met her because she just -- di- didn't, you know, if -- if you had told me about her background I probably would've shied away from her thinking that she'd be snooty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or something like that and -- and she isn't.  She's very loving and giving and -- and whatever and, you know, she's the person, uh, that I -- I just feel the most comfortable with.  I've, you know, shared a lot of personal stuff with her and, you know, she -- she shared personal stuff with me and, you know, th- things that really surprised me and -- [MN] about her but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's just w- we just seem to click.  We ha- we feel a -- the same way of -- about a lot of things.  We're sort of like, I don't -- I don't want to say outcasts at our church, but we sort of feel differently about a lot of things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about the church politics than most people and -- but -- but we just click.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's -- isn't that amazing how you can be so different yet so much alike?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I had a really good friend that we started out that way and probably a good ten years.  You know, we were just so close and then all of a sudden, you know, there was just this -- this kind of gap and she just kind of would pull away and -- and, um, just didn't seem to need our friendship anymore.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I found that kind -- you know, kind of interesting and, yeah.  I, you know, a sense of loss.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and it's just -- it's -- it's a shame because she was my best friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for, you know, like ten years.  And it wasn't anything where there was any kind of falling out or -- or hard feelings or anything at all.  It's just that, um, you know, she moved to -- closer to her family and she just -- she started a -- a business and then she was just so busy between her regular job and her business and her family that she just didn't really have time for anyone else.  You know.  But friends are -- are amazing.  I have found recently, um, why, I don't know, but very young people have just kind of attached [LAUGH] themselves to me --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, you know, calling me to go here and do this and saying I'm more fun than, you know, their own mom or this or that.  So I think I'm kind of a mom figure that can be a friend.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I had, uh, this one woman who's now passed away, but she was old enough to be my grandmother but, you know, she lived down the block and -- and I just never considered her like an old lady.  I just [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, we -- we, again, we had a lot in common even though we were very, very much different.  Our backgrounds and stuff.  But we had a lot of the same hobbies and stuff like that.  So it's just really funny that if you are open to different people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the types of people that you make friends with a- are usually the type, you know, a lot of them are people that you wouldn't think in a million years you'd have anything in common with.
L:  Well, maybe you hit the nail on the head though when you said open.  You know, where [inaudible] sounds [inaudible] maybe, you know, I know I'm open and it sounds like you are too to just, uh, new experiences, new people and -- and no prejudgments.  Um, you know, and -- and that -- that can open up the whole world to you in just different ways other than, you know, friends as well as other ways, you know, if you just have an open mind and -- and don't try to prejudge something, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Kind of learn from your own experience about the situation.  
R:  I mean, I -- I'd have to agree.  I mean, for -- for me it -- it was hard because I -- I'm from the, uh, New York metropolitan area --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it's like really, really -- it -- it was difficult moving to, you know, a -- a -- a farm family oriented community and, you know, i- it's just like total --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- opposite of -- of what I was used to but [MN] a- and most of the people that I've become good friends with here in Lancaster are Lancaster natives --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who are, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- very, very different from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- me.  But at the same time they, you know, they're just people that I just -- I just clicked with, you know.
L:  Well, that is -- that is great.  I grew up in a suburb of Chicago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I was born in Southern, uh, well, basically Southern Illinois.  Um, ho- -- closest hospital was across the Wabash River -- River which made it Indiana.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But anyway, um, so I -- I had a taste of both worlds.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think that really that -- that was good because I can really appreciate, you know, a rural setting and rural, um, [inaudible] the peace and solitude and the beauty, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that comes with so many things.  And especially, you know, appreciate simple things in life.  But, yet, I can appreciate the things that, you know, is exposed to having gone to a larger high school.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, you know, just the [MN] lifestyle was different so ...
R:  Right.  
L:  Um, I don't know.  Maybe a lot of it [MN] you know, maybe it had something to do with the religion too.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that our -- our, uh, hearts and minds are open to what is out there for us.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, that God's given us.  Whether it's in the beauty of the earth or -- or the specialness of -- of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it just -- I -- I consider myself very lucky though. 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think, uh, I mean, my mother was a very, very open person and just like friends with everybody and -- and stuff like that.  I'm just very much more shy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I [MN] you know, I can get up and speak to a crowd, and whatever, I've, you know, done the Dale Carnegie thing so I've -- I've learned to --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- speak in public and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whatever but that -- and -- and to feel comfortable with it but just on a personal level I, you know, I'm, like I said, I'm very, sort of, very closed and private whereas my mother was like really, really open and -- but she had a zillion --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- friends and, you know, I guess that I -- I just only have a few but th- that's okay because the ones --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that I have are -- are -- are good friends that I can really, really count on.  
L:  Exactly.  And maybe your mom was that way without you realizing.  Maybe she felt --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- inwardly just very special only about a couple.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But yet just had -- like I have acquaintances and friends.  And my --
R:  Right.
L:  -- friends are those that are just, you know, really close.  
R:  Yeah, my -- my -- I mean, my mother was a very, very social person.  Now it was hard, um, you know, for me to really know because she died when I was like twenty five.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  So, you know, that was like a long time [LAUGH] ago.  
L:  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  Uh, so I really, you know, I really never had an adult relationship with her.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's -- it's hard to know, you know, to view her on that plane.  But, you know, I mean, she was very, very social that -- my parents were always doing things that she was always arranging and stuff like that and, again, I'm more private.  We -- we do things with a -- a small group of friends that we, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we -- we see, you know, this couple or we see that couple but we- we- we're not like going out every weekend.
L:  You know, what --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about friends in a workplace?  You know.  Have you found that you try to shy away from close friendships there or you try to, um, make friends?  You know.
R:  Um, I -- I try and make friends but it -- in some respects it's hard because I'm a supervisor so you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- can't be, you know, with the people that I'm surrounded by you can't be too friendly with them.
L:  Yeah, unfortunately.  You know, that's true.  Yeah, I have found that, you know, I -- I'm not in that in position, um, I'm self employed so yet
