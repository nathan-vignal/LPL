R:  Hi, I'm Tracy.
L:  Hi.  This is Robyn.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi.  
R:  So we just, um, start talking about food, I guess.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess so.  
R:  Um, I like eating at restaurants.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I do too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't like to --
L:  Especially when you don't have to --
R:  -- clean up.  
L:  Right.  No clean up.  Just sit there and just ...  Yeah, I like -- I like restaurants too.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what's your favorite meal, I guess?  They want to know.  
L:  Oh, well, a -- a steak.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Some kind, or if -- if we go to Olive Garden we always get the -- I always get the Tour of Italy.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Are you there?
R:  I'm sorry, get the what?  Yeah.  I had to switch cordless phones.  I could hardly hear on that one.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, we usually -- I usually get like -- go to the Olive Garden and I get like the Tour of Italy instead of the steak though.
R:  Oh.  That sounds good.  I'm hungry.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, it -- and we always have -- I always have to choose the lasagna from Manicotti.  
R:  Mm.  We're seafood people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We just --
L:  Oh, I love lobster.  
R:  Do you guys, um, ever go to Red Lo- Lobster?
L:  My husband --
R:  Or do you have one?
L:  -- is not too much into lobster.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Or crab or stuff like that.  Uh, so ...  We've been there once.  Twice.  That's --
R:  It's --
L:  -- about it.  
R:  Yeah, it's pretty good.  We go for the crab. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I love -- we, um, we live in Cal- uh, northern California.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, we go, uh, camping at the ocean.  And when my son was here he would always go crabbing.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And we would get all this fresh crab and he was always real good at getting -- getting it, so ...
R:  Really?
L:  You know, I thought I'd miss him [inaudible] going back to Missouri, I don't get my fresh crab anymore.
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  See I don't -- I -- I don't have the patience to sit there and sit there and wait and, you know, and --
R:  Oh, I've never done it.
L:  -- have to wheel in the -- the -- the crab net and -- and all that there.  
R:  Oh.  I -- I don't know what I would do with a crab after I caught it.  I wouldn't want to kill it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  You have to sit there and boil the water and just drop the live crab in the water.  [MN]
R:  Oh, geez, yeah.
L:  I always felt --
R:  I'd rather go buy it in the store.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Where they're already dead --
R:  Actually --
L:  -- and, yeah.
R:  -- there's been a few times where we just -- we couldn't -- a night at Red Lobster is at least gonna be fifty, sixty bucks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's our perfect meal.  Just -- we just really love it.  So instead we just go to the grocery store, get the crab.
L:  Right.
R:  Get the potatoes and everything and it -- and we get some shrimp and we've been able to make some really nice dinners at home, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that sounds good right now.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So I'm sitting here fixing dinner right now.  
R:  Oh.  Yeah, and it's almost that time.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So that's, yeah.
L:  Husband gets around four thirty and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so ...
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's pretty good.  I -- I just like it -- the only thing I don't like about going out is 'cause you have to tip --
L:  I -- I know.
R:  -- and it just becomes so expensive.  
L:  I know it.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, that's just about the worse thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean we appreciate them there [MN], you know, walking back and forth brining our food.
L:  Right.
R:  But sometimes, you know, it -- depending on the meal.  If it's -- it -- if it's something intricate like Italian food, like you were saying lasagna.  That's more difficult to make at home.  
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Especially --
L:  No, I -- I don't make it very often.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Do you make your own dough and everything?
L:  No.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  No, I'm not that far into -- into cooking.  But --
R:  My mom --
L:  -- I -- I --
R:  -- has a friend.  She's a --
L:  -- don't mind cooking though.  Uh, just ...
R:  I do it everyday.  Now do you have a family?  Oh, you said that --
L:  Well, yeah, I'm --
R:  -- your -- your son's grown, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah, my -- my -- both my kids are [MN] out -- out of the house now.  My daughter's twenty two and my son's nineteen.
R:  Now do you cook as much?
L:  Not really.  A lot of times --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we'll just, you know, get something -- eat something real quick or, you know, or maybe grab a pizza on the way home.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  At will.  
R:  Yeah, I -- I just started cooking.
L:  Uh, we go camping a lot and it's [MN] whenever we go camping it's easier to cook for just two because I guess I got a little grill with us instead of hauling the big grill along with us.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Sandwiches do just fine most of the time too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've got a -- almost a two year old so I've just started really cooking the last year since now I have --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to, you know, before it was really simple meals but now that the baby's getting older and she's eating real food and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm starting to make those dinners every night and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never did.  I thought, you know what, I'm gonna have a family.  Why start now?  I'll have to do it for the [LAUGH] rest of my life.  
L:  I [LAUGH] know.  Yeah, well, my kids -- my -- my daughter says she misses me cooking for her.
R:  Oh.  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  She's back in Missouri too.  They -- they decided to go back there.  They missed, you know, Missouri so ...
R:  So, um, do people have different favorites in Missouri compared to out here?
L:  Not really.  
R:  Is it pretty much the same?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  I know where I come from in Missouri there's a lot more restaurants than there are -- I'm in the Sacramento area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, I was from the Springfield, Missouri, area.  And I couldn't believe that there was so many more restaurants in Springfield than in Sacramento, even.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, there are just restaurants everywhere you look.  [LAUGH]  Seems like, you know ...
R:  Oh.  Are they more -- are they chain or are they more a lot of, um, private --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- partly owned or ...?
L:  There are some chains.  Uh, my -- my favorite fast food restaurant back there was Steak 'n Shake.  And I miss Steak 'n Shake.  They had the best -- they would have -- they didn't call them hamburgers.  They called them steak burgers.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, oh, they were so good.  Uh, I do volunteer work for the Sheriff's department here and, uh, servi- the office mana- service, uh -- office manager, or whatever.  She, um, um, talks about them.  [inaudible] her husband from the midwest and they go to v- visit Illinois all the time and she goes the first thing they do is stop at Steak 'n Shake so --
R:  Oh, how funny.
L:  -- me and her talk about Steak 'n Shake.  [LAUGH] 
R:  There's absolutely none in California?
L:  None.  
R:  Oh.  
L:  They're -- they're -- they're no further east of the Missouri River.  West of --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the Missouri River.  
R:  Don't you hate that?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, I do.  'Cause that's a long ways away.  
R:  [LAUGH]  It is.  'Specially -- well, In and Out finally came up this way.  I remember way back when I used to live in the Bay area and they were just putting the first In and Out's in, um, [LIPSMACK] Pleasanton -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- area.  I love those.
L:  Oh, they -- I do too.  They don't have In and Outs in Missouri.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...  But they do have the Steak 'n Shakes so I guess it's --
R:  What a- -- 
L:  -- about even trade.
R:  What about Sonic?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Are there Sonics back there?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  'Cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they were in Texas when I lived there and they've just --
L:  I've --
R:  -- started coming out this way, I think.
L:  Yeah, I think there's one somewhere over, um, some by -- somewhere where it was close to the coast.  Round Santa Rosa or -- not Santa Rosa.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Somewhere around in that area.  Round in there.
R:  And we've got one in Fresno.
L:  Is there one in Fresno?
R:  Up here too.  Yeah.  Yeah, believe it or not.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have some distant relatives that live in Fresno.  
R:  There's, you know what, there's a lot of restaurants in Fresno.  'Cause there's nothing else to do here.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  There's tons of theaters and there's -- there's lots of, um, fast food and -- and dine in.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we've -- we've got pretty much almost every chain you can think of so ...
L:  Really?  Wow.
R:  Yeah, it's -- we -- we eat a lot of fast food.  And [MN] I hate it.  But, you know, it's fast.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I like buffet.  Since it's just me and my husband here now, you know. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  He has -- he also has two kids from a -- from a previous marriage so we have -- I have two and he has two.
R:  Oh, so you ...
L:  His are both gone too so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  Well, you go --
L:  It's nice just the two of us.  
R:  You go from no cooking to everyday to back to hardly any cooking.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...  But it -- it's nice just having --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the two of us.  It's -- it's nice to be able to just to get up and take off whenever we want.  Just like la- last Thursday.  My husband comes home.  "You want to go camping?"  
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, sure.  You know.  So I get out there.  Have to take -- couple a hours later we're all packed and ready to go and ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  We -- we have a fifth wheel.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  So it's nice camping in a fifth wheel.  We have a little microwave in there and it has air conditioning so ...
R:  So you guys cook at home a lot in your camper.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, so it's [MN] going +camping. 
R:  Oh, we have a --
L:  But we're going camping again this weekend.
R:  We have an RV.  And I think we might be trading, I don't know.  Not sure yet.  Um, we just saw this, um, a trailer because we don't have a truck.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So we have to pull it.  But it was pretty cute.  It was a lot smaller 'cause this one seats, uh, six nine.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's just so big.  And because we've got a big family, not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- immediate but our moms and dads and sisters, brother and everything.  So ...  But, um, we have cooked some good meals in that thing.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Uh, 'cause you just throw everything on.  Hamburgers is so easy and ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Going down the road making a sandwich.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So ... 
L:  So, uh, my husband --
R:  Grocery stores loves us, huh?
L:  -- wants to get -- yeah.  My husband wants to get a motorhome when he retires and just travel.
R:  Yeah.  That's a good idea.
L:  Um, that'd be nice.  It's only --
R:  Hopefully they --
L:  -- fourteen years away.
R:  [LAUGH]  Hopefully the gas is a lot cheaper.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Let's hope so, yeah.  In Missouri it's been a little bit cheaper.  It's like -- when it was almost two dollars here it was like a dollar forty in Missouri.  
R:  Oh, that's not bad.  So does it get down --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- close to a dollar when it's really low.  
L:  I haven't tal- asked my -- you know, I usually talk to my sister every now and then.  She just tells me what the gas prices are there and wants to know what they are here.  But she hasn't asked for a long time.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, that --
L:  And I never think to ask her.  [LAUGH]  
R:  That, um, yeah, we don't drive to Fresno as much because that's basic -- like I said, you know, that's where all the restaurants are for us so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we don't really drive that -- that way.  My husband has to go there everyday for work so when it comes to going out to dinner usually we just go to a little place around here and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Gas is too expensive. 
L:  I know.  Yeah, we live -- we live out in the country so even to go to the grocery store it's like twelve miles.  
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  So ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  So it's -- it's -- it's -- it's pretty far for anywhere we go.  
R:  So you stock up on food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I --I go -- go grocery shopping probably twice a month and, you know, just get everything I need and ...
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  'Cause I just -- I hate that drive into town.
R:  Uh-huh.  I can imagine.  We used to live like that, uh, in Texas.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  We lived out on -- by the lake.  It was like a -- a smaller area.  A -- a lot of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- older people lived in there.  And it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like twelve miles to town.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And for a kid, that's horrible.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] That -- that -- that -- we have this little town grocery store
