L:  Hi, this is Sienna.
R:  Hi, this Julie.
L:  And which do you like?  To eat at home?  I l- I like both.
R:  Uh, I like both.  I think, um, if I'd rather I think I'd rather go out to dinner.
L:  Okay.  I don't like to cook.  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So [LAUGH] um, well, you know, with the food, um, going grocery shopping and going to the store, choosing the things, putting 'em in the basket, taking 'em out and then having to pack them, put 'em in the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- car, bring them home, unpack, cook, clean.  That's really much too much involvement with the food.
R:  Right.
L:  For me.
R:  Right.  I -- e- even though, I tell you, my lifestyle demands for me to eat at home more.  
L:  Okay.
R:  A- and to eat home --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- because when you have little kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, it's very hard to [LAUGH] go out and enjoy, you know, a dinner out at a restaurant.  But, um, I'd have to say my favorite kind of food though is [MN] would be Italian food.  
L:  Uh.  
R:  Like pasta and spaghetti and fettuccine alfredo, if I had my choice.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Wh- what is --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- your favorite food?
L:  I think it, um, varies by season and mood.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  Sometimes I have a craving for, um, just, uh, crab.  You know, just crab meat.  And other times I have a craving for, mm, something simple and spicy.  And I would really like to venture out into, um, recipes that I -- of things I don't -- I don't eat.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  On a regular basis.  Because if I cook for myself it's gonna be something tried and true and really, really simple.
R:  Right.
L:  But when I watch, um, the food shows on PBS on Saturdays.  I say, "Oh, that looks great".  And then I read, um, mm, recipes like in the New York Times or in another really nice magazine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'll say, "Gee whiz, I sure would like to try that".  Um, but as far as going out and buying all of the ingredients and coming home to make them.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if I'm ever gonna get around to that.  
R:  [LAUGH]  That's what's, uh, difficult in a recipe is just coming up with all the different, um -- having everything on hand.  Like you'll find a particular recipe and you think, "Oh, that sounds good".  [MN]  To g- -- to have everything on that recipe, you know.  
L:  Um, do you have all, um, ingredients in -- in your cabinet?
R:  No, I don't.  I typically get something here or there if I see a recipe.  But, um, [MN] no, I don't have like all the ingredients.  
L:  So what was the most recent recipe you have, um, tried?
R:  Um, [MN] in fact tonight I cooked, um, beef and broccoli.  
L:  Oh.  Stir fry?
R:  Uh, stir fry.  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  
R:  And, uh --
L:  Okay.  
R:  E- even though it was kind of a short cut recipe.  I mean, it was a -- I didn't make the sauce completely myself.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  Got it from a can?
R:  Uh, well --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the -- the [MN] like a [MN], uh, Sunbird, you know, the little -- beef and brown -- the seasoning.  
L:  Oh, sure.  Sure.
R:  The oriental seasoning.  
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  When you mix the seasoning up with, um, soya sauce and --
L:  And the -- and the vegetables came frozen?
R:  Right.  You just --
L:  Okay.  
R:  Right.  So as far as totally fresh from a recipe, I'm very rarely do like total -- I mean totally fresh.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And I think, uh --
L:  I -- my daughter cooks, um, she loves to cook.  And she is just so good at it.  And I'm really surprised, even though I know she's always been, you know, she's always loved food.  But I sort of just count on her.  You know one time a couple a years ago I was at her place, um, for New Year's Eve -- New Years and, you know, the traditional, um, peas and so on, you know.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, for New Years.  And my youngest daughter says, "Oh, Shanie[?], Mama's eating like she's been homeless".  You know, I [LAUGH] was just so happy to have someone elses food to eat and hers was good.  
R:  Hm.
L:  So ...  But as far as cooking myself, um, [LIPSMACK] mm, I don't know.  So why do you think men are the chefs in the restaurants?
R:  Uh, you know, that's a good question.  I -- I think, um, [MN] I think typically I -- that -- that is a really good question.  I -- even though I -- I would think that if you -- at culinary art schools there's just as many women as there are men.
L:  Okay.
R:  But typically when you go to a restaurant you see just men chefs.  
L:  What's the deal?
R:  So, uh -- that's -- that's a good question.  
L:  Yeah, I bet there are just as many women.  Traditionally there have been but I don't even hear about women --
R:  Right.
L:  -- chefs that -- that much anymore.  
R:  Right.
L:  Well, we don't call them chefs anymore.  We just call them cooks, right?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And we call men chefs.
R:  Uh, I think it depends on the type of restaurant you go to.  You know, if it's more of an upscale restaurant they're chefs.  
L:  Okay. 
R:  And if it's more of a, you know, family +eatery, you know, down at Friendly's or -- or D- at Denny's then they're cooks.  They're not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- chefs.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, well you sound --
R:  You know, I would think.
L:  -- friendly so are you in Ohio.  Are you in the mid west?
R:  Uh, [MN] no, in Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Well, that's pretty close.  Ohio --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- borders on Pennsylvania.  Okay.  Great.  Well, I know, um, what's -- what's your favorite restaurant then?
R:  Um, my favorite restaurant, mm.  Um, my favorite absolute restaurant to go out to eat would have to be, um, Japanese.
L:  Oh.  Sushi?
R:  Japan- a Japanese steakhouse.  
L:  Okay.  Benny Hana's[?] like that.
R:  Where they cook it in front of you and all.  Yeah.  What would --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- be your favorite restaurant?
L:  I -- I don't -- I don't know.  I, um, last year I ate once a week at, um, McDonalds company's, um, new, upscale -- there's just one step up.  Japodlay[?].  Now do you have those --
R:  No.  We don't.
L:  -- where you are?  McDonalds, you know, they left, um, they -- they built another tier --  
R:  Huh.
L:  -- to their -- to their company and so this is, uh, it -- it features Mexican cuisine and I think Japodlay's, um, um, the decor is Aztec.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's like, um, and the chicken tacos --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you get [MN] --
R:  Now where is that?  Where are -- where are you at?
L:  I'm in -- I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, you're in Minne- -- okay.  
L:  Yeah.  And so, you know, the -- the chicken tacos are soft shell.  I didn't eat the shell but when you fill it with the corn and the lettuce and, uh, guacamole and [LAUGH] and the cheese and, um, the spices.  That was really exciting to me.  However, I don't think I can eat there anymore after --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- once a week.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  I haven't heard and now what was the name of that?
L:  Japodlay.  
R:  Japodlay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh.  I haven't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- heard of that.  
L:  Yeah.  And so it's McDonalds, you know, sort of -- it's the next level.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Above the hamburger.  And I think it's the only -- they'll -- you know, so they only have two levels.  And otherwise I don't know.  I think I've been on -- on such a budget within the last year that, mm, I -- I don't think I do upscale --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that much anymore.  
R:  No.  Very rare- -- yes.  Very rarely, myself.  I have a -- we have a family of five so for us to go --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- out to dinner it's -- it's pretty rare these days.
L:  And so how -- how -- what's the range of -- of your children?
R:  Uh, I have two toddlers and one teenager.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  Hold on, I've gotta finish this call, okay?  
L:  Okay.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  All right.  Um, now when you go -- well, the teenager cost and -- when my kids were -- were young I ate out a lot.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, you know, we took advantage of the children prices and that's probably why my daughter cooks so well now because she's had too many, um, brown bag lunches.  You know, with the chocolate chip [LAUGH] cookie as her ...
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  As her dessert, you know, from the --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- peanut butter sandwich and ...
R:  Yeah.  I found --
L:  The milk.
R:  -- um, when my -- when my oldest daughter was little I a- ate fast food most of the time.  But, um, when you, you know, have the growing family and three children and, you know, two adults to eat out is pretty pricey.
L:  It is. But --
R:  You know so we --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- maybe go --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- out to eat, you know, like, um, twice a month.  You know.
L:  All of you?
R:  Usually --
L:  Together?
R:  -- on a Sunday.  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  Do you do the buffet?
R:  Usually like after church.
L:  Yeah.
R:  U- um, typically like either Cracker Barrel or a buffet. 
L:  Okay.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I find myself once in a while, um, let's say, maybe once a -- a season craving a steak. 
R:  Mhm.
L:   And then I'll go to the steakhouse and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mm, and I, um -- for work I go to Wendy's almost every day and I just get --
R:  Oh, yeah.  As far as fast food, Wendy's is my favorite.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And like --
R:  Wendy's is my favorite.
L:  -- you know, I'm on a budget so that works.  You know, a dollar -- a dollar, um, seven cents, you know, the ninety nine cents small chili.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so that works for me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, five dollars a week.
