R:  Hi, this is Cindy.
L:  Hi, I'm Michaela.  
R:  Hi.  Um, the subject was friends?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Okay.  You want to go first or ...?
L:  [MN]  Um --
R:  You want me to go first?
L:  [MN]  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Do you have a lot of friends?  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I have a lot of acquaintances and a few close friends, I'd say.
R:  That's how I am too.  I work with a thousand people [LAUGH] and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have a lot of acquaintances.  Go to their shindigs and whatever they [LAUGH] call them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Low level parties and we're all close acquaintances but I only have a -- I have a few close friends and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- two of them moved out a -- well, one of them w- -- has been my friend since I was nine and but -- but I moved out of state when I was twelve but we're still friends.  [MN]
L:  Well, that's good.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  The internet lets us talk a lot so we talk a lot on the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- internet.
L:  [COUGH]  
R:  And then I have another close friend that lived out here but she, um, moved to Oregon and we talk all the time on the phone and the internet too.  
L:  Yeah, I have a couple of good friends that live out of state.  
R:  Do you?  That's good.  And, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- still I talk to -- I like to still talk to them a lot and I have a real close friend out here too.  But you -- but, um, I'm a mom so I'm pretty -- and so's she so we're pretty busy.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So we don't get together much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
L:  I try to but sometimes the schedule gets in the way.  It seems that what happens is that, um, I'll go for weeks and not have any social life and then all of a sudden I'll see all my friends, like, in one week.  
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Night after night after night.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's a busy week.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, that's good, yeah.  I do -- I tend to do that sometimes too.  And I have like a lot of, um, acquaintances that my husband works with the husband and then I'm friends, kind of, with the wife.  Or I guess you call them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more acquaintance.
L:  [COUGH]  
R:  And they still --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  They still act real nice and we go over like I'm their good friend.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Yeah, that's always -- that's always so interesting.  I just saw some people that I hadn't seen in -- in two years actually and they all, you know, acted like we'd been together, you know, and you -- for years.  I hadn't even talked to them for two years.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.
R:  Well, that's neat.  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm in New Mexico.
L:  And I haven't talked to them since I saw them two weeks ago either, so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm in New Mexico and everyone out here is real friendly.  Even when they don't like you they're friendly.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's just like everybody just tries to get along if they can so ...
L:  Well, that's nice.  [LAUGH] 
R:  At least the people I know.  At least in front of your face.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then I tend to tell people [LAUGH] usually what I think.  Even though I'm usually a really nice person but every now and then.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  I can only take so much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, you know, sometimes it might help to actually be told what people really think of you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You might not have noticed.  
R:  I'd rather someone just told me.  [LAUGH]  Even though I -- I wouldn't like it, I'd still like it better than finding out from someone else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  Yeah.  So, yeah.  I guess I have, uh, just a f- a few close friends and the rest are just mainly acquaintances and stuff but ...  And you know your friends, you're close friends from school?
L:  Um, most of them are people that I've met through school.  I'm a graduate student so pretty much that's [LAUGH] all I do is go to school.
R:  Oh, boy.  Yeah.
L:  So ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That's a lot of work so you -- I'm surprised you have time to do anything.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [several inaudible words] social life.
L:  Well, you know, sometimes we just, uh, do that instead of doing --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- work.  
R:  [LAUGH]  That's always good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah, I'm at -- I'm -- I didn't, uh, go to college except for a couple of years and, um, it was just, uh, um, it was just a community college but most of my friends I've known from high school.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's weird that I'm thirty two and I still have friends from when I was fourteen.  [LAUGH]  So it's a long time.
L:  My mom is like that.  She actually just found someone she'd been friends with in fourth grade that they'd lost touch.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And now they're like best friends again.
R:  That's neat.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  The one friend I've -- that I was friends with since I was nine we -- when I moved out of state we talked a lot and then we lost touch.  And then I found her again and, um, it was weird.  We had like almost identical lives.  It was so --
L:  Wow.  
R:  -- weird that.  [LAUGH]  Like we've -- at the time I wasn't married so -- and I had my first child and our children are like two months apart, our older children.  And --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it was just weird --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and she wasn't married either.  And she was living with her boyfriend too.  So it was just kinda weird the way it [LAUGH] was.
L:  Yeah.  That's really [LAUGH] interesting.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then, yeah, and -- but now [MN] our lives are a little bit -- bit different but ...  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, sorry, I'm just taking a siesta.  That many years we could've still been.  Too bad we don't live in the same state.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's the only bad thing about moving.  You lose your --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- friends.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Where do you live?  What state are you in?
L:  I live in New York?
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's where I grew up in.  Long Island.  In [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Are you in a suburb?
L:  I'm -- I live in New York City now.  But I grew up, um, in Penam[?] County.  
R:  Oh, wow.  Well, that's neat.  Yeah, I --
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, [MN] people out here, as far as friends, are a lot different than out there.  It's just totally different.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I have a friend that, um, moved to Texas and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when I talk to him it's like everything is so different.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, you don't even have an accent.  You know, they --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- are different in Texas.  That's where my husband's from.  Texas.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he just -- everyone just -- they just talk to people they don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  All the time.  
L:  I'm sure my grandfather does that but, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm not sure how much of that has to do with, uh, anything other than he just [MN] he's just strange [LAUGH] so ...
R:  [LAUGH]  But it's funny they like to make friends with someone they're in line with, but they're not as friendly with other people they know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  Someone they never met.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's kind of odd.  Have you taken these calls before?
L:  Yeah, this is my second one.  
R:  Mine too.  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah.  This -- has it been ten minutes?
L:  Uh, it's been -- I'm on my cellphone so according to my cellphone it's been about eight.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  So just a little --
R:  I can't think of anything --
L:  -- [LAUGH] ...
R:  -- else to say about friends except for ...
L:  No.  
R:  I try to be a really good friend and do whatever I can for that person because -- 'cause, um, especially for like a good friend because that's what they're there for.  They do really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good things for you.  Go out of their way for you and then you just -- and then you do really good things for them.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess that's basically what friends are there for whenever you need 'em.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I [several inaudible words] --
L:  One hopes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well -- well you would hope so, huh?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  That's when you find out who your real friends are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you go through --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a hard [LAUGH] time and they're not there.  
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And that's better though.  Sometimes it's better to find out anyway to get rid of 'em.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I read this email about friends the other day.  I should -- if I would've known that's what the call was about I would've printed it up.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It said something like best friends are -- no, they said friends when they come over, um, might ask you for something to drink.  But a best friend just goes in your fridge and just grabs something.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that's -- that's true.  
R:  Uh-huh.  And --
L:  I think.  Definitely.
R:  -- it said other things like that.  I can't remember what the rest of it was about but -- but, yeah.  Friends -- I think friends are the best thing and -- and -- are you married?
L:  Yeah.  No.
R:  No?  And, yeah, when you get married it's like [NOISE] your spouse is your best friend.  [NOISE]  Even though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you hate them sometimes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  But they're always -- that's someone who should always be there for you.  
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  Yeah, definitely.  
R:  But, um, I can't think of anything else to say about friends.
L:  No, it -- it's so --
R:  Can you?
L:  No, not really.  I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's pretty much covered it.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.  These calls are kind of funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Talk [inaudible] --
L:  The last -- the first one I had was about restaurants and, I mean, you know --
R:  Oh, that would've been --
L:  -- if you don't live in the same place as someone it's kinda hard [LAUGH] to ...
R:  Oh, well, yeah.  The last girl I talked to was from New York too.  So that was [inaudible] ...
L:  That's interesting. 
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]  So when I saw the ten thousand dollar winners they weren't from New York.  So I thought, oh --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I bet there's a lot of them from New York now.  But ...  They weren't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the winner.  [LAUGH]  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  I think they been advertising this in -- in the local papers a lot so ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I guess that's probably why.  
R:  Oh, that's why.  Yeah. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They don't advertise anything like that in the paper here.  I've --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- been telling my friends [LAUGH] about it.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So they can make some quick money.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Mm, quick money's good.  [LAUGH]  I think.  
R:  Huh?
L:  Quick money is usually good.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It is.  Um, yeah, that's all I can think about friends.  
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [LAUGH] I hope our ten minutes is [LAUGH] up.
L:  Yeah, my phone says it is but I guess there was a little part at the beginning where they gave us the instructions and it didn't count.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Because my phone says I've been on it for ten [LAUGH] minutes. 
R:  Um --
L:  So ...
R:  I can't think of anything else about friends.  Well, I do telemarketing and everybody like, yeah, you have to like make them your friend to sell to them.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, so then you have --
R:  So they [inaudible] like you --
L:  -- to be pretty good at this.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [several inaudible words] friend thing.
R:  Yeah.  I'm used to [LAUGH] talking.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But you say -- but most of the time it's like a script and it's a little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- bit easier but, yeah, they become like your five minute friend.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's kinda neat 'cause you talk to people from all over the country and hear about ...  It's kinda fun.
