L:  That's number one.  But --
R:  Yeah.

R:  I know.  Maybe eating all that old -- that'd be, [LAUGH] you know, stuff off the ground and putting it in a frying pan with some grease.
L:  Mhm.  You just say [inaudible].
R:  I don't want to do that.  
L:  Yeah, you go over to their house and you don't know what you eat and so I -- I --

R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- I really do.  I like going to a restaurant better.  You know, the service and everything and just being in a different atmosphere.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know.
R:  But I don't like them -- I don't like them like -- I'll go to 'em but I don't really like them little cheap restaurants.  They be having your-- your [inaudible] -- your silverware half -- half, um, cleaned, that stuff.  
L:  Mhm.  Oh, when that happens I, you know, I tell them they got to take it back.  I mean, I always complain.  I used to be a waitress and, uh, years ago.  My deal when I was in high school and -- and, um, so I complain.  I will really complain.  I'll be coming out there with a free meal.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  For everything.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  And for the silver you're getting over.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So, I mean, but it's -- but I've -- you know, going out is something that -- that's, um, is good to get out and see other people and everything and have the opportunity to meet other people which you do at a restaurant.  Especially if it's like a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like a restaurant bar type thing or something or ...  You know.  Or, uh, something like Gillians.  They have the restaurant and they have a bowling alley and bar and stuff and, you know, so ...
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, it's good to get out, you know.  
R:  So, do you, um, what was I going to say?  Don't take this the wrong way.  But do you have a boyfriend?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have a boyfriend.  Oh, you'll be going out?
L:  Yeah, well, see I'm just starting a relationship.  I'm married actually so ...

L:  Yeah.  Separated.  But --
R:  She's married.  
L:  But -- but so, yeah.  And starting another relationship.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Before my divorce [several inaudible words].  
R:  Oh.  
L:  You know.  But, you know, it's all good.  You know, 'cause my husband's the one that messed up so ...  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm -- had to deal with the after effects of that and, you know, I found somebody that's really nice to me and, you know, and he took me out.  We went out on a date.  My friend had fixed us up.  Her -- she's married and -- and it's a friend of her husbands.  And we live in two different states but --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- you know, we're gonna try to see each other as much as we can.
R:  Try to make it work?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I've never had a over in the state -- the interstate thing before, so we just gotta see how that's gonna work.  But, I mean, we went out to dinner and we went to Ruby Tuesdays for dessert and it was really nice.  I mean, it's like one of these desserts with the [COUGH] they had a cake and had cake and ice cream and oriole cookies and some kind of syrup stuff on it.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And it was really good.  They gave us two spoons and, boy, we took it to town. Girl, we -- we ate it all.
R:  [LAUGH]  Man, that's what I feel like [inaudible].
L:  He was just, like, whoa.
R:  Talking about food.  I'm about to go, um, [LAUGH] go out tonight to [several inaudible words]. 
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  [inaudible].  Yeah.  
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know where I'm gonna go.  I'll just go find somebody.  You don't want to go to a restaurant tonight now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  
L:  That's why I wish I was going somewhere but, um, next time it'll be next month and we're gonna go out and hopefully we'll get to go out to a nice restaurant then too, because we were supposed to meet at a Greek restaurant and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the Greek restaurant they have, like, lamb and stuff.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I had wanted to try that but I got there like two hours late for our date.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause I had to -- had to drive, you know.  So I get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there, like, two hours late and I -- and I [MN] couldn't use my cellphone and, you know, and I didn't want to get out the car because when I got out the car then that would be longer than it would take for me to get there.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So we finally met up and went to Bahama Breeze and had a good time so, you know.  But I like going out.  Restaurants --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like where my kids -- they like to go like Chucky Cheese, Circus World.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  You got kids?
L:  Yeah.  I got three.  
R:  Oh, dang.  
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  So y'all be going out to restaurants and stuff or you just, you know, you don't take 'em when you go to a good restaurant?  [several inaudible words] go, like to Chucky Cheese and stuff like that. 
L:  Yeah.  Just the Chucky Cheese, stuff like that.  I mean, it's like -- even with -- when I was with my husband we didn't really take them to nice restaurants and that's one mistake that you make because, um -- okay.  But that's one mistake.  That's one mistake that people make because then kids don't know how to act when they go places like that, you know.  But, um, but, you know, I'm gonna start taking them for nice places once I get myself together 'cause right now I can't really take them by myself.  I'd rather have somebody come with me.  You all with me?
R:  Yeah.  Huh?
L:  And so, uh -- you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  How long is this conversation supposed to be?  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's supposed to be ten minutes.  We been on here for ten minutes and thirty five seconds.  
L:  Are you seri- -- okay.  And, um, so, you know, but I'm, you know, going out and, um, really nice, and, um --
R:  Oh, the, um [NOISE] No.  [NOISE]  Never.
