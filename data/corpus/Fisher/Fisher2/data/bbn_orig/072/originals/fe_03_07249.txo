R:  Hi, my name is Judy.
L:  Hi, I'm Kathy.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi.  So which do you like best?  Eating at a restaurant or eating at home?
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, it depends on my mood actually.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, if I'm lazy and tired I'd rather go out to a restaurant.  If I want to not bother to get changed and dressed I'd rather eat at home.
L:  Do you do most of the cooking at your house?
R:  I do all the cooking.  I live alone.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And the cats won't cook.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I begged them but they won't cook.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  It's tech- --
L:  They're all like that though.  Cats.  They're all [inaudible].
R:  It's terrible.  They -- yeah, they're very, very, very picky.  
L:  I think I -- I think I prefer to eat at home most of the time, uh, simply because it's just, um, I like to have people around.  I like to have people come in and -- and you know, sit and watch while I cook or -- or cut things up or get ingredients ready or -- and it's more of a -- I find it more of a social thing at my house than I do at a restaurant.  
R:  Oh, I agree.  At -- with that I absolutely agree.  Sometimes if I'm not in a great mood I'll just see what's in the fridge and call my -- my friend who lives upstairs, or my friend a couple a blocks away, and I'll say, come on we'll just throw something together and have dinner.
L:  Yeah.  Isn't it -- isn't it the best though when it's like that?  When it's just an impromptu thing.  I think that's probably, I don't know if that's a perfect meal but it's a perfect situation.  
R:  Well, it's -- right, it's not a perfect meal but it's absolutely no pressure which is always wonderful.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And --
R:  Because that helps you really enjoy everything.  You can sit, relax, doesn't make a difference if everything is spic and span.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, because it's so spontaneous.  You know, your friends don't really care and you just sit and you -- they help you or you sit and you schmooze and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know.  Just relax and so it -- it that --
L:  'Cause that's why -- it's --
R:  -- really is enjoyable.  
L:  Well, when I find sometimes when I'm at a restaurant there's sort of, um, you just get to that really great part of the conversation and someone wants to know if your meals are all right or can they get you anything else or ...  And even though the wait staff's being really polite and they're saying excuse me, whatever.  It's still -- and it's not a -- it's not a nice flow.  There are interruptions.  There are, you know, you're sort of waiting on people to bring you food and whatever.  So I just kind of like it at my house I think a lot better.  Or somebody elses house.  Don't get me wrong.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You know.  
R:  Yeah, well that's -- that's --
L:  I'm [several inaudible words] to bring a covered --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dish to someone elses house too.  
R:  No, that's -- that's good too.  But usually if, uh, I'm going with some people and we, you know, if you go into a -- a nicer restaurant you can usually tell the wait staff, um, listen we will let you know if we need anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that they will, you know, I'll tell them, we'd rather not be interrupted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because we're just relaxing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, you're not not doing your job, but if you could just, you know, we'll let you know if we -- if we need something. 
L:  I've only just realized that.  
R:  [COUGH]  
L:  I've -- it -- it took me a while to realize that I could do that.  Um, but I --
R:  Ah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I [inaudible] -- yeah, it took -- it took me a while to say -- to realize that I could say, "No, please take that back" or "No, I'm not ready now".  Or, no, you know.  We just went out, um, Saturday to a -- a, sort of, a Italian type restaurant and -- and the -- it was just coming at us way too fast.  
R:  Right.
L:  And just sort of said, no.  This is, you know, we had the salad and the entree and everything on the table at the same time.
R:  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, uh, no.
L:  And, no, no, no.  We said -- we just sort of sent it back and said --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know.  And that was, sort of, maybe the fifth time in our lives we've [LAUGH] ever done that.
R:  Uh, well, I have always been a proponent of the theory that if I pay you play by my rules.
L:  Okay.
R:  That's how it goes.  
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  I pay.  You play by my rules.
L:  Yeah.  And I think -- and I think I'm better at that now than I used to be but, you know I -- it's -- I think, it -- I also go out much less often than I used to be.  So I'm a little more --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, you know -- 
R:  [inaudible]. 
L:  I want -- I want it to be a nice experience because it's not going to happen again next week.  You know.
R:  Oh, well, that's true.  
L:  That's -- you know, it's farther -- it's few and far between now than it used to be.
R:  Yeah, well, [LAUGH] thank you -- thank you, President Bush.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And Governor Pataki[?] and Mayor Bloomberg.  Thank you so much.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We really appreciate that.  
L:  Okay, so now we've been able to rediscover the joys of home cooking, you mean?  [LAUGH]  [inaudible] thank you for that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, well that wasn't exactly what I was meaning but, okay, you're just much kinder than I am.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I think that --
R:  You're much kinder.
L:  I think we're supposed to describe our -- our -- our [MN] I guess favorite meal and ...
R:  Oh, favorite meal?
L:  Yeah.  Our -- our idea of the perfect meal.  Did -- did you have -- have you had it yet or [MN] ...?
R:  Well --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- I don't know.  But I know it would definitely be at the River Cafe because --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I love the River Cafe.
L:  Which is [inaudible].
R:  And it would probably be in a spring evening.
L:  Okay.
R:  At twilight.  
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Champagne.
L:  Oh.
R:  Caviar for a -- an entree.  And then probably lobster.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I love lobster. 
L:  I'm allergic to it.  
R:  Oh, sorry about that.  Well you can always have --
L:  I know.  I know.  
R:  You could al- -- well, there's always all sorts of wonderful steak things.  Filet Mignon.
L:  Yes.  
R:  Beef Wellington.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  That's a good --
L:  I think those are good but I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I would probably say -- what the heck is that?
R:  No, that's my -- that's the phone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, sorry.  Okay, I thought [several inaudible words].
R:  That's okay.  I don't -- I don't have -- I'm not answering that.  That's somebody elses telephone --
L:  Right.
L:  -- but it rings up here too.  But, um, and dessert, gosh, I don't know.  Probably key lime pie.  I like nice tangy things.  And --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- a wonderful sala- -- I love salad with, uh, radicchio and arugula and artichokes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, mesculn.  All kinds of little good --
L:  That's a nice mix.
R:  -- little things like that.  
L:  That's a nice mix.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I think I would probably go for, um, something either Greek or Indian.  It's just something that we've, uh, started doing more of lately.  
R:  Oh.
L:  It's like -- it's just very slow.  It's a long process.  It's a different and exotic process.  Indian is nice with, uh, the mix of the hot and the cold.  Um, you know, with cold rice and a hot dish.  It's just about --
R:  Right.
L:  It's just really a nice mix.  And it's also, um, just a slower kind of thing.  But if I was doing a more traditional type of -- I would probably, well, I'm a big fan of shrimp cocktail.
R:  Oh, yummy.
L:  Bring that baby coming.  Yeah.  Bring that coming.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Like [MN] it's funny, I can't eat lobster but I can eat anything else from the bottom of the sea.  I don't --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- know why.  So it would be a lobster -- it would be a -- a -- a -- a sort of a crab, scallop, uh, fest, I think.  With -- whichever.  Proba- -- um, I love Cuckio[?] Saint Jacque, I love it.  
R:  Oh, yummy.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  It just says put me on the hips.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But -- but it's lovely.  
R:  Right.  
L:  And you -- and you know you can eat enough of it with a spoon to make yourself feel good.  And I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- probably would go with something -- I would probably go with, um, a really nice fruit and cheese tray.  Just because you don't see those very often anymore.  And if I couldn't have that --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- I'd go with anything cheesecake, for dessert.
R:  Cheesecake.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm a --
R:  Cheesecake 
L:  I'm a big fan of --
R:  You're a cheesecake person?
L:  Yeah, I am.  I am.
R:  Bake -- I bake a terrific cheesecake.
L:  Do you really?
R:  But not in the summer.  Not in the summer.
L:  Too ho- -- well, it takes an hour and a bit in the oven doesn't it?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, and I'm not, you know, if I have the air conditioner going I'm not -- I'm not putting that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, oven on.  
L:  It's just -- we -- I used to make them but we weren't finishing them.  And I used to be giving them away.  You know, half of them [several inaudible words] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- people.  And now I save it for very, sorta, special occasions, but I do like that home made cheesecake, I think, better than -- than restaurant or -- or store bakery bought.  It's just a denser, nicer flavor.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  It's -- it's an all round dessert isn't it though?  [LAUGH]  I mean --
R:  Cheesecake?  You can never go wrong with cheesecake.
L:  Have you ever --
R:  Ask the Golden Girls. 
L:  Have you ever met anybody who didn't like it?
R:  No.  
L:  I don't think so.
R:  No.  
L:  I can't --
R:  Not so --
L:  -- imagine anybody saying, no, I can't do cheesecake.  
R:  Right.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Or I don't want to.  
R:  Uh, no, I -- I've never had that happen.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Never at all.
L:  No, I don't think I have.
R:  You -- +you never get a refus- -- if you say, "Oh, there's cheesecake".  "Oh, I'll be right there".
L:  Have you ever seen like, I mean, diets just topple like dominoes, eh?  People go, "Well, I can't but I can have -- okay I'll have a little bit".  
R:  Well --
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  -- I -- I have to tell you that as far as I'm concerned I would -- that the word diet doesn't exist in my -- I think that they should take that word out of the English language.  
L:  I don't know anybody though who isn't watching.  Those -- you know, when it -- [MN] well, I'm watching what I eat.  Or I'm --
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, I don't know anybody --
R:  Yeah, [MN] I'm --
L:  -- who's not.
R:  -- watching it as it goes into my mouth.
L:  [LAUGH]  Listen, as far as I'm --
R:  That's watching.
L:  -- concerned it's summertime now so all bets are off.  And an- anything that hits the table is a go, as far as I'm concerned.  If it's fresh, if it's not, if it's barbecued, if it's not, I don't care.  It's just -- it's summertime.  Swimsuit season is here.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, right.
L:  There's no more time --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- left.
R:  Right.  Summertime's a -- I -- what I like is grilling.
L:  So do I.
R:  You know, even on the -- the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fireplace.  On -- on the fire escape.  
L:  Well, you know, and the thing is you can do anything.
R:  [COUGH]  On the grill --
L:  It doesn't -- 
R:  -- yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  It doesn't have to be, um --
R:  Fan- nothing fancy.  
L:  No.
R:  Doesn't have to be fancy.  Right.
L:  And it's quick.
R:  Can be -- right.  
L:  And it is [inaudible] -- 
R:  Clean up is a snap with paper plates.
L:  I was just gonna say, well, between clean up and tin foil. 
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  You're done.  And then you're not standing -- I sort of begrudge every minute I have to stand at a sink.  So as far as I'm concerned if I can fold up dinner and put it in the garbage or the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- compost, I'm good.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That works for me.  Do you actually grill it or ...?
R:  Um, well, actually, [MN] sometimes I'll do it and my -- my friends have a house and we'll go -- they're a couple a blocks away.  I'll go there.  Or sometimes I have a small grill that I just put out on the -- on the fire escape.
L:  Okay.
R:  You know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- one of those charcoal numbers.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, that all works.
L:  Yeah.  See my husband won't let me get near the grill.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Clearly I don't do it right which is --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- [MN], well you know what?  That's okay.  It's two months of my life where I'm not doing it.
R:  Okay.
L:  So that's fine.  I'm all r- I'm all right with that whole testosterone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thing.  [LAUGH]  That's okay.  [LAUGH]  If you --
R:  Right.  If you want to be Mr. Griller, go right ahead.
L:  Exactly.  I will get you every brush and apron you need.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  You can stand there and get singed and sweat.  I'll sit and ha- --
L:  Exactly.  I si- --
R:  I'll sit and have some ice tea.
L:  I'm the -- I'm the girl on the side.  On the patio chair.  
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  And going, "How's -- how's it going?"  And that sort of works for me too.
