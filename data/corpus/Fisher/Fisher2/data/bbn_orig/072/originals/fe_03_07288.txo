R:  Hi.
L:  Hello, this is Rebecca.
R:  Hi, this is Pam.
L:  Oh, I'm from Indiana.
R:  I'm from North Dakota.
L:  Oh, nice to meet you.
R:  [LAUGH]  Nice to meet you.
L:  Thank you.  We're su- -- uh, talking about food?
R:  Right.  And we're supposed to, I believe, say if we like to eat in a restaurant or home better and then, uh, to describe our perfect meal?  I think that's --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- what they said.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  That sounds right.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So how 'bout it?  
R:  Um, you know, I don't really know if I can say that I prefer restaurant over home or vice versa.  I mean, I like home cooked food but once in a while I do like to go out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It really depends on what mood I'm in.
L:  Right.  
R:  I don't know.  I do like, um, I get -- if I -- if spending too much time in restaurants I get tired of that and I want to go -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to home food and vice versa.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm kinda like back and forth on [LAUGH] it.
L:  Right.  I understand.  Well, I'm in Indiana so -- I'm from Florida, so I like southern food.  And we have a hard time finding southern food up here.  
R:  Oh, I b- -- oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm sure you do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I -- I -- I am probably the same way.  I -- I like to eat out but really [MN] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't like to eat out as much as I used to.  I don't know.  I do -- we do a lot of cooking.  Like my daughter likes to home -- like to cook everything by scratch.  And, I don't know.  Everytime we go out to eat it seems like we always have a bad experience.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, no.  That's terrible.  I don't really have that ex- -- I -- I agree with you though in that I used to -- I'm thirty nine.  I mean, I don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how old you are but, um, I used to like to go out more than I do now.  And I think it's because I've sort of had an overabundance of it for a while.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I went out too much and then everything kind of starts tasting the same.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you just want to go back home and do whatever and modify your own recipes and get some kind of a different thing going, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  But ...
L:  Do you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what's your -- what would be your favorite dinner?
R:  My favorite dinner?  Uh, [COUGH] I don't -- favorite dinner.  I kind of like -- I kind of like Mexican food.  I like tacos and that kind of thing.
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  Very, very spicy.  Has to be -- the more -- the spicier the better.  Like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to the point where some -- some other people would probably be laying on the floors.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] no.  
R:  I like it really [LAUGH] hot.
L:  Do you really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  What state were --
R:  So I think I probably --
L:  -- you?
R:  I'm sorry --
L:  South?
R:  -- go ahead.
L:  You're from South Dakota?
R:  North Dakota.  
L:  North Dakota.  Wow.
R:  I lived in Phoenix though for six years.  
L:  Oh, that -- 
R:  So I kinda got hooked on the, you know ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think it's more authentic there and, I don't know, uh, the cilantro makes it a little bit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- more.  You know, I -- I like all those spices and stuff.  
L:  Oh, I love --
R:  I'm big into spices.
L:  -- Mexican food.  I love --
R:  Do you?
L:  -- Mexican food.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I can't -- I don't do it too good at home.  I can do the tacos and stuff but I -- now that I -- I like better in a restaurant 'cause I can't fix it as good.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree with you.  I did live with, um, I -- I had a Hispanic roommate down there for a while and she kind of taught me how to cook some of the more general things.  
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  So I can make some of it but I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- still prefer to go to a restaurant if I am gonna eat Mexican food.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about you?  What's your favorite?
L:  Um ...
R:  I know you said -- you said southern food.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Southern -- I love [MN] southern, just regular, what I call -- I guess people call it comfort food. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like all the, um, fried chicken.  [LAUGH]  All the --
R:  Oh, yum.
L:  -- stuff that's not the best for you but ...
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Fried chicken.  I love all the -- the vegetables, like the butter bean.  I love all that stuff.  
R:  Butter beans?
L:  Mashed potatoes.  Yeah.
R:  Did you say?
L:  Butter beans.  
R:  What -- what is -- is it just -- is that a type of bean or is it just putting butter on regular ...?
L:  No, it's like a -- it's like a lima bean.
R:  Oh.
L:  But smaller.  
R:  Hm.  I've --
L:  And --
R:  -- never even heard of it.  
L:  Yeah.  You might be able to find 'em in the [MN] -- in a frozen food.  I don't know.  
R:  Huh.
L:  Do you all have any -- you all have any southern -- you probably don't have restaurants like that do you?
R:  You know what?  No.  Not -- not where --
L:  Nothing?
R:  -- I'm at.  No.  And I -- I've gone to several of them in other places like a -- when I spent some time in Minneapolis I've gone --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- go to a couple there and I went to a few in Phoenix.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do miss it.  I -- I like that, um, you know isn't cajun basically considered southern?  It is, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- I like that.  Again because it's really spicy.  You know.
L:  Right.
R:  But, no, seriously, I'm in a very rural part of North Dakota right now --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- temporarily.  It's where I'm from and I'm not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- gonna be staying here but I'm here for now.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it's very basic.  It's basic.  Your -- your meat and potatoes.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Your kind of mid west farm.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- type thing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you know, something else I -- we re- really like is barbecue.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  I like -- but not -- barbecue ribs, barb- -- that's okay.  But I like, like, the shredded barbecue pork.  Like the sandwiches.  See that's something else from the south.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess -- I'm not too f- -- I -- I'm -- you know, I'm somewhat familiar with the cajun type thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I'm not too familiar with the other -- something I've always wanted to taste that I thought would be kinda interesting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is, um, what do they call that?  Um, it's -- it's not -- I -- I think [MN] it's something like our, not oatmeal up here, whatever.  But, um --
L:  Grits?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Are you kidding?
R:  I just can't --
L:  You've never had grits?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I'm -- I'm just so curious as to what they [LAUGH] taste like.  
L:  I get such a kick out of people never had grits.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I figured.
L:  That's a southern staple, grits.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  It is wonderful.  They're wonderful.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Really?  What is it exactly?  Is it corn based or like ...?
L:  [SIGH]  I -- uh, you know something.  I don't know.  I don't know.
R:  Huh.
L:  My husband goes to a restaurant up here and it's the only place he can find that he can get grits.  And they'll bring him in a bowl --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like as a side dish.
R:  [COUGH]  Mm.  
L:  But some people in some states eat it like a cereal.  
R:  Well, see --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's what I've heard.  That's why -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it always bring to mind for me -- like we, you know, eat a lot of oatmeal and that kind of stuff up here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that's why I even mentioned that [inaudible].  
L:  It doesn't taste like oatmeal though.
R:  Okay.
L:  No.  It's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- white and it's like little tiny, I don't know what it is.  I really --
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]
L:  -- don't.  I have to find -- I don't know what it is.  But it's good.
R:  Hm.
L:  It's real good.
R:  [MN]
L:  Matter of fact we love grits --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so much and you -- we can find them in Walmart here.  
R:  You can?
L:  Instant grits.  Yeah.  
R:  Oh.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I mean, we've got Walmart --
L:  You have to try 'em.
R:  -- maybe I should try it.  Yeah.
L:  You have to 
R:  Maybe I should see.  
L:  And also they have, um, what is it that we eat?  Um, the biscuits and gravy.  Sausage gravy?
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  You -- you've had that right?
R:  I've had that.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's kind of ...  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I [several inaudible words] so far out of the mainstream.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  No, that's more of a basic here, like the sausage and, you know --
L:  Oh, that's right.
R:  -- [inaudible] and your meat and all that kind of stuff --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, but ...
L:  The only thing I don't really care for is I'm not a seafood p- person.  I don't really care for --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- seafood at all.  And I'm from Florida and that's terrible.  
R:  [MN]  You know, I like, uh, certain seafoods.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Keep the slimy ones away from me, but like the lobster.  I like steak with the steak and lobster together.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And I like, like, the raw shrimp dipped in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that, um, that sauce.  You know.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  But I'm not too b- -- I mean, I wouldn't even consider eating oysters or something like that.  That -- that just grosses me out.
L:  Really?
R:  Or that sushi --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff.  I -- no way.  I -- I -- I had a friend in Phoenix who -- there was a takeout place that was sushi and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [COUGH] he, um, he went there co- consistently and I'd watch him eat this and it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just -- even the smell.  It just gagged me.  I said, "How can you eat that?"
L:  It's raw.  Isn't that raw stuff?
R:  You know.  Yeah, it's raw.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Is what it is.  Like how --
L:  No.
R:  -- can you eat that?  Oh.
L:  I couldn't do that.  
R:  No.  It was --
L:  No, raw fish for me.
R:  No.  
L:  Do you eat --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you all -- do you all have catfish and stuff like that?
R:  You know, not a lot of it.  We have more, um, like the northern and the perch, and that kind of thing.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  We don't -- I mean, there's some I think but it's not as prominent as those other types.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But ...  [MN]
L:  I can e- -- well, if the fish doesn't have -- it's that fishy taste that I don't like.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how some of your ocean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- fish tastes clean?
R:  Yeah.  Like --
L:  You know it doesn't have that really [MN] taste.  I can eat that.  Like, uh, what is it?  Grouper.  
R:  Mhm.  I think that's what it is.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then swordfish doesn't really have that taste either, if you've ever had that at a re- at any restaurant --
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  -- or anywhere.  Yeah, that's not ba- -- it doesn't -- it's not real fishy.  Like -- like --
L:  And there's some --
R:  -- a lot of 'em.
L:  Some other fish, ma- -- well, how do you say that?  Maui[?]
R:  Oh, I know what you mean.
L:  You know what I'm s- -- it's two --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You say it twice or something.
R:  Right.  Right.  
L:  Somebody said that's supposed to be really good.
R:  Hm.  I've never had it.  But I've heard of it.  
L:  Do you all have like real lobsters and stuff there?
R:  Yeah, we do.  But that's about the only seafood place in the entire state.  I mean, there's --
L:  Is it really?
R:  -- plenty in -- yeah, there's --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- one in -- the -- four major, I mean, what we would call cities here but they're, you know, they're not cities in comparison to a lot of the other states.
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's four of them [COUGH] in each of those four and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- other than that it's -- I -- I don't think I've ever seen a seafood establishment besides those.
L:  What restaurant do you like to eat at?
R:  Um, [COUGH] here, I -- I kinda like for what -- for what we have around here, which is kind of minimal, as far as getting you too a more exotic, you know, instead of basic home cooking.
L:  Mm.
R:  I like Applebee's.  You know, we have, um, we have, um, what's the other one that I've gone to here?  [MN]  It's on the tip of my tongue and I can't think of it.  It's --
L:  We have an Ap- --
R:  -- sort of on the order of Applebee's also.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, oh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a TGI Friday's?
R:  Yeah, we've got those.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's -- that's one of 'em too I like.  And I like Chili's  We have got those too.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we have those.
R:  But --
L:  We have those.
R:  What about you?  What's your favorite?
L:  [MN]  [SIGH]  
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, we have this new -- new place that opened up.  I can't -- oh, it's -- it's called Smokey Bones.  
R:  Hm.
L:  And it's just opened up about six --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- months ago and we ate there and it's -- uh, we were so excited.  It's barbecue.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yum.
L:  But it's -- it's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so -- it's so good.  It's --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- really good and the place is packed all the time.  It's right like on the interstate.  They couldn't have -- and right near the mall.  The place is slam packed all the time.
R:  Is it a -- is it a chain or is it just there?  Is it ...?
L:  I guess it's -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I think it's a chain.
R:  Huh.
L:  But I've --
R:  I've never heard --
L:  -- never heard of it.  
R:  I wonder if it's relatively new or something.  Huh.
L:  I don't know.  It's called Smokey Bones.
R:  Hm.
L:  And it's kinda -- it's not a place where you would want to go on a date or any -- or with your husband or whatever.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because it has TVs all over the place. 
R:  Oh.
L:  And on each table is -- you can cha- -- the -- your husband or whoever -- my husband drove me nuts.  You can change the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- channels.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, geez.  
L:  So it's like a lunch --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- type thing or something.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It -- it was pretty funny though.
R:  No channel flippers for that place. 
L:  Yeah, it's just right --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- on the table.  Everybody has -- every table has one.  
R:  [COUGH]
L:  But the food --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- is really, really good.  They have excellent coleslaw.  They make it theirselves.  
R:  Mm.
L:  That, um, we have like in -- in
