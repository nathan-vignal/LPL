R:  Excuse me?  I didn't catch that.
L:  I am Alice.
R:  Oh, Alice.  Hi. 
L:  Yes.  Now do you want my husband also?
R:  Uh, doesn't matter to [LAUGH] me.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [MN]  So ... 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So do you like eating in a restaurant or prefer making ...?
L:  I prefer eating at home?  
R:  Yeah, me --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- too.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You get m- more of what you want that way.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I enjoy cooking so ...
R:  Yes, I do too.  
L:  Mhm.  Yep, I really like that.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It kinda hard now to cook for, uh, just two of us instead of a crowd like I used to have.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can see how that would go.  
L:  In fact --
R:  I seldom have to cook for only myself.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I usually -- I have [NOISE] a couple a kids and --
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, so ...
R:  -- stuff like that.  So ...
L:  Well, we share, uh, my daughter lives close to us and we share leftovers quite often.  In fact, that's what we're doing tonight.
R:  [MN]  Oh, that's neat.
L:  She brought her leftovers and I've got [several inaudible words] mine.  So they're not leftovers to me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Huh.  Interesting. 
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  That's kind of [inaudible].
L:  You have two children you cook for then?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  
R:  Um, and a very fussy man.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Well, my -- my man has to have hot food. 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  It's gotta be hot.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:   So ...  Can you tell me where you're from?
R:  Um, Minnesota.  
L:  Minne- -- oh, okay.  I'm in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in Florida.  
R:  It sounds like it.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  I know someone who lives in Florida so ...
L:  It's just pouring rain right now.  
R:  Is it?
L:  And we need it badly in the northern part of Florida so ...
R:  Oh.
L:  We're glad to have it.  We're in farm country.  
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  So ...
R:  Well, that's good.  
L:  [MN]  You're out west aways then.  
R:  Way up north actually. 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  So ...
R:  We've had a lot of rain lately so ...
L:  Oh.  My son --
R:  Now what --
L:  Pardon?
R:  What -- what was the other thing that they said to ...?
L:  [MN]  Just I think food is all I understood.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  Thought there was another question but ...
L:  Yeah, I didn't take -- I didn't hear the other one.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...  [COUGH]  What kind of food do you cook?
R:  Uh, a little bit of everything.
L:  Everything, huh?
R:  Gotta have a variety.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  So do I.  And --
R:  My favorite meal is -- is just the mashed potatoes and gravy --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and meat and some kind of vegetable --
L:  Some vegetables with it.
R:  -- to go along with it.  
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's our -- seems to be our favorite.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I try an occasional new recipe but not very often.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's me too.
L:  Yeah, so ...  I found out they like them basic things.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Don't want anything else.  
R:  [NOISE]  Mhm.
L:  And we're definitely not Mexican eaters.  We don't care for Mexican food but ...
R:  Yeah.  Me either.  I can't really handle the real spicy stuff.
L:  No, I can't either.  That doesn't appeal to me at --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- all.  [LAUGH]  But the Me- -- um, Chinese does.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I eat --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of stir -- do a lot of stir frying.  Kind of make my own ideal of it.
R:  Yeah, I like Chinese too.
L:  Make it a little bit different.
R:  Yeah, I know, uh, my husband, he likes a lot of spicy stuff --
L:  Oh.  [MN]
R:  -- so once in a while I have to buy a few peppers here --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and there for him to add to his stuff --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- afterwards.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, we went to, uh, Alaska last year and so tried all different kinds of food since we drove out and up into Alaska but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, I was kinda glad to get home to green beans and peas and ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And the basic things.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I know how that is too.  I get really tired of when you're on the go a lot and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't really have time to cook a nice --
L:  To cook.
R:  -- meal, you know.
L:  [MN]
R:  Have to stop and get quick burgers or something.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  In fact my -- my husband told me the other day if he tastes sausage again he'll scream.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Because we had -- we were on a three week camping trip with a couple that -- they were staying with family.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Were staying with us and sausage every morning for breakfast.  And we're just not sausage eaters.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  In fact, we're not breakfast eaters, period.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  So ...  [COUGH]  But -- oh, but wait 'til twelve o'clock, then we're ready to eat at noon.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  So ...  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I wouldn't be able to eat that much sausage.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  It gets too much.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I could [inaudible] my pizza and that's about it.  
L:  Yeah, me too.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  And I could eat pizza constantly.
R:  Yeah.  Me too.  
L:  My idea of pizza is not the quality of it but the quantity of [LAUGH] it.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  So ...  [COUGH]  And of course I'm a little overweight.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  
R:  [MN]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And I totally use coupons for all my grocery shopping.
R:  Oh, me too.  
L:  And, uh, it really made a difference.
R:  Stock up when things are on sale --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and stuff.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  In fact today I spent forty dollars and had twenty four dollars in coupons off [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I'm real tickled with that.
R:  Mhm.  I'm actually cooking venison meatloaf --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for my family tonight.
L:  Oh, now [MN] your husband a hunter?
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, so is mine.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  In fact I wish he'd kill a cow [LAUGH] sometime.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And we can have a little bit of beef.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  My husband, yeah, he's -- he's a hunter too.  So ...  Did get some wild turkey this spring. 
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, one of our sons and grandsons did and we had that last, uh, weekend.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...  But, uh, I get a little bit tired of the [LAUGH] venison.  
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't like much venison --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- myself.  Once in a great while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Otherwise I prefer beef.  
L:  Yeah.  I -- I do too.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  We usually grind -- have it ground up into hamburger or into, uh, cube steak. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And that way I can doctor it up a little bit.
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  That's what a lot of people do.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So ...  This they had, um, made up.  It's seasoned and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- uh, everything ground up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all ready to go so ...
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Just throw it in a pan and fry it. 
L:  [LAUGH]  And fry it.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  [LAUGH]  Yes.  [COUGH]
R:  And we eat a lot of fish too.  
L:  Oh, do ya?
R:  Yeah.  My husband's a heck of a lot more of a fisherman than --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a hunter.  
L:  Oh. 
R:  So ...
L:  Oh.  We don't get much.  My husband doesn't hunt much, uh, doesn't fish much but, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we're not around any fishing area. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Although we did have mullet this weekend.  A --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- friend had fixed it.  And it was really good.  But ...  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- strictly like deep fat fried fish.
R:  Oh, yes.  Me too.
L:  So ...  It -- the only way to eat --
R:  If you bake it I just -- I won't eat it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  It's gotta be crispy.  
L:  Yeah.  Oh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So ...  And I never was much for fish until I met, um, the guy that I'm with and he --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- made some for me and --
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  -- I all of a sudden started liking it again.
L:  You liked it, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]  
R:  So ...  
L:  We had grouper last weekend and stuff.  Visiting friends, some of my husband's class reunion, and they had -- oh, and the fried grouper was so [LAUGH] good.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  We don't get that -- much of that up in, uh, northern part of the state.
R:  Mm.
L:  Like they do in the southern.
R:  Mm, yeah.  That's -- I haven't really tasted much other types of fish besides [inaudible] and ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  [COUGH]
R:  It's about all anybody eats around here.
L:  Yeah.  That I've never had.  I've heard it's good but ...
R:  Oh, it's very good.  It's not very --
L:  It's a [MN] --
R:  -- fishy tasting at all.
L:  Yeah, it's mild.  Good mild --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- fish.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  We have a whiting through this area that is very mild and we --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like that, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't like anything to do with trout.  With the bones and fighting the bones and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And mackerel.  It's too fishy.  
R:  Yeah.  Haven't tried any of that and I probably wouldn't like it either.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Mm.  My husband won't to- touch tuna fish, so, uh, I don't use any of that for cooking.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  He's a non -- non tuna fish man so ...
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  We don't use much of that around here either. 
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  So ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, uh, we got any other subjects we should talk about?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, and I guess we probably just have to keep talking more about food.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  So what else is -- what else do you like?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, we li- -- uh, well, my -- some -- a friend stopped by today and told us that he was getting ready to plough under his squash.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So we better come get some.  And my husband just came back with a box of zucchini and yellow squash.
R:  Oh.  
L:  So I'm gonna do something with that in the next few days.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, uh, we -- we're really in farm country and that -- we -- first year we lived here we put in a garden and then we found out there was no sense in it because these old farmers go ahead and cook or plant no matter how many people are living at home anymore.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ... But, uh ...
R:  Huh.  
L:  So we get it all -- we get it [COUGH] just about all the vegetables we can use usually.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's nice.  
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  I love fresh vegetables from the garden.
L:  Oh, I do too.  [MN]
R:  That's the best.  
L:  Yeah.  We, uh, have a friend that raises a lot of cabbage and she comes over every year, will call us and say, "Can you use a few cabbage?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there's only so many things you can do with that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  So ...  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I haven't gotten as far as making sauerkraut or anything so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm.
L:  It's mostly just +coleslaw.
R:  Mhm.
