UH THE THE TEACHERS THAT HAVE ANY INVOLVEMENT I THINK IT'S THE FUNDING  (fe_03_07971-A-0019)
THAT LIMITS THE TEACHERS IN THEIR ABILITIES AND HOW THEY DO THINGS  (fe_03_07971-A-0020)
FOUR  (fe_03_07971-A-0021)
NO [NOISE]  (fe_03_07971-A-0023)
WHAT DO I DO THIS SITUATION  (fe_03_07971-A-0024)
I READ TO THEM  (fe_03_07971-A-0025)

THERE'S PLEASURE IN READING AND YOU'RE READING AND YOU KNOW AND IF YOU LIKE  (fe_03_07971-A-0027)
TAKE TIME OUT AND LET THEM SOUND OUT THE WORDS WITH YOU WHILE YOU'RE READING WITH THEM  (fe_03_07971-A-0028)
