OKAY I  (fe_03_07956-A-0007)
OKAY  (fe_03_07956-A-0008)
DO THEY GO TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_07956-A-0009)

RIGHT  (fe_03_07956-A-0013)
OKAY  (fe_03_07956-A-0014)
YEAH WELL I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AS A KID UM THROUGH JUNIOR HIGH  (fe_03_07956-A-0015)
AND FOUND [MN] YOU KNOW IT WAS A GOOD EDUCATION I DID GO TO A CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL THOUGH AND UM IT WAS GREAT FOR ME JUST BECAUSE IT WAS ALL GIRLS AND I WAS KINDA SHY  (fe_03_07956-A-0016)
SO THAT HELPED OUT A LOT FOR ME  (fe_03_07956-A-0017)
UM THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS UM IN OUR AREA THEY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CONTROVERSIAL I GUESS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PARENTS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN SATISFIED SO WE ARE SENDING  (fe_03_07956-A-0018)
OUR KIDS TO A CATHOLIC SCHOOL IN OUR AREA  (fe_03_07956-A-0019)
YES I HAVE A SIX YEAR OLD WHO JUST FINISHED KINDERGARTEN AT CATHOLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_07956-A-0020)
AND THEN I ALSO HAVE A A ALMOST ELEVEN MONTH OLD  (fe_03_07956-A-0021)
AND UM  (fe_03_07956-A-0022)
I GUESS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT PRIVATE SCHOOL VERSUS PUBLIC IS THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DISCIPLINE MORE  (fe_03_07956-A-0023)
AND IF KIDS ARE AMAZINGLY UNRULY THEY CAN KICK THEM OUT  (fe_03_07956-A-0024)
SO YOU DO HAVE LESS DISTRACTIONS LIKE THAT IN THE CLASSROOM  (fe_03_07956-A-0025)
AND I THINK THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL IT'S PROBABLY GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE  (fe_03_07956-A-0026)
A LOT OF TEACHERS CAN BE INTIMIDATED BY STUDENTS AT TIMES AND DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY COURSE OF ACTION TO TAKE  (fe_03_07956-A-0027)
THAT  (fe_03_07956-A-0028)
YEAH [LAUGHTER] SO I I FEEL  (fe_03_07956-A-0029)

MM THERE IS UM I JUST SAW IN THE NEWS YESTERDAY ABOUT CHICAGO AND PHILADELPHIA HAVE THESE PROGRAMS GOING NOW WHERE THEY HAVE PRIVATIZED SOME OF  (fe_03_07956-A-0055)
THESE SCHOOLS WHERE A PRIVATE COMPANY HAS BOUGHT OUT SOME OF THE SCHOOLS AND IS RUNNING SOME OF THE SCHOOLS AND THEY'VE HAD SOME GREAT SUCCESS AND I THINK A BIG THING IS THEY'VE HAD THE MONEY TO PUT INTO THEM  (fe_03_07956-A-0056)
TO GIVE UH TEACHER TRAINING  (fe_03_07956-A-0057)
AND SO THEY ARE CONSTANTLY UNDERGOING BETTER TRAINING MORE APPROPRIATE TRAINING TOO MAYBE  (fe_03_07956-A-0058)
AND ALSO ADDRESSING OTHER AREAS  (fe_03_07956-A-0059)
POSSIBLY THE DISCIPLINE AREA MAYBE THEY'RE ALSO ABLE TO HAVE FEWER KIDS IN A CLASS IF THERE'S MORE MONEY FOR MORE TEACHERS THEY CAN SEPARATE THE KIDS MORE AND THAT THEN EACH KID GETS A LOT MORE ATTENTION  (fe_03_07956-A-0060)
SO  (fe_03_07956-A-0061)
