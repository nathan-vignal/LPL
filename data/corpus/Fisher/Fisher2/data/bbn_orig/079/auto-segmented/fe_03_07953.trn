VERY GOOD THANK YOU  (fe_03_07953-A-0002)
WHERE ARE YOU FROM  (fe_03_07953-A-0003)
I'M NEW YORK CITY  (fe_03_07953-A-0004)
YEAH WELL THAT'S A REAL ER ACTUALLY THAT'S A GREAT TOPIC  (fe_03_07953-A-0005)
BECAUSE UH I HAVE A SON THAT'S IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07953-A-0006)
YES  (fe_03_07953-A-0007)
SO UM AND I AND I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING A REAL PROBLEM ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE SAME I [MN] I THINK UM NEW YORK IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS THE REGENTS HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THAT  (fe_03_07953-A-0008)
YEAH WE HAVE REGENTS THAT THE UM [LIPSMACK] KIDS HAVE TO TAKE [MN]  (fe_03_07953-A-0009)
AND IN ORDER TO UM GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL THEY HAVE TO TAKE FIVE UM REGENTS EXAMS IN THE UM  (fe_03_07953-A-0010)
[LIPSMACK] MAIN SUBJECT AREAS LIKE ENGLISH AND MATH AND ALL THAT AND THIS PARTICULAR UH SEASON THEY HAD A A REGENTS IN JUNE AND IT WAS  (fe_03_07953-A-0011)
UH IT CREATED SUCH A F- A FERVOR AMONG [SIGH] UH BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A A CATASTROPHE BASICALLY THEY MADE IT SO UM  (fe_03_07953-A-0012)
ER LET'S SEE SO  (fe_03_07953-A-0013)
SO HARD THAT THE UM [LIPSMACK] THAT THE UH UH UP AT ALBANY NEW YORK WHERE THE WHERE THE BOARD OF ED IS FROM AND WHERE THEY YOU KNOW THEY DESIGN ALL THESE DIFFERENT TESTS AND EVERYTHING  (fe_03_07953-A-0014)
THEY HAD TO INVESTIGATE IT AND NOW THEY HAVE TO THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GONNA THROW THAT TEST OUT SO IT CREATED A LOT OF PROBLEMS FOR THE PARENTS FOR THE KIDS AND SO  (fe_03_07953-A-0015)
MHM  (fe_03_07953-A-0016)
[SIGH] IT'S UM [SIGH] IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A STANDARD OF ACHIEVEMENT  (fe_03_07953-A-0017)
TO MOVE ON WELL NOT TO MOVE ON NECESSARILY SIT THE NEXT GRADE BUT TO USE UM  (fe_03_07953-A-0019)
I GUESS UH TO USE WHEN THEY APPLY TO COLLEGES UM IT'S IT'S SUPPOSED TO  (fe_03_07953-A-0020)
[MN] SET A STAND- A STANDARD OF UH UH OF QUALITY [SIGH]  (fe_03_07953-A-0021)
IT'S NO IT'S IT'S IT'S A SEPARATE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KIND OF A TEST YEAH AND AND AND IT'S ONLY IN LIKE I SAID FIVE SUBJECT AREAS AND UM BUT THEY HAVE TO GET A SIXTY FIVE TO PASS IT  (fe_03_07953-A-0022)
AND UNLESS THEY GET THAT SIXTY FIVE THEY HAVE TO KEEP DOING IT [MN] THEY HAVE TO KEEP DOING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN [SIGH] UNTIL THEY PASS IT AND AND THE SCH- SCHOOL SYSTEM WHERE I WORK I WORK UM [LIPSMACK] THEY  (fe_03_07953-A-0023)
THEY'VE HAD [MN] [MN] TIMES WHERE THE STUDENTS HAVE FAILED IT NUMEROUS TIMES AND THEREFORE THAT CREATES A REAL PROBLEM WHEN THEY BECOME WHEN THEY START TO BECOME SENIORS BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE IN THEY'RE IN A PROBL- THEY'RE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT REGENTS EXAM  (fe_03_07953-A-0024)
IT IS TERRIBLE AND SO THAT'S THAT CREATED A LOT OF PROBLEMS THIS YEAR  (fe_03_07953-A-0025)
THEY DON'T GET AROUND IT WHEN THEY'RE IN NEW YORK THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT IT'S UM  (fe_03_07953-A-0027)
YOU KNOW IT THERE THERE AND I THINK THAT [MN] WHAT WHAT THE PROBLEM I SEE IS HAPPENING IS THAT THEY ARE PUTTING THE STUDENTS INTO A BOX  (fe_03_07953-A-0028)
THEY'RE PUTTING IN THEY'RE THEY'RE SAYING THAT ALL STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS ALL STUDENTS ARE AT THIS LEVEL AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY AS WE KNOW NOW THAT'S NOT THE WAY PEOPLE ARE [NOISE]  (fe_03_07953-A-0029)
DIFFERENT WAYS AND [SIGH] YOU KNOW EACH STUDENT IS DIFFERENT EACH STUDENT HAS THEIR OWN STRENGTHS AND ABILITIES  (fe_03_07953-A-0030)
SO UM YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A REAL [MN] [MN] SO I SEE THAT AS A REAL PROBLEM THE SOLUTION IS I THINK THAT THEY NEED FIRST OF ALL TO GET RID OF THOSE KINDS OF TESTS  (fe_03_07953-A-0031)
AND UH ALSO IF THEY DECIDE TO DO THAT KIND OF A THING THEN I THINK THEY NEED TO MAKE IT  (fe_03_07953-A-0032)
MORE DOWN TO EARTH AND AND TRY TO MAKE IT UM [SIGH] UH YOU KNOW DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THOSE KINDS OF TESTS AND NOT JUST HAVE ONE TEST THAT EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED EXPECTED TO PASS AND EXPECTED TO DO WELL IN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07953-A-0033)
