NICE TO MEET YOU [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07962-A-0003)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_07962-A-0007)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07962-A-0008)
BUT DO YOU DO YOU NECESSARILY THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S WRONG WITH THE SCHOOL OR THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S WRONG WITH THE THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM NOT GIVING THE SCHOOLS ENOUGH MONEY  (fe_03_07962-A-0009)
RIGHT RIGHT BUT A LOT OF TIMES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS YOU'RE GOING TO FIND YOU CAN FIND BETTER QUALITY TEACHERS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE TEACHERS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS OFTEN ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANT TO BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID ANY MONEY BASICALLY  (fe_03_07962-A-0010)
VERSUS THE TEACHERS IN UM PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE GETTING PAID NORMALLY YOU KNOW A PRETTY HEFTY SALARY AND YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO GET A TEACHER WHO'S REALLY ENTHUSED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_07962-A-0011)
SO  (fe_03_07962-A-0012)
MHM  (fe_03_07962-A-0013)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07962-A-0015)
MHM GOING TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07962-A-0016)
OKAY SO WHAT DO YOU FEEL THEN ABOUT THE THE VOUCHER SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE STARTING TO GIVE OUT FOR UM PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO START ATTENDING THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE WAY TO GO THEN  (fe_03_07962-A-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07962-A-0019)
WELL AND AND I AGREE WITH YOU THERE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE SEEN HAPPEN MOST OFTEN IS THAT WHENEVER A DISTRICT TRIES TO  (fe_03_07962-A-0020)
ENACT SOME SORT OF SMALL LIKE A POINT FIVE PERCENT TAX IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS MOST OF THE TIME THEY GET VOTED DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PAY THAT EXTRA POINT FIVE PERCENT  (fe_03_07962-A-0021)
SO YOU'RE RUNNING INTO THE SITUATION WHERE YEAH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS NEED SOME NEED SOME WORK AND IT'S M- YOU KNOW NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME BECAUSE OF MONEY BUT THE COMMUNITY'S NOT WILLING TO PUT THE MONEY INTO IT  (fe_03_07962-A-0022)
SO YOU KIND OF HAVE A VICIOUS CIRCLE I MEAN W- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO IMPROVE SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY COMPLAINS ABOUT BUT THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO PAY FOR  (fe_03_07962-A-0023)

SOME OF LIKE SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT THEY DO HIRE UM THEY ARE LIKE YOU SAID THEY'RE BITTER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE MONEY AND AH REALLY HAVE NO PLACE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN  (fe_03_07962-A-0034)
