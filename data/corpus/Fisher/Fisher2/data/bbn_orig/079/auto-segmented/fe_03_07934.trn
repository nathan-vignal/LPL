NO NO THESE PEOPLE NO THEY WOULDN'T BE GOING ON TO TO FURTHER EDUCATION I MEAN THEY'RE JUST  (fe_03_07934-A-0022)
YOU KNOW TH- THE REASON THAT PEOPLE [MN] DON'T DO WELL IS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED AND THEY CERTAINLY WOULDN'T SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO MORE YEARS IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_07934-A-0023)
[LIPSMACK] OH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN UM  (fe_03_07934-A-0024)
I WAS PUT IN A LOT OF THE HONORS CLASSES AND THE ADVANCED CLASSES BUT I HAD TEACHERS WHO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME  (fe_03_07934-A-0025)
UM [MN] YOU KNOW I I HAD A GEOGRAPHY TEACHER WHO BROUGHT ME UM XEROXES OF MAPS AND LET ME COLOR THEM  (fe_03_07934-A-0026)
BECAUSE I ALREADY KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE TEXTBOOK YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TEACH TOWARDS THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR WHICH IS PEOPLE WHO REALLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THEY'RE SIMPLY N- YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07934-A-0027)
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO OUT HERE WHO JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INTELLECT AND [MN] UNFORTUNATELY THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE WAY THEY'RE SET UP HAVE TO TEACH TOWARDS THOSE PEOPLE  (fe_03_07934-A-0028)
AND ANYONE WHO IS AT AVERAGE OR BETTER  (fe_03_07934-A-0029)
UNDERSTANDING UM YOU KNOW IS IS BORED OUT OF THEIR MINDS A- ANOTHER TEACHER THAT I HAD  (fe_03_07934-A-0030)
UM ACTUALLY HAD ME GRADING THE EXAMS THAT SHE'D GIVEN TO PEOPLE TWO GRADES ABOVE ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07934-A-0031)
I'D ALREADY READ MORE BOOKS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE CLASS AND YOU KNOW EITHER THAT OR SHE PASSES TO GO TO THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_07934-A-0032)
YOU KNOW SO  (fe_03_07934-A-0033)
OH ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_07934-A-0034)
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I I DIDN'T GET [LAUGHTER] I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF SCHOOL I MEAN EVERYTHING THAT I'VE LEARNED I HAVE SELF TAUGHT  (fe_03_07934-A-0035)
IT I HAVE UM ATTENDED COLLEGE TWO DIFFERENT ONES ACTUALLY BUT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A DEGREE I THINK THAT ALSO THAT WAS PART OF OF NOT REALLY GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOL I NEVER REALLY  (fe_03_07934-A-0036)
UM [MN] DEVELOPED AN INTEREST IN ANY PARTICULAR SUBJECT AND SO NOW I'M IN COLLEGE AND GOING OKAY WELL WHAT SHOULD I GET A MAJOR IN I'VE GOT  (fe_03_07934-A-0037)
YOU KNOW I'VE GOT BASICALLY FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE BUT NO MAJOR BECAUSE I JUST KEEP TRYING THINGS AND TRYING THINGS AND HOPING THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WILL INTEREST ME ENOUGH TO  (fe_03_07934-A-0038)
YOU KNOW TO WANNA GET A MAJOR IN IT BUT YOU KNOW IN HIGH SCHOOL I CERTAINLY HAD NO UM Y- YOU KNOW REAL INTEREST IN ANY ONE THING BECAUSE AGAIN THERE WASN'T ANYTHING INTERESTING ABOUT IT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07934-A-0039)
OH NO THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT HERE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07934-A-0040)
NOT NOT IN A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL MM MM  (fe_03_07934-A-0041)
UM I ACTUALLY TOOK SOMETHING LIKE THAT AT ONE OF THE COLLEGES THAT I ATTENDED  (fe_03_07934-A-0042)
UM JUST BECAUSE I WAS AGAIN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOME SORT OF A MAJOR AND UM IT WAS THE STRONG INTEREST TEST  (fe_03_07934-A-0043)
UM BUT I MEAN THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D BEEN EXPOSED TO ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND  (fe_03_07934-A-0044)
WOW  (fe_03_07934-A-0045)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07934-A-0046)
MHM  (fe_03_07934-A-0047)
[LIPSMACK] SO FOR THIRTEEN GRADES DOES THAT MEAN AN EXTRA YEAR AT THE BEGINNING OR THE END  (fe_03_07934-A-0048)
OKAY SO YOUR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL UNTIL THEY'RE NINETEEN OR DEAD  (fe_03_07934-A-0049)
MHM  (fe_03_07934-A-0050)
MHM  (fe_03_07934-A-0051)
THEY DO ACTUALLY UM I'VE BEEN TO PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE  (fe_03_07934-A-0052)
UM UNFORTUNATELY YOU SEE SOME OF THE SAME PROBLEMS IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07934-A-0053)
IT WELL IT IS TO SOME EXTENT BUT YOU'VE GOT  (fe_03_07934-A-0054)
YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT A HANDFUL OF BAD TEACHERS IN THE PRIVATE SYSTEM AS WELL UM I THINK THERE'S A A LARGER NUMBER OF BAD TEACHERS IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM BUT UM  (fe_03_07934-A-0055)
I SPENT MY MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS AT ONE OF THE BETTER PUBLIC ER PRIVATE SCHOOLS HERE IN ATLANTA AND UM DID REALLY REALLY WELL THERE ENJOYED MYSELF IMMENSELY  (fe_03_07934-A-0056)
YOU KNOW AND THE WAY THAT THEY WORK OR AT LEAST THIS ONE WORKED IS THAT YOU BASICALLY LEARNED AT YOUR OWN PACE SO IF YOU WERE IN THIRD GRADE AND WERE AT SEVENTH GRADE READING LEVEL OR WHATEVER THAT'S WHAT THEY GAVE YOU  (fe_03_07934-A-0057)
SO THAT WORKED REALLY WELL FOR ME BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAD AN OLDER BROTHER  (fe_03_07934-A-0058)
WHO HAD [SIGH] A LESS THAN WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AT THAT SCHOOL  (fe_03_07934-A-0059)
AND UM [MN] YOU KNOW I WAS YOUNG AT THE TIME MIDDLE SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW HE WAS OLDER AND MY PARENTS WANTED TO TAKE HIM OUT AND BECAUSE I WASN'T DRIVING THEY HAD TO TAKE ME OUT AS WELL SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T  (fe_03_07934-A-0060)
YOU KNOW GET US BOTH TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07934-A-0061)
EXACTLY SO  (fe_03_07934-A-0062)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_07934-A-0063)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK UM YOU KNOW IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN WHEN I HEARD THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TOPIC YOU KNOW AND WHAT CAN YOU DO TO IMPROVE IT  (fe_03_07934-A-0064)
I MEAN THE EDUCATION REFORMS THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS ARE JUST SO  (fe_03_07934-A-0065)
INCREDIBLY LARGE I MEAN IT'S HARD TO EVEN IMAGINE  (fe_03_07934-A-0066)
EXACTLY I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT THEY COULD DO IS DO THE VOUCHER SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL THEY USE  (fe_03_07934-A-0068)
YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC SCHOOL HERE IS PAID FOR VIA PROPERTY TAXES OR WHATEVER AND UM  (fe_03_07934-A-0069)
A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT STARTING A SYSTEM WHERE YOU GET A VOUCHER FOR THE AMOUNT THAT YOUR PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION IS COSTING AND YOU TAKE THE VOUCHER TO A PRIVATE INSTITUTION  (fe_03_07934-A-0070)
AND THE REASON THAT THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO ME IS BECAUSE  (fe_03_07934-A-0071)
[NOISE] YOU KNOW IT'S MORE OF A IT'S MORE OF A LIKE A MARKET ECONOMY THAT WAY YOU KNOW BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_07934-A-0072)
IF IF IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL IF YOU'RE PAYING  (fe_03_07934-A-0073)
YOU KNOW NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR MORE WHICH IS VERY LIKELY HERE UM YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT TEACHERS WHO ARE  (fe_03_07934-A-0074)
YOU KNOW INADEQUATE  (fe_03_07934-A-0075)
Y- THE PARENTS WILL COMPLAIN AND AND THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE REPLACED SIMPLY BECAUSE  (fe_03_07934-A-0076)
EXACTLY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07934-A-0077)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07934-A-0078)
EXACTLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY WITH YOUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEY'RE TAKING THAT MONEY FROM YOU REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU EVEN HAVE A STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYONE  (fe_03_07934-A-0079)
AND SO THAT THAT WOULD BE I THINK MY BIG FIRST STEP WOULD BE TO TO INSTITUTE THIS VOUCHER SYSTEM BECAUSE THEN WHEN EVERYONE'S TAKING THEIR KIDS OUT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07934-A-0080)
THEY'LL FINALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEY'LL SEE THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE THAT IT'S IN THAT  (fe_03_07934-A-0081)
THERE'S REALLY NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO START MAKING REFORMS INTERNALLY  (fe_03_07934-A-0082)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_07934-A-0083)
HI EMILY I'M JANE HUDDLE I'M IN KITCHENER ONTARIO SO I'M NOT IN UNITED STATES WHERE ARE YOU  (fe_03_07934-B-0001)

[SIGH] DO YOU HAVE KIDS IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_07934-B-0015)
OH Y-  (fe_03_07934-B-0016)
SURE I BET WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SYSTEMS BETWEEN CANADA AND UNITED STATES  (fe_03_07934-B-0017)

BUT EMILY WOULD THEY GO ON THEN LIKE YOU HAVE COLLEGE WE HAVE UNIVERS- WE HAVE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE WOULD THEY GO ON  (fe_03_07934-B-0020)
THAT WOULD BE THE END  (fe_03_07934-B-0021)
NO [SIGH] BUT IS IT THE TEACHING SYSTEM THAT FORCES THEM NOT TO BE INTERESTED  (fe_03_07934-B-0022)
AH  (fe_03_07934-B-0023)
YEP  (fe_03_07934-B-0026)
YEAH  (fe_03_07934-B-0029)
SO YOU'RE DEFEATED TOO  (fe_03_07934-B-0030)
I MEAN Y- YA Y- YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING OFFERED TO YOU ON YOUR LEVEL  (fe_03_07934-B-0031)
AND DID YOU GO ON THEN HAVE YOU GONE INTO COLLEGE AND THINGS  (fe_03_07934-B-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_07934-B-0033)
OH  (fe_03_07934-B-0034)
OH  (fe_03_07934-B-0035)
NO  (fe_03_07934-B-0036)
SO YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH OF A GUIDANCE DEPARTMENT LIKE WE DO HERE  (fe_03_07934-B-0037)
AND DO YOU TAKE TE- YOU DON'T TAKE TAKE TESTS TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR  (fe_03_07934-B-0038)
INTERESTS ARE LIKE THEY'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF TESTS HERE THE KIDS TAKE AND IT DETERMINES [MN]  (fe_03_07934-B-0039)
OR [MN] WHERE THEIR INTEREST IS  (fe_03_07934-B-0040)
GOSH  (fe_03_07934-B-0041)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07934-B-0042)
YEAH  (fe_03_07934-B-0043)
SEE OUR KIDS ARE EXPOSED TO THAT BY GRADE NINE WHICH WAS ABOUT FIF- IT'D BE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND THEY'VE JUST NOW CONVERTED FROM A GRADE THIRTEEN SYSTEM TO THE GRADE TWELVE SYSTEM THIS IS IN  (fe_03_07934-B-0044)
-TARIO OTHER PROVINCES HAVE BEEN GRADE TWELVE FOR YEARS BUT THEY'VE JUST CONVERTED OVER BUT OUR KIDS HAVE A LOT OF GUIDANCE  (fe_03_07934-B-0045)
[NOISE] THE END  (fe_03_07934-B-0046)
UM WELL YEAH I NOW IT WOULD BE EIGHTEEN AND THEN YOU'D GO ON TO EITHER COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY  (fe_03_07934-B-0047)
THAT KIND OF THING NOW WHAT ABOUT PUBLIC ER NOT PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT WHAT ABOUT PRIVATE SCHOOL DO A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07934-B-0048)
IT'S NOT ANY BETTER  (fe_03_07934-B-0049)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07934-B-0050)
OKAY  (fe_03_07934-B-0051)
