SO I GUESS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOLS [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07961-A-0003)

WELL THE COUNTY THAT WE LIVE IN HAS EXCELLENT PUBLIC SCHOOLS UM WE'RE IN TENNESSEE AND UM I  (fe_03_07961-A-0005)
MEAN I HAVE A A TWO YEAR OLD SO WE'RE NOT IN THE THE SYSTEM YET BUT I MEAN I THINK I THINK THAT M- MAYBE  (fe_03_07961-A-0006)
OVERALL THERE MAYBE POCKETS OF PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY  (fe_03_07961-A-0007)
BUT I THINK THAT IF THE PARENTS GET INVOLVED MORE  (fe_03_07961-A-0008)
I THINK THAT'S THE WHOLE ISSUE THAT PARENTS JUST AREN'T INVOLVED WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07961-A-0009)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0010)
REALLY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07961-A-0012)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0013)
[NOISE] WERE THE CLASSES SMALLER OR LARGER  (fe_03_07961-A-0014)
'CAUSE I I DID GO TO PUBLIC S- I MEAN I WENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE IN LOUISIANA AND SO I DIDN'T REALLY EXPERIENCE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STARTING  (fe_03_07961-A-0015)
YOU KNOW I KNOW  (fe_03_07961-A-0016)
I HAD FRIENDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL AND AND JUST THE WAY THEY TALKED IT WAS ALMOST LIKE  (fe_03_07961-A-0017)
THE TEACHERS DIDN'T HAVE CONTROL OF  (fe_03_07961-A-0018)
OF ANYTHING [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07961-A-0019)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0020)
YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY BIBLE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07961-A-0021)
MHM AND THAT MIGHT BE I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD SAY THAT ON THIS LINE BUT THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER THING THAT'S KIND OF WRONG WITH IT  (fe_03_07961-A-0022)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0023)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07961-A-0025)
AND IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW GOING INTO HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE I MEAN  (fe_03_07961-A-0026)
WE COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING  (fe_03_07961-A-0027)
IN MY PRIVATE SCHOOL EVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL SO  (fe_03_07961-A-0028)
YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT IS A GOOD POINT 'CAUSE I DO THINK THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT I MEAN  (fe_03_07961-A-0029)
BUT I THINK TOO AND I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT DISTRICT YOU WERE IN FOR HIGH SCHOOL BUT I THINK YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07961-A-0030)
FORTUNATELY THE COUNTY THAT WE ARE IN NOW IS THE RICHEST COUNTY IN TENNESSEE  (fe_03_07961-A-0031)
SO THEY DUMP A LOT OF MONEY INTO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07961-A-0032)
BUT I I MEAN WE HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T HAD FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH IT HERE  (fe_03_07961-A-0033)
THIS IS JUST HEARSAY BUT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THIS COUNTY  (fe_03_07961-A-0034)
SO WE'RE ASSUMING THAT IT'S A LITTLE BETTER BUT I THINK YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THAT CONTROL ISSUE WHERE THE TEACHERS JUST DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL  (fe_03_07961-A-0035)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0037)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0039)

MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0045)
GOSH  (fe_03_07961-A-0046)

[LAUGHTER] EXACTLY  (fe_03_07961-A-0050)
[LAUGHTER] EVERYTHING LOOKS DIFFERENTLY ON THE OUTSIDE  (fe_03_07961-A-0051)
NOW I'VE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TEACHERS THAT IT'S JUST A A JOB FOR THEM THEY DON'T CARE IF THE KIDS LEARN ANYTHING THEY DON'T CARE IF BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THAT IN PUB- IN PRIVATE SCHOOL TOO  (fe_03_07961-A-0052)
SO I MEAN I THINK BUT I DO THINK THAT  (fe_03_07961-A-0053)
THE TEACHERS  (fe_03_07961-A-0054)
I- IF IF THERE'S SO MANY KIDS THAT  (fe_03_07961-A-0055)
THE TEACHERS JUST DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER SO IT MAKES IT HARD FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TO LEARN IN THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT  (fe_03_07961-A-0056)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0057)
SO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT IT'S A PUBLIC SCHOOL THING BUT  (fe_03_07961-A-0058)
I MEAN I THINK AT LEAST IN PRIVATE SCHOOL THE FAM- THE PARENTS ARE DUMPING SO MUCH MONEY INTO IT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PAY YOUR TUITION  (fe_03_07961-A-0059)
AND SO THE TEACHERS ALMOST HAVE TO  (fe_03_07961-A-0060)
HAVE CONTROL OR THE THE PARENTS WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON  (fe_03_07961-A-0061)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07961-A-0062)
AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO THE SCHOOL BOARD SO I GUESS IN THAT SENSE THE PARENTS ARE MORE INVOLVED IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING  (fe_03_07961-A-0063)
THAT CHECK EVERY MONTH OR EVERY YEAR BUT THEN IN PUBLIC SCHOOL IT'S KIND OF LIKE WELL IT'S JUST TAXPAYER MONEY YOU KNOW IT'S NO BIG DEAL  (fe_03_07961-A-0064)
SO I DO I THINK A LOT OF IT IS DOES FALL BACK ON THE PARENTS  (fe_03_07961-A-0065)
I MEAN  (fe_03_07961-A-0066)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT WE ELECT FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THE THE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07961-A-0067)
SO IT IS IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY I THINK  (fe_03_07961-A-0068)
UM  (fe_03_07961-A-0069)
AND I PROBABLY ONLY THINK THIS WAY BECAUSE I NOW HAVE A CHILD [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07961-A-0070)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0071)
IF YOU DIDN'T RESPECT YOUR MOM AND DAD AT HOME  (fe_03_07961-A-0072)
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RESPECT THE TEACHERS AND THEN THE TEACHERS CAN'T DO THEIR JOB  (fe_03_07961-A-0073)
SO THEN THEY DON'T WANT TO TEACH IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07961-A-0074)
MHM  (fe_03_07961-A-0075)
