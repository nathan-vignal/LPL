MHM  (fe_03_07966-A-0085)
IN NEW YORK THERE SEEMS TO BE AN EXCESS OF TEACHERS  (fe_03_07966-A-0086)
YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF TEACHING COLLEGES IN NEW YORK AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF IT  (fe_03_07966-A-0087)

I I KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT THAT FROM WHEN I WAS TEACHING I WE ONLY DID AN ATTEND - OH NOT ATTENDANCE AN ACHIEVEMENT TEST AT THE END OF THE YEAR  (fe_03_07966-B-0072)
TEACHING FIRST GRADERS THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PANIC [LAUGHTER] IN THE ROOM ABOUT THAT SO WE WERE KIND OF TOLD TO TEACH THE TEST  (fe_03_07966-B-0073)

AND TEACHING IS TIRING ANYWAY AND TO HAVE TO DO THAT ON TOP OF IT  (fe_03_07966-B-0082)
I CAN SEE WHY SO MANY TEACHERS LEAVE THE SYSTEM IN THIS STATE  (fe_03_07966-B-0083)
AH A LOT OF PARTS OF THE STATE NOT CHARLOTTE BUT A LOT OF THEM THERE IS A HUGE TEACHER SHORTAGE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY SO MANY TEACHERS HAVE JUST BEEN FORCED OUT BY THE SYSTEM PUSHING THEM  (fe_03_07966-B-0084)
YOU DIDN'T GO INTO EDUCATION  (fe_03_07966-B-0085)
TO DO PAPERWORK YOU WENT INTO EDUCATION TO TEACH  (fe_03_07966-B-0086)
I I THINK TEACHERS ARE BORN AND I IMAGINE YOUR DAUGHTER'S THE SAME WAY YOU JUST YOU HAVE A HEART FOR IT AND YOU DON'T GO INTO EDUCATION UNLESS YOU HAVE THAT HEART FOR IT NOT THAT IT'S A BIG CROWN ON YOUR HEAD THAT OOH I'M A TEACHER BUT  (fe_03_07966-B-0088)
