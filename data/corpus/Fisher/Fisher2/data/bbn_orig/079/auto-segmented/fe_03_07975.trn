I THINK WE PROBABLY HEARD THE SAME THING JUST IS IT A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_07975-B-0011)
[NOISE] I THINK AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MEANS THAT YOU PICK WHO YOU'RE GOING TO HIRE BASED ON THINGS LIKE WHAT RACE THEY ARE  (fe_03_07975-B-0012)
CAN BE I THINK I THINK IT'S  (fe_03_07975-B-0014)
I THINK IT STARTED BACK WHEN LIKE TOO MANY NON WHITES WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING WORK AND THEY MADE SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE LIKE QUOTAS  (fe_03_07975-B-0015)
WHERE LIKE SUCH AND SUCH PERCENT OF YOUR WORKFORCE WOULD HAVE TO BE A MINORITY  (fe_03_07975-B-0016)
BUT I I THINK [MN] WE'VE KINDA GROWN PAST THAT I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT A POINT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO FORCE EMPLOYERS TO PICK PEOPLE BASED ON RACE QUOTAS  (fe_03_07975-B-0017)
YEAH  (fe_03_07975-B-0018)
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE IF YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE BOTH GOOD AT COMPUTERS AND ONE OF THEM'S BLACK AND ONE OF THEM'S WHITE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MEANS YOU AUTOMATICALLY PICK THE BLACK ONE  (fe_03_07975-B-0019)
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE SO MANY BLACK WORKERS YOU KNOW PERCENTAGE WISE OUT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE OVERALL [NOISE]  (fe_03_07975-B-0020)
WELL THE OLD RULES FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SAID THAT THE BLACK GUYS GOT THE JOB ANYWAY THEY HAD ACTUALLY HIRED MINORITIES ABOVE PEOPLE WHO WERE MORE QUALIFIED OR HAD MORE EXPERIENCE  (fe_03_07975-B-0021)
YEAH  (fe_03_07975-B-0022)
AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANT THAT THE EMPLOYER ACTUALLY ENDED UP WITH A LESS QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE  (fe_03_07975-B-0023)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07975-B-0024)
EXACTLY I MEAN THAT CAN DRAG YOUR WHOLE BUSINESS DOWN I THINK THEY NEED TO HIRE WHOEVER'S MOST QUALIFIED  (fe_03_07975-B-0025)
YEAH  (fe_03_07975-B-0026)
I THINK THEY SHOULD JUST HIRE WHOEVER'S MOST QUALIFIED [SIGH]  (fe_03_07975-B-0027)

YEAH WELL THAT'S PART OF BEING QUALIFIED IS BEING A GOOD WORKER BEING THERE ON TIME MHM  (fe_03_07975-B-0029)
YEAH I THINK THOSE KIND OF QUALIFICATIONS IT WOULDN'T MATTER AT ALL WHAT COLOR OR WHAT RACE THE PERSON WAS  (fe_03_07975-B-0030)
YEAH YEAH AND I THINK THAT IS MORE ABOUT THE FAMILIES I DON'T THINK THEY'RE NECESSARILY HIRING THEIR OWN RACE I THINK THEY'RE HIRING THEIR RELATIVES [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07975-B-0032)
YEAH MHM HM I DO A LOT OF MY WORK OVER THE INTERNET AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT IT IS I KNOW THAT IT'S A TOTALLY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD  (fe_03_07975-B-0033)
