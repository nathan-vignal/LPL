PARDON ME  (fe_03_07985-B-0016)

WELL I'M AGAINST IT  (fe_03_07985-B-0023)
I'M AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AT THE WORKPLACE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY  (fe_03_07985-B-0024)
WHERE WHERE I WAS BOR- I'M A I'M A MINORITY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE I WAS BROUGHT UP IS THAT YOU WORK I MEAN IF YOU BUST YOUR BUTT AND YOU WORK LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK EVERYTHING WILL FALL IN LINE AND TAKE CARE OF ITSELF  (fe_03_07985-B-0025)
I DON'T BELIEVE IN HANDING OUT SPECIAL FAVORS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN  (fe_03_07985-B-0026)
OR SO FORTH AND SO ON I'M ENTIRELY AGAINST THAT I BELIEVE IN THE OLD WORK ETHIC IF YOU WORK HARD ENOUGH AND YOU YOU DO YOUR JOB EVERYTHING WILL COME TO YOU LIKE IT SHOULD AND IF IT DOESN'T WELL YOU GO LOOK FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE  (fe_03_07985-B-0027)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07985-B-0028)
WELL THINK THINK OF IT THINK OF IT THE OTHER WAY [MN] TAKE THE OTHER POINT I AND I AGREE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A WELL SAY UM A VICE PRESIDENT'S JOB HAS OPENED UP IN THE COMPANY OKAY  (fe_03_07985-B-0029)
AND YOU HAVE YOU HAVE LIKE SAY EIGHT DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO PUT IN FOR THE POSITION WHO WORK THERE AND THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND THEY WORK VERY VERY HARD FOR THEIR BOSS SO THEY CAN PUT IN FOR THAT VICE PRESIDENT JOB  (fe_03_07985-B-0030)
NOW INSTEAD OF THE PEOPLE AT THE WORKPLACE GETTING IT THEY'LL GO OUTSIDE BECAUSE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE SO MANY BLACKS SO MANY LATINOS AND SO MANY HISPANICS  (fe_03_07985-B-0031)
AND THEN THEY'LL GO OUTSIDE AND PICK SOMEONE OUT OF THAT GROUP IN ORDER TO BE IN THAT POSITION OF THE VICE PRESIDENT I THINK THAT'S WRONG BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE THERE WHO ARE ESTABLISHED THEY'VE WORKED HARD THEY'VE BEEN LOYAL  (fe_03_07985-B-0032)
THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB THEY'RE EXCELLENT EMPLOYEES BUT THEY DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG  (fe_03_07985-B-0033)
IF YOU LIKE I SAID IF YOU WORK HARD I THINK HE OR SHE SHOULD GET THAT POSITION AND I DO BELIEVE THAT STRONGLY INSTEAD OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION I  (fe_03_07985-B-0034)
I DISAGREE WITH THAT I REALLY DO  (fe_03_07985-B-0035)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07985-B-0036)
UH YES YOU'RE RIGHT BUT LIKE A LIKE LIKE LI- I LOOK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP THE STUDENTS WHAT ABOUT THE STUDENT WHO WHO'S GONE TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_07985-B-0037)
AND STAYS AFTER SCHOOL AT THE LIBRARY AND STUDIES REAL HARD PASSES ALL THE TESTS  (fe_03_07985-B-0038)
IS A GOOD STUDENT AT HOME UM ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS AT SCHOOL AND DOESN'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE  (fe_03_07985-B-0039)
BECAUSE ANOTHER BECAUSE OF AN- MINORITY TOOK HIS PLACE INSTEAD OF HIM TAKING THE PLACE BECAUSE HE EARNED IT HE HAD GOOD SCORES AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND HE'S LEFT OUT IN THE COLD IS THAT RIGHT  (fe_03_07985-B-0040)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07985-B-0041)
TRUE  (fe_03_07985-B-0043)
TRUE  (fe_03_07985-B-0044)
YEAH I I AGREE WITH YOU BU- YOU KNOW BUT THERE'S ONE MORE PROBLEM WE HAVE AND THAT'S IF IF IF CERTAIN COMPANIES THEY'RE LIKE CE- FOR INSTANCE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES  (fe_03_07985-B-0045)
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROPER MIX OF WHITE AND BLACK HISPANIC AND LA- AND LATINO  (fe_03_07985-B-0046)
THE GOVERNMENT WITH WITHHOLD MONIES AND THE STATE WILL WITHHOLD MONEY TO THAT CERTAIN COMPANY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A MIX RACE  (fe_03_07985-B-0047)
IN THE WORKPLACE IS THAT RIGHT  (fe_03_07985-B-0048)
I DON'T THINK IT IS  (fe_03_07985-B-0049)
YOU KNOW AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT Y- WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS ALSO CORRECT YOU'RE ALSO YOU ALSO HAVE A GOOD POINT SO SO WHAT DO WE DO WHERE WHERE DO WE MAKE IT FAIR HOW DO WE MAKE IT FAIR  (fe_03_07985-B-0050)
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION  (fe_03_07985-B-0051)
WELL IT I- IT IT IT DOES BECAUSE IT IT BRINGS OUT THE PROBLEM AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS I'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_07985-B-0052)
BUT I KNOW THERE'S GOTTA BE A SOLUTION OUT THERE EVERY PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE THERE'S THERE IS A SOLUTION  (fe_03_07985-B-0053)
I MEAN  (fe_03_07985-B-0054)
WE HAVE TO FIND IT WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER AS PEOPLE AND FIND THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS THING ABOUT HAVING EQUAL RACES IN THE WORKPLACE I'M ALL FOR IT AND I THINK IT'S GREAT  (fe_03_07985-B-0055)
AND I'VE BEEN IN SOME INSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE THAT THAT ARE OF THE MIXED RACE THAT COME INTO THE WORKPLACE  (fe_03_07985-B-0056)
AND I'M NOT PICKING ANYBODY BUT A LOT OF THE TIMES YOU FIND OUT THAT S- PARTICULAR PERSON CAN'T DO THE JOB  (fe_03_07985-B-0057)
AND THE ONLY ONE REASON WHY THEY'RE THERE IS BECAUSE THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN  (fe_03_07985-B-0058)
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_07985-B-0059)
BUT YET THEY HIRE THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A QUOTA AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS THE WORD QUOTA YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF RACES  (fe_03_07985-B-0060)
I DON'T THINK THE QUOTA'S RIGHT EITHER I AGREE WITH IT TO A CERTAIN A POINT BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THE WORD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE LIKE I SAY I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT UM  (fe_03_07985-B-0061)
I MEAN LOOK AT WOMEN HOW THEY WERE DISCRIMINATED FOR LOTS OF YEARS  (fe_03_07985-B-0062)
WOMEN WEREN'T ALLOWED TO VOTE OR THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS BUT WITH EQUAL RI- THEY WANT IN WOMEN THEY WANT EQUAL WORK FOR EQUAL PAY  (fe_03_07985-B-0063)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07985-B-0064)
THAT I- I'M ALL FOR THAT A HUNDRED PERCENT BEHIND THAT BUT ONCE AGAIN  (fe_03_07985-B-0065)
IF IF A MALE CAN DO THE JOB BETTER THAN THE FEMALE AND YET AT EQUAL RATES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON I PERSONALLY NOW WITHOUT BEING PREJUDICED I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE MALE  (fe_03_07985-B-0066)
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE CAN DO THE JOB  (fe_03_07985-B-0067)
AND HE'LL HE'LL GET THE PRODUCTION DONE  (fe_03_07985-B-0068)
TRUE  (fe_03_07985-B-0069)
OH NO NO NO BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF IT WERE A PARTICULAR LET'S SAY A PARTICULAR COMPUTER JOB  (fe_03_07985-B-0070)
AND THAT PERSON OR THE MALE PERSON OR WHOEVER IT IS  (fe_03_07985-B-0071)
THE- THEY KNOW THAT THEY KNOW THE JOB AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN GET THE JOB DONE  (fe_03_07985-B-0072)
BUT INSTEAD YOU BRING OUT SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE TO COME IN AND DO THAT JOB  (fe_03_07985-B-0073)
AND USUALLY THEY FALL ON THEIR FACE  (fe_03_07985-B-0074)
UNFORTUNATELY  (fe_03_07985-B-0075)
