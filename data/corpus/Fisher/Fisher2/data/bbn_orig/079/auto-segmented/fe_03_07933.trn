YEAH  (fe_03_07933-A-0099)
HI MY NAME IS RHONDA  (fe_03_07933-B-0001)
UM I THINK THERE'S A EXTREMELY BIG PROBLEM WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07933-B-0002)
UM IN MY OPINION PART OF THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THE THE TEACHERS DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH MONEY  (fe_03_07933-B-0003)
OH I HEAR YOU HAVE A LITTLE ONE  (fe_03_07933-B-0004)
I SAID I CAN HEAR YOU HAVE A LITTLE CHILD IN THE BACKGROUND  (fe_03_07933-B-0005)
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_07933-B-0006)
WELL BOTH OF MINE GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT THEY GO TO A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL AND THAT WAS WHEN I 'CAUSE WE MOVED ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO  (fe_03_07933-B-0007)
AND WE SEARCHED DIFFERENT AREAS BEFORE WE MOVED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS GOOD BEFORE WE WOULD MOVE  (fe_03_07933-B-0008)
AND I ALSO SUBSTITUTE TEACH SO I KNOW WHAT THE THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE AND THERE'S A FEW SCHOOLS IN OUR SYSTEM THAT I WON'T ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO GO TO AND THAT'S  (fe_03_07933-B-0009)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE  (fe_03_07933-B-0010)
THE TEACHERS ARE FINE BUT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM ISN'T  (fe_03_07933-B-0011)
SET UP THE WAY I I LIKE  (fe_03_07933-B-0012)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07933-B-0013)
YEAH THE CLASSROOMS NEED TO BE SMALLER WE LIVE IN G-  (fe_03_07933-B-0014)
RIGHT WELL WE LIVE IN GEORGIA AND UH  (fe_03_07933-B-0015)
THE COUNTY WE LIVE IN MY KIDS GO TO THE COUNTY SCHOOL NOT THE CITY SCHOOL BECAUSE I WON'T ALLOW THAT UM  (fe_03_07933-B-0017)
THERE IS UH TWENTY NINE STUDENTS TO EVERY ONE TEACHER  (fe_03_07933-B-0018)
AND THAT  (fe_03_07933-B-0019)
IT'S STILL KIND OF A LARGE RATIO  (fe_03_07933-B-0020)
BUT THEY'VE GOT IT SET UP TO WHERE THEY CAN KEEP THINGS INTERESTING FOR THE KIDS  (fe_03_07933-B-0021)
BECAUSE THEY HAVE UM  (fe_03_07933-B-0022)
THEY HAVE TO TAKE TESTS AND WHERE THEY SCORE ON THE TESTS LIKE  (fe_03_07933-B-0023)
THE KIDS WHO ARE  (fe_03_07933-B-0024)
LIKE THE ADVANCED KIDS THEY'RE PLACED IN CLASSES TOGETHER AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE KIND OF  (fe_03_07933-B-0025)
MORE PLACED INSTEAD OF LIKE THE SLOWER KIDS BEING WITH THE MORE ADVANCED KIDS AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07933-B-0026)
CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR EVERYBODY  (fe_03_07933-B-0027)
RIGHT IT IT  (fe_03_07933-B-0028)

YEAH NOW THE SPECIAL ED- CLASSES THEY ARE SMALLER BUT THEY THE REGULAR  (fe_03_07933-B-0030)
THE REGULAR CLASSROOMS THEIR  (fe_03_07933-B-0031)
AVERAGE OF TWENTY NINE  (fe_03_07933-B-0032)
BUT I I MEAN I'VE SUBBED FOR  (fe_03_07933-B-0033)
THE SPECIAL ED CLASSES AND I'VE SUBBED IN YOU KNOW REGULAR CLASSES AND I'VE SUBBED AT THE UM  (fe_03_07933-B-0034)
THE ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07933-B-0035)
AND TRUTHFULLY THE ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL  (fe_03_07933-B-0036)
IS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE KIDS KNOW THAT IF THEY MESS UP TH-  (fe_03_07933-B-0037)
THEY GO TO JUVENILE YOU KNOW THEY GO TO JUVEE OR THEY GO TO JAIL  (fe_03_07933-B-0038)
DEPENDING ON HOW OLD THEY ARE  (fe_03_07933-B-0039)
AND THEY'RE SMALL AND THEY GET A LOT OF ONE ON ONE ATTENTION  (fe_03_07933-B-0040)
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW AND [MN] IT'S A BAD THING THAT THE KIDS HAVE TO MESS UP IN SCHOOL TO TO GET SENT THERE  (fe_03_07933-B-0041)
BUT THEY GET A BETTER EDUCATION WHEN THEY'RE THERE  (fe_03_07933-B-0042)

YEAH WELL WHEN WE MOVED HERE UM I STARTED SUBSTITUTE TEACHING  (fe_03_07933-B-0056)
AND MY KIDS WERE ALREADY GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND I FIGURED IF  (fe_03_07933-B-0057)
BECAUSE I HAD WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL WHERE WE LIVED AT IN ILLINOIS AND WE LIVED IN A TOWN OF ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE SO IT WAS A REALLY SMALL SCHOOL AND THE GRADE SCHOOL AND THE HIGH SCHOOL WAS ALL TOGETHER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07933-B-0058)
AND THEY WERE USED THAT WAS WHEN WE MOVED HERE THEY WERE IN A LARGE SCHOOL  (fe_03_07933-B-0059)
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE  (fe_03_07933-B-0060)
AND IT IS THE TEACHERS JUST DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH MONEY  (fe_03_07933-B-0061)
THE ADMINISTRATORS  (fe_03_07933-B-0062)
I HAVE YOU KNOW IN MY OPINION THE ADMINISTRATORS GET PAID MORE THAN THEY SHOULD FOR NO MORE THAN WHAT THEY DO  (fe_03_07933-B-0063)
THEY'RE NOT WITH THE KIDS HANDS ON DAY IN AND DAY OUT  (fe_03_07933-B-0064)
THEY MAKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SIT IN THEIR OFFICE AND TO WALK AROUND THE SCHOOL AND TRY TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE WHICH THEY DON'T DO  (fe_03_07933-B-0065)
MHM  (fe_03_07933-B-0066)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07933-B-0067)
SO THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE  (fe_03_07933-B-0068)

THEIR FAMILY THEIR FRIENDS MHM  (fe_03_07933-B-0070)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07933-B-0071)
