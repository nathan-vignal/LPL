HI I'M WENDY ROCKET  (fe_03_07947-A-0002)
[NOISE] HI THERE WELL DO YOU WANT TO START  (fe_03_07947-A-0003)
OKAY U- U- UM MY OPINION IS THAT THERE [SIGH] THERE'S ROOM FOR SOME IMPROVEMENT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT FOR THE MOST PART I THINK THEY'RE DOING A PRETTY G- GOOD JOB [SIGH] I THINK UM [SIGH] WHERE IT NEEDS TO START IS IN THE H- HOME [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0005)
WHERE PARENTS ARE EDUCATING THEIR KIDS MORE OR YOU KNOW [SIGH] MAKING THEM READ MORE [SIGH] THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP  (fe_03_07947-A-0006)
[LIPSMACK] AND STARTING THEM O- OFF A- AT AN EARLY AGE [SIGH] TRYING TO EDUCATE THEM THAT ALWAYS HELPS  (fe_03_07947-A-0007)
[SIGH] SO I THINK IT NEEDS TO START THERE [SIGH] AND ONCE THEY GET TO SCHOOL THEN YOU KNOW THEY'LL [NOISE] BE PREPARED BETTER PREPARED [SIGH] A- A- AND AH  (fe_03_07947-A-0008)
[LIPSMACK] A- AND FROM THERE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM I THINK THEY'LL HAVE AN EASIER TIME EDUCATING THE STUDENTS WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_07947-A-0009)
[NOISE] [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07947-A-0011)
I A- AGREE BUT UM [SIGH] I THINK THAT THE CASE IN WHICH STUDENTS WHO AREN'T ENGLISH SPEAKERS  (fe_03_07947-A-0012)
[SIGH] IS MORE OF A MINORITY AND IT'S  (fe_03_07947-A-0013)
AND IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE IN STATES LIKE IN SOUTH WESTERN STATES WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF SPANISH SPEAKERS  (fe_03_07947-A-0014)
[SIGH] BUT [SIGH] I KNOW THAT THEY DO OFFER PROGRAMS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0015)
IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS TODAY THE PUBLIC SCHOOL I WENT TO [SIGH] UM IT WAS IN E._L. PASO TEXAS WHICH IS RIGHT ALONG THE  (fe_03_07947-A-0016)
BOR- THE U._S. MEXICO BORDER SO WE HAD D- DEFINITELY [SIGH] A LARGE SHARE OF SPANISH SPEAKERS AND UM THEY PUT THEM IN THIS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAM SO THAT IT DIDN'T AH INT- INTERFERE WITH THE [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0017)
KNOWLEDGE OR LEARNING OF THE UM ENGLISH SPEAKERS IN THE CLASSES SO  (fe_03_07947-A-0018)
[MN] THEY WERE SEPARATED  (fe_03_07947-A-0019)
UM  (fe_03_07947-A-0020)
THEY THEY WERE IN THE SAME GRADE BUT THEY WERE IN THE ENGLISH  (fe_03_07947-A-0021)
[SIGH] UM NO THEY WERE IN THIS E._S._L. PROGRAM WHICH AH [SIGH] WHICH THEY STAY IN UNTIL THEIR UM ENGLISH SPEAKING ABILITIES WERE UP TO PAR SO THAT THEY COULD PARTICIPATE WITH THE UM [SIGH] STUDENTS IN THE REGULAR CLASSROOMS [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0022)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07947-A-0023)
WELL THAT'S ALL RELATIVE YOU CAN'T E- EXPECT THAT EVERY STUDENT IS AT THE SAME EDUCATION LEVEL  (fe_03_07947-A-0024)
BUT UM IN TERMS OF THEM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN  (fe_03_07947-A-0025)
MM BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_07947-A-0027)
[MN] THERE'S S- SOME THINGS THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN LEARN MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS U- U-  (fe_03_07947-A-0028)
UM  (fe_03_07947-A-0029)
WHEREAS IN OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT ENGLISH AND THAT SORT OF THING AND MATH IT SEEMS MATH IS TOUGH FOR MANY MANY MANY STUDENTS BUT I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH [SIGH] TO UM  (fe_03_07947-A-0031)
F- FOR IT TO BE EASIER FOR ME TO PICK UP ON MATH [SIGH] BUT IN MY HIGH SCHOOL AH MY E- EXPERIENCE WAS THAT MATH WAS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR AH PEOPLE AND WE USED TO HAVE TO TAKE WHAT THEY CALL A T- TASK TEST [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0032)
UM  (fe_03_07947-A-0033)
[MN] AND I WOULD ALWAYS HEAR OF PEOPLE PASSING EVERY PORTION BUT THE MATH PORTION [SIGH] WHICH A- AH I WAS QUITE SURPRISED ABOUT BECAUSE I WOULD JUST BREEZE THROUGH THE MATH PORTION IT WAS VERY EASY FOR ME [SIGH] SO  (fe_03_07947-A-0034)
MY POINT IS BEING [SIGH] IS THAT [SIGH] YES WE ALL TAKE THE SAME CLASSES BUT NEV- NOT EVERYONE GETS THE SAME THING OUT OF THE CLASS  (fe_03_07947-A-0035)
SO YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE  (fe_03_07947-A-0036)
HOWS HOW DO YOU MEAN  (fe_03_07947-A-0037)
WELL I IN MY EXPERIENCE IT WAS ALWAYS ENFORCED W- WE I MEAN THE STANDARD IS THEY THE TEACHERS GRADE SUPPOSEDLY ALL THE PAPERS  (fe_03_07947-A-0038)
A- ALL AH EQUALLY [SIGH] WITH THE WITH THE EQUAL STANDARDS APPLIED [SIGH] THEREFORE [SIGH] WHEN YOU GET YOUR GRADES AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER THEY AVERAGE THEM TOGETHER ACCORDING TO THEIR SCALE AND T- THAT THE GRADE THAT GET IS BASED ON [NOISE]  (fe_03_07947-A-0039)
THE GRADE YOU MADE THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR  (fe_03_07947-A-0040)
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I I'M NOT QUITE SURE THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY UM ARE TEACHERS THAT PROBABLY THEY'VE HAD THESE STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSES MAYBE M- [LAUGHTER] MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE [SIGH] THEREFORE THEY'RE TIRED OF 'EM SO THEY JUST PASS THEM  (fe_03_07947-A-0042)
[SIGH] SO THAT THEY CAN UM MOVE ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEM BACK IN THEIR CLASS TH- THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION OR PERHAPS [SIGH] IT DEPENDS WHEN PARENTS COMPLAIN YOU KNOW THEY CAN GET THEIR STUDENTS PUSHED ALONG TO THE NEXT GRADE EVEN THOUGH THE STUDENT ISN'T PREPARED [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0043)
OH DEFINITELY MORE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0044)
WELL BECAUSE PRIVATE SCHOOLS PARENTS PAY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE STUDENT [SIGH] THEREFORE THERE'S MORE INCENTIVE TO UM TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS YOU'RE FORCED TO GO AND MANY STUDENTS DON'T WANT TO BE THERE  (fe_03_07947-A-0045)
AND THE PARENTS YOU KNOW THEY DON'T  (fe_03_07947-A-0046)
S- SINCE IT'S NOT THEIR MONEY THAT'S PAYING FOR THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION [SIGH] THEY'RE TAKING LESS OF A ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE GETTING EDUCATED [SIGH] WHEREAS THE PRIVATE AH THE PARENTS OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOL KIDS [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0047)
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR THEIR KIDS ARE GETTING EDUCATED BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE STUDENTS' EDUCATION SO THEY WANT THE CHILD THE THE CHILD TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT IT'S OBVIOUSLY IMP- [SIGH] MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM  (fe_03_07947-A-0048)
NO [SIGH] UM I JUST DON'T THINK IT IT DEPEND- IT DEPENDS ON THE KID IT DEPENDS ON WH- [SIGH] IF THE KID WANTS TO BE THERE AND WHAT THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF IT [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0049)
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD'VE GOTTEN I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK I WOULD'VE GOTTEN A BETTER EDUCATION HAVING GONE TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL THAN A PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS MOTIVATED [SIGH] 'CAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0050)
BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE JUST FORCED TO GO THERE  (fe_03_07947-A-0051)
[SIGH] SO YES I THINK THEY THOSE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED BENEFITTED FROM A PRIVATE SCHOOL EDUCATION [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-A-0052)
YES  (fe_03_07947-A-0053)

[SIGH] AH I DITCHED A CLASS AND MY MOTHER GOT A C- CALL FROM THE POLICE SO T- THAT WAS PRETTY DISTURBING TO HER SO [SIGH] YOU KNOW THEY  (fe_03_07947-A-0059)
THEY EXPECT THAT WHEN YOU GET OFF AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY WHEN YOU GO TO COLLEGE AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR YOUR EDUCATION THAT  (fe_03_07947-A-0060)
[LIPSMACK] YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO PERSONALLY MOTIVATE YOURSELF  (fe_03_07947-A-0061)

[SIGH] [SIGH] WHY DON'T YOU START WENDY ROCKET [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-B-0003)
HOW CAN YOU EDUCATE STUDENTS WHEN THERE ISN'T A COMMON L- LANGUAGE THAT THEY USE [SIGH] WE'RE STICKING S- STUDENTS IN A CLASS WITH DIFFERENT L- LEVELS OF EDUCATION AND ENGLISH ABILITIES [SIGH] WE HAVE NON SPEAKING  (fe_03_07947-B-0004)
NON ENGLISH SPEAKING S- STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOLS [SIGH] WHERE THE TEACHERS ARE TAKING TAKING UP MORE OF THEIR TIME TO EDUCATE THEM [SIGH] [NOISE] AND L- LOSING TIME ON T- THE CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY DO WANT TO LEARN  (fe_03_07947-B-0005)
[SIGH] I BELIEVE THAT [SIGH] WE SHOULD STOP BUSSING STUDENTS IN FROM OTHER DISTRICTS INTO S- SCHOOLS [SIGH] AND WE SHOULD HAVE A DEGREE OF TESTING [SIGH] TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO ACTUALLY PASS [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-B-0006)
YES THERE IS A PASS FAIL RULE IN EFFECT [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-B-0007)
BUT IT'S NOT U- UPSTANDING AND PEOPLE GRADUATE WITHOUT LEARNING A DAMN THING  (fe_03_07947-B-0008)
WERE THEY IN THE SAME GRADE AS YOU THOUGH  (fe_03_07947-B-0009)
DID THEY PARTICIPATE I- IN THE SAME CLASSES THAT YOU DID  (fe_03_07947-B-0010)
SO ONCE THEIR ENGLISH SPEAKING  (fe_03_07947-B-0011)
A- A- AH ONCE THE ONCE THEIR LANGUAGE WAS UP TO PAR [SIGH] WAS THEIR EDUCATION ALSO UP TO THE SAME PAR AS WHAT YOU HAD  (fe_03_07947-B-0012)
WHY CAN'T YOU EXPECT THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE AT THE SAME EDUCATION LEVEL [SIGH] WE ALL TAKE THE SAME TESTS DON'T WE [MN] [NOISE]  (fe_03_07947-B-0013)
WELL I NEVER SAID EVERYBODY SHOULD GET THE SAME THING BUT EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A STANDARD WHAT THEY UPHOLD TO [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-B-0014)
WELL THERE SHOULD BE A MINIMUM STANDARD W- WHICH IS SET FOR PEOPLE TO PASS A CLASS AND THAT STANDARD IS NOT SET AND IS NOT ENFORCED [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-B-0015)
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN PEOPLE GRADUATING WITHOUT LEARNING TO READ  (fe_03_07947-B-0016)
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE THIS HAPPENS MORE IN P- PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS [SIGH]  (fe_03_07947-B-0017)
