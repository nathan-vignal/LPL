UM I HAVE A STEPSON THAT'S IN PUBLIC SCHOOL MY DAUGHTER IS ONLY THREE  (fe_03_07960-A-0003)
AND SHE DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE GOING TO PUBLIC [LAUGHTER] SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07960-A-0004)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07960-A-0005)
WAS IT A MONTESSORI SCHOOL  (fe_03_07960-A-0006)
I WOULD MUCH PREFER TO PUT MY DAUGHTER IN ONE OF THOSE THAN  (fe_03_07960-A-0007)
THAN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_07960-A-0008)
IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL HERE  (fe_03_07960-A-0009)
I'M NOT SURE UM MY SISTER PUT HER DAUGHTER IN IT FOR A WHILE  (fe_03_07960-A-0010)
AND I THINK SHE HAD FIFTEEN KIDS IN HER CLASS  (fe_03_07960-A-0011)
BUT MY STEPSON IS IN THE FIFTH GRADE AND HE HAD THIRTY KIDS IN HIS CLASS THIS YEAR  (fe_03_07960-A-0012)

YEAH  (fe_03_07960-A-0014)
OH MY GOODNESS [NOISE]  (fe_03_07960-A-0015)
YEAH I I THINK THAT SPORTS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT GIVES KIDS THE DISCIPLINE THAT THEY NEED  (fe_03_07960-A-0016)
AND TO CUT THAT OUT OF THE BUDGET'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS  (fe_03_07960-A-0017)
ALSO KEEPS THEM OUT OF TROUBLE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07960-A-0018)
YEAH  (fe_03_07960-A-0019)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07960-A-0020)
I ALSO DON'T AGREE WITH THE FIELD TRIPS THAT MY STEPSON WENT ON  (fe_03_07960-A-0021)
SOME OF 'EM WERE AS EXPENSIVE AS YOU KNOW FIFTEEN DOLLARS  (fe_03_07960-A-0022)
THIS IS PUBLIC SCHOOL IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FREE YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07960-A-0023)
