HI  (fe_03_07938-A-0001)
HI ALICE THIS IS KERRY  (fe_03_07938-A-0002)
IN NORTH FLORIDA I'M OUT IN COLORADO  (fe_03_07938-A-0003)
UM I'M NOT REAL FAMILIAR WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS OUT HERE ACTUALLY BECAUSE I TAUGHT IN UM PRIVATE SCHOOL OUT HERE AND MY CHILDREN ARE TOO YOUNG FOR  (fe_03_07938-A-0004)
FOR SCHOOL I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL MYSELF IN FLORIDA AND I TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL IN NORTH CAROLINA  (fe_03_07938-A-0005)
OKAY  (fe_03_07938-A-0006)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THOUGH REALLY WITH WITH THE SCHOOLS IS PARENT INVOLVEMENT  (fe_03_07938-A-0007)
MORE THAN ANYTHING  (fe_03_07938-A-0008)
AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY PRIVATE SCHOOLS DO SO WELL IS BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE VERY INVOLVED  (fe_03_07938-A-0009)
OH MY GOODNESS [MN]  (fe_03_07938-A-0010)
SO IS IT A PRIVATE SCHOOL SHE DRIVES  (fe_03_07938-A-0011)
YEAH  (fe_03_07938-A-0012)
YEAH  (fe_03_07938-A-0014)
YEAH  (fe_03_07938-A-0015)
WELL WHAT ARE THEY DOING ABOUT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEN  (fe_03_07938-A-0016)
[SIGH] RIGHT YEAH I REMEMBER BEING THERE AND GEORGIA WATCHED THAT MODEL AND THEY  (fe_03_07938-A-0017)
REWORDED IT SO THAT IT WOULDN'T CUT THE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07938-A-0018)
'CAUSE I ALSO LIVED IN GEORGIA  (fe_03_07938-A-0019)
AND I DID STUDENT TEACHING  (fe_03_07938-A-0020)
IN GEORGIA [SIGH] AND MY AND MY SISTER  (fe_03_07938-A-0021)
MY  (fe_03_07938-A-0022)
TWO OF MY SISTERS HAVE GRADUATED FROM PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN GEORGIA [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_07938-A-0023)
AND WELL I'M SORRY ONE OF THEM GRADUATED FROM PRIVATE THEY BOTH WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN GEORGIA THOUGH AT DIFFERENT TIMES UM  (fe_03_07938-A-0024)
BUT I THINK THAT HELPED THEM OUT A LOT TOO IS THE WAY THEY DID THE FUNDING  (fe_03_07938-A-0025)
I THINK ONE OF  (fe_03_07938-A-0026)
[NOISE] I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY BY STATE  (fe_03_07938-A-0030)
I THINK IT IT'S DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AND I THINK THE BEST ONES ARE THE ONES WHERE THE PARENTS ARE MOST INVOLVED  (fe_03_07938-A-0031)
UM  (fe_03_07938-A-0032)
I ALSO THINK [SIGH] YOU KNOW IT'S HARD I KNOW FROM BEING A TEACHER IT'S HARD TO GET SOME PARENTS INVOLVED  (fe_03_07938-A-0033)
UM  (fe_03_07938-A-0034)
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THE PARENTS DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR KIDS BUT [MN] YOU KNOW THERE'S PARENTS THAT ARE  (fe_03_07938-A-0035)
YOU KNOW BOTH PARENTS ARE WORKING ONE OF THEM'S WORKING TWO JOBS OR THREE JOBS JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET SO THEY CAN'T BE THERE  (fe_03_07938-A-0036)
UM AND IT REALLY AFFECTS THE KIDS  (fe_03_07938-A-0037)
YEAH  (fe_03_07938-A-0039)
IT IT IS NATIONWIDE I THINK UM BUT I DON'T THINK [MN] SEE I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THAT MONEY IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER  (fe_03_07938-A-0040)
BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK AT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE LOTS OF MONEY AND THAT STILL  (fe_03_07938-A-0042)
AREN'T PROVIDING WHAT THE KIDS REALLY NEED  (fe_03_07938-A-0043)
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOTTA FIGURE OUT IS AND THE OTHER PROBLEM I I I REMEMBER SOME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IN GEORGIA WHEN I WAS STUDENT TEACHING AND COMPARING  (fe_03_07938-A-0045)
UM THERE WERE SEVERAL OF US UM I WAS TAKING A CLASS AND WE WERE ALL TEACHING A DIFFERENT SCHOOL  (fe_03_07938-A-0046)
AND THEY SAID ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WAS [NOISE] THAT THE COUNTY LOOKED AT WHAT WAS WORKING IN ONE SCHOOL  (fe_03_07938-A-0047)
IN A MORE AFFLUENT AREA  (fe_03_07938-A-0048)
AND THEN TELLING THE PEOPLE IN THE POORER AREAS THEY SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING WITH THEIR KIDS BECAUSE IT WAS DOING A GOOD JOB UP THERE  (fe_03_07938-A-0049)
AND I THINK WHEN WE TRY TO CREATE A MOULD THAT THIS IS WHAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS SHOULD BE  (fe_03_07938-A-0051)
WE CREATE MORE PROBLEMS  (fe_03_07938-A-0052)
BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO LET INDIVIDUAL  (fe_03_07938-A-0053)
IT WOULD REALLY DEPEND WHERE I WAS  (fe_03_07938-A-0054)
I WOULD CERTAINLY CHECK OUT THE SCHOOLS CAREFULLY [SIGH]  (fe_03_07938-A-0055)
BEFORE I DECIDED  (fe_03_07938-A-0056)
UM IN AN AREA LIKE WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW I MIGHT SEND 'EM TO PRIVATE JUST BECAUSE I  (fe_03_07938-A-0057)
WELL I TAUGHT IN A CATHOLIC SCHOOL HERE  (fe_03_07938-A-0058)
AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MY CHILDREN IN A CATHOLIC SCHOOL  (fe_03_07938-A-0059)
BUT MONEY'S ALSO AN ISSUE  (fe_03_07938-A-0060)
SO  (fe_03_07938-A-0061)
AND THAT'S THEY UH THAT'S THE THING  (fe_03_07938-A-0062)
I DON'T THINK IT'S EVEN THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY HONESTLY I THINK IT'S THE PARENT'S RESPONSIBILITY  (fe_03_07938-A-0063)
AMONG OTHER THINGS [LAUGHTER] YEAH  (fe_03_07938-A-0064)
WELL THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR TEACHERS TOO  (fe_03_07938-A-0065)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_07938-A-0066)
YEAH SEE WE ACTUALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA IT WAS THE OPPOSITE SOUTH CAROLINA WAS PAYING BETTER  (fe_03_07938-A-0067)
AND I WASN'T THAT CLOSE TO THE TO THE STATE LINE THAT I WOULD'VE GONE OVER BUT THEY SAID IN LIKE IN CH- I MEAN EVEN IN CHARLOTTE I WAS NORTH OF CHARLOTTE BUT EVEN IN CHARLOTTE PEOPLE WERE GOING DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA  (fe_03_07938-A-0068)
YEAH WELL I THINK REALLY ANYWHERE YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE YOU CAN GET THE PARENTS IN  (fe_03_07938-A-0069)
AND SOMETIMES THAT'S ESPECIALLY HARD IN HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_07938-A-0070)
'CAUSE THE KIDS TELL 'EM TO LEAVE  (fe_03_07938-A-0071)
YEAH YEAH ACROSS THE BORDER ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS SEEM TO HAVE FEWER PROBLEMS  (fe_03_07938-A-0072)
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE THERE MORE [SIGH]  (fe_03_07938-A-0073)
AND THAT I THINK IS THE KEY RIGHT THERE  (fe_03_07938-A-0074)
IT'S JUS YOU GOTTA GET PARENTS TO STAY INVOLVED IN THEIR KID'S EDUCATION  (fe_03_07938-A-0075)
I'M SORRY AND SO WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP PARENTS INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION  (fe_03_07938-A-0076)
YES  (fe_03_07938-A-0077)
OH YEAH  (fe_03_07938-A-0078)
THEY NEED TO BE WILLING TO TO SIT DOWN AND WORK WITH THEIR KIDS AND YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME OF OUR I KNOW SOME SCHOOLS HAVE TRIED YOU KNOW LIKE COMMUNITY NIGHTS WHERE THEY BRING THE PARENTS IN  (fe_03_07938-A-0079)
AND HAVE ACTIVITIES AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_07938-A-0080)
