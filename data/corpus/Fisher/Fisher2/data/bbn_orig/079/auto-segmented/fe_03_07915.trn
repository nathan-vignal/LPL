MHM  (fe_03_07915-B-0028)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07915-B-0029)
I THINK PEOPLE ARE AS MATERIALISTIC AS THEY EVER HAVE BEEN I THINK MORE OF THEM ARE SAYING THEY'RE NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BE ANYMORE  (fe_03_07915-B-0030)
[LAUGHTER] BUT UM  (fe_03_07915-B-0031)
I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE CHANGE  (fe_03_07915-B-0032)
THAT DRAMATICALLY UM  (fe_03_07915-B-0033)
[SIGH] SO YES I BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE MATERIALISTIC I ALSO TEND TO BELIEVE THAT FRIENDS ARE  (fe_03_07915-B-0034)
MORE DISPOSABLE THAN THEY USED TO BE  (fe_03_07915-B-0035)
I THINK WE HAVE A SOCIETY WHERE WE'RE COMMUNICATING MORE INDIRECTLY BY EMAIL AND BY  (fe_03_07915-B-0036)
VOICEMAIL AND WHATEVER SO THAT  (fe_03_07915-B-0037)
AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07915-B-0038)
PEOPLE  (fe_03_07915-B-0039)
YES  (fe_03_07915-B-0040)
SO  (fe_03_07915-B-0042)
I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A REASON WHY S._U._V.S ARE THE BEST SELLING CAR AROUND AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BIGGER FAMILIES AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING CAMPING MORE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE AND TRENDY  (fe_03_07915-B-0043)
SO  (fe_03_07915-B-0044)
[MN] THERE'S A REASON WHY  (fe_03_07915-B-0046)
THEY'RE SELLING KNOCK OFFS OF DESIGNER HANDBAGS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT DESIGNER HANDBAGS WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD THEM OR NOT  (fe_03_07915-B-0047)
SO I THINK  (fe_03_07915-B-0048)
I THINK PEOPLE ARE EVERY BIT AS MATERIALISTIC AS THEY EVER HAVE BEEN  (fe_03_07915-B-0049)
AND THEY'RE FINDING YOU KNOW THERE'S A REASON WHY DEBT IN AMERICA EXCEEDS WHAT IT EVER HAS BEEN  (fe_03_07915-B-0050)
IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MATERIALISTIC IN THEIR SPENDING  (fe_03_07915-B-0051)
SO UM I THINK THAT THIS I THINK THAT THIS IS A  (fe_03_07915-B-0052)
CERTAINLY A VALID QUESTION FOR THE TIMES IF WE'RE SPENDING LESS TIME WITH PEOPLE AND WE'RE STILL PURSUING THE SAME OR MORE  (fe_03_07915-B-0053)
MATERIAL  (fe_03_07915-B-0054)
AH [MN] ON MATERIAL GOODS THEN I THINK THE QUESTION HAS GREAT VALIDITY  (fe_03_07915-B-0055)
I THINK  (fe_03_07915-B-0056)
IF I HADN'T HAD A BEST FRIEND A LONG STANDING VERY GOOD VERY DEAR VERY IMPORTANT BEST FRIEND  (fe_03_07915-B-0057)
THEN I COULD LOOK AT IT AND SAY HUH  (fe_03_07915-B-0058)
PEOPLE ARE DISPOSABLE A MILLION BUCKS IS GREAT GO FOR IT  (fe_03_07915-B-0059)
SO I THINK THAT WHILE EVERYBODY MAY SAY NO I WOULDN'T DO IT I THINK THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY WOULD  (fe_03_07915-B-0060)
WOULD BE INTERESTING  (fe_03_07915-B-0063)
IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE  (fe_03_07915-B-0064)
AND WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY'RE GETTING PEOPLE TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT  (fe_03_07915-B-0065)
YEP THEY DO  (fe_03_07915-B-0067)
