HELLO  (fe_03_07935-A-0001)
[SIGH] [NOISE] [SIGH] [MN] WELL MAX MY NAME IS PAULA  (fe_03_07935-A-0002)
AND UM I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT YOU SAY UM THEY COULD USE A LOT MORE RESOURCES  (fe_03_07935-A-0003)
[SIGH] I KNOW FUNDING IS ALSO A PROBLEM AND I KNOW UM [SIGH] TEACHERS' PAY AND THE FACT THAT UM [SIGH] HEALTH INSURANCE IS SUCH A LARGE EXPENSE  (fe_03_07935-A-0004)
EXPENSE THESE DAYS AND UM IT'S DIFFICULT FOR UM  (fe_03_07935-A-0005)
T- THE MONEY YOU KNOW TO BE FOUND TO DO THESE THINGS [SIGH] I THINK WE HAVE SOME EXCELLENT PUBLIC SCHOOLS I STILL REALLY BELIEVE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07935-A-0006)
AND W- WOULD STILL WANT MY CHILDREN TO BE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  (fe_03_07935-A-0007)
[NOISE] WELL JUST HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR AND IF A CHILD HAS A LEARNING DISABILITY THAT CAUSES T- THEM TO BE DISRUPTIVE AND THEY CAN'T OBEY THE RULES [SIGH] I AGREE THAT SOME SP-  (fe_03_07935-A-0009)
UM SOME SPECIAL [SIGH] CLASSROOM SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO FUNCTION IN  (fe_03_07935-A-0010)
AS LONG AS THEY CAN AH  (fe_03_07935-A-0011)
H- HAVE SOME SPECIAL H- HELP THAT WILL  (fe_03_07935-A-0013)
GET THEM TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE ALL CHILDREN EVEN IF THEY HAVE A DISABILITY [SIGH] SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO UM ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07935-A-0014)
[SIGH] BUT UM YOU'RE RIGHT AH IN THAT SITUATION A TEACHER WOULD NEED A MUCH SMALLER CLASSROOM [SIGH] AND SOME SPECIAL TRAINING FOR DEALING WITH THOSE KINDS OF STUDENTS  (fe_03_07935-A-0015)
UH-HUM [LIPSMACK] AND I THINK THAT THE T- THE AH PARENTS NEED TO BE HELD [SIGH] RESPONSIBLE ALSO AND THAT THEY NEED TO ATTEND  (fe_03_07935-A-0018)
[SIGH] WHEN THEY ARE CALLED TO THE SCHOOL BECAUSE OF A DISCIPLINARY ACTION THEY NEED TO [SIGH] EITHER COME UP THERE AND HELP TO KEEP THAT CHILD IN SCHOOL AND HELP TO SEE THAT THAT CHILD OBEYS THE [SIGH] THE LAW AND THE RULES OR EITHER THEY NEED TO  (fe_03_07935-A-0019)
F- FIND THEMSELVES IN COURT TO FIND OUT AH WHAT  (fe_03_07935-A-0020)
WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO FALL DOWN ON THE JOB TO NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL [SIGH] AND SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN  (fe_03_07935-A-0021)

[SIGH] UM AND YES AND AND CHILDREN NEED ALL CHILDREN NEED T- TO FEEL SAFE  (fe_03_07935-A-0027)
[SIGH] WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL AND I THINK SOMETIMES CHILDREN DON'T ALWAYS FEEL SAFE I KNOW THAT [SIGH] IN SOME OF THE SCHOOLS HERE WHERE I LIVE THERE ARE GANGS [SIGH] UM THAT OPERATE RIGHT IN THE SCHOOL AND THE CHILDREN ARE SO FEARFUL  (fe_03_07935-A-0028)
[SIGH] AH OF THE GANGS AND THEY'RE FEARFUL FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY JUST TO GO TO SCHOOL AND A CHILD SHOULD NEVER FEEL UNSAFE IN THEIR OWN SCHOOL [NOISE] [NOISE] [NOISE] [SIGH]  (fe_03_07935-A-0029)
[SIGH] [SIGH] [NOISE] [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] WELL I I DO THINK SAFETY'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND WHATEVER WE HAVE TO DO TO GET PAST THIS PROBLEM WITH THE CHILDREN NOT FEELING SAFE IN SCHOOL WE NEED TO DO THAT [SIGH] UM AND ON THE BUSES AND EVERYTHING SO THAT CHILDREN  (fe_03_07935-A-0030)

HEAD START IS IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE I THINK HEAD S- START WAS SUCH A GOOD PROGRAM IS SUCH A GOOD PROGRAM TO P- PREPARE THESE CHILDREN FOR SCHOOL [SIGH] SO THAT THEY DO S- SUCCEED ONCE THEY GET THERE  (fe_03_07935-A-0034)
AND AH IF FUNDS ARE CUT TO HEAD START AND THEY DON'T GET UM [SIGH] THAT EDUCATION LIKE YOU SAID WHEN THEY START OUT AT AN EARLY AGE LEARNING THESE THINGS AND THAT  (fe_03_07935-A-0035)
AND SOME AND TO SOME EXTENT [SIGH] IF THEY'RE NOT TAUGHT THOSE THINGS V- VERY VERY YOUNG [SIGH] IT'S A LOT HARDER FOR THEM TO CATCH ON LATER  (fe_03_07935-A-0036)

IT'S A GOOD IDEA  (fe_03_07935-A-0050)
WELL I THINK IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO CARE ENOUGH ABOUT TO GET INVOLVED IN MAYBE THE CHURCHES UM SHOULD SAY YOU KNOW MAYBE THE CHURCHES CAN HELP TO RUN SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN THE EVENING SO THAT IT'S N- NOT SUCH AN EXPENSE  (fe_03_07935-A-0051)
FOR THE STATE OR FOR THE CITY [SIGH] AH BUT YOU KNOW TAKE A RESPONSIBILITY FORM THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND AND JUST MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE TO LIVE [SIGH] THE SCHOOLS USED TO BE [MN] CONSIDERED A KIND OF THE HEART OF THE COMMUNITY  (fe_03_07935-A-0052)
AND A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE KNEW IT WAS SAFE TO GO AND THERE WOULD BE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS THERE FOR THEIR CHILDREN  (fe_03_07935-A-0053)
[SIGH] AND NOW I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE HAVE THAT SAME FEELING ABOUT IT BUT MAYBE WE COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK IF WE [SIGH] REALLY GOT INVOLVED GRANDPARENTS CAN HELP TOO AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT W- THAT YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE [SIGH] BUT GRANDPARENTS CAN BE  (fe_03_07935-A-0054)

[SIGH] MORE FUNDS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07935-B-0003)
[SIGH] THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE TEACHERS AND MORE HOURS AND AH IF NECESSARY HAVE [SIGH] HAVE AH CLASSES IN THE SUMMERTIME  (fe_03_07935-B-0005)

BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER CHILDREN [SIGH] WHO DON'T HAVE A LEARNING DISABILITY [NOISE] WHO IN FACT MAY HAVE A HIGH I._Q. BUT [SIGH] THEIR PARENTS  (fe_03_07935-B-0012)
DON'T TEACH 'EM RESPECT [SIGH] DON'T TEACH 'EM DISCIPLINE [NOISE] AND THESE THINGS SHOULD BE TAUGHT AT A VERY VERY EARLY AGE [SIGH] WHEN A CHILD FIRST GOES TO SCHOOL [SIGH]  (fe_03_07935-B-0013)
THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO RESPECT T- THEIR [NOISE] PARENTS NUMBER ONE [SIGH] THEIR TEACHERS NUMBER TWO AND [SIGH] ANY OTHER GROWNUP A- AH  (fe_03_07935-B-0014)

YEARS AGO A CHILD WENT TO THE BATHROOM THEY WENT BY THEMSELVES TO THE BATHROOM [NOISE] [SIGH] WHY BECAUSE THE TEACHERS THEIR HANDS WERE NOT TIED [NOISE]  (fe_03_07935-B-0033)
