OUR TEACHERS DOWN HERE DON'T MAKE NOTHING HARDLY  (fe_03_07967-A-0015)
THEY'RE DOING IT FOR FORTY THOUSAND A YEAR  (fe_03_07967-A-0016)
NOW IF YOU'RE IN A BIG CITY LIKE DALLAS HOUSTON NOW YOU MAKE MONEY BUT  (fe_03_07967-A-0017)
AS FAR AS SCHOOLS THEY NEED TO INCORPORATE TO PAY THE TEACHERS MORE  (fe_03_07967-A-0018)
THE SUPERINTENDENT NEEDS TO MAKE MORE AND THEY JUST NEED TO DISCIPLINE THE KIDS BETTER  (fe_03_07967-A-0019)

TRYING TO YOU KNOW AH TAKE MORE AH SERIOUS INTEREST IN THE KIDS HEALTH INSTEAD OF THEM EATING JUNK FOOD SO THEY'LL EAT THEIR LUNCHES BUT  (fe_03_07967-A-0021)
I THINK A LOT OF IT'S JUST UNDERPAID  (fe_03_07967-A-0022)
AND OVERWORKED STAFF AND NOT ENOUGH OF 'EM  (fe_03_07967-A-0023)
IF THEY'D OFFER MORE INCENTIVE I THINK THEY'D HAVE MORE TEACHERS  (fe_03_07967-A-0024)
YEAH THE ADMINISTRATION EITHER AND THEY NEED TO REALLY REALLY  (fe_03_07967-A-0026)
SCREEN PEOPLE WHO THEY HIRE TO WORK IN SCHOOL SYSTEMS  (fe_03_07967-A-0028)

'CAUSE THE TROUBLE IS THE GOOD KIDS INTO SOMETHING  (fe_03_07967-A-0054)
FOR THEM TO HAVE ALWAYS YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF YOU KNOW SOME MONIES AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE OR TO HAVE MORE S- HAVE ACTIVITIES FOR KIDS  (fe_03_07967-A-0055)

SHE'S A HARD WORKER SHE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH WHATEVER SHE DONE AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07967-A-0067)
ONE DAY SHE FOUND A BUG IN THE FOOD AND SHE SAID TO THEM ABOUT IT AND SHE GOT FIRED FROM HER JOB FOR BRINGING IT UP  (fe_03_07967-A-0068)
SHE USED TO THINK IT WAS VERY HEALTHY VERY SAFE FOR KIDS EATING THAT FOOD  (fe_03_07967-A-0069)
SHE SPOKE HER MIND AND IT GOT HER KICKED OUT OF A JOB BUT SHE WASN'T MAKING BUT FIVE FIFTY AN HOUR  (fe_03_07967-A-0070)

MEANWHILE THEY FIRED HER  (fe_03_07967-A-0075)

MHM  (fe_03_07967-B-0019)
RIGHT YOU SO YOU THINK BASICALLY THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE TEA- THE TEACHING AND OF AH THE PAYMENT SCALE OF IT  (fe_03_07967-B-0020)
THE THE ADMINISTRATION THEY DON'T PAY ENOUGH TO THE TEACHERS THAT'S WHY THE SCHOOLS ARE BAD MM  (fe_03_07967-B-0021)

OH MY GOD  (fe_03_07967-B-0023)
OH GOSH  (fe_03_07967-B-0024)
THAT IS SO SAD  (fe_03_07967-B-0026)
I THINK THE WHOLE SYSTEM THE SCHOOLING SYSTEM NEEDS SOME SERIOUS REVAMPING AND RETHINKING  (fe_03_07967-B-0027)
I SERIOUSLY THINK THAT I I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE UNIFORMS IN IN SCHOOLS I THINK THE CHILDREN SHOULD BE DRESSED IN UNIFORM  (fe_03_07967-B-0028)
THAT BRINGS A LITTLE MORE DISCIPLINE NOT MANY PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME BUT I AH REALLY THINK SO SO THAT IT TAKES YOUR MIND OFF OF DRESSING AND LOOKING GOOD  (fe_03_07967-B-0029)
AND PAY MORE ATTENTION TO STUDIES EVERYBODY WEARS THE SAME CLOTHES TO SCHOOL THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07967-B-0030)
NOT THAT ALL PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE GREAT BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THEY PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS PRODUCE BETTER STUDENTS THAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS  (fe_03_07967-B-0031)
THEY SHOULD BE DRESSED EQUALLY THERE SHOULD BE MORE DISCIPLINE  (fe_03_07967-B-0032)
WHAT IS THAT  (fe_03_07967-B-0033)
ABSOLUTELY THEY WHAT NOT DO THEY WEAR MY GOODNESS THAT WOULD PUT I CAN NOT LOOK STRAIGHT I WAS AT ONE OF THE RESTAURANTS WITH MY HUSBAND AND I SAW A PROM KIDS COME OUT  (fe_03_07967-B-0034)
THERE AND IT WAS PROM NIGHT AND IT WAS VERY BUSY AND THE KIND OF OUTFITS THE GIRLS WORE I UNDERSTAND PROM NIGHT IS A BIG NIGHT AND KIDS DON'T DRESS THAT WAY IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_07967-B-0035)
BUT THE VERY FACT THAT THEY COULD THINK OF DRESSING LIKE THAT MY GOODNESS I ALMOST THOUGHT WHETHER MY CHILDREN SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL IT  (fe_03_07967-B-0036)
WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS IT IS VERY SCARY TO SEE THAT AND IT'S NOT JUST COMING WITH THE DRESS PART OF IT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS  (fe_03_07967-B-0037)
THE WAY THEY BEHAVE I HAVE SEEN I HAVE HEARD THAT KIDS KIND OF  (fe_03_07967-B-0038)
THEY THEY THEY STICK THEIR FEET ON THE BENCHES IN FRONT OF THEIR TEACHERS  (fe_03_07967-B-0039)
I MEAN SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL RESPECT IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK BEHAVIOR PART OF IT THAT IT IT DE- THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED SO I GUESS THAT'S HOW I I LOOK AT IT  (fe_03_07967-B-0040)
DEFINITELY THE KIDS NEED TO THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_07967-B-0041)
AND IT COMES WITH YOU KNOW YOU GET BETTER TEACHERS FOR BETTER TEACHERS YOU NEED TO PAY THEM BETTER  (fe_03_07967-B-0042)
MHM  (fe_03_07967-B-0043)
HOW DO WE DO THAT HOW HOW DO WE CORRECT THAT SITUATION  (fe_03_07967-B-0044)
I MEAN IT'S PASSING THE BUCK I I GUESS PARENTS CAN SAY THE THE SCHOOL IS BAD AND SCHOOL CAN SAY IT ALL STARTS AT HOME  (fe_03_07967-B-0045)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07967-B-0047)
