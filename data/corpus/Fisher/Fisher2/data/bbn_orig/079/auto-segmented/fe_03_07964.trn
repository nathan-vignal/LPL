[NOISE] WELL I BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN THEY'RE OUR FUTURE AND THE TEACHERS A LOT OF TEACHERS DON'T WANNA UM  (fe_03_07964-B-0005)
[NOISE] A LOT OF TEACHERS HAVE PROBLEMS TEACHING THE KIDS BECAUSE OF THEIR SALARY I DON'T BELIEVE TEACHERS ARE GETTING PAID ENOUGH  (fe_03_07964-B-0006)
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO'S INVESTING INTO OUR FUTURE AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN GETTING PAID THAT MUCH  (fe_03_07964-B-0007)
AND TO UM DEAL WITH THE KIDS NOWADAYS I BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY BE PAID A LOT MORE THAN WHAT THEY'RE BEING PAID  (fe_03_07964-B-0008)
SO  (fe_03_07964-B-0009)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07964-B-0010)
BECAUSE SOME TEACHERS THEY JUST AREN'T MOTIVATED ENOUGH BECAUSE OF THEIR SALARY AND PEOPLE AREN'T MOTIVATED TO TEACH BECAUSE OF THE  (fe_03_07964-B-0011)
SALARY AND A UM DIFFERENT THINGS THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH  (fe_03_07964-B-0012)
UM  (fe_03_07964-B-0013)

FROM UM THEIR FAMILY  (fe_03_07964-B-0018)
TO EXCEED WELL  (fe_03_07964-B-0019)
EXCUSE ME  (fe_03_07964-B-0020)
YES  (fe_03_07964-B-0021)
[LIPSMACK] BY SUPPORTING THE KIDS BECAUSE SOMETIMES CHILDREN DON'T GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AT HOME TO SUCCEED AT SCHOOL AND I BELIEVE THAT IF UM TEACHERS WERE MORE  (fe_03_07964-B-0022)
WOULD GIVE THE CHILDREN MORE RESPECT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE UM BETTER MOTIVATION AND WOULD DO BETTER IN SCHOOL 'CAUSE SOME TEACHERS THEY JUST UM THEY NOWADAYS TEACHERS WOULD TELL A KID THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SUCCEED OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO NOTHING IN LIFE  (fe_03_07964-B-0023)
YES  (fe_03_07964-B-0024)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07964-B-0025)
YES I BELIEVE BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_07964-B-0026)
[LIPSMACK] WE PAY DOCTORS UM A LARGE SALARY  (fe_03_07964-B-0027)
FOR UM WHAT THEY DO AS WELL AS SAVING LIVES AND HELPING TO SAVE LIVES AND CARE FOR PEOPLE BUT UM TEACHERS ARE CARING FOR THE PEOPLE ALSO AND THEY'RE SAVING LIVES ALSO  (fe_03_07964-B-0028)
SO UM EVEN IT REQUIRES THEM TO GO TO SCHOOL LONGER AS THE DOCTORS DO  (fe_03_07964-B-0029)
BUT UM TO ALSO INCREASE THEIR PAY WITH THAT  (fe_03_07964-B-0030)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07964-B-0031)
I JUST THINK UM THE SCREENING PROCESS FOR TEACHERS  (fe_03_07964-B-0032)
UM SHOULD BE BETTER  (fe_03_07964-B-0033)
UM  (fe_03_07964-B-0034)
IN CERTAIN PLACES I'VE I'VE UM PERSONALLY HAD BAD TEACHERS  (fe_03_07964-B-0035)
SO I JUST THINK UM IT SHOULD JUST BE UM A STRICTER POLICY WHEN HIRING TEACHERS [NOISE]  (fe_03_07964-B-0036)
WELL I UM KNOW WHEN I EXPERIENCED GOING TO A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT A LOT OF THE TEACHERS WEREN'T EVEN CERTIFIED OR THEY WERE STILL IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_07964-B-0037)
BECOMING CERTIFIED WHILE THEY WERE TEACHING SO  (fe_03_07964-B-0038)
I DON'T BELIEVE UM THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED I MEAN I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASSIST OTHER TEACHERS OR MAYBE HELP THEM OUT IN UM TO SEE HOW TEACHING REALLY IS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE UM JUST READY YET  (fe_03_07964-B-0039)
OR GIVE 'EM UM EVEN THE BETTER BENEFITS [NOISE]  (fe_03_07964-B-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_07964-B-0041)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07964-B-0042)
RIGHT AND I BELIEVE THAT UM [LIPSMACK] PARENTS SHOULD ALSO GET INVOLVED MORE WITH THEIR CHILDREN  (fe_03_07964-B-0043)
INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT ALL ON TEACHERS  (fe_03_07964-B-0044)
[LIPSMACK] UM I DON'T KNOW TRY TO GET MORE PARENT INVOLVEMENT WITH THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION  (fe_03_07964-B-0045)
MORE PARENT TEACHER EVENTS  (fe_03_07964-B-0048)
OR MAKE IT UM MOR- MAKE THE EVENTS MORE EXCITING  (fe_03_07964-B-0050)

RIGHT OR HAVE EVENTS THEY HAVE EVENTS WHERE THE STUDENTS HAVE EVENTS FOR THE TEACHERS ALSO FOR THE STAFF HAVE STAFF ON THE EVENTS  (fe_03_07964-B-0053)

UM THE CHILDREN FEEL THAT WHI- WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING AND TEACHERS FEEL THAT ALSO  (fe_03_07964-B-0066)
SO  (fe_03_07964-B-0067)
RIGHT AND WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY ARE YOU IN  (fe_03_07964-B-0068)
OH OKAY  (fe_03_07964-B-0069)
