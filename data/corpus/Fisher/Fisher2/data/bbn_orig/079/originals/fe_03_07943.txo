L:  [NOISE]  Dot.
R:  Patty.  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Oh, hi!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't know ... I was on yet.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, you're here.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  So, ...
L:  So, yeah, do you think there's anything wrong with the, ah, US public school system?
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah, there's ... too much ... s- stuff that's going on with the s- shootings and ... g- guns and drugs and ...
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Where are you from?
R:  Huh?
L:  Where are you from exactly?
R:  Missouri.  [SIGH]  You?
L:  Really?
R:  Where?
L:  I'm from, ah, Seattle, Washington.
R:  Washington?  [MN]  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  Hey, um, there's, like, a lot of noise out.  I'm going to get in my car, it's like, sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, t- there's ... been a lot of deaths in the schools here lately.  When I was in school you didn't have to worry about that kind of stuff.
L:  How old are you?  [SIGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  How old are you?
R:  How old am I?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Forty.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How old are you?
L:  Ah, twenty one.  [NOISE]
R:  Twenty one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, I actually just got out of the school system, a couple years ago.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, w- well --
R:  We should --
L:  -- I figure I -- I'd have to agree.  Definitely.  [NOISE]
R:  Were you scared when you was going to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- school?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, actually I -- I'm from kind of a -- a -- a decent part of town.  I guess in -- in m- my area there weren't too many -- too many problems.  We didn't really have any fights or anything like that so I didn't have to worry as much.  [COUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I know that c- certain parts of the, ah, United States it's definitely a problem.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, [SIGH] yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with ... the areas the schools are in, though.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  You know.
R:  Right.  Usually the big cities is the worst.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  I live in a smaller place so it wasn't so bad here but it seems like ... there for a while -- e- every time you turn on the news, you know, you get -- h- hearing of killings or shootings or [SIGH] something a- at the schools.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  We really -- we haven't had too many problems in the State of Washington but, um, we get the national news and we hear, you know, like, the Columbine shootings --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that -- sort of all those.  They're the only ones that we really [SIGH] get too much coverage on.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, [SIGH] s- so, how do you think they could f- fix it though?
R:  Hm, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, unless they d- do metal detectors before you're even allowed in to schools anymore.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  To s- see if you have any w- weapons on you, 'cause a lot of t- them, is hid and, [SIGH] you know, maybe it would show up if they ... s- scanned everybody.  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.  There are a few schools in Washington State I know that have ... metal detectors.  I know my buddy was from California and he -- [SIGH] every public school in his district they had metal detectors and police officers on guard.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I mean that corrected some of the problems, I guess.  The, ah, crime rate went down ... a little bit but there's still --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they always have a way to get, you know, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- around the systems.
R:  And any more, you know, you can buy guns anywhere, you know, and -- but a lot of the k- kids -- you know, some of those little kids are small, you know, like t- twelve years old, shooting, you know.  They're getting it [SIGH] out of their dad's ho -- you know, their houses, [NOISE] you know.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  They need to keep them locked up [SIGH]--
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- where the kids can't get them.  [NOISE]
L:  So, a lot of these kids, obviously, get the -- the guns -- they come from households or families where, you know, [LAUGH] the parents just really don't care.  They don't --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know.  They're out doing -- I don't know, p- probably out, you know, doing stuff that they s- [LAUGH] shouldn't be doing,
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as the best example for their kids.  [SIGH]
R:  R- right.
L:  You know, their role model is --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- not the best.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I believe in guns, you know, for protection, you know.  I -- I even own guns but, [SIGH] you know, when I had kids at home, I've only got one daughter, s- she's twenty one now but, [SIGH] you know, they are locked up.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  D- definitely.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  Hm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  They don't really give you a -- a topic you can really e- [LAUGH] expand on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Anything.  You pretty much get done with the conversation [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in two sentences[?], you know what I mean?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh!
R:  So, how's Washington?
L:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah, Washington?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Washington's all right.  It's actually a scorcher today it's -- of course I don't know how it is in Missouri, over here it's, like, may be eighty five degrees.  People are out sweating, cooking eggs on the s- [LAUGH] sidewalk, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It doesn't get this hot out here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  N- no.
R:  It's been running around ninety five here.
L:  Oh, God, how's the humidity?
R:  It's high.  It's, like, ... [NOISE] eighty -- [SIGH] eighty seven percent.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, my God!  [NOISE]
R:  It's ... very hot.  [LAUGH]  It feels --
L:  I hear what you say.
R:  -- it feels like -- it's like a hundred and something here.  [NOISE]
L:  God!  That's one thing we don't have is humidity.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, it's bad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here.  [SIGH]
L:  Missouri, yeah, I bet.
R:  You break a sweat not doing anything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, while you're just sitting here.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Bring out your shoes[?] for me to s- [LAUGH] tep outside.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Boy, it's bad though.  [SIGH]  North Carolina ... it's the same way over there it's just humid and muggy and all sorts of ... you know?
R:  So, are you going to college?
L:  [MN]  Ah, right now, y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Ah -- I, ah, was going to a community college for ... two quarters a- and I was taking some entrepreneurial classes 'cause I'm going to -- [SIGH] a tanning salon actually.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Out here, -- um, here in Washington you don't really get [LAUGH] -- we don't get tanned.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe two months out of -- it's actually a pretty, ah, l- lucrative ... business out here.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that -- that's my plan.  What do you do?
R:  A- ah, I'm just a housewife.  My daughter she's going to Orion School.
L:  Oh, yeah, -- oh, really?  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  So, ...
L:  I have a bunch of friends that ... just graduated this last quarter for -- for, a- ah, to ... become nurses.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, they're ... very much in demand nowadays.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  Of course they're also very -- s- slave driven almost.
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  The hours they have to work.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [MN]  Have you been a housewife your whole life?
R:  [SIGH]  A- ah, w- w- -- l- last five years.  I came down with cancer so --
L:  Oh, God!  I'm [LAUGH] sorry.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is it g- getting better?
R:  A- ah, I'm doing chemo right now but -- what I've got there ain't no cure for unless I get a bone marrow transplant.  I have bone marrow cancer.  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  My dad also had it and he d- died of it about ... seven years ago when -- [SIGH] after he died I thought maybe I was just depressed and not feeling good.  Well, I went to the doctor and they done blood work and come to find out I've got it too.  So, it's in the genes.  [SIGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  So, [SIGH] yeah, forty years old struggling with this shit.  [LAUGH]
L:  God damn!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]

L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  This is pretty cool though --
L:  Y- yeah, it's --
R:  -- you get to ... talk to everyone on it.
L:  -- [NOISE] about some random topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- believe that they find out about the person[?].
R:  Ten dollars a phone call.  [LAUGH]  If we get paid!
L:  I know!  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope we get paid.
L:  [LAUGH]  Right.
R:  They said it could take up to about two months to get your money.  So ...

L:  No, well I got an email from a friend of mine and she said, um -- she sent it to me and she works -- she works for ... m- marketing and she's actually one of the marketing directors for ... this program --
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]

She said they always [SIGH] use emails and, like, make five dollars in five minutes and they're like things like this, phone conversations or [SIGH] modeling gigs or spokesperson reps f- for different companies and so [SIGH] -- so it's pretty cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh!
L:  Having a friend where you can make ... quick money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you make very much money doing this kind of stuff?
L:  [COUGH]  Um, this is actually the first one I did.  [NOISE]  Um, [LAUGH] one of the ones she sent me was, ah, to be a spokesperson for tobacco.  [LAUGH]
