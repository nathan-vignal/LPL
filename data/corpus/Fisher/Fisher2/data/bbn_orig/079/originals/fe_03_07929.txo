L:  Hello, my name is Maxine.
R:  Yeah, hi, my name is Mike.  [SIGH]
L:  I'm thirty eight and I live in West Virginia.
R:  [MN]  I'm twenty three and I live in Boston, Massachussetts.  [NOISE]
L:  Pleased to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- met you.
R:  [SIGH]  You too.  [SIGH]  So, what is your opinion on the, ah -- on the school system right now?  [SIGH]
L:  Well, I don't know if the -- if the problem is, ah, what we have, you know, in other areas --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but the school system in my area [SIGH] which I have, ah, two sons; my youngest is sixteen --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and my oldest is twenty one.  [SIGH]  And the problem that we had here when I was in school [SIGH] is they have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teachers, [SIGH] ah, teaching subjects --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that they're not qualified to teach.
R:  Who weren't qualified to teach?  [SIGH]
L:  No, they're not.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They're -- they're, like, taking the math teacher and letting math teachers teach English or --
R:  Or, right.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] yeah, you know what I'm saying?  And --
R:  I hear you.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and to me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] u- um, the kids aren't, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, getting out of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, what -- [SIGH] what they need to be getting out of it.  I don't know if it's that way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in your area or not?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  No, I actually lived in California and out there we had ... a lot of the worst public school systems that I've ever seen.  And just [NOISE] certain parts of it I -- I felt like [SIGH] the society, like, American society in general doesn't ... give teachers enough credit.  [SIGH]  Like, they don't, you know, -- I feel like they should be -- it -- it should be a more respectable position [SIGH] because otherwise there aren't people who take it seriously, [SIGH] you know, and really --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- really going for it.  Like I feel like the -- if -- if the teachers were [SIGH] -- were better paid and were more comfortable [SIGH] then they can apply more of their -- their time to, like, devoting, you know, to the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- students and really [SIGH] -- really flourishing that way.  And more people -- there would be more teachers coming into the school systems; there would be more [SIGH] room for specialized people; there would be -- [SIGH] you know, I feel like that 'cause that -- that really is the future as far as I'm -- you know, as far as I'm concerned.  It's, like, how we bring our children up is really [SIGH] what's going to make the difference tomorrow, [SIGH] you know.  So, it's -- it's very important.  [NOISE] [SIGH]  But, ah, [SIGH] I think -- there's -- there's always going to be, like, a bad apple in the bunch, you know.  Like, -- I've -- I -- I definitely heard of situations where ... some teachers, [SIGH] ah, just really didn't care or they -- they really, like -- they really didn't take the students very seriously and they -- they kind of ended up hurting the students, you know, [NOISE] [SIGH] a lot of the times.  [NOISE]  Ah, how about yourself?
L:  Yes, I agree with you --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, it's more or less like some of them are there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just to g- get their pay check, ah, [SIGH] they're not really concerned with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- whether or not the c- children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are learning, you know, what they need to learn.
R:  [NOISE]  R- right.  Like, ma- ma- may -- maybe the -- the credential programs should be a little more strict as well, in order to receive a teaching credential.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, like, maybe there should be more ... volunteer experience.  Maybe there should be more [SIGH] time devoted to actually ... learning, you know, to, like, learning how to teach [SIGH] fully, you know.  [SIGH]  Like -- like, maybe it should be a tougher program.   [MN]
L:  Y- yeah and, ah, they should really be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dedicated [NOISE] [SIGH] to it just like, ah, a doctor or, ... you know, a surgeon, you know, in -- in general.  [SIGH]
R:  I've --
L:  You know, someone that really ... has the desire ... you know, to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do what you know they are s- supposed to be doing.
R:  Absolutely.  [SIGH]  I totally agree.  [SIGH]  I think they -- they've got to be really passionate about teaching in order to be able to put up with the hardships that it entails.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know, 'cause I think it really can be, -- ah, can be a tough position I think.  [SIGH]  You know, it can be, ah -- it can be difficult, like, you have to put up with a lot of parents, you have to put up with a lot of -- [SIGH] a lot of disciplinary stuff in the school and I'm sure it could wear you down, you know.  [SIGH]  But, ah, I --
L:  Well, it's just like in anything else.  [SIGH]  In other things it takes a special --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- type person to do, ah, certain things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it ta- -- and in my opinion --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] it takes a special person to be a teacher because you've got to have patience and, ah, [NOISE] be understanding [SIGH] because I mean, you know, you're gonna have some, ... ah, [SIGH] ideal students and then you're going to have some that are, you know, just going to try your patience.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know, just 'cause you, as far as, ah, [SIGH] you know, they could --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- possibly, y- you know, that you allow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'em to.  More or less just like being a parent.  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  [NOISE]  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  [COUGH]  I'm a -- I'm not actually a parent myself yet but [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ... I definitely feel that I put e- every grey hair in my parents' head, that's for sure.  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] [SIGH] you know,
L:  Well I see -- I see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, through my own [SIGH] you know, it -- it brings you -- you know, when you do have children of your own you'll remember, [SIGH] a- ah, everything that y- you've put them through when your -- your child puts you through the same thing.
R:  Yeah, it's all a big circle.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Y- y- yeah.  [SIGH]  But, ah, -- a- actually I think ... being a product of -- of a lot of public schooling, like, I -- I did public elementary school and then when I got older my parents put me in a Catholic high school, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because -- because they didn't like t- the local public schools that we had nearby, [SIGH] and I did notice a big difference in -- t- the private school.  [SIGH]  Like no -- not actually because it was Catholic but just because it -- it was m- more, [SIGH] like, a lot of the teachers that were there c- cared about the students as individuals --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] a lot and they r- really, like, tried to help you if you were having problems and they were really, -- like, it was a lot more individualized [SIGH] you know.  And, ah, the school was pretty big, it wasn't a -- it wasn't, you know, [SIGH] that it was like really small, like, they had that m- much attention, [SIGH] you know.  But it -- it was basically, [SIGH] I -- I feel like the people there were different.  [SIGH]  And I just kind of wished that that could kind of flood over more into the public system.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, do you think that might --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- have a -- a lot to do with, ah, having God in it?
R:  W- well, ah, it's --
L:  You know, I mean --
R:  -- it's p- possible.  It -- it may not necessarily just be God it may just be [SIGH] the fact that i- it's -- like, ah, Catholics are b- brought up with a lot of ethics, [SIGH] you know, like, a lot of humanitarian respect, a lot of rights, a lot of [SIGH] serving -- you know, like -- like a lot of service, things like that.  [SIGH]  And I mean G- God is definitely a part of all that but --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I think just the fact that they are more sensitive to human needs, in general, I think.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Like, a lot of religious people are -- are -- a lot of religious and spiritual people are a little more, like, [SIGH] willing to -- to look and see the fact that [SIGH] somebody needs help and they're willing to, like, step in ... to the situation and really try and make a difference for -- for --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- the better, you know.  [SIGH]  So, I mean -- I'm -- I'm actually not religious myself but -- but growing up in that kind of a -- of an upbringing I -- I saw a lot of that [SIGH] and I really appreciated it.  And I think -- I -- I like to hope I picked up so- -- picked up some of it but [LAUGH] you know.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, it's just like in anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not only school but, ah, you're asking for trouble --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I myself am a religious person and, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everyone's entitled to their own believes and, you know, how they live their lives [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but in my experiences, a- ah, you're a whole lot better off --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to include God because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when you don't ... include God [SIGH] you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, you're just asking for problems.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I think that's why the school system, [SIGH] ah, the public school system is in the shape that it's in now is because they -- they want to, [SIGH] you know, they've got this crazy idea --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that they want to, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they -- they say they want to give [SIGH] a -- a choice --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but really it's not a choice, ah, they don't -- they're just trying to put God out of it, in my opinion.
R:  [NOISE]  I see.  [MN]  Yeah, well I -- I feel like a -- it -- it's -- I feel that -- I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's better to not have it in the schools just simply because [SIGH] like, there's so many different religions, there's so many different opinions.  [SIGH]  And, like, Ca- Catholicism or, like, Christianity isn't necessarily the biggest [SIGH] on the planet even, you know.  And so it's not even really like, I -- I as far as on -- on a global scale it's not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even really a majority opinion [SIGH] of -- of what's out there.  [SIGH]  And so I think it -- it is sort of a matter of respect for everybody else [SIGH] to not really have it.  Although -- [SIGH] or if they have it they shouldn't force it, but at the same [COUGH] --
L:  But that's they're -- they're right I think they should have a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- few moments --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- ah, of silence, or whatever, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, ah, if they want to, you know, the ones that want to pray, [SIGH] ah, have a right to do so but --
R:  We -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- the ones that don't want to then they could get up and leave the room.
R:  Well, [several inaudible words] a moment at the beginning of -- of, like, prayer or -- and they said, you know, "We know a lot of people at the school aren't necessarily Catholic and so for you -- you just have silence, a moment of calm, you know, a moment of meditation or whatever you want it to be".  [SIGH]  And it's [several inaudible words] and focus everyone [SIGH] and really -- and really kind of, like, calm down the [SIGH] -- the mood -- coming out from out [several inaudible words] and come in and actually sit down and gather yourselves, [SIGH] you know, so I -- I think it definitely was helpful.  [SIGH]  And, ah, I think -- I would love to see that in -- in public -- public school systems.  I think that would be great.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Myself, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But, you know ... getting back -- well, that had a lot to do with what we were talking about but, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that too [SIGH] I think that plays a big part in, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --how the teachers conduct themselves is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, a lot of their own beliefs themselves.
R:  [NOISE]  True.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Because, ah, I know when I were -- was going to school [SIGH] it was a lot different, I mean, y- you -- times have changed --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  -- so much and it all goes back --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to whether you're God fearing or not.  I mean, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] a- ah, it just seemed like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean I'm thirty eight and it just seemed like when I was growing up people, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- ah had more respect --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I mean w- when I was in school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, they were allowed to discipline the children, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they were allowed --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- to paddle them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, ah, [SIGH] -- and I think that was the biggest mistake in the world is taking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that out of schools.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Because you -- you have these kids [SIGH] that, ah, you know, they know that, ah, they're not going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have anything done to them [SIGH] and, ah, [SIGH] y- you know, they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they get by with murder.  But whereas when I went --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean that prevented a lot of us [SIGH] from doing a lot of things that we would've normally done, because we knew we were going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get our bottoms dusted.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  And my own children, ah, when my oldest one -- [SIGH] he started school paddling was still --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- allowed in school.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He's twenty one [SIGH] and, ah, y- you know, I told them, "By all means --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- ah, discipline him, because, you know, he's your responsibility --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- while he's here".  [SIGH]  But then as my youngest one s- started in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, ah, that's when, ah, [SIGH] you know, it came to pass after a
