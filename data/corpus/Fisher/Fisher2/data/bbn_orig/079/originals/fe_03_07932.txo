R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hey, there's actually somebody here this time.  Nothing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [inaudible].  The last time I was all by myself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, that's not good.
R:  It was lonely and it was awful.  It was like bioterrorism or something.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  It was like how do you talk about that?  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- I don't know.  I think that's why nobody else was on the other line.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Anyway, my name is Terry.
R:  Hi, Terry.
L:  I'm from New Hampshire.  And you?
R:  Uh, my name is Katie.  I'm in Tampa.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, do you have children in school?
R:  [PAUSE] No, I don't.
L:  You don't.  Um, well I do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you?
L:  Well, I have that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, she's, uh, starting second grade this fall.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, fun.  That's --
L:  And, uh --
R:  -- a fun age.
L:  Yeah, and, yes, I do think there's something seriously wrong with the public school system.
R:  I think there is too.  Both of my boys were in public school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- and don't get me wrong.  I liked sending them there.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, but th- uh, but it needs help.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  It needs big help.  The teachers aren't getting paid enough and --
L:  That's for sure.
R:  -- I -- I -- I see huge wastes of money.
L:  Uh, I get terrible static on my line here.  [NOISE] Help, no, that's not any better.  I don't know --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- if I'm gonna be able to continue this.  I can't get rid of the static. 
R:  Uh-oh.
L:  [NOISE] No, it's [NOISE] -- 
R:  I can -- 
L:  Hmm.
R:  -- I can barely hear it.
L:  Okay, well, that's a little better.
R:  Oh, okay.  Good.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Is it gone?
L:  I think so, yeah.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  I changed the, um -- the channel on the -- on the cordless so ...  Um, yeah, I, um, you know, pulled my oldest daughter out --
R:  Out.
L:  -- of public school for three years.
R:  Did you really?
L:  Yeah.  Because, er, they were just not meeting her needs.  [NOISE] And, you know, I don't know, public -- I don't know.  It's -- I -- I don't know if it's peer pressure or, um, I -- I -- like I said I do agree with the teachers do not get paid nearly enough, [NOISE] you know.  Hold on.  I'm gonna switch to the other phone.  See if it's --
R:  It's me.  
L:  -- better.
R:  It's me.  Is that better.
L:  [NOISE] It's not you, honey.  It's me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is it?  [LAUGH]
L:  I switched -- I have, uh, two cordless.  One of them [NOISE] seems to be picking [NOISE] up [NOISE] static.
R:  I thought it must --
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- be me because we're having a storm here.
L:  We d- -- we had thunderstorms today too.  [SIGH] So [NOISE] -- so, yeah, um, it -- it's a shame that, you know, uh, you know, we pay sports figures astronomical amounts to entertain us but yet the people who are responsible for our children can't make a living.
R:  That's true.
L:  Can't pay their bills.
R:  That's true.
L:  You know, and they're -- they're having to buy supplies out of their own pocket.
R:  Well, see, that's -- I know that to be a fact too --
L:  I do too.
R:  -- because th- --
L:  I have a, um -- I went to college to become a teacher, in fact.
R:  Did you really?  
L:  Yeah.  And I --
R:  My niece is --
L:  -- decided --
R:  -- getting ready to start teaching.
L:  Yeah, I decided, well, I'm -- during my senior year of college I got pregnant and I decided I'd stay home with my g- with my daughter.
R:  Good --
L:  Instead.
R:  -- idea.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good idea.
L:  So, I decided that that was a better option but, um -- so I -- I'm aware of -- you know, I mean, it's just -- it's ridiculous.  You know, they have to take -- you know, "Let's go buy paper".  I mean, the school can't even --
R:  Well --
L:  You know.
R:  -- I don't like the way they have them teaching to the test.  I don't know how they do it up there but we have the standardized test down here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they spend an absolutely ungodly amount of time teaching the kids how to pass that test.  And it absolutely infuriates me.
L:  Wow.
R:  Um, my son -- my youngest --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- son missed two weeks of school after a bicycle accident --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when he went back, it was the week of testing and because he had not been there the week before to be taught how to pass the test, they refused to let him take it.  
L:  See, I always thought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- those tests were supposed to test how well they're been taught on a general basis.
R:  In general.  Exactly.
L:  Of what they know.
R:  But that's not -- 
L:  What they know.
R:  In Florida, that's not what they do.  What they do is if the school doesn't have a certain --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- percentage of kids that pass the test, they're g --
L:  So, they make sure they do.
R:  -- the -- the school itself is graded --
L:  Yeh.
R:  -- and they --
L:  They lose funding.
R:  -- lose funding.
L:  They lose funding.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeh.
R:  So, yeah, and they refused to let him take the test.  So, one week of my son's school was [MN] hanging out and being a teacher's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- assistant because they did not want him taking the test.  This a gifted -- 
L:  'Cause he might --
R:  -- child.
L:  -- mess with their ratings.
R:  A -- a gifted child.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  He could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have passed the test with flying --
L:  See --
R:  -- colors.
L:  -- I think -- I think that most school systems are find for the normal child.  But if you have a gifted child, forget it.  They're bored.
R:  Uh-huh.  I ran into --
L:  And if you --
R:  -- that with my eldest.
L:  -- have a child with special needs, it's very difficult to have them met when there's thirty kids and one teacher.
R:  I agree.
L:  You know, I mean, it's ridiculous.
R:  I agree.
L:  I don't know what can be done obviously.
R:  Well, I pulled my oldest out for a year and home schooled him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that was a -- a bussing concern.  Because, er, when there's a school, you know, a mile from my house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they wanna bus him, you know, fifteen miles away --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- then I have an issue with that.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  So, I home schooled him for that year and then put him back in public school the following year.
L:  Well, I know my daughter she's, uh, sixteen.  She's going back to public school for her junior and senior year because she wants to go to college and we wanna make sure that she has access to scholarships and -- and everything that she needs.
R:  Right.
L:  So, she is going back.  But she's gonna have to get on that bus at like, I don't know, seven oclock in the morning and --
R:  Well, my --
L:  -- school doesn't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- start 'til eight.
R:  Well, my youngest --
L:  And the --
R:  -- son --
L:  -- school is five minutes up the road.
R:  Oh, th- --
L:  You know?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the school -- school here starts at seven oh five.
L:  Wow, that's early.
R:  Seven oh five.  So, he has to be -- [SIGH] had to be at the bus stop [MN] just after six oclock.
L:  That's ridiculous.  These poor babies are not getting enough sleep.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, I mean school's -- that's way too early.
R:  I think it's way too early.
L:  And what time does he get home?
R:  Well, [SIGH] [MN] --
L:  What time?
R:  We lost him last year.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.
R:  He was fifteen.  [SIGH]
L:  I'm sorry to hear that.
R:  But he used to get home at three thirty.
L:  See, seven -- seven oclock to three thirty is ridiculous.
R:  [NOISE] It is too long of the day.  I never understood why the schools had to keep them so long.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when my sons went to kindergarten, I used to just sit home and cry, thinking, "Why do they need them there all day long?"  That's too long for somebody that's --
L:  It is.
R:  -- five years old.
L:  It is.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It is.  It's way too long.  We have half day kindergarten here which --
R:  We don't.  
L:  -- seems to work --
R:  We --
L:  -- very well.
R:  We have all day kindergarten.  They're from eight to two.  That's a long time.
L:  Wow, yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  My daughter went the afternoons.  She was like, uh -- she had to be there at twelve thir- -- at twelve or so and she was home by three.  So, that wasn't bad.  That was --
R:  That's not too bad.  [SIGH]
L:  No, that was a nice introduction to school, you know.  And she really did enjoy it.
R:  I wish they would do that here.  I just think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's, you know -- a whole day --
L:  Well, we didn't even have --
R:  -- is too long.
L:  -- public kindergarten until a few years ago.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You had to pay for it. 
R:  Ah.
L:  My oldest d- never went to kindergarten.  She didn't need it.  Child was writing when she was two so she could write --
R:  Well --
L:  -- her name, you know.
R:  -- you know what?  I think people put too much emphasis when they're little like that.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH] I do.  I mean, now in the grand scheme of things.  You know, by the way things have turned out for me, it really doesn't make any difference.  You know, when you're all grown up, nobody's gonna say, [SIGH] "When you went to kindergarten, did you already know how to write? --"
L:  Right.
R:  "And did you already know how to read?"  It isn't gonna matter.
L:  No.
R:  As long as you know how to write and read now.
L:  [LAUGH] Right. 
R:  [LAUGH] You know what I mean?
L:  Right, right.
R:  So, that's what -- that's what [MN] is more important.
L:  I think it just -- I don't know what -- w- where.  I know that one of the problems is that the schools need more funding.  You know, they need more money.  Because then they could pay m- -- the teachers more.  They could get more teachers so the classrooms would be smaller.
R:  Well, I --
L:  They would have --
R:  -- would just like to s- --
L:  -- the supplies that they need.  But where are we going to get the funding?
R:  I -- I think they need to quit wasting the money in other areas because I have to tell you, I see it down here.  I see it big.
L:  Really?
R:  I do and I think one of the biggest wastes is -- is b- bussing the kids all over creation.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  You know --
L:  I mean, if there's a school --
R:  -- my youngest son --
L:  -- right down the road.
R:  -- went to [MN] uh, an elementary school and then he went to a different school for sixth grade and a different school for seventh grade and a different school for eighth grade --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- before he got to high school.
L:  Wow.
R:  And -- and -- and it's ridiculous.  It's just ridiculous to do them that way.  [SIGH] 
L:  That is.
R:  I don't like it.  I think it's stupid.
L:  Well, well, another thing.  They don't get used to being, you know?
R:  I know.  They change the group of people they're with.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  They change the school.  They're always changing the boundaries so they're changing the schools they go to.  [SIGH] I just think it's a bad idea.  But that and the testing --
L:  I mean I remember going to school --
R:  -- that's my big sticking point.
L:  -- starting first grade and graduating with the same group of kids that I started --
R:  I know.
L:  -- first grade with.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  We used to ride the same bus.  Ju- -- you know, the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- elementary, junior high and high school.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  All rode the same bus.
L:  Absolutely.  
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Although, I kind of, nowadays, think that it's a good idea not to have them do that because [LIPSMACK] you take a child --
R:  'Cause --
L:  -- that's in first or second grade, uh, and they don't need to hear what the teenagers have to say.
R:  Well, that's true.  Times have changed.
L:  Things have changed a lot.  You know --
R:  Kids that age --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- can be, you know --
L:  Yeah, and they don't --
R:  -- into all kinds of things.
L:  -- "Oh, my goodness, there's little ears around".  They think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Well, mom can't hear me so I can say whatever I wanna say now".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  So -- but they don't think --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- of what that's teaching these younger kids that don't understand.  Not that even the teenagers, uh, really understand what they're talking about.  They think they do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I would like to see them d- r- revamp the testing issue.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I would definitely like to see them increase the funding.  In other countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, Japan in particular, uh, their schools are funded.  Heavily funded.
L:  Mm.
R:  And they turn out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- exceptional.
L:  Oh, yeah.
