R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hello.
R:  This is a strange question, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Th- that's a tough one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- let's see, my name is Janet.
R:  Hi Janet.  I'm Dena.
L:  Dena?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  You too.
L:  Um, so -- so, this is, um, a benefactor will give you a million dollars if you --
R:  If you --
L:  -- promise never --
R:  -- never to talk to your best friend again.
L:  Hm.  [LAUGH]
R:  Tough one, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Well, what would you do?
R:  Um, I probably wouldn't take the money 'cause I think best friends are really hard to come by --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, I know a lot of people that have a lot of money and aren't happy.  So, I don't think that money can buy happiness, although a million dollars would be great, if it's your best friend, you know ... I don't know, you sound like you'll leave your best friend, what do you want to do?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You're like, "Screw my friend".
L:  Oh.  Oh, I think my best friend would understand, but, no, I don't -- I don't think I could do it either, oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A million dollars is just a million dollars I guess.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- money's great, but I know in --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- times of need all I have is my friends really.
L:  Yeah, friends are definitely more important than money, and, ah, you know, and -- and when you -- I mean, when they say an anonymous benefactor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that's just -- money's better when you work to get it, you know, if you --
R:  Yeah, I would take it if someone just give it to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have no problem in taking that.
L:  Oh, but without a stipulation, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- well --
R:  You know, and I'm not just saying it too to be like a good -- you know, try to be a good person, no, I would keep my friend, but I just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- think that friends are really ... really tough to come by.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  It's hard to find a -- you know, a good, dedicated, loyal friend --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they're very few and far between.
R:  That's for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What -- what, um, state are you in?
L:  Kentucky.
R:  Oh, Kentucky.  I'm in California.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, they connect us to all over the country.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.  This is pretty -- pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Did you get this from the money and shopping web site?
L:  Yes I did.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Yes, I love it.  [LAUGH]
R:  I just started -- I just started using them but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have you gotten a lot of work from that web site?
L:  Oh, just a couple of restaurants.  I haven't really had time to -- to do much with it.  I'm a -- I'm a registered nurse.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, so, and I -- I work the night shift mostly --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I've got a -- a five year old and a ten --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- year old, and it's kind of something I was, you know, do- doing for them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so that we can, you know, do it together.
R:  Yeah, and take -- you could take them to the restaurants and they probably feed -- give you food or, ah, money for like two people or something, right?
L:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, and then there's like day care, shops and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- different stuff like that.  I haven't -- I haven't done any, you know, I just -- I haven't been with it too long --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's pretty interesting.  [LIPSMACK] There's been a few things come through, but, you know, I haven't had the chance to do it too much.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, are -- are we supposed to talk about this million dollar thing for [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  -- for the whole eight minutes, I think we're supposed to [NOISE] --
R:  I guess, yeah.  I don't know.  So, um, I don't know, what would you do if you took the million dollars?
L:  Wow.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, it's a tough one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably give it to my best friend.  No, um, I don't know -- I don't know.  There's probably a lot of things.  I think I'd like to travel.
R:  Mhm.  Or the -- the other option is, is you could take the money and then how's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the other guy going to find out if you talk to the friend?
L:  Hm, now what --
R:  How is th- the guy who gave you the money --
L:  Know if you talk [LAUGH] --
R:  -- how would he find out -- huh?
L:  -- yeah, really, he'd never know, right?
R:  He'd never know, so you know what, I take my answer back, I'd take the money and I'd take my friend out [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and go shopping --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause he's never going to find out.
L:  Yeah, because that just seems like a really bizarre thing to do; give somebody a million dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for not talking to their best friend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Huh.
R:  And there's no way for them to monitor that, so, unless they like put the government agencies on you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they spend money hiring private eyes.
L:  Yeah, and what could they do once the money's spent?  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  Not much.  [LAUGH] Unless they like come after you and, who knows, these crazy people.
L:  You're right, that does sound -- that does sound crazy, because then, once you speak to 'em, what are they going to do, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] oh ... [LIPSMACK] well, that's kind of a crazy topic.
R:  Interesting.  I called yesterday too.
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah --
L:  W- what was your --
R:  -- three -- three days you can call.
L:  Huh?
R:  Three days in a row you can call.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, the topic yesterday was, ah -- was if you could go back in time and change something, what would it be?
L:  Oh.
R:  So, they're in- -- they're interesting.
L:  Yeah, that would be, you know, I guess that'd be in- --
R:  They kind of make you think, these questions, you know, they're almost like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's a moral behind them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Friend or money.
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, if you could go back what would you change, that kind of, ah --
L:  In your own life or in history?  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH]
R:  Well, in both, but I don't know.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, it's probably almost ten minutes now too.
L:  Yeah, when do you know --
R:  I --
L:  -- when do you know when to stop?
R:  They -- the recording will come on and tell us, you know.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  But I wasn't -- I forgot to watch the clock, so, it's probably almost.
L:  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] well [SIGH] --
R:  So, you would go on vacation with the money?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I believe I would travel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Take my kids traveling.
R:  And what -- where would you go?
L:  Well, I went to Australia about, well, in nineteen eighty seven --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with my aunt and uncle, and it was fantastic and I'd -- I'd love to be able to take my kids to Australia.
R:  Mhm, it's supposed to be gorgeous --
L:  So --
R:  The, ah -- did you see like a lot of kangaroos?  Are they all over?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I think of when I think of it.
L:  Yeah, kangaroos are neat; they're like big dogs really.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, and the people are so nice.
R:  Was there a l- -- I heard there's a lot of snakes there too though.
L:  Um, snakes?
R:  That's what I heard.
L:  Well, I mean, I didn't see a lot of snakes.  I wasn't really at where the snakes were --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, ah, do you watch crocodile hunter?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, that's a funny show.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, my kids like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you have any kids?
R:  Not yet -- not yet.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm still young.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, never know, maybe next year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I play -- I -- I started going to that web site 'cause I wanted to, you know, see what kind of things they have for at home mom kind of jobs --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and um, it's -- I think it's a great web site, that they actually have some stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I -- you have to -- I think there's a lot of people going out for it, so you almost have to -- almost fight for --
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  -- for the jobs, like --
L:  Yeah, there's a --
R:  -- get the -- get your email there first or --
L:  Yeah, there was a couple that I said, "Oh, I'll take that", and they're like, "Oh, we've already given it out".  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
R:  You know, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I'm trying to figure out where to go for vacation this summer.
L:  Hm.
R:  And if I had a million dollars [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would go to Tahiti.
L:  Oh, that would be nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Away from it all.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, Tahiti would be nice.  And you know where I think would be nice?
R:  Where?
L:  Easter Island.  [LAUGH]
R:  I've heard of that, but I don't even know where it is.
L:  Well, I think it's somewhere out there toward Tahiti, but it's, ah -- it's where they have those great big huge statues --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of the big faces.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Those big tall statues.
R:  The, um --
L:  [MN] 
R:  Mount Rushmore?
L:  Um, no they're -- they're just giant, um, stone faces on this island.  It's an unin- -- it was an uninhabited island.  They don't know who was there that built them and who --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- you know, and they're, like, native looking, like Polynesian looking --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, ah, I think there would be interesting to see.
R:  Definitely.
L:  You know, [LAUGH] sort of like Stonehenge or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, just where nobody knows how it got there.
