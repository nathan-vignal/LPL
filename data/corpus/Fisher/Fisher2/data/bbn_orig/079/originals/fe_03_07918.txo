L:  Hi.
R:  Hi there.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Go ahead.
L:  I'm Dee.  H- --
R:  What is your name?
L:  Dee.  What's yours?
R:  Christa.
L:  Christa.  Oh, okay.  What was the qu- the question again now?
R:  [COUGH] If an unknown benefactor was to get you a m- -- give you million dollars and for you to never to speak to your friend again, would you do it?  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] Interesting question, huh?
L:  Yeah, it is a interesting question.  
R:  [inaudible]
L:  To never talk to your best friend again.  I -- I would be so suspicious anyway.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh --
L:  I would go like, "Who would pay me not to talk to my best [LAUGH] friend?"  
R:  Right, the motives behind it.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  [MN] I would do it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Would ya?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  I moved four hundred and fifty miles away from home now.  Uh, so I hardly ever get to see my friends anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where I am.
L:  Yeah, I don't think I have any best friends right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well staying --
L:  I probably would do it too just 'cause I don't have any.  [LAUGH]
R:  There you go.  And a million dollars, you could make a best --
L:  And I mean --
R:  -- friend.
L:  -- that should make some friends, huh?
R:  There you go.
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you living at now that you're -- 
R:  I live in --
L:  -- so far away?
R:  I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, Wisconsin.  
R:  Mhm.
L: Oh, wow.  I'm in Idaho.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Oh, wow, way over there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  A few miles difference.
L:  Oh, gosh.  So, [several inaudible words] loose so far away from home for with all your friends?
R:  I got married.
L:  Oh, did ya?
R:  Yeah, I used to live in Michigan and so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- now --
L:  See that's where I draw the line. 'Cause see, I -- I -- I don't have everyone left except my husband.  So, I would think that that would mean my husband.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I kept thinking.  It's like, "Whoa, my best friend is only, er -- my husband's the only one I've got left" so, you know.
R:  Right.  
L:  But I --
R:  Now I --
L:  -- just got married too, but, you know.
R:  Oh, did you?  So did I --
L:  [MN] [MN]
R:  -- last --
L:  Yeah, not --
R:  -- fall.
L:  -- not too long ago anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah.
R:  How long have you been married?
L:  We're going on our anniversary is this next month.  And we're going on two years now.
R:  Really?
L:  So, how long is it for you?
R:  Um, it'll be a year in September.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you moved where he was?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, he's got all his friends still.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, he does.  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, wait a minute.  This is not fair.  Uh, although you're the one getting the money so that's not such a bad deal.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It's okay.
L:  That's funny.  Well, I live in a really small community where my, um -- the man I married was -- was one of our friends.
R:  Oh.
L:  [MN] my ex husband's friends and so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- now his friends won't talk to me anymore so I'm just -- like I said, I'm down to where I don't have any friends any more except my husband so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, it's like, "Okay, fine" and we're in such a small town, it's like everybody knows everybody's business.
R:  Right.
L:  So we're to the point now when, you know.  Not that we don't have too many really close friends.  We haven't made any really, really close friends any more so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I probably would go along with it as long as it didn't mean my husband.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think --
R:  I --
L:  -- that would be harder.
R:  That -- that would be terrible.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can't imagine not having my husband.
L:  Say, "I'll give you a million dollars if you'll divorce your husband and never talk to him again".  Now that would be hard.
R:  U- u- unless --
L:  I don't think I could handle that.
R:  -- you're getting ready to have a divorce anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If you're already headed that way, yeah, that would be great, you know --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- like but ... Yeah, that would be hard so ...
R:  At my last divorce I ended up having to pay to get out of it.
L:  Did you really?
R:  Yeah, I paid my ex husband money to give me a divorce.
L:  You're kidding?  How did --
R:  No.
L:  -- you do that?
R:  My divorce was twenty three months long.  [NOISE]
L:  You're k- --
R:  It was a battle in itself.
L:  Oh, man.  And I thought mine was bad.
R:  Yeah, no, so I paid that fool to get out.  [LAUGH]
L:  That is just nuts.
R:  Disgusting is wh- --
L:  What city -- I mean, what state where you living in at that time?
R:  I was out in, um, Michigan.
L:  In Michigan?  And you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ended up have to go all through that?  D- d- do they have a no fault divorce thing or do you have to like have a reason?
R:  No, they had no fault I think.  I don't know.  Man, I paid a lawyer.  It cost me close to twenty thousand dollars to get my divorce.
L:  Oh, you're kidding.  Do you have any kids?
R:  I have one.  I have a child that I adopted.
L:  Really?
R:  [MN] That was part of the scenario of it.  Why it took so long.  I had him removed from the adoption papers.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, you see ...
L:  I didn't know you could do that.
R:  Well, you really can't.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um, there was enough evidence behind him for abuse and everything.
L:  Really?
R:  That, uh, we were able to do it, yep.
L:  Yeah, see I have a child that was mine and then -- from another marriage and it was kinda a [MN] crazy thing but I ended up with a daughter that was d- adopted by my new husband at the time and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- now that we're divorced, he has custody of her part of -- a part of the custody.  You know, this joint custody but she has to go see him even though he's not really her Dad.
R:  What?
L:  And she doesn't wanna go 'cause she's twelve and she's like, "I don't wanna go see him.  He's not even my dad".  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm like, "Well, I know.  But he adopted you".  So, [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, here he is, not even her dad but she has to go for a visitation and he has to pay child support --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on her so that's just nuts.  You know, it's like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, I understand the logistics of it but still it's kinda crazy to make a twelve year old go to see someone she doesn't wanna see anymore.
R:  I agree.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  I agree.  My --
L:  Kind of crazy.
R:  -- my, uh, new husband here.  He has paid child support for almost twelve years and has not seen th- the child support's over.  The kids have grown and it's been, uh two years he hasn't had a pay.  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the children are all grown up and have not seen him in twelve years.  And the son called me.  They live like two thousand miles away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the son asked if he could come this weekend to come surprise his dad for his --
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- birthday.  He's leaving at five oclock in the morning from Washington State.
L:  That's gonna be a shock for your husband.
R:  Yeah.  He hasn't seen --
L:  Good.
R:  -- them so I have been cleaning house, getting things prepared, everything's --
L:  And --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- then the phone rings and they go, "You wanna talk?" right? 
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  And you're like, "Oh, no, not now".  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I'll make a dollar.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well that's kind of the way I feel about it although I haven't seen any money yet.  I keep thinking, "Well, you know, I guess if this works [LAUGH] out" you know.
R:  Yeah, I -- I haven't gotten a dime either.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Now --
L:  Yeah, I wonder --
R:  I wonder I --
L:  -- wh- -- I wonder if they're just waiting for the whole, um, survey I guess thing to w- end.
R:  I d- --
L:  What is it?  It's like a --
R:  I don't know.  I've had friends who've gotten paid already from it.
L:  Have you really?
R:  So ... Yep.
L:  From the same program?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  Hm.
R:  So, I don't know what the deal is but [MN] --
L:  Maybe they just wait --
R:  -- and I think --
L:  -- 'til you get to a certain amount of calls.  'Cause I've only --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- done three.  This is only my third one.
R:  Yep, this is my third one also.
L:  Yeah, maybe that's what it is.  Maybe we d- -- you have to do like a certain amount.  Maybe there's three or five or something.  'Cause now --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- see I remember when I read the paper work it was three.  That they did three phone calls.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then you got thirty dollars 'cause you got ten dollars each or something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then, you know, that's all they were interested in was the three but they would do it -- and then it asked if you wanted to do more if you got the opportunity so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- maybe that's what it is.  But --
R:  O- oh.
L:  A- and they got this all, you know, taped.  I'm sure they're going to listen to us talking about getting --
R: You know.
L:  -- paid, you know?
R:  Well, you know --
L:  We're supposed to be talking about friends.  Well, anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  What I heard is what they're doing to -- I had a girlfriend.  She contacted the company that's doing this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And what it is that they're doing is they'll trying to get the dialects of people.  This is funded by the government, did you know that?
L:  Is it really?
R:  Yes, is it.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  And they're getting the dialects.  It's all going through a computer.  They don't listen to it.  See, we -- we --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we could talk about air pollution if you wanted to.
L:  Really?
R:  Um, there's gon- --
L:  Are they just trying to find out how we're -- how we're c- conversing.  Is that what the deal is or ...?
R:  Right.  They're getting the dialects, the -- the tone of voice, blah, blah, blah, blah, bunch -- it's a bunch of crap.  They're -- they're actually not even listening to the words that you speak.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yep.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Yep.  They -- they've done it in Japan already.  Uh, there was a thing such as this done in Japan.  And now they're paying us here.
L:  And they're trying to prove what?  What are they trying to ...?
R:  They're trying to prove how stupidly they can spend all of our money.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We'll pay you ten bucks to carry on a conversation that we don't --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- what for.  You know.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  That's probably true.
R:  I agree.
L:  That's interesting.
R:  Doesn't make much sense.  But I tell you, if they wanna pay me to do it, I'll do it.
L:  Yeah, well anything to make a couple of dollars when you're got kids and trying to get -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and trying to make it so ...
R:  Get my tax money back.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I keep wondering when mine's ever gonna get here.  I think they're getting slower and slower every year.
R:  You haven't got your tax refund --
L:  Huh-uh.
R:  -- yet?
L:  I still haven't.
R:  Oh, no way.
L:  Well, we have to p- file -- see my ex hu- -- my husband right now is also paying child support on children that are already grown, that he's never seen.
R:  Right.
L:  He's still paying back because she went back and got, uh, welfare --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in the state of California you have to help pay welfare back --
R:  No --
L:  -- if you're the ex husband.
R:  Oh, God.
L:  And so he's paying there.  His kids are twenty three and twenty five and he's still paying child support.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Because -- just to pay back the state anyway.  And so he's doing that and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's been a nightmare for us anyway but, you know?
R:  I can imagine.
L:  But ...
R:  Well my -- my husband's, uh, first wife.  She went a couple of years ago.  They've been divorced for fifteen, seventeen years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She went and put something in his name in, uh, a credit and then defaulted on it.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Never knew it was there.  We went and bought a house last year and they weren't going to give us the house.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Because of what she did.
L:  It's amazing what ex --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, spouses can do to your --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- credit and to everything else.
R:  So -- so then we paid to have it removed and we just went last week, bought a brand new car.  Thirty something grand to put down on a car.  They pull up the credit rating.  His credit rating score is low because that's still on there.  And we paid the people, the mortgage broker that did our house to get that eradicated from his, uh, whatever.
L:  That is crazy.
R:  And they didn't get the credit report and they didn't do it.
L:  Oh, that's -- 
R:  And w- --
L:  -- that's sad.
R:  Yep, and now we gotta go back to them and it's a laugh because we paid like two hundred and fifty dollars to have, um -- get that cleared up for him.
L:  [MN] 
R:  So ...
L:  Sounds like you guys are paying through the nose for everything right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Jeez.  What a great way to start a marriage, huh?
R:  Well, well --
L:  It's hard.
R:  -- we're good people.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It'll -- it'll happen -- a lot of prayer it'll work.
L:  Yeah, well, what else do you have, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Each --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- other.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's about it, too.  That's the way --
R:  You know --
L:  -- we are.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  What else can you do.  You know, we [MN] -- he gets two hundred dollars, you know, from his check right of the top just to pay for this thing for California and --
R:  How long is he gonna --
L:  My --
R:  -- pay that?  How many years on that does he have to pay?
L:  Well, it's -- last we heard there was like seven thousand dollars he still owed.  Can you imagine?  Seven thousand dollars when you've been paying all these years --
R:  Are they putting --
L:  -- and then your kids are that old.
R:  Are they putting taxes -- are they taxing it, interest penalties?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
