L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Holly.
R:  My name's Crystal.
L:  Nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
R:  You too.
L:  So we're --
R:  Okay, the topic, ah, she said was, um -- what, about public school systems and, ah --
L:  Is there something wrong with them.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, I feel that, ah, you know, since it is compared to private schools and even some charter schools that are public.  Um, 'cause, ah, some of the -- well, not only did they, um, let out, like, as far as the music programs and stuff like that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as far as, um, like in my area here there, um -- mostly the books and stuff that they have are mostly, um, like old.  I'm talking about like maybe four or five years old.
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH] And so, like, in -- like, if you go to, like, a -- a private school, you're probably going to get most of the -- you know, the latest text.  You know, it's not outdated.
L:  But do you -- do you necessarily think that's something that's wrong with the school or that sounds more like something that's wrong with the -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Government system not giving the schools --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- enough money.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I feel that's -- yeah, that is -- yeah, as far as the government not giving the schools enough money.
L:  Right.
R:  But the private schools, you know, that, um, it's private funded.
L:  Right.  But a lot of times in public schools you're going to find -- you can find better quality teachers in public schools because the teachers in public schools often are there because they really want to.  Because they're not getting paid any money, basically --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- versus the teachers in, um, private schools are getting paid normally, you know, a pretty hefty salary and you're not always going to get a teacher who's really enthused about what they're doing, so --
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true too.  But then exact- -- like, um [NOISE] like, I'm getting back to the schools, you know, that, um, my children go to.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you'll get some teachers who are, you know, good and they let -- you know, I'm saying and -- I'm not saying it's a rarity --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but then you get other ones who are upset, maybe angry, you know, because of the pay or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and are impatient, you know, with the students, ah, you know, fed up and a lot of 'em are leaving.
L:  Mhm.  Going to private schools?
R:  E- exactly.
L:  Okay, so what do you feel then about the -- the voucher system that they're starting to give out for, um, people who are going to public schools to start attending the private schools?  Do you think that's the way to go then?
R:  Well, I mean, have an option, yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  If you can have that option, you know, for -- for your child, you know?  I think, yeah, that is the way to go.  I mean, it's -- the Government's not going to do anything for 'em -- you know, for the school system.  At least have 'em here, like, having the chance, ah, like, especially if you're -- if you're, um, you know a parent who doesn't make that much money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who cannot afford to send their child to a -- a private school ordinarily, and having that opportunity, ah, chance to [NOISE] -- to get, you know, a voucher for 'em, you know?
L:  Right.  Well, and -- and I agree with you there.  But, you know, what I've seen happen most often is that whenever a district tries to enact some sort of small -- like a point five percent tax in order to improve the public schools --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- most of the time they get voted down because people don't want to pay that extra point five percent.  So you're running into the situation where, yeah, the public schools need some -- need some work and it's m- -- you know, ninety nine percent of the time because of money, but the community's not willing to put the money into it so you kind of have a vicious circle.  I mean, w- -- how are you going to improve something that the community complains about but they're not willing to pay for?
R:  Yeah, that's something go- -- I mean, you know, like as far as voting wise --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's makes sense.  Um, I know -- well, I -- I just moved from, ah, New Jersey and, ah [COUGH] in Inglewood they had charter schools --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that was the other option.  Even though what -- you know, was a -- a public school, you know, it's part of the public school system but it's -- it's privately owned, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they get funding from the Government.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, that was our other option.  And, ah, we had -- you know, they had votes because, um, the board of education was trying to, um, get rid of the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- charter schools in that area --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were vote- -- they were ousted.  They were voted out. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, so they kept the charter schools.
L:  Right.
R:  So there are people listening, but I don't know, like, in this area that I'm in now, you know?  I guess as far as the P.T.A. and all that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  We have to get more people out there to, um -- to recognize, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  To speak on it.
L:  Yeah.  Unfortunately I'm not very familiar with the public school system because my children go to -- we're military --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so my children go to military schools, um, or m- -- I should say military run schools.  And they get all the funding they need from the Government so, you know, I'm not completely familiar with how charter schools and all that different stuff works but I --
R:  It --
L:  -- definitely think that if they were to increase the teachers' pay and, um, maybe be a little more selective about who they're hiring.  'Cause I have often found that some of, like -- some of the teachers that they do hire, um, they are -- like you said, they're bitter because they're not getting the money and, ah, really have no place teaching our children. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  You're right.
L:  But, well, how would --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you fix it?  I mean, what would you propose --
R:  Well --
L:  -- to fix the problem?
R:  -- having -- having the opportunity to have, like you said, voucher programs.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Having char- -- a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- charter school or having, you know, ah, that's what the, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- charter schools came from.  Like, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- parents and, ah, public teachers being angered about the way the public school system's being run --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and opening up their own private ones.  You know, um, the charter schools.  You know, having the alternative, you know, to the -- you know, for people who -- for parents who couldn't afford private schools.
L:  But --
R:  But then they -- they wanted, um, their children to learn more --
L:  Right, but is that --
R:  -- then what they were.
L:  -- an option for -- for any school district to open up a charter school if they just -- are disgruntled with the way their school is going?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  That would be a -- you know, that would be --
L:  Is it expensive for the students or is it paid for?  You said it's paid for by --
R:  It's the government.
L:  -- by the government?  Uh-huh.
R:  It's run through the same way that they -- you know, like, ah, from the same way that they do through the public schools, you know, that the p- -- um, the charter school's going to get some of that.
L:  Right.  Then how come the par- -- the public schools can't be improved?  I mean, why -- why would the Government put all this money into a charter school when they could just as easily put it into a public school and raise it to the same level as the charter school?
R:  Yeah, that -- that makes [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that makes sense, but, like, um, like I said, the charter school, they start out, I mean, um, the charter school that my children were going to when we were in Inglewood, I mean, ah, there was only I'd say about -- I'd say maybe ten to twelve children to -- per class.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, and it started out -- they only started out like, ah, kindergarten and, ah, first and second grade.  And then before we had left it went all the way up to fifth.
L:  So it's expanding.
R:  Yeah.  And there are more -- I mean, there's all kinds of charter schools [LAUGH] cropping up all over the place, you know?
L:  And a charter school is basically not quite a public school but not quite a private school?
R:  Exactly.  It's an alternative --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I mean, if you -- I mean, that their focus -- the charter school focus is more on, ah, yeah, ah, more on, ah, the student, you know, the individual.  You know, more or less on the individual child.
L:  Right, but there --
R:  That's why they -- they believe in less, ah, you know, smaller class sizes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, being able to, um, like to focus more on the children, more of a one to one level.
L:  So they have a smaller student to teacher --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- ratio.
R:  And that's -- that's -- you know, because in public schools they -- they push -- I mean, I've know some, you know, like they'd push the children up.  You know, like after -- okay, they may leave 'em back one year, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  And then, ah -- [NOISE] then after a while they're -- you know, the children, like the one's that are maybe a little slow --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- learning, you know, have a slight learning disability or they feel that, um, you know, that they -- you know, that maybe that they gave up on 'em and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they'll just push 'em up, push 'em up, push 'em up.
L:  Right.  But are the charter schools accepted by colleges?  Are there -- is their education a little cept- -- accepted by colleges just the same as a public or a private school would be?
R:  Ah, yes they are. 
L:  Are they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- considered better?
R:  Like, in -- like I said there's -- we were transferred [NOISE] from, like, I -- I moved from, ah, Inglewood to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- here and, ah, yeah, it's [NOISE] the same effect.  My daughter -- I mean, her reading level [LAUGH] is much higher.  You know what I'm saying?  Because of the fact that she went to the charter school.
L:  Right. [NOISE]  And --
R:  Because she had the individual, um, like a little bit more individual attention.  Because they more focus -- they focus more on the, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the parent and teacher participation also.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause you were encouraged to come in the class anytime you wanted to.  And, ah --
L:  It --
R:  -- you were -- like, they also had it where --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- you had to give, you know, some time, you know, of a standard.  Like at least, ah, a couple of times a month where you had to come in and, ah, sit down with the class or whatever helped.
L:  Right.
R:  That was part of the curric- -- you know, that was part of the whole thing in order for them to go.
L:  Now the school --
R:  You know, we had --
L:  -- that your -- your children are in now, they don't encourage you to come in?
R:  [LAUGH] It's not the same, no.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's not the same.  I mean, we -- you know, we can come in -- you know, I can come in there and visit and sit down, you know, like [LAUGH] but I'm not going to be able to sit down in class.  If I come in there maybe you have to help make copies or just [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  They put you to work.
R:  You know what I'm saying it's -- it's so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so many chil- -- ah, teachers have left, I'm telling you. [LAUGH]  My -- my daughter's teacher there, she was good.  We -- we were lucky with her.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Um, she left after this year.  Another -- another child, my goddaughter, her, ah, teacher, right in the middle of the year quit because of, ah, what was going on within the school system.
L:  That doesn't seem fair to the children.
R:  No it's -- no it's not.  No.
L:  But I guess you have to see where they're coming from also.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, but, ah, you know, because of economic -- you know, I guess -- you know, because of the pay.
L:  Right.
R:  That's partially, but then on top of it they have, ah, the type of, ah, like the vice principal for instance and, ah, my child [NOISE] yeah, the vice principal that they put in [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Can you hear my daughter? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah, you know, that's -- that's --
