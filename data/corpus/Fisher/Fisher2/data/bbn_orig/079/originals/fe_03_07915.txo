L:  Hello, my name's Alexis.
R:  Hi Alexis, my name is Sue.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Where are you located?
L:  [NOISE] I am in Hood River, Oregon -- it's sixty miles west, or, actually east of Portland, Oregon. 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  A- and you are?
R:  In San Diego.
L:  [MN] [NOISE] All right, so, we're on the same side of the country.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, indeed.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, tough one --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah, interesting -- what would you do?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I don't think I -- I don't think I could take the money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have a -- I have a best friend who has been my best friend for thirty three years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah, I don't think you can buy that.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  So, I -- I [LAUGH] -- it would be very hard to turn down the check, [SIGH] but, I think --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I probably could not live with myself if I -- if I sold out my friend.
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] I find the question itself to be rather hard to swallow, um, [SIGH] I just [LAUGH] -- I don't know, I have a rather logical mind, and that kind of offer is not logical, so, therefore it kind of throws me for a loop.  I don't know, I, um -- I haven't had what I guess I would call a best friend for an extended period of time -- I've had best friends for, like, you know, ten years or something, but, [SIGH] not -- not -- [MN] you know, and it was off and on, and [MN] I don't know -- it's [LIPSMACK] -- I don't think I could take the money because my morals would step in the way of it, but -- morals as in  which do you place higher?  The value of friendship over money, rather than an actual person -- you know what I mean?  [MN] Um ...
R:  Well, I think we'd all like to think that we were honorable, and --
L:  [SIGH] E- exactly.
R:  -- could say,  "Yes --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  "-- I'm honorable, I wou-  I wouldn't take money" -- it's hard to tell what you'd really do. [LAUGH] 
L:  It is -- it is, I don't know -- my best friend right now happens t- -- my very best friend that -- that I just -- it happens to also be the person I'm thinking of spending the rest of my life with, and I just can't imagine not talking to him.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that would -- that wouldn't happen, but, at the same time, you know -- the other person I always thought was my best friend and, she's like, probably my best girlfriend, um -- we have a very understanding, but distant relationship [LAUGH] -- we can talk about --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- whatever, but, that's when we get the time, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, so, not talking to her really wouldn't be much different than right now.  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in that case, a million bucks -- looks pretty good.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, I don't know -- the question itself is -- I think is -- is just rather preposterous, but it --
R:  [inaudible] well --
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] it [inaudible] --
R:  -- it is and it isn't, I mean, if -- if you take it on the surface for what it is -- would you never speak to your best friend again, for a million bucks?  Yeah, that's kind of preposterous, but, I think it -- it gets to the underlying issue of where do you place value in life --
L:  True.
R:  -- is it in people, or, is it in things -- is it in finances, and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- as -- as an underlying value question --
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH]
R:  -- um, I think that it has some merit.
L:  Yeah, that's true, it's -- it's a simple materialistic kind of question, and I'm about as unmaterialistic as they come, you know?  My idea of a good bargain is what I can find in the dumpster, you know?  I go dumpster diving.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my -- [SIGH] well, I'm --
L:  I do, and it's amazing the stuff you can find.  [LAUGH]
R:  I am decidedly more materialistic than that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I get excited if I can find a good deal, and I guess maybe that's the -- the plus of it, and -- and I've actually just gone through a major change where I've taken a whole bunch of things out of my life that I didn't need -- I just decided, "Okay, do I need this?  Is this really necessary?", [SIGH] and, um [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [MN] -- so, that's -- that's kind of where I'm at, right now, so -- materialistic is not my bag.
R:  Mhm
L:  I don't think it ever has been, but --
R:  Well, that --
L:  -- even more so now.
R:  -- that makes it easier to turn down the money.  [LAUGH]
L:  It does, it does, but, m- me, I'm, you know, with a million bucks I could go a lot of places --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- imagine all the places -- see, that's my big thing -- is travelling, so [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- oh, boy, you know?  [LAUGH] I could make sure the world is round.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know, it, um -- do you think people are becoming more materialistic, than what they used to be?
R:  I think people are as materialistic as they ever have been.  I think more of them are saying they're not, because they can't afford to be anymore.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  But, um, I don't -- I don't think that people change that dramatically, um, [SIGH] so, yes, I believe people are materialistic.  I also tend to believe that friends are more disposable than they used to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think we have a society where we're communicating more indirectly, by email and by --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- voicemail and whatever, so that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, you know, [several inaudible words] people --
L:  So, we have these very flimsy, very intangible relationships that people are willing to just jump on, to try and find the tangible.
R:  Yes, and --
L:  I -- I think so, too.
R:  So --
L:  Although, I -- I think I would disagree with you on the -- [SIGH] on the materialistic [MN] -- corporations seem to be having this huge effect on people, and, I don't know -- I just kinda get the feeling maybe people are starting to catch on, but, there through the eighties it was just this huge growth that [SIGH] -- oh, I don't know -- I tend to --
R:  I don't know -- there's a reason why SUVs are the best selling --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- car around, and it's not because people have bigger families, and it's not because people are going camping more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's because they're expensive and trendy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  What's fashionable, and what's in.
R:  Mhm.  There's -- you know, [MN] there's a reason why they're selling knock offs of designer handbags -- because, people want designer handbags, whether they can afford them or not.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, I think --
L:  It's all about the look.
R:  I think people are every bit as materialistic as they ever have been, and they're finding -- you know, there's a reason why debt in America exceeds what it ever has been -- it's because people are materialistic in their spending.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  So, um, I think that this -- I think that this is a -- certainly a valid question for the times -- if we're spending less time with people, and we're still pursuing the same --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- or more material --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- ah, [MN] on material goods then I think the question has great validity.   I think, if I hadn't had a best friend -- a long standing, very good, very dear, very important best friend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then, I could look at it and say, "Huh, people are disposable, a million bucks is great -- go for it".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- while everybody may say, "No, I wouldn't do it", I think there are many people who probably would.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] [SIGH] It -- it also would provide a great subject for the next reality TV show.
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] 
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, everything else is about millionaires right now, so, [SIGH] why don't we just plug this one right up there and -- [LIPSMACK] you know, I'm sure Fox would love to broadcast it, and they can just follow people around to make sure that they stick to what they say they're gonna do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It would be interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It would be very interesting to see.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] They're taking everything else lately, I don't know -- [MN] I wouldn't -- I'm starting to wonder -- I wouldn't be too surprised.  [NOISE] 
R:  And, why do you suppose they're getting people to allow them to do that?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I think it's a simple fascination with watching other people, and -- it's like rubber neckers in an accident, you know?  They want to see the gore, but, yet they're afraid to see the gore.  People have a fascination with, um -- with the dark, and with the morbid, but, yet, our society is such a puritanical society in the same sense, they [inaudible] -- you know, "We wanna see it because we're not supposed to ...", but --
R:  Well, I guess --
L:  -- "Oh, but we're not supposed to see it ...", you know, it's just this -- it's this battle between ourselves -- I -- I don't seem to see other countries so much suf- -- well, Japanese have some really odd television shows --
R:  Yep, they do.
L:  -- but, um, [MN] you know -- [MN] I don't know, I just -- it seems like a lot of the things that happen in this country [SIGH] [MN] in, um -- in a social sense like that are -- are pitted like that -- one against the other in such a way that it -- it makes you feel guilty for watching it, but, yet it's like this luxurious, um, decadent pleasure that [MN] -- you're allowing yourself to do it, but, yet, "Oh man, I really don't want to", you know -- 
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- somebody asks you if you watch the show and you're ...
