R:  [NOISE]  Hi, my name is Fred.
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, my name is ... L- Linda.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Linda, How are you doing?
L:  [SIGH]  I'm doing okay, How about you?  [SIGH]
R:  Pretty good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thanks.
L:  [NOISE]  Good.  Where -- where do you live?  [SIGH]
R:  Princeton, Pennsylvania.  How about you
L:  Um, Eden Prairie, Minnesota.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, wow!  I didn't think the calls went this far.
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Yeah, we're at opposite ends.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess we're supposed to talk about schools, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  [SIGH]  How are the schools out there?
L:  Um, h- here Eden Prairie we've got, um, pretty much the best in the country.
R:  Good oh!
L:  Yep.
R:  Aroun- -- around here they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty good but I mean they could -- I think they could be -- our taxes are real high.  Do you pay property taxes, like school taxes?  Are there any school taxes out there?
L:  Are, yes, our taxes are extremely high --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- and most of it goes to the schools.  [SIGH]
R:  Probably -- is there a lot of drugs out there?
L:  [NOISE]  Um --
R:  Like in the schools and everything, violence, or no?
L:  T- there's d- drugs but it's not a -- a bad problem, --
R:  No, it's not --
L:  -- not like it is in some places.
R:  Yeah, ah, -- where you're phoning is it like a big city or is it a small city?
L:  I- it's a suburb of Minneapolis.
R:  Oh, so you're pretty close.  Where [SIGH] -- you're northeast Pennsylvania?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um, I haven't been there but ... I have --
R:  It's not --
L:  -- I know the basic area.
R:  -- it's -- it's s- starting to get -- it's starting to get bad around here.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, do you have children in school?
R:  No, not yet.  Me and my wife we're -- we're -- we just got married a couple of years ago and we're starting this year.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Um, I have, um, one that's a sophomore in high school and I have, [SIGH] ah, one that has his associate degree [SIGH] and he's going back to school for a- art degree.  [SIGH]
R:  Did they go -- did they both go to public schools or did they go to private schools?
L:  Um, public.
R:  Public schools?
L:  The Edenberry[?] schools here.
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] does the school year -- is -- what's your school year like there?
L:  [MN]  Um, [SIGH] they have a new program here where, um, the classes are, like, an hour and a half long.  [SIGH]  And they have [SIGH] -- so it's longer classes and fewer classes.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, that's pretty neat.
L:  And the, [NOISE] ... um, grade points have skyrocketed since they went on this program.  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  Because there's a lot more time to actually learn the subject.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And they have ... less homework because they have less classes [SIGH] and it's, ah, ... r- really helped.  [SIGH]
R:  See, around -- I'm not -- I'm not really familiar with the -- the school systems around here that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause I don't have kids in school yet.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I didn't go -- I didn't go to -- I went to a private school when I -- before we moved up here.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But, yeah, I'm pleased with, ah, [NOISE] ... schools here -- right here in Eden Prairie.  It -- it -- there's some areas of the twin cities that aren't as good [SIGH] but I think it's our exorbitant tax rate that --
R:  [SIGH]  Yes, [SIGH] very, v- very much.  I -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I -- I -- if I knew a little bit more about the curriculum I think I'd be able to support it a little bit more.
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  And then we have other programs that s- support the schools like, our, um, [SIGH] the Target Stores --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- g- give a percentage of their earnings [SIGH] to the various schools.  [SIGH]  And I think Eden Prairie school so far has gotten, like, forty thousand dollars --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- from Target.  [MN]  So, ...  [SIGH]
R:  See now they're -- they're just starting to build 'em around here.  Like the area that I'm in is just starting to build up just a little bit.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's -- it was always a real small -- a real small town but they're starting to build up and [SIGH] hopefully --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] in the state they're supposed to lower [SIGH] the school taxes and -- and do other taxes instead because they're just -- they're horrible but ... what you pay a month.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Even my -- like, my grandmother [SIGH] she [LAUGH] hasn't had a kid in school in forty years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she still pays like -- she still pays, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- almost fifteen hundred dollars a year in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- school taxes.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  It's the n- name of the game.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yep.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Boy, it's going to be hard to ta- talk about the schools for ten minutes, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Have you -- how long h- have you -- is this your -- how long have you been doing this -- with the calls from them?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, just like a week.  [SIGH]
R:  This is my first call.
L:  Maybe two weeks.  [SIGH]  Um, the last time, um, the other p- party wasn't there so -- [SIGH] I think they changed their mind after they said they'd do it.  [SIGH]
R:  Really -- I don't -- I mean it doesn't -- it doesn't seem bad.  It's just hard to talk about [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a topic that you're not really super familiar with.
L:  Yeah, but you -- you can do it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  You're doing it.
R:  [SIGH]  Now, my neighbor's a principal he seems to like the school system.  [SIGH]  Or the -- how are the --
L:  Ye- --
R:  -- teachers, -- ah, the teachers get paid like a r- real lot of money out there too?
L:  Um, no, it's ... c- conservative amount.  I -- I think they probably s- start at maybe ... t- thirty five thousand.
R:  Wow!
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Now, see the teachers up around here probably make about seventy or eighty.
L:  Yeah, well I think, you know, t- the, ah, teachers with -- that have been there a long time, yeah, that's probably what they're getting.  But, um, [SIGH] they don't start at that k- kind of wage because [SIGH] a lot of teachers are leaving -- leaving the field because they aren't making enough money.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- well see I always wanted --
L:  And that's [SIGH] --
R:  -- to be -- I always thought it would be awesome to be a teacher because you could [LAUGH] -- you work a hundred --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well our -- our school year around here is a hundred and eighty days.  [MN]
L:  I think that's one of the big ... c- clues to having better schools because I know with my [SIGH] -- my boys if they didn't like a teacher [SIGH] they don't do well in school.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, that's a -- that's a r- really big thing.  You've got to get good teachers in there.  [SIGH]
R:  Gee I mean everybody round here that I think is a -- I mean they're pretty -- I -- I know -- even though they're putting in all computer labs and -- and things like that so [SIGH] -- I mean the kids that are in school are going to know t- ten times as much by ... ... fourth grade as they are [SIGH] ... ah, as -- as I do, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, are you computer savvy?  [SIGH]
R:  N- not really.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I love the computer.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, we -- we have them at work.  We don't even have a computer here at the house.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my God, I couldn't survive.  [SIGH]  I'm on it, like, ... there's somebody on our computers every se- second of the day and n- night.  [SIGH]
R:  So, yeah, because it's getting to the point where you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's what I told my wife.  It's getting to the point where you have to have one.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  See, at the -- at our house everybody has their own.  [SIGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  We have, ah, f- four computers here, or more than that but e- everybody has t- their own.  [SIGH]  And then we have a +laptop -- laptops.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that's something that my -- my mom has.  They both have their own computer at the house.  I'd be happy with, ah, -- to get one here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I would --
L:  Like I couldn't --
R:  I -- I tell my wife --
R:  -- make it without it.
R:  -- [LAUGH] I tell my wife as soon as I figure out how it works you can be sure I'm going to get the computer.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, once you -- you have children in school you'll have a computer.  I'm sure.
R:  I'm sure, [SIGH] yeah, that's what we already said, as soon as we -- as soon as we do [SIGH] -- how far -- how far does your kids -- or were the -- were the schools close or do they have to go far -- bus far into school?
L:  Um, there is bussing.  But, um, the high school is ... probably ... about two miles away.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, really?  Well, that's not far.
L:  So, I'm not ... real far away.  Most of the schools are -- are close to ... where I l- live.  [SIGH]  Um, central middle school and the kindergarten centre is, like, [SIGH] you can walk there.  [SIGH]  And, um, [SIGH] the fifth and sixth grade school is [SIGH] -- maybe quarter of a mile away.  [SIGH]  A- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so the schools are ... c- close to here so I can't even complain about that.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  And we have a lot of 'em for -- [SIGH] for a suburb we have ... many schools.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, there's not big class sizes?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, there is at t- the high school because that's -- [SIGH] it's, um, freshmen through senior --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's all one building and it's just g- gigantic [SIGH] which I w- would like to see cut down into fr- freshmen and sophomores and juniors and teen seniors.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Because t- that's too big.  [SIGH]  But that's pretty much ... the only one.  [MN]
R:  Do they have a lot of, ah, -- extra c- -- like, football -- like what's big over -- like football, soccer, [SIGH] hoc-  [SIGH] or hockey --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- is it in Minnesota, hockey?
L:  Yeah, we have ... all of that ... and, um, ... I think we -- we haven't been beaten -- football.  That's ...  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, we -- we're -- football's -- football's real big up here too.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  It -- it's real big.  [SIGH]  They've, ah, -- h- have a lot of competition -- that's still a big sport but now ho- hockey's catching on real qu- -- hockey and soccer are catching up too.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  But I think sometimes they put too much emphasis on sports, [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and -- ah, away from the academics.  That might be part of the problem too but --
R:  I -- I just think it gives kids something -- kids something to do so they can ... s- stay -- I mean 'cause [SIGH] I think the -- when they're not doing something [LAUGH] that's when the -- the trouble can kick in.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  But I don't know what the solution is as far as making them better.  I think [SIGH] [PAUSE] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] maybe it's -- ah, maybe it all stems back to the teachers that they have to be able to motivate the -- the kids.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I know when --
L:  'Cause if --
R:  -- I was in school if I had a teacher that ... made it ... interesting you wanted to learn -- or made it more [SIGH] -- put it into practical solutions.  I -- that made me a l- -- learn a lot better than --
