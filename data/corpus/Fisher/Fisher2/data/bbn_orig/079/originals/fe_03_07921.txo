L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  
L:  Hi [MN].
R:  My name's Mary.
L:  What's your name?
R:  Mary.
L:  My name is Sharon.
R:  Hi, Sharon.
L:  Hi, how are you tonight?  Where are you l- --
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Your -- you sound like you're tired?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, I -- it's like eleven oclock my time and it's like, I was just about ready to go to bed.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] O- oh, that happens to me.  It's ten oclock here.  Where are you at?
R:  Idaho.
L:  Oh, Idaho.  Okay, we're in --
R:  Are you around Missouri --
L:  I'm in Oregon.
R:  -- or something?
L:  No, I'm in Oregon.
R:  Oregon?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, it's ten --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- oclock
L:  Yeah, it's ten oclock.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  It's ten oclock so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anyway, okay, if a benefactor give me a million dollars, would I never speak to my best friend again?  It would be really hard.  Er, I guess it would depend on the state of mind I was in at the moment but probably --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I wouldn't take it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not to ever speak to my best friend again.  [SIGH] That's --
R:  I, well --
L:  -- pretty important.
R:  -- maybe I might have thought of that at one time.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I've gone through so many friends and everything else I think, at this point, I would only because I would use it to try to help other people and try to help myself get out of debt and, y- you know, you can always --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- work around that.  Don't speak, uh, to your best friend.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's probably true -- probably true.  I guess my --
R:  You know, y- -- you know, 'cause sometimes you have to be practical and if they --
L:  True.
R:  -- understood what you were doing, y- you know?
L:  Yeah, true.  That is true.  I guess my theory --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is, is that at -- at this point of time, I've just -- I don't know.  I've gone through a lot of things in my life and I don't know whether a million dollars would change 'em or not.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know whether they be- -- that would be --
R:  Well, it'd change mine --
L:  -- not.
R:  -- I'd s- [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Well, it'd change it but I'm not sure it would change it that dramatically --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- but --
R:  No.
L:  -- definitely I'm not a wealthy person by any means, shape or form but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I definitely -- I don't know.  I don't know.  That'll be a -- like I say, it would depend on my state of mind at that time whether I -- you know, whether I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- would or not.  But, y- [MN] --
R:  I don't know.  I think -- I think that it would be a good idea because you never know what would happen if your best friend decided to turn on you --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and -- and then y- you've missed the chance of having that extra money to get yourself out of debt, invest something and help other people.
L:  Yep, that's true, very true.
R:  You know.
L:  Well, my husband was in the marine corps for twenty years and so my friends were like few and far between, really best --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- friends so I guess that's why my best friend probably is really important to me because I've -- she's been around for a long, long time and I don't know whether it would be really --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- tough[?] 
R:  You know.
L:  Hard to let her go --
R:  I know.
L:  -- but I -- it would definitely be something to think about.  I mean, it would --
R:  Y- it's just the terms.  I mean, you could get --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- around that kind of a thing.
L:  That's true.
R:  I th- I think you could.  I think you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- could take it at face value and -- and you could, um, write your friend, or t- or do it, kind of like on a secret thing or to be able to b- --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- [inaudible] knowing what was going on.  [LAUGH]
L:  True.  Very true, very true, very true.
R:  I don't know.  I have to think around things like that because I've gotta be practical.
L:  Yep.
R:  I m- [MN] you know?
L:  So, we all have to be practical.  I mean, that's -- that's the way life should run but we're not always --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- practical --
R:  No.
L:  -- you don't always do the -- the best thing for us some times.  And I think the older we get, the l- less we do the things best for us.  
R:  Well, the older we get --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the -- actually the older we get, the harder it is to make new best friends.
L:  That's true.  That's very true.  And that's probably another reason why I would feel that way but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's hard to, you know, it -- it's hard to find a really good friend anymore.  Really good friends are few and far between anymore --
R:  Well --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- you know what the problem was with me is I met, w- you know, when you're in you're forties and you're in the inbetween and you -- and you think like you're a young person and you wanna be around young people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but -- but where you live, they require you to be around l- people your own age [NOISE] but there aren't enough people your own age.  Then all that's left is old people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's the state I ended up in in Missouri.
L:  Oh --
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now I'm in Idaho. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Is that --
R:  But --
L:  -- where you're from originally?  Is Missouri?
R:  No --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- California.
L:  Oh, California.
R:  And but -- but, um, I lived there up until I was twenty eight and then I moved to Missouri and spent the next thirteen years there.
L:  Ah.
R:  And -- and now I've been in Idaho for n- -- for about eight months.
L:  Ah.
R:  And I really like it here.
L:  Where are you at in Idaho?
R:  Pocatello.
L:  Oh, Pocatello.  Up -- up -- up a little --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ways.
R:  No, actually, it's -- well, it's, um, [LIPSMACK] southeast.  You know Idaho?
L:  Southeast.  [inaudible]
R:  It -- it's right -- it- it's --
L:  Mm, like in the tip.
R:  Well, it's on the border of Utah.
L:  Oh, mm, mm.
R:  On the top end of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Utah.
L:  My daughter lived in Boise for a while and she really didn't like it there.  I liked it.  I -- when I went to visit her, I liked it there too but -- but that's true.  You -- sometimes you find yourself in situations where it's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- either all old people or all young people and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- b- being in the forties is not -- I'm not in the forties.  I'm in my sixties but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being -- being -- I can remember when I was forty.  Yeah, and you don't -- you don't really -- well, not associate with the young people necessarily because they have strange ideas but yet you don't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- wanna associate with the young peo- old people because you don't wanna be old.
R:  You're not old yet.  And -- and then --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- Missouri where I ended up, I was ending up or just around old people.  And it was really wearing me down.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I can --
R:  Um, and then I aged in my face awfully early and so people would think I was a senior citizen.  
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Wh- -- yeah, I --
L:  That's not good.
R:  -- mean, I would get the senior -- I would get the discount on coffee and whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's not good.  That's not good at --
R:  No.
L:  That kinda gets to you.
R:  I mean, I'm glad for the discount.
L:  [MN]
R:  But I wasn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- very happy that I was considered old.
L:  That people thought --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you were old, huh.  Well, see --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if you got a million dollars then you wouldn't -- then you could get a face lift or --
R:  Right, well y- --
L:  -- or a --
R:  -- you know, it's funny --
L:  -- a face sparkle[?] or something and ... [LAUGH]
R:  What's really funny though about looking old and I thought it would be a bad thing.  But here in Idaho, people that haven't known me before, that don't know that I'm younger and they just think I'm old, they actually treat me with more respect.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's very weird.  [LAUGH]
L:  I can imagine.  I can imagine, yep --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yep.  Well, like I say, if you won that -- if you got that million dollars, well then you could --
R:  Mhm, well --
L:  -- get your face lifted and --
R:  -- I get my face back --
L:  I have a wrinkle --
R:  -- and I cry.
L:  -- all the wrinkles taken out and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And your skin peeled and --
R:  [COUGH] Really, hm.
L:  All that stuff that it takes to make you young and beautiful again.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah.  Well, it wouldn't -- it wouldn't be that -- it would be bad if I could find a guy out here my own age that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that I could be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have as a boyfriend and eventually marry or something.  I've been through two marriages and --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R: -- and my first husband, um -- well, we were together for eight years and the marri- -- the marriage fell apart but we always cared about each other but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- th- the problem is -- is w- that we lost touch for extenuating circumstantial reasons --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and the next thing I know, I hear that he has gotten in a car wreck and -- and passed away. 
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And he did that before I had a chance to tell him I forgave him and I cared about him again so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Not good.
R:  -- you know, no, that isn't good at all but --
L:  Uh-uh, mm mm.
R:  -- but, um, you know, but we were -- he was nine years younger than me.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I -- but now that I'm like forty two, it's like -- I'd like to be with a guy that's younger than me but -- but since I look so old, it's [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's kinda hard.  [LAUGH]
L:  I have a girl -- my girl -- my best girlfriend, speaking of girlfriends -- my best girlfriend is -- she's married to -- this is her third marriage too, and she's married to a guy who's like -- I think, he's like ten years younger than her but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she's a blond, a very light blonde and I think that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- blondes just never look old.  I don't think Sandy will ever look old and she's the --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- same age I am.
R:  Well, I --
L:  But I just don't think --
R:  -- I've got this --
L:  -- she'll --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ever age.
R:  I've got this really young voice.  I've got this voice that I think is never gonna grow old.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  So, that -- that's what stayed young.  A- and I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's because I -- I still have a young spirit at least --
L:  [MN] Right.
R:  -- and I've never done anything like smoke to ruin my voice but --
L:  Right, right.
R:  [MN] But, um --
L:  Yeah, I -- I, um, you know -- I, you know -- I've never been a smoker or a drinker either and it's just -- just that I just don't like it.  It has nothing to do with my opinion of it.  It's just that I just have never liked it.  My daughter was just saying the other day, she --
R:  Right.
L:  -- see how anybody could have never smoked and never drank and have as many health problems as I do.  And I said, "Well, you know --"
R:  Oh, no.
L:  "-- some people just fall apart and some people don't, you know".  But I --
R:  What -- what I have found -- excuse me -- what I have found is grow- age -- growing old is a gradual process.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I [MN] -- I -- when I was thirty s- seven, thirty eight I -- I got arthritis in my leg for the first time.  It scared me to death and, um, but, uh, oh, no, you know, this is the beginning of growing old be- [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's a gradual decline.  It doesn't happen all at once.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  But -- but what bothers me is that when people grow old physically somehow their mentality grows old too.  
L:  Mhm --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- mhm.
R:  And I don't understand that being young and I don't ever want that to happen to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you just have to stay real alert and stay on top of things, you know.  Make sure --
R:  Well, yeah, but --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- it also has to do with attitude and I think a lot of it --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- has to do -- has to do with bitterness and if they end up carrying up a lot of bitterness, then they just grow old.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Oh, definitely.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  So ...
L:  -- the bitterness --
