L:  Hi, I'm Carrie.
R:  I'm Patricia.
L:  Oh, hi.  Ah, what was the topic?  [LAUGH] I missed --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  What was the topic of the day?  I missed it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Affirmative action in hiring.
L:  Okay, permanent action and hiring.  Um, actually, I'm a stay home mom, so [LAUGH] --
R:  So am I, so, I'm not really sure about that.
L:  -- okay, so [LAUGH] we're gonna be blind on that part aren't we.  [LAUGH] 
R:  What is affirmative action and hiring?
L:  Yeah, um, [LIPSMACK] permanent action, is that what you said?
R:  Affirmative.
L:  Affirmative, okay.  Um, [SIGH] I don't know, I guess you can go and give your opinion first, if you want, or are you caught off guard too?
R:  I think I'm caught off guard because I'm not even [MN] -- I don't know what they mean by that.
L:  Me either.  Yeah.
R:  The door -- hm, well this is a good one.  [LAUGH]
L:  No kidding, this is, like, the hardest one I've had.
R:  It's, ah, me too.
L:  Affirmative action in hiring.
R:  [NOISE] Hm.
L:  Um, do you think it means, like, quickly hiring, not putting thought to it maybe?
R:  That could be, and maybe checking the background.
L:  Yeah.  Maybe that's what they're meaning.
R:  Well, that would be a really good thing.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Which I would think they would need to do background check ups in certain fields.
R:  Well, here in California I don't think they do that too much.
L:  Oh, do you live in Calif- -- I live in Illinois [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so, yeah, but, um, as far as I know [SIGH] I'm thinking they do most the time, which I think they really need to, especially in school systems.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That and day cares.
L:  Yeah.  Do they do that where you live in?
R:  No, they really don't.
L:  Oh my, that's scary.
R:  Yeah, ah, that's one of the reasons I stay at home.
L:  Ah, yeah, [LAUGH] exact- --
R:  You see all these things where these things are happening to these kids at the day care, it's like, "I don't think so".
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Which my -- my -- my mother in law is, um, a day care provider at her house, [SIGH] which me and my husband made that decision [SIGH] for me to stay home with my children [LAUGH] and so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we c- -- I mean, we make ends meet and you make it, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's about the same way here.
L:  I mean, I would rather stay home with my children.  I mean, my eldest one, he's six --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he did go to pre school, like, part time, which I knew the teachers, it is the same school system I went through [LAUGH] so that was good, and so --
R:  Yeah, I've got four of 'em.
L:  Oh, my.  Do you, um, send them to public school or do you home school?
R:  A public.
L:  Public, yeah.
R:  I discovered I don't have the patience.  [COUGH]
L:  Oh, me neither, I know -- I know I wouldn't.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well my oldest is -- is turning fifteen soon and my baby is two.
L:  Oh my, so you --
R:  So.
L:  -- have you been a stay home mom?
R:  Just for the last one.  The other ones, I stayed home with them for the -- like the first two years and then I went back to work, but this one I'm staying longer.
L:  Yeah.  So, have you always lived in California then?
R:  No, actually we've traveled around --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, my family was in air force.
L:  Okay, yeah.  So, that you had to really move around --
R:  Yes we did.
L:  -- and so -- but, I would think [SIGH] that that's what that would mean, affirmative.  I don't know, I don't have no dictionary in front of me.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, I do -- I pull up everything on line and I'm not near the computer right now.  Hey James, what's affirmative action?  [NOISE] No, what is it, serious?  [NOISE] What is it?  [NOISE] To do.  [NOISE] Just make it simple.  [NOISE] Okay.  Oh.  [NOISE] It's like equal rights.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] Okay, so it's like -- okay -- okay, that makes sense.  [NOISE] So, affirmative action just means that there's gotta be so many of each race.  [NOISE] Okay, now he's confusing me even worse.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, if it's that then I wouldn't think that would be right, you know what I'm saying?
R:  I think it's whoever's best for the job.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Whoever's got the most qualifications --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wouldn't that be -- couldn't you just, like, discriminate against them?
R:  Tha-, ah, that seems like it would be to me.
L:  'Cause I mean, [SIGH] I don't know, that's what I would think.  I mean if a person that was black or colored or whatever, didn't --
R:  Would --
L:  -- have --
R:  The same qualifi- --
L:  -- the qualifications as the other person or vice versa.
R:  How can you hire them?
L:  Yeah, exactly, just based on their color.
R:  That's -- that's kind of messed up.
L:  Exactly.  That's what I would think, so, but, I mean, around here, I've never really heard of that.  [LAUGH]
R:  I haven't either, not -- not really, not around here.
L:  But maybe they do in some companies.  Maybe the bigger firms or something.
R:  Well I don't know, 'cause they don't hire me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Me either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hey, you know what, now this is --
L:  [LAUGH] I never.
R:  -- they need to hire more women.
L:  Yeah.  So, let's the -- hike, okay.  So, we can discriminate on women or, you know, the race and gender and that would get, you know, complicated.
R:  But what about on education?
L:  Yeah, like who doesn't, you know.
R:  Hey, this kind of reminds me of school.
L:  Exactly [LAUGH] my lands, but --
R:  Teacher's pet, oh.
L:  Oh goodness.  Yeah.
R:  Well, that doesn't seem right at all.
L:  No.  That wouldn't seem right, it -- that's not right, yeah.  'Cause, I mean, that's exactly -- 'cause I know my husband just got supervisor at his job and I know he said stuff before like, he always has to watch because they're in a union or whatever, 'cause the union protects and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I'm like, "Okay".
R:  So, they're saying that if [SIGH] --
L:  That don't make no sense --
R:  -- if there's a wrong amount of people in where he works he would not have made supervisor, somebody else less qualified would to make that quota.
L:  [SIGH] I don't think so, 'cause he's like, um, [SIGH] he's only been there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eight or nine years and there's been people there longer than him.  He had more qualifications, do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was more provided on the job.  When a job came up and he was always signing up for it.  Do you know what I mean?  When other guys wouldn't sign up for it, so they said he had more [NOISE] understanding of the jobs even if there was other people there less years or more years, vice versa.
R:  Yeah.  It seems to me it should be based solely on who is qualified for it.
L:  Exactly.  Like how -- that's what they considered with him, you know what I'm saying, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he had -- he knew all the equipment and stuff like that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but that'd be kind of aggravating if somebody came in and didn't know it and he had --
R:  It was, ah.
L:  -- been there more years.
R:  And was hired just because they were of a different race.
L:  Yeah, or gender, we could say.
R:  Or gender even, yeah.  That's just --
L:  And so, that's crazy.
R:  Oh, that would really make me mad.
L:  Uh-huh.  That's the way, yeah.  Which I think, when you're in the unions like he -- which like he was, he was in a union, but now, since he went to the supervisor, he's company or whatever.  The unions are more protected in that so maybe that would have to be -- do you know what I mean?
R:  I wonder if the unions do this affirmative thing too.
L:  That's what I'm wondering.  That's what -- so that's --
R:  Ooh, now I gotta go look this up.
L:  [LAUGH] We'll be curious now [LAUGH] and what states allow it?
R:  I can't imagine them allowing that here, I can't see that.
L:  Because --
R:  But then I'm not out there either.
L:  Me either, so that's what I mean.  So, you were a stay home mom for your kids just first couple of years?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, did you like going back to work or did they make you feel ...?
R:  Oh, I kind of liked it, but at the same time I didn't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I enjoy being home with the baby.  I work on the computer now, so I'm with her all the time and then I'm home for the kids when they get in.
L:  Yeah.  Let's see, well, I only have two kids, mine's six and four.  So, it's kind of like -- and I admit it -- me and my husband been married I guess eight years, yeah, it's -- I mean I've been stay home 'cause we planned on having kids right away, so I mean, I've never been in, really, the work force I guess you'd say, so I wouldn't really know.  When I --
R:  Well, the way it is now, from what I understand, we ain't missing too much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly, I mean --
R:  These days you have to be so over qualified.
L:  You know, the funny thing, I mean, the weird thing about ... every with the college degree and all that, I mean, I don't know.  My mom didn't have a college degree and she is more higher up in her job than people that are coming up out of college and she's making more than them.
R:  Oh, wow.  What does she do?
L:  Um, she works in a newspaper --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- -- she's over -- head over the advertising department, and so it's kind of like, whoa, with all these people coming out of college and even there's older people that have been in college, which she -- what it was is she sold more ads and she proved herself.
R:  That's what it is; it's all about applying yourself.
L:  Yeah, that's what I mean.  [MN] I'm proud of her, I mean.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I would be too.
L:  So, and she was a stay home mom up until, maybe I was in second or third grade.  So, I mean, she was -- [SIGH] she didn't --
R:  So, you're carrying on the tradition.
L:  [LAUGH] I guess so, but.
R:  Do you have boys and girls or?
L:  Two boys.
R:  Two boys, oh boy.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] that's what I think.  Now what do you have?
R:  I have one boy and three girls.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  And I have to say the girls are easier.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] That's a -- oh, man, my mother in law had six boys and I'm like, "Okay, I'm --"
R:  Six?
L:  -- stopping".  Yes, she wanted a girl, and I go, I tell my husband, I go, "You're the only one that's had two boys in a row, so we're stopping now".  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  I know I'm going to be the one that has all the boys. --
