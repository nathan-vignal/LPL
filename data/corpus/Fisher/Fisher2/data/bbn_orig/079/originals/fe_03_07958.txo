L:  I don't know what size to get.  [SIGH]
R:  Hello?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Hello?  [SIGH]
R:  Hi!  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, there.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] my name's Monica.  [LAUGH]
L:  My name is Quentin.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi!  [SIGH]  Um ...
L:  How are you doing?  Wh- wh- what is the topic again?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [SIGH] it was ... public schools.  And it was, like, do you believe there's something -- if -- is there something seriously wrong with America's public schools?
L:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, what do you think?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, what do I think?  Oh, well I think -- I think the public schools are [SIGH] -- are actually nice ... considering, you know, say --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being as far as the United States is concerned, [SIGH] compared to other schools in other countries.  I believe that we do have it good.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  What about you?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [SIGH] well I went to a really nice public school, um, in -- ah, John's Town Pennsylvania.  [SIGH]
L:  Pennsylvania.
R:  And ... ah, growing up I never thought t- there was a problem with the p- public schools just because my own experience was very limited [SIGH] in being in, like, a well funded area, [SIGH] and, you know, we always had n- new books and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] always had a lot of, like, art supplies and our music program was fine and all of that.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And then, um, [LIPSMACK] I actually went down to, ah, Mississippi to Clarksdale, Mississippi, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- where they have -- it was, like, a -- the second poorest county in the country or something like that.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And there -- I -- I spent some time in the elementary school with the first grade class just, -- you know, I would spend an hour a day j- just helping the teacher with the kids.  [SIGH]  And they had, you know, it was obviously a public school, and they had, you know, not enough bo- books for the whole class.  They had no workbooks.  [SIGH]  If the teachers wanted --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- work sheets for their c- classes, they had to photocopy it out of their own salaries [SIGH] and their salaries were so low that, like, you know, it was very hard for them to even get people to work there.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, that's bad.
R:  So, I think that what I've noticed and what I think is probably the biggest problem with America's public school system is the [SIGH] huge difference in ... um --
L:  [MN]  Funding?  [NOISE]
R:  -- standards, you know.
L:  Oh, the standards.
R:  Well, not -- I mean not standards of learning but standards of, [SIGH] like, [SIGH] you know, ... like, my school being so great and having so many resources [SIGH] and then that school having so few, it just seems, like, such a large discrepancy, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  I can understand that.  I mean [SIGH] the school that I went to, ah, very well [NOISE] here in, ah, High Ville, [NOISE] Georgia [SIGH] --
R:  It was in Georgia?
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  What -- what fault are you on.  I mean where are you at?  [SIGH]
R:  Um, I'm in Pennsylvania right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now.
L:  Pennsylvania right now?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, [SIGH] but, ah, here in Georgia I mean [NOISE] the schooling is -- is pretty good and what not.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] I grew up -- we had s- -- [NOISE] basically the same as you, all funding and everything was [NOISE] good.  [SIGH]  We kept good up to date books and everything [NOISE] so that's why I p- probably say that [SIGH] the public schools are [NOISE] ... pretty good for down here.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I know there are areas that -- [SIGH] that lack that kind of support and funding --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for like the books and material and things.  And that is bad.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, it's sad, I mean I think [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it doesn't g- give people an --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- equal starting point, you know?
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  Like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I -- I tend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to believe that there's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- very little natural talent in a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in a child.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean there is but at the same time s- so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much [SIGH] has to do with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- their, [SIGH] you know, encouragement --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and what they're exposed to.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it just seems to me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, [SIGH] you know, if a person's exposed to ... all kinds of updated materials and like, [SIGH] you know, really good [SIGH] workbooks and [SIGH] good educational supplies, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] going to make a big difference to somebody who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doesn't even get a book.
L:  [SIGH]  True.  True, 'cause you see, like, [SIGH] ah, education is -- is changing and -- and [NOISE] -- and things -- the w- world is e- evolving so much --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] that i- it i- is important to keep up with, [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, what's going on a- as far as educational wise.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And if you look over like in, [SIGH] ah, China where they go to school year round.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, you know, ah -- ah it could make a [SIGH] big difference.  It could make a [SIGH] big difference in -- in a person's f- future --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- and ... how they achieve, you know, [SIGH] how they look at life and how they l- look at their career, you know, [NOISE] ho- -- where they want to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well I think [SIGH] -- I don't know, I -- I never really was exposed to a lot of people in private school.  We had, um, [SIGH] -- we had a -- like a Catholic school here.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  There was a Catholic school but [SIGH] that's a little bit different than, y- you know, like a prep school or a, you know, really expensive private school.
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, that was unfortunate that -- the division through all those [SIGH] who either had that kind of experience of private schools and stuff like that now.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that [SIGH] -- I don't know.  Is private schools would you say is better than a public school?  [SIGH]
R:  See I don't really think it's better because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean I -- I don't really like the idea --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of it.  [LAUGH]  I really like the idea of public schools and it being ... available to everybody.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And I think everybody should be given, like, an equal starting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- point [SIGH] and equal access to education.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  [MN]  Private schools seem --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like ... [MN] like if there's something so wrong with your public school that you don't think your kid should go there, then why not just invest [SIGH] your money, or -- or your -- your time and effort into making that public school better?
L:  [SIGH]  And that's --
R:  You know, like, --
L:  -- very good.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- why is your kid better than like the kids who can't afford ... to go to that private school?
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  [SIGH]  I guess [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  -- I mean it's not very capitalistic of me to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, sounding but --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean that's the way I think about education.  I think it's like [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, there's no reason --
L:  Everybody should have access to the same education.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I agree, you know, I say nobody should be cut short if -- if [SIGH] -- if it's supposed to be a equal opportunity type thing [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well you should have -- everybody should ... receive the same kind of education but [SIGH] that goes to show what kind of ... s- society we live in --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- as well, you know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Nothing is f- fair.  It's made -- it's supposed to make you to believe that it's not.  It is but it's not.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I [NOISE] --
R:  Well, I think when you have, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a public school system [SIGH] and, [MN] the idea that -- that everything's fair but then you also have like [SIGH] all of our politicians and, --
L:   [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, our President and y- you know, everybody sending their kids to pri- -- to private school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] because they can afford it.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  So, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would -- wouldn't it be more important for them to, like, recognize that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their kids -- that every kid in this country is, [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] as good as their kid and can be as smart as them if they ... have the same opportunities?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Well, you know, ah -- ah, on a -- on another note, [NOISE] [SIGH] ah, there are maybe certain reasons that, ah, private schools [SIGH] maybe used, ah, say like different reasons per se [SIGH] -- like if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- their parents are -- are [SIGH] dig- dignitaries or someone like that send children off there --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] then I would understand the private schools 'cause, you know, if -- the world is crazy [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know.  So, I would understand that in that sense, [SIGH] [NOISE] as far as the private schools are concerned.
R:  Yeah, if it came to, like, security.
L:  Yeah, right, security.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I'm saying.  But other than that I -- public schools are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause they really limit your -- your -- your communications [SIGH] and -- and the people that you -- can l- learn about and relate to.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, definitely.  [SIGH]
L:  And -- and that's important.  [LIPSMACK]  That's important.  I think that's important for everybody [SIGH] to be able to converse [NOISE] with different ... c- cultures and different [SIGH] beliefs and different religions.  [SIGH]  And they shouldn't be --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- kind of --
R:  -- definitely.
L:  -- segregated.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I think that -- I think that that does tend to happen ... with private schools --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] is [SIGH] that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- end up being segregated along, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, racial and religious lines.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  And, I don't know.  I mean I don't know if that gives --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a person the best --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think it does [LAUGH] at all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- give them the best education --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because [SIGH] you don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know difference can make --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- broaden all of your ideas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like things you never would have thought of.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And if you surround yourself with just everybody, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, who's really similar to you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and is going to tell you the same thing over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and over again [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then [SIGH] how are you going to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ever come up with new ideas?
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  I just -- it g- gives you -- it kind of hinders you.  It's a block.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  I think so.
L:  [MN]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  That's good.  [NOISE]
R:  So, -- and -- and there -- I just don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] I don't really know h- how the public schools --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] the problems can be corrected --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean there's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different ideas about [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, school vouchers and things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like that.
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  But it just seems like [SIGH] -- like the voucher -- I mean I don't really understand the voucher system that well, but it -- I guess it means you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can take what your tax money would be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] paying for your public school and use that for any school, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- within a certain area.  [SIGH]  I guess it allows people to go to, like, religious schools if they want to or something like that.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But it seems like the problem with that is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like if -- if a half of the kids from your school up and leave because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're parents can [SIGH] afford to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cho- -- you know, send them somewhere else --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --like as far as giving them transportation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] then w- what kind of resources is your school left with?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, and I'm thinking about, like, the Mississippi case in particular if [SIGH] -- like half of those kids their parents could afford to maybe send them [SIGH] -- pay for transportation for them to go somewhere else and use the voucher to go somewhere else, what about the rest who are there and still have nothing?  [SIGH]
L:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah.  That's something else -- that's something there.  That's something to look at.  That's a very important issue right there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Very important.  [NOISE]  I don't know --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- I really w- would have a [SIGH] ... solution for public schools either.
