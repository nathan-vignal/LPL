L:  Dorveig[?] here.  Dorveig.
R:  Hi, this is Rachel.
L:  Hi, Rachel.  Dor- -- my name is Dorveig.
R:  Hi, Dorveig.
L:  Hi, Rachel. [PAUSE]
R:  So, you wanna talk about the topic?
L:  Well, did you hear the -- the -- the topic?  Did you hear it?
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  What is your reaction?
R:  Um, I think it depends on how good the relationship was with my best friend.  I mean, a million dollars is a lot of money, you know.
L:  Yes.  Well, I have friends come and go.  Well, people that call themselves my friends and remaining in contact with people is, uh, very impossible.
R:  Yeah, sometimes that's true.  But I think if people are really your friends, no matter how much time goes by or what happens, they're still gonna have communication with you and be in your life.
L:  Well, [LIPSMACK] I am living in California for thirteen years and I find keeping in contact with people very difficult.  They say they will show up some time, they never do.  They say they will return calls, they never do. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  So, basically do you think it's impossible to have somebody that's a best friend?
L:  That's the way it looks.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  See I have lived in seven other countries; Israel, Hungary, Italy, France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Puerto Rico and I see the same thing that I do here.  It's, um, it's rather impossible to keep people -- get people to commit to staying in contact with you.  It's rather impossible.  Why that is --
R:  Well, let's get back to the topic.  Okay, so say a benefactor offered you a million dollars but you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could never speak to your best friend again.  Now, I hear you saying that you don't think it's possible to even have a best friend so does that mean that you would go with the million dollars no matter what?
L:  Well, considering that I would take the money because the money -- the money will do things for you that so called friends will not.
R:  Okay, so say you spend all the money.  You blow it all in, I don't know, six months.  Let's -- let's say you did have a best friend 'cause that's what the topic was about.  
L:  True.
R:  Say -- say you did have a best friend and you blow all the money and then you have nothing and you --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- don't even have this best friend.  What about that?
L:  Well, I am kind of careful with money.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, that's good. [LAUGH] That's a good thing.
L:  Yes.  I'm careful with money.
R:  I'm not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That -- that -- that is funny. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I learned that once you spend money you cannot replace it.  I was holding onto a million dollars like you wouldn't believe. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I know, but see I'm the kind of person that if like I had a million dollars I don't wanna like use it to go travel and -- not that I'd necessarily buy a bunch of unnecessary things but I wouldn't want -- I would probably use a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of it.  I would try to save some of it.
L:  Yes.
R:  But I know that I would use more than I would save, just knowing my personality.
L:  Me, I would take half of it and put it in the bank.
R:  See that's good if you're disciplined that's good.
L:  At least.  At least ha- -- at least half of it.
R:  What would you do with the other half?
L:  Well, I would travel to some places I wanna see and [LIPSMACK] buy a few things for my, um, teeth they're falling apart. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] And, um, buy a, um, [LIPSMACK] buy a condo for myself to live in the rest of my life.
R:  Yeah, that sounds nice.  That's good. I mean, I would probably pay off all my debts.  You know, put some away for my future, for my kids and then I'd probably spend the rest travelling.  You know, make sure I had a few nice things that I really wanted.
L:  Well, see that's a good investment.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't just all go blow it all on like some fancy car or anything like that.
L:  [SIGH] I tried owning a car one time and, uh, I've learned what someone told me.  If you buy a used car you're buying someone else's trouble.  If you buy new every year the guarantee fixes it all the time.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I tried owning a car one -- no.  No thank you.  No thank you on a car.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I'd just by a condo live in the rest of my life.  So, that when I get old I have a place to sleep. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, let's say you had all that money and you had a best friend before you had the money.  A -- a really -- let's say it's a really good friend.  Somebody you could tell everything to.  Somebody who is there for you.  Somebody who does show up when they say they're going to and all that and you sacrifice that for the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- money.  Would it be worth it?
L:  Well, to answer your question I've had people for many, many years who claimed they would show up and they never do show up.
R:  Well, let's just --
L:  I wish[?] --
R:  Let's just say this person does.  Like they're --
L:  True.
R:  -- really -- they're really devoted to being your friend.
L:  I follow you.
R:  So --
L:  Well, I -- I guess I would feel bad.  I would feel bad.
R:  I mean, I think that like when all is said and done money is just money.  But I mean, if it's a real true friend that's gonna be there the rest of your life, to me honestly, that's more important.
L:  True.  You have a point.  You have a valid point.  Valid, um --
R:  If -- if that really -- if that person really is there and they're really someone you can talk to because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, relationships don't always last, jobs don't always last but a really good friend I could see that could -- that could last.
L:  Yeah, you have a valid point.  You have a very valid point.  True people are more important than money but let me ask you -- but let me ask you this.  What happens when you have -- have nowhere -- nowhere to live because you have no money?
R:  Well, that's a big problem.  Believe me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I know.  It sucks to be broke.  I mean --
L:  Do you follow me?
R:  Yeah.  And then I would hope you have family and friends to stay with. [LAUGH]
L:  I have no family or friends.  That's why I'm asking you; what happens when you have no money to pay your rent?
R:  It's really hard.  I don't know.  I mean --
L:  Y- you see what --
R:  I've been there and it's like a really stressful feeling because it's like nowhere to turn, nowhere to go.
L:  Exactly.  I have met people who have told me that friends come and go but are you familiar with the cosmetics lady Elizabeth Arden?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  I read a biography of her about -- let's see this is June zero three.  This was summer of zero two. [LIPSMACK] She was born poor and turned into a rich person and she discovered one strange thing. [LIPSMACK] It's got to do with people and friends.  She said, "Friends will stab you in the back but money never will.  Particularly friends and lovers will stab you in the back".
R:  Yeah, I guess that's true.
L:  Now -- now you can take that any way you want but she said, "Money will always be there for you".
R:  Yeah, I guess if --
L:  Now --
R:  If you have it -- it will.  I mean, I've never --
L:  No- --
R:  I've never known what it's like just to have enough money to just always --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- have money.  You know what I mean?  It's always a struggle for me.
L:  [MN] Yes.  Me -- me too.  But that's what I mean.  If you -- let's say you were to get a million dollars tomorrow and go and buy a condo to live in for the rest of your life.  All right?  How many times have you seen people come up to you and wanna be your best friend because they found out you had money?  Do you see this?  How many times you see this?
R:  Uh, I s- -- I see it around.  I mean, I live in Southern California, you know. 
L:  Me also.  I see a lot of times people try to be my friend because they heard I had money.  They believe I had money or some way indicated I had money.  People run away from me because they see I do not have any money.  Do you see what I'm showing you?
R:  Mhm.  I think --
L:  Do you see this?
R:  I think that's true.  People judge a person by how much money they think they have or don't have.
L:  Exactly my point.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, well, my Ukraine father's oldest brother found out that money -- now you may not like to hear this but, uh, this is the words of my oldest -- my father's oldest brother.  "Money will buy you love in any country".
R:  I -- I believe it's true, unfortunately.
L:  And strange as this may seem coming from me I would take the money over a so called friend because I've had fr- -- people they claim they are my friends, they claim they will call me, claim they will see me, claim they'll go here with me and then never see them again for like weeks at a time.  So, I would --
R:  Then they're not -- then they're not really your friends.  Part of it is figuring out who your -- I think that when you get into certain situations maybe when either you have a lot of money or you don't have any money, you kind of learn who your real friends are.
L:  Exactly my point.  But I would still take the money over someone -- anyone who calls themself my friend because I have -- like I s- -- I meet people.  "Oh, I'm your friend.  I'm your friend.  I'm
