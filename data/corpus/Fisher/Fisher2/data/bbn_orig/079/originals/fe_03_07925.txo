L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Fonda[?] Howie[?] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from Fairmont, West Virginia.  Who am I talking to?
L:  Hi, my name is Tricia Plant[?] and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm [NOISE] from Erie, [NOISE] Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Great, great.
L:  This is a pretty neat phone survey, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It is.  It's really fun.  I love research.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Uh, I'm a retired school teacher.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  So, this is a very timely topic.  
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, it is.  Especially [NOISE] wh- you know, it's been in the news and with new funding [NOISE] being allocated for better [NOISE] school systems, I think it is a pretty good [NOISE] topic.
R:  It is.
L:  How are the school systems in West Virginia?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, we're improving.  Um, we -- we, uh, have spent a lot of money over the last t- uh, decade, uh, building up the computer side of our education system and, uh, we were a leader in the state a few years ago in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- technology and, um -- and our test scores are rising and, um, I know there's some good and bad and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ugly things about education but, um, you can't just all, you know -- condemn it all.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I truly agree with you.  We live in a -- actually it's funny your test scores are going up and ours are going down in our area.  And, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I don't know, they keep revamping and rebuilding new schools and consolidating and localizing, I think, thinking they'll make it better but [SIGH] I don't know.  You can- and you know, then you hear teachers are not doing this and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you hear, well, students are different, you know?  I don't know.
R:  That's what I'm hearing from my, uh -- [MN] +my colleagues who are still -- the teachers who are still in the system.  They're saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, uh -- that students, um, er, first of all, they're -- i- it's discipline and I know from, uh, my experience that if I don't have control of my classroom --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my students aren't going to learn and so, um, that's a big problem right now is, uh, whatever's going on -- whatever's going on in society, you're going to find is reflected, you know, fifteen to twenty times --
L:  In the classroom.
R:  -- in the classroom.  
L:  I, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I agree you.  And my husband and I even talk about this sometimes and we think, maybe not the sole reason, but maybe one of the possible reasons for that, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a lot more working parents and two working parent families now and it seems like kids are not as supervised as they used to be.
R:  That's right and --
L:  And -- and even if they're n- -- and maybe it's not even the supervision but how about knowing that mom or dad --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- is home --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- on call.
R:  That's the biggie.
L:  I think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so too.
R:  Ah, well, I don't know if you -- how you were raised, er, but I was raised on sixty two.  But I know -- I knew, that if I, er, got in trouble in school, basically before I got home from school, mother would have known about it and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I would have been disciplined at home, ah, as well as in the classroom.  So, that really helped a lot.
L:  I think so too.  And you're right.  A double doozer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you got your school punishment, then home too.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  And I think -- I mean, I'm thirty one but [MN] I think my parents were raised the same way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- you know, they carried it on to me.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But even now sometimes w- even with my kids and I quit -- I did work and I quit my job so I would be home --
R:  Oh, I'm so --
L:  -- for that very reason.
R:  -- proud of you.
L:  Well, it's kinda --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Money's tight --
R:  It's tough.
L:  -- but well --
R:  It is.
L:  -- worth the sacrifice. 
R:  Well, that's it.  I think a lot of -- and I'm a -- a home ec teacher, er, to boot.  So, I really do encourage the mothers -- if you're going to be a mother, then realize that you need to sacrifice the first six to thirteen years of your career if you're going to work out -- in -- out of the home, uh, t- uh, to these children.  But if you'll get 'em launched up until, um, say nine to thirteen years of age, uh, they'll be okay.  I mean --
L:  I -- yep.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I agree.  And then after, you know -- and [MN] depending on the child too.  Maybe you have a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- independent child where you know you could --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- go back to work.
R:  [MN] Right.  W- --
L:  You know, but some kids [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I notice [NOISE] some kids don't handle that very well.  Their mother gone.
R:  Well, see that's it.  We -- we have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some children that are eighteen when they're -- when they're eight and we ha- you know, in matu- -- I mean they're really very mature.
L:  Sure.
R:  And very trustworthy and -- and, er, that's the reason why every mother and father needs to consider before they go back to work, uh, th- the, um, you know -- th- the maturity level, the trustworthy level of their child.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, but, uh, that's one thing that really helps a teacher a lot a- and would have the educational system and I understand from my, uh, colleagues, uh, who are still in, that, um, they're moving toward more of a -- a -- a parent, uh, teacher, child relationship where -- where did I hear just the other day?  Uh, where this county, this state, this [MN] region, they, er, instituted, uh, this teacher.  For example, we did it in home ec back in the seventies and -- and sixties and seventies and eighties and some eighties but seventies definitely.  And we would do home visits to every student that was going to be in our program and we did that sort of like in the summer in August.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, so that, by the time and -- and sometime during the year too.  But, um, we're finding now, er -- least that research showed [LIPSMACK] that the discipline in the school system, the grades went up, th- th- the, uh -- achievement levels went up, the test scores went up whenever that teacher was given the -- the resources and the time to go and visit in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their, uh -- their students', uh, homes.  Or in a situation, you know -- for example, it doesn't have to be maybe in a home.  You know, yourself, uh, you're out on the baseball field watching your child play.
L:  Sure.
R:  Well, er, you know, it makes a big impact on that student -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that child if their teacher --
L:  Oh, any kind --
R:  -- c- --
L:  -- of one on one.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know --
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  -- it definitely -- it boosts morale.
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  And you know, oh my gosh --
R:  It helps --
L:  -- what was the question --
R:  It --
L:  -- again?
R:  Well --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it helped -- well, well, th- th- the state of the system.
L:  Sure.
R:  But I think that we're getting to the basic state of what the system is about.  What the problem is about.  Is that there's not enough home and teacher, [LIPSMACK] uh, you know, uh --
L:  Support, sure.  And I --
R:  Oh.
L:  And I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sure as a teacher you hear the one of those m- most common things and I hear it all the time, even though I don't agree.  You know, oh, they -- they have +tenure.  Their --
R:  Tenure.
L:  -- tenure.  Their not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going anywhere.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't care about --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- teaching any more.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're just waiting for the retirement package.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I think as like a [LIPSMACK] -- a move in our school district to get that stigma out of the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- school, they offered --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- t- you know, teachers close to retirement --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- good retirement packages --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in an effort to revamp and get new blood.
R:  Right.
L:  But I- I don't think that's gonna ch- --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know?
R:  Uh, no, I mean -- I -- I was dedicated teacher all my life and -- and, uh, er -- and in our school, I could name you out of twenty nine teachers, maybe one teacher that was there, er, what we call a deadbeat.  Uh, but really, uh, you -- I think you're gonna find, that the -- the education of your children is really top, er, er -- a big top, er -- a priority with that teacher and we love our students.  We -- we want to do what's best for them.  But the sad thing is, um, a- another thing is overloading the classroom.  Now, you know, uh, let's say I have, uh, twenty five in my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- class and I have a forty five minute, fifty minute class period.  Now, you know, how many minutes am I really gonna spend on that one student.
L:  Right.
R:  A -- a minute.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, a minute or two.
L:  And what if you have that one child --
R:  Wh- --
L:  -- or two --
R:  -- uh, yeah.
L:  -- that need more.
R:  Right, right. 
L:  You know, and there's always one or two.  You know, there's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- always somebody --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- ahead.  There's somebody behind --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- too.
R:  You know what I did though and I won an award on it with cooperative education -- uh, well, cooperative learning.
L:  What's that?
R:  And, um, that's where, um, you have about five students in a little group.  It's like -- it's almost like a little family.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Within the classroom.  And you'd have one -- a -- one h- A. or high performing student.  You make sure they got partnered with a low performing student with some average performing students and, uh, when you mix that all together, then you really had not only the teacher teaching that group but let's say that that A. student who -- who really was getting bored because they already know this, uh, then they could then be like a teacher --
L:  Like a peer to peer --
R:  Uh, yeah --
L:  -- support group.
R:  -- uh, p- that's right. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was a little peer p- uh, support group family and I would have like -- uh, I had like five tables in my room so I'd have five groups and I won an exemplary teacher of the year because of that --
L:  Well, that's a great idea.
R:  -- er, situation.  Mhm.
L:  See, we live in a -- are -- are you in a rural community?
R:  Yes.
L:  So are we.
R:  Very.
L:  And I think sometimes there's -- I love the country and I will never --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- move.
R:  Me either.
L:  But -- but sometimes I think some families get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they slip in the cracks.
R:  Uh-huh.  They do.
L:  And, you know, I think those are the, you know, you get --
R:  And that's another one of the problems, [several inaudible words] is there in our system is that we are g- letting too many slip through the -- the cracks. 
L:  And it's too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- easy too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know the proverbial child that got shoved through the system that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- gets through high school and can't read.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know it's not very often that you hear that.  But there's still a large percentage.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] Or you know, my little brother graduated from high school and he can read and write and he's not --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- you know, a -- a deficient person but he can't write a decent paragraph.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and -- and people like that.  And you know, I don't know, partly it's the student.  The -- the student that doesn't wanna --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- listen.
R:  Right.
L:  Or is combative.
R:  Well, er --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- well, and they -- th- -- they don't really want to write it and, uh, they're not [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, somehow encouraged to write to family and friends because now we get on, uh, uh, my email [LAUGH] -- [inaudible] used to my emails from my nephew.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, goodness.  I mean, he do- -- he d- doesn't capitalize his I's.  And I mean, it's -- a- th- they're talking in a whole new language.
L:  I'm, you know --
R:  So, mm.
L:  I'm so guilty of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that too in my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- own emails.  No punctuation and all lower --
R:  Right.
L:  -- letters.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's so easy to do though.
R:  Yes, and with an overcrowded -- in a classroom.
