R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is -- hi --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm John.
R:  Hi, John.  Good morning.  I'm Pam.
L:  Good morning.
R:  It's nice to meet you.
L:  You too.  Um, I'm kind of [MN] aga- uh, against affirmative action, specifically in the workplace.  Uh, I think it should be a, uh, as much as possible, a blind meritocracy and, uh, that should not take into account, uh, you know, race or any other sub category.
R:  Well, I agree with you, uh, to a point, that it is something that is antiquated --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, per- perhaps back in the sixties and seventies and maybe even into the early eighties, it was something that was probably a good thing, but, uh, today I think it's ou- outdated and I find it to be discriminating against, [SIGH] uh, all those of the Caucasian race, or not even all of the ones of the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Caucasian race, um, because o- uh, naturally Hispanics are included in the Caucasian race --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which I always find interesting that they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- not only do -- not only do they, um, discriminate against the Caucasian race, but they discriminate against certain ethnicities in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the Caucasian race.
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And I have found that it -- that to be very objectionable to me in the past, um, have you been listening to any, uh, of the ta- talk radio --
L:  [NOISE] Um --
R:  -- personalities talking about this topic of -- with the, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- recent court decision in colleges?
L:  Uh --
R:  About colleges?
L:  -- no- not [MN] in too much detail, you know, I've been out of school for a while, but I -- I think it's a different, um, s- a slightly different goal [MN] in creating a university class versus a bu- versus a business promotion.  Um, I think that the policies are -- [NOISE] can't be applied to every situation.  I think there was one case where, um, uh, I mean I went to Columbia, for example, and y- you know, we -- they were big into cre- creating a diverse class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, you know, not just looking at the -- the merits of the student, but trying to m- create the most interesting mix in a class where people would learn not just, um, [NOISE] academically, but also socially and that involves, um, in- almost an intentional mixing of, you know, races and ethnicities and whatnot.  And I think in that, um, with that goal, I think that that makes sense, but it -- I think it's very different from intentionally promoting somebody, you know, based on race within a -- within a corporate community.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I'm, you know, I'm a -- I'm a bit more, um, I'm -- I'm a bit less against, um, affirmative action in -- in a university setting.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think I, you know, I feel like that the -- our government has made a welfare class which now in i- now, um, ha- feels that they have entitlements coming to them which were not intended by our founding fathers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that because of that, o- many of the, um, [LIPSMACK] minorities are, um, are not fulfilling themselves as they could or they would had this not all taken place over the last, uh, two decades --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me, if I were trying to get into college and or my child was trying to get into college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were discriminated against or they were left behind --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because someone else was promoted or -- or accepted above them because of their race, that -- I would still be just as -- as, uh, upset --
L:  Right, uh --
R:  -- about it.
L:  Right, I think there has to be a limit in terms of how -- like, in terms of -- [MN] you still need to -- to observe some sort of, um, reputa- you know, or f- i- in the case of the university, you have to preserve some sense of reputation, um, and I think they still need as high a standards as possible for every, you know, whatever the school is.  Um, you know, regardless of race.  Um, if they are comparing to and, you know, they're relatively similar academically, though, and -- and whatnot, um, I don't know it -- I mean, i- [MN] universities try to create a -- a world that's not a- that's not like the real world in -- in a lot of situations.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.
R:  Exactly --
L:  Um --
R:  -- and that's not right, to me, that to me -- that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is like setting these people up thinking that, again, that they have an entitlement --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that --
L:  Well, that --
R:  -- when --
L:  -- that -- that's a -- that's an interesting point.
R:  -- but the -- but when they go into the real world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's gonna be, you know, it's gonna be different and it's -- that's, you know, to me that's not right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just think that -- that it's, you know, if it had been, like I said, if it had been in the -- in the sixties, seventies, that might have been a -- a cha- uh, you know, something that would be appropriate --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but today, I don't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- feel it is and I -- and I just am totally against any, um, any, um, artificial manufacturing of --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a classroom setting, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just find that --
L:  No, that --
R:  -- to be --
L:  -- that -- that's -- that's an -- that's an interesting point, um --
R:  -- because -- because, uh, also and they -- and I fi- I find that, uh, [SIGH] just from the research and study that I've done, because I've also been out of school for a long time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, that the schools are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- uh, predominantly, overwhelmingly very liberal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in their attitudes and I find [LAUGH] most of the young people that I talk to that are in school are practically communists --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, a- and I think that, uh, I think all -- a lot of that philosophy and ideologies -- i- ideology stems from the same feeling tha- of affirmative action --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- you know, like, that -- that, uh, that we have to take care of the poor downtrodden, you know, well --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, nobody took care of me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I did it all on my own.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] And I -- and I think I'm stronger for that, and I think that's what makes this country great.
L:  Right, that I agree with, 'cause I think --
R:  And I'm --
L:  -- makes sense.
R:  -- totally -- I'm just totally against, um, those kind of artificial things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you ever -- have you ever, as a white male, have you ever felt discriminated against?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, not intentionally, no, um, bu- e- even -- even when I went through the college admission process, um, you know, it -- it -- so- in some cases the admission pool is so big, you don't really realize --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, who does get accepted, so it -- it -- I didn't, on a -- on a one on one basis, I've never encountered it.
R:  Yeah, I think most of us probably, when -- now, when did you go to college?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I graduated in ninety five.
R:  Oh, so you're much younger than I am.
L:  Right.  Right.  But, uh, you know, I think, um, I -- I think your -- your points are -- are really valid and -- and, you know, it makes me kinda rethink.  I -- I wa- I was kind of also an e- uh, I was an idealist when I was in -- in college.
R:  Well, we -- we all were.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Especially if we were off ca- off, you know, on a living on a campus and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I ha- I happened to go to school, uh, li- while I was still living at home, actually, I was married most of my time that I was going to school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but as -- and -- and I was going to a community college which became a four year college and so I graduated from that in -- in, um, in Georgia --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, so I di- I really didn't experience -- I grew up in the Army --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my dad was in the Army --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so we --
L:  Actually --
R:  -- were --
L:  -- so was mine.
R:  -- always integrated, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I ne- I really never experienced it, I guess, like some people experience it, but I -- but I, like you, I find that most of the young -- young people who are in -- in college are very idealistic.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, I'm a -- I'm quite the optimist, but I'm never -- I've never been a idealist, I don't believe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I -- I s- see things more practical --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um --
L:  -- I -- I -- as I've gotten older I've become that way as well and, you know --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- I was --
R:  -- I think most of us --
L:  -- on my own for graduate school and it was just --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah --
R:  So what did you --
L:  -- learning --
R:  -- graduate in?
L:  -- learning the hard way.  Huh?
R:  What did you -- what did you graduate in?
L:  [MN]
R:  What was your major?
L:  Oh, in college, um, economics and co-
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and computer science.  So --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I focused on those two and --
R:  So, you should be doing very well for yourself these days.
L:  I -- I'm doing okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Good.
L:  But, um --
R:  So --
L:  -- I haven't, uh, I really haven't, even in the company that I work at, I've never seen, you know, w- there are mixed races in my department --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there's been no, um, intentional affirmative action policies taken, you know, it's -- it's very much a rigid meritocracy, but it's -- it's, uh, probably unlike most companies because it's, um, u- it's a utility that's owned by the exchanges in it -- in -- in New York and it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a little --a little different, um, in terms of -- of being at your standard for profit company out in the real world, so --
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, I know that, um, the -- I -- I -- I see here, I live in California and here we -- I watch the police department, um, you know, some of the very qualified individuals get passed over for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- minorities --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because it's so [NOISE] -- it's so microscopically watched --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like, you know, they have to just -- they have to o- go -- bend over backwards to make --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sure and I just find that offensive.
L:  Right.
R:  I find that o- offensive that -- that the most qualified person is passed over just because of a quota or a, um, a policy that they have adopted to --
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  -- make sure that nobody gets their feelings hurt.
L:  No, tha- that I -- that I definitely have a problem ...
