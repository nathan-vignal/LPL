L:  Hi, my name is Barb Coney.  Ah, I'm from Austin.
R:  Hi, my name is Lisa Brown.  I'm from South Carolina.
L:  Minnesota.  Ah --
R:  How are you?
L:  I'm just fine.
R:  Great, and what the topic today is public schools?
L:  Right.  I guess -- I have one child in parochial and one in public.  Um, are yours through school or ...?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Are your children -- where -- in school or just --
R:  Yeah, I have one that's in public school.
L:  Are your classes big or --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- how ...?
R:  Um, most of the classrooms they are medium sized but they have decided that they -- they are cutting the budget here and they have decided that, um, they are going to make the classes larger.  So I think it's going to be a big problem next year.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I -- we lost a lot of our state budget went real dif- -- we had a crisis this year, so they tried to keep the money in the public schools but I guess the average class for even at the high school's going to be like thirty to thirty five --
R:  That's a lot --
L:  -- which is going to be --
R:  -- for one class.
L:  It is.  My daughter lives with CP, cerebral palsy, and special ed -- no limits this year so that was -- there tends to be a lot of behavioral problems in special ed classes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So it's -- it's -- it's going to a -- there'll be some real issues.
R:  Oh.
L:  The teachers -- she had some classes this summer and the teacher's already complaining about class sizes [SIGH] but you -- we don't have any money [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess, you know?
R:  I know, me either.  I know -- I know the feeling.  That's what I was thinking with the, um, classes being -- so many students being in the class it's going to be hard for them to actually get to each student and, you know, try to help them if they have a problem individually.
L:  There's just going to be a lot of behavioral issues.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I -- I see that as a big -- my son's in parochial school but, um, the classes are smaller there.  Um, that helps.
R:  Oh, definitely because there they have a chance to be with each student individually if needed.
L:  Ah -- you -- that-- that takes -- a lot is just, um -- if they can just keep -- I'm finding if they can just keep 'em under control --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that seems to be about our biggest issue here.
R:  Oh, yeah, well, that's, you know -- here what these, um, kids -- the middle schools here I think are a b- bigger problem.  With the high school the kids know, you know, they need to learn and try to get it because if they don't get it during school and they have to go to summer school, they have to pay for each class.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, yeah, so I mean a lot of them here they know once they get to high school if they don't pay attention they have to go summer school they're going to have to pay for each class and that's just like eighty dollars, anywhere from fifty to eighty I would say, per class, for summer school.
L:  Oh, so ...  See, we don't have to pay for summer school yet.
R:  See and -- well, here they -- well, not -- not through middle school but once they get to high school then they do.  So ...
L:  And eighty dollars, to come up with that kind of money.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]  Exactly so that's a lot of money for --and, you know, if they have to take two or three classes, we're talking over a hundred dollars right there.
L:  Yeah.  No, our -- and -- and I know there are not our facilities, well, they've been able to keep up so far, you know?  The -- the buildings are good and the books are good.  Our biggest thing is, you know -- is staff.  You know, that's our -- if the classes -- and it's really -- I'm very concerned with special ed because it's such a beha- -- you know, like if you have a kid in high accelerating --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they get high potential kids around 'em.  Like, she gets a lot of -- she's C -- cerebral palsy so she has LD --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and while she needs this behavior -- I mean, the language is -- you know [LAUGH] well --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh my.
L:  -- you have to just say, "You leave your potty mouth at school".  You know, but you have -- they have to talk like that, you know, for acceptance in those classes.  But it -- you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, she gets the lower end period because of that and they're talking [SIGH] you know, and you -- you know, they're not going to mains- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the special ed kids now are probably not going to be mainstreamed because the classes will be so big --
R:  Mm, mm, mm, mm.
L:  -- supported in -- you know, so it's just going to be -- the special ed rooms are going to be awful.
R:  Yeah, that's going to be hard.
L:  And that's where she's going to be.  You know, and they're really going to make a class society I feel.  You know what I mean?  'Cause all the special ed kids tend to be kids with the issues.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And then the cream of the crop will still have, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- so I mean if you got a good kid, they'll do fine.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if you're at the bottom [LAUGH] --
R:  I know.  And -- and then always this -- it's always been like that and then who al- -- who always suffer?  The kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The kids are the ones --
L:  And --
R:  -- that just suffer and I mean, I guess they didn't think about that when they decided they were going -- you know, cut the budget and get rid of teachers.  I think that's the worse thing they can do in the world.
L:  Yeah, 'cause they -- you know, they have the books and the -- no, I look to see some -- but then again I, you know -- I guess public schools are important, but can we support, you know, the big welfare areas?
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?  Or public schools.  It seems like it's one or the other in our state budget.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I -- I -- we're really going to get caught and we were able to use the smoking money.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, they won that big smoking --
R:  Yeah, they were going to, um, tax the cigarettes or something I think.
L:  Right.  And we caught a lot of smoking money this time but it won't be there next time.
R:  No.
L:  And we still got messed up.
R:  And then I saw something the other day, they said that, um, maybe they have something that said about what the state school budget is, um -- that they each start taxing the fast food restaurants, um, some of the burgers -- I don't know what they -- I don't know how they are planning on doing or what they [NOISE] going to plan on doing, but I think that they should not cut the, um, schools because I mean the education is very important, especially these --
L:  Well, you just --
R:  -- kids.
L:  -- banking on the future.  I mean, if you don't pay when they're young you'll pay when they're older.
R:  Exactly, exactly.  And it's just -- it's just a very important part of the future and if they are not going to help us get these kids educated, then it's -- you know, we're going to have to step up and do something ourselves.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, what we can do, I don't know.  I've been -- I've been thinking about that all summer actually, trying to figure out what I can do because my son, he's going to need some special attention.  He's going to need it because he -- he's -- he gets very distracted very easily.
L:  Oh, he'll have a lot of distraction this fall.
R:  Mhm.  So with all those students --
L:  You know what I mean?  'Cause their classes definitely are going to be bigger.
R:  Oh, yeah, and that's not --
L:  So you have one in school?
R:  Yeah, well my daughter just graduated this year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So she's going to college in August.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, but my son he's, um -- he'll be going to high school next year and this will be his first year there.
L:  Okay.
R:  And now with the classes getting larger it's just -- it's just not going to be good for him at all.  I may --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- end up home schooling him, that's what I've been thinking about.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've been thinking about that a lot.  So I don't know what I'm going to do.
L:  Well, if a person can stay on top they got to work some alone but -- I -- I -- my -- you know my daughter did better when I was -- I only worked half time.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You know, and she just -- 'cause I had more time at home.
R:  And yet --
L:  But -- and you know, you don't have to send your kids to school.  I didn't realize that but, you know, the home school -- I mean, they can be home schooled.
R:  Mhm.  And a lot of kids that they home school they seem to do better.
L:  Well, you get your work done and you go do what you have to do.
R:  Yeah.  And it's only just one on one L time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So -- so that would happen.
L:  And you know what you have to get done and --
R:  Mhm.  Send your tests in and get it done, yeah.  I've been thinking about that a lot.  Ah, um, the thing is is with them being at school and me working, you know, it's going to be hard for me to -- I can't just quit my job because, you know -- I'm -- I'm like their only income. [LAUGH]  So --
L:  Yeah, you're in the same situation, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  So --
L:  I think it's mostly -- um, what do you think of public schools?  I think mostly it's money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, if it's going to cost a lot to fund then I guess the person has to decide how -- you know, what simple -- what do we feel is important?  We have to have an education, so then we have to have, ah, you know, a -- a social services too to take care of those people that, you know, just don't fit anywhere.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And we've been able to do that and now we gotta make choices.  And I don't think of them are really easy.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know?  And I know our -- our teachers are strong, I mean as far as they have a -- a good union and that, you know, they were able just to keep what they had --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and get a little more.  But, you know, they're going to want to, you know -- more money so I don't know what's going to happen.  I -- you know, it's just -- you know, [SIGH] [MN] like, you're right, if your child is inattentive and it just depends on how strong your kid is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the pressure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like if they can manage in a bigger classroom 'cause there's a lot more --
R:  Oh, a lot more.  There's -- and like I've said, the teacher's not going to have time to do one on one with them a lot, you know, and my son -- he -- he's going to need that.  I know he is.  I mean, just from --
L:  Where's he at?  He's just finishing a -- yeah.  Guys are like that too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They just -- you know, and in a bigger environment they're just -- that's, you know -- they're going to lose the little boys.  You know, they just will.  They'll shape up when they're seniors but they won't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, guys just -- little kids -- boys are like that.
R:  Yes they are.  Especially when it comes to school and things like that.  They just [SIGH] I don't know.  I mean it's just -- he's -- he did okay in middle school, he did okay.  It's just that his attention span were -- was really bad at one time so he, um -- I got him back in line and he's still -- but, you know, he'll still --
