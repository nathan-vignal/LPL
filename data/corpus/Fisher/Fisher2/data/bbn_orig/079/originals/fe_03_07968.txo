R:  -- Garlina Rutland.
L:  Hi, this is Heather Haney.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm doing good.  I'm sitting here -- [NOISE]
L:  I couldn't hear your name, you said it so quick. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Ah, Garlina Rutland.
L:  Garlina?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, I like that.  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from Colorado.
L:  Colorado?  I'm in Georgia.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, I'm -- I -- you got an opinion on this one?
L:  Something's seriously wrong with the public school system?
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Politics --
R:  Politics. [NOISE]
L:  -- in the public school system.
R:  [NOISE] I see.
L:  I hear a child behind you.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I have four.
L:  You have four?
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  All in the public school system?
R:  Actually all home schooled. [LAUGH]
L:  You're a home school for --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, no. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] So that's why I thought I'd ask if you had an [LAUGH] opinion on this one.
L:  Well, why do you home school versus send 'em to public school?
R:  [NOISE] Well [SIGH] um, I happen to actually -- actually be an African American --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- and, um -- and I have two boys and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- there's a things that I see that are -- I'm not really happy with, but, um, for the most part where I'm from, um, the -- a lot of the -- gosh, the -- the morals, um, in the schools or what the school -- what the, ah, kids are exposed to I'm not real happy with as far as when they're exposed to it.
L:  You mean the mor- -- oh, I see.  Okay. 
R:  Ah, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE] -- I -- I -- some of the things that are -- that they will be exposed to, I'd rather them not be exposed to [LAUGH] so early.  Um, and then, ah, just a- -- when you were saying politics --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- um, my goodness, um, the, ah, N.E.A. I think is, ah, really -- those, ah, the unions, um [LIPSMACK] I don't think they serve the public interest like -- to me, from what I've seen.
L:  You mean the teachers unions?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, the teachers unions.  Um, from the text books that, um, I'm learning so much while I'm home schooling but how they'll, ah, adjust the American history and, um --
L:  Well, yeah, we know that.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I mean, just things that I -- you know, even my parents grew up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- with knowing about history.  And now we've got watered down -- you know, the kids don't know anything.
L:  Well, I happen to live --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- in the county -- I'll tell you what I think is wrong.  I happen to live in the county which I'm sure you've heard about.  It's Cobb County, Georgia --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] -- with the --
R:  [NOISE] My fam- -- I got family -- one family member that was from DeKalb County.
L:  Oh, from DeKalb.  Well, I live in Cobb, so ...
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  You know about the, ah --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- Darwinism [NOISE] scandal down here right?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I think so, yeah.
L:  That's my county where they want to actually -- they're actually saying they don't want it to be sole -- they want creationism --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- taught as well.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  That it's another opinion.  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my. 
L:  So to me -- yeah, I mean, what's wrong with the public school system is they're trying to put too much religion into it when really, you know, Darwinism is a proven proven and creationism is like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, not. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow. 
L:  So I actually live in that county where they've actually allowed that, you know --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- the textbooks are -- it's -- they don't just solely teach about Darwinism.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, and I guess and y- -- and you come from one end of the spectrum and I'm from the other end because I can, um, I've -- that -- that theory can be proven, um, or at least the discussion can come up for a debate and, ah, bringing up scientific facts and that -- I think that's -- I like that part as far as the debate is concerned.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Um, because, ah, there are s- -- a lot of questions in the Darwinism theory --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- and, um -- and -- but my -- I guess my thing is I'm thinking that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- really where we -- where we kind of missed it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- is we did -- I -- I think our n- -- our nation, when we were founded we decided we didn't want to kind of go by what -- what we were founded on.  So we just kind of mixed in a little bit of everything -- ooh, you know, and, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] -- um, because we -- now we don't have the -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- back what -- back in my mom's time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, teachers didn't have to carry guns [LAUGH] you know?  Or -- or anything of that nature or pretty much, um, you know, it was the -- the gum chewing and the, you know, pulling the girls hair and that kind of stuff.
L:  Right.  And well, I have a girlfriend who's a teacher at a -- in a public school system.  I forget which one, PS something in New York City.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
L:  She's doing a program through the state of New York where, you know, they're helping pay for her m- masters and --
R:  [NOISE] Is she?  Oh, I've heard about that one.
L:  Yeah and so that's what she's doing and she's -- so she's teaching at inner city schools --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- and she did such a good job they're actually putting her in the honors class --
R:  [NOISE] Ooh --
L:  -- next semester -- next year.
R:  [NOISE] -- awesome, awesome.
L:  Yeah, so she's actually going to teach an honors class.  But she's young, she's twenty -- twenty three --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, she's -- she's, ah, you know, real -- you know, the -- the school system it's, you know, it's -- the parents aren't reinforcing a lot -- a lot of the parents don't reinforce what the teachers are trying to enforce.
R:  [NOISE] Right, yeah that's --
L:  You know, they're not working --
R:  [NOISE] -- no, that's --
L:  -- together.
R:  [NOISE] You know what?  And you -- you made a valid point there too, um, it's not just the school districts and -- and -- but you've got parents now that have lost the -- the importance of being involved with their children.
L:  Right and even if you're involved, like, um, I have a son -- my son -- my oldest is ADHD and going into fourth grade and he is --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  -- he is -- we have to work a hundred percent with the teacher. 
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  What the teacher says goes.  We may not like it --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- all the time --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- but we still have to back her up because we would be crazy to not.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, he's got to have the -- and she has to back us up --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] So working together.
L:  And from a [inaudible] -- you know, so -- and [NOISE] living in the south I finding -- I'm from Pennsylvania originally --
R:  [NOISE] Ooh.
L:  So, um, schools are a bit different down here.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And we just happen -- because we live in Cobb County we live -- we live in, ah, the top elementary school in the state district.
R:  [NOISE] Ah.  Oh, I --
L:  We looked for it specifically.  You know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- we tried to find a house in there.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, we got a nice older home in that district and I tell you what, this -- it's politically -- it's -- it's still difficult. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yes, I can believe it.  I believe it.
L:  So, I mean, ah, we have another friend who teaches at one of the local middle schools and he says the politics is killing him.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I believe it.  I --
L:  Because, you know, they want to teach and they're forced to teach, you know, things that, you know, don't make sense or they're testing the kids on stuff that, you know, they don't need [LAUGH] to be tested on.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.
L:  Basing everything on test scores versus --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- versus actual learning.
R:  [NOISE] Right.  Well, yeah and I guess you'd have to strike a -- I'm glad that the discussion is going though as far as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- the schools are concerned, because I wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- i- it's at least a --
L:  How old are your --
R:  -- I know it's --
L:  -- how old are your children?
R:  Um, I've got one that's almost ten, five, ah, almost --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- four and eighteen months.
L:  Wow.  Yeah, I've got me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one who's about eighteen months, a two year old [NOISE] and a nine year old, he just turned nine.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  If he makes it to ten he'll be lucky. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Well, I know the thing [LAUGH] is --
L:  You know -- [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, you got a boy then, huh?
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.
R:  Yeah, well, and see if -- now there's some other dynamics --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with me being African American, um, that play a -- a role too in my boys --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- because I noticed, um -- I noticed while I was home schooling that [SIGH] um -- that the -- some of -- some of the way that they lay out the schools -- the teaching of schools [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] -- is really geared for girl thinking.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Boys don't just sit and read and -- and write all day.
L:  No they don't.
R:  [NOISE] And -- but they -- but they structure it in that fashion and so when the boys act like boys then they say, "Well, they're ADHD and they're hyped and they can't sit still", and it's like, "No, you've -- you've got this designed for teaching girls".
L:  Right, exactly.  I know when we were in -- when we like -- we -- we firmly believe that too.  They definitely -- you know, boys that -- will be boys.  I mean, our son is, you know, di- -- is -- is seriously ADHD, you know?  
R:  [NOISE] Ah.
L:  We -- but we stayed in denial for his first couple of years.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And school is saying, you know, "No, he's a boy". [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, until finally medically he really is --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, right.
L:  -- you kn- -- you know?  And I'm on the -- I treat him naturally.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, good.  See -- well, I congratulate you.
L:  -- yeah, no I'm not -- I'm not -- he -- we tried the drug system --
R:  [NOISE] Did you?
L:  -- and that -- yeah, and it was just awful.
R:  [NOISE] It's horrible.  I did a -- I did a, um --
L:  He stopped growing.
R:  [NOISE] He did?
L:  Yeah, he didn't eat and he stopped growing and he --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- went off of it and grew like three inches and --
R:  [NOISE] I -- I went -- I did one of those, ah -- not [inaudible], um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] What is that thing they partner with?  I can't remember off the top of my head.  It's a community, ah, thing that they partner and they'll do, like, um -- [LIPSMACK] like a social studies unit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- or something.  I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- um, ah, junior achievement.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] And a -- a -- we we- -- I went to one of the schools that was one of the poorest in the district.  They would take the Red Cross kids.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] And I -- it broke my heart to see these kids medicated -- some of 'em medicated and they were brilliant. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] And the teachers just -- for control -- and these were mostly boys.  The boys were [LAUGH] medicated and I'm like, "This is ridiculous".  I'm on the phone, not now.  Anyway, um, and so I just -- I don't know, there's just something's not the same [LAUGH] --
L:  No, like they shouldn't --
R:  [NOISE] -- I'm like, "I'm not going to --"
L:  -- they need to be rambunctious and doing everything, and I think boys learn in more of an active environment.
R:  [NOISE] Have you -- is -- does your district do, or, ah, your county do the -- I've heard about them splitting the classes where they have just te- -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, girls classes and boys classes?
L:  No, they haven't done that yet.  
R:  [NOISE] I've heard some good stuff about that.
L:  You know, I think they learn well like that as well, but with --
R:  [NOISE] Because it's less of a distraction.
L:  We- well, that and -- but what I'm finding, which is actually good for someone like my son --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the school district is that when he has -- they -- that so far in every class he's been in --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- they always end up putting him be- -- in between two girls because the girls actually help him [LAUGH] stay more controlled.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  They help him -- like, ah, his -- like at his birthday party he had one girl who sat next to him for most of the year this year because she kept him under -- I mean he's -- he's really socially improved --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- it's just he -- he has a tough time, you know, focusing and reading and --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, right.
L:  -- keeping his desk clean and --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and she actually bought him a hot wheels, you know, ah --
R:  [NOISE] Ah.
L:  -- car makers kit because she said, "Well, I know you like playing with your cars in your desk all s- --"
