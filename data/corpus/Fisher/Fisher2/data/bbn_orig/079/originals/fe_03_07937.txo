L:  [SIGH]  Hello?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hi, I'm Sal.
L:  Hi, Sal, I'm Yvonne.  I'm from Florida.  How are you today?
R:  A- ah, good, nice to meet you.  I'm from Tennessee.  [NOISE]
L:  Likewise.  [LIPSMACK]  I --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  -- I think it's neat [SIGH] talking to people from other places.  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, it's good --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to at least hear what they have to say and just meeting new people.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, I am, -- ah, definitely have problems with the public school system.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  M- my children ... all go to, ah, private Christian s- [LAUGH] schools.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, my biggest pet peeve [MN] [COUGH] at least in -- in the central Florida area, [SIGH] is that, [SIGH] um, the +school -- school systems really seem to have a problem [SIGH] with t- the kids speaking ye- -- openly, [LIPSMACK] um, about their, [LIPSMACK] um, Christian convictions or any religious convictions and, [SIGH] you know, I've even had my children [SIGH] reprimanded at lunch time when they'd q- quietly say grace at -- at lunch.  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah, and it's just outlandish, you know.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] and then they're -- they're being taught, ah, the theory of [SIGH] evolution as if it [SIGH] were factual and it's only a theory but yet they can't [SIGH] express their own ideas or opinions on their religious beliefs, so that really ticks me.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [SIGH]  Huh, that's interesting.  Um, [LIPSMACK] well I'm only twenty four so I don't have any children in school.
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  But, ah, I went to public school all my life [NOISE] and it -- you know, I didn't get the -- to me there's two types -- types of public school.  There's an [SIGH] inner city public school --
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- where you hear all the stories about --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- teachers getting attacked or you -- the low test scores or what not.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, the funding problems and then there's the +suburban [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- public school that's, [SIGH] you know, kids with their BMWs which you kind of see glamorized in Hollywood.  I was kind of in between.  I wasn't [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the rich of the rich but I wasn't, you know, the average middle class.  [LIPSMACK]  Um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in my school I really didn't see that many problems but my mom's actually a teacher and all she's ever taught were at, you know, city schools.
L:  Right.
R:  We used to live in Memphis --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- so she taught in the Memphis city and now she's in Cincinnati.  But [SIGH] I know with her s- she complains and I -- I tend to agree that s- some of the funding for the city schools isn't as good, ah, over crowded --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [SIGH] classrooms and then kind of [LIPSMACK] -- I kind of think I -- and I know a lot of people ... d- disagree with me but, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, when I was in elementary school you could be paddled and disciplined --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- not, you know, not beat up or anything like that but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at least kind of, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, put back in your place and even now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] with a lot of parents don't want their kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- being, ah, disciplined by teachers or principals or what not and I can -- [SIGH] I can see where they're coming from.  But I think a lot of kids --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- realize now that, you know, they might get de- detention --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or suspended but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're not, you know, there's no chance that they will physically ... have any consequences.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think t- that [SIGH] -- it's not -- I don't think it's a huge problem but I think if that came back there might be a little more [SIGH] ... discipline in school like there should be.  I think it's gotten a little [SIGH] out of hand with ... k- kids attacking teachers or teachers even attacking kids to defend themselves or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what not.  [SIGH]  But, ah --
L:  [MN]  Well, I -- I concur with some of the things you've said.  I -- I've been on both ends of the s- +spectrum [SIGH] when I was going to public school.  I -- I went --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- to school in an inner city [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- ah, kind of environment and then we moved to the burbs, [SIGH] you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  [NOISE]  Um, [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] however I was fortunate in that I -- I went to two very good schools that had a lot of, um, [LIPSMACK] -- had a lot of resources and had a lot of, [SIGH] um, interaction from ... t- the parents and people in the community that made the school better.  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  I also have friends that do teach in the public school system as well.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [MN]
L:  And [SIGH] it's very true that -- and [SIGH] some of the more economically esp- -- most of the more economically deprived areas [SIGH] there are less services available for the kids.  [SIGH]  Um, I think t- the disciplinary problems that we're having here is not so much so from [SIGH] the parents as it is [LIPSMACK] from, um, the Department of Children and Family, [SIGH] um, --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- getting involved.  Yeah, and, um, I think with, [SIGH] ah, the way [SIGH] -- w- we're so much more busier now it seems in our society than we were-- than it was back [SIGH] when we were growing up that, [SIGH] you know, it's like f- families are constantly on the go.
R:  R- right.
L:  [MN]  I think, like, fifty percent of -- of families are being raised [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by single parent households as well so that makes it even more hectic.  [SIGH]  And so [SIGH] they're not really there, [SIGH] um, you know, parents aren't there as much on a consistent basis to offer, [SIGH] you know, a consistent type of +discipline, not only a, you know, a physical +discipline [SIGH] but just, y- you know, being able to reinforce the values and, [SIGH] you know, set it up as good an example as they might have been [SIGH] if they could --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- spend more time with their kids.  And I think that's having a -- an enormous impact as well.  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]
R:  I agree.  Also --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a- a- getting through for an also word, single families, even the two headed families --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- m- most of them are working --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- whereas, you know, the whole concept and phenomenon of watching kids --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- has just happened in the last ten or fifteen years where you're coming home and watching after yourself until five, five thirty, six at the earliest.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, it's -- and then by then, you know, ... p- parents come home you eat dinner, watch a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- TV and then it's time for bed so there's no real --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] quality time, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe forty or fifty years ago [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or even twenty, I don't know.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I think a lot of the family values that really m- meshed our families together to work as units, you know, [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- were, you know, parents offered reinforcement, [SIGH] -- you know, reinforcing each others values with their children, that's really lacking in our society and it's just trickling [SIGH] through all aspects, you know, [SIGH] including [SIGH] you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the education system.  [LIPSMACK]  And, ah, [SIGH] so that, you know, I think that's got a- another bit to do with it.  [SIGH]  And it --
R:  So, --
L:  -- does make it much harder on teachers because, you know, with the budgets dropping [LIPSMACK] they have [SIGH] a lot more students so the -- the ratio is m- much higher [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, y- you know, and there's less attention that they can give them.  And they're also dealing with [SIGH] disciplinary problems, you know, that should have really been overcome at home and maybe ev- -- never been there to start with [SIGH] if they had, [SIGH] ah, you know, a more solid family foundation at home, [NOISE] you know.  [SIGH]
R:  Sure I completely agree with that.  So, ah, y- you have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kids in private schools and you've experienced the public schools.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think makes ... the private schools -- because right now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot -- most of the people you see that go to private schools say it's much better than public schools --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and looking at the numbers you have to tend to agree with the [NOISE] higher test scores and what not.  What would you say -- what would the public schools have to kind of model, what should they take from the private schools?
L:  Well, I think a big thing is that [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] one [SIGH] -- see, ah, in my children's school [MN] they're really is n- no physical discipline, you know.
R:  Right.  Sure.
L:  Um, a- at home our physical discipline is they drop and give us fifty [SIGH] situps [SIGH] if -- if we have to constantly remind them, [SIGH] you know, to -- to follow through with their tasks or they're trying to be defiant then, you know, we feel that [SIGH] that's -- ah, you know, in itself a positive reinforcement, because they're doing something physical and giving themselves time and they're doing [SIGH] something healthy --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know.  [SIGH]  Versus getting a spank or whatever [SIGH] which really isn't going to give them anything very much positive.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  There's a lot of parental interaction, [SIGH] you know.  [SIGH]  And then we have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] t- the parents at their school -- or the families [SIGH] they come from all different socio economic, [SIGH] um, you know, ranges of the spectrum [SIGH] you know, and all different nationalities and backgrounds and what not.  [SIGH]  But the one common bond that they have [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] is that they -- they're all [SIGH] -- well for the most part, most of us [SIGH] are dedicated towards raising our children [LIPSMACK] with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, a Christian type of outlook [SIGH] you know.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And -- and we re- reinforce those [SIGH] activities [LIPSMACK] or, you know, [SIGH] those, ah, [SIGH] those same things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we want to instill in them through the different things that we do in every day life [SIGH] you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  And, so [LIPSMACK] there's a lot of parent involvement, [SIGH] you know.  And, ah, [SIGH] the teachers also -- [SIGH] not only the teachers but all the people that work in -- in the school that my children attend now [SIGH] they really love the kids, you know, as -- as in the act of loving the children [SIGH] you know.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and they're very [SIGH] gentle and loving and kind and, [SIGH] you know, if they have to see -- if they have a problem with t- the kids with -- with anything [SIGH] they let you know right away.  And they sit the child down and they talk it out with the child and, [SIGH] you know, they really show a concern, [LIPSMACK] you know, or they'll call us at home or whatever, but it's -- [SIGH] it's taken care of immediately, it's not something that's put off on the back burner and [SIGH] you know.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I think that probably -- like, you're saying you talked a lot about dedication --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you see in the private schools [SIGH] and I wonder if some of that dedication [SIGH] u- um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of goes back to the parental values and some of the public schools that are having problems to where they just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of think of school as, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "That's eight hours I don't have to deal with".  Maybe not that harshly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and maybe that's way too pessimistic but at least, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "That's eight hours where --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- I don't have to have the responsibility of the kid I can learn more about [SIGH] --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- you know, putting food on the table or things I need to get done" and maybe they're not as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] they're more dedicated to survival than to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of fostering a nurse --
