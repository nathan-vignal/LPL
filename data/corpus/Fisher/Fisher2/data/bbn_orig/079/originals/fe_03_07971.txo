R:  Andy.
L:  Susan.
R:  Hi there.
L:  Hey.
R:  Um, so, w- w- we're just supposed to be talking about the school system, I take it.  So, you know, [MN] I went to Dallas Oregon and, uh, I really think it really s- I -- I thought it was o- okay, but, you know, they're talking about gays' rights and stuff like that and I really, I don't think that's right.  But, uh, the thing is, is that, um, I -- I really -- I'm -- I have a wife now, I just got married today and, um, [NOISE] she's, um, she has kids that are disabled and, um, they're here, they go to school here in Salem, Oregon and she says that, um, s- Salem is like one of the best schools districts around.  She's from Utah and so, um, I'm [MN], you know.  How 'bout -- w- how 'bout your family?  What do you think?  What [MN] ...
L:  What do I think?
R:  Yeah, what do you think?
L:  Well, what area are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Salem, Oregon.
L:  Mm.
R:  And how 'bout you?
L:  I'm calling from Salem also.
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  So, you're familiar with the Salem kinds of[?] schools.
R:  Yeah, just a little, my wife's from there -- from, um, has kids going to school, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, uh --
L:  So do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- participate in the school activities with the children?  Do you go --
R:  Do I?
L:  -- programs, are you involved with their teachers?
R:  I'm not, my wife is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, uh, we just had a major here, that, um, a lot of the money that, uh, was going to the schools district, um, isn't going there and I think that, um, if -- if, um, if we really loved our kids and stuff like that we'd find a way to, uh, to, um, [MN] see about getting the education that they have a lot better than it was and is today, um, you know.  We're the only state that doesn't pay ta- taxes on their groceries, you know?  What d'you -- you know, why can't we have a tax on our groceries so the tax that's on our groceries could go to the schools?  You know, um, there's a lottery here, why can't some of that money go to support the schools?  You know?  Tha- that -- i- it's like Oregon doesn't really care about their kids, i- it really sucks, I don't know.  Um, [MN] have you had a problem like that, or what do you think a- about, um -- so, you said you're from Oregon, what do you think about the Measure twenty -- thirty eight that didn't go through?  Or Measure --
L:  Measure --
R:  -- thirty nine?
L:  -- eight?
R:  What?
L:  It didn't go through, but it's, like, being reevaluated in a school district.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- trial that, um, programs in Salem.
R:  Right, now did you hear about Portland School District?  That they, um, that there they, um, the people that work in Portland, um, will pay an extra tax and s- and it goes exactly to the schools and so, like, [MN] my family's thinking about moving to Portland and -- and if I get a job in Portland, I'd be paying an extra tax while --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I'm working and that money goes to support the schools, you know, I think that -- that's pretty cool.  But that's only for the Portland district.  That's only for, like, Washington County and -- and a couple of other counties up in Portland area that, uh, will support the schools, you know.  So, w- what do you think about that?
L:  Well, from my understanding, I -- I understand the high schools are cut back one day a week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so they only go Monday through Thursday.
R:  Oh, r- oh, I see.  Is that here in Salem, or --
L:  And then they --
R:  -- or --
L:  -- only go half a day on Friday --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- here in Salem.
R:  Mm.  Interesting.  Hang on for a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- minute, I gotta turn this phone up, hang on. [NOISE] Okay, now I think I can hear you.  Um, [MN] uh, interesting.  Um, the thing is, is that, um, my dad used to teach and -- in Monmouth, Oregon --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, he -- he's -- he's said some interesting things about the schooling system, um, he believes, you know, that, um, I should've had more homework, you know, and, you know, I -- I believe that I should've, [MN] you know, um, I -- I was a special student, I had to -- I didn't know how to read very well and I bet you if my dad got his way I'd be able to read a whole lot better than I do now.  And -- and I think the teachers should buckle down and, um, start, uh, um [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- caring about the students instead of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and putting homework --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I don't --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- think it's, like, the, uh, the -- the teachers that have any involvement, I think it's the funding that limits the teachers in their abilities --
R:  But --
L:  -- and how --
R:  -- but the --
L:  -- they do things.
R:  -- but, [MN] tha- that could be, but they're, you know, they're getting paid to teach and they're not doing nothing, they're not -- the -- do- how many kids do you have?
L:  Four.
R:  Four kids and -- and do they ha- do they bring homework every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- night home?
L:  No.
R:  No, okay.  Why not?  Why don't they bring homework?  You know, [MN] I make my wife's [MN] kids, I -- I think that my wife's kids should read for an hour at home every single night, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that would teach, you know, it's part of our duty as a parent to -- to teach our kids how to read and how to -- it's not all the pa- teachers, you got a point there, but the thing is, is that it would help the t- parents out if we had materials coming home that we could teach our kids, you know?  The teachers can get us involved in teaching our kids also, and getting them to read and st- and doing math and still -- stuff like that.  And so, um, [MN] you know, it's kinda hard for me to talk about this subject, 'cause I really -- I don't really get involved with my wife's kids, because that's her kids and they don't really listen to me, so -- so it's -- and, you know, i- it's -- it's kinda hard.  Well, do you get your kids to read, or wha- what do you -- what do you do in this situation?
L:  What do I do this situation?
R:  Yes.
L:  I read to them.
R:  You read to them?  Well, does that teach them anything?  It doesn't teach them anything.
L:  But they're listening, so that --
R:  [MN] They're --
L:  -- is -- that's effective.
R:  That's [SIGH] I don't know, because it -- they doesn't --
L:  There's pleasure --
R:  -- teach --
L:  -- in reading and you're reading and, you know, and if you, like, take time out and let them sound out the words with you while you're reading with them, you know, that has quality time in by itself.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  So, what else are we supposed to be talking about?  I'm new to this line, this is only like my second day to do this.  I heard that you get, like, thirty bucks for doing this, so, I was like, "Why not?", um, but, um, so --
L:  Just --
R:  -- I'm gonna -- I'm, um --
L:  You have to --
R:  --what --
L:  -- wait until the recording comes on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the recording comes on and tells you that you have, like, thirty seconds left --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then it goes down and then, it tells you goodbye off the line.
R:  Oh, I see.  I see.  So --
L:  How's the --
R:  -- what are -- are --
L:  -- how's the weather out there in your backyard?
R:  What?
L:  How's the weather out there in your backyard?
R:  Oh, how did you know I was in my -- in the backyard?
L:  'Cause you can hear the echo on the telephone.
R:  Oh. [LAUGH] Yeah.  I -- I'm really enjoying my backyard, it's really a nice sky out there.
L:  [MN]
R:  You must not live very far from me.
L:  Oh --
R:  But, uh, anyways --
L:  No, I guess.
R:  -- [MN] the schools, you know, I -- [MN] I think private schools teach much better than -- than normal schools do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so --
L:  Well, basically if a school had -- the schools had more funding and more teachers and more time, the children would have more quality services and a lot better teaching.  So, the bottom line basically facts is that, the -- the state needs to get their -- their head out of their ass and start funding the schools before it's too late.
R:  But how are they going to fund these schools if -- if --
L:  Well, we have a huge budg- budget deficit where they can take out things in other places, you know, they fund the rich people well they -- they can unfund the rich people and start funding schools.
R:  [MN] Yeah, but that's not fair for the, uh, for the rich -- rich people and -- and you know, the, uh, government --
L:  It's not fair --
R:  -- tries to protect --
L:  -- for the rich people?  Well, basically, you know, if they tax the -- the richer, richer, you know, upper class people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that -- that make over two hundred thousand dollars a year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they can afford to pay a little higher tax.
R:  But -- but -- but they don't want to, because they think they're better than all of us.
L:  No, not necessarily, some of the richest people can be the nicest people.
R:  W- that -- that could be true but, the most rich people that I met are snobs and they do- they wouldn't care about anything else but their money.
L:  Oh --
R:  You know, I -- I think McDonald's has a good program ...
