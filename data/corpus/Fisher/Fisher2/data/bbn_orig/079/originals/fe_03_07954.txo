R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  How are you?
L:  Hey.  [LAUGH] How are you doing?
R:  I'm doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty good.  How are you?
L:  All right.  What --
R:  I --
L:  -- did they say about -- wh- -- I couldn't hardly hear.  My kids were going in the background.
R:  It said that you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had to talk about public --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- schools --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you think there is anything seriously wrong with the public schools.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  I thought if it in New York and I was like, "Okay".
R:  Yeah, I'm an expert on that.
L:  Huh.  [NOISE]
R:  I'm in Michigan.
L:  Oh, okay.  No, I'm in, um, Charlotte.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  That's --
L:  I thought the end of the topic said, "public schools --" [NOISE] "-- in New York".  [NOISE]
R:  Ah.
L:  Because my kids were going in the background.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually I'm -- I'm almost done with my -- my education --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm gonna be a fourth grade teacher.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  In a public school.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I kinda have a little bit of an opinion as to --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- as to this topic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, well, I know that there's a major problem with public schools --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in our area.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just like funding has been cut and there's --
L: [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- been so many --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- problems with that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Like the criteria to get teachers in and --
L:  Yeah, they --
R:  -- lack of jobs.
L:  -- don't have the money to pay for the [MN] -- for the e- the education -- for the teachers to actually teach the education.  [NOISE]
R:  Absolutely.
L:  So, it's like the teachers, they're getting in there, are not really teaching.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they're just [NOISE] kinda like throwing something up on a chalkboard and then when they get to the end of the year, half the kids are failing.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] You know.
R:  And then they don't know why.
L:  And they're wondering why.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Because there's no communication between --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- the parents and the teachers.
L:  [NOISE] No, no.  And then [NOISE] now what they're doing too is they'll give out the homework and they don't even grade it.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, in the high schools because that's where my sister went through.
R:  Huh.
L:  When she was in high school, the teacher would give out the homework but yet they're saying like, during the midterm, uh, progress reports [NOISE] that she's, like, [NOISE] not satisfactory.  [NOISE]
R:  Huh.
L:  So, [NOISE] b- and my mama's like, "Okay, well, she don't understand what's going on".  And they're like, [NOISE] "Well, we give out the home- -- you know, we give out homework".  And my mom's like, "Well, are you all checking it?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They not even -- they're not even checking it so they're just [NOISE] -- she's just passing back the paper to the students with a check mark and not c- checking or nothing, so they're thinking that whatever they put on there is right.
R:  Right.
L:  I was like, "That's the stupidest thing I ever heard".  [NOISE]
R:  That's the stupidest thing I've --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- ever heard.
L:  [NOISE] You gonna give out homework and you not gonna check it then, how you -- you know, how you know [MN] what the kids know.  Because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's the way you could tell from their homework.  
R:  What a way to have a job, huh?
L:  [SIGH] It is.
R:  Do nothing.
L:  And that's how some of the teachers are, and you have to get on 'em.  That's why [NOISE] -- and see, I have twins so I say --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  Lord, woman --
R:  Bless your heart.
L:  -- I g- when they get to school, boy, them teachers gonna hate me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I'm gonna be all over them.  Because I --
R:  W- --
L:  -- wanted to go to the teacher, parent conference with my momma though.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause I'm like, "How's she --" [NOISE] "-- giving out homework if she's not checking it?"  That makes no sense.  That sounds like she just giving 'em stuff to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  [NOISE]
R:  Well --
L:  And --
R:  -- I think that lack of funding has a -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has a really big --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- impact.
L:  [SIGH] [NOISE] But there's -- now, I know in Charlotte they're -- they're doing a big boost up like hire teachers and [NOISE] 'cause [NOISE] one place -- see I'm from Miami, but in Charlotte, it's like every [NOISE] corner, there is a school.  I know we have schools in Miami but we don't have this many.  [NOISE] But they have a [MN] high need for, um, teachers but, you know, the pay is so bad but they've been doing like this big boost.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  
L:  [NOISE] You know, giving like, um, severance packages of stuff to get people on.  [NOISE]
R:  What is, um -- what is the starting pay?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you know?
L:  [NOISE] No.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's like -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it's like thirty one thousand, thirty two thousand here.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] Well, that -- that sound about right here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which isn't two bad but [MN] the expectation is really high.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] Yeah.
R:  You know, they put, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- children's life is in your future.  You know.
L:  I know.
R:  And then, you know, it's -- you can make and break it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And you know, in, um, Miami, they're having a problem now because they have those tests for the kids to test out of the high schools.  And half of the kids in the schools are failing [NOISE] because the teachers are not teaching what's on the test.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, it's like to graduate, they have to pass like a exit exam and half of the students can -- are not graduating because they can't pass the darn exit exam.
R:  That -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- cruel.
L:  So, they have this [NOISE] big thing going on big time down there.  Because when I was at school, we didn't have that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But, you know, I'm like -- I'm all for it if they wanna do an exit exam.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But you need to teach --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  You gotta teach what's on the exam.
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  You know, [MN] every teacher teaches different things.  No one t- teacher, no class teaches the same.  There's no two subjects teach the same thing.
R:  Exactly.
L:  'Cause, I mean -- mean, many times I was in a class and a friend of mine was in -- you know, in another teacher English [NOISE] class and we both doing two -- doing two different things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's like -- what [MN] -- how you going to start -- do a test at the end of the year if you got ten teachers in there and everybody teaching something different.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, they have a -- an exam in Michigan and it's called the MEAT and it's the Michigan Education Assessment --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Processing Test or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it -- it's kind of like the same thing but they take the -- they start taking it in like grade three.
L:  Oh.
R:  And everybody has to take it and it -- yeah, it's like how much funding the state will get and that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of thing.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it's -- it's huge.  Teachers have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to teach to gear children towards that test.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I -- they do it in college.  You have to take an entr -- an exit exam.  
L:  Where at?  In Michigan?
R:  Well, in most colleges, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially like in --
L:  Well, not a major- -- not a lot of them now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Not a lot of them.  'Cause I went to Clark Atlanta University and we didn't have to take one.
R:  Huh.  What is -- what was your major.
L:  Computer science.
R:  Yeah, see mine's education and so, I guess, that that would be -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- only make sense.
L:  Yeah, yeah, [NOISE] and plus you get, um -- [NOISE] I know the one thing they are doing for the teachers that -- you'd, um -- they'll pay for your, um, loan.
R:  Oh, yeah, exactly, [MN] um --
L:  So, that's a plus.  
R:  In Nevada --
L:  You know, I mean, they could do that for every major.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. 
L:  'Cause I -- I sick of these --
R:  Isn't that the truth?
L:  -- student loans.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, I think the thing is it's so hard to find someone to teach because we have to go to school every year for the rest of our lives pretty much.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, 'cause you have --
R:  You know, and --
L:  -- to keep so many credit hours and all that.
R:  Exactly.  And, er, you have to pay for it out of your own pocket.
L:  Yeah, so they kinda like balance it and either way they're gonna get it back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because if they start you off low they're paying for your -- you know, your student loan so [NOISE] at least you get a, you know -- you can kinda live.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's like, you have to live on whatever salary they give you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No matter how low it is.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Well, I know in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Nevada, they're -- they're offering packages [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, paying off the student --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- loans in X. amount of years if you sign a contract and they'll help pay for your mortgage.
L:  Oh, well, that's good.
R:  Yeah, so it's kinda interesting to see if, you know -- how many people will actually do that.
L:  Yeah, they got -- they got a l- -- but the state, see they're binding you in a contract +too, too.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  That's another --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- thing --
R:  -- if you think about it, they're paying off your student loans within a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- five year --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, period.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, it's totally worth it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, true.  Do you mind what state?  I mean, you figure wherever you start, you gonna try to stay there at least five years.  And with teaching -- teachers don't move around.
R:  Yeah, well, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause you wanna get your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tenure in.
L:  Yeah, you -- but teachers don't really move around.  They usually stay, you know, [NOISE] right at the same school.  The only way they leave is if something happens and then if they leave, they be like, "Okay".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  What is going on?  [NOISE] But most teachers, [NOISE] if anything, they might go up to another grade, or wanna teach in high school versus elementary, but it's not gonna be like a big change.
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] 'Cause I --
R:  Yeah, I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know that there's so many problems --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right now, it's like -- it's through our schools in Michigan just because of the budget cuts.  You know, they're taking away like the extra programs.  Like art and music and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that kind of thing and there's a big debate over, you know, what it --
L:  What should stay and what should go.
R:  Yeah, and y- --
L:  Oh, man.
R:  -- you know, and -- they keep all the sports programs but they don't --
L:  I know.  Of course, they wanna keep that junk.
R:  Well, uh, here -- well, you know --
L:  And they have five hundred --
R:  -- I think sports are good --
L:  -- kids on the --
R:  -- but [MN] [MN] --
L:  But --
R:  -- if you have five hundred -- 
R:  I don't understand
L:  -- kids on the football field.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, on --
R:  Instead of having --
L:  -- the football team.
R:  -- them in the classroom.
L:  It's not that serious.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  If they come out of school and they can't read.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, what I mean.
R:  Yeah, and then they see the scoreboard and they're like, "Who's that?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly, I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I feel --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the same way and --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's ridiculous.  I mean, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't mind them doing the sports but they just need to limit it.
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  'Cause some -- I mean, at my high school, we had like every sport.  And I have seen, like at some high schools, they really had like everything.  Like from swimming, you know, to all of that stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean we just had the basic stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think we had like -- yeah, we didn't have swimming or anything.  It was like volleyball, basketball, [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, yeah, just the basics.
R:  We didn't even have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like the, uh --
L:  Yeah, see we had cheerleading.
R:  -- baseball or anything like that.
L:  Yeah, we had cheerleading, badminton and baseball.  But, you know, some of those have, um, swimming, then they have that thing where you hit the little thing -- the ball, [NOISE] so they kinda go out far out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] So, I think if they just minimize it and kinda limit it.
R:  Well, you don't need to get new uniforms every year either.
L:  Yeah, that too.
R:  You know, [SIGH].
L:  [SIGH] I mean --
R:  Change --
L:  -- they're gonna all say the same thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I just -- I just think it's so ridiculous.  I mean, all the debates right now in cutting all the education programs yet they build like more and more prisons every single day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  And then they're running out of prison space.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  But they treating them like kings in there too.  Or kings and queens.
R:  Yeah, we, um -- we -- I live in a conservancy.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like this big, you know, open land area.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they're wanting to build a -- a big prison.
L:  Ooh.
R:  Like a twelve million dollar prison in the middle of this, like w- [SIGH] -- I don't know, in this middle of this like reservoir.  You know, it's like animal reservation.
L:  They want to do it like, um -- what did they call it?  Attica?  Something I saw.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And --
L:  Like in the middle --
R:  -- people are like --
L:  -- of a ocean.
R:  -- "Why don't we get a school now?"  You know, why -- why -- why a big huge prison.  And it -- the crime is so low here.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, nobody locks --
L:  Well, what --
R:  -- their doors.
L:  -- the world are they doing?
R:  Nobody locks their doors.  Nobody locks their -- people leave their cars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- running for a hour when they run into the grocery store.
L:  It sounds like they have -- they just have money to do something with.
R:  Yeah, and they don't wanna do it with education.
L:  That's stupid.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] They just want people to leave their car running.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, crime --
R:  I know, exactly.
L:  -- is really low there.  Because people leave their car doors, oh, um, unlocked here are like dodos.  And then when they come out, it's gone.  [LAUGH] And they'd be like, "What happened?"  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.  [SIGH] I know.
L:  So, then they h- -- they call the police and the police give them the ticket.  
R:  Er --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause you, you know -- they tell --
