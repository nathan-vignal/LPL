R:  Hi, my name is Elizabeth.
L:  Hi, I'm Sherry.
R:  Hi, I'm from New York.
L:  Oh, I'm from -- well, I'm living in Maryland now.  I used to live in Rhode Island.
R:  I'm heading out to Maryland tomorrow.  Baltimore.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So, the topic is ...?
L:  Public school --
R:  The --
L:  -- I think.
R:  -- public school.
L:  Do you have any children?
R:  Uh, no I don't.  [MN]
L:  Okay.  I --
R:  But I have two nephews.
L:  Okay.  
R:  Mhm.
L:   Do they go to a public school?
R:  They go to public school.  Um, the -- well, the one is now in college.  The other one, he's, um -- he's still in -- he's still in grade school.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, how I really feel today that the teachers are not really keeping focus on the kids.  Uh, they're not really getting the proper teaching attention.  Uh, like right now with my nephew, he's very slow in all the, um, academic courses.
L:  Really?
R:  And my sister has to really stretch to try to find another outside program, which costs money to get him to upgrade himself to his school level.
L:  Oh.
R:  See, when we was going to school, w- we was -- we was really [MN] -- you know, what I'm saying -- we was constantly get- -- consistently getting test after test.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] -- and we came out fine because, you know, I'm -- I graduated as I said, nineteen seventy four.
L:  Okay.
R:  So ...  [NOISE] So, but what you think?
L:  Yeah, well, I went to public school as a kid, um, through junior high.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And found [MN] you know, it was a good education.  I did go to a Catholic high school.
R:  Okay.
L:  Though, and, um, it was great for me just because it was all girls and I was kinda shy.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that helped out a lot for me.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, the public schools, um, in our area, they have been a little controversial, I guess.  There's --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- been a lot of parents who haven't been satisfied.  So, we are sending our kids to a Catholic school in our area.
R:  You have kids?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  I have a six year old --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- who just finished kindergarten at Catholic school.
R:  Oh.
L:  And then I also have a -- a -- almost eleven month old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, I guess what I like about private school versus public is they are allowed to discipline more.
R:  [MN] True.
L:  And if kids are amazingly unruly, they can kick them out.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  So, you do have less distractions like that in the classroom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that, in public school, it's probably gotten to the point where a lot of teachers can be intimidated by students at times and don't really have any course of action to take.
R:  No, and now that they --
L:  That --
R:  -- call nine one one.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I -- I feel that that's something I did not want to have to expose my kids to.
R:  Okay.  But see I --
L:  So ...
R:  -- think it's not really just the teachers alone.  [COUGH] I think family -- families should be more supportive.  They really [MN] b- take an interest on --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- what really goes on in the schools.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, you know, I know my sister, she's very strong minded, she's -- she's smart, she stays in the school system.  She has friends that's in the school system.  They -- they're like rebels, you know what I'm saying.  They're like, "What's going on here?"  You know what I'm saying.  "Why is my child going to school every day and, um --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- he got perfect attendance and ..." -- and what's going wrong -- whats gone -- he has a learning disability.
L:  Ah.
R:  And it's -- it's coming from they're not getting the proper teaching in schools.  The teachers are not teaching like when we went to school.
L:  Right.
R:  In public schools.  Uh, [LIPSMACK] Catholic school -- I've never been to Catholic school but I believe my first nephew w- came up in Catholic school and he is a little up -- you know, he's in college now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we have fear for the little one that, you know, he may not even make it that far because he's s- -- he has a very slow learning disability.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um -- [LIPSMACK] and --
L:  There's supposed to be so many resources for them in public schools but ...
R:  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  It's just that, um, you know, he can read, he can write and everything but it just it seem like he's not up to his grade level.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um -- and -- and -- we're the -- you know -- as my sister's a parent I think she would love to take a -- a -- a week off from school and go sit in the classroom to see --
L:  See --
R:  -- what really goes on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with the l- with the teachers.  I mean, she said that, um -- my sister was explaining to me that some of the things that, um, she -- you know, she goes o- -- she sits down with my -- my nephew, every night, with his homework.  And she said, "Some of the stuff just don't make no sense.  It makes a child confusing".  And if you don't do certain things, if you don't return a -- you know, if there's a hard -- see, when we used to have homework and if you didn't understand it, we all went togeth- -- you know, we all got together as a group in class and we went over it which we didn't understand.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Not that you was lazy, that you didn't do your homework, but there's something that you might have missed out in the day lessons.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  These teachers don't go over it.  They just g- [MN] give me the homework, grade it and they give it back to you with a mark on it, with a grade on it.  And that's not healthy for a child if he's lacking in a disability in a certain area.
L:  Right.  He's not getting any explanation.
R:  Right.  You know, and he -- he's in SCORF[?].  He -- they have this special program called SCORF.  He's in after school and he's still slow but my sister really be busting her butt with him at night, you know, and it -- it's -- I don't know.  I d- -- I don't think the school -- the school is as strict as it used to be when we were coming up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  I -- I agree.
R:  You know, we had [inaudible] in the school that if you did act up that's where you sat until your moms come and pick you up.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, if they really got out of hand, uh, you -- you -- you either go to jail or the cops come and get you and your moms pick you up at the -- at the precinct.  Uh, they -- it just -- I don't know, these kids are too big too. 
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean you're looking at kids in sixth grade as tall as -- prob- -- they're probably six footers. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Isn't that itself is intimidating for --
R:  And, right.
L:  -- a teacher maybe.
R:  And then you have the -- the girls -- the young girls.  They're not ladies like, you know -- like when we was coming up.  Their mouths are so foul.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, I hear there's a teacher trying to give a lesson and you hear someone say, "F. you.  I don't wanna do --".  You know, like, why?
L:  Mm.
R:  And that -- they -- they're, um -- and especially when you have, um [LIPSMACK] you know, I -- I feel sorry for the kids who are international children that come in and try to -- you know, they -- they understand English but when they really try, they pick up the bad things in English.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They don't pick up the r- the correct and proper way of speaking.  Uh, it's -- it's difficult.  The school system is really difficult.  It's -- I don't -- I don't agree w- how they raise.  I don't know what -- what we can do.  I'm not a parent but I'm -- I'm supportive of parents.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I do want to see more kids.  You know, more -- you know, doing things instead of just hanging out in the street in the summer time.  But then there's a lot of cutbacks too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, the cutbacks number one is where the kids to make their little money, [LIPSMACK] uh, part of the work study program.  That's cut back.  Where they have more -- you know, this -- I don't know.  It's just the system to me lost control.  The Board of Education is losing control  They -- they're hiring all these people.  They got all these -- these coun- +councilors or whatever they wanna put in.  And they're not really -- I don't think, you know -- I mean, I know they can't be supermen but they need to be -- somebody needs to be in the school system to really see what goes on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know what they call them but they need to be sitting in them classrooms.  And see why is this teacher's -- why is this teacher, um, students is not -- is not grading -- his grades are not right.  You know what I'm saying?  There should be a track down more of the teachers, on what kind of grades they're really giving these kids, and what these kids are really learning.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, get before the class, tell me what you learned today.
L:  Right.
R:  And then they should know.  You know, maybe it's discriminatory but then that -- that's how you separate the good that -- that want to learn and the ones that don't.
L:  Mm. There is, um -- I just saw in the news yesterday about Chicago and Philadelphia --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- have these programs going now where they have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- privatized some of these schools --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where a private company has bought out some of the schools and is running some of the schools.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they've had some great success and I think a big thing is they've had the money to put into them to give, uh, teacher training.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so they are constantly undergoing better training, more appropriate training too maybe.
R:  Right.
L:  And also addressing other areas, possibly the discipline area.  Maybe they're also able to have fewer kids in a class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if there's more money for more teachers, they can separate the kids more and that -- then each kid gets a lot more attention.
R:  True.
L:  So ... Um, it m- -- it probably does come down to money a lot of times.
R:  Yeah, but then [MN] where's the heart?  Where's the heart?  Where's the -- you know -- where's the -- well, we used to have the teachers when I was coming u- -- hello?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I h- heard a clicking.
L:  Oh, not --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- yet, no.
R:  There was teachers that we had that, um -- that would took the little -- little time extra and spend an extra hour with a special -- a -- a student who really wants it or a class that really want it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, today, three oclock, people be running out before the -- the bell goes ding for three so the teachers are somehow is losing, uh, a lot of the focus.  And you're right.  Maybe a lot of teachers need to be retrained.  I feel there's a lot of teachers probably need to be retested, you know, as a -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as going for an interview for a resume again.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, go ahead and -- and see where -- where they might be lacking because there's -- a lot of the teachers, I'm not saying that a hundred percent, but a lot of teachers have been laid as- uh, led astray too and they -- and for raping, they're molesting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, so where's -- where's their focus?
L:  Right.
R:  I mean you're not thinking about teaching, you're thinking about lusting.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's pretty scary.
R:  Yeah.  You know, and that's bad for the -- especially these young girls who are really trying to keep a s- a -- a good straight line focus and here it is, you're got this grown man talking to you.  You know, you'll lose -- the kids will lose the f- and then you will [inaudible] about teachers, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I don't know.  It's kinda wicked.  Right now, it's been kinda quiet here in New York but, of course, today is the last day of school anyway.
L:  Oh, wow.  They go long.
R:  Hmm?
L:  [MN] Um, the kids have been out for at least a week here.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I see, uh -- city school today.
