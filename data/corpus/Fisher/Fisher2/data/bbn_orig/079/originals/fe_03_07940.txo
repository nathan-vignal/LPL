R:  Hello, my name is Ellen.  What is your name?
L:  [MN]  [SIGH]  Ah, my name is Kirby.  [MN]
R:  Hi!  [SIGH]  Hi, Kirby.  [SIGH]
L:  You sound like a woman --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and your name's Allen -- A.L.L.E. --
R:  Ellen.  No, it's Ellen.
L:  Oh, I thought you said Allen, I'm sorry.  [SIGH]
R:  So, ... [LAUGH]
L:  I thought you said, "My name's Alan".
R:  Here I am in a +linguistic study and I'm --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- pronouncing things [LAUGH] wrong.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, the subject is, ah, public schools and, ah, do -- do we think there's something wrong with the public schools and if so what [SIGH] does -- do -- can we do about it?  I [SIGH] -- I've always --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- e- a- ah, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I've always kind of, ah, never really understood the problem.  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- w- was raised in a poor family --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] in, ah, -- in Nashville and I lived in the projects and I, a- a- a- ah, went to, [SIGH] um, a racially integrated school and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'm sure that as far as public schools went it didn't get a lot of money, [SIGH] a- ah, and I thought I had a very good education.  I -- I really frankly [SIGH] t- think that it's just a problem of, ah, parents [SIGH] n- n- not raising their children well, you know, like, you know, if a child misbehaves in school there's -- some of the parents do anything about it.  [SIGH]  If a par- -- if children make ... bad grades it doesn't seem the parents do much about it.  I don't [SIGH] understand it because I think you c- could get a very g- good education [SIGH] +without spending a lot of money.  You just have to study.
R:  How long ago did you ... attend public schools?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, when I was in [LIPSMACK] -- I'm forty eight so, you know, my p- prime time I go- -- guess going to school was from nineteen sixty [SIGH] -- well, nineteen sixty two to, like, nineteen seventy two.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, that's the same age I am too so it's been a while since I've been in public schools and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I t- think -- things have changed a lot.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And I don't have children in public schools so I don't really see it first hand.  [SIGH]  I just --
L:  I did -- oh, did you have any children?
R:  No.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  No.  [SIGH]
R:  Do you?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, no, no, I don't either but, ah, [SIGH] you know, to me -- t- to me going to public school was just that I, you know, -- I had home work and I had, ah, -- books and, ah, [SIGH] and, ah, I was -- if -- if I did my homework and -- and I studied I usually did well in school.  I just don't understand.  I -- I don't get it.  I, [SIGH] um, --
R:  Well, they have a lot more, um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] things to do in the schools now than we used to have.  I -- I went to a poor school too and [SIGH] we had one teacher for three grades.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And then when I went to high school the -- the teachers weren't that good.  It was a small -- a small community and not very wealthy.  [SIGH]  But now it seems like the same schools and the same communities have a lot of p- personnel and ... a lot of choices that I never had.
L:  Mm.  [SIGH]
R:  So, it's -- they are better as far as the facilities and the -- and the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- choices.  [SIGH]  But I -- I -- I agree with you.  I think a lot of it is because the ... [SIGH] children aren't made to study and they're not made -- disciplined at home.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I mean -- ah, obviously if you [SIGH] -- if you have a child that's, ah, you know, coming home with bad grades you know there's something wrong.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, and, um, [MN] -- a- and if it's just -- if it's anything short of a doctor telling you that your child is mentally retarded or something, then I would think that it's really the parents' responsibility --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] to make sure that the child studies and, ah, has a quiet space to work [SIGH] and study and all these other things.  So, I just, ah, [SIGH] I, ah, I -- I just -- to me the -- that -- that you have more of an opportunity is less an excuse.  [SIGH]  I mean, [SIGH] if I had a c- computer I -- I could have done my homework I'm sure a lot faster.  I could have done research a lot faster, you know, I --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, we went to school wh- where we had to do our research going to the library catalogue and --
R:  Oh, yeah that's true.
L:  -- and, you know, there's a lot of things [SIGH] I -- I just see -- when I see students going to a school that's no more than twenty years old and the school is trashed and the [SIGH] -- and there's a lot of absenteeism I can't see how you could blame the government for that.  [SIGH]  Ah, I just -- I -- I -- ah, -- I don't think it takes that much money really to -- to educate somebody in -- in public school.  I mean you -- [SIGH] to me you have a -- to me you need a desk [SIGH] and you need a place with a -- a roof over your head [SIGH] and, ah, you need books --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you need a chalkboard, and you need a pencil and pen and pieces o- of paper.  [SIGH]  And -- and to me that's just what you need.  I don't really understand it.  I mean [SIGH] I went to a school so poor that -- that -- that -- [SIGH] we only could h- have, like, biology class when we could use the lab once a week [SIGH] when all the other schools around me, I mean, could use -- would have, a -- a biology lab they could use every day.  [SIGH]  But I still made very good grades in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- school.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I have a friend who was --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- v- voted teacher of the year -- I'm in Maine [SIGH] and he was voted teacher of the year in Maine one year --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and he's since retired and he said -- he couldn't take the school system any more.  He said they [SIGH] -- they're dumbing down everything.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's right, [MN] yeah.  Ah, one thing I would agree about i- is maybe I -- I would think it's only in some states, that there's so many --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- illegal children -- ah, illegal immigrants with their children c- coming here [SIGH] and they don't know English.  And, you know, if you bring a child into the United States and the child doesn't know English, [SIGH] and you're not making the +child -- child study English at ho- home, in fact, you're -- you're only speaking, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- your -- their native tongue at home [SIGH] how can you expect --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your child to do good in public school.  [SIGH]  Obviously, i- ah, to me if you're an +illegal -- illegal immigrant the least you could do for your child is make sure they watch [SIGH] T- -- American TV and learn English and only -- and, you know, a- and learn English at home.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I -- I -- I would never take a child to Russia [SIGH] and, ah, if I was poor and, ah, speak English around my child.  I -- I would make 'em [SIGH] go out and learn as much Russian as possible, even if I couldn't speak Russian myself, you know.  I just -- [SIGH] to me it's just really the parents.  It really is the parents.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I lived -- I lived in [NOISE] Connecticut for a while and they were --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- having bilingual classes there --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- so that they'd teach the kids in their own ... language [SIGH] and --
L:  I think that's w- wrong.
R:  -- and they're hoping eventually the kids will pick up enough --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- of the ... English --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to ... attend regular classes but they --
L:  Yeah, a- all language institutes, whether it's Berlitz or, you know, or t- the Institute Francais or [SIGH] the Goethe Institute t- that sp- -- that teaches German all over the w- world, you know, [SIGH] and the Institute Francais --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- all professional l- language schools -- all language, ah, schools, ah, [SIGH] subsidized by the state, and the French government does +subsidize -- subsidize the Institute Francais to sp- -- to t- teach people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to speak French all over the world [SIGH] and the Goethe Institute, ah, subsidizes -- [SIGH] the government pay for that almost totally to teach people to speak German all over the world.  [SIGH]  And Berlitz and others -- p- places they'll tell you -- they'll all tell you that the best way to learn language is immersion.  [NOISE]  Just literally just dump you around, ah, people that speak that language and you can't go back to your language, [SIGH] you know -- you know, know to --
R:  But here in Maine we don't have the language problem --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but we've still got, like, when he was --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] when my friend was teaching [SIGH] he said that --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- if he gave low grades to the kids then they ex- -- they think that the teacher is ... at fault [SIGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] and so the teacher's forced to give ... g- good grades to the kids even if they do poorly.
L:  [MN]  Well, that's -- that's the other problem with the state.  I think it's not [SIGH] -- I mean -- I mean that's a problem of, ah, their school board and his principal not backing him up.  Now I guess that's different but [SIGH] --
R:  But he said --
L:  -- yeah.
R:  -- that schools all over the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- United States are being dumbed down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He calls it dumbed down.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, you know, the question was what do we do about it?  Ah, to me I don't -- to me the only thing I can -- in my firm opinion is you don't throw more money at it.  [SIGH]  To me I just think i- i- it -- think is, ah, [SIGH] -- is just, ah, just, t- t- t- the government and -- and the school boards should be big -- more hard [SIGH] and firm about teaching the basics first before you let a child go on to the next grade.  [SIGH]  I -- I think that one of the problems is t- that -- I think you put t- the nail on the head that -- that st- students are -- are expected to dumb down -- just not high expectations of them.  [SIGH]  And you should never let a child go from the second grade to the third grade [SIGH] and on and on and on until that child [SIGH] knows, ah -- ah, the curriculum that they were supposed to know for the second grade.  There are so many people that are passed up to the next grade [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who has -- who haven't, ah, -- ah, learned what they should in -- in the grade they're at so [SIGH] I think t- that should be r- radically enforced.  [SIGH]  I think teachers should be fired, [SIGH] a -- ah -- ah -- ah, from their jobs if they graduate students who are -- who a- are not competent in that grade before they go to the next grade.  I think tho- those teachers should be fired or disciplined.  [SIGH]  And I think, ah, that parents, [SIGH] ah, who [LIPSMACK] do not give, ah, an atmosphere where their children c- could come, ah, home and study [SIGH] I think that they should lose parental r- rights to some degree.  I really, you know, y- I -- I -- if I had my way you'd be -- you would have to go to school and get a licence to be a parent, I really would.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, well, I don't agree with that.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  But I --
L:  -- would.
R:  Well these --
L:  You know, being a parent is a real, real serious responsibility --
R:  Oh, it is.
L:  -- and if you [SIGH] -- if you're not a good enough parent to have a -- [SIGH] a place for your child to come home and do their homework, I mean, wh- wh- -- you know, w- why well you -- you know this is terrible.  There's so many pe- people now having kids that -- that shouldn't have kids is what I'm saying.
R:  Y- yeah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I -- I don't like them taking kids ... away from their parents --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- either.
L:  Well, unfortunately [LIPSMACK] there's parents that should not be parents that's -- [SIGH] you know.  [SIGH]
R:  No.
L:  U- um, they -- maybe shouldn't -- they -- they're given visiting rights or whatever, but, ah, God, you know, if they're really -- if they're really h- harming -- if they're harming their children more than helping them, [SIGH] Jesus, take them away.  I mean and there are so many situations where [SIGH] their -- the parents harm their children more than if you actually -- ah, h- h- had them go to another place.  [SIGH]
R:  Maybe they should have classes in the schools for parents?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah, absolutely they should have classes in the school for parents.  [SIGH]  But I mean I really think that -- I really think t- that -- think, you know, if I had my way [SIGH] I would say, "You cannot have a child until you are, ah -- ah, have some kind of curriculum education [SIGH] ... f- first" and -- and that you would have to -- you
