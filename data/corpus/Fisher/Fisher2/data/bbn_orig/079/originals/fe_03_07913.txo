R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  H- hi, I'm Cherie.
L:  I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi Michelle.
L:  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's the first time I've ever done this.
R:  [LAUGH] Me, too.
L:  Oh, okay, ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I guess we're supposed to talk about a million dollars --
R:  I -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I -- I don't know -- I probably would, but, I don't -- I'm not really sure.
L:  [LAUGH] I'd hate to say it, but, I probably would, too.
R:  I know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [MN] is -- is that embarrassing, or what?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, I have some good friends, but, a million dollars could take care of a lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a discussion group survey.  I know, exactly, I mean -- do you -- I -- I -- I think about the best friends I had years ago, that I don't talk to any more, so, I guess it -- if I wouldn't have taken the million dollars I would have been on a million dollars, but ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, m- most people don't have that many close friends that they hold onto for that long, so ...
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  And, I have kids, and they'd probably [SIGH] benefit from the million dollars more than my friend.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could think of a lot I could do with a million dollars, I mean, it's like, once you have kids and a family --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you don't have friends any more --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I mean, you do, but not --
L:  They're scheduled in.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  Well, mine are anyway.
R:  Huh?  Yeah, exactly, mine, too.  [NOISE]
L:  So ... [SIGH] oh, boy, okay --
R:  So ... 
L:  -- um, this is -- 
R:  I know this is hard -- how do you talk t- -- for ten minutes about that?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] [MN] Talk about the morality of you'd rather have the money than your friends.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Ah, you know, ah -- I don't know -- I feel bad and all, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] My -- my husband just says, "With money you could buy friends".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, my husband totally agrees with that theory, too --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I didn't even need to ask him.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, um ... [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] So, did you sign up -- up for this on the computer?
R:  Yeah, I did.  Did you?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... [SIGH] um ...
R:  Anyways, okay --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so, um, I don't know what else to talk about.
L:  I don't either, this is a lot weirder than I thought it would be.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  So, where are you located at?
L:  I'm in Oklahoma.
R:  Oh, and I'm in California.
L:  You're in California, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, gosh, you're so c- -- calling late then.
L:  Um, it's eleven fifteen here.
R:  Oh, that's not too bad -- not too, too bad.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] that they would still do it that late, but ...
R:  Yeah, it is kind of -- but, I guess -- I guess they're trying for a broad spectrum of ...
L:  Yeah, maybe some people ...
R:  -- people.  So, we now know that people in Oklahoma and California would -- would both take the million dollars, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's not -- it's not --
L:  We're all --
R:  -- just those California people that want money.
L:  We all are immoral.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And hopefully none of our friends ever find out.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly, yeah -- "Oh, I didn't say that".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They'd probably say the same thing, though, I mean --
R:  Oh, I know -- I know.
L:  -- and I wouldn't fault them either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  I could be their, you know, stranger friend or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, well, kind of the thing, too, is how would they ever know -- the stipulation is you don't, but, I mean [SIGH] -- who's -- I mean, is somebody gonna actually keep that much track of you?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's very true.
R:  I mean, I know one of my best friends, I met online and -- [MN] I mean, we actually ended up -- we had grown up in the same area --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything, and she, um, lives in Las Vegas, which is not really far from where I'm at, 'cause I'm in eastern southern California, I guess you would call it, [MN] and, um, I don't -- I -- ninety nine percent of the time we talk online rather than on the telephone.
L:  It's a lot cheaper.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly, I mean it's cheaper to drive there gas wise, than it is to -- to actually talk on the phone.
L:  Really?  It's that close?
R:  Well, it's about three and a half hours --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but, I mean, oh, gosh, I [MN] -- I had -- we had -- I had, like, a two hundred dollar phone bill one month --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- and it was, like, "Okay --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- this is gonna stop --"
L:  Yeah, I can't --
R:  "-- we have to talk -- we have to get our headsets and talk on the pho- -- on the computer".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] I just use that Yahoo messenger and you can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, use a microphone and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's free that way, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  So --
L:  I'm gonna go --
R:  -- I know, I was lazy 'cause the phone's easier, especially when you're walking around the house --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- checking kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  Technology. [SIGH] 
R:  I know -- scary thing.
L:  Yes.  [SIGH] [MN] Let me see, I know -- I have a friend -- she lives a coupla blocks away, but, my best -- I was born in Colorado, so, most [inaudible] -- when we moved down here most of my friends were left there, but ... [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's a long ways.
L:  [SIGH] Um, it's only about six hundred miles from here, now, but, still ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but, that still seems far, 'cause we moved, um, from the coast in California -- southern California, to where we're at now, which is high desert [MN] -- it -- well, like I said, it's pretty close to Las Vegas, um, it's -- and it's kind of weird -- it's like being totally disconnected.
L:  Yeah, well, there -- there is a big difference in Oklahoma and Colorado, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [MN] Without the distance even.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's exactly with this too, and we're only -- we only moved a hundred and fifty miles about, maybe, and, it's just a drastic difference.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  Wow.
R:  So ...
L:  Jeeze, I can't imagine living that close to Las Vegas -- that must be exciting.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] The only -- the only time I go is if I go and visit her, and then when we go, I have once -- we went into a grocery store to pick up some groceries on the way to her house, and I played a coupla slot machines [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I drove --
R:  -- and then walked out and I -- I have never even been in a casino there, when I've gone to visit her.
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Even when I was younger I went, but ...
L:  I've never been -- we're gonna go in March, so, that --
R:  Oh, have fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You'll have --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you'll have fun when you do that, but, I mean, when I -- when I was going I had the kids with me usually -- my husband most of the time didn't go -- 'cause I would go during the week, and it would be hot -- oh, hot, hot, hot.
L:  Yeah, it's pretty warm here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so, we just stayed in the house -- so, we would take the kids to the casinos that had the rides and the -- you know, the amusement park type of stuff.
L:  Yes. [SIGH] We're gonna take ours, but, we have -- my husband's family's going, and, so, we're gonna have a permanent babysitter, kind of, [several inaudible words] so, that'll be neat.
R:  [SIGH] Well, I -- [MN] and I didn't know this 'til [MN] a coupla years ago when I started going out there -- they, um -- in the casinos, I mean, I wouldn't -- 'cause I have a six year old, and a nine year old, and I still probably wouldn't do it with my six year old, unless my friend's thirteen year old was with them -- but, um, you can take 'em in and they armband 'em and they just absolutely cannot get out without you.
L:  Oh, is there a --
R:  I mean, I --
L:  -- daycare, or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, it's just like an amusement park, I mean, I've let my son go with her son, but, I haven't let my daughter go.  [SIGH] 
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, just because I think that the boys might get distracted and kind of --
L:  Abandon ... [LAUGH]
R:  -- forget about her, and not so much that she could get out, because she couldn't get out of there, but, she would just get scared.
L:  Yeah.  [MN] I have a eight year old and a three year old, so -- eight year old might like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, my daughter would like it, she's very weird for a girl, but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, my daughter would love it, too, I'm just -- I would just --
L:  I couldn't treat her -- I -- I don't know -- I wouldn't trust --
R:  Yeah, I -- I do- -- I, yeah, and then you know ...
L:  She's a handful.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't know -- ev- -- you know, the strangest people end up in those places, so ...
L:  [MN] Yeah, some [SIGH] -- maybe [MN] my son could go there, and my daughter could stay with the babysi- -- that would probably make it easier all the way around, so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  We'll see -- who knows?  [LAUGH]
R:  But, there's a lot of -- a lot of fun stuff to do there, 'cause I hadn't been there in, like, eight years, and it's just so -- there's so much -- it's like, you just -- you get to the strip, and it's like, "Okay, where do I go now?" -- there's so much to do.
L:  [MN] It -- I seen it on TV, you know, in books and things -- I never been there -- I drove through there when I was, you know, a lot younger, but, we didn't stay or nothing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we went to Arkansas.  [LAUGH] Went the long way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, that was it.  I didn't get to go in anyplace or anything -- I saw the dam and that was it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] 
R:  Well, you'll have fun there.
L:  Well, that's -- I hope so!  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, you will -- it's -- it's a lot of fun, and you're going at a good time of year.
L:  Yeah, I didn't want to go when it was too hot, and --
R:  Oh, no, 'cause -- oh, th- there was -- [MN] I mean, one time we went, and, um, I had parked my car in her driveway, and the kids had plastic, and, I mean, thick plastic like, little bug catcher house things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they d- -- that they were gonna do there, and they literally melted flat in the backseat.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah, it's that -- I mean, it gets to like, a hundred and fifteen -- it's just hot -- [MN] fortunately --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's pretty dry, but, it can get a little humid there because of the lake.  [MN] 
L:  See, we're real humid here, and we're like a hundred and four, hundred and five, you know, usually in the summer, but ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Here -- where we're at right now, we have, like, hardly any humidity, but, where we lived before on the coast it was really humid, and now, like, I -- sometimes I go down there, like, to visit my dad or friends and it -- I just -- I can't believe that I ever lived in that humidity.
L:  [SIGH] It's kinda --
R:  It --
L:  -- yeah, when we go to, you know, visit family back in Colorado, and we come down here, it -- the air's real hard -- it's like, heavier -- it's hard to breathe for a while.
R:  Yeah, it's har- -- it's hard to breathe.
L:  It's thicker [inaudible] [LAUGH] -- but, when you're here, after a while you don't notice it.
R:  Yeah, oh, yeah.  [SIGH] W- --
L:  Except for when it's real hot.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  We went a co- -- ah, two years ago on a six week vacation, we went to Wyoming and Idaho, and then Nebraska, and South Dakota, and we ended up at -- going to visit my grandparents in Iowa for fourth of July, and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the car -- 'cause we had the air cus-  cus- air conditioning going, and we were driving all night, and, then we got at her -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to her house at six thirty in the morning, and I got out of the car and I thought I was going to pass out, I mean, the m- ...
