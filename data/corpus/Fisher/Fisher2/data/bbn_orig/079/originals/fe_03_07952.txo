L:  Hello, my name is Mary.
R:  Hi, my name is Kim.  [PAUSE] So, our topic is, um, about the schools.
L:  Yeah, public schools.  
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, do you have any kids in public schools?  Uh ...
R:  Yes, I do. I have three of 'em.
L:  Okay, um, well, I have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- two teenagers.  One's in a like a junior high middle school and one's in a senior high and other --
R:  I have -- I have, um, three o- -- I have in four- will be fourth, one in third and one in second.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I don't know what to talk about.  Um, how do y- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I guess, how do you feel like about like prayer in the schools [LAUGH] and stuff like that?  I don't know.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, some of the stuff is all right in schools.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I just don't like how they treat --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- the handicapped children because I have two of them's handicap.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  And I just don't like it[?] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they think the kids can't do all the work.
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  And they --
L:  Well, I taught at a school once.  I was like a, um, secretary and I don't know, there -- it was a middle school and -- and -- and as far as, you know, with the handicapped kids, they seemed to, you know, like th- -- a lot of focus were mostly on like the children that couldn't get around a lot.  It was like they didn't pay a lot of attention to the ones that were handicapped but were able to like walk on their own and stuff, you know.  It was more or so like they would just s- sit there, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I guess, you know, in a way, it is right what you're saying.  Because it's like, you know, they weren't trying to -- you know it's almost like they treated them like they were at daycare.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, instead of at school so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can kinda agree on that.  [SIGH] [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I know, because my oldest is ten and she h- -- she has [inaudible] disability and she has speech.  And every time she talks s-, one of the schoolteachers make fun of her because she can't talk --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- right.
L:  So, did you -- you ever brought that issue up with, you know, someone at school?  The principal or something?
R:  Oh, yes.  I've [inaudible] calling her about every other day.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I notice sometimes when you complain a lot, you know, a p- -- as a parent, they -- they'll -- they'll take it out on the kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause then when my son was in like ju- -- elementary school, I had a problem with the teacher and she -- you know, whenever I complained he would come home, you know, things weren't right and I complained, she kinda like would take it out on him.  
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH] And to me, that wasn't right.  Um, y- is the t- teacher younger or older teacher?
R:  She, um, younger.
L:  Yeah, I that's a little problem too now.  [MN] Back when we were -- well, when I was in school, I'm --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- thirty three.  The -- a lot of the teachers were older ladies like forties or fifties.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think they were really there 'cause they wanted to teach and I think now a lot of the teachers are really young and they really -- their heart is really not in it.  You know [LAUGH] it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- more like, "This is just a job" or pay check.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, you know, they really don't have a lot of -- I think, empathy for the kids.  They're trying to help 'em learn.  You know, most of those[?] are just, "Well, let me get my six hours in and I can go home" you know.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [MN] I agree.  Because I'm thirty two and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] I had a lot of older teachers who may take their time out and --
L:  Yeah, and they wanted to help you learn, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and now is like i- i- if the -- if the child is like, you know, a little bit i- -- you know, if something's behaviorally wrong -- I have one k- child that's ADD.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, the first thing they wanna do is want you to be -- put 'em on medicines, you know, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- sometimes the kids aren't ADD, it's just normal kid behavior.
R:  [MN]
L:  But they want 'em like zombies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to where they don't have to do anything, you know?
R:  Oh, I agree.
L:  [MN] Yeah, and -- and as far as the higher ups, you know, it's like the way it's built -- the way the system is with the schools, you know, if you complain to the teachers and you take it to the principal it's like -- it's like you don't get anywhere.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, it's like you're just spinning your wheels.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  You know?  And I get angry because there's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- always, you know, a pay raise, a pay raise, a pay raise and -- and I think, you know, basically y- you know, why give 'em raises when you're not sure that your kids are being probably taught.
R:  Oh, I --
L:  'Cause --
R:  -- know.
L:  -- I live in Louisiana, and we have the lowest grades of all the s- you know, in the -- in the whole entire US as far as the, um, CRT tests and these, um, [MN] these -- uh, forgot what the name of that -- that has to give the kids to get out.  The LEAP tests and all that, we have the lowest scores.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, you know, and I'm like -- and they always wanna give the teachers a raise and I'm like, "Well, somethings not right".  You know, why give 'em a raise if your kids aren't learning more, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  It's just like a big issue but I don't see where -- if there's anything we can do as parents.  You know, they said, you know, "If you can't afford to send your kids to, you know, a private school, you have to ..." you know, and I guess a lot of teachers feel like that.  They feel, well, they gotta, you know, "Regardless if they take their kid from you or not, I'm still gonna be here 'cause they need me".
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, they don't care.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, how the -- how the kids are treated.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and I'm in [inaudible] -- I'm in New York state.  [several inaudible words].
L:  Mhm.
R:  The school district here is, you know?  They keep fighting and it's like, "Well, we want a raise and we wanna do this --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and that".  What -- how can you?
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know?
L:  -- you don't see no improvement --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in what --
R:  No.
L:  -- your kids are being taught or nothing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  And then I think more so when I was -- when I went to school, you know, a lot of -- we -- we said the pledge of allegiance, we said a prayer --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and -- and it was more, um -- the teachers were allowed more discipline.  You know, they -- we -- they put us on our knees or we had to go outside and now, you know, here we have a lot of law suits where parents are suing the schools because the kid was put outside on their knees.  You know, and stuff like that.
R:  Yep.
L:  And I think that makes the kids to where they figure, you know, they can go to school and do whatever they want.  The k- teachers can't tell 'em nothing.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, you know, and there's no way you're gonna be able to teach a kid if they don't respect you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they figure, "You can't tell be nothing on what to do because my mama's going do this ahead" you know, so ...  And I think that's -- that's basically what it is.  It's just being changed a lot.  You know, the teachers don't have any more control and then, uh, to me, in my heart, I know if I was a teacher and I had a kid that was always very, very -- you know, with a parent always coming to school and arguing about this and that, I would have some animosity, so I know they do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know they do.  And I think that interferes with a lot with what's going on.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know?  And then my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- second daughter, Lindsay, she has a best friend who -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, her -- she's colored and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- h- er, she's come home, she's, "Mommy, how come my best friend always get abuse?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I said, "Well, you speak up for her".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she does.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I go to even tell the school -- schoolteacher and I said, "That's not right being mean to a --".  Uh, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're human beings just like everybody else.
L:  Well, the school there -- is -- well, is the majority white where your kids go or ...
R:  Um, it's half white in, um, color and Puerto Rican.  They're all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mixtures.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I always taught my children, "Woof[?]. It doesn't matter if they're white --" 
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- black, purple, green or polka dots --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- their human beings just like us.  They bleed like us."
L:   Mhm.
R:  "You don't -- they have feeling just like us.  You don't do that to them".
L:  And -- and --
R:  And my daughters --
L:  -- here is different.  Because I -- in Louisiana is real -- it -- I'm aint gonna -- I'm not gonna say it's real racist --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- 'cause I'm African American so I mean I've dealt with s- you know, sometimes but as far as the schools here -- the kids -- the majority of the schools are -- the public schools are mixed so the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kids here they don't deal with a lot of racism in the s- in the public schools here.
R:  [MN] 
L:  There's more so private schools because a lot of the people here that are racist, what they do -- they won't send their kids to public school.  They'll put 'em --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in private school or they'll home school 'em.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, you know, it's rare that you have a racism issue in the public schools here because they're so mixed.  You know, it's so much of a mixture.  And then maybe it does go on and I just don't know about it.  But my kids, you know, they've -- they've never really said.  You know, they may come home and say, "Mom, well, one of my teachers act funny with me".  They p- you know, the kids'll say stuff like that but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I don't know.  You know, I really -- I -- I can't see where [SIGH] it was -- it's been an extreme issue 'cause to me if it was bad enough, it would -- maybe it would be in the paper.  Somebody would've had to sa something.  You know, there would have been --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- an incident to where something would've been brought up about it so I -- I -- I don't know.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, that's one thing I'm not.  I mean, I've alwa- -- I grew up and, you know, they're human being.  You're -- you're a human --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- being just like us.
L:  [LIPSMACK] We still having an issue with, um -- I think it's, um, desegregating the schools.  You see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the schools here, the way it is, the teachers can teach where they want.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, a lot of the teachers choose to go to a school where there's not as -- you know, like maybe you may see a school, like in the ghetto, where there's a lot of black kids, hard to control.  The teachers that choose to go to a school where there's [MN] more -- better students and the higher, like maybe, you know, upper class neighborhood to teach.  So, what they're doing here, they're trying to make it to where the teachers don't have a choice.  They have to -- they're like desegregated.  Put the teachers -- 'cause what they're finding is that a lot of the teachers that are teaching in the lower class neighborhoods --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're teachers that has been suspended from other places or have bad records or bad raps and they're not teaching the kids.
R:  [MN]
L:  And you have all the good teachers that wanna be teachers that wanna be teachers and teaching, they're teaching over here 'cause they don't wanna deal with the, you know -- the bad kids.  Oh, well, you know, the kids in a lower class neighborhood.
R:  Right.
L:  So, maybe that would be considered as a form of racism.  I don't know but -- we have -- that's an issue now and they're talking about it a lot on TV so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, and I know they've moved a few teachers from different schools.
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, they kinda like branch 'em out and I don't think that's right either because if I was a teacher, I wouldn't want someone telling me where I can work.
R:  Uh, no.
L:  You know, but still and all, I guess they figure it's for the best of the kids so, I don't know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's wrong.
L:  Yeah.  So, you live in New York, you said.
R:  Yep.
L:  And so they probably have like maybe sixty, seventy kids per classroom [LAUGH] there, huh?
R:  No, they have -- actually have twenty three kids in ea- --
L:  Twenty three, wow.
R:  Twenty three and they have three teachers.
L:  Oh, wow, per -- 
R:  Yeah.
R:  -- in each twenty three class?
R:  Yep.
L:  Wow, here we have like thirty seven students and one teacher.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, I would've thought being in New York, more people --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- less teachers, you know, but it's different.  Maybe that's the problem.  You see, the kids have more and I think what --
