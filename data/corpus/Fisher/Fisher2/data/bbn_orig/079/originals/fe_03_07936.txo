R:  [NOISE]
L:  H- hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Isabella.
L:  This is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Pat.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you.
R:  I'm fine.
L:  The topic --
R:  So, [NOISE] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the +topic is t- public schools so ...  Do you think there's something wrong with them?
L:  With the -- with the school system?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  What do you think's wrong?  [NOISE]
L:  For one thing, uh, uh, depending on where you live, there aren't enough qualified teachers.  And there aren't enough qualified --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teachers 'cause there isn't enough money for them.
R:  [LIPSMACK] True.  Where do you live?  [NOISE]
L:  North Dakota.
R:  [NOISE] Okay, yes, I live in California.  [NOISE] 
L:  So --
R:  And I am a teacher.
L:  You are a teacher?
R:  Yes.
L:  And it --
R:  Um --
L:  Is California in as bad a shape for teachers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as North Dakota?
R:  No.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN] North --
R:  No.
L:  -- Dakota waits[?] I think.  We're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- close to the last --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the -- in the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fifty states --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for paying teachers. 
R:  [NOISE] Yes, yeah.
L:  I- I think we're forty eighth out of fiftieth or something like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I know that in many states the pay's very low.  Now [NOISE] the pay is low [NOISE] at my district [NOISE] for us [NOISE] but I've been with them a long time and I'm bilingual [NOISE] so they were [NOISE] paying more.  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] I tell you what the problem is around [NOISE] here.  They've really taken big [NOISE] steps to remedy it.  They have a lot of [NOISE] curriculum.  [NOISE] Very regimented curriculum and I don't like that.  It's uncreative.  They're cutting out [NOISE] music --
L:  Oh, I -- I see.
R:  And [NOISE] -- and yeah, they're cutting out a lot of stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  For the teachers -- there's all these teacher's manual you teach.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] And my districts, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] say --
L:  That's a big pro- --
R:  Um ... [NOISE]
L:  That is a big problem, isn't it?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's uncreative.  It's very boring to teach but I'm telling you, it's working.  Our test [inaudible] have gone up.  The school that I teach.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It -- the children are type of inner city, bilingual.  I'm a bi -- was a bilingual teacher and now [NOISE] doing it in English.  [NOISE] Their test scores have come -- gone up and the kids leave kindergarten knowing their letters, um, which is amazing.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Because they're all English language learners, a lot of 'em so ... [NOISE]
L:  Oh, h- uh, see we were, um -- I live -- I live in a low income area and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --think we -- I think they have s- uh -- have seven different languages up at our school.
R:  [NOISE] Right, right [NOISE] right.
L:  [MN] That we h- --
R:  Well, we, mm --
L:  We have, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, what am I trying to -- we have Chinese out here, we have Japanese, we have, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I can't even th- Thai.  Some from Thailand, you know, they all speak --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- foreign -- oh, er, to me, foreign --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- languages.  It's not to them.  And we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have teachers out here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that are teaching these kids.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And I -- and I think I heard that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there were seven languages taught out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that's good.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I also -- that I think English --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they're going to live here, English should be number one.
R:  Right.  Well, we -- we switched in here in the Los Angeles area that, uh, I love teaching in Spanish.  I speak Spanish.
L:  You speak Spanish --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- okay?
R:  Fluent, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I love teaching in Spanish but they cut that out and I was very sad about that [NOISE] but at the same time I see the necessity for teaching English, [NOISE] you know.  
L:  And --
R:  And -- and --
L:  -- I see the necessity very much of speaking English [MN] but also they have to [MN] be able to communicate with the kids so you have to get somebody in there to understand them.
R:  [NOISE] And that is -- that used to be a problem here too, to get teachers to speak the kids' languages [NOISE] or are trained, uh -- I, myself, have trained [NOISE] teachers in teaching these English language learners and [NOISE] even some of the veteran teachers, they didn't have the right methods and -- 'cause you have to speak a little slower and you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have to use a lot of [NOISE] pictures and you have to be trained for that but if the teacher's pay is not good then who's attracted to the teaching profession?
L:  That's right.  Like I said I'm [MN] pretty sure North Dakota is forty eighth out of fiftieth in paying --
R:  Right.
L:  -- teachers.
R:  Right, right.  [NOISE]
L:  And that's bad.
R:  It's low [MN] --
L:  That -- that's bad.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know what, it's not [NOISE] that bad here but still it's lower than a lot of the other professions.
L:  Yes, I agree.
R:  So it's [NOISE] -- and so it doesn't attract, [NOISE] you know -- it does -- and plus I used to buy so much stuff from my own money.
L:  I believe that.  That's what I hear.  I have a friend who is a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- teacher in a small school, maybe twenty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- miles from here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she takes so much stuff from her home.
R:  Yes.
L:  And has to buy it out of her money and at --
R:  Right.
L:  -- PTA we heard the same thing.
R:  [NOISE] And we only get paid for six [NOISE] hours but we have to prepare a lot.  I work -- you know, I used to work like lots and lots of hours until I figured out [NOISE] -- I teach kindergarten and th- that is the reason why I teach that because I can manage to take home +all[?] the work load and I love the little kids to be their first teacher but actually I'm leaving teaching myself because I adopted two kids and I'm gonna home school them.
L:  Oh --
R:  And that's really what's wrong with public education in my opinion.  It's not a godly upbringing, you know?  [NOISE]
L:  Did you like teaching?
R:  Oh, I loved it.  
L:  Did you?
R:  I loved it.  I still -- you know, I chose, um --
L:  You still must love it?
R:  I love it but I tell you what.  Once I got my own kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm gonna home school them.  I wanna teach them about God and, you know, you can't do that in public school.
L:  N- are you teaching --
R:  Not --
L:  Are you gonna teach them at home?  Home school them?
R:  Yes.  [NOISE]
L:  Yes.  'Cause the lady --
R:  Yes, I am.  [NOISE]
L:  -- across the street home schooled.  I just happen to know that and her kids --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are fine.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  There's nothing wrong --
R:  I'm going --
L:  There's nothing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wrong with that if you -- if you have the qualifications.
R:  Yeah, and I do so, you know, it's -- and I wanna teach 'em about God.  You can't really do that in public school.  
L:  No, you can't.
R:  They --
L:  No, you can't.  Well, you could --
R:  They throw [NOISE] --
L:  We could when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was in school
R:  Yeah, they throw so much unimportant stuff [NOISE] but they have in -- in California, they have given us [MN] funds reasonably.  We're getting computers and everything but, uh, we waited all this time.  Having a very large school system and -- and having outmoded stuff but it kind of bores the teachers to [inaudible] all these manuals.  It's very uncreative.  I tell you, it's not -- not as much fun as it used to be.
L:  I believe --
R:  But --
L:  -- that.
R:  Because the k- you know -- there's not enough art in those curriculums, not enough science.  [NOISE] There's a lot of push for language, arts and math and that's [NOISE] basically it.  That's all you have [inaudible] --
L:  That's basically it, okay.
R:  Yeah, and that's really [NOISE] kind of --
L:  So --
R:  -- sad.
L:  So, what do you think can be done about this.  Anything?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think, yeah, we need to, you know -- uh, we need to, uh, a- a- as parents we can fund raise.  [NOISE] We can try to help at the school district.  We can go and help in the classroom.  We can volunteer.  We can get [MN] --
L:  I've volunteered.
R:  -- programs going.  We can bring stuff.  We can [NOISE] lobby for bills we don't think are good for the kids.  You know?  Um ...
L:  Well, even when -- when our son was out of school.  We only had one son and when he --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was out of school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my -- my husband still called at P- -- at the, uh, you know, the -- oh, what do I want, um, to say -- the, um ...?
R:  PTA.  [NOISE]
L:  PT -- when they had the carnival -- school carnival.
R:  Yes.
L:  He still called --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- called bingo for about three, [MN] four years after our son was out of that school because he --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- enjoyed it.  And the kids liked having him come up there and call.
R:  Yes, yes.
L: You know, it -- and they made a lot of money up there.  Not, you know -- not tons and tons of money but for the area they made a lot of money at the school PTA's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at the carnival.
R:  Right, right.
L:  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we always volunteered there.
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, materials are very import- -- uh, I tell you something.  In the classroom, we used to have this old fashioned [inaudible] machine and they were blue and the fingers were blue.  The kids barely could read it.  That was horrible.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, you have to have the right stuff for the kids.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Theres a lot of -- teaching stuff is very expensive but you have to have c- copies.  Teachers should have enough copies to be made.  The mater- -- the rooms should be, uh, staffed with [MN] -- the stuff.  There should be after school programs.  [NOISE] We've done all that stuff and I tell you it's [NOISE] made a big difference.
L:  When you -- when you taught did you put in a -- a whole lot of time?  More so than like an eight hour job?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I only get paid for six hours.
L:  Oh, six hours?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  You only get paid for six hours.  At least at my district and you work eight.  [NOISE] 
L:  You worked eight.  And some --
R:   Yeah.
L:  -- teachers w- do more than that.
R:  Yeah.  You've only gotta work -- take work home.  That's why I'm -- 
L:  Oh, you only --
R:  -- I -- yeah.
L:  I didn't know you only got paid for six.
R:  Well, uh, do you figure it out?
L:  That's in Califor- -- 
R:  Yes, that's in [MN] --
L:  -- that's in California though, right?
R:  And my- -- in Los Angeles unified school district, you get paid six.  That's all.
L:  Oh, how.
R:  Ya.  And you don't get paid the summer, of course.  You know.  Just --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- learn to manage your money.
L:  Really?
R:  Ya.  You know.  [MN]
L:  And I -- I would imagine there were days you put way more than six hours in.
R:  Oh, always.  Always put -- and you know what.  A good thing is though they have reduced class size out here.  That really works.  [NOISE]
L:  Is that conferences?  Oh --
R:  No --
L:  What did you say?
R:  No.  Class size.  The kids, uh -- the ratio of kids to teacher in kindergarten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through third grade [NOISE] is --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- twenty.  [NOISE] That works.  [NOISE]
L:  That's good.
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE] I mean, I was part of a pilot program that are gonna test that and they found out it worked and it really worked.  [NOISE] Because the kids have more.  There's less kids in the class so the teacher has to m- more -- can give more attention to the students, you know?
L:  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That --
R:  And they need to -- yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So, it is a problem but it -- you know, if people got to- --
R:  Well, you don't have these things, you know, no.  In my state, [NOISE] they have really tried hard to change things.
L:  You did?
R:  I really say that.  Yes, I really can say that.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, [NOISE] in fact, California is probably the richer state than North Dakota so you know?  Finally they're channeling all the money more to the education which when I first started it wasn't the case.  [NOISE]
L:  Your --
R:  You know?
L:  -- first daughter is what?
R:  [NOISE] I said, er, "When I first started --" [NOISE] "-- teaching, they were --"
L:  Oh.
R:  "-- not channeling the money into, uh, education as much --" [NOISE] "-- as they're doing now".  [NOISE]
L:  No.
R:  They're --
L:  That's true.
R:  They -- [NOISE] they've really [NOISE] -- they have --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they have tried to change things.  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE]
