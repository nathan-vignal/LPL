L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Toni.
R:  Mimi.
L:  Hi.  Okay, now.  Yes, I love going to the movies.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.
L:  You too.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's expensive though.
L:  Yeah, it -- well, I always go in the afternoons.  I -- I just -- I would like to go at night, only it is too expensive.  It would be nice even if they had special nights, you know, that you didn't have to, you know, like, "Gee, this is a special night, you can pay cheaper", of course that never happens.  What's the last movie you saw?
R:  Oh, I think it was Finding Nemo.
L:  Oh, you saw that?  How did you like it?
R:  I didn't think it was that good.
L:  No.  I saw, um, let's see, the last one was, um, oh -- oh, ni-, um -- um, Matrix.
R:  Oh, I saw that one too.
L:  [inaudible] Did you saw that too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What did you think of it?
R:  Um, I didn't think it was as good as the first one.  [NOISE] 
L:  No.  Well, I think because they knew they were coming out with the -- the next one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I didn't like the way just to be co- -- to be continued it was just a little, you know, like if you didn't then -- it didn't have any kind of an ending, so, if you didn't really watch the whole thing, you didn't get anything out of it really, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, then and then I saw, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, Bruce, ah, what is it?  Almighty.  Was it Bruce?
R:  Yeah, I saw that one too.
L:  Yeah, that was funny.  The first time I finally saw him that he's funny for quite a while now.  He's been doing some wild stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, that was pretty -- that was okay.  I liked that.
R:  I saw, um, Daddy Daycare.  That was really funny.
L:  Yeah, I saw that.  That was pretty good.
R:  Mm.
L:  That -- that was okay.  But, you know, he did -- it was a very short movie, you know, I mean, it -- but, I think they -- he does that all the time because he knows he's gonna make a sequel --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, like he did with, ah, um, [LIPSMACK] what do you call it, Nutty Professor and, oh, that other one he made.  He -- he always seem to make, you know, Nutty Professor Two and, so, I don't think they really care, he doesn't at least, if the first one is that interesting, 'cause he always comes out with a sequel.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  What was the other one?  Um, Nutty Professor, and there was one other one he -- oh, ah, Doctor Dolittle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Because, ah, I didn't like the second one of that; the one with the bear.  Did you see that?  [PAUSE]  You there?
R:  Yeah.  Sorry.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's cutting out I think.
L:  Did you -- huh?
R:  It's cutting out.
L:  Oh.  Um, you have a cell phone.
R:  Ah, no, um, I have a cordless phone.
L:  Oh, cordless phone.  Ah, well, I -- I just -- I really tend to really, um, like the new movies.  They haven't made any, you know, really good ones, and now they're making them all the time.  I like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I want to go see that new one this week with all -- oh, did you see the one, ah, with all of the, um -- the, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, what do I call 'em?  They weren't mutants, yeah, the mutants, um, what was it called?  Ah, X Twenty -- X Two --
R:  The X Men?
L:  With all -- huh?
R:  X Men?
L:  X Men.  That's what it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wasn't that good?
R:  Yeah, that was really good.
L:  I liked that one better than the first one.
R:  Me too.
L:  That was so good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like it because they didn't make these kids, you know, look any different, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- only I think that a couple of them, like the guy with the purple.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the ones they did make were real distinctive and they were good.  But I -- I like the way that just the kids were just regular kids until they did something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think that's gonna -- I think that's gonna be a good movie, you know, I -- they'll probably come out with another one 'cause it's so good.  What else have I watched?  [SIGH] What have you watched?
R:  [NOISE] Have you seen that, um -- that new Charlie Angels movie yet?
L:  No, that's this week.  Did you go see it yet?
R:  We were going to go see it yesterday, but I had to work.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, well, I have to work this weekend, so I'll probably go see it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the middle of the week some time.  But, it's a big difference in price, the beginning of the week, you know, like it's, um, five dollars here.  What part of the country are you from?  Where are you from?
R:  I'm sorry, what did you say?
L:  Hello.  Huh?
R:  I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.
L:  Oh.  Oh, I just said, "What state are you in?"
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah, what state are you in?
R:  Oh, I'm in Illinois.
L:  Oh, Illinois.  Well, here it's, ah, five -- about five dollars during the day, and it's, ah, eight fifty at night.
R:  Mm.
L:  What's it there?
R:  Um, I think it's like six during the day and eleven at night maybe.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  That is high.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm in Florida, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's a little cheaper in Florida.  But I -- I am definitely going to go to see Charlie's A- --  I -- I think that they are really good.  I wasn't too crazy about it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  so after all the -- the, um, coming attractions, and it looked really -- and I like the stars, so ... yeah, I'm going to see that this coming week.
R:  Me too.
L:  Well, I can't think of anything else about the movies, 'cept the stars.  I like my favorite, which is Pretty Woman --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and Ghost.
R:  I like that one too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think my favorite one's Forrest Gump.
L:  Oh, you like Forrest Gump?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I've watched that twice.  Yeah, I -- I haven't seen it in a while, but I like that.  But my -- I think my favorite one is, ah, Sabrina --
R:  Is what?
L:  I like that.  Sabrina.  That's, you know, with, ah, the guy marries -- well, he's -- the girl, she's a chauffeur's daughter, and I think it's Harrison Ford is in that one, I'm not sure, I think so.
R:  Oh, I haven't seen that one.
L:  That was good.  And, ah, but I -- I've always liked Ghost.  That's one of my all time favorites, and Pretty Woman is an all time favorite too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When they come in I just -- they -- they come on and, ah, To Catch a Thief.  I usually like anything that, um, what is her name, is in, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, I can't remember her name.  The one in -- that's in, um, Pretty Woman, um --
R:  Ah, Julia Roberts?
L:  Julie Roberts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like pretty much like her movies, she's pretty good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, to Catch a Thief, that was really good.  [SIGH] She was good in that one.  That's when her husband was a weirdo, was a stalker, 'cause he was chasing her, she --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- he was abusive husband.  
R:  I haven't seen that one either.
L:  Yeah.  But -- but, I -- I like th- -- I think that if they keep up with the movies the way they have been, that, you know, it -- you want to go to the movies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  But, I think when you're young, that's about the only thing to do, well [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's the biggie.  I think when you're old, the same thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You sound kind of young.
R:  Yeah.  I'm twenty two.
L:  Huh?
R:  I'm twenty two.
L:  Yeah, see, I knew it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I knew it.  I'm in my fifties.  So, I -- I have a son your age, but he loves the movies too.  Did you think that the movies were getting kind of dull for a while there?
R:  Um, [SIGH] well, they're coming out with some really stupid ones, like they're -- it seems like they're just making sequels to everything.
L:  Well, I don't mind if they're exciting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, like if they're real interesting, like that, um, ah -- like that -- that, um, the mutants, you know, ah, X Twenty X, you know.  If they make it like that, what was it X Twenty?  X --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- X Men, that's what it was.  But, if they make 'em like that, then, you know, I'd go to see them all the time.  But, if they make it, if they do again what they did with, um -- um, Matrix, ah, I won't -- I won't spend the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, 'cause that to me is --
R:  It seems like they're making sequels to be making 'em.
L:  Yeah.  Because, to me, you better have a -- a -- you know, if you don't want to go see the "To be continued", then you're stuck --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because you get -- there's no ending.  So, I don't like when they do that.  To me it's like a rip off.  They're like trying to -- just trying to make money for the sake of making money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought they were doing it for my enjoyment.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought we're only supposed to talk for ten minutes.  My cell phone says it's been eleven something.  Eleven minutes --
R:  Yeah, I thought it was almost there.
L:  Yeah.  Does it seem like a long time?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm surprised they didn't come on yet and say -- oh [SIGH], I don't know what else to talk about.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hm --
L:  [MN] --
