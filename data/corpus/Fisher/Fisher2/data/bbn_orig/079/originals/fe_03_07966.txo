R:  Hi.
L:  Hello?
R:  I'm sorry, ran on top of you.  Hello, I'm Cindy.
L:  Hi, I'm Ellen.
R:  Hi, Ellen.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm in North Carolina.
L:  I'm in Ro- -- in, ah, New York.  Rochester, New York area --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- upstate.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where are you in North Carolina?
R:  I'm about mid-state.
L:  My daughter's moving down to Charlotte, um --
R:  Oh, is she?
L:  -- in a couple of weeks.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, she'll like Charlotte.
L:  She's going to be teaching for a public sc- -- well, not quite a p- -- I guess it's a public school.  A charter school's still public?
R:  Right, oh, kinda.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, what's she teaching?
L:  Um, seventh grade math.
R:  Oh --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- brave woman. [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon?
R:  She's a brave woman.
L:  Yes, I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  It's, ah, Lake Norman.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, she's in a great area.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  The people there are wonderful --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- so th- that helps a mom doesn't it?
L:  It does.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause we -- I don't know the area at all.
R:  It's a very pretty area.  Oh, I mean it's not that, "Boy, is this part of the state great" but around the lake there, oh, it's just lovely.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she'll be happy I think.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  There's a lot to do in that area.
L:  Good.  And she's already got her apartment picked out and her roommate from college --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- is going to go down with her and --
R:  What a great setup.
L:  -- so she's all excited.
R:  Yeah, she doesn't have to deal with, "I don't know anybody".  She's taking a friend with her, that's wonderful.
L:  Right.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's a help teaching to have somebody come home and -- and not complain to, but to -- to voice things to. [LAUGH]  So --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that'll help her.  Does she teach too?
L:  No, she's a, um -- she's looking for something in finance at a bank or something I guess.
R:  Oh, well banking is a big thing in Charlotte.  She ought to be okay.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  Sometimes things --
L:  She hasn't found anything yet but --
R:  It will.  Like at w- -- this time of the year I think everybody's looking but i- it -- you know, if you're going to be in this state that's the area to be in.  So she has the best luck she could have, so --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- good for them.  Sounds like they've got their future laid out for them.
L:  They do.
R:  Mm.
L:  Hopefully it'll work out.
R:  Oh, I hope so.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So do you think that the, um, public schools have serious problems?
R:  A- actually you don't know who you're talking to.  I was a home schooling mom.  I was a full time teacher so, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- been there done that.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but when it came time for my own child to go to school, she didn't fit the system necessarily.  They wanted to put a square peg in a round hole and I kind of liked my square peg [LAUGH] so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so she came home and I home schooled her for her entire school years.  She went to a public school for two years to see if she's missing something, found that no, "Can I come home, mom".  So I ended up teaching her twelve out of fourteen years at home.
L:  Wow, that's great.
R:  A- -- well, I -- being a teacher came naturally to me.  Not -- not that I'm that brilliant in high school math [LAUGH] but you learn along with your child so it worked out.  It was a challenge for both of us, but it worked out.
L:  I would imagine. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not that adamant that public schools are that awful or that they're not that great, but, ah, I -- I think it's a setup of the system that how can a teacher, ah, be brilliant about h- -- exactly how to reach one child out of thirty, thirty times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- every class she goes to?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, I feel for them.  It didn't happen to work out in my child's, ah, position, but I think the schools are trying as hard as they can.  I think, ah, they have a tough road right now.  It's -- it's tough to be a teacher right now I think.  When I did it, that was at a private school and, um, first grade.  So it was a whole lot easier.  It -- yeah, little people, good parents, a- -- that's a -- a whole lot different than your average public school I imagine.
L:  I would think so, yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  I work at a -- at a public school.  I work in the attendance office at a high school --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Attendance in a high school.  Well, you've got a job there.
L:  Yes.
R:  Are you the person who has to call up parents and say, "Blank didn't show up today"?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that must be hard.
L:  And lots of times it's not that they didn't show up, it's that the homeroom teacher missed them or m- --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, just marked the attendance wrong.
R:  Oh, poor parents.  What a phone call to get and your --
L:  It's --
R:  -- child is --
L:  -- it's --
R:  -- sitting there.
L:  -- it's awful.
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- you know, you call these parents and then they're like petrified and I hate it.  I just -- I hate doing it to them.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It puts you on the line there, doesn't it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Poor thing, that must --
L:  Then --
R:  -- must be so hard.
L:  -- we -- we can't interrupt classes to see if the child is in class --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause the teachers don't like that.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  It's like, "Well, if you don't like it, then do your attendance correctly".
R:  Exactly.  Boy.  The parent is paying the price here and the child in a sense is doing the same thing 'cause he's going to hear about this later.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And then they didn't do anything.  That's awful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It must be so stressful for you.
L:  It is in a way.  Um, but I really -- I enjoy the kids --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- and, um, it's a part time job.  I'm only there five -- five hours a day.  There's another woman in the office who's there fulltime.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it's not quite as bad, but [LIPSMACK] I'm, um --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and sometimes you have to be a little -- little bit sterner in an attendance office than I am.  I have a tendency to believe what the kids are telling me. [LAUGH]
R:  There's a mom in there, right?  You know, you think in the way of a mom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I understand completely.  Yeah.
L:  And it's not always good because sometimes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the kids aren't telling you what they should be telling you.
R:  Oh, yeah.  You gotta play cop at the same time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, but we had -- we -- I don't know if it's gone national or not, but there's been some problems in New York state and we have regions exams --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that are state, um -- the state makes up the exam and all the students have to take the exact same ex- exam across the state.
R:  That's like end of grade testing kind of, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So is it --
L:  And there was --
R:  -- that's just seniors?
L:  No, no.  It's all different subjects all through high school.
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  And there was an exam in math that you have to have to graduate --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that was just given a couple of weeks ago, and most of the students across the state failed it.
R:  Oh.
L:  And it meant that a lot of the students couldn't graduate --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so, um [LIPSMACK] there was a physics exam also that was questionable.
R:  Mm.
L:  And so there was -- there was a quite a few rallies, schools were getting together and parents were going and rallying to get these exams changed.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- that's one -- my daughter doesn't want to teach here because of these -- these regions exams.
R:  I can see why.
L:  She doesn't want to have to teach for an exam.
R:  That's exactly what you're doing.  You're spending your whole year teaching a test.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that is just not teaching.
L:  No.
R:  I -- I know a little about that from when I was teaching.  I -- we only did an attend--- oh, not attendance, an achievement test at the end of the year.  Teaching first graders there's a whole lot of panic [LAUGH] in the room about that.  So we were kind of told to teach the test.  Well, I don't -- as an educator I don't feel right about that.  But I also don't feel right about watching six year olds flunk for no reason.  So --
L:  Right, right.
R:  It's hard to know, you almost tend to teach the test, although the moral part of you is saying, "This is wrong, I can't do this".
L:  Mhm.
R:  But you tend to do it just because you know those people so well.  You know those parents so well.  You just do the best you think -- best thing you can for your chil- -- for your -- they're not yours, they feel like it --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- [LAUGH] for your students.  But i- it may not be the best thing morally, but you're doing your best.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's hard.
L:  It's very hard.  I -- I feel for these teachers.
R:  There is so much accountability now.  They have so much more paperwork to do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than I did but, you know, I didn't have to follow up every step of everything I did with a paper trip -- paper trail the way they do now.  And teaching is tiring anyway and to have to do that on top of it, I can see why so many teachers leave the system.  In this state, ah, a lot of parts of the state, not Charlotte, but a lot of them there is a huge teacher shortage and I think that's why so many teachers have just been forced out by the system pushing them.  You didn't go into education to do paperwork.  You went into education to teach.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, I -- I think teachers are born and I imagine your daughter's the same way.  You just -- you have a heart for it and you don't go into education unless you have that heart for it.  Not that it's a big crown on your head that, "Ooh, I'm a teacher", but it's just something that's in your blood.  Kind of like being a nurse, you're a --
L:  Right.
R:  -- certain kind of person if you're nurse, whether you want to be or not.  You just are. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I feel like teachers are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that a- --
L:  I think that's true.
R:  So you go into it with a such a heart for, "I want to help, I want to -- I want to see that light in a students eyes thing", and then you spend three fourths of your time doing paperwork and stress.  I can see why so many leave.  It's very sad but, ah, I can understand.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know --
L:  In New York there seems to be an excess of teachers.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, there's a lot of teaching colleges --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in New York and I think that's probably part of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think it's also why a lot of the -- the kids are graduating and going down -- down south to find jobs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's -- there's not jobs here.  The, um -- the teachers -- there's supposed to be because of teachers retiring --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they're not retiring up here.  Maybe in another couple of years they'll be at an -- an age where they need to, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're not.  She -- she would probably have had a really hard time finding a job --
