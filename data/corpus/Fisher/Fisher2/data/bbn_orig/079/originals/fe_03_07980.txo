L:  Andy.
R:  Susan.
L:  Hi. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  I'm doing all right.  Um, [NOISE] so, we're supposed to be talking about -- [MN] I didn't understand that, did you get that?  Susan?
R:  It was, like, how to have business hire with their own associations [NOISE] and how do you feel about it.
L:  How businesses --
R:  Hi-
L:  -- hire --
R:  -- hire within their [NOISE] own business [NOISE] to --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- gain employees or something like that. [NOISE]
L:  Uh, oh I see.  Well, I think it's really a good idea, you know, to -- you know, people that have been in the company for a longer time should be able to get maybe a higher job in the company, um, before they even look outside of the company.  Um, I think that's respectful to the emp- employees as well as the employers getting a good worker.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] Really?
L:  Yes, what do you think about that? [MN]
R:  I really have no opinion.
L:  Really? [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- what's the weather like out there where you're at? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we're supposed to be talking about this -- this, um --
R:  We can talk about the weather and jobs at the same time, how's that?
L:  No, um -- [SIGH] [COUGH] I have -- I've had jobs in, like, group homes, where, um, they've s- y- you -- you had to be, like, um, a -- a caretaker and then if you wanted to be something else in the office, they'd, like, rather hire the caretakers that were doing that before they all go out and -- and hire outside.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I really think that's, um, a wise -- I -- I think that's pretty wise to do, 'cause you don't want to get some blow Joe outside that doesn't know the business and he might know the job but he doesn't know the business and he doesn't know the people that worked for the company or anything like that, you gotta train and teach and -- and everything else in the company, you know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And the f- and how it goes and stuff.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Here, let me help you.  Well, that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sounds like a good [inaudible] by itself.
L:  Yes.  I -- I think it might -- I -- I -- I don't know.  So, um, how did you hear about this?
R:  Through my, it was through my husband.
L:  Oh -- oh, yeah?
R:  Mhm.
L:  How did hear hear -- how did he hear about it?
R:  From some chat line.
L:  You let your husband get on a chat line?
R:  [NOISE] He seems to enjoy that, like, every night.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow.  My wife has a hard time letting me get on there.  I enjoy it too, but my wife, like, throws a fit every time I get on there.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, but, uh, no, i- i- I'm -- this is the easiest thirty bucks I've made in my life.
R:  Really?
L:  [inaudible] Really.
R:  Well, you oughta tell your friends about it.
L:  Yeah, I should.  Have you told anybody about it?
R:  I don't know enough people up here in Oregon to tell anybody.
L:  Oh, you live in Oregon?  Yeah, I live in Texas and, uh, [NOISE] in Dallas, Texas, so --
R:  Boy, that's hot there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  But, you know, I'm a little Texan cowboy, so, you know, [NOISE] it's kinda nice.  I'm used to the heat. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, does your wife know you're doing this?
L:  Yeah, yeah.  She knows.
R:  What does she think about it?
L:  She thinks it's pretty funny.
R:  You think so?
L:  Yeah, she thinks it's pretty stupid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially when you can, like, talk to each other and talk about the same thing over the phone.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] So, it doesn't, like, place it in conflict. [NOISE]
L:  No.  But, no, about this -- [MN] about this busin- about this business, um, what about it?  Um, what do you -- what is your views about this?
R:  I really don't, like, have too much view or opinion on the matter, [NOISE] except that companies who hire within the company don't really give other people the oppo- opportunity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to be able to have a placement in their company and grow and be able to develop and, um, make things better for their company.
L:  But, if -- at -- but you gotta look, at the same time, the people that have been working in the company, don't you think that -- that they should be able to move up before a new person comes in?  Because I -- I've worked in a group home, like I said, and some lady that took the shift that I wanted, took the shift that I wanted and that I was there before she was and I trained her in how to work there and she -- she got my job, she got my shift and then took my job over, totally.  I had a lot of responsibility in -- in what I was doing and -- and she just, [MN] thinking that sh- because she was older and she thought, because she got the shift that -- that someone else that has been mo- there longer, [MN] he -- she thinks that she should have been able to take over and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I really don't think that was right, so I really don't -- I have a hard time, thinking that the people that are outside of the -- of the, uh, [COUGH] business shouldn't get the -- the shift or the job that -- that a person that has worked for the company for a longer period of time should get before that person did -- gets it.  I think that they should hire within and then when the bottom job comes up and, hey, that person can have that bottom job.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I -- I think that's totally fair.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that's totally a smart thing that companies do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I really do.
R:  Is to hire their own in -- their own people?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because down on the ro- down on the bottom end of it, there are going to be -- they're gonna be hiring people for the -- for -- because everybody's moving up, they're gonna be [MN] needing someone to -- on the bottom, so why can't blow Joe be on the bottom, instead of on the top when he doesn't know anybody and he hasn't been working in this busine- uh, company for a while?  Why -- why should he be on top of everybody else?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Do you see what I'm saying?
R:  Totally.
L:  So why do you s- think that it's -- why do you think it's not fa- why do you think it's not fair then?
R:  Why do I think it's unfair?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, there's always [NOISE] people out there needing jobs and I feel that [LIPSMACK] people should give -- be given e- equal opportunity.
L:  So -- so, let's say that you were working in a company, and -- and you've had -- you've been in this company for, hm, twenty years and -- and I come around [LIPSMACK] and I just got out of school, okay, I just gra- -aduated from hi- college and, man, I got experience but, hm, you got experience too, but, hm, you get paid more if you move up.  Mm-kay, well, oh, I just graduated from college and -- and -- and you -- and I apply for the job, so you think that I should get the job then?  That's what you're saying, you've been in the company for twenty years and -- and you think I should be able -- I -- I should have this -- I should ha- I -- they should come and hire me instead of you.  Do -- why's -- yeah, that's not fair, is it?  Is that fair to you?  Because you know the job, you've been in the business for twenty years, you've worked there for twenty years and you know what goes on, you've been taught how to do this other job, you've been taught how to do this other responsibility, but -- and you know that if you did this responsibility you'll get paid more.  There's an in- increase into your pay check.  So -- so, you think it, uh, you think you should -- you shouldn't be offered the job before me?
R:  It depends.
L:  It depends on what?
R:  It depends on your, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] your, um, experience --
L:  But I just said that I just graduated from college and -- and I have -- I've -- I've been taught the ins- responsibility, but you've had it, you've +taken care of the responsibility for a while now, but because the business is growing, they know that they need to hire someone to do that responsibility.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that you can do the job that you've been doing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- so you think it's fair for me to have the jo- the job instead of you?  You've been in the company for twenty years, I don't think that's fair.  I think you should have the job before -- before I was offered the job, 'cause you've worked there for twenty years and you've -- you've learned the -- the -- the, um ...
