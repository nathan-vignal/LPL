R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Not too bad.  I'm Robyn.
L:  I'm Wes.
R:  Uh, where are you located?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I'm located in Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in, actually, New York.
L:  New York. [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Yes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go figure.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Um, movies, well, at least that's an easy one, it's a lot easier than some of the other ones they've called me up and given me.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Okay. [NOISE] Um, we usually -- we usually rent re- movies.
R:  I'm -- I'm the same, I would -- I mean once in a while, you know, obviously there's nothing going on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'll go to the movies but I'm much -- I'll rent a movie two, three times a week, you know, just throw it in at night, you know, catch up on ones that I wanted to see and didn't, but, uh, I'm partial to being in my own house [LAUGH] and watching a movie.
L:  Right and then y- you know, you got your privacy of your own home and last time I was at a movie theater, you know, I was the only one laughing, it seemed like, uh, it was really weird, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it was, uh, what -- what did we see?  Uh, uh, Catch me if You Can.
R:  Okay, see I slept through that --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  I thought it was horrible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I did --
L:  I --
R:  -- I saw it with my sister and her husband and I, like, I slept through it, I thought it was so long and boring I was, like, "Okay --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- no thanks". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's the one we see- [MN] and then I -- I seen it alone because I w- I -- I'm a trucker, so my wife, uh, she -- she a lo- lot of times, uh, won't see it until I -- I come home or something, you know, and then I -- I watched it with her.  She liked it, I mean, it was -- it was long, you know, it was -- it w- you got to watch it real close, something you got to keep up on, but it was a true story, so I guess that's why we liked it.
R:  Yeah, I mean, that's interesting and the fact that the person exists and -- and is still alive was interesting, but --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- I just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I was, like, "Okay, catch him, already", you know, like --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I've had enough.
L:  He was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sneaky enough, though, for a young man, he was sneaky enough to -- to get away --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- with it, you know, which -- which --
R:  Amazing.
L:  -- uh, enthu- enthused me, you know, how he could, uh, scam the -- the fa- airlines and everybody else.
R:  [NOISE] Amazing.  Um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- let's see, the last movie I saw was the one with Bruce Willis, uh, Tears of the Sun [NOISE] where Bruce Willis is a -- a Navy Seal, uh, trying to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- extract some Americans from West Africa right before a war is about to break out --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it wasn't bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can't remember the last one we see -- we just rented it, it was with, um, it wasn't Bruce Willis, it was, um, oh, man, [SIGH] oh, he -- he, uh, he also played in, hm, hm, it was a navy movie, oh, gosh, I can't remember it right off hand. [NOISE] But we enjoyed it, I know we enjoyed it, I can't remember what it was, we watched it here at home, it just came out on DVD.
R:  Oh, I'm trying to think --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- can -- yeah, I'm -- I mean I'm partial to -- I'm partial to military --
L:  It --
R:  -- movies.  I'm -- I'm --
L:  It's a na-
R:  -- in the military, so --
L:  -- um, it's the name of a man, uh, his name, oh man, and I can't [NOISE] right off the top, I'd have to look in the -- in the book that we get every month. [LAUGH]
R:  Trying to think.
L:  Mm.  I can't remember.  But as far as going to movies, yeah, we don't -- we don't do that real often, you know, it's -- it's kinda costly --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- well, especially out here, I mean, a movie in New York City will [several inaudible words] plus you've got to get there, there's no parking --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, unless the movie is shown on base, where I mean, you know, military our -- our movies are three dollars, so unless it's shown on base, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just simply won't bother going just 'cause I don't want to fe- go through the hassle of getting there, so --
L:  Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, and that's -- that's the thing, we, you know, if we -- we plan on it, uh, we got eight grandkids, so it's harder to get to a movie and --
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  -- you know, i- uh, a lot of times we're interrupted and, uh, the kids want us to watch the kids, so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, what do you do?  You -- you rent a movie and a lot of times we'll get movie for the kids, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So we all can watch.
R:  I think it's great, I mean, I'd rather sit in the comfort of my own home, I can turn off the, you know, I can turn the screen off when I want to, I can pick up the phone and not have to worry about missing anything, I can eat dinner, I can do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- whatever I want, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I would much rather be in the comforts of my own home.
L:  [NOISE] Right --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- right.  Right, I -- I -- I do too, you know, you can put it on pause when the telephone rings, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's nice, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's what I enjoy.
R:  [inaudible] popcorn, candy, you can eat dinner, you can do whatever you want.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, [NOISE] well, what --
R:  But I --
L:  -- do you do until -- in -- you gotta talk for ten minutes?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I guess so, I've done this, oh, one other time and it was, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the topic was very different, I mean, movies are -- are -- are easy, I mean you can always pull out a new movie --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I haven't -- I'm trying to think of what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I saw.  I rented a movie the other day actually when I was -- 'cause it's done nothing but rain here, [inaudible].
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH] Every weekend.  The week days are beautiful and then as soon as the weekend comes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it rains, so --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- this --
L:  -- we --
R:  -- weekend was the first nice weekend we've had all summer.
L:  Really?
R:  So -- yeah, so everybody was just renting movies, I mean, you'd go to the movie shop and there was a million people there, 'cause --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- everybody was just fed up, they were like, "I can't stay inside any more", but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was, you know, it's pouring out so --
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, we -- we've had nice weather during the weekends, I'm really surprised, I -- I'm, uh, usually out all week and maybe get home in the weekends, you know, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't have to drive to New York, which is nice, I like that, so --
R:  Yeah, I know --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- this place is a nightmare --
L:  -- you know, but --
R:  -- I don't blame you.
L:  -- but when I -- when I get a little time, I like to, uh, hit a movie if I can and doggone it, I can't find the sheet to tell you which one we've seen last. [NOISE] My wife usually has it right here and she doesn't but, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- anyways --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for ten minutes, I can't think of anything else to say.
R:  I know, yeah, it's a lot and you can run out of things --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- I mean there's -- I said after a while you run out of things to say.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm trying to think of what's out now, you know, we -- actually Father's Day, my -- my father and I decided we were going to go see a movie and we literally opened up the paper and could not find a single movie that sounded even remotely interesting.  We --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we ended up not going, I mean, everything was, like, silly movies or, you know, PG thirteen movies or kids' movies, we were hard pressed to find anything we wanted to see that looked even remotely decent.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  So, I know --
L:  That --
R:  -- the first phase of summer movies is not impressive.
L:  My wife's pretty picky about what we watch, you know, she -- she likes comedies and romances, so, we see a lot of them.  So, that's --
R:  Yeah, see my mom's the same way, my dad and I are like, "No, we want to see war movies, we want to see political movies", so when mom's away, dad and I, uh, go see the movies we want to see.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, see, and my wife don't like w-
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- war movies, so we don't go to see them and she don't like suspense, so we don't watch them, you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- know.  So, what do you wo- you know, you go for comedies and romances, you know, that's about it.
R:  And there are a lot of dumb comedies out there right now --
L:  [NOISE] Oh --
R:  -- hoo.
L:  -- I know it, I know it.
R:  My parents went and saw [inaudible] Bruce Almighty, my dad hated it, he said it was just stupid.
L:  [LAUGH] What was that one, uh, my daughter wanted me to see that one where that guy changes, uh, all the time, um, he changes his -- his, uh, impressions or his -- his ways, uh --
R:  Oh, I think that's Bruce Almighty.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my dad saw it and he said, well, he doesn't like stupid comedy, though, he doesn't like, like, the slapstick sort of stuff and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he -- he said he couldn't stand it, he thought it was ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, see that's why I didn't want to -- I didn't even want to rent it.  Gail read it on the back and she --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- says, "No, we ain't gonna watch this, it sounds real stupid" and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we seen the -- we seen the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- previews --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the TV so we decided, "Ah, nah, we don't need to watch this".
R:  No.
L:  You know, and it was --
R:  I do- I'm like my dad, I don't like stupid comedy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, like, there's some -- I can watch some stuff, but the real slapstick --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- that's --
L:  -- right.
R:  -- not me.
L:  Right, right.
R:  No, thanks.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I don't even know what's -- what's out right now, being on the road right now, I don't get to see what's -- what's -- what's coming up or -- or anything, you know, to see if we want to really watch one and go rent one, you know, 'cause we're always -- we're always renting movies, my -- right now, we got a free movie we can rent, but we- you know, I didn't have time, last night was Rhythms and Booms in Madison, which is a big fireworks display, it's a big to do and we went there and, uh, you know, it seems like when you co- uh, when I come home I don't have time.
R:  Yeah, you run out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and full two hours you need to see a whole movie.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- it's -- it's crazy, [MN] it would be nice though, because, you know, it gives us time to relax and -- and if we want to talk we can talk to the movie, you know, as we see a boring spot.
R:  Yeah.  And that's --
L:  You know.
R:  -- one of the convenient of being not in a movie theater is that you don't have to worry about, even at the boring spots, sitting there and being quiet and disturbing other people, or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- being disturbed by other people.
L:  Right, right.  And you kno- -- you know [MN] what I like is when we go down, we -- and we want to get a drink of water or getting disturbed we can put that thing on pause and then go on with our business, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and then come back and you don't miss nothing.  'Cause I notice --
R:  Much --
L:  -- when -- when we go to the movie house, even if I go to a movie house I'll rent it again and I'll miss some things.
R:  It's true, I don't realize that I didn't, you know, I'll -- I'll watch a movie and sometimes I'll watch a movie in the beginning and be, like, "Did I see this?  Did I forget?"
L:  Right, right --
R:  Because --
L:  -- I know it.
R:  -- it seemed like I don't remember it and I don't remember the beginning, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so sometimes it's worth it to see it again.
L:  It is, it really is, so -- you mean ten --
R:  But, uh --
L:  -- minu- you mean ten minutes aren't up yet? [LAUGH]
R:  It should be very soon, they usually -- they'll pop up and give you, like, a thirty minute -- a thirty second warning --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- okay.
R:  -- then, uh, oh, yeah, as long as they don't forget about us, you know.
L:  Yeah, right, right, right.  But, uh, yeah, I --
R:  But I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- plan -- as long as the weather holds out, I don't plan on watching any movies any time soon.  I can't sit in a movie theater though, when the weather's nice.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  --I feel guilty --
L:  -- that's what --
R:  -- you know? [LAUGH]
L:  -- su- that's what summer's all about, you know, is -- is, uh, you know, on a rainy days you can watch a movie and then, uh, on nice days you can go out, you know --
R:  And save -- save --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- the movies for the --
L:  -- today --
R:  -- winter time --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and -- and the --
L:  -- today --
R:  -- crappy -- and the crappy weather --
L:  -- today it's, uh, seventy eight here and sunny.
R:  Beautiful.
L:  Beautiful day --
R:  You can't --
L:  -- beautiful day.
R:  -- you can't ask for better than that.
L:  Yeah, you guys have got rain again this day?
R:  No, this weekend was the first clear weekend, so everybody's out and about ...
