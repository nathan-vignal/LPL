R:  Hello.
L:  Hey, I'm Dan.
R:  Hi, I'm Cratchey[?].
L:  What's going on?
R:  Oh, just relaxing.  How about you?  Where are you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- located?
L:  Um, right now I'm at a train station in Chunten[?], New Jersey.
R:  Where?
L:  Chunten, New Jersey.
R:  Okay.  So, why don't you start?
L:  Okay, well, [NOISE] um, I think -- I think I'd be willing to do it.  I think it's a big, uh, decision but I mean it is a million dollars.
R:  You would be?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  I don't think I would be actually.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I -- I really cannot think that -- I mean, I -- I do think that money is definitely important but -- but I think money is important, I mean, as long as it can give you happiness.  For me I don't think I'll be content or be happy --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with that kind of money if I cannot talk to p-, uh, somebody and especially to my best friend.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, it gives me happiness when I spend that money and more than that --
L:  Mm.
R:  If I am able to share it with somebody how I spend the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- money and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I don't --
L:  Well, I think -- oh, sorry.  I think it'd --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- be different if they said that you had to stop speaking to all of your friends and your loved ones.  But, I mean, one best friend.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Isn't --
R:  I would think my one best friend would be my spouse.  
L:  Okay.
R:  So, for -- for me it's -- it's just impossible.  It seems impossible to me.
L:  Right, see --
R:  To -- to be able to --
L:  I mean, I'm only twenty so it's just like one of my good buddies but, you know, I still have the rest of my group of friends.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't, uh, don't even think if it's somebody else also I can still do it because to me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- then friends are really important in my life and, I mean, I -- I don't unders- -- I mean, these days you earn so much money I don't understand what is the use of earning that much money when you don't even have the time to spend it.  So, I see this kind of money also in the same way like you're giving up something which is really dear to you then -- then how can something else give you, I mean, take place of that thing and give you that happiness, that joy, that feeling of content?
L:  But I think that with a million dollars you can, you know, like you don't have to be career oriented any more.  You can spend a lot more of your time doing stuff that you love that [NOISE] like it makes up for it. [NOISE]
R:  I don't know because -- because [NOISE] money would come and go --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but --
L:  Not a million dollars. [NOISE]
R:  But [LAUGH] -- [NOISE] but even a million dollars wouldn't stay forever.
L:  It'd stay for a damn long time.
R:  Oh, I don't know if I could [LAUGH] ever even think of doing that.
L:  I -- I mean, I guess -- I guess for you it's your spouse and, I mean, that's a lot more important in your life than, you know, one of my -- like one of my buddies.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I mean, I guess we just view the situation differently. [MN] Like I don't think for a million dollars, like, when I grow up I -- I don't think for a million dollars I'd give up my -- my spouse.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, I think it's just different situations.  Different strokes for different folks.
R:  That's true.  That's true.  But I -- I just cannot put myself in somebody else's shoes in things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like that.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] I don't know.  That [NOISE] -- it's -- it's a lot of money.
R:  I know that is a lot of money. [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But -- but I guess, yeah, it depends on -- on --
L:  Like I think -- I think --
R:  -- what phase of life you are and on -- one what kind of priorities do you have.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I mean, the thing is like you could do so much with that though.
R:  Yeah, that is true but --
L:  You know? [NOISE] 
R:  But -- but you cannot do everything with money.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But you can -- you can do a lot more with your time and stuff that would be centered around things that you wanna do rather than centered around making -- you wouldn't have to worry about making money any more. [NOISE]
R:  But then wouldn't you want to spend more time with your friends and loved ones.
L:  Right. [NOISE] And not all of them it's just one of them. [NOISE]
R:  I mean, we -- you anyway have very few best friends to say in whom you can confide, um, whom you can share everything with.  So 
L:  Uh, I don't know.  Like I think that like I could be able to help like humanity so much more too.  Like if you could spend all your time like helping people.
R:  What?  Say that again.
L:  If you could spend all your time helping people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Rather than trying to make money.
R:  Yeah, that would be a good idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Then I mean, for -- for all humanity it's a -- it's a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- more important thing. [MN]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know, you could make a long term difference rather than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- being able to like --
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's -- that's what I said --
L:  -- go to the movies with your friend.
R:  Depends on what kind of priorities.  That -- that gives you a different kind of joy altogether and --
L:  Right.
R:  And that makes you busy.  That makes you even busier then than what you would now be.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  And then definitely you don't have the time and then you're doing it for a greater cause.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, then -- then I -- now I can totally understand if -- if that is your -- and then probably one might do it.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, that -- that would be difficult but -- but that's a greater cause and --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Then one might consider.  Then even I might consider doing it because [NOISE] --
L:  Okay.
R:  That -- that's a much greater cause.
L:  Yeah.  But I see --
R:  [MN]
L:  I see what you're saying -- where you're coming from a different situation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like with your spouse and like the one that you found.
R:  And now I can understand, uh, what you're saying.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  Plus you can have some really nice stuff.
R:  Hm.
L:  I'm not gonna lie. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, what do you think will you do with those million dollars?  Apart --
L:  Um --
R:  -- from you said -- you said you would set it for a part of it for charity and humanitarian you something.  So, what do you plan to do with those million dollars?
L:  A big ass car.  First off.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
L:  And, uh, I don't know.  I'd be able to live comfortably.  Like [inaudible] a lot of luxuries in my home.  Um, [LIPSMACK] like move to where I want; not have to worry about looking for professions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I don't know.  Do something that I really love.
R:  [LAUGH] Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  What about you?
R:  Uh, I guess I wanna use more of it for charity.  I cannot --
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I'm pretty --
L:  All right.
R:  -- content with my life.  I'm not that kind of a person who wants --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of money.  I think I'll go on crazy [LAUGH] if I get that kind of money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would not know what to do with that kind of money.
L:  All right.
R:  So, I would probably use it for a greater cause.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [inaudible].  I mean, I think I have, uh, I get enough for my life and I just need sufficient to keep my -- to have a shelter on my head and to --
L:  All right.
R:  -- get something to eat and to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- lead a decent life.  So --
L:  It's a good deal.  Good deal.
R:  Yeah.  I don't think I'm really into having a good car and I don't want a big house or something.  I -- I would be happy in a small home too.
L:  Are you gonna --
R:  I --
L:  -- tell me that you wouldn't want those things though?  Like obviously --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- those aren't the most important things but [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like if I had a million dollars I wouldn't give it all away.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So  [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know.  So, where are -- where are you right now?
R:  I am in Delaware.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Good deal.
R:  So y- -- so you're getting back from work?
L:  Uh, no I -- I'm in -- I live in Philadelphia.  I go to a school there and, uh --
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm going away for the weekend.
R:  Mhm.  Okay.  Isn't it pretty hot these days now it's become suddenly so hot now?
L:  Right, see I -- I have to work outside all day.  I work at the zoo and I was outside all day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]
R:  The winter was very extreme this year and so is going to be the summer looks like.
L:  [MN] Uh, so where do you think -- where do you think you'd donate all the money?  How do you think you'd distribute it?
R:  What?  Say that again.
L:  How -- how do you think you'd distribute the money?  Where do you think you'd donate it?
R:  I -- I guess that -- that's going to be a long -- long procedure because I don't want -- want my money if it's my money so [inaudible] to go into the wrong hands so I would have to do a big survey of where all do I want to give that charity money for and if it's going into the right place and for the right cause.
L:  Mm.
R:  I w- -- um, I would like to donate it to the people who -- who cannot even put aside their basic needs and my, uh, way of doing it would not be giving them the food for today but be helping hi- -- them get in employment or --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- learning some skill which would make themselves dependent rather than just providing them food for a day.
L:  Ri-
