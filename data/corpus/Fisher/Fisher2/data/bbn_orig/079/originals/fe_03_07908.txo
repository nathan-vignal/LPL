R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm Kendra.
R:  Hi, I'm Hope.  [NOISE] [PAUSE] What was the question relating to?
L:  [LIPSMACK] It was -- if we were, um, given a million dollars by a benefactor [SIGH] and the only thing was we could not speak to our best friend again.   [PAUSE]
R:  Hm, how do you feel about that?
L:  I think I would do it.
R:  I think I would, too.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's kind of cynical isn't it?
L:  [LAUGH] It is, but ...
R:  I don't know, I ha -- I have the, like, several good friends, so, I don't know, it's kinda hard, I -- I think I talk to my best friend, like, three or four times a day --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH] 
R:  Don't you?
L:  [SIGH] Well, no, not really, because I -- [MN] I have the same thing, I have like, a coupla good friends, but, I can't really say that I even have a best friend --
R:  A best, best friend, yeah.
L:  You know, so, I wouldn't even know --
R:  I have several best friends.
L:  Yeah, so, I wouldn't know, like, which one to -- which one I would choose to -- you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which one they would tell me I would have to stop talking to.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  Hm.  A million dollars would come in handy.
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You could do a lot with that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. What part of the, um, country do you live in?
L:  Um, I'm on the east coast.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in north -- north east.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never done this before -- this is --
R:  I --
L:  -- my first call.
R:  Me, too.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know -- I thought you were experienced.
L:  [SIGH] No, so, I didn't know --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- what to expect.
R:  Yeah, I did- -- I didn't either, um, I'm usually a stay home mom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I do a lot of volunteer work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, somebody told me about the website, and I'm like, "Cool".  But, yeah, I would definitely take the million dollars, and I don't know how long you have to talk, and I don't know, you know, if you even get, ah, reimbursed or not, but, um, it sounds pretty good, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I thought I'd give it a shot.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, I think it's supposed to be ten minutes -- a ten minute phone call, um, and I think it's, like, ten dollars --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- so ...
R:  Strange.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you have a full time job?
L:  [SIGH] No, I'm also a stay at home mom, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] but, I work part time two days a week, for --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- for a financial advisor.
R:  Oh, that's fun.
L:  So ...
R:  I do landscaping.
L:  Okay.
R:  That's what I like to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's my fun time.
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  Sixteen, eleven and seven.
L:  Okay.
R:  They would definitely like the million dollars.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, that's it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my sixteen year old, for sure.
L:  You could do so much with that money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I could buy him a real cool sports car.
L:  Yeah, ah, and pay for college, and -- and everything.
R:  I'd have fun first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, worry about that later -- I wouldn't -- I don't if I'd -- I don't think I'd move from where I live.
L:  No?
R:  I don't think I would.  To tell you the truth, I don't think I would.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  [MN] Maybe I would -- I would live next to the beach -- I miss the ocean, there's no --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ocean where I'm at.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, it's incredibly difficult when you are so used to having an ocean.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know if you have an ocean where you're at, but --
L:  No.
R:  -- um --
L:  Well, we're like two -- we're about an hour and a half, two hours from the beach, so, it's not too bad.
R:  Oh, that's not bad at all.
L:  It's not bad.
R:  There's like -- there's no way -- we're like cities and towns and many hours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Yep -- how old are your children?
L:  Um, six and three.
R:  Oh, wow, they're little still.
L:  Just little ones, yeah -- yes.
R:  Do you have boys or girls?
L:  Ah, a boy and a girl.
R:  Okay, I have all boys.
L:  Oh, my, gosh, three boys.
R:  Mhm --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they're very hy- -- they're hyper.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Most boys are -- I know my son is.
R:  Yeah, I don't know -- I wouldn't know what to do with girls.
L:  Ah --
R:  I have --
L:  -- I was so thankful I had a girl.
R:  Really?  I --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I wish I had a girl, but we don't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd probably go shopping with her.
L:  [SIGH] That's what I do.  [LAUGH]
R:  I wish my sixteen year old was a girl -- that would be so much fun, I'd take him and -- if she -- if he was a girl I'd take her and her friends to go shopping --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on a shopping spree, for sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That would be, like, so cool to do.
L:  That would be very cool.
R:  I would buy the school that he's going to -- I would build a gym --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and dedicate it to my son.
L:  Oh --
R:  That would --
L:  -- that's a neat idea.
R:  That would be cool, and give back to the community.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Isn't that great?
L:  That would be really cool.
R:  And, for sure he would make the team next time.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just kidding.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's it.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny.
L:  That is neat.
R:  Yeah, [MN] I think they're recording the whole conversation, but, I'm not sure.
L:  Yes.
R:  They are?
L:  That's what they said they were doing.
R:  Yeah, so, [NOISE] I don't know [NOISE] ...
L:  [MN]
R:  It's -- [MN] I usually put on there to call me in -- in the morning, but, I put any time of the day.
L:  Mhm.  Is it -- is it late where you are?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's actually very late --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where I'm at.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Me too.
R:  It's -- it's like, almost eleven o'clock -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- my time zone.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's probably later where you're at?
L:  It is -- it's almost twelve --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so ...
R:  See, I would -- my husband would of freaked out if he got this phone call.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my --
R:  But, this is a new -- this, ah, survey type thing, isn't it?
L:  Yes.  Yeah, well, that's what I thought it was -- I thought they would be asking the questions, and --
R:  Yeah, well, no, I -- I read into the -- the agreement and the clause, and it said something to the effect that [SIGH] you have to talk about the topic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, with a -- with a certain amount of time, and you have to discuss --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it, so, ah, the topic for me would be basically pretty easy, because we would both take the million dollars and ditch our best friend.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, and as I said it -- it's just -- it would -- like, for me it would be, like, what -- you know what I mean?  I don't really have a best friend, but, you know, I have quite a few friends that I consider good friends [SIGH], but, if they would say, "Pick your best friend", I don't think I'd really be able to.
R:  Yeah ... hm, what if your best friend was your husband?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  Many women do have their husbands as best friends, and --
L:  That's very true, but, then --
R:  -- what can --
L:  -- what [MN] -- what would that be?  You'd never be able to talk to them again, so, what?  You'd have to get a divorce, or ...
R:  I mean, isn't that weird though, I mean, 'cause a lot of people don't assume that their husbands are best friends.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Well, I don't know -- it depends how long you've been married.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it does --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you know, you can call your husband a lot of different things, like, your confidant, and you know, and your friend, and -- but, your companion, and -- but, I don't know if you'd really -- you know?  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  A million dollars would sure [NOISE] -- let me see, what could I do with a million dollars?  Hm.  [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You could do lots of things.
L:  What would be the first thing that you would do?  [NOISE]
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if my mom was alive --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would build her a dream home.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  Um, the first thing I would do -- I would probably not do anything for a whole year --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- or, six months, because, you just get crazy and you don't know what you're doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I would just sit on it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and think about what I needed to do -- [SIGH] maybe hire an attorney --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, [MN] so, I -- there wouldn't be any problems -- I would like to try to invest, ah, for my children, first and +foremost -most --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, probably rebuild the house where I'm at --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um ... like I said, I would -- I would like to build a, um, a gym under, you know, someone's name -- maybe I can name it, anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, my mom's name -- I don't know, anything --
L:  I'd like that idea -- that's really neat, giving back to the community like that.
R:  Yeah, something like that.  I don't know -- but, they could sure use another gym -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's a brand new school, but, you know, I think [MN] if -- doing something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the community would be good.  I guess, 'cause I do so much volunteer work that, I think, in that -- in those terms, you know, especially having older kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, knowing all the high school students, and it's kinda fun when you get involved at that level --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause um, it's -- it's quite an experience, um, they all know you -- they get to know you, and you get to know the kids and so, it's like, "Hi mom -- hi mom ..." --
L:  That's neat.
R:  -- it's really neat.
L:  That's very neat -- I know, I'm just getting involved right now in my son's school.
R:  But, you know at elementary level it's very petty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, there's moms who wanna take all the credit, who have been there for a while, and they just, you know, ah, it's -- they just wanna run it -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- their show -- it's their show -- it's about them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, when you get to middle school and high school it's no longer like that.  It depends what kind of people you encounter.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But, um, I -- if I were you I wouldn't get involved so much in the PTA --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I would get involved in reading to the younger children, um, maybe setting up a -- a programme with a million dollars to get, ah, volunteers to come in and read.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  I mean, you can always get, ah, senior citizens to come and read to the children, or, even provide, [MN] ah -- ah, transportation, so, they could come out from the resident homes and come and read to the children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because a lot of them are [NOISE] willing to do volunteer work --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, since they don't have the funds or the money, [NOISE] um, this would be a good way.
L:  Not even really in the elementary, um, schools, but, even for, like, my preschooler, or toddlers, I think that would be really a ni- -- a neat idea, to do like a toddler's story time, and --
R:  You know what another thing would be great for the young children to ...
