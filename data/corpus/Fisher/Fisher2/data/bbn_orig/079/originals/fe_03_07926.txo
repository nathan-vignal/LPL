R:  [SIGH] Hi, my name is Stephanie.
L:  Uh, my name is Pam.
R:  Hi, Pam.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good.  Where are you --
L:  Good.
R:  -- calling from?
L:  Uh, Saint Louis.
R:  Ah, I'm in --
L:  Missouri.
R:  -- Cambridge, Massachusetts.
L:  Ah, okay.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Second, actually.
L:  Oh, this is my first one.
R:  Ah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, tell me, what are we -- we're discussing here.  The --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- public schools?
R:  We're supposed to decide if anything's wrong with the public school system and if so, what can be done to correct it?
L:  What can be done about it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Do you d- have kids in the school system or ...?
R:  No, I graduated from public schools [LAUGH] though.  I was born --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in, um, seventy five.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Nineteen seventy five so I'm -- I'm not with kids yet.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  I have children.
R:  How about you?
L:  I graduated from the public schools and then I have children that are in the public schools.  They've also been in a private school too but right now they're in the public schools.
R:  Oh, it's interesting they went back.
L:  So, yeah.  One of them went to the private schools for, I guess, through third or fourth grade.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Huh.
L:  And now she's, uh, getting ready to go into high school.  She's in the public schools now.
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah, so ...  I felt like I got a very good education [COUGH] in the --
R:  I did --
L:  -- public schools.
R:  I did too.  Um, uh, my- -- both my parents are public high school teachers.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, my dad taught in my high school.  I went to a small -- really small high school in New York.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, but, you know, graduating class was, er, sixty four, sixty five people.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And my experience was that, you know, I thought that the public school system was fine.  I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sometimes I felt like, you know, I wish that there were different classes or more things offered but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the realization was that we weren't paying for it so ...
L:  Exactly, you got what ya --
R:  Or we're paying through taxes but --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- you know, not --
L:  Right.
R:  -- out of pocket.
L:  Right, exactly, yeah.  I mean, I thought I was very well prepared for college.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mean I went to -- to a fairly small school too.  It was, um -- I think there was about maybe a hundred in my class.  Which was small for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the Saint Louis area.
R:  Oh, definitely.  
L:  A lot of -- a lot of the schools had about five to six hundred kids in their graduating class so, um --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- but I thought I was really well prepared for college.  I mean [COUGH] I did well in college [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  I felt like they -- they taught me all the basics and things and, um, I think [MN] actually back then they offered more extra curricular then they do now for my kids.
R:  Huh.
L:  'Cause now I feel --
R:  That's interesting.
L:  -- like they, um, use the money more for, you know, they have the computer classes and they have, um, a lot more of the business oriented classes which we didn't have a lot of.  We had the basics.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but there was more, um, clubs and after school activities and things.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, in -- in my school district, I know they had a hard time finding advisors --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And also every year there would be budget votes where --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there --
L:  they'd have to --
R: --  was a lot of retirement --
L:  -- cut something.
R:  Yeah, there was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lot of retirement.  People in my community where I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- grew up so every year the sports -- you know, the -- the -- there would be a vote about should there be sports, should there be a library and things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  And every year like after the vote, they were passed but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we'd be [LAUGH] really scared for a while though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It'd be --
L:  Well, that's what's happened in our school district now is things have been cut.  You know, a lot of the sports, um, mostly for girls unfortunately.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and [MN] th- that they've chosen to cut sports and music programs.  Extra music programs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, not the academics which I g- that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um -- but, no, I f- I feel like my children get a good education and even compared to the private school.  The private school was, um, more challenging for them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but it was also stricter and more regimented. They don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- encourage a lot of free thinking there.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, they bas- -- they want everything to be the same --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- in the private schools.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which I -- I -- I would rather have them have the creativity and the freedom of thinking independently.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And I feel like when I -- I mean the question asked about is there something wrong with the -- the public school system?  I feel like, I mean, having seen a little bit of the disparities in New York city --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] between like the different public schools then, you know, yes, there might be something wrong there.  And also, sort of, the -- the [MN] -- I don't know if this is the right word but like de facto segregation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like the fact that in a lot of places, even with -- even with it being public, like, you know, it's just not very diverse.
L:  Well, [MN] St Louis --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- has a real big, um, desegregation program here and [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, they do bussing and stuff?
L:  Yes, they had a lot of controversy with it and, um, [NOISE] there is a big difference between the, um -- the inner city schools and the schools in the county, um, in terms of how much funding they get and how, um -- not even just the safety wise but just in terms of what they are +provided and what they are allowed to have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, there is a big difference.  So I, you know -- the inner city schools e- er, and not even the inner city just the city schools in general in St Louis, do have a, um -- they have a lower drop out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean they have a higher drop out rate [NOISE] and a lower [NOISE] um, graduating -- going on to college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's all a +reflection -- reflection of, I think, the public school system in the cities.
R:  Now --
L:  You know?
R:  -- do you [inaudible] there's something wrong with that or is that just the way that it is and it doesn't need to be corrected?
L:  Well, I think there is something wrong.  I think it has to do with the fact that -- that people are moving out of the cities into the suburbs.
R:  Okay.
L:  And that there's not money for 'em.  I don't -- I don't [MN] -- I think it's more a financial problem.
R:  So, then what do you do?
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Redistribute the wealth from the suburbs into the cities.  And sort of have the suburb folks subsidize the cities or --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- give -- give --
L:  -- I think they should --
R:  -- more government aid to the -- the cities or ...?
L:  I think they should actually allow more options.  Um, we have something here called magnet schools that are city schools.  Um, they're public schools but you --
R:  Oh, these are specialization?  Where you can ...?
L:  Yeah, they're specialized more.
R:  Okay.
L:  Where they have one's like a military academy, one's like a science and technology, one's a music --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and arts one.  And people -- you apply to them and you're taken just on a lottery system.  You don't have to pay to go there.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But it's an option.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For people instead of being bussed around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you choose to go here.  Even like the charter schools.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know, I think that's a better option.  One of those two then necessarily having the government, you know --
R:  Come in.
L:  -- come in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and give more money.  You know?
R:  Yeh.
L:  So ...  But, yeah, I think in general people get a good education.
R:  I also think that --
L:  In the public schools.  
R:  I mean I feel like if people --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- wanna get a good educ- education they can.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I feel like -- like a lot of, you know -- a lot of the problems with the schools and this is biased as being a school teacher's daughter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but a lot of problems is that many folks who go there often just don't wanna be in school.
L:  Right, it's --
R:  So, it's --
L:  -- their social situation that --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- causes the problem not necessarily the education.
R:  The school itself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like if everyone was committed to learning then that would be one thing but in reality that's not how it happens.
L:  Right, they're not.
R:  So ...
L:  And that does cause people to not get a good education if they don't want --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be there. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, both your parents taught?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My -- my dad teaches -- he used to teach high school physics and now he teaches science to middle schoolers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At a school called, um, Buckley, in -- 
L:  Uh.
R:  -- in, um, Rhinebeck, New York.  And --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my mom teaches at the -- the next town over.  She teaches special ed to high schoolers.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, wow.
R:  So she does like history and math and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, [MN] things like how to balance a check book.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Like more like --
L:  More practical things.
R:  More like survival skills than --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, high level calculus. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  [SIGH] So ...
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, they've been doing it for a while.  And my sister, um -- my sister, Liesl, is a math teacher in Texas but she's moving actually to Boston to begin teaching in the Natick school system district which is like a suburb of Boston.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] And, um, yeah.
L:  Wow, everybody's -- are you a teacher?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm going -- I'm going to nursing school soon so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's a -- 
R:  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  -- that's a helping profession.  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope so, yeah.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nobody in my family is a teacher.  Well, actually, I have some nephews that are teaching.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In, um -- in the h- high school and junior high level.  Um, some nephews and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- some nieces.  But that's about it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Never been th- -- had anybody else that was in -- in that field.  Huh.
R:  Yeah, I grew up just kind of taking, you know -- taking it for granted that my parents would always have the summers off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, you know, now that I'm entering the working world, I've, you know, been --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- working for a few years and I don't get my summers off and --
L:  Yeah, you don't get three months off.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Like, "Whoa, what's going on here?  Did I choose the wrong profession?"
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, really.
R:  So ...
L:  Aren't we supposed to get a couple of weeks off at Christmas?
R:  At least.
L:  And, uh -- oh, man.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Was your -- was your -- one of your parents your teachers?  Your dad?
R:  Yeah, my dad actually --
L:  Was he really?
R:  -- taught me.  Taught me in eleventh grade.
L:  Was that strange or ...?
R:  Um, I mean I definitely felt like I needed to do my homework and, you know, pay attention in class but --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- I- I've struggled with the subject.  I mean, physics didn't come easy to me.  
L:  No, that was a hard one.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, huh, I thought.
L:  Yep.  Yeah, that was a hard one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember my physics teacher in high school.  He was very fun though.  Not at all like my college one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, good, yeah, yeah.
L:  That one was a scary one.
R:  Yeah, no, I think -- I think my dad was good 'cause he had lots of experiments.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So you were able to like --
L:  Yeah, that's what we did.
R:  -- do hands on instead of just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- memorizing formulas so ...
L:  Then having somebody up there lecture to you and you're going, "Uh, hold on".  
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Don't know what you're talking about.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Wow.  So d- have you, uh -- you said this was your second call?
R:  Second call, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I think --
L:  That was -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Go ahead.
R:  I think -- yeah, I'm just doing three of them or so.  What were you going to say?
L:  I was just going to say I had, uh, signed up a couple of weeks ago but this is my first one.
R:  Yeah, it kinda c- took you by surprise when the phone rang, I was like --
L:  I know.
R:  -- "Hello, hello".  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought, "Oh, my gosh.  They're on the answer --"
R:  [MN] [MN]
L:  "-- machine, I'd better --"
R:  [MN] 
L:  "-- get it".
R:  [MN] [SIGH]
L:  I thought somebody would be right there.  You know, it'd be a person calling me actually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- instead of a --
R:  A machine.
L:  -- a m- -- you know.  A machine doing it but, uh, I was kinda wondering if I was gonna get one or not.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, yeah.
L:  'Cause it's been a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How'd you hear about it?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Through the Internet.  I don't know.
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  Yeah, I don't know --
