R:  Hello.
L:  Hello there.
R:  Oh, hi.
L:  All right.  I just got a coughing spell, wouldn't you know it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, do you need to go?
L:  No, I'm fine, it's just sinuses.  I'll get over it.  Just pardon me if I bark in your ear.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, what was the last movie you saw?
R:  Actually, the last movie I saw at the m- -- at, ah, the movies, ah, I think, was Scooby Doo.  My husband and I took my [LAUGH] grandson.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We -- we tend to rent videos.
L:  Yeah, same here.  Although I'll go to the theatre maybe, oh, once or twice a year if it's a -- if it's a good movie.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The last movie I saw at the theatre was [LAUGH], um, X Men.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, we saw the, um -- we did see the, ah, um, ... Scooby Doo, and -- and that's about [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's about what -- you know, that's about our speed.  And my husband will go every now and then with our -- we've got teenage sons --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they'll go see these action movies that I don't care for, but, ah, as far as me, ah, you know, I -- I don't tend to -- to do all that.
L:  Yeah.  Um, when you see the commercials on TV for new movies --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, do any of them look exciting to you?
R:  Yeah, actually, um, there's a couple that I'd like to see right now.  Um, [LIPSMACK] wouldn't you know, I can't really think of any.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, the one, ah, um, I just saw a commercial for looked good is, um, -- The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, with Sean Connery.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Um --
R:  Well, you know that'd be good.
L:  Yeah.  It's supposed to place in the Victorian age --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, it's a group of, um -- um, contemporary characters, um, like Alan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, um, Dorien Gray.  Um, they all get together and team up on a secret mission.  
R:  Oh, that sounds great.
L:  Yeah, it does, espec- --
R:  And I like stuff that's -- that's set, you know, historical.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I tend to -- I tend to go for stuff like that a whole lot more than I would just, um --
L:  Well, especially with Connery, well [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  That man just doesn't -- I don't think he's ever had a bad looking day in his life.
R:  Oh, I don't think so either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's a -- he's [LAUGH] -- he's hot, isn't he.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know, and he's bald as a ... bat too, in real life.
R:  Ye- -- well, that's okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What about, did you see the, um, first Terminator movie?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Um, did you see the second one?
R:  I think so.
L:  Ah, that's where --
R:  And there's a third one coming up?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I seen them -- I seen them, and -- and I'd -- would like to see the next one, because I am an Arnold fan.
L:  Oh, I am too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think I've seen everything he's been in.
R:  Me too.  Me too.  I -- and -- and, you know, I just -- I despise these people that make fun of him.  It's usually men.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I love, um, I mean, I actually got a kick out of that one movie that he did that, um, ah, didn't do all that well at the box office, but I liked it.  It was where he teams up with a little kid.
R:  Yes, I loved that movie.
L:  Yeah, Last Wa- --
R:  I thought it was --
L:  -- Last Action Hero.
R:  Yeah.  I thought it was very good.
L:  I did too.  I don't know why it didn't do that great at the box office, but I -- I like him when he plays, um, a comedic side to himself.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I liked, ah, Kindergarten Cop.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, so that was a cute.  I felt so bad for him, because he said he was trying to remember -- um, seeing him doing an interview one time, a long time, you know, um, around that time when he was making, um, ah, Last Action Hero, and, ah, he said that, you know, 'cause his kids were getting older and he wanted to make more -- a movie that the family could go see --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, that he could take his kids to and not have to count the number of times, you know, somebody's been killed [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and, um, you know, it was like -- I -- I don't know, I -- I just bless his heart he was trying to make those kind of movies and nobody was like really --
R:  Yeah, people expect him to be, um --
L:  The Terminator.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  The Terminator.
R:  That's what he's -- that's what he's -- he's supposed to do.
L:  Yeah.  But, yeah, I'd like to -- I haven't heard a whole lot about the third one, um --
R:  I saw previews of it, I think, yesterday, ah, I think it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and it looked pretty good.  And that's the first I had seen actually.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I remembered, um, reading a, um -- I'm like way into movies, so [LAUGH] I remember, ah, when they were first talking about making it, ah -- what was her name that played, um, oh, the female in the first two.  And then she was, um, Beauty and the Beast on TV for, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they had that series.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, gosh.
L:  Um ... ah, she was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- also married to James Cameron, um, Linda Hamilton.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  She played Sarah Connor.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, I remember, um, reading when -- when they were talking about doing T Three, Terminator Three, um, whether or not she'd be in it, and she'd just gone through a kind of a messy divorce with this, um -- um, Cameron, um, he's a director who -- she met him in -- in the first Terminator --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- some juicy gossip for you.  He's married, um, Gifford Horse marries her, and then while he's filming, um, Titanic, the female, um, the grand daughter of the old Rose --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I can't remember her name.  Well, anyway, he divorces, ah, Linda Hamilton to marry her.  [LAUGH] And so, when, ah, they were making Terminator Three, she's like, you know, "I'd come back only if, ah, Cameron was, um, going to direct it"  --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which surprised the hell out of me, 'cause they'd just gone through a nasty divorce.  That's how much her -- another juicy little bit of gossip.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't listen to a hell of a lot of that.  I have, um -- I -- I stay so busy, and I have grandchildren, so I don't get to hear it, and usually my husband will watch the news and he'll tell me stuff, and I'm like, "God, really?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I'm always the last to know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, I do a couple, um -- um, I'm a web designer, and I do a couple of websites for, um -- um, a couple of like fan sites for actors, and, um, so as a rule, I usually spend about thirty minutes to an hour first thing in the morning going through various film sites, ah --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Ah, yeah.  It's kinda, you know, like Hollywood Reporter and Variety and stuff like that, and just kinda --
R:  And you -- you get to work at home?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  Yeah, I love that.
R:  Yeah, I've just been a -- I was in an accident and now I'm going to have to have surgery.  I've been out of work for several months and I'm --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I'm going to have to be out of m- -- of work for a couple more months, and I've been trying to find anything, you know, that I could do at home.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  And, ah --
L:  -- how about e bay.
R:  Um, I've had a couple -- I've had a couple of thoughts about that.  I've not actually, you know, really looked into it, but I tell them that the -- you know, the biggest problem with me is that, um, I have, you know, doctors appointments every day, sometimes two or three, so [LAUGH] --
L:  See, that's the nice thing though about, um -- um, if you have a computer and -- and selling stuff on e bay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I'm talking like yard sale stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I had, um, cleaned out, um, ah -- did like spring cleaning, and rather than have a yard sale, I just, um, took pictures or scanned, um, pictures of the stuff and put it up on e bay and, um, made a couple of hundred bucks just --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Well, that's -- I heard people say that they can do that.
L:  Yeah, it's amazing what, um -- there was one item, I know we're drifting off the topic, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there was one item about a month ago, um, a woman, um, I guess, ah, her mother in law passed away and her and her husband were going through her stuff and, you know, decided what they were going to keep and what they didn't want to keep they put on auction on e bay, and, um, you say you're a grandmother, but you sound like a very, very young grandmother --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, have you ever heard of anything called, um, carnival glass?
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  Okay, well, I never have.  But, when I asked my mother about it, she was like, "Oh, yeah, you know".
R:  I have a couple of pieces, um, that, um, actually, my husband's late grandmother gave us when we got married.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ah, and I love it.  And I'm a -- I'm a big glass collector, so --
L:  Well, you will -- are -- are you sitting comfortably down?  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no. 
L:  [LAUGH] There was -- anyway, this woman had one piece of carnival glass, um, it was like a bowl or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, she put it up for bid and, um -- I'm going to ebay right now to see if I can find it.  It -- it eventually sold, I think it was twenty six thousand dollars --
R:  [MN] Oh, my god.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  She had no idea it was such a -- let me see if I can -- if it's still in there, um ... it was so funny to read the auction, um, because, like, she put it up there for something like four dollars and ninety nine cents, um, as a starting price --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and it just started -- people were bidding.  Apparently it was like one of four known pieces left.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And, um --
R:  Well, I definitely need to [inaudible]
L:  Oh, I know --
