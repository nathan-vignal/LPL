L:  [NOISE]  Hi, --
R:  Hello?
L:  -- I'm Wendy Rocket.
R:  [MN]  Hi, Wendy Rocket, I'm Darryl.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Hi, there.  Well, do you want to start?
R:  [SIGH]  Why don't you start, Wendy Rocket.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.  U- u- um, my opinion is that there -- [SIGH] there's room for some improvement in public schools but, for the most part, I think they're doing a pretty g- good job.  [SIGH]  I think, um, [SIGH] where ... it needs to start is in the h- home, [SIGH] where parents are, educating their kids more or, you know, [SIGH] making them read more.  [SIGH]  That would certainly help.  [LIPSMACK]  And starting them o- off a- at an early age [SIGH] trying to educate them, that always helps.  [SIGH]  So, I think it needs to start there.  [SIGH]  And once they get to school then, you know, they'll [NOISE] be prepared -- better prepared [SIGH] a- a- and, ah, [LIPSMACK] -- a- and from there the public school system, I think they'll have an easier time ... educating the students.  What do you think?
R:  [SIGH]  How can you educate students when there isn't a common l- language that they use?  [SIGH]  We're sticking ... s- students in a class with different l- levels of education --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and English abilities.  [SIGH]  We have non speaking --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- non English speaking s- students in our schools [SIGH] where the teachers are +taking -- taking up more of their time to educate them, [SIGH] [NOISE] and l- losing time on ... t- the children who actually do want to learn.  [SIGH]  I believe that [SIGH] we should stop bussing students in from other districts into s- schools [SIGH] and we should have a degree of testing [SIGH] to allow students to actually pass.  [SIGH]  Yes, there is a pass fail rule in effect, [SIGH] but it's not u- upstanding and people graduate without --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- learning a damn thing.
L:  [LAUGH]  I a- agree but, um, [SIGH] I think that the case in which ... students who aren't English speakers [SIGH] is more of a minority and it's -- and it's more of an issue in states, like -- in south western states where there are a lot of Spanish speakers.  [SIGH]  But [SIGH] I know that they do offer programs, English as a second language, [SIGH] in public schools today.  The public school I went to, [SIGH] um, it was in EL paso, Texas, which is right along the bor- -- the US Mexico border so we had d- definitely [SIGH] a large share of Spanish speakers and, um, they put them in this English as a second language program so that it didn't, ah, int- interfere with the [SIGH] knowledge or learning of the, um, English speakers in the classes.  So, [MN] they were --
R:  Were they in the same grade --
L:  -- separated.
R:  -- as you, though?
L:  Um, they -- they were in the same grade but they were in the English --
R:  Did they participate ... i- in the same classes that you did?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, no, they were in this ESL program which, ah -- [SIGH] which they stay in until their, um, English speaking abilities were up to par so that they could participate with the, um, [SIGH] students in the regular classrooms.
R:  So, once their English speaking --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a- a- ah -- once the -- once their language was up to par [SIGH] was their education also up to the same par as what you had?
L:  [NOISE]  Well, that's all relative, you can't e- expect that every student is at the same education level.  But, um, ... in terms of them being able to participate in --
R:  Why can't you expect that everybody would be at the same education level?
L:  Because --
R:  [SIGH]  We all take the same tests don't we?  [MN]
L:  Mm, but that doesn't matter because, um, [MN] there's ... s- some things that some people can learn more easily than others.  U- u- um, I happen to be able to [SIGH] -- happen to -- happen to be a- able to l- learn more easily math, whereas in -- other people are better at English and that sort of thing and math -- it seems math is tough for many, many, many students but I'm fortunate enough [SIGH] to, um, f- for it to be ... easier for me to pick up on math.  [SIGH]  But in my high school, ah, my e- experience was that ... math was a huge problem for, ah, people and we used to have to take what they call a t- task test.  [SIGH]  Um, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I would always hear of people passing every portion but the math portion [SIGH] which, a- ah, I was quite surprised about because I would just breeze through the math portion, it was very easy for me.  [SIGH]  So, my point is being [SIGH] is that, [SIGH] yes, we all take the same classes but nev- -- not everyone gets the same thing out of ... the class.  So, you can't --
R:  Well, I never said --
L:  -- expect them to be --
R:  -- everybody should get the same thing but everybody should have a standard what they uphold to.  [SIGH]
L:  Hows -- how do you mean?
R:  Well, there should be a minimum standard w- which is set for people to pass a class and that standard is not set and is not enforced.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, I -- in my experience it was always enforced.  W- we -- I mean the standard is ... they -- the teachers grade, supposedly, all the papers ... a- all, ah, equally [SIGH] with the -- with the equal standards applied.  [SIGH]  Therefore, [SIGH] when you get your grades at the end of the semester they average them together, according to their scale, and t- that -- the grade that get is based on [NOISE] ... the grade you made throughout the -- throughout the school year.  [SIGH]
R:  Then how do you explain people --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- graduating without learning to read?
L:  That's a -- that's a good question.  I -- I'm not quite sure.  There are obviously, um, -- are teachers that probably they've had these students in their classes maybe m- [LAUGH] more than once or twice, [SIGH] therefore, they're tired of 'em so they just pass them [SIGH] so that they can, um, move on to the next level because they don't want them back in their class.  Th- that would be my suggestion or, perhaps, [SIGH] -- it depends, when parents complain, you know, they can get their students pushed along to the next grade, even though the student isn't prepared.  [SIGH]
R:  Now, do you believe this happens more in p- public schools or in private schools?  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, definitely more in public school.
R:  And why so?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, because private schools parents pay for the education of the student, [SIGH] therefore, there's more incentive to, um, to participate.  In public schools you're forced to go and many students don't want to be there ... and the parents, you know, they don't -- s- since it's not their money that's paying for their child's education [SIGH] they're taking less of a role in ensuring that their children are getting educated [SIGH] whereas the private, ah, -- the parents of the private school kids, [SIGH] they're going to make sure that their -- their kids are getting educated because they're paying for the ... students' education so they want the +child -- the -- the child to get something out of it.  It's obviously imp- -- [SIGH] more important to them.
R:  So, you're saying private schools are better than the public schools?
L:  No.  [SIGH]  Um, I just don't think it -- it depend- -- it depends on the kid.  It depends on wh- -- [SIGH] if the kid wants to be there and what they want to get out of it.  [SIGH]  I don't ... know if I would've gotten -- I don't necessarily think I would've gotten a better education having gone to a private school than a public school.  But that's because I was motivated [SIGH] 'cause I wanted to learn.  [SIGH]  But I know that there are plenty of other students who are just forced to go there.  [SIGH]  So, yes, I think they -- those students would have +benefitted -- benefitted from -- a private school education.  [SIGH]
R:  Now, you say you're motivated and you want to learn.  [SIGH]  Are you currently in school right now?
L:  Yes.
R:  And how are you doing in school right now?
L:  [MN]  Um, I'm doing pretty g- -- p- pretty well I'm in college right now, though, which is a l- lot different situation than public school.  [SIGH]  Right now I'm paying for my own education so [SIGH] t- there's a lot more motivation there, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  All right.  So, you're saying you're [NOISE] not going to miss a class even though you're on your own [SIGH] like you would've if you went to a public school?
L:  A- ah -- um, that is definitely not true.  [SIGH]  I have certainly missed a class or two [SIGH] or three.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  But, u- u- um, [SIGH] in public school, I mean ... well, of course, you can ditch and stuff but they enforce the rules.  I remember one time I, [SIGH] -- ah, I ditched a class and my mother got a ... c- call from the police so t- that was pretty disturbing to her.  So, [SIGH] you know, they -- they expect that when you get off and you're going to pay -- when you go to college and you're paying for your education that, [LIPSMACK] you know, you're going to personally motivate yourself.  [SIGH]  They don't force you to go there.
R:  [SIGH]  Okay, then let me ask --
L:  It's a different --
R:  -- you a qu- --
L:  -- situation.  [SIGH]
R:  No, let me ask you a question.  Let's say you're in public school [SIGH] and you have an assignment that you have to have done.  [MN]  U- um, you kind of waited until the last minute to do it a- a- and s- something went wrong and you did not finish this.  [SIGH]  Would you go into school the next day and turn in that paper, [MN] or would you go that day to turn in the paper even though there was some kind of failure with it, [SIGH] or would you miss the school because you are not paying for it?
L:  [NOISE]  U- u- um, in public school, um, I -- I would just go -- usually I think [SIGH] well, [SIGH] in t- [LAUGH] that situation in public school I, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] -- I would've either gone in the next day and talked to the teacher [SIGH] or, um, [LIPSMACK] -- or just probably tried to slip it in her pile without h- her noticing.  I know I've t- tried that a couple of times and it's actually [LAUGH] p- proved to work so, [SIGH] ah, um, [MN] you know, that's what I would have done.
R:  [MN]  Okay, I notice now that in most private schools they offer some kind of dress code [SIGH] do you think a public school should +enforce -- enforce a dress code [SIGH] or do you think they should let these fourteen year old girls wear their crop tops [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with their gigantic breasts -- man, fourteen year old girls have big breasts these days, hanging out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and these cutoff shorts?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Or do you think there should be a strict breast -- dress code ... e- enforced?
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, w- [LAUGH] why are you looking is what I might ask but, um, no I don't believe in a dress code [SIGH] in schools.  I k- [LAUGH] know I wore -- I -- when I was in p- public school [SIGH] -- in high school [SIGH] I got pulled aside by a teacher on the last day of class who told me, [SIGH] you know you're not going to be able to wear these s- same things next year, [SIGH] they're gonna enforce some kind of dress code.  But, [SIGH] [MN] u- um, it's not a way that -- the way a person dr- --
