L:  Ah, good evening, my name is May.
R:  Hi, I'm Kathy.
L:  Um, do you live in U- -- the United States?
R:  Yes I do.  I live in Virginia.
L:  Okay, I live in Canada, but we still have, um, probably similar issues about, um, schools anyhow.
R:  Right, I'm sure we do.  I know there's a lot of -- seems like a lot of violence today in schools, like going through metal detectors and stuff.  There's a lot more to be afraid of and I have a -- I would think that that would have an influence on their education, if they're afraid in school, you know?
L:  Right, um, I thought -- I -- I don't have any children myself but -- and I'm not a teacher either but I find, um, [LIPSMACK] the students, ah, the caliber of the students, um, in Canada very poor.  The, um --
R:  You mean as far as their, ah, aca-
L:  Academic standing and h- -- whether they can read or write, or, um, understand.
R:  Hm, well, um, children 'round here are, you know, I think, bright, but I just think that the schools themselves, for some reason, seem to be, I don't know, more ch- -- just more violent and I think they try and make the children grow up a lot faster, and then they wonder why they're, you know, not acting their age when, um -- my son's in kindergarten and it seems like they want him to do stuff I was doing in third grade when I was in school, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I think it's a lot with growing up quicker nowadays.  It seems like su- --
L:  Well, there seems to be a lot more, um, challenges.  Ah, um, did your son go to like nursery school, junior kindergarten, senior kindergarten, then grade one?
R:  Yeah, he went to pre school before he -- he went to kindergarten.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, that kind of prepared him and all, but, you know, it just seems like if they would just want you to do a lot more.  I remember, I went to kindergarten when I was in school and it wasn't that academically challenge.  It was more get socially -- getting to know one another, you know, so, I think they expect a lot more out of 'em nowadays.
L:  I think they do.  Um, one of my, ah, friends, their child is going into, um, senior kindergarten at a Montessori school, which is like a private, ah, I -- do you have Montessori schools in, um, Virginia?
R:  I imagine we do, yeah.
L:  Okay, um, like, he -- sh- -- the mother said that, um, at the end of, ah, junior kindergarten, senior kindergarten, he should be able to read and write --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and already he can count in French and, um, you know, that's quite a bit for a little child who hasn't even gone to grade one yet.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I know my son knows how to, you know, count and he knows how to read and write, they have, um, you know -- they used to make -- write a sentence every day in -- in class and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you know, it just seems like a lot.  I mean, we didn't start reading 'til first grade and here he is in kindergarten --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, and I know --
L:  This is a public school or private school.
R:  It's public, mhm.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mm, yeah, it's -- it's a good school but, you know, they, you know, rely on their, you know, standards of learning that the teachers have to teach.  It's not like, you know, that they have to, ah --
L:  What is the class size for your child's, um --
R:  Um, I think there's, like, twenty three kids in the class.
L:  That's not a bad size.
R:  No, no, and they have a teacher and a teacher's helper, so --
L:  Oh, that's quite good.
R:  Yeah, so, yeah, that is good, but they still expect a lot, I think, you know.
L:  So, um, are you saying that like in high schools, some high schools have metal detectors?
R:  Um, not -- I don't know in Virginia, but I know in different, um, like in inner cities and stuff they do.  I mean --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, for --
L:  Probably for a reason.
R:  Oh yeah, I'm sure -- I'm sure that is, but still, I mean, wouldn't you want -- you know, somebody brings a gun or a knife to school, you know, I would think they'd be a trouble maker anyway, they should just not be allowed in school or something, or -- or a different school, you know, I don't --
L:  But in Toronto, um, I had read in the paper that a grade two, maybe it wasn't in Toronto, maybe it was in somewhere in North America, who knows, um, a child was suspended from school for bringing a knife to cut his bagel --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- with his lunch.  You know, I mean I think that goes a little bit too far also.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, yeah, I heard on the radio one -- one day driving home about like a kindergarten or a first grader, I don't know, they were still in grade school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, ah, was playing guns or whatever, just with his hands and went "Bang bang" or something and they expelled him or suspended him because they -- their school adopted a zero tolerance, um, stance as far as, ah, weapons in school and, you know, some people just take the ball and run too far with it and that's a -- that's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- an example.  There's no, ah, happy medium as far as that goes, so, huh.
L:  Right, um, in, um, Virginia, when does, ah, class, um, start, like in September or in August?
R:  Um, I think this past year it started in August.  Well, I forget, 'cause my son just started kindergarten, that's my first experience with school --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but it -- it depends on the county you're in, really, 'cause some schools start before, um, La- --
L:  Labor Day.
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- some after, so, I think our county started after Labor Day this -- this past year.
L:  Well, that was very civilized.  Um, [LIPSMACK] when does -- when did, ah, school end?
R:  It ended on, um, Friday the thirteenth --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for -- for Shenandoah County but I know, um, other counties ended, you know, sooner and l- -- end later, so it really depends on the county you're in.
L:  Oh, I see, because I think today was the last day for the teachers, and I think Wednesday was the last day for the students.
R:  Oh my goodness, really, that's a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a long time, ha.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  But here, you know, we have snow days so it's all dependent, you know, some counties make up, ah, snow days and so forth, so they might add three days on to the end of the year to make up --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for snow days, you know, in this past year we seem to have had a lot after that, ah, we had, you know, blizzard --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, ah, schools were --
L:  Um, although we -- we live in Toronto, we get ver- -- ah, we very seldom have snow days --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, we don't have snow days.
R:  You don't have snow days?
L:  No.  We, um -- well, I think part -- part of the reason we don't have snow days is because you, ah, most of the people in Toronto, both parents work, so if there's a snow day then, um, the, ah, parents' baby sitting service is not available, so, I mean, um, you know, who's going to take care of the child --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so they just -- yeah, we -- we don't close schools.
R:  Mhm, and plus you have snow all the time I assume, [LAUGH] so, it's a -- ah, just an every day thing for you, is it?
L:  No, not really.
R:  No, no?
L:  No.
R:  You don't have snow all the time?
L:  No, not all the time --
R:  No.
L:  -- no, Buffalo, New York has lot's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but we're on the other side of the lake so we do -- do not get that much snow.
R:  Hm.
L:  Well.  Have you ever been to Canada?
R:  I went to Vancouver, but it was just a day trip, so that's on the other end of the --
L:  You live in Virginia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  It was a day trip.  I was in, ah, Washington State for --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- work, yeah, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we -- we went up there for the day and, um, had lunch and did a little shopping and then, ah, went back [LAUGH] to [MN] --
L:  Fair enough.  That's -- that -- that truly is a day trip.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we were in Washing- -- you know, Washington State so it was in driving distance.  It's really pretty up there.
L:  Right.
R:  A lot of people were into, ah, fresh cut flowers and stuff and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um [MN], yeah.
L:  Did you have a heat wave the past couple of days, or you've had a hot summer or what?
R:  Ah, yeah, for the last few days it's been really hot.
L:  Right.
R:  Compared to before where it seemed like one day it would be kind of hot and the next day would be cold.  I mean, I honestly still have my winter stuff, um, up in my closet because it's been like -- it'd be fifty degrees one day.
L:  That's kind of cold.
R:  Yeah.  Um, ah, was about two weeks ago, maybe, and that's really odd for, you know, being that cold in June.
L:  Right.
R:  Usually you're used to it being, you know, sweltering, but, um, you know, it's hard to -- it was a weird summer start, I tell you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah, we had like really sweltering h- -- um, heat and yesterday we -- we expected thunderstorms but it just blew over and it -- now it's nice, dry and cool.
R:  Yeah, it's cooler here now too, so, I guess it's, um --
L:  Are you --
R:  -- all o- --
L:  -- subject to, um, like, um, tornadoes or, um, hurricanes, or are you too far inland.
R:  No, hur- hurricanes.  No, we're not too far inland.  Hurricanes, yes, tornadoes, um, like there's been, like, some touch down and everything but they don't, ah, they're not prominent, it's not like the mid west or anything.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, yeah, we can -- we can get h- hit by hurricanes.
L:  Oh, that can be, um, very fearful.
R:  Mm, yeah, but, um, I don't remember the last storm, so we've been pretty lucky so far.  We're about, ah, sixty miles west of DC, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- yeah, so, that's not -- not too far, but I imagine they would get it worse.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  
R:  Yeah, hm.
L:  Have you done this Fisher, um, study before or --
