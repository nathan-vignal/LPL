L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Gail.
R:  Hi, I'm Jean in Boston.
L:  I'm in New Jersey.
R:  Are we the only two?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Okay.
L:  I think so.  Uh, uh, what do we talk about?  I don't know.  Have you done it -- have you done this yet?
R:  Yeah, th- I done one before about smoking.
L:  Oh, you did.
R:  Uh, they -- they didn't give you the little recording with the topic?
L:  Well, yeah, I mean they told me the topic but I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- uh, do you just start talking or ...?
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's really weird.  You just --
L:  It is weird.
R:  -- start talking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And is there something seriously wrong with the US public -- after the first time I -- I knew to jot it down.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Is there something seriously wrong with the US public school system?  Is the topic.
L:  Y- yeah.  Uh, well, I -- I think so but I -- I can't p- pinpoint anything particular just, uh, I think that the teachers need to be more involved.
R:  More involved with what?
L:  With -- with the students, with their lives.  Not just think that at three oclock they go home and they shouldn't think about them anymore.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  My, um -- my mother and my sister are -- well, my mother's retired but -- and my sister is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a teacher and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- to me [MN] having, you know, grown up in a family with a teacher its' like -- it consumes their whole +lives.
L:  Really?
R:  I mean, I've got -- yeah, because, you know, [MN] when you've got a regular job, when you go home the job's over.  But when you're a teacher you have to take it home with you because you can't do any of the stuff --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- that you need to do --
L:  That is true.
R:  -- at school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because you don't have -- like I work in an office so, you know, to do your paperwork so I've got a memory always of my mother, she was grading papers or writing out -- I mean, she taught special ed so she had to write out the -- the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- IEPs --
L:  Oh, like assessments?
R:  -- the individual -- well, no, individual education plans for the --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- special ed students.
L:  Okay.
R:  And you can't -- you can't do any of that when you're teaching.
L:  That's true.
R:  So, I don't think that people who don't live with teachers realize.  You know, they say, "Oh, they get the summer off.  They get home at three oclock".
L:  Well, that's --
R:  And --
L:  -- yes, I have no teachers in my family.
R:  But, you know, I would -- I remember my mother, you know, we were sitting there and we'd be watching the evening news --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she'd be grading papers or my sister would be, you know, making posters and stuff 'cause all the work for the -- it's like being on stage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All the work that they do in the classroom and for the classroom, their lesson plans, they do at home.
L:  True.
R:  And people don't, you know, they don't realize that.  Y- you can't just walk into a classroom and start teaching.
L:  No, of course not.
R:  You've gotta -- you've gotta prepare your lesson plans and the materials and all that.  And, you know, th- I don't think people realize.  I -- I've got one kid in public schools so far.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My oldest and how much teachers spend on that s- -- on all the stuff.
L:  Oh, I -- I do know that because I used to work in a religious school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I remember the teachers just having to put every penny out of their pockets --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just to -- to get anything done.
R:  It's a -- well, it's really -- it's the same I guess in public schools.  I mean, I'm in a pretty affluent district but I saw the difference between my daughter's teacher, who'd been teaching probably for twenty years, and then a brand new teacher started next door and her room was just bare.
L:  [MN]
R:  This -- this poor new teacher because all the interesting stuff, the teachers pretty much --
L:  Bring themselves.
R:  -- bring themselves like my daughter's teacher had a -- a special carpet for circle time and pillows and then the special child's armchair and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all the funky posters and things.  They don't really get a really big budget to go --
L:   No, not at all.
R:  -- out and buy all the stuff.  I mean, they get a budget for pencil and papers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they're lucky but all the fun stuff, they pretty much, you know, the class buys for them or --
L:  Yeah, no, I know --
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  I do know that.  You're right.
R:  So, I don't know, I think it's awfully a broad topic too, I mean --
L:  It is.  I mean --
R:  -- you can't say ...
L:  I mean there's problems with of course, like you said, there's a problem there that the teachers aren't getting enough money to do what they need to do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  But I don't know how you can -- I d- I don't think I'd agree that there's something seriously wrong with the entire system because the system is made up of individual schools and individual --
L:  Which is true.  I guess --
R:  -- districts.
L:  -- I'm going by my own experience.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I -- it wasn't so much my teachers.  I actually had a wonderful teacher.  It was more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the administration, the -- the principals and -- and, uh, vice principals that weren't doing things that needed to be done.
R:  Oh.
L:  To take care of my education in the [MN] -- I was in an instance where they passed me for my junior year of high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I should not have passed.
R:  Oh.
L:  I had no classes by the end of the year.  I had cut so much.  They kicked me out of all my classes and they still passed me simply because they wanted me out of their hair.
R:  But don't they h- -- didn't they have rules about, you know?
L:  I -- I really don't know how it happened.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um --
R:  That's terrible.
L:  -- I did in my senior year end up taking a couple of, um, junior classes also at the same time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But [MN] I still should not have been sent to the next grade.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, I feel that they -- not so much the teachers as you said, because the teachers really -- what -- what can they do when the student's not showing up to class.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the administration should have s- [MN] stuck by their rules more.
R:  Well, when you cut -- well, the -- I guess that is part of like the system, I mean, when they cut class I thought there were, um, you know, what do you call truant officers and stuff, who would track down and see if there was anything wrong with the child or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, why they were missing and ...
L:  See, they never -- they never really did that with me.
R:  Wow.
L:  And they should have. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and now --
R:  Because, you know --
L:  -- I know that.
R:  -- where -- where, well, you didn't, you know, hen you're a kid, you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that.  You think, "Oh, they're just out to get you" but --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, where -- where -- where are the kids?  I mean, they could be -- if they're not in school, they could be in danger or --
L:  I mean, yeah, luckily --
R:  -- getting into trouble or ...
L:  -- [MN] I was, you know -- [MN] I was a fairly good kid except for the cutting class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so all I was doing was sitting around with friends.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  You know, at Dunking Donuts.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I mean [LAUGH] you know, there's -- there's other kids out there that can be, you know, in gangs and -- and --
R:  In trouble.
L:  A lot of trouble.
R:  So ...
L:  And I w- I -- that's my problem [NOISE] with the school system is that I feel that they [NOISE] -- they're not paying attention.
R:  Oh, do you hear a voice --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- saying, "Hello"?
L:  -- that's m- that's my stupid --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- phone.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, that's okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  And sometimes I guess they have people kind of jump -- jump in to the --
L:  Oh, do they?
R:  -- the c- -- I don't know.  I -- this is only my second one but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it -- I -- I always get -- I got the idea that there was supposed to be [MN] more than -- more than one person but the other one was like that too.  It was just one person.
L:  Oh, I always thought --
R:  So, we just --
L:  -- it was one person.
R:  Well, I don't -- 
L:  That's weird.
R:  -- I don't know.  It's, er, mysterious to me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I mean I -- I think that the idea of the public schools is great because, you know, and just the -- the idea of having free public education it's --
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- it's a w- it's a wonderful thing.  Um, rereading a book from ages and ages ago.  A tree -- oh, tr- -- it's called, "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn".  I don't know if you ever heard of it but um ...
L:  No.
R:  It's about an immigrant family and, uh, the mother when she came over, the oldest girl didn't even go to school because the mother didn't realize that in this country, you know, public education is free.
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  Because she was from, I don't know, Austria or so- -- I mean this is in the turn of the century.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, or the turn of the last century.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  You know, nineteen -- nineteen twelve or whatever but, uh, I mean the -- the concept is great but, um, yeah, I mean definitely in the execution there's probably problems but I don't -- I don't know that I think there's a serious problem.  I think in a case by case basis.
L:  Yeah, [MN] a- as I said, you know, I'm going by my own experience --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so it's kinda like it's --
R:  Well, that's all you have to go to.
L:  But to go, you know -- generally the schools a- are, you know -- as -- as much as I had problems, I did learn what I needed to learn.
R:  Well, that's good.  [MN]
L:  You know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and -- and I guess they did something right.
R:  And they rescued you in the end.
L:  I -- yes, absolutely did.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And did they -- did you get to go on to more education or ...?
L:  Yes, I did.  I ended up going to college.  I'm in college now.
R:  Oh, good for you.
L:  Yeah, thank you.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's wonderful.
L:  Yeah, and -- and actually, er, my senior year was completely different.  [LAUGH] I was straight A.'s.  On a roll.
R:  Oh, you must have --
L:  It just, you know, but ...
R:  -- caught up -- caught up.
L:  Yes.
R:  Caught your attention. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- it's -- it's probably, you know, har- harder to have a -- a perspective of the system when you just have the perspective of the student because now as a parent I've --
L:  Yeah, I see.
R:  -- got a -- a different perspective too.  And also the perspective of paying for it because [MN] like in my town we just had a -- a override to our budget that failed because a lot of people didn't wanna increase the taxes so they've had to cut three million dollars from the school budget which is --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- really bad.  Like my -- my daughter's crying because her gym teacher said, "You know, goodbye -- I -- they fired me because too many people voted no". and --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- so they had to cut the gym and the art and the music from an hour --
L:  See, that's horrible.
R:  -- an hour to forty five minutes and ...
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's terrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a problem with the school -- well, that's not the school system itself but --
R:  Yeah, that's it --
L:  -- you know, that they -- they cut them so much because [MN] [MN] how are we going to get our future president if they're not going to be taught?
R:  Yeah, but, you know, I mean I can understand -- not that I agree with it but I can understand the perspective of the people who voted against it because they're saying, "You know --"
L:  More money.
R:  "-- so many people have lost their jobs and --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and people are hurting and why should there be more taxes and it was good enough for me to have fifty kids in the classroom, why isn't it, you know, good enough for kids these days.  Why can't --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- they get by --"
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  "-- with, uh, what we got by with" but ...
L:  Yeah, but i- it's different now.
R:  Yeah, because --
L:  It's very different even from when I was at high school which was only ten years ago.
R:  The world is -- is more complicated and there's more things that you have to learn and be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ready for and you have to -- you have to have computers and y- you know, you c- you can't graduate from high school and --
L:  No, you can't --
R:  -- [MN] not have --
L:  -- you can't have a job out of high school.
R:  And not -- yeah, you gotta be prepared to go to college or at least to go into a trade --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or something so it's not right but it's, uh -- it's expensive when you're -- you're sitting there and you're writing your tax bill out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's not -- it's not -- it's not free.  [SIGH]
L:  No, it's not free but --
R:  [LAUGH] But, uh --
L:  -- if you think of the -- the price of private schools --
R:  Oh, it's --
L:  -- i- it's --
R:  -- tremendously.
L:  Oh.
