L:  [NOISE]
R:  Angie Randolph.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  B- Brad Winnow.  [NOISE]
R:  So, do you think there's a problem with it?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  With the public school systems?
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Um, yeah, I do t- [LAUGH] think there are some problems with it.
R:  [SIGH]  Do you have children in school?  [SIGH]
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  I do and there's definitely a problem.  [SIGH]  [MN]  There's not enough teachers and t- then the teachers that are there that [SIGH] are not paid enough and their bitter about it, and they're just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- generally hateful.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, ah, I don't think teachers s- should -- I mean [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you don't become --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a teacher f- for the money.  I --
R:  [SIGH]  Well, no, but I mean they should get paid more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than what they do.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Well, I think starting out one of the big things -- 'cause I have a couple of friends that are, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, [NOISE] teachers and --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- s- starting out --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] I think they need, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- ah, maybe not necessarily more pay but, [SIGH] um, they tend to buy a lot of supplies [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and in the beginning it affects them more because, you know, -- a -- they have to buy all their supplies [NOISE] and some of the supplies like, you know, scissors and things like that you can use year to year.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But, ah, I think they should maybe get a stipend for that.  But I think a lot of people also t- think that [NOISE] -- that the answer is just p- putting more money into schools.  And I -- I live in Minnesota, I don't know where you live [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  I live in Tennessee.
L:  Oh, okay, but in [NOISE] -- in Minnesota, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, we -- we just had Jesse Ventura as governor.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, under h- his administration [NOISE] I mean they put all -- well, they do, ah, budgets on a two year b- basis [SIGH] and I think the first year they put, like, si- ah, first two years they put, like, s- seven and -- seven hundred ... m- million more dollars [NOISE] -- new dollars in.
R:  And it didn't help 'em?
L:  [MN]  And then they came -- [SIGH] they came back with next budget and they put, like, three hundred million more in.  [SIGH]  And [NOISE] ah, t- then he turned around and he said, [NOISE] "Well, I want to see what you guys are doing with this increased money?" and, you know, everybody was, like, "Oh, you can't, you know, o- o- oh, you know, you're attacking teachers".  And [SIGH] I don't think -- the +problem, ah, -- one of the biggest problems I think is people think that, "Oh, if we just give th- them more --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "--they'll do more" and that's not -- that's not the answer either.  [SIGH]
R:  I think they should be evaluated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from year to year.
L:  [NOISE]  Ah --
R:  My son had a teacher last year.  The woman was just absolutely dreadful.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  She c- called the children babies.  [SIGH]  She said they were immature and he's in second -- he was in second grade last year.  [MN]  She said they were babies, that they were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- immature, that they cried like little girls --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and he's a little boy, [SIGH] I mean, she was just dreadful.  [SIGH]  The first three days of school she called me and said, "You ought to, [SIGH] um, think about putting him back in first grade.  He's just not ready for second grade".  And this was after a wh- -- after being out --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a whole summer, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.  And that's t- the first three days she's calling and saying, "You should put him back in first grade".  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And she was just horrible.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, sounds like maybe she did not have --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] and -- and one of the other things that I don't like too is, ah, t- the teachers unions, [SIGH] I mean, it's like once you have -- [NOISE] once you're in -- once you've got seniority, I mean, [SIGH] [MN] you know, it's impossible to get rid of a teacher [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] even if they're doing something.  Ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you hear about these teachers that, [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, they get charged with, you know, like, child molestation --
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and then on paid administrative leave.  W- wait a second.
R:  No, [LAUGH] it don't work that way.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, okay, ah, you know what?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hey, put their pay check in escrow --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and if you're found innocent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] then -- y- you know, guess what, I want to see that -- that, you know, t- t- the kids and the parents that charged you with this, I want to see them in, [SIGH] you know, in jail too because I mean teaching is [SIGH] a thankless job.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, -- [SIGH] you know, just because you upset a kid because you gave him a bad grade or, you know, you disagreed with [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- their opinion doesn't mean you should get charged with ... s- something like that but --
R:  No.
L:  -- [SIGH] but, you know, I mean how can you, ah, -- ah, give a pay check --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to somebody who is, you know, winds up being, you know, hey, like I said, put it in escrow, maybe only give 'em half, the other half is in escrow and, if you're convicted, guess what?
R:  You don't get it at all.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  W- well, they've already given 'em, you know, like I'm saying, like, give 'em half their pay but, [SIGH] you know, p- put a lien against t- their house or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their car.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause that's just wrong I mean -- I -- I mean, yeah, it takes a lot to be a teacher but I mean you shouldn't use it to your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] advantage --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and take advantage of children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean [NOISE] [SIGH] you see it on the news all the time --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and teachers have been convicted of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- molestation and [SIGH] rape and, you know, all that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stuff and then -- a- and like you said they get paid +administrative leave.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just insane.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And --
R:  [SIGH]  It's just insane.
L:  -- and not to mention, [NOISE] like, a lot of these schools, you know, [SIGH] [NOISE] they count, ah, administrators and principals as teachers [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] and they don't teach any classes.  [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  And on top of it, you know, some of these people, you know, principals [NOISE] and -- and [SIGH] if there's one principal, [NOISE] you know, yeah, I -- I think maybe they should get -- earn real big bucks.  But, like, the high school I [NOISE] went to --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] we had [NOISE] -- [SIGH] well we had one principal but we had, like, four assistant principals p- p- plus, you know, I mean, I don't know how may administrators and [SIGH] [NOISE] after a while, I mean it just gets a little ... you know, ridiculous.
R:  Too many people trying to run --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one place.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And -- and on top of that, I mean, when people would say, you know, we need to pay teachers more, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] they need to be paid a -- a decent wage [NOISE] but I mean --
R:  Yeah, a decent wage.  I mean --
L:  -- you know, some of the pe- people, you know, [NOISE] a- a- -- you know, I -- I don't want somebody saying, "Oh, gee [SIGH] teaching --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- is a good career b- because it makes decent mon-" you know, [SIGH] I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they get their, -- you know, quite often they wind up with their health care being, you know, [SIGH] either darn near free or even free which [SIGH] [NOISE] -- I don't ... know what you do but, you know, it's -- it's not cheap.  [SIGH]
R:  N- no, it's not cheap.  [LAUGH]  Ours just went up not l- long ago.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  But I mean i- i- it -- it's like some teachers [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they've been there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for twenty years and they're excellent teachers.  They have a good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- track record, all their kids, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] made really good grades because th- -- and they learn a lot.  [SIGH]  And then you have these other teachers like my son had last year [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he didn't learn a thing and he almost had to repeat second grade --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because she didn't teach him anything.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And she's getting paid as much as --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- the ... teachers who, --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, teach 'em everything else.  That's just not right.  [SIGH]  You know, [SIGH] I -- I do think they should be [SIGH] +evaluated -- evaluated.  [NOISE]  You know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe not every year but, like, every three, four years, you know.  [SIGH]  Just go in and say -- you know, see how you're doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how the class is going.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  And maybe -- and not just one day [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like a week or something because, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] yeah, anybody can be  --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- good for a day.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Well, and -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- among other things, I mean, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] ah, [SIGH] [NOISE] y- y- you know, I mean, ah, -- the -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the thing that -- to solve the problem [NOISE] with, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, the schools I think we also --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- need to get back to [SIGH] I mean, [NOISE] you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- these parents that -- that got kids that, you know, mouth off in class and then they sue the teacher.  [NOISE]  Like, [SIGH] a kid I heard about a couple of years [NOISE] ago was out in [NOISE] Kansas and these [SIGH] kids with [NOISE] caught cheating on their term papers.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum. [NOISE]
L:  And the -- the -- teacher flunked them all [SIGH] and then the school board tells them, "You -- you can't -- you -- you --"
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  "-- you have to give 'em As and Bs so the can --" [SIGH] you know, that's ridiculous.
R:  That's wrong.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's wrong.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah, ah, i- it -- you know, to have a thankless job.  And then [SIGH] some of these students, [SIGH] you know, they get all ... upset.  There was one teacher that said, "I'm going to [NOISE] -- I need an electronic copy of all of y- your [SIGH] ... papers" and he goes, "And I'm going to be checking them against the site on the Internet".
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, you know, t- the kids are protesting.  I'm like, "Wait a second, [NOISE] that -- the fact that the teachers even warning you --"
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  "-- i- i- is amazing to me".  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  And the ... school board's supposed to be there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to back their [NOISE] teachers, --
L:  We --
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, one hundred percent, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, unless --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's, like, a severe case.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know, [SIGH] they're supposed to be there on the teacher's side --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- not the student's side [SIGH] --
L:  Hey, --
R:  -- you know.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I had a fraternity --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- b- brother --
R:  Yes.  [NOISE]
L:  -- that in college there was ... a chemistry course he was taking.  [SIGH]  He set the curve on one of his tests.  He told me he got a sixty eight percent.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I don't mind it when a teacher is super tough, [NOISE] you know.  And I -- and I asked him and I said something and he goes, [SIGH] "No, he goes "The tests were that just tough".  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, you know, ah, eventually I mean the curve kicks in but [SIGH] [NOISE] ah, you know, the -- the point is -- it's, [NOISE] you know, I don't mind if a teacher's kicking everybody's butt on the test --
R:  No.
L:  -- because, you know, you're there to learn.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But for somebody to say, "Oh, you can't do this." because, [SIGH] you know, I -- I see the standards in the public schools being lowered [SIGH] every time we turn around and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's not doing us any favors.
R:  No, it's [NOISE] not.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's not and t- t- the curriculum changes so much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from year to year.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, it [NOISE] --
R:  I mean it's just a- amazing.  I don't know how the teachers k- keep caught up.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's [NOISE] -- it would be very difficult to, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Especially ones who have been there for thirty and f- forty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- years.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  How do they keep [LAUGH] caught up, you know, 'cause, [SIGH] ah, it's just, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Well, I -- yeah, I understand but [SIGH] I mean though, like, history, come on h- how much --
R:  How much is it going to change?
L:  -- catching up do you need to do?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, [SIGH] exactly.
L:  How much more do you need to learn to teach history?  Okay, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, it's been ten --
R:  If it happened yesterday it's history.
L:  -- years, okay, you have to learn about the new Gulf War.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I --
R:  There's not -- I mean l- -- history, no, there's not more you can learn.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But I mean --
L:  Well, in --
R:  -- he's gone through --
L:  -- that's interesting too people are going an- and -- and revising history.  [NOISE]  We got to show [SIGH] [NOISE] o- other, you know, [NOISE] viewpoints of the -- I mean [NOISE] ... you know, I'm not saying we should be [NOISE] [SIGH] saying that, you know, Columbus came to America and discovered, you know, dark [NOISE] -- ah, dark skinned, you know, savages.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But [SIGH] you know, at -- at some point, you know, hey, a- ah, Columbus, ah, -- in -- in college we had to read essays about what a horrible person Columbus was.  [SIGH]  And the point is Columbus did [NOISE] [SIGH] what everyone else did back then.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You did it for glory, you did it for God or you did it for gold.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yep.  [SIGH]
L:  And he was doing all three by undertaking this expedition.  [SIGH]  And, yeah, he did some terrible things but that -- I mean that's what people did [NOISE] to each other.  I mean it's only r- recently that, you know, we've said, [SIGH] "Oh, gee, [NOISE] i- it's w- wrong to do that" --
R:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah.  [SIGH]  And they've --
L:  -- [SIGH] you know.
R:  -- decided that they can't teach -- they won't teach certain subjects in school --
L:  [NOISE]  Well, like --
R:  -- [SIGH] huh, or they have to teach certain --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- subjects in schools.
L:  Oh, yeah!  Huc- Huckleberry Finn, I think it is [SIGH] [NOISE] --
