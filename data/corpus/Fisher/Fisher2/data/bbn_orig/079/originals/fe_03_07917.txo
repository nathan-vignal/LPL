L:  Hello?
R:  H- hi.
L:  [NOISE] Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Shelley.  What's your name?
L:  Susan.
R:  Susan, hey, what's up?
L:  Not much.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, what part of the country are you calling from?
L:  Uh, Louisiana.
R:  Really?  I'm calling from California.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, betcha it's nice over there.
R:  Nah, actually it's too hot right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's hot --
R:  So ...
L:  -- here.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I can imagine too.
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, what do you --
R:  I think --
L:  -- think about that question.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, um [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  Do you wanna answer it first?
L:  [NOISE] I don't know what I would do.  Um ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] A million dollars is an awful lot of money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  I'd, um --
R:  Um ...
L:  [NOISE] It'd be a hard -- I would have to sit and think about it for a while.  [NOISE] At least a day to find out what I would do.  [NOISE]
R:  True.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] just had my best -- I just had my best friend come visit me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um -- like she just left last --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, right now I'm like all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sentimental and, you know, whatever because I -- I really miss her 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I won't be able to see her for like at least a year so ...  I don't know, it's kinda hard just to never talk to your best friend again.  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE] Maybe you could just write?  That wouldn't be talking, right?
R:  Oh, I can't hear you, sorry.
L:  Y- you could write to 'em.  That wouldn't be talking to 'em, right?  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I think they mean you can't communicate with 'em at all.  
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's probably what they mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  It would be a hard decision to make.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Be like between a rock --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- and a hard place.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, well.  This is the kind -- I don't know, I don't like this question that much. Like you can't really have that long of a discussion about it.
L:  No, you can't.  [NOISE] You either answer yes or no and if it's yes, you could say why, and if it's no, you say why, and that's it.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Have you done this before?
L:  Yeah, this is my third phone call.  Third --
R:  It's your third?
L:  -- third -- third call.
R:  Oh, okay.  This is my second.  Did you like your other topics better?
L:  Yeah, the first one was, um, what type of weather do you like?  Cold or hot?
R:  Oh, yeah, that's c- [LAUGH] ...
L:  And then it was -- the second one was something like, [NOISE] er, uh, how d- -- how do you spend your outdoor time, [NOISE] like what kind of activities do you like?
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- and then I had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this one.
R:  -- those are +all -- yeah, those are a lot more open ended.
L:  Yeah.  Usually --
R:  What -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what -- I can't hear you.
L:  Usually you don't have time to say goodbye to the person before they hang up on you.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um ...
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Er, [NOISE] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Say for now, no, because I guess I personally feel like I can still -- I still have time to make my own money.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I guess I'll just --
L:  Well, you sound like you're young?
R:  Well, I'm going to college right now.
L:  [MN] I'm forty so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, well, I'm sure, you know, like, y- you -- do you have your family and everything like all situated ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, see, in a way, that's also very comforting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so ...
L:  [NOISE] I'd probably say, "Well, can I have half of it and still keep my friend?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm sorry.  I didn't -- I didn't hear that at all.
L:  I -- I would probably say, "Well, can I -- can I take half of it and still keep my friend?"  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There you go.  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like compromises.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Or -- or -- or a third of it, you know?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  I don't have to have a whole million dollars 'cause I'm just --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- some of it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would take my friend out.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I don't think it works that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  See, that'd be too easy.
L:  [NOISE] Well, my husband's over here saying, "I'd have to choose my friend".  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do you have a really good best friend that you're thinking of right now.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, [NOISE] I would [NOISE] -- my mom's probably my best [NOISE] friend that I have.
R:  Oh, yeah, you can't -- you know, you can't stop talking to your mom.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] So, [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'd probably have to turn it down.
R:  Mhm, me too.  I don't know.
L:  I'd say -- say, "Oh, well.  If it was meant to be I would have it.  If not, oh well".  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  Like, well, I guess, we've gave them our answers.  I don't know what else they want.
L:  You just have to --
R:  How did you -- huh?
L:  Just talk until the ten minutes is up, I guess. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  H- how did you find out about this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, UPENN experiment thing.
L:  Uh, my mom belongs to it and she gave me the --
R:  What do you mean?
L:  -- the [NOISE] address and everything.  Email address and I signed up for it and haven't got no money from them yet but I've gotten three phone calls.  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just it's -- this is only my second time.  So, do you -- are you actually like getting a check for this thing?
L:  Am I what?  [NOISE]
R:  Are you actually getting the checks?
L:  I don't know.  My mom has.  [NOISE]  So, I -- and I just started about --
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- three weeks ago so ... [NOISE]
R:  Uh, um ...
L:  I guess I have to wait 'til the month is up or something.  [NOISE] I get about --
R:  Hello?
L:  -- I get about one [NOISE] -- one of these a -- a week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... [NOISE]

L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Yep.  [NOISE] What --
R:  So you -- so you're --
L:  -- time is it there?

R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- it -- it was a hundred and twelve degrees in our house --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- yesterday.  So ...
R:  Oh, goodness.
L:  [NOISE] It's just been too hot.  [NOISE]
R:  Wow, that -- h- what's the hottest it's ever gotten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- down there?
L:  Um, temperature wise?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, last year I think it got up to a hundred and eight or a hundred and ten.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Wow.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think Arizona --
L:  And that's not -- that's not including the heat index.  The heat index makes it hotter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But what are --
R:  So, the humidity is pretty bad?
L:  Yes, very bad.
R:  Mm mm.  That's what I imagined.

R:  Mm, so what were you -- what were you trying to study?
L:  Art photography.  [NOISE]
R:  What was it?
L:  Art photography.
R:  Oh, that's really nice.  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  Did you -- so you loved photography I take it.
L:  Yeah, but I got mixed in with the partying group, you know, and just [NOISE] couldn't keep my --
R:  Well, I'm in --
L:  It was just bad so three months is all I had.
R:  It's all right though, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Uh, 'cause a lot of people.  I mean, I know some people myself that didn't go to college and that's, you know, the hardest thing, I'm losing everybody now so ...

L:  [MN] No, I wouldn't wanna do that.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  What would you do with a million dollars?
L:  Pay off all my bills.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Buy me a car, buy me a house.
R:  Uh-huh.
