L:  Hi, I'm Roz.
R:  Hi, I'm Kim.
L:  Hi, nice to talk to you.
R:  I've never done this before.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it's your first call -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- actually it's my second one, so I have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- done this once before.  Fortunately the topic is a little bit better.  Last time it was, ah, baseball strikes and I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- didn't know anything about the topic at all, so, and neither did the person I was talking to so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that was interesting but, so, yeah.  So, I guess the topic today is affirmative action or affirm-, yeah, affirmative action.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's about affirmative action in the -- in the business community.  So, what do you think?
R:  Um, I -- to an extent, I don't think it's right.  I don't think it's fair.  I'll --
L:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, I guess I can kind of understand that.
R:  I know a lot of people that, um, they keep their jobs because of the a- affirmative action and they really don't do the amount of work they're supposed to.
L:  Oh.
R:  And they get away with it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I see.  I guess I can see it more in hiring them, I mean, if it's affecting, like, how, I mean, you're -- how -- how the management would handle you not doing your job well, I think that's definitely not --
R:  Right.  [MN] Well --
L:  -- at all what it was intended to do.
R:  I don't see why a r- -- I -- well, I don't see a reason why they can't, um, [LIPSMACK] -- um, like decide who they're going to hire before finding out what race a person is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, ah, oh, you know, based on their resume it shouldn't make a difference.
L:  Yeah, but on the other hand, I mean, most --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- jobs do job interviews before they decide --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so, if they're -- you know, if there weren't any precautions in place then it would be very simple for, you know, a racist organization to really just say, well, you know, we interviewed them, we didn't like them and, you know, I guess that's the whole idea.  I can see kind of both sides, obviously --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't have a real, ah, strong opinion either way.
R:  Right, I guess they need better guidelines.
L:  Yeah, I think that -- that's a good opi- -- a goo- -- a good point, is, I mean, it would be really nice to know where everybody stands because, you know, I mean, I -- like, honestly I, you know, I'm white, it's not really going to benefit me at all, but on the other hand I can kind of see where, you know, if -- if we don't do affirmative action then what do we do in a lot of cir- -- situations.
R:  Right.
L:  Because, you know, racism really doesn't seem to be going anywhere [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unfortunately.  So, I don't know what -- what, if -- if not affirmative action then what?  But it would be -- you know, it would nice to know exactly w- what people were up against and what the criteria were and, you know, I can kind of see, you know, some rules making more sense than others, you know, quota systems for people who are less qualified get hired, you know, are obviously really a problem, but then that's like, well if you have people who are equals, you have qualifications, should race be a factor in, I don't know, it would be nice [SIGH] if we didn't wo- -- live in a world where it was necessary, but [SIGH] I'm just like, I can see both sides kind of, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it is frustrating, I mean, to see people who really don't deserve to be given --
R:  Well --
L:  -- a hand that, you know -- like are given a step up to -- who do take advantage.
R:  Like, I -- I was -- I was passed over for a job because they wanted a man.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  And that was totally wrong.  It was, ah -- ah, um, because I wasn't a union employee I really couldn't go and complain because [NOISE] they never --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would have done anything.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Well, I think that's the -- the biggest problem really is that, you know, in so many businesses with the world being, you know, that [inaudible] employment and all these things that there really isn't a lot of ways for people to say, you know, do something w- -- you know, within the work place because, you know, I've known work places that were very, very hostile to certain groups of people and, you know, either, I mean, I actually worked in -- a- as a police dispatcher and people were very -- just 'cause the -- the nature of the work that they did, they just were against minorities, and against people who were gay, and I'm just, like, you know, I don't think this is right at all --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but what do you do, you know, because it's my word against theirs --
R:  Right.
L:  -- eventually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, and -- and unfortunately like there's not a lot of rules that govern employers that well and -- and, you know, employees don't really have a lot of rights.  So, it's very easy to say, well, you know, we got rid of this person because of this or because we just felt like it and it's not because of race or any other thing but --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- it -- unfortunately often it is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I was -- I would -- I would like to see a lot more protections for employees than there really are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's the -- that's my, I mean, having worked in a lot of jobs [LAUGH] so, and not in management, that's just my opinion.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Ten minutes up yet?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, I know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like, if once I get to the point of the, you know, you kind of say what you think it's, like, wow, [SIGH] yeah, I know, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at least it's not, yeah, a really boring, inconsequential --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- topic like sports strikes, which --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I care nothing about, so [LAUGH] -- so, where are you at?
R:  Maryland.
L:  Maryland?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Iowa actually.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, but I used to live in, ah, New Jersey, so --
R:  Where in New Jersey?
L:  Ah, central New Jersey, in North Brunswick actually, right by Rutgers university.
R:  I lived in Middle Town.
L:  Oh really.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's r- -- around the same area, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, well, I'm not -- I haven't lived there any time recently, but that's where I grew up, so --
R:  Uh-huh, you miss it?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, yeah, actually I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A friend of mine was, um, planning to go up to New Jersey for a concert this weekend and I was like, you know, if it wasn't just, you know, a matter of getting in the car and going right now, I probably --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- would have gone.  [LAUGH] It's like, oh, I miss it, but.  Yeah, Iowa's not that exciting, but I guess that's part of the reason, you know, why my opinions are the way they are, is because having been out in Iowa, there are people who are very close minded.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  So, sadly enough.  I don't know, it's -- it's just -- it's hard for me to take because like, you know, I grew up in a environment where it was so racially mixed that I just don't understand it at all.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's just like, I mean, I grew up in, you know, high school where, you know, I, you know, like my -- like my two closest friends were -- one was Jewish and one was, ah, Hindu, and like you come out here and that would never happen.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, it's just, I don't know, but it always distresses me quite a bit to see how people act.  I'm like, "You know, it's just because here you haven't been out in the real world to talk to people of different races that you feel this way", and it's kind of sad, but fortunately it is getting better, so --
R:  Oh, I don't know.  Where I used to work, um, [LIPSMACK] a -- a lot of the black people were always, like, "It's the white man keeping us down", or "The -- the boss made us do something.  You're only making us do it 'cause we're black", and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it was, you don't want to voice your opinion, [LAUGH] make things worse.
L:  Yeah.  I guess I can see that.  I mean, in a situation like that what do you say, but it's -- it's -- yeah, it's the same thing that where I was people -- with people who, just, you know, hate Mexicans and they're just, like, "Oh, they're, you know, they just don't have any work ethic and they just come to leech off of our -- of our society", and I'm, like, "Well, I don't think that's really fair", I mean, I'm sure that's true for some people, but, you know, it's -- I don't know, but -- actually, the work place I'm in now, surprisingly enough, is very diverse and people don't even seem to notice, which is kind of refreshing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, for Des Moines, you know [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --that people -- they're, you know, it- it's probably a -- one of the most diverse places in the area, just because it's, ah, you know, relatively unskilled, sadly enough, so there are a lot of young people in there.  I don't know, it's -- it's kind of refreshing 'cause, you know, I sit next to people who are all different ethnicities and everybody seems to, you know, never really bring it up, which is kind of interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I don't know, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess there was a big decision lately on affirmative action in the Supreme Court about university acceptance, which, of course, I -- you know, I think it's kind of interesting 'cause I did go to college and it was one of those things where, it is frustrating to see people who don't really want to be there as much as other people get it -- take advantage of it, but on the other hand --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, there are a lot of bad schools out there.  People who don't really have the same opportunities too.  It's how do you protect both?  You know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like a -- ass much as I really want to protect people's equality, it's like, well, you know, not having any safe guards for people to be taken advantage of by people who are as close minded is not really quality either, so [SIGH] --so, I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] So, how did you get involved with the, um, the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this experiment thing.
R:  I read about it on line.
L:  Oh, yeah, me too.  So, I just was cruising around.
R:  What -- do you read Refunding Makes Sense?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Refunding Makes Sense?
L:  No.  I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- was actually -- I just saw it at Google dot com I think.
R:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
L:  So, it just popped up for some reason, something I was searching for, so, I just signed up and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- here I am.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  There's a web site where like people post deals and everything and everybody were po- -- was posting the link and I know a whole lot of people that have done five phone calls.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I'd signed up and I was too chicken.  They called like maybe ten times [LAUGH] and I just kept hanging up.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, th- -- I -- I always seem to get calls for the wrong moment, but once in a while I'll get one where I'm not doing anything, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, what are they doing?  Like testing your voice?
L:  I don't know exactly what the criteria are honestly.  As they say, just want to study social interactions or they want to study how people from different areas get along or re- -- what they talk about on different topics or how that works, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't -- I honestly don't know.
R:  Um, be interesting to see their results.
L:  Yeah, it will be.  Actually, I used to take, like, ah, university surveys for a living for a while, so I would think it's kind of interesting to see that sort of when, you know, the public gets involved in different kinds of research it is kind of interesting to see how it turns out.  To see what people think of what -- what -- I don't -- I don't know if the topics are really of relevance, or if that's just to get people talking to one another --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but --
