R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Brenda.
R:  Ah, I'm Krishna.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Oh, fine.
R:  I'm here in Minnesota.  Where are you?
L:  In Texas.
R:  Texas, wow. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  At least central time though.  [PAUSE] This is nice.  Wh- what do you think is wrong with the public system today, public school system?
L:  Well, [MN] ah, I don't have any kids in school now but, ah, I think a lot of what's wrong, ah, they're not paying the teachers enough.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's one of it.  Another part of it is, ah, I think they're, ah, pushing too much on the teachers and then they don't want to pay 'em and they don't want to, you know -- Texas, like right down in Texas, I think some of the small areas, the rural areas, they're --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- some of the worse paid school teachers in the United States.
R:  Oh.
L:  Our teachers down here don't make nothing hardly.  They're doing it for --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- forty thousand a year.
R:  Oh, ah.
L:  Now if you're in a big city like Dallas, Houston, now you make money.  But --
R:  Mm.  Not teachers.
L:  -- as far as schools, they need to incorporate to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- pay the teachers more.  The superintendent needs to make more and they just need to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- discipline the kids better.  Ah, I know our school system down here where we are have already pulled out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- those coke machines and the snack machines --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- trying to, you know, ah, take more, ah, serious interest in the kids health instead of them eating junk food, so they'll eat their lunches.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I think a lot of it's just underpaid and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- overworked staff and not enough of 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If they'd offer more incentive I think they'd have more teachers.
R:  Right.  You -- so you think basically the problem lies in the tea- -- the teaching and of, ah, the payment scale of it?  The --
L:  Yes, and the [inaudible].
R:  -- the administration they don't pay enough --
L:  Yeah, the administration either --
R:  -- to the teachers that's why the schools are bad?
L:  -- and they need to really, really, ah, screen people who they hire to work in school systems --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because you have to be -- you need to be careful who you put in there.
R:  Right.
L:  Because I know down here just in our area here a long time ago, this is several years ago, they hired a superintendent and it -- on- one afternoon he was caught gambling in a motel room --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- poker game and he got arrested.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  At three o'clock in the afternoon.  Now, where should he have been?  He should have been at school attending to the kids.
R:  [MN] Absolutely.  That is so sad.  I think the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- whole system -- the schooling system needs some serious revamping and rethinking.
L:  Yes it does.
R:  I seriously think that -- I -- I personally believe that there should be uniforms in -- in schools.  I think --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- the children should be dressed in uniform that brings a little more discipline.  Not many people agree with me, but I, ah, really think so, so that it takes your mind off of dressing and looking good and pay more attention to studies.  Everybody wears the same clothes to school, that's what you see in private schools.  Not that all private schools are great, but I really think that they produce better results, produce better students than public schools.
L:  Yeah, they should --
R:  They should be dressed --
L:  -- yeah, they should --
R:  -- equally.  There should be --
L:  -- and they do --
R:  -- more discipline.
L:  -- you know, wear uniforms.  I agree on that.
R:  What is that?
L:  I said they to, ah, wear uniforms or get -- it's -- 'cause, ah, some of way these kids dress to go to school is outrageous.
R:  Absolutely.  They -- what not do they wear?  My goodness, that would put -- I can not look straight.  I was at one of the restaurants with my husband and I saw a prom kids come out --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there, and it was prom night and it was very busy and the kind of outfits the girls wore.  I understand prom night is a big night and kids don't dress that way in school, but the very fact that they could think of dressing like that, my goodness.  I almost thought whether my children should go to school.  It was absolutely outrageous.  It is very scary to see that and it's not just coming with the dress part of it, there are so many other things.  The way they behave.  I have seen -- I have heard that kids kind of -- they -- they -- they stick their feet on the benches in front of their teachers.  I mean, some sort of physical respect is important and I think behavior part of it.  That -- it -- it de- -- that's how I was raised so I guess that's how I -- I look at it.  Definitely the kids need to --there needs to be better discipline in school and it comes with -- you know, you get better teachers.  For better teachers you need to pay them better.
L:  Yeah and some of these parents they need to start jumping in and disciplining their kids at home as well.
R:  Mhm.  How do we do that?  How -- how do we correct that situation?  I mean, it's passing the buck.  I -- I guess parents can say the -- the school is bad, and school can say it all starts at home, but --
L:  Well, I don't know because right now -- and like I said said, ah, in the scho- school where my son went to school at it was a real small school system.  So, I mean, it had like under three hundred kids right from kindergarten through twelfth grade.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They've got a no tolerance policy there now.
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah, no tolerance what -- you know, no time for tolerance or anything.  Zero tolerance rule, ah, they've changed the dre- dress code.  Kids can't go anywhere just 'cause they want to anymore.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And they believe, you know -- and we've got a lot of 'em that have graduated from high school doing good in school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, and going on to college.  We've got one that graduated several years ago.  Well, she's a -- she's, ah, going through her, ah, medical training now --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- to be a doctor.
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  Ah, and we've got several others that are going to computer programs and stuff that are doing fine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just like my daughter-in-law, ah, her cousin just graduated --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he got a scholarship to nursing school.  He wants to be a n- -- male nurse and that's what he's going to do and he got a scholarship.  He made good grades --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- played sports.  But we've got -- I mean, we've still got our groups of kids that, you know, like to get in trouble and start trouble.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's what they need to crack down on.
R:  Right, right.
L:  'Cause the trouble is the good kids into something.
R:  Mhm.  What do you think apart from paying teachers right and better, what else do you think could be helped, ah -- could help the school system?
L:  For them to have always -- you know, to have some type of, you know -- some monies available somewhere or to have more s- -- have activities for kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Better ways for them to learn and more interesting ways to teach 'em.
R:  Mhm.  I -- I -- I think corporate helping -- corporate, ah, support may help but then it gets to be commercial and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you -- you -- it -- it -- it -- it's a whole new issue.  So really, how do you fund schools better?  What else can we use to -- property taxes go to schools, what else could be used to help schools?
L:  Yeah, I know one thing, those teachers need some decent health insurance.
R:  Insurance?
L:  Yes, medical.  A lot of 'em don't have it.
R:  Are you a teacher yourself?
L:  Ah, ah, no, but I've got, ah, several people -- my parents know teachers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and stuff that are working and I know a couple of teachers from school and all that stuff and their main complaint was -- and even the, ah, hired help, like the teacher aides --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the cafeteria workers main complaints were they didn't have health insurance.
R:  Oh, my God.  [LIPSMACK] That is --
L:  And --
R:  -- so sad. 
L:  Yeah, a friend of mine was working in the cafeteria but she quit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and for two years of all the nonsense she had to put up with and everything, ah -- she's a hard worker, she done a good job with whatever she done and everything, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  One day she found a bug in the food and she said to them about it and she got fired from her job for bringing it up.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  She used to think it was very healthy, very safe for kids eating that food.
R:  Oh, gosh.
L:  She spoke her mind and it got her kicked out of a job, but she wasn't making but five fifty an hour.
R:  Oh, Lord. [LIPSMACK]  That is sad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, what to -- that is so sad.  So I guess there's not enough freedom of speech even in the teaching profession.
L:  Not if you say anyth- -- open your mouth and say anything at some of these smaller schools or a- --.  But any school, they don't want you saying anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They can always kick you out of a job.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I don't think that's right either.
R:  Exactly, that's not right.
L:  'Cause she needed her job and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- meanwhile they fired her --
R:  Oh, Lord.
L:  -- because she spoke her mind.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she was tired of seeing -- there's two other women in the lunchroom getting away with stuff that they shouldn't be getting away with and she called them on it.
R:  Oh, gosh. [MN]
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's just the type, she's not going to put up with [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if it had been me I probably would have done the same thing.
R:  Yeah.  What else can be done?  Wow.  That is sad when you --
L:  And, you know, some parents could get more involved --
R:  -- hear of all these stories.  What's that?
L:  Ah, when I used to go to P.T.O. meetings and stuff for my child and all that stuff for Steven when he was still in school, ah, there was not enough -- did you know teachers didn't even show up for the meetings?
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And the superintendent didn't either.
R:  Oh, Lord.
L:  Now, that's sad. 
R:  You know, my kids are five and two, and they have yet to go into, um, schooling.  So I really don't know, um, how it's going to be because they're still very little and have not attended -- they have not gone to school as such.
L:  And something else too I don't believe should happen, I don't believe the school should start in August.
R:  When do you think it should start?
L:  Yeah, I -- I think it should start first of September.
R:  Oh.  You know, in Minnesota schools starts in September.
