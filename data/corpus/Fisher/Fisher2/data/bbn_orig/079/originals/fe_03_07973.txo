L:  [NOISE] Okay. [NOISE]
R:  Hey, how're you doing?
L:  [NOISE] Hi, how you doing?
R:  [NOISE] Good, this is Darryl.
L:  That's good, my name's Olive. [MN]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] How're you doing?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, it's --
L:  Oh --
R:  Alison? [NOISE]
L:  What's tha- what was that again?
R:  Alison?
L:  A- Olive.  Olive is my --
L:  Alice.
R:  -- name.  Yeah,  yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  All right.  So, what do you think? [NOISE]
L:  Uh, I don't know what it is.  Explain, please?
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] I haven't been paying --
R:  Affirmative --
L:  -- enough attention --
R:  -- action --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- is, um, like, um, [NOISE] it's having a quota, for, let's say, I have to i- I have to hire so many Hispanics in my corporation.
L:  Oh, I know what you're saying.
R:  [NOISE] And, you know, so, basically affirmative action, I believe, is saying that, yeah, that's w- we have to have this many people in our --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- corporation for our corporation to be [SIGH] um --
L:  Legal.
R:  [NOISE] Ve- it's --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- fair for -- fair for mon- minorities, basically. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So [NOISE] for work place and schools. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  So, basically it's a --
L:  [inaudible] it is --
R:  -- I, uh --
L:  -- a college thing.
R:  [NOISE] It's not really college, I mean, it's --i- it happens in workplaces, [NOISE] um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it -- did you ever apply for a job and then you get that little -- you get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that little thing in the mail?
L:  And yeah, I --
R:  And it says, "Check here if you're Hispanic or Caucasian or" ... [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what?  Yeah, I -- [LAUGH] what do I think about that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you think about it?
R:  [LAUGH] We- we- I -- I'm firmly against it, I'm -- I get screwed on it in all aspects, I'm a white, single male. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] That would -- yeah, you would -- and you would have a problem --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with that.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I get screwed with everything.
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  So, I'm a --
L:  I can --
R:  -- uh, you know --
L:  -- understand why you wouldn't be very happy about that [NOISE] at all.  I don't really know what to say, I -- it sh- should not be necessary.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It should not be --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- necessary at all.  I mean pe- people should be hired based on their abilities, you know, and -- and the trouble of it is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I -- I don't know, it's kinda hard to imagine people being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- racist these days, but I know they are --
R:  Well, it -- it --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- I think affirmative action is a form of racism. [NOISE]
L:  Ye- well, yeah, it certainly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- discriminates against the, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the white, single male --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I me- yeah, I'm on, you know, it can +discriminaga- discriminate against the blacks if there's -- if there's too many blacks in the corporation and they want to hire a Hispanic. [NOISE] And what they --
L:  Oh, I see --
R:  -- do, I --
L:  -- right.  Yeah, that's true --
R:  -- [NOISE] I be-
L:  -- that's true.
R:  -- w- what I believe they also do is they have a points system [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] where, [NOISE] you know, you get so many points for, let's say you're handicapped, you [NOISE] get --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- you get -- you get a ton of points for that and that's all goes against your, um, [SIGH] your taxes.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] I believe that's true. [NOISE]
L:  Sort of like a --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- like a, [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  You get a tax break for how many --
L:  Right.
R:  -- handicapped or how many blacks and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how many Hispanics or whatever. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  Right.  Whoa.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I --
R:  But --
L:  -- you know, I don't know what to say, I -- I do think that it is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- true that people have been discriminated against over the years.  I -- I -- I think they have been.  I was raised in the south, you know, and I -- I'm not going to deny that there was a lot of discrimination and, you know, these people really didn't get much chance, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on the other hand, it -- I think it's possible to go the other way too far.  You know, I --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- it should not have to be an issue.  It sh- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people should be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hired --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- regardless of what color they are, they should be hired on whatever the reasons --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are that they need to be hired for.  You know, uh, what they -- what they can do for the job and --
R:  [NOISE] So --
L:  -- so on and so forth.
R:  -- based on the education a- and job set, uh, job skills instead of race or, um --
L:  Right.  Well and --
R:  -- ethnicity.
L:  -- and, I guess -- I guess the catch twenty two there is that -- that, you know, some people feel like they've been discriminated against for education and they can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they have a harder time getting an education because of the, you know --
R:  You know what?  When I --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- went to college --
L:  -- just don't know exactly, I don't know what to think about it.
R:  When I went to college there was more black people in my college than anything and --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- all these -- all these --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all these black --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fellas got a free ride --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- because they were from the inner city of Detroit --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- got free ride in there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ninety percent of them dropped out within the first year, because they were getting a free ride and they just came up --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- there to party.
L:  -- I see the problem.  It didn't help them in the long run, because they didn't have to work for it.
R:  [NOISE] Right, well, I didn't get a free ride, my parents made too much money, so I couldn't get any kind of assistance --
L:  And maybe that was the best thing for you. [NOISE]
R:  And, but --
L:  You know --
R:  -- my --
L:  -- maybe that's why you finished, because you had to work. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Right, that's exactly it, right?  I mean --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- I had to go out and, uh, get my own money --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and get my own loans and I'm still --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- paying 'em back.
L:  My kids have had to do the same thing, we're Caucasian [SIGH] and -- and, um, [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] yeah, I mean there's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I think -- I think things can go too far, I mean if a person is [NOISE] [SIGH] in a position where no matter how hard they work and no matter how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dependable they are, they're going to, not go- not -- not going to have the benefits because of the color of their skin, I think that's wrong.  You know, um, in any situation I think that that should not --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- play into it, their -- their race.  But, you know, it is also true that if you -- if you give somebody something for free they don't appreciate it.
R:  Exactly. [NOISE] I --
L:  They often don't.
R:  -- I agree with that one hundred percent.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they [NOISE] and it seems to me like it would be better to insist that, well, there needs to be some sort of a check and -- check and a balance if some- somebody feels that they have been discriminated against when they do qualify --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that they would get a fair hearing, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, yeah, I don't know, I don't know.
R:  But at what point --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- do you know that they have, you know, that they're, wha- at what point --
L:  It's hard to prove.
R:  -- do you say that they're getting discriminated against?
L:  Yeah, it's hard to prove, isn't it?  Yeah --
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  -- because, you know, they don't know all the other applicants and, you know, I mean, it's kind of a closed door thing, so how are you going to know?
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] And, uh, [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's -- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this is not a fair world, I guess we're going to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have to wait till somebody bigger and more powerful than a human being is in charge of it before really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- things will start happening right, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I'm not -- personally I would call that [SIGH] that power the creator, I -- that's -- to me that would be -- that would be God himself, you know, once -- once he gets, you know, takes charge and -- and I mean really takes, um, shall I say, obvious ch- I mean, he's in charge now, he's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he's back behind the scenes, but someday he's going to come and literally rule, I believe, and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- I believe at that point that, um, yeah, things are going to be fair. [LAUGH] You know --
R:  Well, I don't --
L:  -- 'cause he -- 'cause -- because he's fair, he's the creator.
R:  Well, you know, it's the power of choice, though.
L:  What's that?
R:  You know, He gives us the power of choice, that's what make us -- makes us individuals.
L:  Right.  Right, but I --
R:  [NOISE] You know?
L:  -- think -- I think once everybody's answering directly to Him, and He's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- taking care of things that go -- you know, if somebody misbehaves they get -- they get punished fairly, you know, I mean according to how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it should be, I think people are gonna behave better.
R:  Well, it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was, I mean, people are punished like -- like that right now.
L:  What's that?
R:  Uh, mm --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- couldn't hear.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Oh, people are punished like that right now. [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, that's what Hell's for. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Hell -- yeah, Hell is for punishing sins and thankfully, Jesus died for our sins so we don't have to go to Hell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, if we'll just accept his gift and that's the -- that's the part that really makes everything come out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right in the long run is that, you know, if you can -- if you can accept that from God --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then you -- you literally don't have to go to Hell for your sins.  You know, He, basically His death paid for our sins. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And, you know, we -- we just accept that -- that gift of His payment, His blood, which --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so the blood of Jesus Christ [inaudible] cleanses us from all sins.  If we accept that payment, then we don't have to go to Hell --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, the payment is made.
R:  Right.  I think we're getting a little off topic, now.
L:  Yeah, we are, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- how's we off of it?  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, yeah, I don't know, um, I guess affirmative action is, you know, the world's way of trying to make things more equal, you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  And --
R:  Now, do you believe the -- do -- do you believe that there's certain --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, jobs that men can do better than women and women --
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- can do better than men?
L:  -- I do.  Absolutely, I do.  I believe there's gender differences that God has built in and -- and, uh, you know, to ignore them is just plain silly.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, I'm not going to say that women --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- women are -- are qualified as far as their, um, ability to -- and their intelligence [NOISE] but women -- often -- often our -- our skills --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- between --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- men and women are -- are [NOISE] focused in different areas and I think that we certainly, um, [NOISE] who best to take -- to respect that, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think everybody gets off easier when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when they do things the way the creator set it up.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know, which is that men and women are different. [LAUGH] You know, it's here for --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- different reasons and when they work together then the work gets done.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  [NOISE] You know, at least --
R:  Now --
L:  -- that's my opinion, anyway, how do you feel about it? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Oh well, uh, yeah, you know, I -- [NOISE] I think, you know, women make better bookkeepers, um, [NOISE] you know --
L:  Housekeepers [NOISE] --
R:  -- strippers, um [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, that's not such a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- good thing, actually.
R:  I know, but that was funny --
L:  [MN] Well, yeah, yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right, but it wasn't right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They -- they do make better strippers, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I mean, 'cause they're--
L:  -- well --
R:  -- you know --
L:  -- what can I say?
R:  -- when they're sanding the floor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  They're --
R:  -- they're --
L:  -- probably sinning at the same time, that's the problem.
R:  Right.
L:  Unless they're with --
R:  Other than that males -- and males make better construction workers, you know --
L:  Yeah, oh yeah, I ag- totally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- agree with that.  Totally --
R:  So --
L:  -- agree with that there, I mean our, the -- even the muscles -- muscle arrangement is -- I mean not the arrangement is different, but you know, men usually have longer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] muscles that are better for lifting loads and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know --
R:  Right.
L:  You can't really --
R:  But --
L:  -- get -- get -- get around that, I mean that's just the way [NOISE] we're made, you know, [NOISE] in general, I mean on the [NOISE] average, we can't -- there are always exceptions both ways. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  And it's -- y- you know, but I -- I don't think ...
