L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Rebecca Shaw.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  What is --
R:  Hi, Rebecca.
L:  Hi.  What is your name?
R:  Um, Lee Robertson.
L:  Uh-huh.  Now, where are you calling from?
R:  From, uh, Denver, Colorado.
L:  Oh, wow.  I'm in --
R:  And where --
L:  -- uh -- I'm in Bloomfield, New Jersey.
R:  Oh, no kidding?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  So, um, w- so what -- what do we do now?  I'm -- thi- this is actually the first time I've done this, so do you --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- know?
L:  Yeah, well, you just talk, uh, about the subject and they're gonna -- they're monitoring it, I guess, so they, uh, they can study the patterns of the way people interact, you know, on different types of subjects in --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- conversation.  But, um, I did this once before, they -- [MN] the first ti- a few times they called me and I wa- I didn't have my cellphone turned on, but, um, the last topic was much easier, it was about sports and what kind of sports I liked [LAUGH] and --
R:  Mhm --
L:  -- what type of --
R:  -- okay.
L:  -- weather.  This is --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- a little more, uh, I guess it's a more sensitive issue and political.  You know?
R:  Right.  I -- I -- you know, I know the -- you know, the Supreme Court just ruled, let's see, in favor the -- there -- it was kind of a -- a two part, uh, [NOISE] the way I understand was a two part, um, uh, issue --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and deci- decision, um, on the University of Michigan --
L:  -chigan, yeah.
R:  -- um, y- you know, they -- they w- were in favor of -- of, uh, race, you know, being a factor --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a partially, you know, partially, but, um, uh, the other side of the issue was that, you know, they -- they [SIGH] voted against, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, like, a point system for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- other, you know, like, particularly for whites and, uh, y- you know, they -- they would -- the university would give a -- a point system and the- and they declared that unconstitutional --
L:  Right.
L:   -- so to, um, y- yo- t- if -- if they're asking me, you know, where I stand on that, I mean, I -- I -- I know the black people have been oppressed and I know they've, um, you know, are trying to, you know, remedy that, um, through affirmative action for, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] you know, many years, uh, I -- I think that the time has come where it really should be a leg- level playing field for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, for everybody.
L:  Right.  I agree.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  Uh, how -- how would you propose doing that, though?  Uh, do you -- do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think affirmative action across the board is a good idea or w- what --
R:  Well, I think -- I think it -- it ha- has, i- i- I think it has been in the past, you know, I -- I -- affirmative action has been on, y- you know, a policy in this country for many years, I mean probably --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what, seventy five years or so and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I --
L:  On different --
R:  -- think the ti-
L:  -- levels.
R:  -- yeah, I think the time has come where, you know, particularly the -- the -- the African American race, which wa- has been oppressed in this country, obviously, and -- and it was a good thing that, you know, we did rectify that, but I think the -- the black people in this country have finally achieved equality with the whites and -- and -- and, you know, all the races and I think the time has come to end it is -- is the -- where -- where I -- where I'm coming from.
L:  Oh, really?  I don't --
R:  If --
L:  -- really -- yeah, I -- I don't agree with you, there, I -- I -- I see a lot of, uh, uh, in- inequality in the workplace and -- and -- and, you know, it takes -- takes -- I think it's gonna take years for people -- can you hear me?  Are -- are we breaking up?
R:  Yeah, I can hear you -- I can -- I'm on my cellphone, it -- so it's -- but --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- but I can hear you, I can hear you good.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, I think it's going to take years for, um, for that feeling of -- of, uh, race, um, superiority that's been indoctrinated into our system to -- to disappear, although I think, I mean, certainly -- things are certainly better than they were.  Now I live in New York, I mean, I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not -- I live near New York, I -- I grew up in New York and I'm near Newark in New Jersey --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- which is very large, um, uh, area of color and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've worked a lot in, um, in -- what they call inner city areas as a dance teacher, so, um, I don't see it as having gotten that much better for a lot of people, especially with the rate of unemployment as high as it is, it's -- it affects black people a- and -- and pe- and non white people, um, I think at -- at -- at a much higher and a much more intense way and I've been -- I just got a job aft- a part time job after being unemployed for two years, so --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm -- and I'm white, Jewish, uh, so I'm not -- I'm not saying it, um, you know, I mean, it's been hard for a lot of people, not just for black people, but, um, I -- I think it's even harder for them.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I -- I'm in favor of affirmative action, I think what the -- a- and I -- although I don't particularly, I'm -- I tend to be very, uh, liberal, so I -- I often don't agree with the Supreme Court, but I think what they did in this case was good, maybe I'm -- [LIPSMACK] you know, maybe I'll change my mind later, I -- I -- I think what the -- it -- the decision really says is that, we do have to take color into consideration --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but we need to look at the whole person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, like, when you it on a point basis, like, you know, whites count for less than black people, [LAUGH] or, [NOISE] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- every black person is going to rate, like, if it's -- if ten is the highest score or something, or -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- every -- every black person's gonna rate ten, well, that's ridiculous because obviously there are people like those, uh, like those reporters, uh, what's his name, Blair?  The guy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, tha- who faked it, um, who got by at The New York Times because he was black? [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that writer, so, um, you know, you don't want to just m- uh, automatically accept every black person because they're black and negate every white person because they're white --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- I don't --
R:  -- see, that's what I'm saying is that -- is the danger of the affirmative action concept, it's -- it's like a -- almost a quota system, uh, it can be, but --
L:  Well, but there's -- but they -- but they -- [MN] they didn't -- [MN] the part that's the quota system with the formula they, uh, they ruled it out.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah, no, I -- yeah, which -- which, you know, I -- I really support, I mean I s- I -- I really think, you know, in -- in my case, I'm a -- I'm a bus driver in -- in the Denver area and my terminal, I -- I feel like I'm a minority because eighty percent, I would say, are black people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, I --
L:  That's [inaudible] --
R:  -- feel like I'm in the mor- minority --
L:  Well, that's hard.
R:  -- but I -- I don't -- I don't have any, I can say this or, I don't feel any, uh, pro- I haven't had any problems, you know, with black people and, yeah, in fact --
L:  Right.
R:  -- many of them are my -- my friends so I -- I -- I just don't see a need for it any more.  I --
L:  No --
R:  -- I -- I --
L:  Well, maybe --
R:  -- I ju- I just --
L:  -- it's better there, or, is that a middle class community, or is it a --
R:  No --
L:  -- wha- a --
R:  -- actually -- actually it's -- it's, like, almost [MN] verg- uh, [MN] you know, being on the verge of a ghetto kind of a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- area tha- that --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- I'm in.
L:  -- interesting.
R:  And -- and -- and that's why I'm saying is that if -- if you want to work, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mean y- you can, uh, you know, fill out the same job -lica- job application I did --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and -- and get a job and we should all be on that level playing field.  No -- no person should go to the front of the line, is what I'm saying.
L:  Right, well --
R:  Um --
L:  -- uh, I'm not sure, I mean, obviously, I mean, like, where [MN] in your bus company, for instance, uh, who were --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the people who hire, are they white or black?  Or are they mix- a mixture?
R:  Yeah, it -- it's actually a mix, yeah.
L:  Well, that's why you don't feel it as much where you live, beca- or -- or in that -- in that particular company, because -- which is good, I think, you know, that, um, yo- maybe you don't need the affirmative action rulings working there, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if -- if you're an area where most of the, uh, employers are white and, you know, like the area's, I don't know, I'd say where -- where the people who are doing the hiring are white, and making the decisions are white, then -- and I think you have to bring more of the affirmative action things into play, because, you know, you can't assume that every white person is going to be as liberal or, I mean, maybe you don't like the word liberal, so [LAUGH] people have different --
R:  Well --
L:  -- feelings about that word, but as --
R:  No that's a --
L:  -- as open --
R:  -- that's a good --
L:  -- minded --
R:  -- classification.
L:  -- as open --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- minded as you, or even your company, you know, I mean obviously not every company is --is discriminating, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, things have changed, they certainly have changed in certain areas, but not -- not enough and not across the board and not, um, [LIPSMACK] when it comes to colleges and colleges have s- especially in a time of high unemployment, have so- and a hi- a time of, uh, an era of -- of hi- very high technology--
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they -- they play such an important part in people getting the, uh, the higher level jobs, um, if you're going to discriminate, if -- if there's discrimination at the level of -- of entering college, it's going to affect the students' whole life.  So, um, and, uh, a lot of those colleges tend to be, you know, Ivy League and, um, they have traditions, but, you know, are steeped in that and it -- i- it's -- it's -- it's hard to see it unless, you know, I mean unless you did, uh, a -- an investigation across the country of every single college, but I think allowing affirmative action to exist on some level [LIPSMACK] um, is probab ...
