R:  Hi, my name is Anne.
L:  My name is Pam.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Pretty good, and you?
R:  Good, thanks.  Well, affirmative action.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I can kind of understand  why there are affirmative action policies, but I don't always think that they're necessarily good -- a good thing.  What do you think about 'em?
L:  Um, I agree.  Um ... I work in a place where, um, for a long time women haven't had an opportunity to advance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and now they are getting it a -- an opportunity, but I still -- um, men are -- they still have attitudes where women can't do things and, um, but sometimes with affirmative action they just promote people because of the fact that they're a minority and you can't do anything to that person because they're a minority --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that frustrates me.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know, I mean, I'm not a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- minority besides, I guess, the fact of being a woman, and even that I think in a lot of places is really a majority --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] but it seems to me like, affirmative action sort of, I guess in some ways, even though it gives people a chance that they might not always have.  I don't know, if I were a minority I might be offended if I were hired under an affirmative action policy because -- just because I was satisfying some quota that I -- it wasn't necessarily because of my [LIPSMACK] ability or education or anything like that, ah, ah.  In some ways I think it can sort of promote discrimination, because it [SIGH] might give people the [SIGH] -- the feeling that someone was just hired simply because of the color of his or her skin or gender or race or background or whatever.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know, it's -- it seems to me like sometimes we're trying to make up for wrongs that were committed in the past that really can't be made up for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't solve --
L:  And --
R:  -- these -- a problem that's just sort of creating another problem.
L:  Yeah.  Like at where I work, there -- there's a black woman who is a day time supervisor and she is totally incompetent, but there's nothing that can be done because she's a black female --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, anybody could do her job better than her, you know, and she causes problems for the entire plant because she can't do her job competently.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the smallest things, she can't seem to do, and nothing will be done to her because she can't do her job and she keeps getting promoted to different jobs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because she's not able to do any of them, you know, and --
R:  All in the name of diversity.
L:  Well, because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they keep trying to find some place to put her --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where she'll do less and less damage, I guess.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, because she is in management they can't get rid of her.  They can't downsize her, you know, they can't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and she's safe.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and it's very frustrating for us who have to deal with the fact that she, you know, doesn't order equipment for us, you know, that we need and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, so, in that case affirmative action has -- has caused people in my plant a lot of heartache.
R:  Yeah.  It's done more harm than good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.  I -- I don't know if there's ever going to be a solution to it because it seems i- if you don't have affirmative action or if you do, we still -- a- and most people, including myself, that I know, either subconsciously, or very consciously, judge people or make judgments about them based on the color of their skin or their gender.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, I don't -- I don't know if we -- we'll ever be able to get away from that.  I mean --
L:  Well --
R:  -- it just -- it sort of seems part of human nature that we've -- we look at people and make assumptions about them, whether good or bad, based on what they look like and --
L:  Yeah.  I know that, um -- I've heard that if you're good looking, um, you have a better chance of getting a job.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No matter whether you're male or female.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I -- I've heard they've done that -- studies on that.  So, no matter what gender you are or race you are, you know, you're -- i- if you're ugly you're just out of luck.
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  But then [LAUGH] --
L:  -- affirmative action isn't going to help you there.
R:  Yeah, and then again if they, ah, [SIGH] if you are too attractive, and I don't know how --
L:  You may be thought stupid.
R:  Right [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- people don't think that you have anything to offer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- either.  I guess the best way to be is maybe sort of in the middle.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I know where I work, um, first you have to pass a test and then you get on a roster, and when there's an opening, um, the top three people on the roster are, um -- or maybe it's the top five, are invited to the interview --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, because it's a quasi federal government kind of thing, um, veterans preference plays a bit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in that, um, but there's no, um, [SIGH] ah, affirmative action --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in getting hired.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There's veterans preference, but -- and -- and veterans disability, but that's it.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, it's [SIGH] -- it just seems like a --
L:  But, for promotions --
R:  Yeah.  It just seems like a -- a problem that's created because, you know, we -- we want, ah, diversity, we want everybody to, you know -- to be a part of this great melting pot, but yet we [LAUGH] -- we've done so many things in the past to exclude people for whatever reason, that now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it sort of seems like the p- -- the pendulum of discrimination or th- -- equality has swung past the center to the other side where now we're [COUGH] we used to discriminate against people, now we're discriminating, I guess, for them.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and that's not right either because then like, my brothers get passed over for things --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, I have more brothers, I don't have any sisters --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, you know --
R:  Yeah, I think f- -- I think for a lot of young white males who probably have never, [LIPSMACK] ah, intentionally promoted, you know, discrimination or bigotry, I think it would probably very -- be very difficult for them to [SIGH] -- to find jobs.  Sometimes if you don't happen to have the skin color or the ethnicity that certain companies are looking for.
L:  Well, my stepson is now looking for work and he's in his middle twenties --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and what he's working in is in construction and he's having to travel quite a ways just to get work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the company that he was working with went belly up and his wife also lost her job at the same time.
R:  Oh, gees.
L:  Yeah, because she was also involved in the -- in, um, a similar project, but she was vice president of a bank, so she had a much better job than him but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  That's --
