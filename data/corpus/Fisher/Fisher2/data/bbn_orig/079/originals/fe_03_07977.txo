R:  Ah, yes.  This is Cindy.
L:  [NOISE] Li- -- this is Lisa.  I'm sorry, who's this again?
R:  My name is Cindy.
L:  Oh, okay. [MN]
R:  And what is it we're supposed to be talking about?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you understand that?
L:  Well, it -- it's just something like affirmative action and the policies, um -- did we think it was a good idea --
R:  Well, that's --
L:  -- having it in the workplace?
R:  That's a good question.  What do you think?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's not something I've thought about actually, but, um -- I'm a stay at home mom so I don't really pay attention to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] -- um --
R:  Well, I'm a stay at home mom also.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, are you? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes I am.  And by affirmative action --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do they mean like you are filling the quotas whether they have to hire, you know, women or men, or blacks or whites?  Is that what they're talking about?
L:  [NOISE] Well, see that's what I'm thinking.
R:  Okay, okay.  Because I've got a problem with that if that's what they're talking about, because --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- I feel like it sh- -- it should be whoever is most qualified for the job --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- not -- not what, you know -- what race or what sex that they are.
L:  [NOISE] Right, I agree.
R:  Because I see a lot of problems, I mean, just -- that's kind of a sore subject right now.  My husband works --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- for a large company and, ah, they started hiring women.  They had men out there for years.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause he works in a mine, he works for Silversmith.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  And, ah, doesn't go down to [several inaudible words] Silversmith.  Well they started le- letting women work there to fill these affirmative action --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- quotas about ten years ago I guess or so.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And, you know, that's kind -- you know, there's just some fields that women don't need to be in and I think --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- that's one of 'em because they have had so many problems --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and -- and so that's why -- that's why, you know -- that whenever somebody says affirmative action, I kind of cringe because --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- you -- I -- I guess there may be some instance where it's important, but you tell me where it's important because I haven't figured it out yet.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Um, do you live in Pennsylvania or ...?
R:  No, I live in --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  -- Texas.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] Well, I didn't know there were mines in Texas.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, well, in fact my husband works for Arcola which is based --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, he works for Arcola?
R:  [NOISE] -- in Pittsburgh.  Yes, yes.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] We have the, ah, largest, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- surface mine, the largest smelter and surface mine in the Uni- -- in the world. 
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] And it's down here in Texas where we live.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so we have a surface [NOISE] mine down here is what we have.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [NOISE] But like I said, they didn't have any women over here working in this area 'til probably about ten years ago I -- I guess or so.  And, you know, I think that's wrong because, you know, it should be who can handle the job and not just because they need to put another woman into that spot or they need to put another white or another black or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so --
L:  I agree.
R:  So you tell me, I'm a -- I've been spitting enough out.  So maybe you need to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- say something. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I agree.  Um, I just, you know -- sometimes I think well it might be good, only 'cause sometimes those people have a harder time getting jobs because they are women or because they are black, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but -- but I also feel that it should be the best person depending on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what color or race you are or whatever.
R:  You know, I kind of like those, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, where they have -- where you fill out the applications where it doesn't ask if you're white or black --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- or female or -- you know, 'cause I think that's probably the most fair --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- way of -- of looking at it, but --
L:  [NOISE] Right --
R:  -- whenever they start --
L:  [NOISE] -- and then they won't know.
R:  Right, they don't know.  So I mean, that's -- that's kind of a good way I think of -- of looking at and trying -- but you know what?  I mean, you know, but how in the world can you find out somebody's good at their job or something unless, you know, you -- you know what I mean?  If you're watching 'em, like who's going to get the promotion?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, we've seen, um -- you know, women that my husband -- that were hired --you know, my husband's being working for them for twenty three years and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- women that have only been there since like the last ten years when they first started hiring women, had been promoted over him because they had to have a woman to fill that affirmative action quota.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?  Which is not necessarily, you know, how -- but -- but unfortunately that's the way the world's working a lot now.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And I think that's almost a downfall --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to our country.  And I also have a -- you know, I don't know if you're white or black or what you are, but you know, I've -- I've -- I really feel like some of this affirmative action is working against people.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Because I feel like -- I almost feel like whites are in the minority now [MN] --
L:  [NOISE] Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- instead of -- you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know?  I mean, I feel like I need to be the one, you know, asking for, um, special privileges or whatever because it's like there's a -- you know, I don't know what it's like up there in Pennsylvania, but down here we're the minority.
L:  Oh, I don't live in Pennsylvania, just that -- ah, there's mines in --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- Pennsylvania.  I'm in Washington, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- but my --
R:  Way across the other side of the United States.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, but I know Arcola -- 'cause I used to live in Mosinee, New York and we have Arcola and Reynolds and all those --
R:  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Well, you know, I expect -- you know, affirmative action has probably been good in some respects because allowing, you know, women to get into more jobs or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- blacks or whatever to get into more jobs.  But -- so it's probably been good, but I think it's getting too overrated.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so -- anyway that's just what I think.
L:  Right, you're right --
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] -- it -- it's good to -- to help them get good jobs and, um -- since they might be qualified and they might not get the job because they're a woman, you know?
R:  Well, you know what makes me mad though is when I like hear about these Government contracts that only go to companies that have a certain, you know -- or are abiding by the affirmative action, you know, guidelines or whatever?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  You know, and that's -- that makes me angry too because that's not, you know, that's not necessarily who's going to do the best job or whatever.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so I've got a problem with that.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  So -- but it's like, how do you -- I mean there there's some good things that have happened because, you know -- I mean, more people are, you know -- it's more mixed.  There's -- there's no -- there's really no, um, set rules about, you know, who can be a miner or who can do this or who can do that.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  It's whoever -- whatever you want to do.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  But at the same time I think that kind of backfired against us also.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So -- I mean do you have any, ah, things that you can say?  Got any instances where it kind of worked against or you've seen bad results or whatever?
L:  [NOISE] Not really.  Um, you know, I used to be a teacher so there wasn't -- wasn't much there as far as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- um, although I used to -- I did live in Mississippi and when I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] -- taught there the, um -- they were kind of looking for more black teachers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- so if a white person had applied they were -- you know, the school is like fifty percent black and there was just so many white teachers that they wanted some black teachers in there.  And so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- I guess -- I mean, I had already had a position, but had I not and they would have picked someone else because they were black.  I might've been [LAUGH] upset, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] I mean, if they were --
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE] -- more qualified, fine.  But if I was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] -- so, um --
R:  Yeah, that's kind of -- that kind of gets on your nerves when --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- you find out, you know -- whenever you hear that somebody got something, or you know that somebody got a position just because they're a woman or they're black or they're whatever.  You know?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  It's like all those colleges and everything -- I've been reading a lot about the colleges, you know, they're having to fill their quotas.  You know, we're having problems like, ah, the University of Texas down here in Texas and --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and they're want- -- yeah, they're wanting to bring in, you know, to have to -- they are rejecting a lot of the white applicants because they want more blacks and more Asians I think --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- is what I was just reading.  And I thought, "You know, that's not fair" because, I mean, it should be --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- as to who's qualified --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- you know, who -- who does the -- who does the requirements?  You know, they're bringing in -- I mean, they're lowering the requirements for, you know, different groups just so they can get them into the college.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Well, I think, you know, what does that do?  I mean, that lowers the performance and that lowers, you know, the overall whatever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for the school.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  And I think --
L:  [NOISE] You're right.
R:  -- I think -- I think they've kind of -- but I -- you know, I see that in all the different fields --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because if you just -- if you're just hiring somebody because [MN] you know, of what they are instead of their qualifications, well then you're going to -- maybe that's why the United States is having problems.  That along with --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- everything else.  Maybe that's --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- why we're having some --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, really.
R:  -- problems, you know?  I mean, well, we're getting beat now aren't we? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, dear.  Um --
R:  I was --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it was in our paper too the other day about the colleges.  But I didn't read the article but I did read the headline, it mentioned something about picking, you know, different people to go to college and the -- the requirements they had to do. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Just a minute honey, I'm on the phone.
R:  Well, you know, it's -- it's -- you know, talking about teachers, it kind of reminds me about the situation that the schools were in because they pass a lot of the -- of the black kids are the, you know -- are the lower performing kids, which are typically -- they say, you know, like seventy five percent of 'em at least around here, you know, are black or Hispanic.  And they're passing them even though they can- -- they're not passing -- they don't have the skills to go on to the next grade.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  They're passing 'em anyway because they -- they don't want that quota to show up for state funding showing that this percentage of their Afro Americans or whatever are not --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- passing.
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  You know?  So --
L:  [NOISE] I didn't know that.
R:  -- yeah, yeah.  Well, I bet the -- I bet the same thing's happening in your state too.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  But, ah -- you know, but you just don't notice it.  I've just -- I've been noticing these things because, you know, it's, ah, just a lot been going on with my husband's work and all of a sudden I've noticed all this going on.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, I think it's kind of the same idea about, like, the women breaking the glass ceilings, you know, in the corporate world --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  I think, you know -- I think it's kind of the same thing and --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- and it --
