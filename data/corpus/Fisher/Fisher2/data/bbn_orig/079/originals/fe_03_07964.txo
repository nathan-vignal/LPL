R:  My name is Sykana[?].
L:  My name is [inaudible].  Are we just -- this is my first phone call.  Um, I'm assuming we're just supposed to talk for ten minutes about the topic.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.  Um, it's my first time also.
L:  Okay.  And I think the topic was on education, if there's something wrong with the educational system.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  Um, I think there is.
L:  In what way? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] well, I believe that the children, they're our future and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the teachers -- a lot of teachers don't wanna, um, [NOISE] a lot of teachers have problems teaching the kids because of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their salary.  I don't believe teachers are getting paid enough, because they're the people who's investing into our future and they're not even getting paid that much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And to, um, deal with the kids nowadays, I believe that they should definitely be paid a lot more than what they're being paid.
L:  Mhm.  I agree with you.
R:  So ...
L:  Seems, though, that the getting paid more wouldn't necessarily make the teachers teach any better, but it would attract, um, brighter teachers, more motivated teachers perhaps.
R:  Right.  Because --
L:  It seems like --
R:  -- some teachers they just aren't motivated enough because of their salary and people aren't motivated to teach because of the salary and a, um, different things they have to deal with.
L:  I agree with you.  Uh, how do you explain, [MN] some smaller parts of the population that seem to excel academically?
R:  Um --
L:  And I guess the -- the classic example would be the Asian community, which appears to, uh, have a disproportionately large percentage of their population, um, excel academically.
R:  Well, I think it also has to do with the fact that, um, in Japan they go to school six days a week --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and here, and, uh --
L:  No, no, no, I mean, I'm sorry, uh, I just -- I'm talking about the Asian population in the United States, though.
R:  Um, [NOISE] I guess that they have more, um, motivation from --
L:  Why do you think that's so?
R:  -- um, their family.
L:  Mm. Do you --
R:  To exceed well --
L:  -- think that the teachers can teach motivation?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Do you think that teachers can teach motivation?
R:  Yes.
L:  How do you think they should go about doing that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] By supporting the kids, because sometimes children don't get the support that they need at home to succeed at school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I believe that if, um, teachers were more -- would give the children more respect that they would have, um, better motivation and would do better in school, 'cause some teachers they just, um, they -- nowadays teachers would tell a kid that they're not going to succeed or they're not going to do nothing in life.
L:  Do you think teachers tell ki- uh, students that?
R:  Yes.
L:  Interesting.  I've never experienced that, but [NOISE] I assume it happens as well, but I just haven't experienced it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you think that paying teachers more would cause that to happen?
R:  Yes, I believe, because, um, [LIPSMACK] we pay doctors, um, a large salary for, um, what they do as well as saving lives and helping to save lives and care for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, teachers are caring for the people also and they're saving lives also --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- so, um, even it requires them to go to school longer, as the doctors do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, to also increase their pay with that.
L:  Mhm.  I agree with you completely.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hm. [LIPSMACK] So, in terms of nuts and bolts, assuming that we pay the teachers more, what else would you want them to do?  You said to motivate students.  I -- I'm not sure if, um, yeah --
R:  I just think --
L:  -- as, if--
R:  -- um, the screening process for teachers, um, should be better.
L:  In what way?  Do you think that you had bad teachers?
R:  Um, in certain places I've -- I've, um, personally had bad teachers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I just think, um, it should just be, um, a stricter policy when hiring teachers.
L:  In what way? [NOISE] In wha- what would you -- how would you restrict it?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I, um, know when I experienced going to a charter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  school that a lot of the teachers weren't even certified or they were still in school --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- becoming certified while they were teaching, so, I don't believe, um, that should be allowed, I mean, I believe they should be able to assist other teachers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or maybe help them out in, um, to see how teaching really is.  I don't --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- believe that they are, um, just ready yet.
L:  Yeah.  I agree with you.  I agree with you, very much so.  But teach- the school system's [NOISE] sort of in a dilemma, they don't have enough teachers who are certified and so they're sort of putting a band aid on problems and I agree with you that if you pay the teachers more then, uh, the dropout rate for teachers would probably be much less.
R:  Or give 'em --
L:  But aside from --
R:  -- um, even the better benefits. [NOISE]
L:  That's true as well.  I agree with you with that, I -- I just, anything in general to help teachers, um, from a financial perspective, um, I think would -- or, and from a benefits perspective, I -- I think would keep the teachers in the [inaudible] -- in there.  'Cause I -- I -- I'm not sure exactly what the percentage are but I -- I think there's a very, very high dropout rate for teachers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think a lot of people start it and then realize that this isn't all it's cracked up to be [LAUGH] and then they -- then they get out.  Um, I kind of -- I personally feel that teachers are sort of out on a limb and they, uh, they're -- they're expected to do a whole lot with very little backup or resources --
R:  Right.
L:  -- either from the community or from the pa- from the families, nor from the administration.
R:  Right, and I believe that, um, [LIPSMACK] parents should also get involved more with their children --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- instead of leaving it all on teachers.
L:  I think the teachers would probably agree with you, but how would you recommend that that -- that they go about doing that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I don't know, try to get more parent involvement with their child's education.
L:  Mm.  And how would you recommend doing that?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  I don't have any good ideas, or else [inaudible].
R:  I guess --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- more --
L:  That's my [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  -- more parent teacher events.
L:  Huh.  That'd be interesting, although bu- I think when I was a kid I remember the -- all the parents were kinda grumbling about how [NOISE] uh, you know, they didn't want to come anyway. [LAUGH] I remember [inaudible] to the, um, whatever it's called, the PTA meeting?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Oh my gosh, that was one. [LAUGH] I still can remember -- remember all the grumbling about that stuff.
R:  Or make it, um, mor- make the events more exciting.
L:  Hm.  That's kind of interesting. [NOISE] I remember that, um, I was in choir when I was a kid and, um, there's -- they used to have little, um, it was like pop shows and talent shows and that sort of thing, those were always a lot of fun --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe if they had, like, uh, you know, parent teacher conferences afterwards or before, [inaudible] that might be a help.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe.
R:  Right.  Or have events -- they have events where the students have events for the teachers also, for the staff, have staff on the events.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's a good idea.
R:  Maybe cookouts or something during the summer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- during the summer months.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I would definitely agree with you, because I think that as a child I, uh, I lost out a lot by being out of school for three months.  I felt when I came back I had to kind of reinvent the wheel, so to speak.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And remember how to spell my name and everything. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  What, um, what part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm in Maryland.
L:  [NOISE] Maryland?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Baltimore?
R:  [MN]
L:  Or not Baltimore necessarily, but I mean, I -- the state of Maryland?
R:  Right, but I'm closer to Virginia.
L:  Oh.  Oh.  How is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- how do you think the school system differs in Maryland as opposed to other parts of the country?
R:  Well, I believe, um, [NOISE] in the suburbs, um, there is better teaching than in the city.
L:  Mm.  Why do you think that's so?
R:  Well, I experienced school in, um, in both atmospheres --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, just the surround -- with surrounds of school I think, um, the children feel that whi- while they're learning and teachers feel that also.  So ...
L:  Yeah, I agree with you. [SIGH]
R:  Right and what part of the country are you in?
L:  I'm in Houston, Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And actually when you were talking about physicians, I'm a physician, that's why I was kind of interested. [LAUGH] [NOISE] I can't answer your comment, though, 'cause [inaudible] yet, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I agree with you, though, I -- I think that, uh, [NOISE] that teachers are -- are by far underpaid.  Uh, how old are you, if you don't mind my asking?
R:  I'm eighteen.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How did you hear about this?
R:  Um, on the Internet.
L:  Yeah, same here actually.  I don't really know much about it at all, but, uh, they want us to talk about how the school system can be improved and where the, uh, the benefits and -- I -- I forget what the rest of the question was, I wish they'd remind us, um, hm.
R:  But I really think it does start at home, though.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I agree with you completely about that, I think that's very, very important.  Um, uh, I had asked you initially about how the Asian community -- how, um, why they make up -- they seem to be success stories almost anywhere they go, um, whether they're in, um, [NOISE] you know, relatively poor parts of town, [NOISE] or relatively wealthy parts of town.  Um, I was kinda curious as to what your perspective is on that and how, maybe their family structure is a little bit different or -- or what do you think makes that sub sector of -- of the community, uh, unique?
R:  Well, um, one, because they're not, um, actual -- they weren't actually born in America, so, um, if their parents moved over here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, um, sacri- made a lot of sacrifices --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to come over here so that they could have a better lifestyle or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I believe there's more, um, pressure on them to succeed, uh, also I think the motivation is there at home for them and the support I believe is there.
L:  Hm.  That's a really, really [NOISE] interesting perspective.  In biology there's a perspective, I think it's called, um, [LIPSMACK] I forget exactly what the philosophy is called, or what the -- what the belief went, but basically, um, you take in, uh, I forget exactly what -- basically you take, [LIPSMACK] um, of the whole population, it takes a very, very highly motivated and very, um, and ...
