R:  [NOISE] My name is Susan.
L:  Hello?
R:  My name is Susan Childress[?].
L:  Hi, my name is Cheryl.  Can you hear me?
R:  Yes, I can.
L:  Oh, okay.  Sorry, I'm in a mall -- um, so what do you think of the topic.
R:  Erm, I believe that the school system needs to have a little bit more, um, uh, discipline with the children.  Not so much as spanking them but I know when I went to school, there was discipline in the school and the parents and the law have taken the discipline away from the teachers so the [MN] -- it seems to me like the kids kinda over run the teachers now.  Instead of learning, it's just a big [NOISE] hurrah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I- I -- I think that they should be, um, able to discipline the children when they get, you know -- make a -- a [NOISE] mm -- a stink in class so that the other students are able to participate and have, [MN] you know, the learning abilities that the teacher's is trying to -- to enforce.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- oh, go ahead.
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Oh, I agree that there's, um, a lack of discipline.  I'm only out of school not too many years myself and I know that when I was in public school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was -- there were definitely a lot of times where kids were like o- -- like you say, over running the class and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- taking over and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it w- 
R:  And disrupting --
L:  -- it made it hard for the rest of us.
R:  -- the whole class.  It [MN] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  It makes work --
L:  But I also --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Oh, thanks.  But I also know that, um, there's, in a lot of districts anyway, there are, um -- there's a lack of appropriate r- classrooms for those children to go to if they -- if they have learning disabilities --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's why they're being disruptive.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, yeah, so --
R:  I agree there.
L:  Yeah, so there's a lack of those resources for sure but --
R:  But I think the children that have some kind of, um, [LIPSMACK] -- oh, I don't know if it's mental problems, maybe it's just learning disabilities and then they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they push it off and -- and it's disruptive.  I don't know if they need some special ed- classes or --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- something more appropriate for, you know, mentally challenged children that are maybe, um, attention deficit disorders or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- something.  They need special classes and maybe they need to be -- maybe more educated on how to distinguish what child needs the special learning --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- classes and which ones don't.
L:  Mhm.  Definitely.  Yeah, I think, uh -- I know that I've heard of things going on, say in New York where my mother's a teacher.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I've heard of things going on where they're cutting back on a lot of the, you know, teach a language, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- classes.
R:  The special need classes.
L:  Things like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.  And it's -- you know, it's just a matter of funds [NOISE] obviously but it's -- I don't know --
R:  But -- 
L:  -- it --
R:  -- but these children --
L:  -- seems like they need to find a way.
R:  -- are missing out.  The special ed- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the education that -- that they need is special.  And -- and they're missing out because they're just thrown in a group of maybe, you know, uh, people that are able to comprehend what the teacher's teaching better and the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- slower students are getting left behind further and further and then by the time they reach eighth, ninth grade, they're saying, "Oh, well, poop on it".  And they drop --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's where we get our little street kids.  And bless their hearts, I feel for every one of them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's just a matter of getting, you know, some special attention to those -- those students in need.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, definitely.  I don't know what can be done [NOISE] about that when we're -- you know, it's all because of funding and they don't have enough but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it seems like there has to be something that can be done because I know that even just in the regular classrooms, the teachers have like too many children at once --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a lot of the time.
R:  I agree.  I think their --
L:  I don't know what can be done about that.  They just need, I guess -- I guess, overall governmental regulations need to change maybe for --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- finances.
R:  Exactly.  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] you know, I know that I had one child in special ed- and one child not.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They were like night and day.
L:  Really?
R:  And, mhm -- and you could tell the child that needed the extra help and when she got it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when she learned something you could see her eyes light up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she was --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- thrilled she had learned this and her s- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- her other sister, you know, she was like, "I learned that years ago".  A- well, it doesn't even --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- matter.  You know, your learning comes easier to you whereas she has to struggle.
L:  Right.
R:  And you could tell when she had learned something how she would just beam, you know, "Oh, got it".  You just see her l- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- eyes just light up.  "I got it".  And --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I just think that if you --
L:  That's so great.
R:  Yeah, they just need a little bit more attention and, like you say, the -- the classes are overcrowded, the teachers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are, [MN] [MN] [MN] bless their hearts, they have their jobs, man.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Their jobs are worked out for 'em and -- and there are special teachers who sometimes give the -- the kids that they notice a little bit of extra help and -- and -- and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, maybe ask 'em to stay after school and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- kind of tutor on a little bit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more and that's great too.
L:  That's true, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But there -- there are the teachers who just go there, it seems like, to get a check.
L:  Right.
R:  And it -- yeah.  And [MN] those I'm really discouraged. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I guess it's not terribly hard at this point to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um -- to actually get in a classroom.  Er, to get a job in a classroom.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think I've h- -- I -- it used to be, I think, that you either had to be -- you had a -- had to have your masters or be working towards it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that now, I don't know, it's, uh -- it's changed a little bit.  I think you still have -- maybe have to be working towards it in some cases.  But you could also be like a -- you know, an aide or something like that.
R:  Yeah, where you just have a bachelors maybe.
L:  Right.  And people just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that probably does happen a lot where it's not really in their heart and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And maybe the teachers need some more classes.  You know how, they'll have workshops for the teachers t- for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for maybe some --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- learning to [inaudible].  Maybe they need some more classes to educate them on how to recognize the children --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- with learning disabilities and be able to work with them in the classroom.
L:  Yeah, that's a really --
R:  And -- and --
L:  -- good point.
R:  -- and include them, you know, without embarrassing them that they -- they're not doing quite as well as the other students but, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- kind of giving them a little, um, I don't know -- a little extra help to help 'em --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or something.  
L:  Definitely.  And also making sure they know like where to refer them to and things like that.
R:  Right, right and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, just some -- some extra help goes a long [LAUGH] way.  It --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it really does.
L:  Yeah, and even though the resources might be like scarce, they still --
R:  Limited, right.
L:  -- are arou- are there, yeah.
R:  But there's some teachers that are really, um [LIPSMACK] dedicated that will stay after school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And will give some of the extra students a little bit of attention, you know, and help that they need.  And that's great.  But then there are those teachers who just look over them and just carry on with the -- with the ones that are passing and they just go on.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just don't think that they're very dedicated because I know that schoolteachers don't make much money and it's probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- part of [SIGH] some of 'em's reasoning just to go in, open a book, teach what you gotta teach and get out.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  And that seems like you're just going through the motions.  You're not really helping our children.
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible] and -- and then some of the parents need to sit down with their [MN] -- with their kids and -- and help them with their homework and encourage them to learn.
L:  [MN] Yeah --
R:  And it --
L:  -- that's a big part of it too.
R:  Mhm, and -- and g- --
L:  They need to have like a structure, you know, "Every night --"
R:  Right structure.
L:  "-- we're going to sit at the table and we're gonna do the homework --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- with this person and --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know that my mom has talked to me about that.  She teaches kindergarten and, you know, even -- it's not a lot of homework for kindergarten but, um, it really needs --
R:  That's your --
L:  -- to -- you need to start it, you know, early and they learn --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- better.
R:  Kindergarten's getting you ready, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's something to ready you for your school years, I believe.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gets you all ready for your big first whole day at first grade, you know, and --
L:  Yeah, and get like good --
R:  -- learning --
L:  -- habits going and --
R:  Mhm.  And learning --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be able to, you know, uh, play with other kids, be able to associate with the other children and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not be aggressive and, you know, more assertive.  You know, it's hard for a child to understand aggressiveness and assertiveness and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and but, er, I think they can learn that if they're given the change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they really can.
L:  Mhm.  Definitely.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  No, I just said, "Definitely".
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But I just -- I don't know, teachers have a hard -- a hard job a- and -- and I think they're underpaid.  [MN] I really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really do.
L:  I think that's true.
R:  I think that they are underpaid and they're not recognized for what they're really doing to mould our children.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, wh- when we turn 'em loose, we turn 'em loose for a whole day, five days a week --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, seven months out of the year and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they have a big responsibility to take care of these children.  And -- and some of 'em do well and some of 'em don't and it's -- it's -- I don't know, what -- what can be done but it's --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- it's a problem.
L:  It's almost like you w- wanna like screen the people who are gonna be the teachers or something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but then again -- but then again there's probably a +shortage -- a shortage --
R:  Of teachers, mhm.
L:  So if you, you know -- you can't screen them if you wanna actually get enough to --
R:  If you wanna get a --
L:  -- be in the classroom.
R:  -- teacher in there.  Mhm.
L:  Right.  But I know like for my job, I work with kids who have like emotional and behavioral problems.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  And so many of them have been in public schools and had to be taken out of public schools.
R:  Ahem.  Mm mm.
L:  Um, because of those problems and we -- you know, we had a, you know -- a big interview process and training process and then, you know, we had to say --
R:  Right.
L:  -- why we wanna do this job.
R:  And then you have like work classes or something, don't you?  After, I mean, don't they just k- --
L:  Yeah, but we have training every now and then we get like, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty much, every -- ev- every other week we have a training --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for a couple of hours, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so we're always, you know, trying to keep up to date on everything and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- our therapeutic methods and things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that.
R:  And how to try to get to the children now without --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- making them feel, you know, because sometimes they feel embarrassed that they're not learning and then they'll just hush and hide --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then --
L:  Definite- --
R:  -- they won't do --
