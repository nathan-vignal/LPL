R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Good afternoon, I'm -- I'm Pat.
R:  Hi, my name's Nicole.  How are you?
L:  Okay, Nicole.  Um, movies, huh?
R:  So, the topic is, do you like going to the movies?
L:  [LAUGH] I do and I don't.
R:  Me too.
L:  I, um -- I find it so aggravating no matter how many times that they put up about, you know, not talking, or, you know, [MN] when it's a crowded theatre, you know, for a popular new movie or something --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and it just -- I don't like that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  My --
L:  So, one thing and then it's like, but then you've got to wait to rent it and then I forget the title of the movie that I want to rent --
R:  And then you never see it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And I never get to the video --
R:  And everybody tells you, "Oh, it's great -- it's great", and you --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- never get out -- Blockbuster to get it.
L:  No.
R:  Ah, the last movie I saw was, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, the one with Eminem in it ... Eight Mile.
L:  Eight Mile --
R:  Mhm.
L:  What did we see?  [NOISE] Oh, Maid in Manhattan with Jennifer --
R:  How was that?
L:  It was cute.
R:  You know, I wanted to see that.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, finally a cleanish movie.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, um, but it wasn't something I would have gone out of my way for.
R:  No.
L:  No.  I mean it was just -- you know, it was a wholesome type thing, but  I don't -- it may have dragged on --
R:  It did?
L:  -- you know, with -- you know, the premise was that, um, she was a maid, you know, she tried on an outfit, the doorbell rang, the guy answered, you know, or something, you know, she, you know -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that -- I mean, I love Jennifer Lopez.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That movie seemed to me -- that was -- would be one I'd rather rent.  I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wanna waste ten dollars a person  --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- driving, and all that waiting in line to see that.  Now Eight Mile, because there was a lot of hype about it, looked really good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I go to the movies only if the preview on television intrigues me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It has to look so good that I can't wait to see it.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And it did.
L:  Oh, usually I wait until I have a free ticket or a pass or something like that -- 
R:  Oh, free ticket would be great.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or it's a, um [LAUGH] -- um --
R:  Where do you get them at?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it's a hobby.  Do they have different promotions from different things, like --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- I can't remember what the current one is. It's something stupid.  Yeah, like --
R:  Well, that's nice.  And we just --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- ah, we have a new movie theatre where I live.
L:  Mm.
R:  They just built it, and it has like stadium seating in it, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that was one of the reasons why I did want to go and see that movie --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at that movie theatre.
L:  Now we travel, and we were down in Houston over the winter --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- in Texas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and movies there, first run, were three and three fifty a person, and I'm like, "What?"
R:  Wow.
L:  You know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's cheap.  
L:  And years and years --
R:  That's a -- that's a rental, three bucks.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, really.  And years and years ago, Marvin Hamlish[?] came to -- we were then in Buffalo, New York --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he came to Buffalo, New York for a -- a, you know, doing a show --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, he's a piano player that, you know, does all these, you know, some nice songs --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and ditties and stuff like that, and he had said that he had gone to the mall --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he says he couldn't believe it 'cause they were having like, it was like maybe a two dollar matinee presentation --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and he'd never seen that, so he paid for everybody's ticket in line and, you know, he says y- you walked up, you got the ticket and you went in the theatre and saw the movie, you didn't have to wait, so it was like --
R:  Oh, yeah, now forget it.
L:  "Yeah, well, we know where you're from".  [LAUGH] So, when you --
R:  We got there --
L:  "-- when you say what you said, I said, "Ah, you're somewhere, ah, probably around a big major city.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, um --
L:  Oh, no?
R:  -- I live in New Jersey, ah --
L:  See.
R:  -- about twenty minutes outside of Atlantic City.
L:  Well, 'cause like there, you've just said earlier about the ten dollars a ticket, you know, and --
R:  Yeah.  It's not cheap because --
L:  Most places around here are like six.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah -- well, it's -- god, it's like it's not exactly ten --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's like eight, eight fifty.
L:  That- that's fair.  Well, I can't sit like when the parents take the kids, like, you know, when they went to see Nemo and they're standing in line, here's six kids, the parents, they're all getting the popcorn on top and I'm like, "There's a hundred --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- dollars right there".
R:  Just for the movies, it's ridiculous.
L:  To the movie.
R:  And you know, the kids aren't gonna be quiet, they're not gonna sit in their seats --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and half of 'em --
L:  I know.
R:  -- are too afraid to be in the movie theatre [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause it's dark.
L:  Yeah, except --
R:  That's what happened with my girlfriend's, ah, daughter, her husband took, ah, the little girl to see, ah, One Hundred and One Dalmatians and she got scared, so they left.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, it was -- it was a waste of money really.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- probably wait until movies come out on video but, like you said, by the time they come out on video, I forget and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, life takes, you know, it goes on and you have things to do, you're cooking, you're cleaning, it's not like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I sit around the house all day and go, "Oh, am I gonna rent a movie tonight?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, ah --
L:  Well, we used to live near one that like, if you rented two movies and returned them the next day you got one free or something like, you know, it was a vicious circle.
R:  Who can watch two movies in one day?
L:  It was a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- vicious circle and then it was like, "Okay, what's the next one we're gonna rent" --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and it was like, "I don't know".  You know, and I don't have all this time.
R:  It's like why they put salted pretzels on the -- on a bar.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You eat 'em, you get salty, you drink a beer, you eat some more pretzels to absorb the beer, plus you have the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- munchies and they're salty and you have more beer.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How --
R:  But you're right, it is a vicious cycle, but really --
L:  But I --
R:  -- I -- they need --
L:  -- I know when we've gone to the movies or something like that and then I get so disappointed that like the movie wasn't what I wanted --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the time involved, you know --
R:  Duds.
L:  -- and then you go through seven promos or something like that and then you sit there and go --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- even some of the, you know -- the, you know, movie previews --
R:  The previews, yes.
L:  -- it's like, okay, well, we just watched the whole thing that was laughable about the movie because, you know, we don't need to go to see that one.
R:  Yeah, and you know in the previews they usually show you all the good parts anyway.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, it's like, "Okay, no, you don't need that one".
R:  The -- the movie before Eight Mile I went to see was, um, [LIPSMACK] the -- the vampire movie by Anne Rice, Queen of the Damned.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
R:  Now, see, I'm an Anne Rice fan --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and -- and I have her books.  I have the whole vampire chronicles and I have read that book, The Queen of the Damned, so I was so excited, I'd been waiting almost two years since the time I heard that the movie was --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- being made to the time it came out.  I was so psyched, I dragged my boyfriend, I said,  "We have to see this -- have to see it".  I got there; it was the worst movie I ever saw.
L:  Oh.
R:  It -- it was horrible, i- i- -- they -- they changed the character from the first movie, which I could -- I got used to him after halfway through, but then they changed --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- the other character, didn't even look anything like him, didn't act like him --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the movie, I understand, has to be shorter than the book, but to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- leave out such prominent details --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, not to mention in the movie that the sister has a twin --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they -- they left it out.
L:  They left it out, oh okay, that sounds like a major  --
R:  The book -- the book was --
L:  -- premise.
R:  -- twenty chapters, the movie was about four.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean that's how much information they left out.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm sitting there with my --
L:  And we went --
R:  -- my jaw -- my mouth hanging open going, "Well, what happened to this and what happened to that".  Now, my boyfriend who didn't read the book thought that the movie was pretty good --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but after the movies I said that I'm [inaudible] to the bathroom and there was a few women in there, you know, the girl standing next to me washing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- our hands and I said, ah, "What did you think", and she's like, "Queen of the Damned?" I'm like, "Yeah", she goes, "Horrible".  I'm like, "Did you read the book?"  She's like, "Yeah".  Both of us, we sat there for like ten minutes in the ladies bathroom --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- talking about the movie and -- and how bad it was because we both read the book and i- it -- the movie did the book completely no justice at all.
L:  Well, we were --
R:  Now.
L:  -- hyped about going and seeing the one with Nicole Kidman where she ta- -- plays the ugly Virginia Wolfe, um --
R:  I think I saw previews for that.
L:  -- oh, and I was like -- we walked out of there and I'm like, "Okay, what did we g- -- just see, and we paid to go see this."  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, like she --
L:  It was like --
R:  -- she played in that, um, Moulin Rouge.
L:  Yeah.  That was all right.
R:  I thought that was going to be so good, it was the weirdest movie I ever saw.
L:  Well, if you see the next one that she's in with -- she -- her and, um, oh, ah, there's three women in it.
R:  And what is she supposed to be, ugly or something?
L:  Well, yeah.  Nicole Kidman, you don't recognize.
R:  No.
L:  Honest to god, you can't -- they give her a nose that is unbelievable --
R:  Oh, Jesus.
L:  -- and they said that during the filming when she went out in the public and everything with the nose --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people didn't even give her the time of day.
R:  I guess not.
L:  But --
R:  She looked so hideous.
L:  -- and when we walked out of the movie and it was like, um --
R:  We paid to see that?
L:  -- ah, I -- yeah.  'Cause, um, Meryl Streep was in it --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but she played the, like now character --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- like of the, you know, the late two thou- -- you know, the early two thousands.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Nicole Kidman played like in the thirties --
