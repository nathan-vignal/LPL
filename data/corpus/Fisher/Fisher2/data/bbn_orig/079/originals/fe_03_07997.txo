L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hello, can you hear me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, I'm on a cell phone, so it's kind of weird.
L:  Okay.  I'm Joanie.
R:  Hi, I'm Jenny.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.
L:  Is there only --
R:  Where are you from?  You have an accent.
L:  I'm from Oklahoma.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are you really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It sounds like Australian or something.
L:  No, I'm from up north, so I kind of have a mix.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, now I hear it, it sounds different.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, I've never done one of these before.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  This is like my first one.  Yeah, my mom had me start doing this.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I don't know.
L:  Just to make some money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, ah, yeah, pretty much I think.  Well, I am from Tennyville[?], Illinois.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So, pretty far, but not too far from you, two states over.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah. Well, I just went through Illinois yesterday.
R:  Oh, did you?  What for?
L:  Yeah.  I was on the way home from Pennsylvania, that's where my relatives live.  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yep.  Stopped in Effingham[?] to have breakfast, so.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH] Ah --
R:  -- Effingham, I know Effingham.
L:  Ah.
R:  I'm right around there right now actually.
L:  Oh, really?  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  So, are we supposed to be talking about movies?
R:  I believe so.
L:  Ooh, that's a --
R:  Is that a good subject for you, or do you not watch many movies?
L:  Oh, no, I watch a lot of movies so --
R:  Do you, see I --
L:  That'll be --
R:  -- watch a few, but not very many.
L:  Oh, really?  I have a boyfriend that likes to go to movies, so I get to -- I'll have a lot to say about movies.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Well, what was the last movie you saw?
L:  Um, hm, let me think.  Boy, after I said that it's like, "What last movie did I see?"  I think it was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so bad I can't remember it, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was one of those, like, "Why did I go to this one?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know a good one was Bruce Almighty; that was hilarious.
R:  I haven't seen that, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the one with, ah, [LIPSMACK] oh, god --
L:  Jim Carrey.
R:  Jim Carrey?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, okay.  Where he like thinks he's god or something?
L:  Oh, it's so funny, 'cause you know what?  I'm not really a Jim Carrey fan, but it was worth it, after I got in there it was so funny.  [LAUGH]]
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'll have to look into that, I haven't seen it.  I don't really like going to the movie theater though --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'd rather rent a movie and bring it home.
L:  You'd rather rent it, yeah.  See I -- I do both, so I'm a pretty big movie fanatic.  [SIGH] I like the --
R:  Well -- well, what --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- movie I saw was Too Fast and Too Furious.
L:  Oh, that was a good one.  [LAUGH]
R:  I loved that movie, 'cause where I'm from -- the town I'm from -- I'm eighteen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, like, all the younger crowd is all about cars --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- in our town and everybody --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- got, you know, the imported cars that are real fast.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We have, like --
L:  They're so [inaudible] around.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we have like five car detailing places just in our town.  Like everybody's all about cars, so that was really interesting for me.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I was there to see Vin Diesel.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know, that's --
L:  He was hot.
R:  -- a shame he wasn't in that one.  Yeah.
L:  He was pretty hot in that movie.
R:  Yeah.  Paul Walker though, ooh, he's in both.
L:  The blond, yeah.  He's a babe too, but I don't -- 
R:  Yeah, he is.
L:  -- know.  I was more into Vin Diesel.  I'm older so, you know, I -- I appreciated the older man.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, I definitely, I like Vin Diesel too, but --
L:  I know, he's pretty hot.  I'm trying to think I, ah -- what movie I just saw r- recently and I really can't remember 'cause I don't think it was very good so.
R:  Mm.
L:  Oh, well, I like to go to the movies 'cause it's loud and surround sound and, you know, it's cool --
R:  Yeah, I just get real --
L:  -- even though I have a home theater at home, but, you know -- huh?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I get real fidgety.  I just -- I hate sitting like in that chair, I like to be laid out on my couch and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and --
L:  Comfortable.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't like being all confined or -- and then, like, some weird person that you don't know sitting right next to you and --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- it just -- it bothers me.
L:  And loud --
R:  I mean, I -- I --
L:  -- and doesn't shut up. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then you get like those annoying kids and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so -- so when we went and saw Fast and the Furious there were a bunch of like junior high kids behind us and --
L:  Oh, bummer.
R:  -- they thought they were something else.
L:  [MN] And they wouldn't shut up and [MN].
R:  Yeah, pretty much.
L:  Well, my boyfriend's a big huge guy so if he looks at them they shut up real fast.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well, that's good.  See, I go with a bunch of girls, I don't think we --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- look very threatening.
L:  No, I'm sure you didn't, but --
R:  :  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, he -- he's pretty laid back, but if I say, "Man, will you say something to them?" and he'll just look at them they'll shut up.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's kind of amusing, but yeah, we do both, we rent and go out so, [SIGH] you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- doesn't matter, I just like to see 'em before people talk about 'em and spoil the ending, you know?  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Yeah.  We just got satellite not too long ago so I've been watching more movies because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- we have that.  We've got a lot of different, like, HBO channels and stuff.  I --
L:  Yeah, that would be cool.
R:  -- just watched Now and Then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's kind of an older one.  I wore --
L:  Who --
R:  -- that movie out.  I've seen it, like, probably five times.
L:  Who was in that?  Who was in that one?
R:  Um, Rosie O'Donnell, um, Demi Moore.  It was the one where like they were little girls and then they grow up, you know?
L:  Oh, I don't think I've ever seen that one.
R:  And --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- like the little girl, um, Christina Ricci --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then she grows up to be Demi Moore --
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- like --
L:  -- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, I mean, it's like it's two different people, you know, but it's like they switch back and forth from like the young version to the older version and then.
L:  Yeah.  Huh.
R:  It's a really cute movie, it's all about friends and stuff.  I like it.
L:  Yeah.  You know, I don't think I ever did see that movie, I -- I'd rent it on DVD if it's pretty good.
R:  Yeah. I would definitely recommend it.  I liked it.
L:  Well, I forgot I went and saw that Hollywood Homicide is what I just saw like last -- last week, eh, it was all right.
R:  Really?
L:  It was kind of funny.
R:  I don't think I've ever heard of that.
L:  Well, it has Harrison Ford and, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- what's that guys name, from Pearl Harbor, the hottie?
R:  Yeah.  I know exactly who you're talking about, I can't think of her name.
L:  With the bushy eyebrows, you know, what is his name anyway, he -- Josh Harnett[?], is that his name?
R:  Josh Hartnett[?], yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, he was in it and it -- it was kind of funny, you know, but I don't know, kind of predictable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I -- I work full time, I have a job at a brokerage firm, and like I'll get all these women together to go see a movie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so that's kind of the reason why I see quite a few.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's fun.
L:  We go to see chick flicks, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Things the guys won't --
R:  Yeah.  I like going just, you know, to get out and stuff, but --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  If I watch a movie at home though, I usually don't end up watching it, 'cause I don't like sitting there for too long at a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- time.  I think of stuff I need to do and --
L:  Yeah. 
R:  -- unless it's a really good movie, then I'll sit there and watch it.
L:  Well, see, that's like --
R:  I don't -- have you ever --
L:  Huh?
R:  Have you ever seen, um, what's it called, The Green Mile?
L:  Yeah, that was awesome.
R:  Oh, I love that movie.
L:  I --
R:  That's really cool.
L:  -- and if I like the movies I buy them on DVD so I can watch them a hundred times, you know?  Quite --
R:  Yeah.  There's very few movies that I'll watch over and over again.
L:  Yeah.  There's, ah, very -- like, I want 'em but I won't watch 'em, that's what's stupid.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, see, I never ever buy movies because I won't watch them.
L:  Yeah, I do.  That -- see, that's what's stupid and my boyfriend yells at me like, "Why do you buy these, you don't even turn them on?"  But like there's a few like Forrest Gump, I don't know why, I think that movie's so funny, I'll watch that a hundred times.
R:  Now that's a good one.
L:  I --
R:  That's one that I could watch over and over.
L:  Oh, I'm not kidding you, I've seen that movie, like, fifty times.  I can sit there and name what he's gonna say, but it's just so stupid and so funny, it's all --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you know, I don't know.  And then I always cry --
R:  It's really interesting though.
L:  -- when she dies.  Huh?
R:  It's really interesting, you know, like how it goes through the time eras, you know.
L:  Or how he could be so lucky, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean it's totally unbelievable, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that would never happen in real life.
L:  Oh, for real, like he just happens to buy the right company stock and, yeah right, be at the right place and --
R:  Yeah, like that would ever happen.
L:  It's kind of a big fantasy trip.
R:  And he -- he gets the girl in the end and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, she dies but, ah.
L:  That was sad.
R:  That was sad --
L:  That's so sad.
R:  -- I cried so bad.  Like when he goes and visits her grave and he --
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- reads the note that the little boy wrote, oh, my god, I bawl every time.
L:  I -- I -- I know, every time I see it I still cry 'cause it's just so sad, you know, it's like --
R:  I know.
L:  -- she wasted her whole life running away from her problems, you know, and she could have --
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  -- been with mister rich even though he's stupid.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] He is stupid.  I don't blame her for not, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- hooking up with him in the beginning.  I wouldn't of.
L:  Yeah, no kidding.  [LAUGH]
R:  You gotta grow to know him to have appreciation for him I guess [LAUGH], I --
L:  [LAUGH] I guess, I don't know.  But, yeah, it's kind of funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, anyway, I'm -- I'm thinking about seeing that new movie, um, Amy and June or whatever the heck it is with Kate Hudson and that Wilson guy.
R:  Oh, is it -- are you talking about Emma and --
L:  Yeah, Emma and whatever, that looks pretty good.
R:  Yeah, I can't think of the other name, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  That's kind of a chick flick though so, you know, I'll be on my own --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- through that one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I saw The Ita- --
R:  I haven't seen a whole lot about that one, I don't really know what it's about.
L:  Oh, just this guy, he's writing and he kind of parallels it with this friend he knows and they start falling in love, I guess it's a romance story.  It looks pretty good though.  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, and, um, I just saw The Italian Job, that was pretty good.
R:  I haven't heard of that one.
L:  Yeah, and, ah, I've seen a lot.
R:  Have you seen Ghost Ship?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, the very beginning, like the first ten minutes, where the -- the wire cuts everybody in half --
L:  Oh, that was disgusting.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that was like the best, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- after that like I thought like, "This movies probably not going to be that great", you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- after I saw that I'm like, "This movie is awesome", and --
L:  Ah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- then it -- that made me like sit there, but the rest of it wasn't like that great, it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just had that really cool scene at the beginning that like got you hooked and then you were waiting for something else really cool.
L:  And then you're waiting for it to get better, yeah. --
