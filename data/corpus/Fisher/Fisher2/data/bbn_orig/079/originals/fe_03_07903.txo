R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes, hello.  How are you doing?
L:  Oh, hi.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.  And how long do we have for this to ?
R:  Ten minutes.
L:  Ten.  Okay.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you could start.  What do you -- what would you do?
R:  Um, I would probably more likely take the million dollars 'cause, uh --
L:  Yeah, 'cause friends are fickle.  I mean, you never know what's gonna happen with the friend and I have to think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right now, "Who's my best friend?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if you have to think that hard anyway --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, and the reality is that never talk to your best friend again, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  How would the benefactor -- so, you just find a -- I mean, that's a l- -- I'm sure the best friend would probably   Okay, well how about this; [LAUGH] it didn't -- he didn't -- it doesn't say you can't write.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It doesn't say that you can't meet the person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and have lunch and not talk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you can tell the person, "I can't talk to you, but I ", you know, you -- and theref- -- and you'd have enough money to learn sign language.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, it's -- it leaves it kind of wide open what it says.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so how -- what would your letter say to your friend? [LAUGH]
R:  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'd probably say, you know, "I'd still like to stay in touch and, you know, communicate, you know, however we can but, you know, from time to time".  The only reason I would take the money is to, you know, kind of catch up on my bills and try to use the money, you know, kind of wisely to start a, you know, a business on the side.
L:  Or you could give the friend a couple of hundred bucks.
R:  Some mo- -- yeah.
L:  The friend would understand.
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  I mean, now if the -- anonymous[?] benefactor said, "You cannot tell the friend about this.  We're gonna fabricate, you know, a reason why you're mad at the friend".  I mean, that -- that would, you know, that would cause some complications.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it just says that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't t- -- so I mean, that, you know.  Now, do -- w- where's your best friend?
R:  Uh, do I have one?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually I really don't have a best friend.
L:  Isn't that funny?  I think that's more what they're trying to aim at.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] That's prob- -- yeah.  So, okay, well we can't talk about those.  W- what area are you in?
R:  I live in the Houston area --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in Texas.  Where you living at?
L:  Los Angeles.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  Well, yeah, I think, you know, I mean, I'd -- I'd have to -- let's see I'm trying to think, um, and what else did it say?  It asked us what we would -- if -- what we would -- if we would -- did it ask anything else?
R:  Mm mm.  That's the only thing they asked about.
L:  Okay, so we're supposed to go the full ten minutes, right? [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, and they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gonna cut in.
L:  Enormous benefact- -- anonymous.  It says anonymous benefactor, hypothetically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I certainly -- you know, I mean, I'm trying to think too right now, best friend.  Who is the best friend?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, well, you know, I have someone -- I mean, I think my best friend would probably unders- -- my, you know, then you have to say, "Well, would the -- what would the best friend do?" 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the best friend, one I -- the one I can think of [MN], you know, she would probably take the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, I mean, I could say, "Well, I will meet you at such and such a place but we can't talk.  There's no way.  We cannot speak.  Where there's no words can be said --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, only sign language and letters and we can write things".  So, you know, [LAUGH] that's probably what we could do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And then, um, oh, well I guess -- so, uh, I guess I would.  You know, that's what I would do.  Now, [MN] what, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  Have -- have -- how many calls have you made?  Have you been doing many calls with the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Fisher study?
R:  No.  
L:  Ok- --
R:  This is my first time.  I did [COUGH] -- excuse me.  I did other surveys but it was here in Houston.  I did it like in a [inaudible] --
L:  Okay, 'cause this is -- I mean, they go ten minutes on this one.  I'm trying to think what else   Um, so what does this bring up for me?  Um, hypothetical situation here now.  I mean, what's the likeliness of someone doing it 'cause it's just hypothetically and then, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, what would you do with the million dollars?
R:  Mm --
L:  You said a business?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kind of business?
R:  Oh, helping disability people.  You know, advocate for, you know, children that need service in school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you?
L:  Uh, what would I do with the -- the million?  Yeah, I'd invest it in a business as well.  A trade school.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I'm in Los Angeles area.  I'm in the, um -- I work in, um, [LIPSMACK] visual and performing arts and production and whatnot --
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah, and I've done that my whole life.  Working on, you know, both ends of the -- both ends of the camera and whatnot so I'd probably have some --
R:  Mm.
L:  Some kind of trade school, you know, that would, um, definitely be very, very, um, [SIGH] uh, I don't want to say prolific or, um, [MN] you know, very productive in -- in actually doing projects with the students towards their --
R:  Mm.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah, to -- yeah --
L:  The end of their, uh, terms and whatnot.  'Cause a lot of the schools -- I mean, you know, a lot of the schools there -- there are a lot of things done but try and keep it more multi media.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, 'cause we have film schools and we have acting schools but I don't know if there really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is one that kind of, you know, brings it all together.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, they may but, you know, so maybe try and do something like that so I can keep my fingers kind of in all areas 'cause I'm not getting any younger out here.
R:  Uh-huh.  Don't feel --
L:  Um, so that's -- huh?
R:  Don't feel bad.  You're not -- you're not by yourself on that.
L:  Well, you know, I mean, it's all relative, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's probably what I would do with it 'cause, you know, and maybe -- maybe with an emphasis on k-, um, you know, disabled --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, students maybe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, um, I may -- uh, I know, um, k- -- a few disabled people and I'm kind of fighting a few things myself right now.  So, you know, just --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- always good to be able to, you know, help people out and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- make things a little easier and, you know.  So, um, that's probably what I would do with it.  But first I'd take a trip around the world.
R:  Mm.  Well, I would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- take a trip.  I don't know about round the world though.
L:  Well, that's true.  Not with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's going on now. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're right.
R:  You know, I c- -- I can, you know, go so far and I come right back.  I'm a -- you know, I wouldn't mind going somewhere --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- different.
L:  Yeah, I'd like to maybe go, um, [LIPSMACK] definitely go, [SIGH] you know, to -- to European, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- countries.  France and Italy and [NOISE] whatnot and, you know, as far as the Middle East if you're just gonna kinda like fly over [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't need to st- -- I don't need to stop. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  And, uh, but the Orient as well.  You know, I'd like to go --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the Orient and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, the f- -- you know, maybe the friend could go but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we just can't talk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's all there is to it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it just says you can never talk to the friend again and so it didn't say can't see, can't talk.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, now friend we just, you know -- I mean, that would be so hard to not -- to be with anyone and not talk but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hey, for a million bucks.  Now, what is it?  How many million?
R:  I -- I think it was a million bucks -- bucks or something.
L:  What's that dear?
R:  I think it's a thousand bucks or something like that.
L:  No, it said something in the millions.
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  Didn't it say?  It said --
R:  Something like that.  So --
L:  Yeah, it said something --
R:  You know, whatever they give to me I'll take it and run with it and [inaudible].
L:  It said something -- it said something in the millions like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- four million or something.  You know. 
R:  Something like that.
L:  So, uh, yeah.  So, that's a l- -- I mean, that's a lot.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely have a m- -- you know, a budget to be able to do a, you know, a movie or some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kind of a definite, you know, up -- upscale project.  Of course four million's nothing for a million but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I've worked on movies that they've done for three million that've been huge budgets and   I mean, that -- that have looked like, you know, a lot of money but, you know, three million's -- and when you think about it, you know, when you're doing, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- something [SIGH] in production --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's not -- not that much but still, I mean, I -- I -- I don't think I've ever seen that much. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  Not too much.  And they're gonna -- so they'll cut in on us?
R:  Yeah.
L:  With a real voice or -- oh, just --
R:  Of the -- it's like the -- the, um --
L:  Recorded thing.
R:  Recording --
L:  Sh- -- but we should go up until then, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  We just keep going.  So --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
L:  [SIGH] So, it --
R:  It's nice talking to you and [NOISE] I've been enjoying it.
L:  Will -- will they cut in or do we need to continue?
R:  We c- continue.  They supposed to have cut in.
L:  Okay, and they'll just butt in.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, would you buy any --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- clothes?
R:  Uh, yeah.  I would buy some clothes and probably buy me a car to get around 'cause I live in the city of [NOISE] Houston and it just like  [NOISE] I need a car to get around. [NOISE] I'd buy me a beat up car until I can [NOISE] do better.  What is it? [NOISE] Yeah, you gonna go.  You just need to be patient, okay?
L:  Who's that, your kid?
R:  Yeah, my son.
L:  How old's he?
R:  He's fourteen and he's just ready [NOISE] to go -- yeah, you gonna get the school bus and you're gonna see Matilda and Marilyn, okay?  Um, now he's --
L:  He goes to   oh --
R:  He's a --
L:  So, would you -- you'd buy some clothes?
R:  Yeah, clothes and, you know, oh, a -- a car to just to get around and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Stuff like that.
L:  Well, I mean, with that kind of money, you know, you'd have to take a few thousand dollars and do something for yourself.
R:  Yeah, I would, you know, buy, uh, something that -- you know, like a car or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just that I really need [NOISE] right -- right now and -- and try to invest it and [NOISE] start a comp- -- [NOISE] yeah, she's coming. [NOISE] Matilda's coming, okay?  Yeah, I'm on a call, okay?  Yeah, you're gonna get the school bus.  Okay? [NOISE] 
L:  What's the school -- oh, okay.
R:  Oh, it's a school bus.
L:  Oh.
R:  He's going to camp [inaudible] for the summer.
L:  Okay.  So, then --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  You could start your own camp, right, with that kind of money?
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So, yeah, that -- that -- I'd buy some clothes.  I probably would buy a car too then.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  I guess I would 'cause I don't have one --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right now.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm just -- you know, I'd probably buy a nice, you know --
R:  I'm going.  You wanna -- yeah, when it's time to go up in the front I'll take you, okay?  You lay there and rest, okay? [NOISE] Uh-huh.  I'm sorry. [LAUGH] 
L:  That's okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, definitely some clothes.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, I --
