L:  Hello.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello. [MN]
L:  Yes, where are you from?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] my name's Lydia and I live in Seattle, Washington.
L:  Wow, Lydia from Seattle, my name is Vince Calisi, I am a, [SIGH] um, father I live in [NOISE] Sandusky, Ohio, here in -- off of Lake Erie, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I'm single. [LAUGH]
L:  My, uh, my sister actually works for the city of, uh, Seattle.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, uh, she was just here about two weeks ago --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- so, I -- I -- [NOISE] I know a little bit about Seattle then.
R:  So, have you been out to visit yet?
L:  No, I wish I did, but --
R:  Well, you --
L:  -- uh --
R:  -- should come right now, we have a really good hot spell, it will probably last another hour or two --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- we've had --
L:  Oh, a hot spell --
R:  -- a good week.
L:  -- that'll last an hour, huh?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, we're l- we're lucky if it lasts a week and we've actually had quite warm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- temperatures for the last two days, so --
L:  [NOISE]  h, that's good to know.  What do you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do for a living?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I'm a librarian at a youth detention center --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I work with kids in lock up.
L:  Okay, so then maybe you could talk a little bit about affirmative --
R:  affirmative --
L:  -- action --
R:  -- action. [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the workplace.
R:  Yeah.  There's actually a lot of African American and, um, [LIPSMACK] Asian American people that work, um, with the kids in youth detention --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and is a hi- very high [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [SIGH] lot of African American kids [LIPSMACK] and also Asian American kids, you know, that, um, end up getting, you know, brought in, so --
L:  Yeah.  Now --
R:  -- where they're not --
L:  -- now, um, I am a restaurant manager and I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- don't know what you know about, um, Ohio, but on the, uh, on Lake Erie in Ohio there's an amusement park, it's called Cedar Point --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, we're -- we're fairly [MN] known for our world record breaking roller coasters, if --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- you're into that and I manage a TGI Fridays restaurant [NOISE] and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it just so happens that I do manage not only African American individuals, but we are also involved in -- in -- an employment exchange program that brings in employees from Europe [NOISE] and Colombia --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- um, [NOISE] mostly Colombia and, uh, the eastern, uh, what was the Eastern Bloc countries, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Russian and so forth.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, so, um, am I involved i- in affirmative action?  No, but I definitely have a huge diversity of em- employees that work for me.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And does it make life better?  It certainly makes it more interesting, I'll tell you that.
R:  I bet.
L:  I don't know if it makes it any better, so --
R:  I think it makes it, oh, wo- the word is different, but I mean, because there's pluses and minuses --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess.  Um, it really depends on how open minded people are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, um, [SIGH] I mean I'm -- I actually grew up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in Canada --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- where, um, [LIPSMACK] and s- I'm, um, I guess my parents just always taught me, like, the color of a person's skin or -- or their ethnic origin really does not matter per se or, you know, what their accent is.
L:  Right.
R:  I find it really interesting 'cause y- um, though I work only with the staff of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one other librarian and the library assistant, mm, the, [SIGH] um, library that I belong to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it has, um, eleven hundred employees and there's actually a accent reduction class and a, um, accent and it's, like, so you can take classes on reducing your accent you're -- you can speak clearer and I never know how I feel about that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like, I mean, [SIGH] that's your accent, that's part of you, it's almost like they're saying, "No, no, you ne- need to be able to speak better" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I guess enunciation so, you know, people can understand but still, [SIGH] I don't know, I have problems with that a lot.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, the who- it's like, no, no, I mean if they're from, you know, South America or Central America --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I mean, I guess it's totally up to them, but I don't think the, uh, business --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- should be pressuring, like, "No, your accent is too thick", I mean I think it should be if the employee says, "I find --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- that, um, [MN] I have a hard time talking with the library users, can I take this class?" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's one thing, but I don't think that library supervisors should be saying, you know, "No one can understand you, you need to take this class", so --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It's not right and [SIGH] I don't think so- someone should be hired or promoted just based totally on their s- ethnic, you know, I don't believe in, like, you know, affirmative action in colleges or anything, "Oh, you know, we don't have enough, you know, of this minority", I think it should just be, I don't know --
L:  But --
R:  -- based on kind of merit and abilities --
L:  Right, now did you hear that there's sort of like a split decision in the Supreme Court about the, [NOISE] um, the Michigan, uh, [NOISE] uh, Michigan school, um --
R:  No.
L:  -- yeah, it's just recent, there's, uh, uh, information about the affirmative action in one of the -- the -- the state schools in Michigan where they already have an affirmative action policy where they admit students based on their ethnicity --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and the Supreme Court has ruled on that and I do --
R:  Maybe --
L:  -- believe that --
R:  -- I have heard something about this, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I do believe they've ruled in favor of the -- the college to an extent.
R:  Huh.
L:  Um, and -- and I guess, you know, in [NOISE] what they're trying to say is that they want to, uh, [NOISE] maintain a diverse educational background. [NOISE] So, I -- I don't know how that works out in the -- in [NOISE] the world, but, uh, um, you know, for us, [NOISE] the most difficult thing for me is, you know, overcoming, um, cultural [NOISE] and [NOISE] uh, vocabulary, you know, the language barrier so the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people that work for me, [NOISE] 'cause they all come to the United States a- and I'm -- I'm mostly speaking about, you know, my folks from South America and from, you know, Eastern +Europe [NOISE] where, you know, uh, they have nothing and they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- come here and they -- they can earn ye- uh, the American dollar and it's worth two, three, four times where -- what they can earn --
R:  Exactly, and they s-
L:  -- and they --
R:  -- probably send a lot -- do they send a lot of it home?
L:  Uh, well, I think they do --
R:  Do you know?
L:  -- save a lot here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, in the banks here in United States and then, um, they just take it with them, you know, on paper, basically --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- 'cause if they have it in cash, then -- well, actually I'm not sure how they do it.  One way or another they get s- they get messed up for the taxes because in some --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- si -- situations if they have, uh, real proof of their earnings they would get taxed pretty significantly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I don't know, it just makes our lives real interesting here in -- in northern Ohio at this amusement park with all our European people.  It's certainly not a policy of affirmative action, but, you know, by all means it certainly broadens our hor- our educational horizons.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't know --
R:  So, like, are there, um, community -- do you se- see that there are strong communities, like, within the neighborhoods, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, are the different, like, um, you say Colombian and European --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- especially Eastern European?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Uh, well, tho- those that come from, um, Colombia --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and -- and the various countries in Europe, they all tend to kind of click together, you know? [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  They -- they kinda group together and they kinda stick together, but, um, they -- they all tend to want what we have --
R:  Of -- yeah.
L:  -- basically, they -- they -- and they --
R:  Well, they --
L:  -- work.
R:  -- see --
L:  They work many hours a week.  We sort of have a cap on how many hours they can work a week --
R:  I was --
L:  -- which is --
R:  -- about to say, but then do they go in other restaurants?
L:  Um --
R:  And try getting another --
L:  -- they do --
R:  -- shifts there?
L:  -- they do, but because we're one big company here --
R:  Mhm, oh.
L:  -- um, we kinda have kept a control on it and we, [NOISE] you know, we have a cap of, like, seventy hours a w- a week that we'll let anybody work, so sometimes they get frustrated with that, but, you know, the crazy thing is most Americans, [NOISE] they don't want to work more than forty, forty five hours [LAUGH] a week.
R:  I know.
L:  You know, like, "I'm not working any longer than that" and these guys, they want to work forever. [NOISE]
R:  They -- they love it.  They go for it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, well, they're -- [NOISE] what I've --
R:  Well, they --
L:  -- learned -- what I've learned is [NOISE] they can earn a lot of money here in the summertime and then they go home [NOISE] and they --
R:  [SIGH] Oh.
L:  -- they're, uh, they're definitely [NOISE] doing well financially. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, so they're very seasonal?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we [NOISE] you know, just -- w- we have pretty much just the summertime, you know, May --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- through -- through August type, uh, season here and -- [NOISE] and that's when they come in. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] And then you ha- so do you mostly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, Caucasians that get you -- or people that are resident -- resident Ohio -- Ohioans? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  That get --
L:  -- that's -- that's --
R:  -- you for the rest of the -- the year then?
L:  Uh, very much so, um, the amusement park is really only open from May through October --
R:  Oh, so what do --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- you do the rest of the year?
L:  Uh, i- that's --
R:  If I may --
L:  -- a good --
R:  -- ask?
L:  -- question.  We actually do a lot of planning, we have a nice, uh, a holiday break during Thanksgiving and Christmas, but as soon as we return in January we are hiring, re- re- reworking manuals [NOISE] and, uh, getting ready to -- to ...
