R:  Hello, I'm Pamela.
L:  Hi, ah, Lydia.
R:  Hi Lydia.  So, would you take a million dollars?
L:  Well, [LAUGH] do you want the truth?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] I think I might.
R:  Oh, yeah, [LAUGH] I would, too.  
L:  And, I think I say that partly because at this moment I don't have, like, a best, best friend.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, I mean, I could always do something really nice for that person --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the money.
R:  And -- and I say I'd take it because I had a best friend, and, all of a sudden we're not speaking any longer, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- like, I might as well have a million dollars --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, sometimes I think words just get in the way, anyway.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, they didn't say we couldn't see the person.
L:  [NOISE] And, once you got the money -- what --
R:  Pardon me?
L:  -- what can -- once you have the money, what can you do -- what can they do?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  If you do speak to that person.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well, I -- I think I would definitely not speak to the person, 'cause I believe in the karma thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  I --
L:  -- I believe in karma, too, but, um ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I might see them, and just, you know, like, maybe dance or smile, or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and it doesn't say that you couldn't write to the person.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So -- I --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- I've actually been on hikes with a good friend of mine, and we promised each other that we would not speak deliberately for the entire hike, just so, you know, we could just really enjoy the hike more, and -- and it was pretty cool.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE] Well, I wasn't too sure about this subject, I almost [NOISE] decided not to, um [NOISE] -- to participate in this call.
R:  Oh, really -- how come?
L:  Well, because they said the subject was anonymous benefactors, and, um, [NOISE] hyp- -- well, first they said hypothetical situations, and then anonymous benefactors, and that just sounded too vague, I mean, I was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I couldn't think of anything I could possibly say about it, really.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, it reminds me of the, ah, movie --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe you saw that with Demi Moore? 
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ah, that was quite an interesting movie, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, that was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little bit different --
L:  But, you know, I think the re- -- they kinda copped out on that movie [NOISE] because, um, [NOISE] you know, [MN] American's have kind of a [NOISE] -- a -- a puritanical view, like, they had to make her be [NOISE], you know, miserable --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think [NOISE] -- in reality I just think maybe it would of ended differently.  [NOISE] I mean, I know at the end it was a l- -- you know, kinda hopeful, because they did [NOISE] get back together, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I wonder if culture has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has something to do with it, like, if you asked this question to people in different countries if they'd have a different response than Americans. 
L:  [NOISE] Well, I think Europeans are a little more [NOISE] open minded a lot of times --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- than we are.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think so, too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  A million dollars, yeah, I -- I'd definitely take that.
L:  [NOISE] Well, it -- I mean, I'm -- I'm broke, so, [NOISE] you know, a million dollars would, I mean, they say money can't buy you happiness, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] the people that say that have money, so ... [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and it's pretty hard to be --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- well, I guess you could be happy without it, but it just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, there are just so many things to do and explore on the planet.
L:  Well, I mean, I've been -- I've been homeless -- I've been, you know, where I didn't have anything [NOISE], so, I mean, [NOISE] money does afford you [NOISE], you know, the chance to be comfortable --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you can't get by without it, so ... [NOISE]
R:  So, how did you get out of the homeless situation?
L:  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] just [NOISE] kept trying to, um [NOISE] -- kept fighting it.  I mean, I was never really, like, on the street, but, you know -- where I -- I didn't have a place to call my own -- I had to stay in a shelter [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, where I live they have [NOISE] -- I live in Seattle and they have some, ah --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- [NOISE] opportunities, you know, I mean, some cities they don't really do a lot for people, but, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Seattle is pretty good about that.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I'm in Seattle as well.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  But, I --
L:  Well -- well, this is my third call and my other two -- when -- the first one was from New York, and the second one was from LA.  [NOISE] 
R:  Ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I wanna stay on the topic --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, we make sure we get -- at least get ten dollars -- [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] than a million --
L:  But, it's pretty hard [inaudible] --
R:  -- but, at least we'll get ten.  So, what do you think?  Would you, ah, not speak to your best friend for five hundred thousand?
L:  [NOISE] Probably.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah?  Two hundred and fifty thousand?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, yeah, I mean, even, I don't know -- a hundred thousand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, then what would you do with the money?  And, would you feel bad at all, like, if you were in a nice house and everything with that million dollars -- do you think you'd have any resentment later on?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, [MN] yeah, most likely, but, you know, I have a child, and [NOISE] the money would -- would sure go far to help him out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, you know, I [NOISE] -- I wanna provide the best for him that I can and -- [NOISE] and, ah, give him opportunities, so, my loyalty is to him most of all.  [NOISE] 
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, I can't remember what they say it costs to raise a child now, but, it's, ah, at least a coupla hundred thousand.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, [MN] undoubtedly, I'm sure it's more than that [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not -- and I'm sure that doesn't include college.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Now, if they asked the question, "Would you, you know, divorce your husband, or leave your lover?", I think my answer would be different.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I don't have one at the moment, but, you know, thinking of the father of my son, I -- I would [NOISE] -- I would change my answer.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, so, it's different between a friend and a lover?
L:  Well, I mean, I always say that, like, lovers come and go, but, friends last forever, and -- and I [NOISE] -- I hate to [NOISE] -- I mean, I don't -- I don't wanna say that a friendship isn't important to me, but, um [NOISE], you know, [inaudible] -- theoretically speaking, I think I would choose a million dollars.  [NOISE]
R:  And, have you ever noticed how friends kinda come and go, depending on where you're at in life, and -- and what youre doing -- my whole set of friends has really changed a lot with every specific chapter of my life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you know, you're gonna lose 'em anyway, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, chances are that -- that has happened to me.  [NOISE]
R:  And, you know, whenever you lose something, something better comes in it's place is what they say.
L:  [NOISE] Well, that's a nice [NOISE] -- I would like to think that, but, I, ah -- it's not always the case.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it has been for me -- I've noticed that everytime I lose something, something better comes along --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's really encouraging, because everytime I think, "Well, it can't get any better than this", it does, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's a -- that's a nice reminder to myself, just to hear myself say that.
L:  [NOISE] Well, you're a very lucky person then.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I've kinda learned to change my thoughts and it's amazing how powerful that can be.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I agree with you, it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, it's hard to [NOISE], you know, to do that when [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] you can't [NOISE] -- can't get anywhere in life, and -- and, ah, you feel frustrated with your situation, and [NOISE] -- and it is hard to, you know, be optimistic and positive in light of that.  [NOISE] You know, I try --
R:  Well, I --
L:  -- but, um, [NOISE] I am pretty discouraged at this point.
R:  One thing I've always done, is I just go to the local library and read biographies, because it seems like every single great person -- you read about just this traumatic, really, really tough situation they've been in ...
