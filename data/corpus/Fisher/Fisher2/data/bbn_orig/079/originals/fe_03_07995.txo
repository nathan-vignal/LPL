L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, um, my name's Louise and I'm from Massachusetts.
L:  And I'm Tina from eighty four Pennsylvania, which is near Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's south of Pittsburgh.  How are you today?
R:  I'm fine thanks, how are you?
L:  Fine, have you gone to the movies lately?
R:  Ha, um, ooh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- probably within the last three months, but probably only once.
L:  That's about what I'm going for, but although I am a true movie buff I tend to -- I enjoy them here at my home.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Ah, how about you?
R:  I do to, yeah, either -- either on TV or sometimes we'll, ah -- we actually go to our local libraries a lot and they --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- have, ah, a lot of movies [MN]  that you can just take out for free.
L:  [MN] The reason -- it isn't so much, well, it is for the free too, don't get me wrong, but it's also the fact that I love movies so much that I want the details, I want to be able to view it, like, just -- just an example, I was -- the last movie I saw was Matrix Two.
R:  Oh, well, you've been to the movies then since me [LAUGH] 'cause I think I --
L:  [LAUGH] Well, but I was very tired and I did not like the very beginning of it and then I kind of got into it.  My husband is very much into The Matrix --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, ah, when I got out I had a lot of questions for him and it ends quite abruptly, 'cause we know that there's another one coming --
R:  That there's another one, yep, yeah.
L:  -- but that didn't bother me as much as it was so slow in the beginning and it wasn't my kind of movie.  I don't know if you've seen The Red Violin --
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  -- oh Louise, I've got goose bumps again.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It takes place -- did you see Frida?
R:  No, I di-
L:  I haven't either, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, that's all right -- that's all right.  The two movie- -- I didn't see either, except at home.  Frida I haven't seen yet, but Frida is like going to a museum, it's like being alone, a couple of people, ah, in the museum and you can walk up to the p- -- actual painting without somebody saying, "Stand back three feet, don't breathe".
R:  Wow.
L:  Well Frida is so beautiful, the pictures come to life in the movie --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and it's -- it's just unbel- -- I have not seen it, I've only seen clips --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but it just came out on DVD, which I don't have, but I have a tremendous library of VHS, and I did just buy another one, ah, here it is sitting by my computer and it's called, ah, The Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, it's a Clint Eastwood movie.
R:  Clint Eastwood one, yeah.
L:  Did you see it?
R:  No, I haven't heard --
L:  Well.
R:  -- of that one, I've heard of most of his.
L:  Three ninety nine at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I can't remember where because we don't go shopping either too much.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've both been so busy, but I got it and only because for three ninety nine I want to sit here, it's not opened yet, we've had it about two months, I want to sit when I can look at it and pick it out and be picky and, oh, look at that red vase or look at that thing or look at that piece of furniture, boy wouldn't that be great or the re- -- that's good and The Red Violin, I think it's two thousand years of the trace of a violin.
R:  Mm.
L:  And it -- it's called The Red Violin, it has Samuel Jackson in it, and I'm not going to tell you what happens but he plays a part in the end, and oh my god he is fantastic.
R:  Oh, how's that, I'll have to keep my eyes open for that one.
L:  Right.  The Red Violin, and what was the other one that I've got?  I've got Amadeus, now that I did see in the theater, but I'll tell you what, it's dark and the theater was light, you know what I mean, they had --
R:  Oh, y- --
L:  -- the lights on --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- and, ah --
R:  So- some movies I think are great to watch, like, ah, what was the -- the last one I saw at the theaters was the, um, the new -- the newer Lord of the Rings one --
L:  Oh yes.
R:  -- and because it's just got so much -- I -- I think I bought the DVD for it too afterwards or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that I could look at it again at home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, it just had the -- the -- the -- the -- the big screen, some --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- movies, like, ah, Star Wars kind of things are great on a big screen --
L:  On a big screen, right.
R:  -- because you get, yeah, so much, and my screen at home, I -- I don't have a --
L:  What size do you have?
R:  I -- I have, like, a twenty five inch screen.
L:  Oh see, we're graduating now, I'm at a twenty seven and believe it or not it cost me seven hundred dollars, like ten years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or maybe twelve years ago.
R:  And now you can get them for a song.
L:  For a song, and I s- -- but I want -- I won't go unless I get a thirty five.
R:  Yeah, I have -- I have cousins who have all gone up to the thirty something inch TVs and I have an entertainment center that'll only take up to a certain --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- up to what I have right now, so --
L:  You're funny, yeah.
R:  -- if I -- if I'm going to go up higher I gotta -- I gotta change --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my entertainment center.
L:  But see, I'm like you, if it's a big screen thing and if I think this is unreal, if I think the theater's not going to be so crowded I will go --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and I tend to go during the week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, my husband isn't a movie buff except when it comes to, ah, big screen epics, like he -- he loves the one we both saw, what'd you say before, ah Lord --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- of the Rings.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, that trilogy, he's read it as a kid growing up and then read it again in college and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- then read it again, so -- and we went down, we live in Pi -- Pittsburgh, as I told you, south of Pittsburgh, we were -- my daughter lived in Ohio, the bottom of Ohio in Tennessee, so she read me, we had the tapes and I had to hear them all the way --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- down, so when the movie came this engineer said, "I had to see it".
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But I didn't view them the way the movie did, I viewed them as tiny little people, you know, real tiny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I enjoyed it.  I will say I did enjoy the movie.  I like going to the movies, I just, as you said, we don't go too often.
R:  Yeah, I think i- it's -- it's nice at home too if you're -- I have three kids, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- fourteen and under, so just --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- the idea of, you know, going out to a movie is just not really in my life --
L:  In your style, right now.
R:  -- plans right at the moment, yeah.
L:  Now, did you see Nemo?
R:  I have not seen that one, no.
L:  No.  No, but that's good to take the kids to.  My grandchildren are coming up in about three weeks and they've seen it.  They go to a camp that they do so much during the camp --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- but, ah -- in Florida -- but they've seen it but they want me to go with them because, "Grandma you will enjoy it", and you know what, I think I will.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The thing about that though, [SIGH] in the theater they had this mobile hanging and I said, "Oh, where can I buy that?" you know, and she says, "Oh no, you have to go on Ebay", and I said "You know, that's the kind of thing that a lot of kids might like in their room", you'd think they would sell those --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- as opposed to some of this other stuff --
R:  Yeah
L:  -- that they're selling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, but my husband travels a great deal so he's -- we wanted to see Schmidt, couldn't wait for Schmidt --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and he saw it on the plane coming home from California and he said, "Not good", but then I thought I'll like it [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if he didn't like it, I'll --
R:  I'll like it, yeah.
L:  -- like it.  Oh, yeah, but you gotta remember Frida --
R:  Frida.
L:  -- now if you have the DVD, it did just come out on DVD, and that's with Salma Hayek and Ed Norton and Gabe -- see, I know movie stars, I'm --
R:  Wow, yeah.
L:  -- crazy, from when I was a kid.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  The first movie that I saw was The Red Shoes --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've heard of that one.
L:  -- and that's with Moira Shearer.  Beautiful, oh, that's all -- if you like that kind of s- -- loving story about a ballerina who -- her shoes take her away from her love.
R:  Yep.
L:  And it -- with, ah, Goring, oh my god, that made such an impression.  And I once heard Martin Scorsese say that the movie that, when he was about eight years old, this is going to date both of us, he saw The Red Shoes and he knew he wanted to make movies.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But what kind of movies do you like when you go?
R:  Um, I'm pretty -- ah, pretty much, ah, like just about anything.  I mean, I guess my -- I like -- depend- on my mood, I like a -- you know, a good -- a good comedy is always nice --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  Did you like the Jerry Lewis movies?
R:  Um, yeah.  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean I haven't actually seen one of those actually in years and years --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- um, but like good ad- -- good adventure --
L:  Movies.
R:  -- action kind of things are --
L:  Uh-huh.  How about Robin Hood with Sean Connery and, ah --
R:  Yes, oh, yes.
L:  Oh, wasn't it -- and -- and what about Sean Connery and Richard Gere?  Oh, my god, in that, ah -- where he plays the knights of the round table.  Oh, what's that?  Rob- -- no it wasn't Rob- -- king -- king, ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  Something like that.
R:  Yeah.  I think I -- I think I know which, ah, one you're talking about --
L:  You know what --
R:  -- I've seen that, um --
L:  How about Sean Connery in --
R:  Yeah, I love Dustin Hoffman --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- movies, he's, ah, in, ah -- you know there's certain actors, you know that if they do a movie it's generally it's going --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to be an entertaining movie.
L:  Yeah.  Did you watch the A.F.I. on Robert DeNiro?
R:  A.F.I., no.
L:  That was about two weeks ago, oh.
R:  Oh, yeah, I think I -- yeah, I did see that in the paper.  I -- between my work --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- schedule and stuff I -- I don't actually -- 
L:  It's hard, yeah.
R:  -- even watch a lot of TV anymore --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I used to -- used to when my kids were that much younger, but now it's -- I --
L:  It's while you're running and going with the kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do they tend to go to movies more?
R:  [MN] Not really --
L:  Not really?
R:  -- like sometimes, you know, because it gets -- for us, it -- it gets, if-- if we're to go as a family of five, I mean, it gets --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- very ex- -- very expensive --
L:  Well, that's like my daughter --
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  -- so, they tend to go to their library in Delano[?], in Deland[?], Dubarry[?], Dubarry, near Dayton- -- ah, Daytona, they have a fantastic li- --
