L:  [LIPSMACK] Hello, my name is Jack Holdsburg.
R:  Um, hi, my name is Deborah.
L:  Hi, Deborah.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Jupiter, Florida.
R:  Oh, wow, we're just about opposite ends. [LAUGH]
L:  And where are you?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I live in -- on Vancouver Island, which is just by Seattle.
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a beautiful country up there.
R:  It is.  It's --
L:  I'd -- a --
R:  -- really nice.
L:  -- are you affected by affirmative action up there?
R:  Um, [NOISE] actually it's funny you should say that, there was just a big, um, there was just a big newspaper article about a government job for the Canadian government that had to do with native fisheries and the application for a position said, basically, "If you're not native, don't apply". [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  And there -- and there was a --
L:  Is that right?
R:  -- and there was a big uproar in the newspaper and, you know, wi- with the opposition, um, parties about, you know, the posting of this -- this position and, you know, why it basically said, if you're white, don't bother and, uh, so yeah, we don't -- we don't have the black issue here, it's more a native issue.
L:  That's interesting, because talking about the black issue, I was reading something to do with, uh, Clarence Thomas --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- in which he voted against affirmative action, saying that because affirmative action makes the black man appear that he is less, uh, capable or less, uh, be- uh, less, well, less capable than the white person in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the same position if he was given that position because of affirmative action.
R:  That was quite a few years ago, wasn't it, like, ten --
L:  Yeah it did --
R:  -- fifteen years ago?
L:  -- but it came up again with this vote.
R:  Oh, it did, ay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's, wow.  Yeah, it's hard to say, I mean I've -- I've, uh, we -- like I say, we don't have a black issue here, really, I mean it's -- it's more, um, native and, uh, I taught on reserves for five years, I'm a te- I'm a school teacher and, you know, I saw people in positions that were there because of who they knew and not because of what they could do and, you know, it hurt kids and it hurt people in the community.
L:  I realize a situation affirmative action down here as far as blacks are concerned because I know sometimes in the cases where there are graduates or where they're going into a college or whatever, they want to give them, uh, the advantage, let's say of graduating --
R:  Right.
L:  -- by giving them a certain amount of points towards graduation --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I, you know, I -- I don't know where this stems from, does it stem from that the black person doesn't have the background that they need, or they come from an environment that really, uh, [MN] is -- is -- is g- is against them learning faster or learning, uh, in -- in the same vein as a white person, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if the school says they are I would imagine they should have the same opportunity.  I do remember one circumstance in which somebody told me when I was substitute teaching that some of the students in classes go home to an atmosphere that involved them sleeping, you know, maybe four on a bed, or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- five in a room --
R:  Right.  Are --
L:  -- and having --
R:  -- you a teacher?
L:  -- no air conditioning and having not the opportunity to be able to study.
R:  Right.  Are --
L:  So I --
R:  -- you a teacher?
L:  -- can understand that.
R:  Yeah.  Are you a teacher?
L:  No, I'm not.  I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- was with NBC and I, uh, was there for thirty years and then I decided to do some substitute teaching, uh --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- after I, you know, retired.
R:  Right.  Um, yeah well, I -- I would agree with that, I mean I -- living on a reserve for five years and seeing the kids' homes, like, I would go, you know, to visit them and I would take their report cards there and, um, I mean, they just didn't have the tools, um, most of them didn't have the tools that you would consider necessary for kids to succeed, you know, to a great degree.  Um, I mean, if I think of my house, I mean, I'm a teacher, my husband's a psychologist and --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- you know, our kids are in music lessons and gymnastics and we could just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- went to the library today and we went up to a co- you know, classical music concert and, you know, things like that, and so they're exposed to so many different things and they have so many opportunities and they have all the tools they need and, you know, compare that to someone who goes home and, you know, maybe somebody in the family's drinking and maybe someone else in the family's, you know --
L:  And the atmosphere --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- that they must have at home, especially with so many people living in the same room --
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  -- and, uh, not being to able to study, not being able to really have the opportunity to have the -- somebody, you know, uh, support them, their parents or whatever may be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm not saying that all homes are like that because a lot of homes, even under those circumstances --
R:  They do their best.
L:  -- the parents do the best they can and they try.  I know my daughter's a speech language pathologist in a school --
R:  Right.
L:  -- system in New York City --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, some of these students that come to school, uh, who come from very, very poor families, but the parents are so interested in what they're doing --
R:  Yeah, they want better for their child --
L:  And they --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- s- yeah, they come to this school and they -- they try to do things for the s- for the school and for themselves, it's amazing, you know, when you see this --
R:  Right.
L:  -- i- it -- it goes opposite from what I ever thought, I thought the parents just sort of leave them alone, but they are very supportive and some of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- them are very supportive of their students, but al- too many of them, I guess the majority, are not.
R:  Yeah, I think that's why you can't make broad generalizations, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I think it's a support thing, even attitudes towards education in the family.  Um, I -- I dated a guy for five years and he's -- his family came from Hong Kong and he said, "The expectation in my family is that we will go to university, you know, they didn't care what we took, but you will go, and that's all there is to it".
L:  That's the marvellous part about some families like this.
R:  Yeah, and -- and in my family, my mom and -- my mom and her parents were farming people and I'm one of the few people that have -- that went to university, you know, they're -- I can think of me and my uncle got a -- a -- a degree of, like, a [NOISE] um, doctorate of divinity or something to go into the ministry, but other than that there aren't any graduates, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, university graduates on my mom's side of the family.
L:  Well, the same thing --
R:  You know --
L:  -- with my father, my father never got mo- for- further -- farther than the eighth grade --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and yet he was able to bring himself up by bootstraps, eventually having his own business and supporting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- himself and sending his four children, including myself, all to college --
R:  Right, that's --
L:  But of course --
R:  -- wonderful.
L:  -- in my -- in our time, I think, in my time anyway, they didn't have affirmative action --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and this is, of course, something new within the last, I don't know, how many years?  I guess, what, ten, fifteen, twenty years?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Well, I -- I can see the benefits of it, giving somebody who might be down a little bit on their luck, a chance, um, but I can also see that it could breed resentment.  Um, when I taught on the reserves, we had teachers who had gone to a special native teacher education program and they only needed a grade eight education to enter the program, so right away they're a -- you know, they don't have the knowledge base, most of them, that, you know, someone who's graduated high school would have and then, um, you know, then they're more likely to get a job in those places and then they didn't have to pay any income tax, you know, because of their status and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, so, you know, there was always a tension between, you know, teachers that, you know, um, that shouldn't have been there, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, it sort of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- was because of, you know, the breaks that they got along the way, so --
L:  Well, that's the wonderful part about affirmative action, I guess, the people that are are -- have been able to take advantage of it and do advance by it, you know, and where they would not have done it before --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's great to see --
R:  And then --
L:  -- it happen.
R:  -- hopefully they'll --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well, then, hopefully they'll be a role model to more --
L:  Well --
R:  -- you know
L:  -- I think it was Sandra Day O'Connor, the Supreme Court Justice, said --
R:  Right.
L:  -- hopefully, there won't be any necessity in about twenty five years, I don't see how she comes to that figure, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in twenty five years there wouldn't be any necessity for affirmative action.
R:  Yeah, well, we just, um, the Globe and Mail is -- is our major national newspaper in Canada and they just ran a big article on the new Canada, basically saying, you know, kids of this generation don't look at race, you know, they don't look at the person whose family came from Trinidad, they don't look at the person whose family came from Jamaica, as being different, you know, that it's -- that those stereotypes are going, because they just, you know, it's a blending of the races [NOISE] and that there's, you know, ideas have changed and [NOISE] that the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- next generation is the one that's going to pull us out of this, you know, "You're a girl, so you can't be a fireman" and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, "You're, um, a boy so you can't be a nurse" and, you know, "You're disabled, so you can't do this", like, they're -- they have the -- more healthy ideas than our generation did --
L:  The whole --
R:  -- you know, about --
L:  -- broad concept of education is changing, obviously, very --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think to the good in the future, it takes a long time [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it goes against the grain of a lot of people and it goes against the grain of, uh, the people who -- who don't benefit by it and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, you know, you can't help but ec- but feel, uh, concerned for, let's say, somebody who is going to go to Harvard Law School and -- and m- may have a -- a four A average, but somebody who was given twenty points can -- can [MN] uh, have a greater average by certain percentage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- point and take his place --
R:  Yeah, for sure.
L:  -- and that's a resentful thing on the person that doesn't make it, but that's what has to hap- to be, I think, in the future.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, perhaps.  It's hard to know, it's -- it's --
L:  Where --
R:  -- a touchy subject.
L:  -- what -- what -- wha- are you from Canada?
R:  Yes.
L:  Really?  I sound -- uh, yeah, I can tell your voice by --
R:  I'm -- um, we -- I live close to Victoria --
L:  Well, don't --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- you have pre- prejudice as far as, um, as s- like in Quebec, as far as French --
R:  Um --
L:  -- speaking --
R:  -- mm --
L:  -- French?
R:  -- yeah, there's, um, there are a lot of French Canadian people who think that they should succeed from Canada, or secede from Canada and not be a part of -- of Canada. [MN]
L:  They don't have any affirmative action up there as far as --
R:  Um, I think that maybe it would come down to language, your language --
L:  Really?
R:  -- ability --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that you would get preference for jobs if you were totally bilingual, French and English, but I don't think, I -- I don't know, I don't have enough experience, my husband grew up in Montreal, um, so he might know that more ...
