L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Sabrina.
L:  Hi, my name is Lynette.  So I guess we're supposed to talk about public schools. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, the county --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that we live in has excellent public schools.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, we're in Tennessee and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- um, I mean, I have a -- a two year old so we're not in the -- the system yet, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, I think -- I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that m- maybe -- overall there maybe pockets of problems throughout the country --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I think that if the parents get involved more -- I think that's the whole issue, that parents just aren't involved with the school system.
R:  Okay.  I agree definitely about the parents.  I live in Los Angeles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, from preschool to sixth grade I went to a private school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, when I got in the seventh grade that's when I started going to public schools and there was a dramatic difference.
L:  Really? [LAUGH]
R:  I notice -- yeah, there was a big [NOISE] difference --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- just with not only the teachers -- just, I don't know, the whole --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- way the school was ran.  It was like, I guess since you weren't paying for school that they just didn't put as much time and attention to you.  So that was [COUGH] a dramatic difference there that --
L:  Were the classes smaller or larger?
R:  [NOISE] Um, I'd say they were about the same.
L:  'Cause I -- I did go to public s- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, I went to a private school from kindergarten through twelfth grade --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- in Louisiana.  And so I didn't really experience the public school starting -- you know, I know -- I had friends in public school and -- and just the way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they talked it was almost like the teachers didn't have control of --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's --
L:  -- of anything. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] -- pretty much how it was.  Like, when I was in private school we used to have a -- a Bible class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] -- and everything.  But in public school it wasn't like that at all, it was just kind of like --
L:  You can't even say Bible in public school. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Like it's -- it's against the law I guess to have religion in schools now.
L:  Mhm.  And that might be -- I don't know if we should say that on this line but --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- that might be another thing that's kind of wrong with it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think so, definitely.  Even if you're not, you know, into religion like that, it's just something that kind of keeps you grounded I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] Like it just -- I don't know, it keeps more order and like -- when I was in elementary school, like, people had morals and stuff.  When I got to public school it was just, like, the students were more disrespectful and it was just, like -- I don't know, I guess you could say, like, the teachers didn't have as much control.
L:  Right.
R:  I noticed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that definitely, because it was, like, stuff that I didn't used to get away with in private schools, ah, we could do it here in public school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and nobody seemed to care.
L:  And it's not just --
R:  So --
L:  -- you know, going into high school because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean we couldn't get away with anything --
R:  Really?
L:  -- in my private school, even in high school.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that is -- that is a good point 'cause I do think that makes a big difference but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean -- but I think too and I don't know, you know, what district you were in for high school, but I think, you know, fortunately the county that we are in now is --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- the richest county in Tennessee --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- so they dump a lot of money into the public school system.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But I -- I mean we haven't -- I haven't had first hand experience with it here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- this is just hearsay, but, you know, everybody wants to be in this school district -- the public school district in this county.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So we're assuming that it's a little better but I think you're still going to have that control issue where the teachers just don't have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- any control.  
R:  Right and yeah, they say it's like a money issue too.  Well, in my school I don't think we had like big issues with money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it was like when we did get money I never seen it going to anything, you know, that the students can really use.  Like I was a cheerleader --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't know if you heard of a rapper named Max and he used to go to my school.
L:  Oh.
R:  I guess he graduated from there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I went to Inglewood High School.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so when I was in the ninth grade he had gave the cheerleaders money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we took a trip to Las Vegas.  So you know what I'm saying?  He gave money to our school but it was for just the cheerleaders to go to Vegas.  It wasn't like it was for books or anything.
L:  Right.
R:  So you know what I'm saying?  When we did get money it was like -- I never really saw -- not to say that that was a negative thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, you know what I'm saying?  It was -- I was involved too so it was fun, but just the whole school didn't benefit from it.
L:  It wasn't new computers --
R:  So --
L:  -- or new books --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or --
R:  No books or anything like that.  It was just like -- and then we did have a -- a problem with, um, teachers I guess.  We had a shortage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because there was, like, a lot of substitutes all the time.  We're like -- there was a couple of really good teachers but then there's, like, only a few out of all the teachers in the school.
L:  Gosh.
R:  And it's like -- I don't know, it's just the -- the ratio for good teachers to not so good teachers was, like -- there's way more teachers that are not so good than the good teachers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so it was like -- you know, the teachers that actually cared and didn't just say, "Do this and then do what you want".  So I mean, I don't know.  
L:  I think --
R:  Especially since I'm out of school I see, like -- of course when you're in school, you know what I'm saying, you think that the cool teacher is the one who just lets you do whatever you want --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- to do with them.  Yeah, but now that I'm out it's like, you really appreciate the ones that made you work and --
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  -- you've actually learned something from. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Everything looks differently on the outside.
R:  Right.
L:  Now I've -- I know that, you know, you've got teachers that it's just a -- a job for them.
R:  Right.
L:  They don't care if the kids learn anything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They don't care if -- but you also have that in pub- -- in private school too.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So I mean, I think -- but I do think that the teachers i- if -- if there's so many kids that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the teachers just don't have control over --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so it makes it hard for everybody else to learn in that type of environment.
R:  Right, especially, yeah, when there's so many kids and there's only one teacher.  Everyone doesn't get that special attention --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because there's just too many.
L:  So I don't know -- I don't -- it's hard to say that it's a public school thing, but --
R:  True.
L:  I mean I think --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- at least in private school the fam- -- the parents are dumping so much money into it, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when you pay your tuition and so the teachers almost have to have control --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or the -- the parents want to know what's going on.
R:  Exactly 'cause they're paying for it.  They're paying for you to teach their child or help them so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they want to see results.
L:  And if they don't --
R:  So I think then they --
L:  -- then they -- you know, they're going to the school board.
R:  Right.
L:  So I guess in that sense the parents are more involved in the private schools because they're paying that check every month or every year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then in public school it's kind of like, well, it's just taxpayer money, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's no big deal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I do -- I think a lot of it is -- does fall back on the parents.
R:  True.
L:  I mean, you know, because it's -- it's the people that we elect for the school board and the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the, you know -- so it is, it's our responsibility I think.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and I probably only think this way because I now have a child. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, you're a parent so you would see it.  I'm not a parent yet so, um -- but, yeah, I definitely think they have a lot to do with it because it -- it all starts at home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean if, you know, before the child even gets to school so --
L:  If you didn't respect your mom and dad at home --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you're not going to respect the teachers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then the teachers can't do their job.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So then they don't want to teach in the public school system.
R:  Right.  I think that definitely has to do with a lot of the behavioral problems.  That definitely comes from home because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know with me, like the only person that I was scared of was my mom.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?  If I did something wrong, you know, I was scared it was going to get back to her, you know --
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  -- what I'm saying?  Because I was taught at home, you know, right from wrong.  I wasn't, you know, scared of the teachers.  I wasn't disrespectful either, but I was always, like, what is my mom going to think?  So it --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- it starts at home. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause you knew that she'd find out and you'd be in trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And then that would make you straighten up, so --
L:  That's how I was with my dad.  I mean --
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  -- I knew [LAUGH] you know, if I brought home a bad report card he was going to know and I was going to get in trouble.
R:  Right.
L:  And I think kids aren't af- -- some kids today aren't afraid of anything.
R:  Right, they don't care. [LAUGH]
L:  So [LAUGH] you know, I mean, not that you should have this fear of teachers, but you should.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you should respect them and -- I mean, I just think it's -- I just think the whole environment that teachers have to work in has just changed [NOISE] so much over the past [NOISE] several years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um --
R:  And then a lot of 'em, like, in -- well, this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is from like the news and everything because I was in the Inglewood school district, but the Los Angeles school district --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was hearing how, you know, the teachers were underpaid and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- especially if that's happening they're really not, you know, going to care too much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about, you know, trying to put extra effort into it.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If they're not being paid --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, then their attitude is, you know, "I'm -- I'm -- this is just a job.  Come to work and get money" and --
L:  It's sad.  I mean, teachers are not paid anything. [NOISE]
R:  R- really?
L:  I mean [NOISE] I don't think they're paid enough.  I mean, they -- you know, for what they do --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I know they have great hours and they're off in the summer and this that and the other, but, you know, they don't -- they don't get the respect, that's for sure.  
R:  Right.
L:  And it's like, "Oh, you're just a teacher".
R:  They have a lot to deal with, especially with high school students. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
