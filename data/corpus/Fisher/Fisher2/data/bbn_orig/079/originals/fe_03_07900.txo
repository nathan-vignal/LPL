R:  Becky. [NOISE]
L:  I'm Stan.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, Becky.  Um, I'm not sure exactly, uh, if I'm the right one.  My wife and I both signed up for this thing so --
R:  Okay.
L:  When they called me I just -- I went ahead and took the call.  I hope that's okay.
R:  Yeah, that's fine.  My -- I have never done this before either so --
L:  Okay, well.
R:  My husband signed up for it too, so --
L:  All right, well, I guess we'll make the best of it. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh, so what would you do if they offered you a million dollars to never speak to your best friend again?
R:  Oh, I don't know.  It [LIPSMACK] depends.  I don't -- uh, right now I just don't have too much of a best friend, so unless it be my husband or my sister in law I don't think I'd take it.  So --
L:  Well, of course I guess that's true with my wife or my -- I've got a couple of brothers in law that are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I'd hate to lose.
R:  Yeah. [inaudible] --
L:  Of course my former best friends who I don't see very often any more because he moved to another town.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I -- you know, I'd lose him for a million bucks --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll tell you now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Be easier 'cause you haven't seen him in so long.
L:  Uh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  That -- and he would do the same thing to me so I'm not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- worried about him.
R:  I'm sure.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it would just be hard because my husband he's like my best friend so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't want to lose him.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know though.  That's a lot of money.  But, nah.
L:  Well, yeah, you know when your -- your spouse is also your best friend --
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot of people don't have that.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  It's too bad when they're [NOISE] not their best friend though.
L:  Yeah.  I, uh, I have known those who, you know, well -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Most of 'em wound up divorced and whatever because of it.
R:  Yeah.  That's the scary part of being [NOISE] married.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wondering if you're gonna wind up divorced or not.
L:  Well, if both of you are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- commited to it I guess it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what counts but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lot of times people don't count it that way.  They --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're in it for what they can get.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  It's not good enough they leave and try to find something better.
L:  Yeah.  What is it I heard one time where they're -- they're doing marriage vows now saying, "As long as you both shall love".
R:  Uh-huh.  Instead of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- live.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hadn't heard that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  Takes all kinds, I guess.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Getting back to the subject though.  I sure could use a million bucks right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Tell me about it.
L:  I wonder -- wonder who I could dump for a million dollars?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, anyway, there's a lot of bills you could pay with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Buy a house.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Nice house for that kind of --
R:  Yeah, you can always dream.
L:  I wonder, uh, I wonder if I could tell him, "So, okay, I'll never speak to my best friend again.  Give --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- me a million dollars and my best friend is" --
R:  Yeah, that's perfect.
L:  -- and then make up a name [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Just pick somebody that you don't really care for anyway.
L:  Yeah, right, yeah.
R:  Can -- you could stand --
L:  The mother in law as w-. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my.  
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  They could -- they could say, "No, that's not your best friend.  Who's ever had a mother in law that was their best friend?" [LAUGH]
L:  Well, there are those.
R:  I get along with mine.  She's --
L:  Uh, I kinda get along with mine but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she lives in another city though so that helps. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, [LAUGH] yeah, mine lives in another state. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] 
L:  Well, actually she's in another state too but it's not terribly far from here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's a hundred miles, a hundred and twenty miles.
R:  Oh, that's not bad.
L:  So, we go down there every so often, you know, they come up here for Christmas and things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It works out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm not sure if I'm getting used to this echo on this phone or not though.  I keep hearing myself coming back at me.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, I guess it's okay.
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my.
L:  What part of the country do you live in?
R:  Um, down in south.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Tennessee.
R:  Virginia.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yep.
L:  I've only been there once or twice but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's gorgeous country down there.
R:  Yeah, I love it. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I used to live in Tennessee a long time ago.
L:  All right?
R:  Yep. [NOISE] 
L:  What part?
R:  Um, up in the -- on the border with like Kentucky and Tennessee.  My father was in the Army.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, so 
L:  That's one area I've never been to very --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- much.  So --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I've been, uh, middle and east Tennessee, Nashville --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and Chattanooga and Knoxville[?].
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, where was it?  Uh, I went through Virginia one time.  I'm trying to remember the name of the city.  It wasn't Charlottesville but it was a name like that.  It was --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Anyway --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  Gorgeous little town.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gorgeous little town.  Made me wanna live there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it -- I always loved it too and then [NOISE] we finally moved down here.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's nice.  A little hot but [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah, well.
R:  Yeah.  I've never been down --
L:  You get used to it.
R:  Yeah, we've always lived up north, so 
L:  So, you're not originally from the south, huh?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You are or you're not?
R:  [NOISE] What's that?
L:  Did you say you were or were not originally from the --
R:  No, we lived in Pennsylvania.  We've always lived up north. [NOISE] So   New York and Pennsylvania, so --
L:  Ah.
R:  This is different for us but it's nice.
L:  You know, as long as you've got a good job and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever that's   
R:  Yeah.
L:  Makes it worthwhile.
R:  Yeah.  So 
L:  [COUGH] [NOISE] There's a racket going on here.  I don't know what's going on.  I apologize for that. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I don't hear it.  It must be just on your end.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Oh.
L:  Sometimes, uh, y- you know, you said you -- this is the first time you've answered one of these things and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And mine too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, it's, you know --
R:  It's -- yeah, it's different.
L:  A bit awkward and I apologize if I'm not quite --
R:  Oh, me too.  I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, no you're -- you're doing fine.  What, uh, what sort of work do you do?  You, uh --
R:  I don't work.  I stay home with my two children.
L:  Oh, that's a good thing to do.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  Um, a survey thingy. [LAUGH] My wife asking me who I'm talking to.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh, it's one of those phone whatever it's called [several inaudible words].  I signed up for it so they -- they called a while ago.  And so [MN] I'm not ignoring you miss I just -- or ma'am -- I'm just, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- talking to my missus over here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Mm.  Yeah.  So, what do you do?

R:  Do you sing or 
L:  Well, I sing and I play and I write and I do all sorts of --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- things.
R:  Wow.
L:  None of which are all that great but [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  At least I enjoy doing it.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] Gotta do what you enjoy or else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you won't be very happy with it.  
L:  Now if I could just make a living at it it'd be wonderful. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, some day when the kids are older I wanna go back -- go to school and try to be a nurse [NOISE] or something.
L:  Oh.
R:  But 
L:  That would be nice [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, gotta wait until they grow up a little bit.
L:  How old are they?
R:  Um, two and seven weeks.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Itty bitty one, huh?
R:  Yeah, just a little one.
L:  Well, my son's fifteen and my daughter's seven so I'm --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  They're getting on up there and my little girl's losing her front teeth. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  Got one just hanging on right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my, yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I wish, uh   There's -- there she comes now with her loose front tooth.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN] It'll probably come out today most likely.
R:  Yeah, just gotta work out a little bit.
L:  Yeah.  So, who would you like to dump for a million dollars? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't even know. [NOISE] 
L:  I'm trying to get us to, you know, stay on the point --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as much as we can and it's -- it's kinda hard to think of what to say though.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  But --
R:  I guess I could pick a friend that we moved away from.  That'd always be easier.
L:  Yeah, that would help.
R:  Yeah.  You don't see 'em anyway hardly.  So --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Then you could buy what you wanted.
L:  Right.  You could always say, "Yeah, my best friend is -- and then pick somebody famous", you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Bill Clinton, or [LAUGH] everybody --
R:  Oh, yeah, I dumped him.
L:  Yeah, I, you know, I pick Bill Clinton.  I'll never speak to him again. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or Hilary especially. 
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  No, I'd [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my.
L:  [SIGH] That wasn't nice, was it?
R:  N- [LAUGH] [SIGH] 
L:  But, you know, you -- a million bucks is a million bucks, right?
R:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, you could buy your dream house, or build your dream house and --
L:  Yeah.

R:  Oh, yeah.

R:  Yeah, that's what we like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Love that.  That's our dream house.
L:  Yeah, really?
R:  Yep.  Maybe some day.
L:  I hope so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For your sake and mine.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I hope we get one anyway.
R:  Mhm.  Oh.

R:  Yeah?  Tell her she has to take care of you then.
L:  Yeah.  If you get rich and famous you have to take care of me for the rest of my life. [NOISE] She said she would.
R:  Oh, okay, that's --
L:  But she's only seven.  She doesn't know any better. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] You'll have to make her sign some-
