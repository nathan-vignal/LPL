L:  [SIGH]  Hello?
R:  Hi!  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, my name is Richard.  I'm in, ah, S- Seattle.  [SIGH]
R:  In Seattle.  I'm Jackie.  I'm in Arizona.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, cool.  [SIGH]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so you've got the nice beautiful weather and we get the ... --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- nice hot weather.  [LAUGH]
L:  Is it like ... a hundred and something?
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  That's pretty cool right now.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And when I say "cool" I mean --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's probably about a hundred, --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- a hundred and five.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Really?
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [COUGH]  That would kill me.  [NOISE]
R:  A- ah, [MN] you get used to it pretty fast it's --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- it's ac- -- oh, it's a hundred and seven today, I take it back.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, gosh!  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, [SIGH] um, --
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  -- but, yeah, it's really dry.
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  And so it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's not like ... when it's h- humid --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in other places where it's really hot and humid.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, ...
L:  I just couldn't take it though.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [COUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  I couldn't --
L:  [SIGH]  I don't have m- much for the public school system.  [SIGH]
R:  Really?
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Do you have children?
L:  [SIGH]  [MN]  Um, [SIGH] raised [COUGH] but, um, [SIGH] I think as long as [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- ah, an entry level bus driver with a co, -- ah, high school education makes more [SIGH] than ... a teacher with ten years' --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- experience and a Masters Degree [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there is something wrong -- at least in i- i- in the S- Seattle area.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think there's something [SIGH] w- wrong and I think the good teachers are going to leave.
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  Because when, um, teachers have to work second jobs and have to, you know, leave [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- their [COUGH] job every day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as teaching ... students to go be a waitress, or w- whatever, [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as a second job, I think there's something wrong with [SIGH] -- I think we don't respect [SIGH] the people we put in charge of our c- children for several hours a day.  [SIGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  That's just my thinking.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, [LIPSMACK] I th- -- but I also believe that people who go into teaching go ... into it for more than just the money.  Ob- obviously they have to or they wouldn't--
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  -- you know, they'd be going for a more lucrative position.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  I agree they are underpaid, [SIGH] um, [MN] and, ah, I think usually you'll get people who, ah, have other sources of income, you know, like, a spouse [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- who can b- bring up the rear, [SIGH] so to speak.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I think if you have [MN] other sources, like you're married o- or you know --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you have a roommate or something who helps.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Because [COUGH], excuse me, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] I -- I mean I'm fifty four but when I was eighteen in the college, [SIGH] um, I wasn't even c- considering education because I knew it didn't pay well.  It wasn't respected.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and [SIGH] I -- I taught one year in a private school and I e- enjoyed it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I couldn't [SIGH] -- I couldn't, um, [SIGH] live with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just that salary.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  And, you know, they're [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're taking away [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so many needed programs [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like h- here in the Seattle area [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] they're reducing [SIGH] t- -- just w- what I've read in the paper --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're reducing like the school nurses.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's just one area that I'm aware of.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Not to mention special ed and music and art and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  -- all those things.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  And I don't know about you know about ... Arizona [NOISE] but we're --
L:  Nothing.  [SIGH]
R:  -- we're considered to be l- like the -- one of the worst states [NOISE] to --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- live in --
L:  [SIGH]  Really?
R:  -- if you're a child.  [SIGH]  Um, not so much just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for education but education, [NOISE] health care, [SIGH] a- ah --
L:  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  -- a lot of things.  [NOISE]  Um, but --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [NOISE] I think a lot of it --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- depends on the area ... you live in --
L:  [SIGH]  Okay, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the school district you're in.
L:  [NOISE]  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  Ah, my kids, [NOISE] well, my -- my daughter just started kindergarten --
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  -- last year [NOISE] [SIGH] and t- the school district we're in, ah, I really resisted p- putting her in a public school, --
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  -- but we didn't get into the ... private school we wanted.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  I'm so glad she's there.
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  She has -- is getting a wonderful -- wonderful --
L:  [NOISE]  Good.  [SIGH]
R:  -- education and it's a really good school --
L:  Good.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and the teachers are r- really involved.  [SIGH]
L:  Good.  [SIGH]
R:  Parents are very involved and I think -- I think the parent involvement makes a big difference there.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.
R:  But I -- I know there are other parts of the -- the city even that I wouldn't want ... to send my child --
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  -- to their school.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And I think it is up to the parents to, [SIGH] ah, provide, [SIGH] ah, music lessons.  Extra curricular --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah -- ah, outlets.  [SIGH]  And I think you're right.  I think, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  like, a strong [SIGH] parents' system in the school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] is very --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- important.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  And, yeah, I've [SIGH] -- I've known people who've had wonderful educations in the public school system, --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know.  [SIGH]  And I was just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as I was leaving today [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't [SIGH] -- I don't like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the program, it's too glitzy, but I was noticing that [SIGH] Oprah was, ah, honoring three --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] outstanding teachers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  And I think, yes, I think [NOISE] some people are extremely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dedicated.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And I think some people are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] a- are in teaching for all the right reasons.
R:  Yes.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  A- another thing we have in Arizona is, um, [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- charter schools --
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  -- are quite abundant.  It's a new [NOISE] -- I guess it's an old +school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- school program --
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  -- but it has [SIGH] r- regone a new, ah, [LIPSMACK] interest.  What it is it's a -- it's like a private school but it is state funded.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  Um, they draw up a charter and it says --
L:  Oh, yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, "We're going to be a school that focuses on, [SIGH] you know, college prep" or "We're going to focus on --"
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  "-- music" [SIGH] and, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, as long as they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- m- meet the basic requirements [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they get ... s- state funding for every --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- s- student they h- have.
L:  Really?  [NOISE]
R:  And it's drawing --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- a lot of, um --
L:  [COUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  -- students away from the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- public schools [SIGH] even though these are also public schools.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, you know, they're difference in the public schools is that they have to let you in if --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you live in the area --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- but charter schools --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- may say, "Well we only have --"
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  "-- enough for fifty students" --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE]  That is so interesting.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, and they -- they've been --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- very popular but --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- also because of that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was very easy to get started --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and there are -- there were a lot of 'em where people just --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] jumped in and saw it as a business [SIGH] and then --
L:  [SIGH]  Wow!
R:  -- and then f- failed miserably.  I mean there --
L:  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  -- people their kids would show up at school --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, ah, the school would b- [LAUGH] be closed [SIGH] you know.
L:  Really?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it -- it got abused so people a- are a lot more leery --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- now of going to a charter school.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But --
L:  Wow!  [SIGH]
R:  -- but if you're -- you know, like, if I lived in an area --
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  -- where the public school was not a good one I would definitely be ... putting my kids in a charter school.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I wonder if they have that here 'cause, you know, not being involved in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] in that I would have no idea.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow!  [SIGH]  But I think [SIGH] -- I don't know I've just -- [SIGH] like I say I've [SIGH] [MN] -- I've known a lot of people who've had excellent experiences, [SIGH] um, in public schools.  It's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're very few [SIGH] people I know [MN] who have been in e- education [SIGH] have had to get out of it.  [SIGH]  And, um, [SIGH] -- and we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, like, the same with social workers you know.  [SIGH]  I've had ... ah, people who love --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being in social work but they just c- can't [SIGH] live on what they're paid.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah, [NOISE] that's ...
L:  [SIGH]  And I think [SIGH] we do [SIGH] -- we do p- ... put money into what we value.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, like in Seattle we have [SIGH] a stadium just for football --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] and one j- just for baseball.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  And then [SIGH] w- ah, people will haggle about [SIGH] the homeless not having those porta potties, you know, [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's like [SIGH] we -- we can always [SIGH] ... a- approve of money and [SIGH] pay for things we value.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  And I just don't think [SIGH] -- 'cause I've had f- f- friends who have [SIGH] dropped out of school sadly and I think if they'd had [MN] [SIGH] if the schools had had t- the [SIGH] special classes and special teachers, [SIGH] I mean, the -- the outcome might have been the same but maybe not.  [SIGH]
R:  I -- I'm finding a lot of the teachers in my daughter's school --
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  -- have Masters ... degrees
L:  Good.
R:  -- in education and that's -- they said that's the only way they can get any money.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  If you c- -- if you come --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and teach with a Bachelor's degree you're making twenty, twenty two thousand.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Get a Masters you can make thirty, thirty six --
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- which is s- still pretty --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- m- measly --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but [SIGH] at least liveable.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And -- and much better than [SIGH] -- than the t- twenty.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  But ...
L:  [SIGH]  And -- well, I had a friend and because [SIGH] his wife was also in education [SIGH] they were actually doing pretty well but like I said it took b- both of them.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  And he -- he said if -- [SIGH] if he didn't have his wife --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and she said the same thing [NOISE] they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- don't know if they could have stayed in teaching.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And it's sad 'cause [SIGH] good people leave.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I think that's one area where you need people who [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are excited -- like kids, are excited about teaching --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's just [SIGH] t- too bad.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I'm just kind of p- prejudiced --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] anyway [SIGH] and I don't have that much t- to base it on anymore it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the f- few people I've known [SIGH] who have gotten out of teaching.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just l -- like the few people I've known who've gotten out of social work, you know, [SIGH] it was all about money.  [SIGH]  And, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] -- but, wow, that c- charter school [SIGH] sounds interesting I -- I would think S- Seattle would [SIGH] -- I'm just curious [SIGH] --
R:  Would go for that.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, or has, maybe.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And [SIGH] but you ha- -- do you have more than one child in school?  [SIGH]
R:  A- a- ah, I -- I have a preschooler so --
L:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
R:  -- I guess that doesn't count.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Because I know when I was in [SIGH] private school it was excellent, you know.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] ah, I just -- I just swear by [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- private schools.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But not everybody can afford them either.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Well, that's kind of what these are.  The c- charter schools are --
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  -- they're very much like private sc- -- they are private.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  They're privately owned and operated --
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] but they do have to follow certain --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rules --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Okay.
R:  -- mandated by the state, you know --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and like you need to have so many hours of math [NOISE] and so many hours of, [SIGH] y- you know, English --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and you do have to take all the s- state required tests.
