L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hi, I'm Alicia.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, I'm George.  [SIGH]
R:  Hey, George.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm g- good.  [NOISE]  Ah, where are you calling from?  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, New York. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, me too!
L:  Is that right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Are you in New York City?  [SIGH]
L:  Midtown, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Me, too!
L:  Oh, m- [LAUGH] my goodness.  That's amazing.  [LAUGH]
R:  W- where are you?
L:  [SIGH]  Murray Hill.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, how funny, I'm Forty Third and Tenth.
L:  [SIGH]  That's amazing.
R:  That's so funny.  I've been talking to A- Alabama.
L:  Oh, well, that's right.  I had California, Texas, ah, [LAUGH] --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] Seattle.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  That's so funny --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is this your last one?
L:  A- ah, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, me too.  So, [MN] but, ah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I keep calling and can't get through.  So, ...
L:  I know.  They had some trouble for a few days.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, but [SIGH] I -- I never know whether we're supposed to stick to the topic or whether --
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, I think they --
R:  -- they just want to hear us talk.
L:  -- [SIGH] I think they -- they do review them, I think.  [SIGH]
R:  O- oh, okay.
L:  But t- that's fine.  [SIGH]  Ah, --
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]  Well, what --
L:  -- [SIGH]  well --
R:  -- do you think of the state of public schools?
L:  Public schools?  Hm, [MN] [SIGH] well, I [SIGH] don't know --
R:  I k- [LAUGH] know.  I'm like, ah --
L:  -- I mean the first [SIGH] -- the first thing that comes to mind with public schools for me is a ... block away from here on Thirty Third and Park [SIGH] there is a public school [SIGH] Norman Thomas High school.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And [SIGH] I g- go by there and I actually stopped going by there because it is s- so horrible.
R:  Really?  [SIGH]
L:  It is so h- horrible [NOISE] when you -- when they arrive or when they leave or when they're on -- you know, it's just -- and I think, "My --"
R:  Just trying to get through or just ...
L:  Well, no, it's just -- it is so ho- -- the -- t- they --
R:  The kids.
L:  -- they bus them all in I think from the Bronx --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- and --and from -- and I am not [LAUGH] believe me [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, no, I'm with you.
L:  -- I am -- I am not a -- but I just think the future of this country is here and it is unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  It is so sad.  And now it is so bad.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  These kids -- I don't remember being like this when I was in high school.
R:  I know.  I know, [SIGH] and --
L:  These --
R:  -- [SIGH] and I remember being in high school and hearing ... adults [SIGH] say that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] and I'm just like, "Oh!" but I -- I'm right there with you.
L:  But I --
R:  Just like --
L:  -- do you know, they have ten policemen [SIGH] --
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  -- on duty [SIGH] to make them get out of the neighborhood, to go back to where they came from [SIGH] after school because they're so bad.  [SIGH]
R:  W- wow!
L:  It is unbelievable, the marijuana that gets smoked, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the drugs.  The [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- the language.  The noise.  I mean it is just horrible.
R:  Yeah, you look w- what is -- what is causing this.  I mean I -- obviously parenting but [SIGH] you know, it's just I -- I think it's all so -- so difficult.  A friend of mine did that Teach for America [MN] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- where you're put in, ah, you know, in l- less [SIGH] [NOISE] wealthy schools and, you know, in -- in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in impoverished neighborhoods --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] and, ah, he -- he quit because he was like, [NOISE] "I -- I could not teach", [NOISE] you know, he was just like, "They -- they [NOISE] w- weren't gonna listen to me" and --
L:  I have the same ... type of friend up in Yonkers who taught science for twenty two years [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and he ... left the school system, left --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- his retirement because he --
R:  W- wow!
L:  -- actually feared for his life.
R:  W- wow!  [SIGH]
L:  Feared for his life!
R:  I believe it though.  I believe it.
L:  And he was making sixty thousand dollars [SIGH] a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- year when he left [NOISE], after twenty two years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and he took a job at Bloomingdales.  [SIGH]
R:  W- [SIGH] wow!
L:  [SIGH]  So, there's just something wrong.  I don't know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's something wrong with the whole culture.  There's something wrong with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the times.  There's something wro- -- I don't know what the root of it is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's no parenting --
R:  So violent.
L:  -- [SIGH] there's no [SIGH] -- I mean you know, [LAUGH] -- you know, you talk about school, what can a teacher do if they -- if they show up in this kind of shape?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And will not listen to you ... you know, because they don't listen to their parents and --
L:  You know, you hear about these murders -- th- the -- ha- these shootings that happen in these schools around the country and, you know, f- f- fairly r- regular straight neighborhoods, not inner city type of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- situations.  [SIGH]  And you wonder why it doesn't happen more often here because it is just unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I mean all these kids were going through -- they were going through metal detectors before this was happening around the country.
R:  Oh, my, it's so amazing!
L:  Because they brought knives, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with them to school.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  It's s- so amazing.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know, there -- there are no more [SIGH] after school fights it's [SIGH] you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you -- not that that was ... great in the fifties but, --
L:  R- [LAUGH] right.
R:  -- you know, at least a kid wasn't gonna die m- most --
L:  Yeah, --
R:  -- likely.
L:  -- exactly.
R:  Well, I could --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- I'm sorry.
L:  -- at the time of the crunch that this city has with its budget --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- t- to have to pay [SIGH] what they pay [SIGH] --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- teachers to teach [SIGH] and then have to pay policemen --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be on duty [SIGH] --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- for two hours after school to clear the neighborhood.  [SIGH]
R:  Yep.  [SIGH]  For kids who don't want to go there anyway.
L:  Exactly.  [SIGH]
R:  But it's -- I don't know what the solution i- i- is.  I don't know.  [SIGH]  I -- I don't think it starts with getting better teachers, although I think that there is something to be said for [SIGH] ... teachers.  I mean, I -- I g- grew up in Kansas and God knows I had some teachers who d- did not give a shit --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- but y- [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  Hm.
R:  I don't know.  It's, y- yeah but [SIGH] it is scary.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But I'm seeing it in Kansas too --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- it's not just New York [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- when I go home to visit and --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I see the high school students.
L:  Well, I think it's the whole culture.
R:  Y- yeah, absolutely.
L:  Um, and I don't know if it's e- exposure to the kind of TV and movies that are made now [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that are so violent and so horrible and ... y- you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's just the kind of don't care attitude or [SIGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I don't know.  I don't know if it's -- if it's TV or [SIGH] -- because I think --
L:  It's no one thing.
R:  -- it's no one thing, exactly.  I -- I mean other than -- I do think t- that parenting is a huge factor with it.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that there are -- are just so many parents who gave birth too young or just [SIGH] didn't have any help --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there's no money, [NOISE] and the economy's crappy and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, it's just [SIGH] -- yeah.  [MN]
L:  Hm.  [NOISE]
R:  But I -- I don't know other than [SIGH] every person trying to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- r- raise their child [SIGH] to care --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but then, you know, s- so you raise your child to care but then you put them in a -- in a school system like that where everyone around them doesn't.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, ... you know, --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- which is the greater influence?  [SIGH]
L:  Hm.  Hm.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Hm.
R:  [SIGH]  Do you have kids?
L:  Ah, no.
R:  Yeah, me neither.
L:  No.  [SIGH]
R:  So, ...
L:  [SIGH]  I have, ah, -- I'm the oldest of nine.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  I have enough nieces and nephews to keep me going for a while.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that would do it.  W- wow, nine kids.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  [SIGH]
R:  That's crazy.  I'm an only child so I can't imagine.
L:  Oh, is that right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- y- yeah.  [SIGH]  That's crazy.
L:  Hm.
R:  [MN]  But -- so, ah --
L:  Well, it's definitely a problem --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] the school thing n- now, um, and it's a problem financially.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a problem ... m- morally.  It's a problem.  It's a problem at all levels.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [MN]  But I -- I -- I wish I had a solution to offer.  It's so difficult because I see those Teach America and [SIGH] boy we need great -- good teachers and I'm just like, " [SIGH] Wow!"  I mean 'cause starting rates for teachers is s- s- s- so low.
L:  [MN]  I know.
R:  Why on earth would anyone --
L:  Exactly.  [SIGH]
R:  -- do it?  [SIGH]
L:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  You know.
L:  -- take your life in your own hands practically.  [SIGH]
R:  Absolutely.
L:  A- ah, the working conditions [LAUGH] are not what, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know they used to be taking care of kids.
R:  No.
L:  It's just [SIGH] --
R:  Maybe preschool y- [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, I know.  [SIGH]
R:  Preschool, grade school.
L:  I mean I -- [SIGH] I do work over in Africa and India and you look at education and schooling, you know, it's j- just s- starting to be made available to some of those and to girls especially, like [NOISE] in Africa --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [SIGH] they would -- the -- they were never allowed to go to school.  They had to take -- stay home and take care of the household.  [SIGH]
R:  Of course.
L:  They were slave labor and, ah, um, [LIPSMACK] -- and these kids are like sponges they soak it up so much.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I mean it's just unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's extraordinary.  [SIGH]  It's such a difference from here where the attitude in the -- in the [SIGH] --
R:  Well, we've always had the right to -- you know, we've never -- [SIGH] it's never been seen as a privilege.  It's s- some -- it's drudgery.
L:  Yeah, and it's just taken for granted.
R:  Yeah, ... absolutely.
L:  I do think a lot of it s- starts in the home, though.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Th- the kids just aren't getting the right [LIPSMACK] I don't know value --
R:  Nurturing.
L:  -- system or sense of f- future or s- -- a vision for a future that one could actually excel to or [SIGH] ...
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Oh, also w- what -- what the +pop -- the pop icons [SIGH] that are so hot right now [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- did anyone go to college?
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's -- anyone can be famous so why stay in school?
L:  R- [LAUGH] right and play sports and everything else.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  There's so much emphasis put on that.  It's out of balance.
R:  Y- yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I mean talent is one thing and it -- it should be rewarded but now --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- it's just like, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now it's just a free for all.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, with all the reality TV [SIGH] --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- a- a- anyone can be famous.
L:  R- [LAUGH] right, exactly.
R:  Andy Warhol was right!
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  So, --
L:  But they want more than fifteen minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But that's all you get.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's so f- funny w- watching ... oh, it's just -- when is it going to end.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  But, I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  But it does seem -- I mean a- anyone can be famous --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, [SIGH] certainly you know, if you want to be a rap star it -- it -- theoretically it takes talent and skill [SIGH] but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, you don't have to go to school for it.  So, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- why go to school?
L:  I -- I was recently over in France and [SIGH] w- with three different families --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and all their kids g- go to school, and the same age as the kids who come to this Norman Thomas High School.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  They all speak three languages.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  W- wow.
L:  Two or three languages.  [SIGH]  They --
R:  What -- what's, ah, --
L:  They are --
R:  -- what's the ec -- ah, economic difference?  [SIGH]
L:  They're all --
R:  I mean as far --
L:  -- they're all l- living in the s- suburbs of Paris
