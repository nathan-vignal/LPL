L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm -- I'm Laurie.
L:  I'm -- I'm Overn.
R:  Hi Overn, um, okay, I am not certain if I would take it, ah -- what do you think?
L:  Um, me, I'm not sure either -- I've -- ah, my best -- I've been best friends with mine for over twenty years, so, [LAUGH] you know, it's kinda hard to trade twenty years for a million dollars.  I don't know.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I'll --
L:  I mean, not that I couldn't use the money.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I w- -- I'd -- if, you know, if speak means just speak, you know, physically speak on the phone, or, if it actually means communicate in any manner --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, that would be something that I'd want to verify, but, I'm guessing it means communicate in any manner.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, boy, I think that I would have to say that [LIPSMACK] I probably would not take it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if I had to make a decision.
L:  Yeah, that's a tough decision -- I don't know, I think it would, ah, yeah -- [MN] yeah, I probably -- I probably wouldn't either, I mean, like I said, she's been my best friend for over twenty years -- it's -- [SIGH] I -- I -- I just find it hard to imagine not having her -- being able to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- talk to her, you know?  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, does she live in the same place --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as you, or ...?
L:  Ah, no, no --
R:  In the same town?
L:  -- she doesn't live -- ah, [MN] you know, I -- I -- she lives -- I live in Southern California, and she lives in Northern California [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but, yeah, I've known her since high school, so ... [SIGH]
R:  I guess the other part of it would be, um, though -- like, my best friends don't live where I live either -- I live in Oregon, and they -- one lives in Minnesota, and one lives in Omaha, so, [SIGH] I guess, though that maybe you -- you could benefit their life as well, like, in my case I could probably help either one of my best friends if I had a million dollars, and, maybe their life would be that much better, even though I wasn't actually in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um ...
L:  True, that's ...
R:  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things to think about -- I guess that I'd never really given that much thought --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- before.
L:  Yeah, I wonder -- I -- I would -- [MN] I would want to know if I could communicate with them first, you know, before -- or, if I just had to cut ties with them without any explanation, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  Yes, and I think that would be a good question.  I guess -- you're -- you're right, it would probably depend on, um, if we got an opportunity to ask a coupla questions first of all, and one being exactly what you said -- is it immediate or do we have time to communicate what's going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that would probably make some difference. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um ...
L:  Definitely.  [SIGH] 
R:  It is a hard topic -- it's a hard -- a hard decision to make.
L:  Yeah, how long have you been friends with your best friends?  
R:  Um, for one about, [SIGH] oh, probably, I think going on like, seventeen -- twenty years maybe.
L:  Yeah, it's a long time to -- to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] just not be friends with somebody.
R:  Yeah, I haven't actually been, you know, seen -- I guess, my longest friend, I haven't actually physically seen her, probably in the last eight years, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're on the phone continually.
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't see --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- my friend all the time, but, we talk online, or [SIGH] -- or, on the phone, or -- and we see each other, you know, three or four times a year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she's got [MN] kids, and, I do too, and you know, the kids are close to the same age, so ...
R:  Yeah, well, that would be another consideration -- does that mean then, that your children could no longer maintain the friend- -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, there would be a lot of, um, things that maybe would play a part in it -- like, that -- [inaudible] find out --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- exactly what the terms -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were.
L:  [MN] I think it would be, you know -- it's hard to explain to my, ah, son you know, you can't, ah, ever speak to this person ever again because of money, you know?  [MN]
R:  Right, and you know what that would be -- how old is your son?
L:  He's eight.
R:  Yeah, I have one that's eleven -- that would be, um, kind of a difficult thing, and you know what?  I- in the world today, a million dollars is not really that much, I mean, granted I agree with you -- I could definitely use it right now [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, in the realm of -- of life, I guess, a million is not -- I -- it might be a bigger issue if it were, you know, twenty million, or fifty million.
L:  Yeah, which is, you know, what everyone's getting in the lottery these days.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that -- that's what I mean, a million dollars doesn't -- I mean, again [LAUGH], I would love it, but, it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- doesn't, ah -- it doesn't seem to be that much anymore.
L:  No.
R:  Years ago it would have been quite a bit, but, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I think -- I think you're right -- I think it would kinda depend on -- I mean, I know they said when we first started this that it, you know, the only stipulation was that you couldn't talk to your best friend any longer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, I think we would have to -- if we had an opportunity -- ask those few questions on how it -- you know, the kids, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- does it mean just speak verbally?  Or, does it mean not have any contact with them, or ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so, it is -- it's a real- -- it's a good question, though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's a -- a good, um, question -- I know that I did one the other day, I'm trying to think -- I can't remember what the topic was now, but, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, it was on bioterrorism.
L:  Oh, mm, [LIPSMACK] I --
R:  And ...
L:  I've only done --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- one about my pets.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you did it about your pets?
L:  No, just one about my pets, yeah.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  That's all I've done so far.
R:  Oh, okay, [inaudible] done one about pets -- but, this is a hard topic, but, I do think that it comes right down to what -- exactly what we're discussing, I think it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- comes down to what are the, um -- what are the other stipulations, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] that's the only main stipulation, but, what are the sub stipulations?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of that [several inaudible words] --
L:  I suppose if I had only just known my best friend, you know, for a very short time, and [LIPSMACK] I don't know -- I mean, I can say -- I have more than one best friend, but, when I think of best friends, I think of her, you know, just 'cause --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I've been friends with her for so long, [SIGH] but, I have other friends, and, you know?  Which friend?  [LAUGH]  Are you ta- --
R:  Well, that's true, too.
L:  You know, 'cause I have other friends, too, which -- which friend are -- are you gonna make me choose?  [MN]
R:  Right, and that doesn't necessarily mean that your longest friend is your best friend.
L:  Yeah, I have other friends, too, that I would consider best friends, just -- [SIGH] I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's true, too, and I guess maybe that would be something else -- how would that be determined?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wonder if it would be determined prior to you finding out what's going on -- if there'd be something that would say --
L:  You could never speak --
R:  -- you know, who's your best friend?
L:  -- to this specific person ever again.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that would be kind of a -- an interesting thing.
L:  Yeah, starting right now -- I'll give you a million dollars if you can [MN] -- and, you [inaudible] can never speak to this person right now [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or, you know?  Or, what, you know?
R:  And, I do think that with the kids, and the kids being friends as well, that would make it more difficult if that was the person that you were, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- were choosing to ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, I wonder how many people would actually lie?
L:  Yeah, I mean, [MN] ...
R:  You know?  I wonder what you'd do.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] if I could get away with -- with lying about it -- if, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- getting the money and then, you know, [LIPSMACK] still communicating one way or another with my friend, then, you know, I'd probably do that.
R:  Yeah, and -- and -- and I wonder -- and I wonder how they would monitor something like that, to --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to verify that you actually were not communicating with them in any way --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the -- the internet now, it's kind of a --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yep.
R:  -- you know you could set up an anonymous account -- I mean, I think there'd be ways around it, if -- if, ah --
L:  Yeah, probably.
R:  -- if you could.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  But, I think it probably does come down to whether -- what really does that mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I think it is an interesting topic.
L:  Yeah.  It's ...
R:  Kinda hard to ...
L:  Kinda hard, but, interesting, but, I guess that's the -- that's the idea.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] To get -- to get you talking and thinking about what's going on with it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I think it's interesting -- I think, um -- I like the topics that they give -- they're topics that I wouldn't probably normally talk about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- especially to strangers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on a one to one basis, so, I think that that's, um -- I think that that's kind of an interesting thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know that I had missed, um -- that they have called a few times on my caller ID and I have missed the calls, and I was wondering if they were going to call again, because in the beginning they called, like, every day, for, like, I think five days straight, and then --
L:  [MN] Yeah, I missed, ah -- I missed some, too, because I -- I wasn't home [SIGH] -- I -- you know, there was a couple on my answering machine and I just -- I hadn't -- hadn't been home, so ... [LIPSMACK] but, ah, yeah, I like doing these -- so far, I hope I get, ah,  to do some more [MN] --
R:  I -- yeah --
L:  -- interesting.
R:  -- I filled out that one where they said, "Would you be interested in doing more", and something about -- if you had a choi- -- if you had five phones -- different phones that you could talk from, or something -- I -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I don't know, but, um, yes, I think is one of the most -- more interesting topics -- it'll probably keep me thinking -- it'll give me a subject --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to, ah, talk to other people about, you know, [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, like, my -- oh, I'll ask my -- my best friend about it, next time I talk to her -- I'll [inaudible], "What do you think?  What would you do?".   [LAUGH]
R:  Absolutely, and wouldn't that be interesting to find out what they say?
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely -- I'll probably see her online later tonight, and I'll ask her.
R:  Yeah, I think [inaudible] -- that's a good, um, a good subject for conversation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I'll do the same thing -- I think I'll ask them both.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  What they would do if they had the opportunity.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course, then you kinda put 'em in a -- in a bind if they're talking to you, but, you know, [several inaudible words] --
L:  [inaudible] [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I guess if your -- if your best friend asked you, "What -- would you take a million dollars or would ya stay friends with me?" -- that -- that -- that would be hard to say, "Well, you know ..." -- of course you're gonna say, "Oh no, I'd take you -- you're my best friend".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  But, when you think how many times people start their lives over --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess it could be done -- I just don't know that the million dollars is worth it -- that percent of money would be worth it.
L:  Yeah, I don't know either.
R:  Again, I think -- you know, I think maybe -- oh, I think maybe [MN] twenty -- see, I don't know -- I think maybe for fifty million, I think I would.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think I would take the money.
L:  Yeah, I think -- 
R:  Because I --
L:  -- if it were a -- a really significant amount, I -- I guess it's good ...
