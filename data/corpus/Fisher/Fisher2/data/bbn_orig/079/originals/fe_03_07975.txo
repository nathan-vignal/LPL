L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, how you doing today?
R:  I'm fine, how are you?
L:  Good, good on this hot day.
R:  Oh, hot where you are? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, New York state, so --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I'm in Iowa and it's awfully warm here, too.
L:  Oh, it's hot I'm up near Seneca Lake, near Lake Classic, where they did the Olympics.
R:  Mm.
L:  [MN] So the subject of the day --
R:  Affirmative action.
L:  Yeah.  Hi- hiring a business in the community?
R:  I think it was whether or not it's a good idea in the business community.
L:  What do they mean by that?
R:  I'm not sure. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Whether it's a good idea for who, I guess, maybe they could have clarified.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I suppose if you're, uh, the person who'd get the job because of it, then it's good for you. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know it. [LAUGH]
R:  If you're the person that got passed over, uh, not so good. [LAUGH]
L:  What, is that when they start a new business, or something?  Is a good idea that to live in the community, is that what it means?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm not sure.
L:  I don't know. I --
R:  I think --
L:  -- don't unders-
R:  -- we probably heard the same thing, just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is it a good idea?
L:  Yeah, I think it's good if it's a growing community.  I heard, to -- to start a business and hire and -- oh, what it means, hire the same people in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the community?
R:  I think affirmative action means that you pick who you're going to hire based on things like what race they are.
L:  I don't think that's a good idea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, 'cause -- 'cause, uh, it could be a -- if you want to hire black or this or that, it could be bad.
R:  It can be --
L:  It can start --
R:  -- I think -- I think it's --
L:  -- it can start a riot.
R:  I think it started back when, like, too many non whites were having difficulty getting work and they made some employers have, like, quotas, where, like, such and such percent of your workforce would have to be a minority.  But I --
L:  That --
R:  -- I think, [MN] we've kinda grown past that, I don't -- I don't think we're at a point now where we have to force employers to pick people based on race --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- quotas.
L:  Well, it's called, uh, it's called picking on what kind of job it is and what they're qualified.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can't pick a -- a -- a high school student to work as a security guard or you -- you know -- you know what I'm saying?  Or you can't take a -- a, like a -- a guy that's skilled in computers to work as a police officer, you know, when you take a s- you know what I'm saying?
R:  I think it's more like, if you have two people that are both good at computers and one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of them's black and one of them's white, affirmative action means you automatically pick the black one.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that's not true --
R:  Because you've gotta have so many black workers, you know, percentage wise, out of how many people you have overall.
L:  Well, I want to ask you something, say you got all bu- okay, I'm -- I'm Italian, but anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- say you -- you got a- a- one black or, say, two black workers and one white worker and there was only one job opening, what say the two black workers are not qualified?
R:  Well, the old rules for affirmative action said that the black guys got the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- job anyway.  They had actually hired minorities above people who were more qualified or had more experience.
L:  What's -- you know what I'm saying.
R:  Yeah.  And sometimes that meant that the employer actually ended up with a less qualified employee --
L:  And that hurt -- that can hurt the company and the li-
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the whole business.
R:  Exactly, I mean that can drag your whole business down.
L:  Well, you have two --
R:  I think they need to hire --
L:  -- or if you have two black and two i-
R:  -- whoever's most qualified.
L:  -- or you have two black and two white and the employee is white, what do you do?  You know, you know what I'm saying, say one of each is qualified, you know, they -- you know, it depends what they're looking for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I --
R:  I think they should just hire whoever's most qualified. [SIGH]
L:  And they should hire the first come first served, you know, they're both qualified and they're taking a whole bunch of applications, they got a fea- which person will be feasible.  If you have someone that's qualified that lives in town and someone's qualified, lives seventy five miles away and he has to be there eight o'clock in the morning, who are you going to hire?  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You see, that's gotta be another question, are you going to be there on time every day, or are you going to, you know, at that time in the morning, you -- you know what I'm saying.
R:  Yeah, well that's part of being --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- qualified is being a good worker, being there on time.
L:  You know, and plus, you know, it's, you know, that's the whole thing, you know?  Are you willing to work overtime or you want this, you know, the company is like, like, say, IBM and they -- they, you know, they start before eight o'clock, are you -- could you come in if we need you, like, at four in the morning, depends what the job is.  You know, or something.  Or a phone company or something, you know?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I think those kind of qualifications, it wouldn't matter at all what color or what race the person was.
L:  Yeah, but it also depends on how far you live.  I got a brother works at AT&T and he's a mec- and he's a -- a repairman.  He could be anywhere in New York State, but s- you know, they have certain payments in different states --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in different counties, they're not gonna hire someone that lives in thir- eighty miles away just for that person to, you know what I'm saying?  Unless it's a major emergency.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, you see what I'm saying, it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I don't see that coming that way, I don't see no company or, you know, unless it's -- the, like, a small little stores or something different, 'cause small little stores, sometimes they only hire their own.  Like Chinese restaurants, or, you know, Hispanic stores, you know.  But they usually like to keep it in the family, you know.
R:  Yeah.  And I think that is more about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the families, I don't think they're necessarily hiring --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their own race, I think they're hiring their relatives. [LAUGH]
L:  But when they say it's -- you know, when they put in the paper, "Chinese", they're looking for a sushi chef and it's a Chinese restaurant, who are they really hiring?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are they looking for a Japanese person, or they're looking for an American, you know?  Or a black guy that knows how to do sushi, you see what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Hm.  I do a lot of my work over the Internet and one of the things I like about it is I know that it's a totally level playing field.  They can't see us.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  You know, they don't even know how old we are.  I know some of my colleagues are, you know, home bound because they're in wheelchairs and stuff and you can't tell.
L:  No?
R:  Yeah, unless you get to know them and they tell you, but --
L:  That's true, that's true.  So you ev- [MN] now, I work in Seneca Lake, I work at the -- the Seneca Hotel and that's, like, that's a college town which is Paul Smith and it's a -- it's a -- it's -- it's for a [inaudible] school of cooking and I'm a chef there and the minorities are different, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I assume when they hire a chef that are -- that are older than the kids 'cause they're more experienced, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, it's anyo- it's an equal opportunity, we have everybody, I mean, there's -- you can't say statistically that everyone's even, one year you could have more Hispanics, one year you could have more whites, more Chinese, depend -- 'cause it's a -- it's a college thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the hotel's run by the college, but, you know, anyone can rent a room there, you know and all that, s- but it's a s- it's a minority, it depends what the maids are, you know, some you have all black, some you have mix, you know -- you know, it's a seasonal thing.
R:  So, they're kinda hiring whatever they have most available.
L:  Available, that's it and what their job is qualified for.  And I stay there year round but there's people actually come and go --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, 'cause working for a [inaudible] a little different --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's we- you know, like, yeah, they want more demanding from us [inaudible].  When a -- I work in the restaurant part there, it's for the public --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, but we're having a dispute because, you know, I'm the one's making the money and showing the students what to do, you don't like it, I'll leave, I got -- you know, I'm forty five, got twenty years' experience.  I'm certified, I can work anywhere in the world, I'm a trained chef, so, you know, when you're certified you pay a license, I'm on the Internet, so it's like, you know, [MN] but I chose to stay there, it's convenient for my house.
R:  Hm.
L:  Plus, you know, it's s- s- I've been there for ten years, so I have arguments with them, and w- one time he told me to walk off, I walk off, he begged for me to come back.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because the council, they thanked me, the students thanked me.  I pull no gripes, no pulls, but I'm fair.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have to do test it's -- 'cause, you know, most of -- are set, you know, a- as a teacher, I make it up to them.  You know, there's a way of doing it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they need one credit, I can make it up on Saturdays, you know, as long as you make that quota, no --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- problem, you know?
R:  You have a quota, as a chef?
L:  Well, for their -- for their -- for their, to cooking and all that, what they have to test on, like, say they gotta learn so much in six weeks and they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're falling really behind, I'll push them on a Saturday, they're really w- they're -- I can really see they're doing them, or some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of them and I have s- so- about three people I gradua- have graduated from that.
R:  So, you're teaching other people to be chefs?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's neat.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I don't cook, I microwave. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, believe me, I do microwave as well, so you can make a lot of stuff, you know? [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know this -- you can coo- you can be a chef as a microwave chef, believe it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or not, there is.  There's cookbooks out there to cook in a microwave.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know.
R:  Hm.
L:  You can pu- cook a home made gour- meal in a microwave, believe it or not.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, it's [LAUGH] believe it or not, it's quicker than on the stove --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause you don't have that mess, there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  There's something --
R:  I think we got off topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I think we drifted --
L:  I'm sorry --
R:  -- off topic. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I apologize.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry, we -- I think we both got off, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- minorities, it's like that in the college, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  What are you going to do when, you know, teachers that are hir- that you hire are minorities that you, uh, you know, that's like, hi- like hiring for college work, summertime work.
R:  Well, there was a big flap in the papers recently about one college that was using affirmative action standards about who they would let in as students --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- not just who they would hire.
L:  Remember that movie they made a few years ago, about that black student that went to an all white college 'cause he went on a -- a -- athletic scholarship?  They made a movie out of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's like that.
R:  Hm.
L:  Who they want, who they don't want, who they want to hire, oh it goes -- it's still going on, we probably don't even hear about it, the small businesses obviously do research.
R:  I bet you don't, I -- I bet we basically don't hear about it unless somebody doesn't get the job they want and then they --
L:  Or a big --
R:  -- complain and --
L:  -- time company that keep a cover over it.  We're going to -- we don't get this job, but then when you're ready to sue they give them so much money and hire ma- and hire man away for -- to keep him on.
R:  Yeah.  We don't hear about little stuff like that until --
L:  No.
R:  -- the lawsuit's filed. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, no. [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  No.  Yeah, this is my third call doing this, so I ca- I can't call no more, huh?
R:  I don't think so. [NOISE] I think it's just three.
L:  Three.
R:  How close together were your first two?
L:  Not that close.
R:  Did you get paid for either of them? [NOISE]
L:  No.  They said I --
R:  See, I didn't --
L:  -- gotta call --
R:  -- get paid for my first one, it was over a month ago.
L:  I didn't get nothing.
R:  Hm.
L:  You gotta do three phone calls.  Was it in a month, or just, uh, spread it apart?
R:  I think it's just three before the whole thing's over.
L:  For -- for my calling or the whole program?
