L:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Emily.
R:  Hi, Emily.  I'm [inaudible] Jane Huddle.  I'm in Kitchener, Ontario so I'm not in United States.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Oh, that's beautiful.
L:  Unfortunately not so beautiful today.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is it not? 
L:  It's a little grey.
R:  Oh.  We're very -- well, we're too warm up here.  Very, very hot.
L:  How hot is it?
R:  Uh, it's -- well, today it's about twenty seven and we were up as high as thirty five.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Not bad [MN] for Canada.
L:  And then, I guess, probably most of you guys up there don't really have air conditioning 'cause you don't normally need it, right?
R:  Oh, no, no.  We have a -- -- we're full of air conditioning.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, our -- our cars and everything.
L:  That's good.
R:  Yeah.  No, we do get very hot.  [MN] [MN]
L:  Ugh.
R:  But we also get very cold.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'll tell you.  We've had some hot weather here lately.
R:  Is that right, ay?  How high did you go?
L:  Um --
R:  Oh, you don't know our -- our numbers, do you?  [LIPSMACK] Okay, today it's about eighty --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we've been up to about ninety four.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, we've been up to, I think, ninety seven was our hottest day so far.
R:  Oh, man.  
L:  Ick.
R:  Oh, dear.  [SIGH]
L:  Not any fun that.
R:  Do you have kids in school?
L:  No, but I've been in public school --
R:  Oh, y- --
L:  -- here in the US.
R:  Sure.  I bet.  We hear a lot about the difference in the systems between Canada and United States.
L:  It's pretty bad here.  Um [LAUGH] I can tell you as an insider, um, I mean I went to class with people a- and graduated with people who were really at only basic reading levels.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, we're -- we're illiterate for a -- you know, for all meanings of the word.  And these were people who graduated from the public school that I attended.  You know, you just wonder, how can people like that make it through the rest of their lives -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- when they barely even read --
R:  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  -- you know, much less do, you know, basic math et cetera?
R:  But, Emily, would they go on then?  Like you have college, we have univers- we have university and college.  Would they go on?
L:  No, no, these people --
R:  That would be the end.
L:  No, they wouldn't be going on to -- to further education.  I mean, they're just -- you know, th- the reason that people [MN] don't do well is because they're not interested and they certainly wouldn't subject themselves to more years in school.
R:  No.  [SIGH] But is it the teaching system that forces them not to be interested?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, absolutely.  I mean, um, I was put in a lot of the honors classes and the advanced classes but I had teachers who, because they didn't know what to do with someone like me, um --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- [MN] you know, I -- I had a geography teacher who brought me, um, Xeroxes of maps and let me color them.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Because I already knew everything that was in the textbook.  You know, because they have to teach towards the lowest common denominator.
R:  Y- y- yeah.
L:  Which is people who really cannot understand.  You know, they're simply n- -- you know.  I hate to say it but there are people who -- out here, who just don't have a lot of intellect and [MN] unfortunately the public schools, because the way they're set up, have to teach towards those people, and anyone who is at average or better understanding, um, you know, is -- is bored out of their minds.  A- another --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- teacher that I had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, actually had me grading the exams that she'd given to people two grades above me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I'd already read more books than anyone else in the class and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, either that or she passes to go to the library.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, so --
R:  So, you're defeated too.  
L:  Oh --
R:  I mean y- --
L:  -- absolutely.
R:  Ya, y- you're not getting anything offered to you on your level.
L:  Absolutely.  I mean I -- I didn't get [LAUGH] -- I didn't get anything out of school.  I mean, everything that I've learned I have self taught.
R:  And did you go on then?  Have you gone into college and things?
L:  It -- I have, um, attended college.  Two different ones actually but I haven't gotten a degree.  I think that also that was part of -- of not really getting a good education in public school.  I never really, um, [MN] developed an interest in any particular subject.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so now I'm in college and going, "Okay, well what should I get a major in?"  I've got, you know -- I've got basically four years of college but no major because I just --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- keep trying things and trying things and hoping that there's something --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that will interest me enough to -- you know, to wanna get a major in it but, you know, in high school I certainly had no, um, y- you know, real interest in any one thing because again there wasn't anything interesting --
R:  No.
L:  -- about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you don't really have much of a guidance department like we do here?
L:  Oh, no, there's nothing like that here.  [LAUGH]
R:  And do you take te- -- you don't take take tests to find out what your interests are?  Like they've got all kinds of tests here the kids take and it determines [MN] or [MN] --
L:  Not -- not in a high school --
R:  -- where their interest is.
L:  -- level.  Mm mm.  Um, I actually took --
R:  Gosh.
L:  -- something like that at one of the colleges that I attended.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, just because I was again trying to figure out some sort of a major.  And, um, it was the strong interest test.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but I mean that was the first time I'd been exposed to anything like that and ...
R:  See our kids are exposed to that by grade nine.
L:  Wow.
R:  Which was about fif- -- it'd be about fifteen years old.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they've just now converted from a grade thirteen system to the grade twelve system.
L:  Mhm.
R:  This is in -tario.  Other provinces have been grade twelve for years.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  But they've just converted over but our kids have a lot of guidance.
L:  So for thirteen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- grades, does that mean an extra year at the beginning or the end?
R:  The end.
L:  Okay.  So your kids go to school until they're nineteen or dead?
R:  Um, well, yeah, I -- now it would be eighteen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then you'd go on to either college or university.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That kind of thing.  Now, what about public -- er, not public school, but what about private school?  Do a lot of people go to private schools instead of public school system?
L:  They do.  Actually, um, I've been to public as well as private.  Um, unfortunately you see some of the same problems in the private --
R:  It's not --
L:  -- schools.
R:  -- any better.
L:  It -- well, it is to some extent but you've got -- you've -- you've got a handful of bad teachers in the private system as well.  Um, I think there's a -- a larger number of bad teachers in the public system but, um, I spent my middle school years at one of the better public, er, private schools here --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in Atlanta and, um, did really, really well there.  Enjoyed myself immensely.  You know, and the way that they work, or at least this one worked, is that you basically learned at your own pace.  So, if you were in --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- third grade and were at seventh grade reading level, or whatever, that's what they gave you.
R:  Right.
L:  So that worked really well for me but unfortunately I had an older brother who had [SIGH] a less than wonderful experience at that school and, um, [MN] you know, I was young at the time, middle school, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, he was older and my parents wanted to take him out and because I wasn't driving they had to take me out as well simply because they couldn't --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, get us both to different schools.
R:  Yeah, the transportation end of it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Well, w- --
L:  So ...
R:  How can they improve this, Emily?  What can they do?  I mean, w- we're not that bad.  Our kids really aren't.  They may goof off and, you know, th- the materialism's coming in more now.  Kids are getting very spoiled and they see some on TV, they gotta have it.  So, a lot of that and a lot of kids are, um, latch key kids.  That means the parents aren't home after school.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  And stuff like that but still I think we're stronger.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think, um, you know, it was interesting when -- when I heard the announcement of the topic, you know, and what can you do to improve it.  I mean the education reforms that this country needs are just so incredibly large.  I mean, it's hard to even imagine, you know --
R:  Yeah, how do they start --
L:  -- the -- the sole solution.
R:  -- to change, right?
L:  Exactly.  I think one of the big things that they could do is do the voucher system, which allows people to send their kids to private school.  They use -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, the public school here is paid for via property taxes or whatever.
R:  Right.
L:  And, um, a lot of people talk about starting a system where you get a voucher for the amount that your public school education is costing and you take the voucher to a --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- private institution.
R:  Ya.
L:  And the reason that that would make more sense to me is because, [NOISE] you know, it's more of a -- it's more of a -- like a market economy that way.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, um, if -- if -- in a private school, if you're paying, you know, nine thousand dollars a year or more, which is very likely here.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, you know if you've got teachers who are, you know, inadequate, y- the parents --
R:  [MN] Yeah.
L:  -- will complain and -- and those people will be replaced simply --
R:  And --
L:  -- because --
R:  -- and it does work like that.  
L:  Exactly, you know.
R:  It does.  You can say something and they have to pay attention to you because --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- they don't have the income if they don't pay attention to you.
L:  Exactly, but unfortunately with your public schools, they're taking that money from you regardless of whether you even have a student in the school
R:  That's right.
L:  So they don't have to be accountable to anyone.
R:  No.
L:  And so that --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that would be, I think, my big first step would be to -- to institute this voucher system because then when everyone's taking their kids out of the public schools, they'll finally have to do something about it.  They'll see --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- that, you know, the state that it's in that --
R:  And it's going to --
L:  -- there's really no alternative but to start making reforms --
R:  Right.
L:  -- internally.
R:  And they'll have to improve the teachers themselves.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I mean, boy oh boy, if that isn't a key.  And what we are finding here too, are teachers are getting -- oh, [MN] well, they simply haven't -- the morals and everything are different now, you know, like the old --
R:  Absolutely.
