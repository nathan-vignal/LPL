R:  Uh, hi, this is Sandy.
L:  Hi.  What di- uh, my name is Jeri.  What is yours again?
R:  Um, Sandy.
R:  Sandy?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, good.  Well, I, uh, the m- let's clarify our question: how is affirmative action, is it good in the employment --
R:  Right --
L:  -- field --
R:  --that's right.
L:  -- or not?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ha- um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think that, um, I think yes and no. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think that people should be qualified --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the position that they're doing and if they only base it on do- you know, how many races have to be in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the workplace, [MN] to equal some quota, [LIPSMACK] um, I think [MN] that could make it difficult.
R:  [NOISE] Um, do you think it -- do you think it should be a factor at all?
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, seems to me, like --
L:  I think --
R:  -- it should be --
L:  -- I think it should be, I think there should be no discrimination --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that -- that would be unfair and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wrong --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, and cre- would create a -- a bad o- uh, work atmosphere and should be illegal, but I think you should be qualified for the work you're doing. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [NOISE] So, well, uh, yeah, I mean I -- I -- I think I agree with you, be- because, I mean, if you -- if you're looking -- let's say you're looking for -- for a -- a s- uh, you know, a scientist for a particular job, obviously you want to get the best possible scientist that you can -- that you can get.  Um --
L:  Right --
R:  -- but perhaps --
L:  -- 'cause you're looking --
R:  -- if you're looking for --for somebody who's going to -- going to be a -- a, you know, be -- be taking my order --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at Wendy's, um, [NOISE] you know, maybe some form of, uh, of, uh, assistance to people who may not have had that kind of background, maybe -- maybe in order, I don't know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, [SIGH] ha- [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from the employer's point of view, [LIPSMACK] they have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to have a qualified person.
R:  Sure.
L:  From the employee's point of view --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there wi- there can be things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, um, [LIPSMACK] pregnancy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean it doesn't have to be just skin color and I don't think affirmative --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- action just deals with -- with, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] different, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nationalities, but it also deals --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] the [MN] -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- condition of a -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- employee's s- uh, right, yeah -- unless I'm mistaken, doesn't do- isn't that also included? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think they're all included, I think it's -- it's, [NOISE] what does it say, race, color, ethnic origin --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sexual preference, there's a whole list of them these days that go on --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and on.
L:  -- yeah.  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so, um, I -- yeah, I think that it has to be, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- dealt with and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] if they're just sticking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to hiring one nationality and they're discriminating, then I think there's a need for the affirmative action to come --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- into play --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and legal -- legal, um, m- matters taken into hand.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're a free country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but we're supposed to be a fair country too. [LAUGH]
R:  Sure.  Sure.  Um --
L:  So --
R:  -- [NOISE] but -- but do -- do you think that if an employer does that he is being unfair, [NOISE] I mean, it -- it might be that he's being unfair to -- to somebody if he's using, uh, using his preferences, you know, using a -- a particular group and union preference.
L:  Well, I think it depends on how it affects, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] th- the soc- oo, I want to say society, but, the things around --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] like, the people and the businesses around them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be- because there can be small, family operated businesses --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they just want to hire family and people closely related and I think that's -- that's all well and good and [MN] -- and they shouldn't -- they should not have to hire, um, someone outs- ha- outside -- an outsider --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in those situations and, um, [LIPSMACK] I think it -- it can be used unfairly at times, um, and I think it [NOISE] -- that really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] gets left up to a judge when --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- when someone decides to, you know, call them on it or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or, uh, say it's unfair.
R:  Right, so, it could be unfair to the employer and it could be unfair to somebody who didn't get the job both, what do you think?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, because em- employer should be allowed to choose people that he wants to choose, um --
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then there's the personality, uh, that comes into --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- play, you know, what kind of personality gets along with the other people --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- in the business, so, [LIPSMACK] I mean there's all kinds of businesses [LAUGH] --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- tha- uh, that we could -- we could view, um, [LIPSMACK] I haven't had a lot of experience with, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- haven't read a lot about affirmative action in the workplace, so I'm not -- not as knowledgeable about what -- what has taken place, I just know what my personal opinion is, I think, um, you know --
R:  So, you just get to read --
L:  -- a firi-
R:  -- a -- a --
L:  -- oo, sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  You go ahead, go ahead.
L:  Well, I was just going to say that I think if someone is, uh, fired or laid off, [MN] [LIPSMACK] due to an unfairness that is related to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] their nationality or sexual origin or their, um, um, [SIGH] family status and by that I'm -- I'm thinking of, in particular, someone who might be pregnant and needs -- needs a little, um, [LIPSMACK] a little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- care, [LAUGH] you know, and that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- has to [MN] has to be, uh, in a -- I want to say a tender --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- situation --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] and that they should not have to lose their job be- because of something that's temporary.  Um, although child rearing isn't temporary, but there is -- there's daycare and it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would not fair to lose a job because you're pregnant --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, and they're worried about the time that you're going to be off for your pregnancy, because there's all types of situations that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- could play in the same [MN] --
R:  Well, they could put --
L:  -- take away --
R:  -- the employer --
L:  -- the same amount of time, family --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dea- death in the family, um, uh, just an --
L:  -- injury, if somebody gets in a auto accident, they could have the same amount of time off or -- or more, and, um, I think there needs to be a sensitivity, [MN] -- to --
R:  But what's their employer to do if that happens, I mean, you know, if he --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, took three months if he needs to, you know, if he's -- by the time he hires and re- trains a replacement, um -- [NOISE]
L:  Well, three months, I don't kno- I -- dep- I think it depends on how long the person is planning on taking off.  I don't know if -- if, um, generally the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- time would be that -- quite that long.  Um, I would say, you know, family planning does come in play there and you -- you -- you'd have to know that if you're gonna take longer than, um, four weeks off, four to six weeks off, um, that you -- you might know you were in a precarious position, but, like I said, you never know what's gonna happen, it could be a hard pregnancy and you might need three months, but then again, um, um, an auto accident could take someone away for an even longer period of time, but that's -- 
R:  Sure.
L:  -- what we have a disability insurance for, so, um, but I -- you know --
R:  [NOISE] But --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- surely, we can't really balance that that you, uh -- you know, because the employer's going to say, "Look, I need to get somebody, you know, I got my job to get -- uh, the work got to get done, like that's what's have to be", but after -- but the employee says, "Well, you know, I got my life [NOISE] to run as well".
L:  Well, I -- as an example, I [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know why I keep getting stuck on the pregnancy thing, but I have, um, in my realm on experience, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I bank at a certain bank and there is an employee there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- who ...
