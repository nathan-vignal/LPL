R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello, this is Gina Geraldino.
L:  [SIGH] And this is Stephanie Stacy.
R:  O- okay.
L:  And --
R:  Ah, I missed the question.  Did you hear that?
L:  Um, it's, uh [NOISE] what do you think's seriously wrong with the, uh -- the public school system?  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Which is terrible.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?
L:  I've got two kids in it and I know how bad it is.
R:  Yeah.  Um, well [NOISE] I think [NOISE] if we get the gover- the government out of it, it would be a lot better.
L:  Well, I think if the government --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- would just give, er -- pay the teachers a little bit more to go and pay attention to the students, I think they'd do a little bit better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And I think they're way underfunded anyway in the fact that they're going and [LIPSMACK] uh, [MN] cutting all these extra c- curricular activities out isn't doing them any good either for the fact that that's what keeps the kids' interest in school.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, yeah, I guess I agree with that.  But, uh, it seems like they're [MN] -- sometimes they're doing two much curricular -- extra curricular activities and not enough study too.
L:  Well, that is true but usually if you can keep it down to a minimum, it usually keeps them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- level headed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- considering they are cutting so much of the funds and putting it into other things, [LIPSMACK] I think it's totally wrong.
R:  Yeah, um, what things do you think they should have it into or --
L:  Well, I think they --
R:  -- that they're putting it in?
L:  -- should go and p- keep it into [MN] the, er, schools.  I think the -- I don't think it's helping them going and cutting the curricular activities for the fact that that is what's -- one of things that keeps a kid motivated in going to school.
R:  Mm.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know if I agree with you because, uh, these -- the --the kids today, it seems like they're -- w- why should they need motivation anyway.  I mean they're there.  They act like to be entertained.
L:  Well, true.  [LAUGH]
R:  Instead of get an education, you know?
L:  Yeah, I completely, uh -- I completely believe that one.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Kentucky.
R:  Are ya?  I could tell by your accent.  [LAUGH]
L:  Always.
R:  [MN] Sounds good.  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I'm running out of things to say.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  This is the first time I've done this.
L:  And where are you from?
R:  South Dakota.
L:  How's the schools there?
R:  Oh, they're the same as everywhere else, uh --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
R:  [MN]
L:  I live in a very small town like five hundred people if you're lucky.  [LIPSMACK] And it's like unless you know the teacher very well and if you're not [MN] well, uh, known as in having money, you don't get much of an education any way.
R:  Is that right?  Oh.
L:  Because it's all in "who you are" around here.
R:  It's all what?
L:  It's all in who you are.
R:  Is that right?  Oh, well, that's the way it is, I guess, in a small town.
L:  And if you're not a snot that goes and wears the best clothes and has a big, rich mommy and daddy, you are pretty much ignored.
R:  Wow.
L:  Because I've known kids that are brilliant that they try to go and put in like special education classes and they're like, "We can't put 'em in here because they scored way too high".  They're just wanting them out, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then I sc- --
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's -- that's one of the other problems is this -- oh, can't think of what you call it now.  Because I don't have kids in school right now.  My -- I've got a grandson but, um --
L:  You sound too young.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, um, [MN] [SIGH] where they don't, you know?  Oh, I forgot what you call it.  Where they don't let the kids, uh, you know, excel?  The smarter ones are held back.
L:  Yes.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  What's that called?
L:  Well, see, I have a five year old daughter going into first grade.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you have to know exactly -- you have to know all the teachers before you can find the one that you know that's going to be best suited for your child, on teaching it, for the fact that usually it's who you are, not how good you are.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's not right.
L:  I went through the school system myself.  I know exactly how it is.  My mother being a janitor and a bus driver, I wasn't very much, uh --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- they didn't really try with me.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, when your mother's like that and your father's a night guard somewhere they just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you don't have the money and wear the best of the best clothes.  You're ju- you're ignored round here.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So, now my mother, now that she's got [MN] -- you know, saved up enough money where she can do that, she makes sure my little sister, which is only nine years old, going on ten, has the best clothes so she is paid attention to and she has actually been taught to the point that [SIGH] in the school system now where she's like scoring the highest in her grade on like the, er, erm, er, the [MN] -- the intelligence test.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And last year when, you know, mom didn't really pay attention to what she wore as well, they went and tried to put her in, uh, like a remedial class because they said she wasn't smart enough.
R:  Oh, my --
L:  It's just --
R:  -- gosh.
L:  -- depends on who the teacher is around here --
R:  That's terrible.
L:  -- in these schools --
R:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
L:  -- for 'em to go and get any attention whatsoever.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a pitiful place to be.
R:  Are you near a big town?  I mean, are --
L:  [LAUGH] No, not even close.
R:  Not even close, huh?
L:  Not even close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean the nearest larger city is like two and a half, three hours away and that's [inaudible] Kentucky.
R:  Ah, yeah, well ...
L:  And I'm like four hours from Lexington[?], Kentucky [MN].
R:  [LAUGH] You have to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you have to go there to do your shopping I suppose, huh?  Or can you in your small town?
L:  Well, we -- we have a Walmart about an hour away.
R:  Yeah, well, I don't know what the answer is.  But I -- I sure don't agree with the -- the NEA seems to be ...
L:  The public --
R:  [MN] [MN] [MN]
L:  -- school system.  It just depends on where you are on how bad they are.  I truly believe.
R:  Yeah, huh.
L:  Unless of course, I think they should go and make it more closely to [LIPSMACK] giving each school the same amount, instead of being one school getting so much when a poorer county next door gets less, and a richer county gets more, for the fact that they have more taxes coming in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [SIGH] 'Cause I know h- -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's [MN] kind of how it is around here too.  
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it's a dilemma.
L:  [LAUGH] I've ran out of things to say, I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah.  Are we supposed to be on here for ten minutes.
L:  We're supposed to talk about it for at least eight minutes and, uh, the other two minutes we can --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- say pretty much anything I think.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  But we have to speak about it for at least eight minutes to get paid the ten dollars.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um ...
L:  Um [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  Well, I don't know.  [NOISE] Uh, what do you think of, uh, President Bush, what he's doing with the [MN] -- with the public schools or do you think he's helping any?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think his wife's helping in that more than he -- he -- he is.  Because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she's more into it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's the one that's actually going to the schools and talking to the students and, you know, trying to motivate 'em.
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  I don't think he --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- really goes and keeps a good interest in that part of it.  I think she's the one who does it all.  Just like C- with Clinton and his wife done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That seems to be how it is.  They always put the women in there.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let them go and do that since it must be a girl thing to do.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I guess, yeah.  Reagan's wife did the same thing.
L:  M- yeah -- most of them do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the men just kind of ignore it and let their women do it [MN].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like it's not important, you know?  It's our k- --
L:  Well, like they say --
R:  -- it's our future.
L:  -- behind every good man is a good woman.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, you know, [MN] [MN] [inaudible] -- well, the women has always been the one to fill in [MN] -- take care of the children and help raise them and [LIPSMACK] be the main motivator in 'em and so I guess, that's why they do it [MN].
R:  Yeah, yeah.  
L:  [MN] [PAUSE]
R:  Well, oh --
L:  Um ...
R:  I can't think of anything else to say either.
L:  Well, these -- these schools around here are getting a little bit better year by year as the o- the students get in there that start teaching and they know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how they are so --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- they're finally starting to convert over because they knew how they were treated when they were younger.
R:  Yeah, I know my husband has some high school kids working for him and they can miss school for [NOISE] days and days and days and the school doesn't tell the parents, you know.  S- they don't even --
L:  Well, my child went and mi- w- well she was late for school, um [LIPSMACK] a couple of times, like three and four times and they already had a truancy off- -- getting ready to send a letter to a truancy officer so --
R:  Really?
L:  -- it's bad around here for when you miss any.
R:  Oh, well, that's good you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I think it's terrible the way they do here.  
L:  Because I mean --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you miss so many day- -- I mean, even if you sign out early, it's considered a absence.  Therefore after you leave early a couple of days, they're sending you a letter saying, "You're gonna be -- you're getting a letter sent to the truancy officer if your kid misses any more school".
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it's a good thing there.  Scares --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the p- the parents into making them get up and go on time.
R:  Yeah, yeah, the, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- parents around here need to get to the school board meetings and get -- get it changed.  The way it is now because --
L:  [NOISE] Well, see, I'm one of those parents that's right in there talking to the teacher at least once a week to make sure I know exactly wh- how my child is doing.  Not many --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of 'em do that.
R:  I know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like they went and put my daughter in a class that --
