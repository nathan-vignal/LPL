R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name is Barbara.  [NOISE] 
L:  Barbara, my name is Brooke.
R:  [NOISE] Brooke, hi.
L:  Yeah, how are you doing?
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, huh, do you have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- children?
R:  Yes, do you?
L:  No, I don't.  I was just curious, um, if you did, if they attend public schools.
R:  [COUGH] I have two children and one just graduated from public school and another one is sixteen [PAUSE] and we --
L:  And -- and the other is sixteen?
R:  Sixteen.
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible].  How do you feel about [NOISE] their --
R:  Well, uh --
L:  -- k- education?  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I'm happy with our public school situation.  We have, um, one of the best in the state.  So, I -- I know there are really bad public schools but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- mine isn't [LAUGH] so, huh.
L:  Yeah, yeah, like you say, you know.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, no, I -- I don't have children but I do have a, um -- a younger brother and I have, um -- have a, yeah -- several friends with children and --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  A- -- I -- just it sort of disappoints me that there's not more arts and music, um, in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the public schools, uh, that are offered to our children.
R:  Well, um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] if ya -- in our public school system if you want to, um -- well, actually our school is -- has a lot of music.  [MN] H- huge amount --
L:  Wonderful.
R:  -- of music in our school, um --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Can you hear me?
R:  Are you on a cellphone?
L:  Yeah, on a, um, [inaudible].  Now, I'm on a ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can you wait just a minute?
R:  Aye.
L:  Uh, okay.  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  It'll get better in a second.
R:  Uh, and how old are you?
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] Can you hear me now?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I'm fine.
R:  How old are you?  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Hello?  [SIGH]
L:  How old am I?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Wait a second.  I'm trying to get [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- I'm trying to get to -- mm, closer to the base of the phone.  I'm fine.
R:  That's all right.  So, how old --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are you?
L:  I'm twenty four.
R:  And did you go to public school?
L:  Yes, I did.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I went to, um, a lot of public schools.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I've been moved --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- around a lot.
R:  Oh.
L:  I got -- when I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- growing up and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um ...
R:  [NOISE] Do you think you got a good education?
L:  Um, I -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think I could've gotten [SIGH] better --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, um, I'm happy with it like [MN] [MN] because I went to so many different --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- schools.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I got to really see what they had to [NOISE] -- you know, how each one -- how they each taught differently.  
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  'Cause the one -- the ones that were located --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more in the rural areas, um, were [MN] -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- I went to school in Alabama.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot of the time so like r- -- in the real rural country.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  And in the public schools they had very, very little [NOISE] to, um, offer outside of --
R:  Right.
L: -- your basic, um, classes.
R:  Right.
L:  And they were u- usually it was, [MN] you know, way too many students per --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- per teacher so it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was very hard to get any individual attention there.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I imagine that's probably changed now.  Because in order for them to get public -- I mean, federal mo- um, assistance, you know, matching, they ha- they have to meet a certain requirement of how many students per teacher.
L:  Right.
R:  Had to document it all now so it -- hopefully it's improved.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Where -- where do you live?  Where do --
R:  Mm, I live in Louisiana but I went -- [MN] I went to public school in Maryland when I grew up.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE] And [NOISE] one -- you know, [NOISE] that was the [NOISE] Washington [NOISE] suburbs [NOISE] and that was a really [NOISE] good school [NOISE] system.  [NOISE]
L:  Right, right.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm in, uh, California --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- now and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- from what I hear, the -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the public schools are -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people are happy with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I -- I wish that there was more funding for --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for education.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I find it a shame that like, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- private schools tend to have more to offer.
R:  [NOISE] D- do you really --
L:  And they --
R:  -- think that?
L:  Um, I -- I think --.
R:  Private --
L:  -- so.
R:  -- schools?
L:  Some private --
R:  Like religious private schools?
L:  Um, no, more like arts magnet schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, there -- there's a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] -- well, in Montgomery there are two, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- private schools and they're associated with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- art.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Magnet arts --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- and with dance --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and theatre and [SIGH] I just -- yeah.
R:  Mm, well, we have --
L:  Good.
R:  -- we have one of those in the New Orleans area.  It's a, um, public school for arts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] Like [several inaudible words] I said it, you know, varies wherever.  All over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- h- you know what you can find as far as arts --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and music.  [NOISE]
L:  And where you are.
R:  Mm?
L:  And just where you are.  Where you are located.
R:  Uh, I'm in the New Orleans area.  In the suburbs.
L:  Right, right.  I'm just saying that that really makes a difference, I think.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What type of schooling you get.  [SIGH] Yeah.  Have you -- have you done this, um, before?  This survey?
R:  I did one.  How about you?
L:  I [MN] did one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh ...
R:  And, uh, where did you hear f- -- about it from?
L:  Um, a friend of mine here in California just, uh -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she's done it a couple of times.
R:  Mhm.
L: And, uh, mentioned it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I -- I said, "Okay".  So, I'm not very good at talking to [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- strangers [LAUGH] or to people I don't know.  It's hard for me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  It's hard to talk about something that you don't feel passionate about, for ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  So I apologize if I'm not communicating --
R:  Well, that's okay.
L:  -- really well.
R:  [SIGH] Well, anyway.
L:  And ...
R:  Public school.  [NOISE] Go back to that again.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, y- y- you can do well in public school or -- or you could do, [NOISE] you know, poorly.  Just like at a private school.  [NOISE] Actually, our private school in the area, they're, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- p- Catholic schools and [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh, right.
R:  -- we looked into them but, um [NOISE] [NOISE] uh, [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE] [NOISE] um, [NOISE] um, sorry, I interrupted, well, um [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] the -- the teachers in the Catholic school don't have as higher education as the teachers in our public schools here.  A lot of our --
L:  Yeah, and they're ver- -- that's true.  I -- I --
R:  Yeah, so we really felt that the education was better in -- in a public school.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  With some in the, um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the -- the private schools, like as far as the relig- -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- private religious schools.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I don't. 
R:  No.
L:  I wouldn't recommend.  I wouldn't --
R:  No.
L:  -- send my child to those over public schools.
R:  No.  I wouldn't either.
L:  [MN]
R:  But in New Orleans, th- those are the better s- -- Catholic schools are the better schools 'cause the schools in New Orleans are really pretty bad.  [NOISE] I think that ev- -- even the teachers have a hard time [NOISE] passing their entrances[?] in any kind of exams.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  T- -- it's a -- it's all a mess but, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] um, I hope the way [MN] it'll -- they'll fix it up.  Ah, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] it depends on where you live really.  What's gonna [MN] -- how good your school is.
L:  Right, because where my brother goes to school. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] [MN] I guess, had a [several inaudible words] and it's a -- some of the teachers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they don't -- they don't even have enough teachers to teach, um -- 
R:  [NOISE] [NOISE]
L:  -- they'll have to combine classes some days or they'll --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not be able to, uh, have their library period --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because, uh, there aren't enough teacher's aides and its due to the lack of money to pay the teachers that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't have more teachers.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Wow.
L:  A- and to start with there's just so little culture, oh, you know, in the country.  Er, gotta be things for kids to get out and to do and to like keep their interest in [MN] you know, they end up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of 'em dropping out of school [inaudible] and it's not having outside interests.  And their [NOISE] parents unfortunately don't --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- have a very high -- you know, a lot of them, not all of them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a lot of 'em don't have a very high education themselves.
R:  Right.
L:  It's hard for them to keep --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- and m- m- m- motivated to stay in school.
R:  Right, right, well, you know, it's not all the teacher's job and the school's job [inaudible].  You know, it's -- a lot of it's the parent's job.
L:  Yeah, it is.  Absolutely.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] That's the problem with New Orleans, a lot of the parents, um, mm, [NOISE] they just, uh -- it's not a -- school's not a priority for them and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't send their kids to school all the time and [SIGH] they expect --
L:  Yeah, don't really push the issue.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  If they wanna go, they can go.  If not ...
R:  [NOISE] Right, right.  And then they complain because the kids [NOISE] aren't passing their -- their, er, you know, exams so they can pass onto the next grade level.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well.  [NOISE] Yeah, that's gotta be a -- it's gotta be, uh, a priority in the home or [NOISE] else the kids -- it's very hard for the kids to do well.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I [MN] [MN].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like if they're parents aren't trying to ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- continuing education then --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
L:  No.
R:  So, on the whole it sounds like we're both [several inaudible words]--
