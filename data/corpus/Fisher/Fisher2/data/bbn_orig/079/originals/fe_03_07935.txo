L:  Hello?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, h- hello?  Ah, my name is Max.  [SIGH]  Ah, I wanted to speak to you in reference to the a public school situation.  [NOISE]  Ah, in my estimation I think that the public schools, [SIGH] ah, -- the, ah, [SIGH] -- the classroom sizes should be cut in half.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  More funds should be available for public schools and, ah, [SIGH] they should have more teachers and more hours and, ah, if necessary have --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] have, ah, classes in the summertime.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Well, Max, my name is Paula and, um, I agree with most of what you say.  Um, they could use a lot more resources.  [SIGH]  I know funding is also a problem and I know, um, [SIGH] teachers' pay and the fact that, um, [SIGH] health insurance is such a large expense -- expense these days and, um, it's difficult for, um, t- the money, you know, to be found to do these things.  [SIGH]  I think we have some excellent public schools.  I still really believe in the public school system ... and w- would still want my children to be in the public school system.
R:  [NOISE]  Well, I agree with you in that respect but I also believe that, um, [NOISE] [SIGH] ah, you know, you have a lot -- a lot of c- children that are not just rowdy [SIGH] but, ah, they cause harm to other students [NOISE] in the schools.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And a lot of students --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- can't learn because [NOISE] of these rowdy, ah -- ah, rowdy, ah children.  [SIGH] What I -- what I believe what they should do is what they had, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, good many years ago.  [NOISE]  And that is they -- special schools for rowdy children, [SIGH] ah, where they can teach them, ah, m- more discipline, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] ah, better behavior [SIGH] and, ah, students that want to learn, can learn.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, just hold them responsible for their behavior and if a child has a learning disability that causes ... t- them to be disruptive and they can't obey the rules [SIGH] I agree that some sp- -- um, some special [SIGH] classroom should be available for them to function in ... as long as they can, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, h- have some special h- help that will ... get them to be able to participate.  Because all children, even if they have a disability, [SIGH] should be allowed to, um, attend public schools.  [SIGH]  But, um, you're right, ah, in that situation a teacher would need a much smaller classroom [SIGH] and some special training for dealing with those kinds of students.
R:  Yeah, I agree with you, ah, i- in the respect that, ah, some s- -- some children may have a learning disability [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but then there are other children [SIGH] who don't have a learning disability [NOISE] who in fact may have a high IQ but [SIGH] their parents ... don't teach 'em respect, [SIGH] don't teach 'em discipline, [NOISE] and these things should be taught at a very, very early age.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  When a child first goes to school [SIGH] they should be taught to respect t- their [NOISE] parents number one, [SIGH] their teachers number two and [SIGH] any other grownup, a- ah, in that regard.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]  And I think that the t- -- the, ah, parents need to be held [SIGH] responsible also.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And that they need to attend [SIGH] -- when they are called to the school because of a disciplinary action they need to [SIGH] either come up there and help to ... keep that child in school and help to see that that child obeys the [SIGH] -- the law and the rules, or either they need to ... f- find themselves in court to find out, ah, what -- what they're doing to fall down on the job to not be able to keep those children in school [SIGH] and -- so that they can learn.
R:  That's true.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]  That's right --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- but -- but I -- I -- I read -- I read situations.  These are not the ... situations that happen all the time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're v- very rare situations but they happen.  [SIGH]  I read a situation where a teacher called [NOISE] up a parent --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] the parent came to school [SIGH] and the parent and the student beat the teacher up.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, dear [NOISE] that's terrible.
R:  And, ah, you know, that isn't right.  I mean, ah --
L:  N- no.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, that, ah, that teaches -- that teaches the child more violence.
L:  Absolutely and that's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a [SIGH] case for the police it s- [LAUGH] sounds like.  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  And --
L:  -- and yes and -- and children need -- all children need t- to feel safe [SIGH] when they go to school and I think sometimes children don't always feel safe.  I know that [SIGH] in some of the schools here where I live there are gangs, [SIGH] um, that operate right in the school and the children are so fearful, [SIGH] ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of the gangs.  And they're fearful for their own safety just to go to school and a child should never feel unsafe in their own school.
R:  That's right.  [NOISE]  A- a- a- and I believe that all stems -- it all stems --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from the fact that [SIGH] today, [SIGH] you know, they don't believe in corporal punishment in school.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And ... in other words the teacher cannot -- I don't say the teacher should beat a child up, [SIGH] but a teacher cannot, [SIGH] ah, exact any kind of a discipline from a child [SIGH] because the child today is not afraid of the teacher.  [SIGH]  All they'll tell the teacher is they'll tell their mother that they were hit, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] you know, it's not like years ago.  Years ago a child had respect for the teacher, [NOISE] they'd listen to the teacher --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] the teacher was allowed to give a little more discipline.  [SIGH]  Today everything is lax.  The teacher is not allowed to do this [SIGH] and the teacher is not allowed to do that.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  A- and this I think is -- is the cause of it.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I know years ago you never had guards in school.  [NOISE]  Ah, today you have to have guards in school.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Today you have to have teachers [SIGH] in the hallways watching the children, [SIGH] ah, to see that they go safe.  [SIGH]  If a child has to go to the bathroom in school they have to take [SIGH] another pupil from the same class.  [SIGH]  Two or sometimes three pupils have to go to the bathroom --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with the one child.  [SIGH] Years ago a child went to the bathroom, they went by themselves to the bathroom.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Why, because the teachers, their hands were not tied.  [NOISE]  Today their hands are tied on nearly everything that [SIGH] -- that would help them.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well I -- I do think safety's very, very important and ... whatever we have to do to get past this problem with the children not feeling safe in school, we need to do that, [SIGH] um, and on the buses and everything so that children, [SIGH] um, arrive safely.  [SIGH]
R:  That's right.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Uh-hum.
R:  That's right.  That's r- -- I agree -- I agree on that, ah, completely.
L:  And I -- I'm very sorry to say that, um, [SIGH] Head Start is in jeopardy because I think Head S- Start was such a good program -- is such a good program, to p- prepare these children for school [SIGH] so that they do s- succeed once they get there.  And, ah, if funds are cut to Head Start and they don't get, um, [SIGH] that education like you said when they start out at an early age learning these things and that -- and some -- and to some extent [SIGH] if they're not taught those things v- very, very young --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] it's a lot harder for them to catch on later.
R:  That's true.  That's true.  A- ah, [SIGH] Head Start and not only Head Start but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they used to have programs for, ah -- ah, children a- after school programs.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  In other words when the school -- when the school hour was finished [SIGH] they used to co- -- ah, stay in later on [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- have special clubs.  [SIGH]  They teach 'em art, sculpturing --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- [SIGH] a- ah -- ah, different things like that and a- a- a- and they became, ah, more, ah, +acclimatized to it.  You didn't have them roaming in the streets.  [SIGH]  You didn't -- you had less muggings --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and, ah, I think children were safer in those days.
L:  That's right and, um, -- I, um, -- I got the privilege of being principal for -- for a day [SIGH] at one of our elementary schools where I live ... this year and it was really a great experience [SIGH] for me.  And they said that they -- their plans are to use the school after hours more and to try to [SIGH] get the community involved in providing nice programs for the kids to attend.  [SIGH]  And not only that but other programs in the evenings for parents to participate in about parenting [SIGH] and preparing their children for school, [SIGH] and about health problems and, um, service -- family services that will [SIGH] keep the families supported enough so that they'll be supportive of th- -- of their children and that the children will succeed better in school.  [SIGH]  And I just thought that was a wonderful idea.  [SIGH]  And why not use these buildings that we're paying for anyway?  Why not use them [SIGH] all day in -- in to the evening and as you said, a- and even in the summer?
R:  That's right.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  That's true because the buildings are already there.  [SIGH]  They're already paid for.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, ah, why not utilize them?  [SIGH]
L:  It's a good idea.
R:  I -- I think it's an excellent idea but, ah, you know, [SIGH] ah, it's just a daydream I think.  I don't think half of these things will come ah, -- [SIGH] ah, will come to, ah, pass.  I really don't think so.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I think it's probably something that the community needs to care enough about to get involved in.  Maybe the churches, um, should say, -- you know, maybe the churches can help to run some of those programs in the evening so that it's n- not such an expense for the state or for the city.  [SIGH]  Ah, but, you know, take a responsibility form the neighborhoods and -- and just make it a better place for everyone to live.  [SIGH]  The schools used to be [MN] considered a -- kind of the heart of the community and a place where people knew it was safe to go and there would be wonderful programs there for their children.  [SIGH]  And now I don't know if people have that same feeling about it, but maybe we could get that feeling back if we [SIGH] really got involved.  Grandparents can help too and it doesn't have to be that w- -- that you have children of school age [SIGH] but grandparents can be ... good mentors for those little kids.
R:  That's true they can be [SIGH] and not only that but, ah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, they can be, ah, helpful ah, ah, and, a -- [SIGH] in -- in -- in that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] being a mentor to the younger children.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And their trying to --
L:  And to volunteer.
R:  -- different things from life experience.
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  I was really happy to see some of the new, um [SIGH]
