L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Oh, hello.
L:  Hi.  I -- I'm Michelle.
R:  Oh, this is Polly.
L:  Hi.  Are we --
R:  Hi, huh.
L:  -- the only two people here?
R:  Y- yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, okay, so the topic is, is there currently something wrong with the public school system?
R:  Yes.
L:  What do you think about that?
R:  Oh, I definitely think, "Yes".  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But I live in the south.  Where do you live?
L:  [SIGH] I live in Maryland so it's like the northeast.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, y'all --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all probably have better school systems than we do down here.
L:  [LAUGH] Not really.  It's, uh, in- inner city sort of schools.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, one problem would probably be violence, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- disrespect, um, [MN] I mean, the kids are just -- just getting worse and worse.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think the parents are involved enough though.
L:  Yeah, that's many of the problem.  The parents aren't as involved in the kids' lives.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's where they get it from.  [SIGH] Um, what --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- can be done about it?  [SIGH] That's a harder question.  What do you think about that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I mean, in the South, the public schools are absolutely awful.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they don't pay the teachers anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they get a lot of teachers that don't even have their degrees yet and they'll --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- hire them.  Because they j- -- there's just not enough teachers down here.  Nobody wants to teach --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- down here because they don't pay them anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, there's such a shortage --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that they have to -- they'll hire just about anybody.  You don't have to have your degree yet, you know?
L:  Wow.
R:  And so they'll hire you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so they get poor teachers which --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, and it just goes on and on.  I mean, so we have our kids in private school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean we really didn't have a choice.  The schools are really bad.
L:  Yeah, I think that's one thing about living in a city, you kinda -- you can kinda have a choice.  I mean, there are zoning requirements but you can -- you can, uh -- you can get around that.  'Cause I mean there's all -- there's the schools that you can -- you can choose.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But still all of them are kinda going downhill unless, you know, private schools, [NOISE] which I don't know too much of anything about.  But I know public schools, um, well, you have the gang problem, you have the violence problem, um, the kids them -- themselves just growing up too fast and they're all [NOISE] into -- into drugs and into drinking and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.
L:  -- um, things like that.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, the private schools are a lot stricter and the parents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- tend to be more involved because we're paying for it.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm like, "Well, kid --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- if I'm paying for this, you're gonna study, you're gonna mind your teacher" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so he's got a -- you know, he's got the uniforms he has to wear so there's no competition there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, to a certain -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it depends on the [MN] -- their -- some of them are religious, you know, affiliated.  Well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're all, uh, Christian based.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, he gets prayer.  He gets, you know, a little bit of -- it's very nondenominational and it's very minimal because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right now he's in the younger grades.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, y- there's not a lot of -- [NOISE] the g- older girls are not allowed to wear a bunch of makeup.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, their skirts have to cover their knees and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and, uh, they teach 'em respect, they teach 'em manners, they teach 'em all kinds of things that, you know, they nor- -- they wouldn't normally teach them in a public school.  I guess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they, you know -- they're -- they're overwhelmed with students too.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.
R:  And so, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one teacher, she can't possibly make time to teach all that in a public school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean I just think [MN] the schools are -- I -- well, we were in New York and the schools -- the public schools were excellent.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  But then they paid those teacher, you know, a g- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  They pay them really well and so there was a lot of competition and so they got to pick among the best teachers to hire for those schools, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, I mean, but they did not put any money in education in the south.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And parents are just like, "Well --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, "You handle him while he's at school".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, "We handle him while he's at home."
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "He's yours while he's at school".
L: Yes, 'cause the parents are not teaching their kids.  They're leaving [NOISE] that all up to the school system when really they, uh, ultimately have responsibility for their own children.
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  More teachers, more money --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's probably [LAUGH] ...  And I'm not sure what all the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what they can do about it.
L:  'Cause I -- I -- where I live in Maryland, it's -- it's close to the DC line so I don't know if you've heard anything about DC schools but they're infamous for being [SIGH] unruly.  Basically --
R:  Really?
L:  -- sort of inner -- inner city [NOISE] type school.  Um --
R:  Oh, 'cause we may have to move there in a few years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I -- when I went to sch- I didn't really go to a DC school though but it still [MN] meant Washington DC metropolitan area.  Mhm.  So, um, yeah, maybe I would think be stricter guidelines for the kids.  Um ...
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  You know, if [MN] [MN] teachers [NOISE] um -- even the parents once they get home, actually put their [NOISE] foot down with the children.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  And lay some ground rules, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  That'll be good.  Um, [PAUSE] well, the teachers should be more involved because, um, there were classes that I was in and the kids would be, you know, making fun o- of someone a- and being really horrible, and the teacher would actually join in.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, you had that.  I mean I had that going on.  [NOISE] The bullying.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  But then the teacher getting involved.  Not doing nothing to stop it but getting involved too.
R:  Well, they're probably --
L:  Which is really terrible.
R:  -- afraid of lawsuits.  I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's unreal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I think definitely something should be done about bullying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in schools.
L:  Definitely.
R:  I mean that's a big problem.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I don't know.  I'm not sure what the solution would be.  I'm sure there's lots of solutions but ...
L:  Yeah, but, uh, I think what you were saying was a good idea.  I mean, if you -- if you paid [NOISE] the teachers more, then you would have a broader selection from which to choose and therefore you would get higher quality candidates, by default, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they'll probably start there.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I would -- I -- I, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I keep waiting for them to do something down here, you know.
L:  Really?
R:  'Cause we're at the bottom when it comes to education.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when it comes to crime and teen pregnancies and dropouts, we're, you know, top of the list there.
L:  Really?
R:  But it never occurs to them to put money into it.  You know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know -- I don't know what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the problem is but they do not wanna put money into public education.
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...
L:  Actually that's the first time I would've put those two together but once you said it, y- you know, it makes a lot of sense.  But, you know, I never would have thought that that would be the issue.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, well, it -- it --
L:  But it does make sense though.
R:  Yeah, well, it is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- down here they can't get teachers that, you know -- who wants to teach?  You have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- unruly kids --
L:  Mhm, kids bringing guns --
R:  You know --
L:  -- to school.
R:  you're underpaid.  Nobody appreciates a teacher.  I mean, it's un- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- and I think they deserve --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot more respect than they get.  They're treated like --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- they're just babysitters.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Because, um, [NOISE] someone in my family used to [MN] teach but -- but they would never -- never go back to it because the situation in schools is so terrible with the violence and the guns and gangs or whatnot.  I'm on the phone.  Hello?
R:  Yeah, I'm still here.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, sorry.
R:  I am hiding in my garage from my kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so they said they -- they would never go back to it because th- the situation has such -- deteriorated in -- in the twenty years -- twenty four years they've been out of it because it's so bad.  Um, so, besides money, what else do you think?  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Definitely something about the security.  I mean, if you can't even feel safe t- you know, in your classroom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you're the adult there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know how they would manage security.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That would mean they -- they'll already putting up --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, the metal detectors and all.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] It's like coming into [SIGH] government building, I would imagine.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, you know, unless they had more -- you know, they cut the class size down and have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one teacher to every, you know, ten to fifteen kids, instead of twenty five to thirty kids, and she probably has, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, more control over a smaller amount of kids and more influence.  You know, the more adults --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there are watching them, you know, the least they're g- -- the less I would think they'd get away with.  You're more likely to notice, "Hey, this kid's not in class.  Where is he?"  You know?
L:  Mhm, yeah.  But then again you're back to the money issue.
R:  Money, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that'll be more teachers and more money.  Which probably [inaudible] mean more money in -- in the public school system.  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is just the one thing that they need to pump money into.  Because, uh, I mean, if you start -- if the kids start out bad then, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you've got more problems on down the road you're gonna have to deal with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, the crime, the pregnancy, the -- you know, everything else just -- it's like a domino effect to me.
L:  Mhm, yeah.
R:  So, you know, the earlier you start out giving 'em a good education and getting them involved and interested [NOISE] and on the right path.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, the less money you're gonna have to spend later on down the road on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- jails and everything else.  I mean, maybe not all of it, but certainly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's gotta have some kind of an impact.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, it's just, um -- maybe just getting the kids more involved in positive things.  They're not, you know, hanging out on the streets, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  -- getting involved with a whole bunch of negative things.  Yeah.
R:  Like after school activities.
L:  Yeah, that would help.  I would say that would help.
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  And they can -- they have somewhere to direct their energy.
R:  Yeah, I mean if the teachers were -- back to money.  If they were paid [LAUGH] more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and they weren't having to do extra curricular for free, I mean, they -- they might even be more willing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to volunteer, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to stay after school and have groups that get together and do certain things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or projects or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and kids don't have to go home to an empty house.  They can stay an hour or two, you know, actually doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something constructive at school.  [NOISE] But they would need supervision --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to do that.  Then, I mean, at least it would keep 'em off the streets and out of an empty house just, you know, watching TV or whatever it is, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Getting into trouble.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  So ...  
L:  But they're -- 
R:  How'd you hear about this project?
L:  [MN]
R:  Can I ask?
L:  Um --
R:  I keep waiting to --
L:  I was surfing, oh -- I was surfing the net one day.  I can't remember exactly how I came across, but I was surfing the net and I just signed up, you know, on the online form --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, okay.
L:  I do -- I do so much surfing I can't remember exactly.
R:  Oh, well, 'cause I resigned and cou- you know, use coupons all --
