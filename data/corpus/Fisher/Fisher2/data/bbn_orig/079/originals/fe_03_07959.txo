L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Hello, my name is Erica.  [SIGH]
R:  My name is Joe.  I live in Phoenix, Arizona.
L:  Oh, really?  This is New York City.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And ho- -- I am surprised to hear that the public system -- is the school system is bad over there too.  I thought it was only a New York phenomena.
R:  I bet you have a lot to say about that, don't you?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, you hear about it every single day.  Our mayor f- finally got control over the school system.  [SIGH]  He has more to say.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I don't know how much do you know about New York City?  H- he has to cut, ah, e- e- expenditure about -- on everything.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  That's true, ah, in Phoenix it's -- well, we don't get paid very well for the teachers here.  [MN]  But, um, there are a lot of dropouts and a lot of drugs in the school system now.
L:  You mean the teachers use drugs?
R:  No, the students.
L:  Oh, the students.  Oh.
R:  With the students.
L:  Oh!
R:  [SIGH]  And it's -- it's not good.  It's not like when I went to school.  [SIGH]  And I'm sure it -- it was better when you wen to school.  Things were easier and [SIGH] safer and, [SIGH] you know, my mother stayed home.  She didn't have to work.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And I went to school [SIGH] and my father worked.  [SIGH]  But t- today, you know, the kids are ... really -- they're very -- it's a different generation ... of people.  And they think nothing of, you know, not going to school.  Going late.  [SIGH]  Skipping classes.  [MN]  And I think it's the parents' responsibility to take care of the kids [SIGH] to make sure that they go to school.  [NOISE]  Don't you think so?
L:  Oh, absolutely.  Being late and skipping school is definitely the pa- -- that's something the parents should, ah, [SIGH] control.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, because we used to have [SIGH] -- what did they call those people that went after the children [SIGH] to make sure the went to school?
L:  Oh, I don't know.
R:  There was a name and I don't remember the name [SIGH] of -- of the people that did it.  But when I went to school [SIGH] if you didn't go to school, [SIGH] those people went to your parents and said, [SIGH] you know, "Your child did not go to school today.  Why?"  [SIGH]  And a lot of times the parents didn't even know it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, and so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these people of the law and the school would go to their house [SIGH] and check on them.  You know, the kids just skipped classes.  [SIGH]  But, a- ah, you know, it's different now because [SIGH] a lot of them are experimenting with drugs and, [SIGH] you know, they're having children while they're in high school.  [SIGH]  It's changed so much since I went to school.  [SIGH]  But, you know, people are willing to learn, they can learn, but [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, absolutely.  Yes.
R:  -- they'd rather just drop out.
L:  Yes, or our kids don't even appreciate [SIGH] education.  Don't know what it's good for.
R:  [SIGH]  The value.
L:  The value of it.  [SIGH]  And, also what I understand is that no matter how bad a kid does, [SIGH] the teacher is not allowed to fail them.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Because -- saying that if he doesn't learn in one year he's not going to learn in second year.  [SIGH]  And I don't believe that.  I used to have a classmate.  She wanted to drop out badly.  She refused to learn.  [SIGH]  And the parents said to her, "You have to learn.  You stay in school until you [LAUGH] pass the class".  [SIGH]  And, boy, she shaped up and she learned.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  The other thing that I [NOISE] h- hear from kids is, [SIGH] "Well, you know, when I graduate high school there won't be any jobs available.  Why should I go to college?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And I guess it is a concern for them because [SIGH] if they don't have a job how are they going to support their family, you know?  [SIGH]  It's really hard.  [NOISE]
L:  But without going to +college, without have a higher education, [SIGH] ah, they get even worse jobs with even less of an opportunity.
R:  That's correct.  [SIGH]  They need -- I --
L:  [SIGH]  They must realize that.
R:  -- yeah, I think they need to get more [NOISE] education now [SIGH] --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- to compete with the market, you know?  [SIGH]  It's --
L:  It's so complicated.  Everything on the [NOISE] computer, all the new software applied [SIGH] to your line of work.  It's very complicated, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- very hard.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, when I went to school I didn't even learn the computer.  I graduated in nineteen seventy two [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and I never even l- ... touched a computer till I got out of school, you know.  [SIGH]  So, it's -- it's -- it's really difficult for me to learn the computer system [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but those children learn it right away.  They're very, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, --
L:  In [LAUGH] Kindergarten they use it.  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  They learn right away.
L:  Or before.  [LAUGH]
R:  Or before, at home.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Watching their parents do it and things like that but, [SIGH] um, they -- they must learn the value of -- of education because [SIGH] they -- they won't go far in life without it I don't think.  [NOISE]  [MN]  It has to be part --
L:  Somebody has to explain it to them and, ah, who knows--
R:  True.
L:  -- why the parents don't do it?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, another thing is the cost.  You know, some parents don't have the money to send their children to college, [SIGH] because it gets more and more expensive now as the years go by.  [SIGH]  So, the children end up paying for it or they have to take out a loan, you know, they -- it's -- it's very difficult.  [MN]  Unless you get a scholarship or something like that [SIGH] it -- it's very difficult for both the family and the -- and the children.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, ...
L:  Yes, but, ah, [SIGH] anybody can take out a loan and then pay it off later if that's what --
R:  That's true --
L:  -- they want.
R:  -- they can do that.  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, state school, city, universities are still not that bad compared to [SIGH] -- like ivy league [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- classes.
R:  It's kind of hard for them, though, because they have a loan for their [SIGH] loan.  They buy a house; they have a mortgage loan.  I mean [SIGH] that's a lot of money to pay for a young person.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  It's a lot of stress and, [SIGH] ah, I don't know.  I ... I feel bad for them I really do.  [NOISE]  I wouldn't want to be young and start all over again.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, really?
R:  I really wouldn't want --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to do it all over again.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think --
R:  Would you?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think, y- yes, --
R:  I wouldn't want to do it again.
L:  -- I think I would.  On the other hand kids have so much more freedom, so much more, [SIGH] um, opportunities.  [SIGH]  Yes, I think I would.
R:  Oh, they do.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, especially for women, ah, more opportunities.
R:  Oh!
L:  Don't have to stay in the same few fields like before, just teacher and nurse and some thing.
R:  That's true.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  And they can go to different fields and try different things.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [SIGH] see where the market is [NOISE] going, you know -- place -- things like that.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But ...
L:  But I really would like [LAUGH] to be young a- again.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you would?  Well --
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yes.
R:  -- no, because life has changed so much.
L:  And how, yes.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  It's changed so much for those people.  [SIGH]  And now with social security, [SIGH] you know, I'm wondering if it's going to be there when I retire.  And --
L:  [SIGH]  That's something I never worry about because they will not let that go.  They cannot possibly let our sixty five years old people [SIGH] -- the entire p- -- in the entire country just to -- to toss out on the street.  [SIGH]
R:  But see now for people that are younger than us, [SIGH] they retire at sixty six, sixty seven --
L:  [SIGH]  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] sixty eight.  I mean they have to work longer in their life.  [SIGH]
L:  Well.
R:  You know, and I -- I'm ready to retire now, you [LAUGH] know it's like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] that's it I don't want to go --
L:  What kind of a job do you do that you are [LAUGH] so, ah --
R:  Y- yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  O- oh!
R:  Yeah, it's --I think the young people have it really hard.  I really do.  [SIGH]  You know, we -- we're half -- I'm half way through my retirement, you know, [SIGH] towards my retirement [SIGH] and to think I'd have to start all over again and do another twenty years.  Oh, my God!  [SIGH]  Oh, that would be awful.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy my youth.  I did.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But still when I was doing it, [SIGH] it was easier to get a job.  It was easier to get [SIGH] m- money because the -- the -- the cost wasn't as much [NOISE] as it is now.  [SIGH]  It's not as competitive, you know?  [SIGH]  It's different.  But I -- I believe --
L:  Well, the job situation that it's so bad now, it's temporary.  It's just a downturn in the economy.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, [SIGH] of course, this crazy terrorist is ...  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, [NOISE] that's got a lot to do with it.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it has.
R:  A lot to do with it.  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, and --
R:  Has New York recovered yet?
L:  Not completely.  Ah, it's very hard to judge.  Seemingly, on the surface everything is all right, but they keep saying the job situation is also -- [SIGH] and ever since this mayor is trying to fix the budget.  [SIGH]  Everything is going up.  Everything.
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  Property tax, taxes.  [SIGH]  Just for a very short while, maybe a year or two, Giuliani, the former mayor, [SIGH] stopped the, ah, s- sales tax.  It -- it's back again.
R:  Yeah.  It's the same here.  Our budget is in a [SIGH] really bad deficit.  A lot of states are doing the same thing, [SIGH] you know, and they're cutting education as well.  I know because --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I hear it here all the time.  [SIGH]  Programs are being cut.  [SIGH]  You know, things that aren't, like, electives and things like that.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Art, gym, [SIGH] things that are not ... important, that they don't need.  [SIGH]  But it's -- it's -- it's awful, it really is, really bad the budget.  [SIGH]  And I think it's going to be for a while yet.  That we're going to have to [NOISE] -- to d- deal with that, you know?
L:  But, you know, we can't really know because one day the stock market is up and you hear, "Yeah, the downturn is over".  [SIGH]  The next day it's down "Oh, well, it's the bear market".  [LAUGH]  Nobody really knows.  [SIGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  Nobody knows.  [SIGH]  Hopefully it's over.  [SIGH]  Of course downtown New York and on the World Trade Center site [SIGH] those are offices are m- more -- many of them [SIGH] are not rented yet.  [SIGH]  And what really surprise me.  I walked around what's left September and [SIGH] in buildings where I used to work, where there used to be an o- o- -- a office building --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- they are renting them as apartments.  On a Saturday afternoon they were moving in furniture.
R:  Wow!
L:  Ah, that is the office building [LAUGH] where I worked.
R:  Well, you see because they have to rebuild and that takes money.  Ah, you know, it comes back to money again, you know?  [SIGH]  People need money to rebuild their company or whatever they lost, you know?  [SIGH]  It takes a lot --
L:  The buildings themselves are gigantic big buildings.
R:  Yeah, --
L:  It's unbelievable --
R:  -- that's true.
L:  -- amount of money.  [SIGH]  And do you know they want to build a higher building than the -- this was once?
R:  O- oh, [LAUGH] is that right?  [LAUGH]
L:  A build -- it should be the tallest building in the world.
R:  In the world?
L:  I mean how many times do they want to -- them to come in and -- and, um, put --
