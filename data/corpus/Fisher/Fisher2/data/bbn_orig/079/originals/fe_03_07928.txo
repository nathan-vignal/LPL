L:  Hello?
R:  [MN] Hello?
L:  Yes, um, I'm Lyn Petsald[?].
R:  P- --
L:  I'm from Wisconsin.
R:  Hi, Lyn.  I'm Maureen Marron[?] and I'm from New York City.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine.
R:  Subject --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- is public schools?
L:  Correct.
R:  And is there something I for- -- you know, I don't remember exactly what the question was.
L:  Uh, do -- I -- what I remember i- -- I guess I was so shocked to get this phone call.
R:  Me too.
L:  Um, I think, do we think they're doing their job or are they good?
R:  [MN] Are they doing a good job or is there something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really, really wrong with what's going on in public schools.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I know our schools here are good.  Um, taxes, of course, are very high to support the schools --
R:  Where --
L:  -- but --
R:  -- in Wisconsin are you?
L:  Wisconsin Rapids.
R:  Erm, my brother lives in Hartford, Wisconsin, which I think, is like a mile out of Milwaukee.
L:  Okay, yeah, we're about three hours from there.
R:  North?
L:  Y- uh, yes, uh-huh.
R:  Oh, so you're at -- y- are you in the upper peninsula?
L:  No, but, uh, we're -- we're north of Hartford --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but, ah, we're not way up north, no.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
L:  But --
R:  That's really great that -- that the public school system is -- is good where you are.  Do you --
L:  This is a small --
R:  -- have kids there?
L:  It's a small town so I think, you know, there's a lot of support here for the schools and the only thing I don't like about it, I think the teachers are overpaid, which probably is not --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, well I mean they, um -- you figure they work nine months out of the year and I mean most of them are making like thirty, forty thousand dollars.
R:  So, at least --
L:  -- for not --
R:  -- like if -- if you to [inaudible] -- because they only work nine months out of the year, you would annualize that number and it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- would be -- would be higher.
L:  Yeah.  I mean if they worked tw- --
R:  That's a good point.
L:  If they worked twelve months, then okay, but you figure they get a week off for spring break and your Christmas vacation a week.
R:  Right.
L:  And then they get -- I mean --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I don't know how old you are but I mean when I went to school the teachers had to go to meetings after school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- off.
R:  I'm thirty nine.
L:  Oh, yeah, okay, you're younger.  I'm sixty.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I mean the teachers had to do all this --
R:  It was more of a --
L:  -- during their, you know --
R:  -- full time job.
L:  -- on their own time and not -- and say part -- if they coach sports they get paid for that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, like I say, years ago I think the teachers were underpaid.  Now, it's just seems like their always wanting more and more benefits, more time off.  I mean if they have -- have to stay after school they get paid for every minute that they, you know, stay after.
R:  Right.
L:  And I know the grade schools they have two days off a month just so they can attend meetings and stuff --
R:  Well like planning days?
L:  -- the kids have off of school.  Yeah.  And --
R:  And --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- that's during the regular week?  Mondays through Friday?
L:  Correct, yeah.
R:  Wow, I -- I went to -- I went to public schools, um -- actually I went to a private school for one year and when I was in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sixth grade I think.  But, um, I went to public schools and I went to high school in southeastern Connecticut.  It's a town called Montville, which now has one of those Indian casinos in it so it has a lot of notoriety.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, I had a great education in my public high school.  I -- I'm not really sure exactly what the teachers were getting paid --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But there were some good teachers and some bad teachers.  I mean, just like you find anywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, there were some, uh, uh, teachers that had a huge impact on me and, um, [MN] would allow me to make choices later on in life that I certainly wouldn't have had, had I not gone to that particular school.
L:  Y- well, I think too when I was in grade school, I mean, like I was just so -- I mean, you knew the teachers and they knew it.  'Cause I came from a big family.  They knew --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my sisters and stuff and but I -- I w- -- I used to work in the school system as an aide so I kinda knew what was going on.  I mean, this is just within the last --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ten years.
R:  Oh, so you did that after your children got out of school?
L:  Yeah, well they're in school.  Uh, my youngest was, uh, in junior high but, um, I worked in -- for like ten years in a grade school then I moved up to a high school.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But, um, like I say there's -- and there I kinda got, uh, to see kinda behind the scenes what, you know -- like what the teachers were doing in the lounge and to all their talking and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  Some I respected and some I definitely did not.
R:  You --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- definitely got a behind the scenes kind of look though?
L:  Yeah.  I mean and there are some -- I mean, if I'd be walking the halls and stuff, I mean there's some classes I wish I could just go in there and sit and listen because they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- were so interesting.
R:  Right.
L:  And some had control of the classes and some absolutely had no control of what was going on and, um, I ju- like I say, I think ours are very g- -- I mean, compu- -- these kids are learning so much on the computers and stuff.
R:  It's amazing.  They're just amazing.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  I don't --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
L:  No, that's okay.  
R:  Ah [SIGH] so the basic topic is, is there something really, really wrong with the public school system?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- a- and [MN] I think -- I'm a really big, uh, free market economist kind of person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think that if there were vouchers available where parents were able to direct their kids to go to the school that was the best in the area as opposed to the one that just happened to be geographically --
L:  In their neighborhood, yeah.
R:  -- most convenient.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Milwaukee has that.
R:  It would have -- it would definitely have an effect.
L:  Milwaukee has that.
R:  It does?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  W- and the -- the curriculum and everything is still decided on a local level like a local Milwaukee school board, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, there's direct participation from people right there at the grass roots level?
L:  Yeah.  I'm not sure how the vouchers -- I've kind -- you know, 'cause I've read stuff in the newspaper and stuff like that.
R:  Well, do they have catholic schools there too as well as public schools?
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And [several inaudible words] kids are able to go to the parochial schools.
R:  Right.  Well, I know that --
L:  Yeh.
R:  -- um, my older brothers and my older sister did go to parochial school in the New York City school system.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they definitely had, um -- I mean, uh, well I've never heard anybody complain about that education except for the fact that maybe the nuns were all mean but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I -- 
L:  I know my best friend in, ah -- when I was growing up she went to a catholic school and, you know, I'd go sometimes with her if she had to go back for something and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- she'd say, "Oh, that's one mean" or "This one's nice" and I could kinda get a sense of who was really nice but --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you didn't get that at --
R:  Did -- were your parents involved in your education?
L:  [MN] My -- my dad was working three day -- jobs a day -- uh, three jobs.  So, I mean, he was just going from one job to another.
R:  Right.
L:  My mother did what she -- but yes, she was, er, now I think of it.  She was, I remember, a president of the PTA.
R:  Wow, that's involved.
L:  Yeah, and, um, she'd always have the teachers over for lunch once in a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- you don't talk -- I guess this really makes me go back in years because I mean nowadays you wouldn't think of doing that.
R:  No, probably not.  I mean I -- I know a lot of mothers probably are working a job because --
L:  Well, exactly.
R:  -- they can't afford to be in a -- a -- a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a one income house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Like I say, my dad was working three jobs where you know --
R:  Yeah, there you go.  
L:  And --
R:  So, you had a -- one parent working three jobs so ...
L:  But then my -- you know, he wasn't around much either.
R:  Right, that's true.
L:  But -- but [MN] are you in New York City did you say?
R:  Yeah, I live in Manhattan.
L:  Oh, boy, that's a neat area, isn't it?
R:  I'm really lucky.  I'm really lucky.  I live in this great, um, [SIGH] uh, part- group of apartments called Styberson[?] Town and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's -- they were built by, um, metropolitan life insurance company right after World War Two --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so that the returning GIs would have, um, good housing.
L:  Oh, now do you --
R:  Or -- or decent housing.  Um ...
L:  Is your husband a service man or ...?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Is your husband in the service?
R:  No, my husband --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, [MN] [MN] uh, went to Boston College, uh, Jesuits.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, um, h- when I met him I think he was on the waiting list here.  There was a waiting list --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to get an apartment because they didn't turn over a whole lot and they actually the rents were fairly cheap.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But there's so many kids here and it looks like [MN] -- well, I'm not sure.  I mean, it seems like a lot of them go to the parochial school, which is right up the street.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But there are also public schools in my area that, um, have been doing really, really well.  
L:  Do they have -- 
R:  There's one in --
L:  Do they have a lot of computers there?
R:  Um, I honestly don't know what kind of equipment they have inside, let's say, the parochial --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- school versus the public school and I'm sure they could always use more equipment but --
L:  I -- I'm just --
R:  I think most houses have a computer so the kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- will have an opportunity ...
L:  Yeah, I'm just guessing, um, the parochial schools here I -- from what I hear don't have as many as the public schools.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And that's why I'm thinking -- that's why I think the public schools are doing really good because I mean that's the way of the world is the computers.
R: Right, absolutely.
L:  And I -- it's almost like they want one for almost each kid to have one in the class.
R:  I know.  [SIGH] And now -- now they make 'em so you don't have to plug 'em in.  You can just walk around with them.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Those they don't -- these are all, I am sure, are plug ins but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, no, I think that's one thing you're deprived of if y- not deprived but I mean if you go to, uh, parochial schools, I don't know if they can afford that many.
R:  That's true.  That's true.  I worked for --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- a company that, um -- there's a -- a organization called the Boys Club of New York and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so the president of our company would take our computers and donate it to the Boys Club of New York so that they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- would have access to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you know, it's not just the government that p- can provide resources and stuff.  There are private --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- organizations that can do that as well.
L:  Yeah, which that is nice.
R:  Yeah, I -- you know what?  I think I've -- slowly coming to the conclusion that, yeah, there's something m- --
