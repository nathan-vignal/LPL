L:  Hi, this is Lisa.
R:  Hi Lisa, this is Marisa.
L:  Hi Melissa.
R:  How are you?
L:  Good thanks -- how are you?
R:  Good.  This is the first time I've done this -- I'm not really sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Me too, actually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, good.
L:  [MN] Where are you at?
R:  I'm in Kansas City -- where are you?
L:  Oh, I'm in [inaudible] Illinois which is right in the middle of -- of Illinois.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  Did you have nice weather there today, too?
L:  We did, thankfully.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, it's been really hot lately, but, it's started to cool off, so ...
R:  Well, good.
L:  Yeah, now, we're supposed to talk about a million dollars [LIPSMACK] -- would we --
R:  And, never speak to your best friend again.
L:  Yes, yes, what do you think?
R:  I would do it in a heartbeat.
L:  You would do it?
R:  Yes, I would.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, you would.  [LAUGH] How long have you been best friends with your best friend?
R:  We've been best friends for eighteen years probably.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But, I have three kids.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I'm thinking, a million dollars would pay for their college education --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- and my friend would understand --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- if given the opportunity to tell her that.
L:  Yeah, which would be an important thing, too.
R:  Right.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, well, actually I probably wouldn't take it at this point, um --
R:  [several inaudible words] that's very good of you.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I [MN] -- you know, it -- unless I was actually put in that situation, I'm not really sure, but, it feel like right now I wouldn't, you know, but we -- I've been married for two years, and we don't have children yet, and um, you know [MN] -- I have a friend that I've been friends with since -- [SIGH] since junior high, and just -- she's very important to me, so, I don't know.  I guess [several inaudible words] --
R:  Well, I understand that, too, but -- I --I -- maybe it's just because I have kids --
L:  Yes, absolutely, that --
R:  -- and, I think if --
L:  -- changes the whole --
R:  -- I could say to her, "Shelly, I could never speak to you again, but, my children would --"
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  "-- be taken care of".
L:  Forever, and then their children would be taken care of, too, yeah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- absolutely.
R:  I think she'd understand.
L:  I think your whole life probably has to change once you have the first kid, and, then when you have two more, I can't even imagine it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, gosh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's -- it's crazy.
L:  Yeah, how old are your kids?
R:  Um, I have a ten year old, and then I have a two year old, and I have a one year old.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're a busy lady, huh?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, they keep me pretty busy.
L:  Definitely.  Do you stay --
R:  So, um --
L:  -- at home with them, or ...?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Do you stay home with them?
R:  I do now --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- I sure do.
L:  Good.
R:  When I had the third one it just became rather difficult to work, so ...
L:  Absolutely. Wow.
R:  Um, and then -- what do you do?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, actually I have gone back to school for my, um, for my masters.  I was a high school math teacher, and, um --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- yeah, and it was definitely a good challenge, but, um, don't get -- you don't get paid too much unless you've got your masters.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, speaking of money there [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there you go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how do you like teaching high school?
L:  Um, it was fun, it was, um, like I said, definitely an adventure, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I had the opportunity to teach at the college level though once I started back at my masters, and, ah, I liked it a lot better, actually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You didn't have hall duty, you didn't have to call parents, you didn't have any of that -- [SIGH] that way, so, ah -- so, it was definitely more fun -- [SIGH] the kids weren't quite as, um, I don't know, quite as easy to get to know and things at the college level, because they just come in for their classes and leave.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, but, much easier to -- to manage as far as [SIGH] [inaudible] --
R:  You're not nearly as responsible for them.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Or, as accountable for how they do.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  [MN] Which has gotta be kinda nice.
L:  Yes, most definitely.  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I'm sure in high school, if they do bad, you're like, "Where did I fail?" --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- "What did I do wrong?".
L:  Yes, and at --
R:  That kind of thing.
L:  And, at the college level if they all do well, then they ask what you did wrong, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Well, that's --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- very exciting --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- what -- what college were you teaching at?
L:  Ah, Illinois State.
R:  Wow.
L:  Illinois State University.
R:  You sound very young, too.
L:  Oh, I am fairly young -- I'm mid twenties, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  That's wonderful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's quite impressive.
L:  Oh, it's -- it was fun -- my husband actually works at -- at ISU as well, so, we got to car- -- we get to carpool, so -- what did you do before you stayed home with the two younger ones?
R:  Oh, well, I'm a therapist, I -- I'm licensed to do counselling.
L:  That's why you're such a good listener -- you're asking all the good questions.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think you're -- you're pretty good at that, too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You have [several inaudible words] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, yeah, um, I missed it a lot, but, it -- it's so wonderful to be here with my kids, too.
L:  Absolutely, and pretty soon that older one's gonna be a teenager and you're gonna be doing enough -- [LAUGH] enough counselling [SIGH] [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, believe me, that is happening so quickly.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I mean, it just seems like yesterday he was two, and, you know, suddenly this sweet boy that I had is kind of becoming defiant --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm like, "Who are you?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "And, where did you put my child?".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  "Go away!".  [LAUGH]
L:  And, it just gets worse.  [MN] 
R:  Yeah, it does, well -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  It gets better at the same time.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, he's -- as a teacher you probably can relate, or understand this -- he's actually gifted [COUGH] and on our gifted program here which is really, really hard to get into, and those children are just -- gosh, I hate to use the word different -- I hate to stereotype 'em, but, they're just very different and present a whole 'nother set of challenges.
L:  Absolutely, they have -- I mean, that's -- that's the reason why they have a whole set of classes for, ah -- for teachers to learn how to teach gifted kids, but, then they also have a whole set of books and guidance for parents, because there's a -- a whole different crew to parent even.
R:  I'll tell you what -- when he got into the -- into the gifted program and I met some of the other children, it was such a relief to me.  I'm like, "Oh, thank god, that I didn't do anything wrong" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because he's so -- he's so different, he's so, um -- [MN] if you didn't know him you would never think that he was intelligent, because he doesn't remember what he's doing from one minute to the next --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and then when I see these other children that are exactly the same way --
L:  Yeah, it's a relief, huh?
R:  -- and to have the teacher tell me, "Oh, this is so common", I'm like, " [MN] Okay, I didn't do anything wrong".  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what kind of subjects does he favor?
R:  All of them.
L:  Really?
R:  All of them, um, that's what's --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- [MN] that's what they told me is the difference between a really bright kid and a gifted kid -- is that the really bright kid may have one or two areas that they're very strong in --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and a gifted child -- it's everything -- 
L:  Wow --
R:  -- I mean --
L:  -- that's a good definition. 
R:  -- it's everything -- now, he likes to design, um, buildings, machines, um, blueprints, floor plans -- you name it, he has that design thing that he likes to do, but, his math and science are phenomenal, and -- you know, he was one of those early readers, like, he was reading at three --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- but, I thought they all did.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You didn't know he [several inaudible words], huh?
R:  And people would say their kids weren't reading -- I'm like, "What?".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  [LAUGH] No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just thought everybody's kids were reading, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, then he's always had that vocabulary -- but, I was young when he was born -- I was twenty two, and I honestly -- I just really thought all the kids were like that. 
L:  Wow.
R:  And, I -- I remember, like, being at the grocery store, and people would just look at me and say, "He's really bright, isn't he?", and I'd be like, "I -- I guess".  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I think so.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think he is [LAUGH] --
L:  But, I am his mother, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, it just never -- it just never occurred to me that he was really different from anybody else.
L:  Wow.
R:  Unt- until I had more children, and then I'd take 'em to the pediatrician, I'm like, "What is wrong with -- with her?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  [LAUGH] Nothing's wrong.
R:  It's like nothing -- [LAUGH] yeah, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely, wow, that's gotta be a whole different experience, then, too -- [inaudible] --
R:  [MN] It is -- I remember at her sec- -- my daughter will be three tomorrow, but --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- on her second birthday I took her to our pediatrician, and, you know, she was saying -- not -- and she wouldn't speak in, like, sentences yet, and I was very concerned, because my son at two could speak like you and I do, right now --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, I'm like, I mean, I seriously -- I was distraught, I'm like, "Something is wrong --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- she doesn't talk, like she's supposed to talk -- her language development is way off", and he's, like, "No, no, no, Marisa -- she's normal --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- she's actually above average".  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  And, I know when my son went for -- I think when he was four is when I kinda got a clue -- we went to our pediatrician [SIGH] and he told our pediatrician how the circular [inaudible] work.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  And, my doctor's like, "What?".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Did you teach him that?".  I'm like, "No -- I don't know what he's talking about", [LAUGH] you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, wow.
R:  [LAUGH] That was when, I'm like, "Oh, [inaudible]" -- so, I don't know, I'm sure you have had children like that though in your classes, right?
L:  Some, yeah, but, not quite to that extent -- course by the time that they're -- by the time they're in high school they're denying it one way or another, you know [inaudible] --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- um, even --
R:  That's why these programs are so nice, 'cause then they get with other children that are like them.
L:  Absolutely, and I taught at a rural school that didn't really have that opportunity at the younger level, nor the higher level, so ...
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  Yeah, they had just implemented, um, the advanced -- the AP courses, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the high school, just a year before I started teaching a couple of years ago, so --
R:  So, you're, um -- your school district then didn't require, like, IEPs on gifted children?
L:  Um, they do have IEPs for, um -- they -- they treat it more for special ed students --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, they just don't [SIGH] -- I don't know how exactly to explain it, but, they don't identify very well at the beginning, um, whether students are gifted or whether they're special ed, you know, they don't -- don't take the time to look and see what the -- what the differences are there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause some kids are gifted children that are just bored out of their minds, and --
R:  Oh, it's -- it's --
L:  -- and it's ...
