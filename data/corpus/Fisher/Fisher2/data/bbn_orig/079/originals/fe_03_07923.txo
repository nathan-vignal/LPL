L:  Hi, my name is Marie.
R:  Hi, and I'm Mary.  [LIPSMACK] I'm from Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, I'm New York.
R:  Oh, hi.  I was born in Manhattan.
L:  Oh, very good.
R:  I went to P.S. Forty.
L:  Oh, I don't know where -- oh, I know more or less where there is [NOISE] but ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I went -- I was born in Brooklyn.  [NOISE] My kids, uh, [NOISE] uh, i- in Queens now and th- there is definitely wrong with pubs- things wrong with public schools.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- moved a lot in my life and I just see different school districts --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- advantages and disadvantages.  You know, so kids -- some kids get exposed to a lot and other kids don't get those chances.
L:  R- right, right.  But I feel, um, [NOISE] that they [NOISE] should go back to the old fashioned way, when I was growing up, where they had general diplomas, academic or commercial.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yes.
L:  Because of the fact that you have a lot of children now that attention deficit, have learning disabilities [LIPSMACK] and I feel that, um, w- [MN] if a child can't read, how can they learn a language?
R:  How can they learn anything else?
L:  Yep.
R:  If they don't have basic things.
L:  Right.  So, I mean like I have a son.  He has a learning disability.  I mean, he can read.  But they give him chemistry, they give him Spanish.  He ended up dropping out because -- why do you do that to children?  Why?
R:  And kids don't really know what their choices are.
L:  Right.  Now if would have had a general, like they did when we was younger [NOISE] --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- where you had your basic math.  You learn math, you learn basic science, you know what I'm saying?  The smarter children had the regents --
R:  Yes.
L:  Which --
R:  Well, that's in New York.  That's not everywhere.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  But, yeah, that was not a bad thing.
L:  And then, or commercial.  You learn a- a trade.
R:  Yes, you have business background and you could tell by the diploma where w- you know, what they knew.
L:  Right.
R:  Where their -- you know, and -- and that's not like they were experts but they had a little bit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on -- on the ball already.
L:  But at least you taught them something.  This way you're not teaching them anything.
R:  Now here -- well, no, not if you lose 'em.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  
R:  Now here they have a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Vo-Tech schools.  They can go to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- vocational schools --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- instead of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the traditional high schools.
L:  Right.
R:  Do you have that?
L:  Wh- -- yeah, we do have, uh, aviation.  Yeah, yeah, certain ones but you have to -- you have to try to get into them.  It's not like [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  Like here you can't pick and choose, "Well, I wanna go to this school and you go".
R:  Oh, here they can graduate from high school and practically have their beauty licence to b- to be a beautician.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  They used to have that years ago but I don't know if they have that any more
R:  Oh, we still have that too.  Because I just think it's good for them to -- not every kid is going to go to College.   They're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not gonna have academics or college prep as they would have called it but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, they need to have something.  Because with --
L:  Right. 
R:  -- just a high --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- school education or with none, uh, they can't earn a decent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- living.
L:  That's right.  But you can't [NOISE] give a child who has a learning disability, the same subjects as a child who is a ninety five average.
R:  No, no, and --
L:  And --
R:  -- those learning disability children, sometimes they have a knack for something else.
L:  Right.
R:  I think they have to work a little harder to find out if that's --
L:  My son --
R:  -- true.
L:  -- is a hands on.  He can paint --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- like, [NOISE] I mean, yeah, ev- -- he's been hired to paint all my friend's houses because he knows how to do it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's something that he likes to do but he has no high school diploma.
R:  So, he could have maybe --
L: [NOISE]
R:  -- learned carpentry --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or --
L:  [NOISE] Yes.
R:  -- even more things about house, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- things handyman type things.  And --
L:  And what they should do is go back to the old [NOISE] way.
R:  Well, that's not a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bad idea probably.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The real old way was that every, [MN] you know, local area -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- managed their own school district.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The federal government didn't get involved.
L:  Right.
R:  The state government didn't get involved but in your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- local community you set what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have in your schools.
L:  I mean, because like I said, my daughter now [NOISE] graduated from eighth grade.  Now she has to go to high school.  Now, she could apply for a high school far away but there's a possibility that she wouldn't get into it.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I'm saying.  It's not like, well, unless you wanted something that your school is not offering --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like beach channels, say o- oceanography.  Your school -- but there's still no guarantee that there's room for your child.
R:  Yeah.  How would she get there?
L:  [NOISE] She would have to take buses.  So, now h- my local high school [MN] is good as [NOISE] long as she's going to go for, uh, you know, like where she's gonna go to college because they only have regent.  You have to pay us these, uh -- these regents.
R:  And, um, are -- what are the regents?  Are they -- do they take them before they graduate.
L:  [NOISE] Yes, everything has to be taken before.  If you don't pay us, you can't graduate.  Because you have to have an English regent, a math regent, a [NOISE] science regent, a history regent, you have to have all them --
R:  More states --
L:  -- if you don't pass.
R:  -- are doing that now.  Where they just -- they can't get their diploma unless they pass [MN] a -- a test.  
L:  I could see a competency test.
R:  Yes.
L:  But that is for resource room.
R:  'Cause you know --
L:  They don't --
R:  -- they still give people GEDs
L:  Yeah, GED is if you quit school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then you go to [NOISE] night school.  Quite a lot of jobs in New York don't want a GED.  
R:  No, they want the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- high school.  'Cause they know they have to do more to get it I guess.
L:  But the point is h- if a child is not [NOISE] in resource room --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like my daughter, you j- you know, I'll just use her as a -- she's not a resource room so now she goes to high school so she can't pass the regent.  Years ago, if you -- say you failed one regent, th- you were sm- they knew you were bright from your marks --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they would give you just a normal diploma.  You wouldn't have a regents diploma.
R:  Oh.
L:  N- now here, if you don't pay us, you don't get it but you can't graduate either. Unless you're in resource room.  Then you can pass a competency test.
R:  So, do you feel that they don't pay enough attention to the individual kid?
L:  Yes, yes.  They work on the smarter children and the -- the -- the weaker ones get passed through.
R:  Or if they have a weakness in the traditional way.
L:  Right, right.
R:  They may have -- like I say, I think your son probab- -- well, he does.  He has a lot of talent in other areas.  
L:  Right.
R:  But they don't develop that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they ignore that.
L:  No, no, not in [NOISE] New York.
R:  Oh, that's too bad.
L:  I mean --
R:  So, then they lose a lot of people.
L:  Oh yes, definitely.  Definitely lose a lot of people.  You know, I mean, you get [NOISE] -- you look and then some [NOISE] kids.  Like my [MN] son's, uh [NOISE] -- my g- --
R:  You have a little one?
L:  Uh, well, I babysit.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  My son's friend, because he was in school all in time and he sat there, they passed him through.  And he can't -- yeah, he graduated but he can't hold a job.  He has no talent in anything.
R:  And he still doesn't know anything but he got through.
L:  Yes, because he was good.  He behaved.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, what I'm saying.  So, I mean is that a waste -- 
R:  They don't do those kids any favors either.
L:  No, not at all.  Not at all.  And I feel they should let a mother, you know, or a woman really -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- run the education.  They have men and I haven't seen a man do anything right yet.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I know, it's odd that men get these jobs that, um, [LIPSMACK] really women know better.  
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, women have a better sense -- a natural sense to it because, erm, uh, you just know kids better.  I mean there's no question about that.
L:  Now, in Pennsylvania.  How do they work the schools?
R:  Well, every school system is different.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You could drive a mile in any direction and the kid has a completely different education.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, um, now I used to [MN] -- for six years I was out near Pittsburgh and they were very, uh, depressed because their steel mills collapsed, you know, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they had no money and the school systems were terrible and they were actually permitted to kick sk- kids out of school.  Now, years ago you couldn't get kicked out of school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- until you were at least sixteen.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, today they can kick out young kids --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- because they have --
L:  If they're not --
R:  -- yeah, they have welfare moms, who they -- they don't make their kids go to school.  They're on drugs and stuff like that --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and they don't care if their kids go to school or th- -- it's not like they don't really care. 
L:  Right.
R:  It's that they're not even able.
L:  They're too busy [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing their thing.
R:  And then they were going to penalize them and -- and, uh, take welfare dollars away from them if their kids didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go to school.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, then there was an --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uprising about that -- that -- but, you know, if you're home all day well the -- you should help your kid get to school, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But, um, anyway so that is really bad --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there and then the problem is sometimes you have a wealthier town next to a really poor town --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and those kids have to go to school together.  And that's really hard on those kids.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  You know.  Now, out here where I am now, is on the eastern part of the state, about forty miles out of Philly and the town I used to work in, why, my goodness, they had a school district you couldn't believe.  These kids had all kinds of advantages and they had, uh -- like in that town the problem was if a kid was average, they felt like misplaced in the school.  
L:  [NOISE] Ah.
R:  You know, if they just were, say, C. students, they were not accepted because most of their parents are scientists and authors --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and you know, and like that.  And so these kids if they were just normal, average children they were lost --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- in the system.  And it was -- it's really sad.  But the school districts there are no -- across Pennsylvania there's no standard like you have the regents.  We don't have anything like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  And again though the -- the weaker kids are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lost.  Are absolutely lost.
L:  Right, [NOISE] right.
R:  And they're more lost now than ever.
L:  I know and it's a sin.  [NOISE] It really is.  [NOISE] Because these are the chil- -- the people who are going to run our -- our government.
R:  Absolutely.  And the -- the gap is getting bigger between the kids who don't have and the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kids who do.  You know.  And even -- it- it's not even always just money but th- they can get lost even if they come from families with money.  Um, [MN] they can get lost in so many ways.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  You know?
L:  Oh, yeah, even [NOISE] because I don't know if you [NOISE] know the Internet, uh what happened [NOISE] with the hazing?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, my, yes.
L:  Those were all rich -- rich children.
R:  Yes.
L:  Come from beautiful neighborhoods.  [NOISE]
R:  Yes, and they st- --
