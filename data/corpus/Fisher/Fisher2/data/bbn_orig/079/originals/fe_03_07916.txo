L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [COUGH] My name is Paula.
R:  I'm Jamie.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  Where are you located?
L:  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm here in M- Minneapolis.
L:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is it -- is it warm or cold?
R:  It's, um -- it's been really warm.  It's been in the eighties but, uh, today, we just had like this big rainstorm and now it's like back in the sixties.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.  Well, we hit a hundred today.
R:  Ouch.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really bad.
R:  [MN]
L:  Everyone's like freaking out.  Uh, it's -- the weather's like a huge issue out here. [SIGH]
R:  Is it pretty smoggy too?
L:  It's always like that, yeah.
R:  Ick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, totally.  So, let's see.
R:  It's certainly get that here too.  Like the smog.  I think they're starting to even, you know -- don't they do ratings or something on different days down there?
L:  Yeah, they do a smog alert.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like --
R:  They've -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they've started to do that here, I think, too now.
L:  Oh, that's too bad.  It just --
R:  I know.
L:  -- seems like the pollution's spreading.
R:  I know it's terrible.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I did my part.  I moved closer to work.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  Like --
L:  -- good.
R:  -- to me, it's only about ten minutes now.  It used to be half an hour.
L:  Oh, that must be nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Most people I know like --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  -- are on the freeway, it's like two hours every day.
R:  Oh.  Well, yeah, no wonder the smog's bad, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  I know, and -- and then nobody likes to car pool.  It's really bad.
R:  I know, they --
L:  But I guess we --
R:  -- they don't have enough incentives to do it.  I mean, even here, you know, we've got carpool only lanes, you know, and there's not a lot of people in 'em.  And you can totally, you know, skip by all the other traffic but then there's not enough people that car pool so ...
L:  Yeah, so it doesn't seem to work.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so the question is like if -- if a b- unknown benefactor gave you a million dollars, would you never talk to your best friend again?
R:  No, this [MN] -- the stipulation would be that you couldn't talk to your best friend again.  They'd only give it to you -- this -- it's one of those kind of k- -- stupid situation things.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I don't know.  Would you do it?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that's really bad but I mean, if you had a million dollars.  I mean, I wouldn't want my best friends to know that but [MN] [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that's a lot of money.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean if you had a million dollars, you'd probably have some new best friends pretty quickly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  And not --
L:  I'd get over --
R:  -- to look too hard.
L:  -- it pretty quickly.  I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if it was -- the question was like, "Would you never speak to your child or your parent?" or something, then, er, that would be like a lot -- I wouldn't be able to do that but if it's just a friend.  And I know that sounds really bad but I think I would do it.
R:  Yeah, no, I -- I totally agree with you.  I mean, I know like -- I'd feel terrible if my best friend knew the answer to this question, you know, because it's kinda like, "What you don't value my friendship, you know, that much?" but [LAUGH] I mean -- I don't know, I -- I seem to meet friends wherever I go and whatever I do, you know, so --
L:  Yeah, it's like, who knows --
R:  -- I don't think that there's any one that's, you know, so irreplaceable.
L:  Yeah, I feel the same way.  Like, none of my friends I would -- I mean, I don't even think I have really a best friend.  Well, I guess I do but we seem to have like our moments, you know, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I, you know, I don't think she'd miss me very much because like she has a whole group of friends and it's like, she'd wonder like what happened but it would be like, "Okay, well, whatever".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm like --
R:  Now see if -- 
L:  -- "Well --"
R:  -- if they're a friend to like -- you know, I -- I consider my boyfriend my best friend also, you know, so if that was something well -- that would be a little bit more difficult, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I hope that the -- yeah, I -- I'm assuming they mean like a b- -- uh, a f- friend not a boyfriend 'cause like, yeah, that changes things.
R:  Right.  
L:  I don't think -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like I -- my boyfriend -- I don't consider him my best friend, thank God.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it wouldn't apply but that's an interesting question.  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  I don't know.  I mean, like, I think I'd go crazy [LAUGH] without him so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.  How old are you?
R:  I'm twenty three.
L:  Okay, cool.  You sounded kinda young still.
R:  [LAUGH] How old are you?
L:  I'm twenty seven.
R:  Oh.
L:  Twenty seven.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So ...
R:  That's how old my boyfriend is.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, how old?
R:  Twenty seven.
L:  Oh, oh, cool.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mine's forty four.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, whatever, right?
L:  Just a little --
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  -- older.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know I find it easier to talk to older people.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh ...
R:  Well, the thing --
L:  -- especially guys.
R:  -- that interests me about older people.  It's another one of those things.  It's, uh, bad but you know.  I mean, y- yeah, it's -- it's attractive how, um, most of them are successful, you know?
L:  Yeah, totally.
R:  -- and, er, you know, it's just they have and you can see that, you know, in business or whatever and they, you know, generally got a lot of money and they're pretty well traveled for the most -- you know, I mean, not all, you know, people in their forties or whatever but you start to see more people that have done that kind of stuff then you do, you know, with people in their thirties or twenties or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  I mean I'm divorced.  I was married to a guy who was my age and [LIPSMACK] it's like so immature 'cause, you know, how guys and girls are different and, uh--
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, I just couldn't take his behavior any more and I'm like, "That's it.  I'm not going out with anyone in their twenties any more" 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, uh, some aspects are really cool.  Like the -- the physical, kind of, he can keep up with you and like, "Oh, you know".  The kind of music you guys like but I have to tell you like it's so much easier with my older boyfriend just to --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to have a conversation.
R:  Yeah, I could -- I mean I could -- I get along with people, you know, that are twenty, thirty years older than me.  You know, I don't have a problem getting along with them so I'm sure, you know.  But, yeah, and I know there's a physical thing too though.  I mean, there's not as many attractive people that are older, you know.
L:  Yeah, that's so true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Most of my friends don't consider my boyfriend attractive but I don't know -- when you like someone I guess you kinda look past a lot of their, you know -- the things that your friends don't like about them physically.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right --
L:  Like I --
R:  -- well, yeah.  I mean -- I'm not -- I've never been one to let my friends, you know, judge my boyfriend or, you know, let that influence me.
L:  Yeah, I know.  It's like he treats me really well and, you know, he's really successful so it's like, you know -- and he's nice and he's kind to me so those are --
R:  That's -- that's the thing --
L:  -- that I like.
R:  -- the difference between women and men.  For women like a guy, you know, in our [inaudible] a guy can compensate for his, you know, lack of looks, if he's got like money or success or an awesome personality but for guys it's just not the same.  I mean, you know, if -- if you're this nasty woman, you know [LAUGH].  What guys would give to be nasty looking, you know.  It wouldn't matter if you were the nicest girl in the world, you know, or even if you had lots of money.  You know, guys don't care because they wanna be with a good looking woman, you know?
L:  Yeah, it's -- that's true.  Except for the one part I kinda disagree is like if the woman d- has lots of money, there are guys out there you will like go out --
R:  Gold diggers. 
L:  -- with her.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like g- gigolos, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I actually know one.  [SIGH] It's so disgusting.
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  Yeah, in LA, there you see like all kinds of people and there's like really young, like really h- handsome, like good looking guys who are just like totally used like older, like unattractive women who have money just to like --
R:  Gosh  I've --
L:  -- have a nice --
R:  -- I mean I -- there -- I know like, you know, strippers that do that, you know, with men but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I don't -- I've never heard of any [MN] [MN] [MN] younger guys doing it as well and I -- I -- I'm -- I'm sure it happens, you know.
L:  Yeah, there's all kinds of people.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L: So --
R:  So --
L:  -- how many of these --
R:  -- have you ever run into, um, any stars or anything in Los Angeles?
L:  Yeah, actually it's like kind of a common occurrence to go into restaurants, you see them all the time and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- I went to school with a few stars.  Yeah, 'cause I went to UCLA so like a lot of the younger actors also went there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like do you know the Wonder Years?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That show.  Um, Minnie was in my class.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] She's really nice.  Um, who else do I know?  Actually my boyfriend, Simon, is an actor.  He's in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a soap opera.  I don't know.  Do you watch soap operas?
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.  I don't either.  But he's like a l- -- a child actor and so my boyfriend gets to like meet a lot of celebrities.
R:  Wow.
L:  He goes to a lot of parties and stuff.  And I haven't been --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yet.  He hasn't taken me to any.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but like I'm dying to go just 'cause it's like I wanna actually talk to celebrities instead of just like seeing them in like -- at restaurants and stuff.
R:  Who -- who have you seen?
L:  Oh, man.  I've seen.  God, [MN] I just can't even think 'cause I've seen so many.  Drew Barrymore.  I was at a restaurant.  She was sitting next to me.  Um ...
R:  I mean, do people -- do they bother them very often or no?
L:  No, not in LA.  Just 'cause everyone's used to seeing them.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Um, but like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, you scare.  I mean, you kinda look at them and like, "Oh, man".  I wonder -- you know, you look over at them like more than you would to a normal person but --
R:  Do they -- 
L:  I mean, I've never seen --
R:  -- do they strike you as beautiful in person as they look like in magazines?
L:  A lot for the most part, they do.  And also they all look like really thin.  It's weird.
R:  [LAUGH] So, it's -- it's not just the magazines, like they're all thin in real life too, huh?
L:  Yeah, well they're not like -- I know there's a lot of airbrushing that goes on but for the most part like, [MN] yeah, they all look pretty much -- do look like perfect and -- oh, well, some of them don't.  I saw Cameron Manheim from the Practice --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at, um, Home Depot the other day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, that was [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  And it's the --
R:  Um, so I don't know, like are just like a normal sized person like a eight or something?
L:  No, I'm actually pretty small -- petite myself.  But --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like I'm just always like -- I -- I don't see myself that way.  It's so weird.  Like I'm a size two but like [MN] I'm always surprised at like how small my size is.  Like I'm always looking at clothes that are a lot bigger than me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And my boyfriend's are like, "Why are you -- why are you l- l- --"
