R:  No, they're not.  Over here it's a lot of well [SIGH] [NOISE] -- well, New York City it's always problems w- with the schools [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- with the teachers -- with the teachers' aides, everything, [SIGH] it's always messed up.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  That stuff.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I mean they're trying to improve it.  They're trying to improve it.  [SIGH]  I mean I don't really know how it is in other states, you know.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Well, [MN] I mean even -- even I f- feel like I didn't get a good education, ah, going to public schools, you know, that I missed out on --
R:  Where did --
L:  -- some stuff.
R:  -- you go to public school ... in New York?
L:  Yeah, in upstate New York.  But, you know, --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- what I'm saying, like, I feel, like, [SIGH] there's things I didn't really learn in history class --
R:  Oh!  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I should've.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  That's true.  [NOISE]
L:  That kind of thing.
R:  I went to school out here in Queens -- I mean I feel it was all right [NOISE] you know?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I mean it wasn't the best, but [NOISE] you gotta deal with what you got.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That's the way I see it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]

L:  Oh, cool!
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  M- my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my [NOISE] third time calling this.  I guess this is my last time calling it too.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  'Cause I think you got to call three times.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, this time I got through r- right away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sometimes, ah, it --
R:  How many times have you called?  [SIGH]
L:  This is my -- my last time.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And I guess they send you your check or whatever?  [SIGH]

R:  How did you get the number?  [SIGH]
L:  Um, through Money and Shopping ... dot com.
R:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]  Yeah, I got it through a friend.  [NOISE]

R:  And I called, like, two other times.  It's surprising all three times they've p- put me on with a girl --
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- u- usually everyone says they put you on with a guy -- a guy.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  That's funny.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  Yeah, well, you know, it's cool.  So, like, what would -- what would you do if you could [NOISE] do anything to change t- the public school system?
R:  Oh, get more teachers, [NOISE] better teachers, better f- facilities, better supplies, you know?  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Just start again.
L:  Yeah, I think too like the bo- -- the text books are all, like, kind of [SIGH] worn --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- and torn apart and sometimes they're just there.
R:   -- get up to date stuff.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  More computers.  [SIGH]  Better food, you know?  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, the food in those cafeterias are pretty nasty.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, I mean New York they try to improve but, you know, [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- they got to improve everything [NOISE] in all the, [SIGH] you know, states.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Yeah, I think p- public school systems aren't t- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- g- good for the most part --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially, you know, o- ones I work in.
R:  Private schools are a lot better.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Well, they just -- it seems like that they offer more programs geared towards --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- college and stuff.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  You know, like the -- they'll help you figure out more of what you want and --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, exactly.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  See -- they don't waste time but [SIGH] --
R:  So, what do you do for a living?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Ah, a bunch of stuff.  [SIGH]  Everything.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, well that's nice.
L:  Yes.
R:  How long have you been living out there for?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  J- just, like, ah, six months --
R:  Oh, you just got --
L:  -- not a long time.
R:  -- there from New York?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just came out.
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  That's cool.  Do you like --
L:  Yeah, I love --
R:  -- it so far?
L:  -- New York, though.  The people in New York are real, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't try to be [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever, [SIGH] fake.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really!  [SIGH]  I -- I love --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- New York.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I mean I'll -- I'll go somewhere, like, Florida but not California, too many earthquakes.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I've only been through one [SIGH] so far but ...
R:  What earthquake?
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  How was it?  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [SIGH] --
R:  Scary?  [SIGH]
L:  -- [MN] I was sleeping and then it kind of woke me up so --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- it wasn't bad, you know.
R:  You moved out down there all by yourself?  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Um, no with my husband.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, so you're married and the whole thing.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  The whole thing.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, does he call this too?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I told him too, I don't know if he did it yet.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  For -- for some extra money, right?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I think it's a great thing, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean I think you can only do it once and that's it.  I don't think they'll call back after --
R:  Just once a day for three days.
L:  But I mean after that, when you do the three days [NOISE] you can't do any more --
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  -- right?
R:  -- it.
L:  How many times have you called?  Three days straight or ...?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, this is t- the third day.
L:  Oh, so you should get one check for thirty dollars.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah, [SIGH] I mean that ain't bad, you know.  [NOISE]  I mean, like I said I'm just calling -- my last time I said, "Let me call, get it over with".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Tuesday they didn't send me anything, you know?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I -- it should work.  It -- it's through Pen State so [NOISE] I'm sure --
L:  Yes, in fact 'cause I work for, ah, [SIGH] -- I don't work for Pen [NOISE] you know, Pen State but I work -- I'm a doorman for [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for, ah, [SIGH] -- not -- for a private club --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- and it's called the Pen Club.  It has to do with -- it's the -- it's the [SIGH] private fraternity of Pen University.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, when I called it sounded, like, Pen -- and I'm, like, "I work for that company" y- [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and stuff.
L:  That's neat.
R:  Where did you live in Manhattan?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Um, down by like -- like, the City Hall area.
R:  Oh, where --
L:  Downtown.
R:  -- the World Trade Center was?  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yep.  Down on John --
R:  Oh, so you lived --
L:  -- John Street.
R:  -- over there when it happened in nine eleven?  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]  So, --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know.  Are we supposed to stay on topic or --
R:  [NOISE]  Ah, it's --
L:  -- does it matter?
R:  -- ah --
L:  No, I know -- no, I know, I mean like that I'm just --
R:  Well the only times I called I really used to stay on topic but I never -- l- like you go o- off it 'cause it's like, h- how much more can you say, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah.  So, maybe they just --
R:  Unless they --
L:  -- they give you something so that you have something to talk about [SIGH] --
R:  And I guess they analyzing how we --
L:  -- and it's not, like, a- a- ah, --
R:  -- talk.  How we communicate.
L:  Is that w- what it is?
R:  I guess?  'Cause I don't think they expect you to talk for ten minutes on the main topic.  [SIGH]  I mean -- well the other time I called it was about smoking [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and alcohol.  Then last time it was about [NOISE] -- I forgot, unemployment or something.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  No, about the minimum wage [SIGH] [NOISE] --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  O- o- oh!
R:  -- should it be more or less.  And I mean I talked to a girl and we were talking but she was that young, she was sixteen.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] really?
R:  So, I was like, "Have you ever had a job?" [SIGH] you know?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  That's funny.  That's really --
R:  Yeah, but I --
L:  -- good.
R:  -- I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean I try to stay on topic but it's like how much more can you say about this [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or that?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I hear you.
R:  [NOISE]  You know, it's like --
L:  That's funny.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think they just record it --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I guess they analyze to see how we [SIGH] ... get along [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Yeah, I think that's probably --
R:  I don't know how -- what they do with this.  Who --
L:  Program.
R:  -- knows, um, our voices might be in a topic in a ... class at their college.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  They might play a -- a- ah, conversation.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  O- o- oh!
R:  I don't know.  I really don't know.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, whatever.  It's -- it's a cool, ah, thing that they're doing.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  I mean that's good.  [SIGH]  I guess that's a good school thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know, since other schools aren't that good I guess their school is good.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  That stuff.
L:  [MN]  So, you've lived in Queens your whole life?
R:  Y- yeah, Queens and Long Island.  [NOISE]
L:  And Long Island?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hear your accent.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, you do?
L:  New York accent.
R:  What my New York accent?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Of course.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  In New York, New York accent.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Things -- I don't know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- are you going to come back to New York to visit?
L:  [MN]  U- um, I might for, like, Christmas.
R:  [NOISE]  Have you got a family here?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, my whole family.
R:  O- oh!
L:  [MN]  So, ...
R:  But you live -- you lived more upstate, right?
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] outside the city.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, it's like me -- to me New York is, like, Manhattan, Queens, like the Boroughs.  [SIGH]  I forget there's, like, an upstate and all that.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, 'cause I know I've been to like, [NOISE] a- ah, what was that, ah, like, Woodberry, like, for the c- cold salads[?] and stuff but ...
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] like, I've never been to Albany.  And that's the -- that's, like, main shit -- that -- that's the capital, right?  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  Yeah, Albany's the capital.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, I'm just -- [SIGH] 'cause I feel that I think Manhattan should be the capital.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]  You know, I think --
L:  It should be actually.
R: -- 'cause everything about New York State is about New York City.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  No one says --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Well we're coming down to the good old Albany".  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I know -- but I don't know how Albany is -- is it like big or is it ...?
L:  You know, I've only been there --
R:  Okay, you see?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LAUGH] a few times.  A- ah, [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  I don't think it's, like, all skyscrapers and stuff like Manhattan.
L:  I don't think so.
R:  Y- yeah, they should make -- should -- I think Manhattan should be [SIGH] the capital.  So, I think that's t- the main stuff.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, --
R:  Everyone wants to come to Man- --
L:  -- definitely is.
R:  -- city -- New York City.  New York City.  I hear people saying come to N- N- New -- Manhattan, but Albany --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- "Let's go to Albany".  [SIGH]
L:  I know, I miss the city.
R:  Oh, it's strange.  It's strange.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  So, what else can we talk about the school?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what else to say.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I don't -- we -- I think it's going to end any second.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, it's going to come on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this t- the lady's going to say, "Say your goodbyes.  [SIGH]  You have thirty seconds to say goodbye".
L:  Y- yeah.  But --
R:  And stuff.  [SIGH]  I don't know.
L:  Okay.
R:  What time is it over there?  [SIGH]
L:  Ah, almost five --
R:  Oh, it's already --
L:  -- five to five.
R:  -- eight o'clock over here.  It's so hot.  It's ninety eight degrees here.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  Yeah, it's -- yesterday was a hundred and it's been a heatwave for the last three days.  [NOISE]
L:  W- wow!  Well, you guys need it after you had all that bad weather.
R:  Yeah, it's been raining so much.  [COUGH]
L:  Wow!
R:  But this whole three days it's been a heatwave.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh!
R:  And then electricity went out in Queens, already, with Colin[?] Edison -- shh.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  People using their air con- --
