R:  Hello, this is Jim Keifer in San Francisco and --
L:  Oo --
R:  -- who are you? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm Dawn --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in Baltimore. [LAUGH]
R:  Eh -- eh -- Dawn in where?
L:  Baltimore --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Maryland.
R:  Baltimore.  Hey, I have some relatives in suburban Maryland outside of DC.
L:  Oh, yeah, we- ca- California, it's a long way.
R:  Well, relatives sometimes get along better when they're separated by a great distance. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  My mother in law, yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There you go, well, we're in agreement --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- already.
L:  This is my first one from that far away. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, what, uh, is your take on this affirmative action in business?  Apparently it's in business, rather than government or education or anything.
L:  I don't know, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm torn between it, because to be honest with you, affirmative action to me is saying, "Well, you have to hire so many people of this race, and so many people of that race, and so many --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- handicapped and it's -- it's just a quota to me.
R:  Well, that's pretty much my take on it, too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, out here in San Francisco, uh, the anglos are the, uh, second -- oh no, they're the first largest minority, but we have no majorities in San Francisco.  Uh, th- th- after the whites come the Orientals and then the Hispanics and then the blacks.
L:  I figured out there'd be a lot of Hispanics, I didn't think Oriental out there. [NOISE]
R:  Uh, Chinatown, San Francisco, come on.
L:  I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I just didn't think that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean here -- I mean here we're pretty vast, I mean now we're getting a lot of Russians in [NOISE] --
R:  We get some Russians, too --
L:  -- you know, but --
R:  -- the other thing I --
L:  -- I -- I really, I don't think [NOISE] that the companies and college right now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- has pissed me off, because in order to get into a college, you get points, it's a point system --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- well, if you're black you get so many points --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if you're white you get so many points --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- if you're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Chinese, you get so many points, that's not fair.
R:  Right.
L:  You shouldn't judge these kids, 'cause my daughter's twelve now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- by the time she --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gets into college, I'm -- it's going to cost me an arm and a leg because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- she is not [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE] Uh, she is --
L:  -- uh --
R:  -- what?
L:  -- uh, she is not of any minority. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  Because she is a white female --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- born and raised here in America --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- she is going to have everything against her.
R:  [NOISE] And that's another thing, this sex business, um, [NOISE] females are physically a majority, but, uh, they're classified as a minority, again I can't understand it.  There's a lot of things I don't understand.
L:  No, 'cause there's just as many of us in the work field, but, we're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- still underpaid and overworked.
R:  Oh, I feel that way myself [LAUGH] sometimes. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I work in a man's field, I work in auto parts, I sell auto parts and people look at me and they're, like, [LIPSMACK] "Well, you don't know nothing about cars, you're a girl".
R:  Yep.
L:  Like, 'scuse me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've been in the field fifteen years, there isn't too much you can tell me that I don't know.
R:  Well, maybe you should move to the West Coast, here we have all sorts of, uh, unusual be- uh, occupations and unusual people to take part in them, too.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- be judged on your merits, on who --
R:  Ye-
L:  -- you are --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- not your race or gender.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I don't think they should say, "Well, because he's a man, he's a better mechanic --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- she's a woman, she's a better secretary".
R:  Yep.  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and "Oh, because he's Hispanic, he needs extra money to go to school, 'cause he's underprivileged".  So am I, I'm white, I'm underprivileged.
R:  [LAUGH] Yep.  Yeah, I can hear you.
L:  Yeah, my parents couldn't afford college [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I didn't get to go.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I don't know what they're doing, well, somewhere -- in California rece- uh, well, a couple of years ago, did away with race preferences in the University of California and the next year the number of, uh, minorities dropped, but the year after that they came back and now there are more than there were before, with, uh, still being no race, uh --
L:  No --
R:  -- preferences.
L:  -- affirmative action, which is exactly what that is.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And they just took it to court here in this state --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and because somebody --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fighting it, saying that it was illegal, that it was stereotyping --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they lost.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They held --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it up that the colleges can give out the points for this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's not fair.  And I have lost a job because I am white, didn't make me happy.  Didn't make -- well, it made me mad --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I can understand --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that these big companies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have to have so many minorities.  I can understand that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't have to like it.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know, I don't -- it's not my thing, but, you know, whatever.
R:  Yeah, I was, um, my work experience, my career was in the government --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, we had all sorts of people, uh, there, completely non discriminatory --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, everything seemed to work well --
L:  Government --
R:  -- in fact it --
L:  -- takes everybody. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think the, uh, best regional director I ever had was a black lady and my God, did she have a mind on her.  Wow, she could understand things at a glance that other people would take several paragraphs to describe it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to them. [LAUGH]
L:  My boss right now is a black lady and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- very intelligent, very good at her job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, but mainly in my -- my area we get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- looked down at because of females --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not because --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- of our color or race or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, because we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are females, so we must not be able to do the job.  You --
R:  Well --
L:  -- know and that's not right.  And all affirmative action does is, in my opinion, is bring up racism and things like that that people wanna forget.
R:  Well, it's, uh, also s- they -- they pick who they're going to, uh, take to court or whatever.  For instance, most of the Railway porters are black, well, if I wanted to get a job there I might not get one because I'm white. [MN] Uh, am I supposed to be, uh, upset about this?  I mean, it's --
L:  I would be.
R:  -- evident -- [LAUGH] it's evident that there's an unfairness going on here, but, uh --
L:  I mean, if --
R:  -- no p-
L:  -- it's a job you want and you're qualified for --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- it shouldn't --
R:  -- mhm.
L:  -- matter what race you are or what nationality you are.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I don't walk around saying, "Well, I'm German American" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's bullshit.  I'm American, I was born and raised here.
R:  Right.
L:  Yes, my heritage is German, but I was born and raised here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm an American.
R:  Mhm.  Actually some of the best Americans we have out here are or- are Oriental and Hispanic. [LAUGH]
L:  But, do you --
R:  Bu-
L:  -- hear them saying, "I'm Hispanic American"?
R:  Uh, the ones that are accomplishing things don't, the ones who want to find an --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- excuse for not accomplishing things do. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  And there are [NOISE] a number of intelligent people of all races out there. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Course, seems all the doctors here are ara- Arab, some type of Arab.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  M- my doctor himself is -- is a foreigner.  I have a hard time understanding him, but he's a very good doctor.
R:  Right, uh --
L:  You know, I need a translator, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah, my dentist is from El Salvador, but, uh, he was essentially raised here, so he speaks perfect English.
L:  Yeah, and he says, "I'm American".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, "That's what I am".  And, or, like I said, to me all it does is cause problems.  And I'm --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- not into problems.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- think people are --
L:  -- care what happened two hundred years ago, I was de- I wasn't even born.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  I wasn't even born back then, I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- know and I don't care --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know, why punish today for what you really -- and -- and I understand it because you did need it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- say, fifty to a hundred years ago, you did need it because of the discrimination, I understand that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's like anything else, it had its time, its time is gone.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Let it go.  Move on with your life, be an adult, be a -- not an adult, [LIPSMACK] what's the word?
R:  Mature?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Be mature about it.
L:  Be mature and -- and get past it.  Don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- use what happened two hundred or so years ago as your crutch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because that happened to somebody other than you, that didn't happen to you.
R:  My sister in law one time asked me, uh, what I thought about retributional payments to the blacks, uh, for past slavery, [LIPSMACK] and I said I fully believe that, uh, every person who was a slave should be -- get rep- uh, should get a retribution payment from anybody who was a slave master.
L:  It works for me.
R:  So -- yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause they're all dead.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You know, the same way with when the Germans killed, when the Nazis killed the Jews --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I feel the same way.  I don't care if they get retribution from the ones who committed the crime.
R:  Right.
L:  Not from the ancestors, because a lot of them don't even know what a -- what a Nazi is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it -- it has been that long.  Yes, there are a few Jews left and there's some Germans left too, running around, but they're old.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they're very old --
R:  Ready to kick the bucket any time. [SIGH]
L:  You know, my grandfather --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- came over from Germany --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, he didn't have any of his records, they burned all his records and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he never complained, he come over here, he worked his ass off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, he's an American and he'll -- he would have ...
