L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Hi, good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what?  I didn't understand the, um -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- if who was gonna leave me a million dollars?  A benefactor?
R:  [MN] An unknown person.  It's just somebody --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- we -- yeah.
L:  [NOISE] And then what -- what wouldn't we -- [MN] if, er -- what wouldn't we be allowed to do?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I didn't get it.
R:  Um ...
L:  It was ...
R:  [MN] [MN] Yes, they w- said it -- they said it pretty quickly.  It was kinda hard to catch.  I guess, um, if an unknown benefactor --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gives you --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- a million dollars?  I'm not sure how much --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but you couldn't talk --
L:  But you'd never --
R:  -- to your best friend.
L:  -- be allowed to talk to them again or something like that.
R:  Your best friend --
L:  I don't -- I don't -- 
R:  -- ever again.
L:  I think [NOISE] --
R:  That'd be really hard.  I don't think I could do that.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] just start talking then.  Um, [SIGH] um, I don't know.  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I never thought about something like this.
R:  No.
L:  Um ...
R:  Not when there's like a --
L:  I mean, wouldn't --
R:  -- stipulation on it.  That's too much.
L:  Would you take it though?
R:  There's other ways to communicate.  Uh, that'll be really hard.  [LAUGH]
L:  Excuse me?
R:  That would be really hard because you could still give them some money.  I wonder if --
L:  What do you mean?
R:  You could still give them s- -- you could -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can't talk to them but you could still --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- like help them --
L:  See, I didn't quite --
R:  -- help them out.
L:  -- get it.  I'm not sure if that's the right thing.  I just h- heard if you got, um -- if a benefactor gave you a million dollars but you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would never be and then I don't know what it was.
R:  Mm.  This is [inaudible] too.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you know what it was?
R:  Yeah, it was t- to not talk to your best friend.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  Ever again.
L:  Um, hmm.  [NOISE]
R:  But I'm thinking --
L:  No --
R:  -- that you could --
L:  -- I think I would do it.
R:  You could still at least -- you would do it?
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think so.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean it -- I don't know.  It'll be hard but I- I'm sure that both of us would understand.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  And maybe I would give her part of it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  I'm think- --
L:  See, um, I would probably do it.  I mean because it's not you're leaving them.  I mean, I don't know.  No, I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- think I'd do it.  [NOISE]
R:  But it -- huh.
L:  It sounds hard but I would.  [MN] What about you?
R:  I think, yeah.  It would be really nice to be able to help pay off some debts from both of us and so ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  But, um -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but yeah, I think they'd understand.
L:  How do you think your friend would feel about it?
R:  Well, there's two friends I can think of.  One would be really mad and the other one would be really excited.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  To get the money and to get paid off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm, 'cause we're actually not talking to each other right now anyway so [LAUGH] ...
L:  Oh, so this wouldn't be a problem.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right now.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  I'll have to email her that.  That's funny.
L:  I don't know.  Whoever I [NOISE] -- I don't know.  I guess, I don't know, they would understand it.  [NOISE] You know, I think some -- but if it was, for example, I could never talk to my mom again, I would not do it.
R:  Mm, that's true.
L:  [NOISE] What about you?
R:  So if -- family members, yeah, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- different.  No, I don't think I could do it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for family.
L:  Or boyfriend or something?  No.
R:  N- --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- no, I wouldn't call a b- -- I think a best friend would have to be not a -- not like a lover or not family.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I agree.
R:  So, if we can --
L:  Because, yeah, if it was my family, no.
R:  -- if we can define what it is, yeah.  The family that would be too hard.  That's not -- that's more than a best friend.
L:  Yeah.  But now I'm thinking, you know, we're talking about it but something like that is never going to happen anyway so [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  [LAUGH] You never know. Maybe they're listening to the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- conversation --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to see what we would do and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um ...
L:  Oh, and then they will --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- try it.  See if you were lying or not, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  I don't know.
L:  What do you think most people would do?  [NOISE]
R:  Oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it would depend on their situation and their friends.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like what their -- their situation is with all the other friends that they have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [MN] Of course they are ...
L:  Do you think most people would probably do it or not do it?
R:  I don't think so.  I really --
L:  No?
R:  -- don't think so, mhm.  Because you don't know who you're turning down so it doesn't -- it's not like your offending them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not like --
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  I mean that's just a silly stipulation.
L:  Yeah.  I guess --
R:  You're right i- --  
L:  -- you know, maybe I'm just saying this.  But it -- if it was really the case, I probably wouldn't do it either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  
R:  I don't know.  How long --
L:  Maybe I just think, you know?
R:  -- have you known your best friend?
L:  You know what, they change, um, the -- my best friend right now, I -- I've been -- how long have a known her?  Like a year -- not even a year.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, it's kinda like.  I don't know.  I only have one friend left from when I was a kid.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we don't really talk a lot.  We talk maybe twice a year.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause we don't get along that well anymore.
R:  Yeah, things change.
L:  So -- so I don't really have like a, you know, long term close best friend.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN] So, yeah -- so, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What about you?
R:  I have a couple of friends that I've known for at least fifteen plus years.
L:  Wow.
R:  Ya.
L:  That's a --
R:  They've been --
L:  -- long time.
R:  They've -- we've gone through a lot together.  Um ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't -- I couldn't imagine not having them around so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I don't think I would --
L:  See, th- that's different then for you a little bit.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I like my friend really, you know.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she's really close to me.  But it's just been just a year [LAUGH] not even --
R:  Ya, it takes a long time to just allow friends to be and go through those ups and downs together.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, nope, that's --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- not something I could give up.  Mm mm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  Uh-huh.  That is interesting though [SIGH] and, um, do you think what type of person, i- if it was a --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- benefactor, why would they put such a -- a restrain on a gift like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is something that is not quite clear to me either.  Why would somebody --
R:  It's --
L:  -- you know, actually demand something like that.  
R:  It's not like the -- what's the movie?  Um, honeymoon in Los Vegas where he gives her a million dollars to sleep with him.  It -- 'cause th- the --
L:  Isn't that --
R:  -- benefactor isn't getting --
L:  -- the Indecent Proposal?
R:  What's that?
L:  Wasn't it called -- Demi Moore -- wasn't Demi Moore and R- Robert Redford in it?  Is that the one?
R:  I think so.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, there's a couple like that.  I think there's a Nicholas Cage, I thought.  Um ...
L:  Oh, that was [inaudible] -- yeah, okay, okay, I know which one you're talking about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so this movie's slightly different.  Mhm.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, what were you gonna say about this movie?  I'm sorry I +interrupted you.
R:  Oh, that's okay.  So, it's like the, um --
L:  [NOISE] Hold -- oh, I have another call.  Can you hold on one second?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know I'm not supposed to but ...
R:  Sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  [PAUSE]
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] [MN] [MN]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Okay, I'm right here.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] [LAUGH] Sorry.
L:  Hello, I'm sorry.
R:  Hi, no, my cat was just, um, attacking something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Just forget it.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, yeah, what were you going to say about this movie?
R:  Oh, um, th- like the -- in their hypothetical question, the benefactor doesn't [MN] get any rewards --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like in the movie.  In the movie the guy obviously gets some --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- reward.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I think he also does it just because he's kinda like vicious.  I don't think he was really interested in that girl.  I think he mainly did it to see if money could destroy a relationship.
R:  [NOISE] Mm, it's a power trip thing, ya.
L:  Yeah, that's what it seemed more to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because in the end --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- he actually left her something and he said.  He said something like this.  [SIGH] But, yeah, in this case the benefactor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doesn't really get anything.  But, yeah, maybe he just wants to test --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know?  See how --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- important money is [NOISE] to people -- to certain people.  Maybe that's what it is.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] That could be.  Wonder how they come up --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with these ideas.  Because a friend of mine has done this calls and they had the topic of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sports on TV.
L:  I know.
R:  [SIGH] It's like, "Oh".
L:  I've had that too.  They were different.  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've had different ones too.  This one is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hard.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And, um, so w- what do you think -- do you think we would have to pay taxes on this mil- [NOISE] on the million dollars.  Probably, yeah, right?  [NOISE]
R:  What's that?
L:  So we have to pay at le- -- you'd probably have to pay at least like twenty five percent taxes.
R:  Oh, [NOISE] that's true.
L:  And so actually --
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  -- you're only getting -- yeah, I think so.  Because if you win like a car or something, you have to pay a lot of taxes too.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  Probably.  [NOISE] So, it wouldn't be worth it.  It wouldn't be worth it.
L:  Not really.  [NOISE] 
R:  No.
L:  No, I guess not really.
R: It -- that's funny.  Because my boyfriend and I talk a lot about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] -- how -- what kind of [NOISE] best friends you have.  [NOISE] Whereas he talks to his best friends at least every week.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Once or twice a week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whereas my best friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can go several -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like a month or two without talking to them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I'm okay with that.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And he doesn't understand it.  And so, this is -- this is a good question --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of -- I mean, I don't -- we're both just as close to our friends even --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- though that closeness --
L:  Oh yeah, you just have a different --
R:  -- looks different.
L:  -- type of relationship?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  He doesn't un- --
L:  But see [inaudible] --
