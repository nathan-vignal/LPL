L:  Hey, I'm Brett.
R:  Hi, I'm, uh, Theresa.
L:  Hey, how's it going?
R:  Hey, how you doing? [LAUGH] 
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Okay. [COUGH] Um, I'm from New Jersey.
L:  Uh, I'm Flor- -- I from [NOISE] Florida. [NOISE]
R:  Florida, right now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow, it's so hot here right now.  I can't take it. [LAUGH]
L:  It was a hundred earlier today.
R:  Ooh.  Yeah, that's about how -- how much it hit here today too.
L:  Well, anyways.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So, uh, if you could get a million dollars and not talk to your best friend ever again, would you do it?
R:  Oh, I -- I don't think I could do that.  No way.  She's been through -- with me through so many situations and, um, you know, I mean, I -- I know I definitely could use the money right now because times are pretty hard here but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't think I would do it.  How -- how about yourself?
L:  I think my best friend owes me about a million dollars.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, no I don't -- I don't think I could.  Uh, that's -- that's -- that's some heavy stuff right there.  Like -- you know, like you said, my best friend's helped me through a lot of stuff.  
R:  Yeah, 'cause, you know, I've been through some times where, um, about a few years ago where I -- I had a whole bunch of friends and they all turned their back on me because, uh, you know, it was just a whole situation but, um, and that really -- bes- -- you know, there's been other times but that really taught me how the value of friendship is so, you know, I really couldn't put a money factor on that.  You really need people, you know.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You re- -- you really need like -- you know, if you've got one good friend that's really all you need.  I don't have a whole lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- friends but I -- I've got like a few, you know.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Oh, there we go. [MN]
R:  That's interesting though.  I mean --
L:  Huh?
R:  Just think a million dollars, you know, "Wow, that'd be great", you know.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that'd be a tough decision for me.  It r- -- it really would.  Like my friends are idiots.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I -- I could take the million dollars and get some new friends.  Just new.
R:  I'd like to see how they could enforce it.  I mean, really, are they gonna spy on you all the time or something?  You know?  I mean, I probably could get like another phone line or something like that where they wouldn't be able to find out.
L:  Well, if -- if I was -- if I was gonna do something like that I would write up a contract and have you sign, "Like, okay, but you can never talk to this person ever again".  And if anyone ever sees you talking to them then, "Ha ha, you owe me a million dollars". 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  That would make an interesting legal case.  I'd like to see how they could enforce that because, you know, just like a prenup thing they could probably prove that under duress, you know, you, you know --
L:  Well, yeah, it's a -- it's a binding contract.
R:  Mm.
L:  And if both parties have signed it then you're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty much out of luck.
R:  I wonder if you -- i- if talking is one thing.  How about if you instant email them? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's a -- that's a good point.
R:  Or maybe you could just do sign language or something. [LAUGH] That'd --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- be a lot of work. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- I don't know.
R:  But, um, makes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- me think, "Uh, here we go.  Here's another, um, idea for a reality show, you know?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um --
L:  No, I -- I could do that.  Heck.  Besides that's a really long reality show.  The rest of your life.
R:  Yeah, I know, right.  It was fun[?] to think about, you know.  'Cause, um, you know, I think a lot of people underestimate how much money they need.  I mean, you know, like ten years ago when I was a little younger it wasn't so bad but like now I started to think, "God, if I'd only saved that st- instead of spent it", you know.  But, you know, who would've known that, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes it's, you know, you have to have just[?] some good times too otherwise you know, life just stinks.  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Where abouts in Florida do you live?
L:  Um, right outside of Orlando. [COUGH] On north side of Orlando.
R:  Oh, okay.  'Cause I was thinking about moving to Tampa recently.  
L:  I al- -- I almost moved out there to St Petersburg which is like St Petersburg, Treasure Island, which is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more on the coast.
R:  Yeah, it's nice.
L:  Really nice.
R:  Wow.
L:  Uh, huh.  Uh, I got not -- not mu- -- too much to talk about on this topic.  They're not doing too well here.
R:  Yeah, I know, like [LAUGH]   Um, well it's interesting to think of the legalities of it because honestly I mean I really think that they couldn't really stop you from doing it if you really ha- -- you know, if you did find something like that.
L:  Yeah, if -- if you wanted to talk to your friend they -- they couldn't really keep you from doing it.  But I -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I personally -- I know that I -- I couldn't -- I wouldn't wanna try to pull it off where I'd take the money and just then, you know, and still talk to my friend anyway because I think that would, you know -- I -- I just know that -- I'm -- I'm kinda like a bad liar, especially when it comes to law enforcement.  So, [LAUGH] you know, I don't think I could, uh, I don't think I could pull it off. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, like some of the moments me and my best friend have had, uh, aren't even worth a million dollars.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, and a million dollars is a lot of money.  That -- that's some pretty hard stuff. [COUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  'Cause, um, [MN] I mean, I know a lot of people think, "Well, with just one million, you know, how much is that?"  I mean, you know, it's just -- it's not that much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but when you think about investing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it and everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like that.
L:  The -- the million dollars wouldn't even last me very long.
R:  No, me either.  I mean, I live right near New York and the first thing I do is go shopping, you know?  Go -- or -- or start booking trips right away. [LAUGH]
L:  The first -- the first thing I would do with a million dollars is buy a house, buy a car, give money to the school; probably hell give -- give enough money to the school for 'em to build a new school and purchase the old school.  That way I'd have like a fifty room house.  That'd be fun.
R:  Oh, yeah, I'd wanna   I -- I definitely would -- would -- would buy a house too.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think -- I don't --
R:  I -- I wonder why I didn't think about that before.
L:  I don't -- I don't think the money would last long enough for me to make it worthwhile.
R:  Yeah, I always think a million isn't enough.  Like I'd need a couple, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like -- like when they have the -- the powerball or something.  It's like a hundred and fifty, then I'm like, "Oh, yeah --"
L:  Yeah, you got a hundred million dollars, you know.
R:  "-- That's more like it".  You know. [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I -- I'd probably do it for a hundred million.  I -- I have to say my fr- -- my best friend isn't -- isn't that -- isn't that good. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm.  Yeah, if it was a hundred million, well that would --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kind of turn the tables.  You know, they have to up the anti a little bit. 
L:  I -- I could build a new friend for a hundred -- with a hundred million dollars. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, right.  'Cause then -- the- the- then you look at the other person and say, you know, "Well, what if we have a really bad fight, then I'm gonna feel like a jerk for not even taking it, you know?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 'Cause, y ou know, sometimes you just never know.  I mean, I've had friends like in high school.  I don't talk to them any more and, you know, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from time to time I'll have di- disagreements with the -- with the ones I do have and, you know, sometimes we don't talk for quite a while and somet- -- one time I thought I would never speak to them again --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, so definitely   I -- I think it'd have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be more than a million dollars though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, for me not to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talk to somebody again. [NOISE] 
L:  I mean, my -- my best friend has taken a lot of -- like a lot of heat for me.  I mean, in turn I've taken a lot for him --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And y- you -- you can't just throw that away.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, I'm on the phone.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Sorry.
L:  Not even for a million dollars.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, sure. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I've had some moments where I would definitely say that my friends have been there for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, some -- some really important times like, um, when some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- relationships have really turn bad and -- and -- and that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what's -- what's kind of important, you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'Cause, uh, sometimes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you just, you know, your whole world can just turn over, you know, and you just don't know.
L:  [NOISE] E- exactly.
R:  I think sometimes in a way friends are more important than family, you know.  Sometimes [NOISE] they're like a part of your family.
L:  I mean, I -- my -- my best friend went through some depression actually tried to commit suicide --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- which was awful, I mean, but all his other friends bailed on him because he did that, you know, and honestly I was thinking about doing it too.  You know, you can't   But it's -- it was that kind of -- that type of action that made him wanna do it the first time so I couldn't do that and [inaudible] let him do that again, you know, and I think --
R:  Well, it's hard if somebody's down.  You know, you try to cheer 'em up but sometimes they're so down there's nothing you personally can do about it.  I mean, I -- I had a friend like that too.  I mean, he would just s- sit in a room and not even, uh, talk to you -- you know, for a while and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm like, "Well, buddy what did you come over here for anyway?" [LAUGH], you know.
L:  But it -- it pla- --
R:  And, um, after a while sometimes it can really grate on you.  I -- I, you know, I had a friend who was like bi polar and she just wouldn't stop talking. [NOISE] I mean, we were literally --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- on a trip and she just wouldn't stop talking for like two hours. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she got hoarse after a while, you know.
L:  Yeah, but it -- it's like those type -- it's those type of moments right there it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  W- would you -- would -- I mean, it's like whe- -- if you're not there, you know, like if you weren't there at that perfect moment that person could be dead.
R:  Mhm.
L:   Would you give that up for a million dollars?  Would you give up -- it's like would you give up that person's life for a million dollars?
R:  Nah, no I would -- definitely wouldn't.
L:  It's -- it's ab- -- for me that's what the decis- decision would come down to, I guess.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I think when people get money thrown at them if they just think about it -- it -- it can be really, you know, like, "Oh, wow, of course I want that", you know but you have to
