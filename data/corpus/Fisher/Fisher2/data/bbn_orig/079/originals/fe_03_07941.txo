L:  Hi, my name's Destiny.  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Marlene.  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  All right, thank you.  And you?
L:  Fine, thank you.
R:  Okay.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Inglewood, California.
R:  Where?
L:  Inglewood, California.
R:  Oh, California.  I'm just --
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause this is a New York question.  I was just curious why, you know?
L:  Oh, you're a New Yorker?
R:  I'm a New Yorker.  I [inaudible] in Queens.
L:  See, I wanna come to New York.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I've never been to California.
L:  It's nice and sunny.  [NOISE] 
R:  I'm sure.  
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Now we have to [NOISE] dis- discuss --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the -- the problem.
L:  Topic.
R:  W- is with education in New York City --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- right?
L:  Oh, in New York City?
R:  That's what I thought they said.
L:  Oh, I thought they were just meant in general.  Well, I don't really know --
R:  Well, that's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can -- maybe we just talk about education in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- general 'cause I -- I thought they said w- with New York but go ahead.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, my opinion, me, being younger --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and me have just graduated.  I guess, my opinion on, um, education, as far as in public schools, they tried to pass a law.  I think it was a -- it was actually like a measure.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Measure thirty nine or something like that.  Or measure forty.
R:  Right.
L:  On, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- taking out public schools and having everyone get like four thousand dollar grants or something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That will go towards schooling at -- at maybe a private school or somewhere else.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And it didn't go through so ...
R:  Right.
L: I [MN] just [MN] -- I mean, they have specific, I guess, [several inaudible words]
R:  What happened?
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  Oh.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  Oh.
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  What's happening.  Oh, the phone -- something wrong with it?
L:  Do you hear me?
R:  Do you hear me?
L:  I can hear you.
R:  Okay, now I can hear you.  Go ahead.
L:  Okay, I was just saying --
R:  So, you --
L:  -- a lot of schools --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- have reputations as far as the curriculum --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and whatnot.  I attended Inglewood High School and it being, as they say, a low -- they have a bad reputation as far as, you know, the curriculum and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- everything as compared to a, you know -- another school that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they boast about but a- all education is the same to me as long as the teachers are, you know, teaching it --
R:  And you --
L:  -- sufficiently.
R:  Right, and the student is willing to learn, I think.  Isn't that part of the, er, solution also.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  You know.
L:  That pays a -- that p- that plays a big role.
R:  Right, because just, I mean, whether you have good teachers or poor students, I mean, it has to be a combination of, you know?
L:  Right, and not just the good teachers who are spending time with the bad students on --
R:  Right.  Disruption in the c- --
L:  Getting them to stop disrupt, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  The disruption.
R:  Right.  I think that, uh, the problem with -- well, I mean, I'm not gonna just say about New York, but in general I think that it is a problem because there are, uh, many disruptions in a classroom.
L:  Right.
R:  And where the teacher spends more time trying to get the attention of the class.  You know, rather than being able to teach and then they have students that, uh, really don't wanna learn.  And they're just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- taking up space and wasting the class's time [NOISE] as well as the teacher's time.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Of course, I mean, I'm not saying that teachers shouldn't be earning more money but I -- I know as far as New York, we keep spending more money and we're not getting the results so I don't know if that basically is the problem.  Uh, of cour- ...
R:  I agree totally.  [MN] Uh, I -- it's stuff that I've witnessed throughout the duration of my high school career --
L:  Sure, you're younger --
R:  -- and --
L:  -- so you know what --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  
R:  Because I know that when -- I mean, I'm older.  When I went to school, th- th- the education system was wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm sure the teachers were underpaid then [NOISE] as they are now.  Maybe more so.  But I know that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, parents also, we'd [MN] -- parents would not put up with some of the --
L:  I was gonna say.  It seemed as though they were more involved with the teachers as well as the faculty --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- as far as the schooling for their children.
R:  Right, there was more respect for authority.  You know, you just couldn't go to school and say certain things or act out the way, I understand, the students are today.  You know, uh, and the parents would expect their children to do well whether it was academically or at the trade school.  Not everyone --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has to go to college.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, but they should learn basic --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] you know, English, reading, writing, arithmetic.  I don't -- I think that y- grad- -- and I don't mean you.  I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot of the students graduate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they can't write a sentence.
L:  Exactly.  And not only that but they -- some of them get by going throughout high school, you know, passing time away with those teachers who r- really don't take the time out to teach the students and they've just [inaudible] been getting by on the basis of just getting good grades in the s- -- in a class with a teacher who doesn't even care about being there.  [several inaudible words]
R:  Right, right.
L:  So, it really doesn't make them, uh, different. 
R:  No, and then when they go into the workplace --
L:  [NOISE] [MN]
R:  -- they're not able to get a job.
L:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, as far -- I mean, of unem- 
L:  Go.
R:  -- unemployment is down but they can't because they can't perform.
L:  Right.
R:  And they don't --
L:  Or they don't meet the requirements that they should by --
R:  Right.
L:  -- having at -- at least a high -- high school education.
R:  Correct.  Correct.  I mean, uh, it's a -- and that is the basis of our country.  You know, the youth and education because without it, where does anybody go?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Exactly.
R:  And, uh, I know we have a big problem in New York.  You know, and they keep pouring -- now the -- the um, [LIPSMACK] Supreme Court or whoever, I don't know, it just decided they're not, you know, putting enough money into the education system.  [NOISE] But I truthfully don't think that -- I'm not saying they shouldn't put more money into education but it's going into the wrong places.  I think there's a lot of waste.
L:  [MN] More s- -- exactly.  I mean they say they -- they've gotten so many millions for academics but just like we -- we supposedly had received five thousand for new books.
R:  Oh, where do- --
L:  Did we see any of the new books?  No.
R:  Did you see books?  No.  I think --
L:  No.
R:  -- somebody's getting something but it's not going --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to the student.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean --
L:  Not only that but they're paying for unnecessary stuff.  Re-getting, I guess, the gym floor done over and just --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- basing it on sport.
R:  R- right.  No, and I know like with the construction, er, here and you know, in our state.  [NOISE] They keep talking about construction.  I mean they put up school buildings.  They -- after they're completed, they're crumbling because everybody is looking to make a quick buck and not giving --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good work.
L:  Right.
R:  So, whatever they're doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is wasted.  Then they have to redo everything.
L:  They're getting what they paid for and then paying double in the end.
R:  Right.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, something's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- supposed to be a million dollars, at the end --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's two million and then it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- still not.  And then by the time they finished, they have to redo.  And as --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you say, with books and supplies, where is that money going?  Because I know --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- that the students aren't getting [MN] as you say, textbooks [NOISE] and other supplies.  Where is that money being used?
L:  Exactly.  I mean, they -- they feel as though they -- they sugar coat it, I feel.  They receive the money.  They get enough to have a classroom set.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And maybe a few extra but as far as having one for each student to be able to take a book [NOISE] home in each class that they're in, that's what the curriculum is supposed -- that's how -- that's the supplies that we're supposed to have.
R:  Right.
L:  We're not supposed to have to worry about a paper shortage or, you know, having to  [NOISE] share --
R:  [MN]
L:  --  books with a fellow student --
R:  That rid- --
L:  -- of ours because our class doesn't have enough [NOISE] for all, you know?
R:  Of -- of course.  Of course.  I mean, that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that is a waste.  I mean, how can you learn and not everyone has a [NOISE] computer.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and it shouldn't really be a requirement that --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- I mean, I'm not against -- I mean, I'm not that literate with, uh, computers but I'm not against that, but that should not be a requirement.  There should be -- you still should know to read a book.  Everything can't be handed to you.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when you press a button and it tells you.  I mean you have to write a report.  It's not the worst thing to have to go to a library.
L:  But even so, facts on the computer can -- I can easily create a website and just -- say, put in all this fictional information and have people just going by it just because it's up there and it's just a quick way to get -- get the job done.  Get the work done.
R:  Right, and then [NOISE] uh, really, and nobody knows if it's, uh, correct or not.  [LAUGH] It's just, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's there and, you know, it's easy.  You p- like as you say, you press a button and you've got that site and then you copy everything and you hand it in as a paper.  [LAUGH] You know.  But that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what it is.  I think they've taken away the creativity --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of -- of children.  You know, of students anyway.  You know, I -- I -- I mean, of course I'm old fashioned.  Went to the library --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and did research but I --
L:  Exactly.  
R:  -- I think it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- really good because it does teach you how to find the things and it's a little effort not this easiness and, you know, besides playing all the games on a computer.
L:  Right, and I think [NOISE] they've created that database as far as the web is because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- them -- them knowing -- the government knowing we have such a shortage in book supplies, not just in certain cities, but just about at every high school.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  I mean you have those few that do actually take time.  I mean, you know, the -- the private schools [NOISE] who --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uphold this, you know -- this prestigious background but as far as regular public schools if they -- they -- they create the web I think [NOISE] just to be lazy so that kids can just use that as a --
