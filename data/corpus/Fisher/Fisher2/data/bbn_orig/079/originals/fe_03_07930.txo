R:  Lucrecia.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Hello, this is Kelly.
R:  Hi, Kelly, How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, u- u- um, I guess on the -- the topic I would pick, ah, yeah, so [SIGH] there definitely needs to be a change in the, ah, school system.
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I have, ah, [SIGH] a student that I used to be a big sister for and, ah, [SIGH] she goes to a public school in Newark and it's been, um, [SIGH] a constant ... battle about whether or not to even send her because of safety issues.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  And, ah, p- part of the, ah, problem, I think is, [SIGH] ah, [SIGH] too much bureaucracy, u- um, too political.  I think that, ah, [SIGH] more, um, uniforms, ah, standardized, ah, methods and [SIGH] possibly, um, ... privatizing the school system.  But, ah, the problem with privatizing is you have to keep up a certain l-, ah, s- standard of --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- education.
R:  Yep, I agree.  [SIGH]  Um, I think I agree with the uniform part for sure.  I think, um, [SIGH] as I said the biggest problem that I've experienced is that the safety is a big issue for the kids.  In, ah, Newark public system [SIGH] there are t- too many kids per classroom also and [SIGH] so it's very hard f- for the [SIGH] adults to keep track of where the kids are and [NOISE] what they're doing.  And they run around in the halls between classes and, um, [SIGH] it's really not very well monitored.  It -- it's very hard for them to [SIGH] c- control where the kids go and what they do --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, and the neighborhood outside is so dangerous that [SIGH] getting them to school is a big problem [NOISE] ... as well.
L:  Yeah.  U- um, it's a -- it's a huge problem to tackle because [SIGH] education -- now the government is taking a role, of, ah, what -- [NOISE] I guess a lot of families should be doing.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, ah, [NOISE] you know, they're -- they're replacing kind of like a surrogate --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, parents --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- for a lot of, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lot of kids.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Right.
L:  And, ah ...
R:  There are a lot of kids don't have both parents either.  [SIGH]  A lot of kids, ah, their parents are not, [SIGH] um -- not home or not, you know, proper parents and they don't really pay attention to their kids and, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] um, ob- obviously in the Newark area there's a lot of drug abuse going on and a lot of --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] the parents are not ... really responsible for their kids at all.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I, [SIGH] um, agree with that.  I, -- [PAUSE] [SIGH] you know, I don't know what it would take to, [SIGH] you know, try to ... f- fix that unless it's -- you know, we first t- tackle the emotional problem at home --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] the, ah, disability that people come from ... disabled homes --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- dysfunctional homes.  Ah, [SIGH] -- ah, I think [SIGH] the s- school system, you know, pro- -- might reflect the, ah, situation of, [NOISE] you know, the families today in America [SIGH] along with the political, um, [LIPSMACK] a- a- ah, you know, observance that, "Oh, everything's okay".
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  I --
R:  I don't think they pay teachers well enough e- either.  My sister is a schoolteacher out in Seattle [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] she actually works for a Montessori school which is a private system but the ... p- public school system that she has friends and [SIGH] she's, a- ah, worked at on a part time basis, a- ah, [SIGH] ah, she's found that the, ah, [SIGH] the teachers can har- hardly pay a lot of their own bills with the money that they're making, [SIGH] um, through the school systems.  And, [SIGH] you know, there are -- there are street cleaners that make more money than the teachers do.  And -- and I think that that, [SIGH] you know, is a -- is a very big part of why we're having so much trouble, [SIGH] um, keeping the kids in school, because the ... teachers are not [SIGH] happy to be there and we don't have high quality teachers.  And teachers [SIGH] come and go so fast, they don't stay in the school systems very long just because, [SIGH] you know, the pay is so bad and -- and they can't afford to live o- on that.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  Yeah, and part of the problem is -- is -- is capital, -- ah, capitalistic, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- ah, society where, [SIGH] you know, supply and demand I guess --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and, ah, [SIGH] i- it seems like that -- [SIGH] the pay would go up because there's such a high demand for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- teachers but [SIGH] I -- I -- again I -- it's the [SIGH] -- it might be the, -- you know, the government, ah, bureaucracy that's [SIGH] --
R:  Well I don't think teachers are viewed as being important.  [SIGH]  I mean I think if you [SIGH] look at the fact that as I said sanitation people are making more then teachers, there's something very strange about that.  I mean, obviously, we need teachers [SIGH] as much as we need sanitation w- [LAUGH] workers [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but the sanitation people are the ones that are getting paid more.  Now obviously that's a horrible job.  I'm not wishing it on anybody but, [SIGH] um, somehow the teachers have got to be given more priorities.  And it's not just -- teachers in t- the -- the pri- private schools [SIGH] are not making any money either.  So, it --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- seems to be teachers in general [SIGH] are not ... t- treated with very high regard.
L:  [MN]  Yeah, and part of that problem is the distribution of, um, [NOISE] the classes --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and the -- the teaching system and also the administration.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, the administration gets a -- a lot more money, like, the upper d- divisions --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- than the lower divisions --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] and so I, -- you know, there's a [SIGH] big discrepancy between that.  And [SIGH] so y- yeah there -- there's a lot of [SIGH] holes and flaws in the ... public school system --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, ah, [NOISE] um, [SIGH] I just think that part -- t- the biggest problem is [SIGH] that America, u- um, is now r- replacing the families with -- or trying to, not replace the families, but [SIGH] --
R:  Give that responsibility --
L:  -- yeah, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- to the, ah, public school systems where it ... does not r- really lie.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Right.  Right.
L:  And, ah, [SIGH] --
R:  I think if teachers are [NOISE] responsible for teaching --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- behavioral [SIGH] problems, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- as -- as [NOISE] -- as well as just the, -- [SIGH] you know, nuts and bolts of how to read a book and how to, you know, balance a check book or, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you know, they're not [SIGH] -- they're not going to have a fair chance at it because t- they're spending all their times just disciplining the children and trying to [SIGH] get them to stay in the classroom and to be there when they're supposed to be there --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] and to do their homework and [SIGH] s- sit still and, you know, not to throw things at each other.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, you know, they're spending half of their time disciplining them and so they don't really have that much time to spend [MN] [SIGH] actually doing school work.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And, ah, I think if the US could just seriously take a look at other countries' education systems.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And not their higher education but, ah, you know, their lower education --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then, [SIGH] ah, just kind of, um, really do some analysis on why -- like, other kids from [SIGH] other ... countries come in with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- such good aptitude tests.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, ... you know, and, ah, if they could figure out, like, really specific, [SIGH] ah, r- reasons and why, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, then they could probably pick the best parts of those [SIGH] o- other countries' school systems --
R:  Right.
L:  -- while adding our own unique, you know, culture.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Well, I know in the, um, Japanese school system ... the parents are much more involved in homework.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Um, and the parents sit with them [SIGH] while they do their homework and it -- it's part of the, you know, tradition that the -- that the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- parents all do it together; that their --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- kids don't, [SIGH] you know, get sent to their rooms to do their homework the parents have to sit down with them and complete all of the, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- paperwork and make sure that it's done correctly and [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to help the kids understand and to do [SIGH] it with them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And the -- the parents are much more involved with the teachers as well there, so --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- they don't, you know, there's not as much separation between the two of 'em.  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Yeah, it's more of a cultural whole involved, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- um, the -- the kids, a- ah, get a sense of more respect for the -- you know, the whole teaching environment --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- where the teachers teach from and [SIGH] in particular I [COUGH] -- I went to Russia and I -- I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- know that in the classrooms there, the --the kids just really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- give a lot of respect to the teachers.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And, um, [SIGH] -- a- and this enables the teachers to be able to, [COUGH] you know, teach them.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Whereas h- here [SIGH] --
R:  Are the classes as big there?
L:  [SIGH]  U- um, they ca- -- yeah, t- there can, yeah.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But the -- the difference is that the kids are just much more, ... ah, they don't have the behavior problems that kids do here --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- have here and [SIGH] the kids here have the facil- -- y- y- you know, facilitative, ah, y- you know, um, [SIGH] they're not as respectful, I guess [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to other generations and [SIGH] so ...  And, also, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- it's not as political whereas t- they can -- in the systems over there they can use one book --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- for, like, the grades one t- through six.
R:  Wow!
L:  Like, for math.  Like, of course, they don't go through the whole book in, ah, first grade --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they go up through the chapter one.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  And then, you know, like it's a t- type of chapter where they pick out all the -- ... ten and then the second grade, you know, they go through that.  [SIGH]  So, they have the same book --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then -- and it's the same thing in high school where they get [SIGH] one or, -- you know, they get a few books --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and they stick with it.
R:  Uh-hum.  Yeah, it must make a difference.
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah, you see the kids today carrying these back packs, you know, on -- on wheels behind them because --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they've got so many different books [SIGH] that they've got to carry and I wonder how many of them they're really even using [SIGH] you know.  And that -- that's the other thing too that they don't seem to, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, put t- the b- books back into the system again, they don't use them again, you know, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I think the kids just stick 'em in a closet somewhere and [SIGH] it's not -- they should bring them back to the schools you know.  It seems to me th- that t- they could the [SIGH] books over and over again and it would --
L:  Right.
R:  -- make it easier for [SIGH] more kids to be able to get more of a benefit from them.  I think ... that the cost of all the textbooks has got to be, [SIGH] you know, one of the issues that they ... t- talk about when they're doing their budgets.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  It seems to me if they could use the books over again for other classes that would make sense.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, and, um, just use examples of other countries and see how they do it [MN] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And put --
