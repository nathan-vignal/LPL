L:  How you doing?
R:  Fine.  My name is Laurie.
L:  Hi, Laurie.  I'm Brandon Mercer from El Cerrito, California.
R:  And I'm from Mar Vista, California. [NOISE]
L:  Mar Vista, where's that?
R:  It's near Marina Del Rey, Los Angeles --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Culver City area.
L:  Yeah, I used to live down that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, what a great topic, huh? [MN]
R:  I- it is, there's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so much wrong with the whole school system, it's --
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  -- like, where do you begin?
L:  -- I was [inaudible] where to begin? [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  Well, you go first 'cause I -- I haven't -- I was actually just having a conversation at work today about all my thoughts, so, I guess --
R:  You know --
L:  -- I'd take all the ten minutes, so I'll let you go first. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's like, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] well, you know, outside the lo- the lottery not putting any money into the school system or not what --
L:  Yeah, what happened to that?
R:  -- we all thought it was going to be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when everybody voted for the lotto, na- even though --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I play it in the hopes I going to win some day --
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you know, there's just not enough money, they just -- there's not and -- and I don't think there's en- th- the teachers are underpaid, so they -- I don't think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- -- they really support the students enough.  They --
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  -- let people get by with minimal education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, I mean, I'm a prime example, I played softball and I didn't think about college until I was older --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- on my senior I wor- I had four courses and two of them were, one was calligraphy and the other was ceramics --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then I go to my job at twelve thirty, I got off at twelve twenty and then I'd --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- work and -- and all that kind of stuff but, you know, and my boyfriend at the time, who was twenty three and -- when I was in high school --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- I found out, like, ye- a couple of years later, when I moved in with him, that he couldn't read --
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  -- and it's like, and he got a diploma, he graduated --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, there is a lot --
L:  That's amazing.
R:  -- wrong with our [LAUGH] public --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- school system.
L:  Here -- here's my thought, my -- my wife's a school teacher, first of all --
R:  Great.
L:  -- and then she got laid off because the district can -- couldn't afford to keep, uh, the small class sizes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and w- we've been going to school board meetings and discussing the whole issue with all the teachers and here -- here's my thought on that, let's think about [LIPSMACK] trying to run a corporation the way our schools are run.  Imagine if all these CEOs and vice presidents had to bring their own pens and calculators and note pads and hole punchers.
R:  They'd cry.
L:  Imagine if they had -- yeah, yeah.  Imagine if they had to supply their own computers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for the meetings. [NOISE]
R:  They wouldn't do it.
L:  [LAUGH] Imagine someone with a masters degree got paid thirty thousand dollars a year. [LAUGH] They wouldn't do it.
R:  No.
L:  Imagine they had to work in the dilapidated classrooms without their own phone in the classroom, with no air conditioning, linoleum f- floors that haven't been replaced in thirty years, decaying cupboards of rotting wood, graffitied windows, next to a freeway with no parking.  Can you imagine [MN] our -- our --
R:  No, they [MN] --
L:  -- corporate world doing this?
R:  Number one's, teachers', uh, salaries should be double what they are now --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- and --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- and the larger class sizes, what is -- what's -- o- okay --
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  -- tell -- the picture there is not enough attention to the students.  Not --
L:  Exactly.  And --
R:  -- it's just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you just --
L:  -- the teachers all say it --
R:  -- can't spread yourself --
L:  -- you can't --
R:  -- that thin.
L:  You can't.  They have -- twenty five students is a good number, thirty five is impossible.  They won't get the attention they need.  The good students will do fine, the bad students will get worse.
R:  But they're just -- but they're gonna pass, that's the whole -- that's the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- problem, they're gonna -- they're gonna go ahead and get a diploma.  They are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going to.
L:  Well, that's -- that's the -- the --
R:  As long as --
L:  -- question that we --
R:  -- they show up.
L:  Yeah, well, California's now passed these, um, these entrance, uh, I believe these exit exams where they're supposed to be able to pass these pretty tough tests to graduate.  The question is, though, you've got, so far, I think the number is about sixty percent that haven't passed the math portion at least and they -- we have the first crop of students coming up now that will have to take these to graduate from high school.  So the challenge is, you know, if they have to pass these to graduate, will you have just an exorbitant number of people that can't even read and don't get high school diplomas and then can -- can never get a real job because they don't even have a diploma?  Is that what's going to happen?  Or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are they gonna get rid of the tests?
R:  They're not going to get rid of the tests.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't -- I don't think they will.
R:  I -- i- it's -- because they don't care to -- oh, the -- well, we need grunt labor workers.  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- personally, I was a grunt labor worker for a while, I di- 'cause I didn't go to college and then when I was twenty six, I said, "I gotta go to college" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I ended up going and, you know, to make a decent living and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- got my AA and then I went ahead and went to law school and got my, uh, just for my, uh, paralegal certificate, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- [MN] what do you do?  Did you go to college right after school?
L:  I -- I did, I went to -- I went to college and I'm a -- I'm a journalist.
R:  So, were --
L:  -- I --
R:  -- so, were you motivated in school by your teachers or were you an [LIPSMACK] -- wanting to learn or were you just motivated because you looked at the future as, "If I want to do what I want to do --"
L:  Mm.
R:  "-- I have to --"
L:  Yeah, a little --
R:  "-- go to school".
L:  -- a little bit of both.  I had an interesting experience with that.  I went to school, I was very, very fortunate, I went to school in Newport Beach, California, which is a pretty well to do community --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they had the kind of money to -- to pay for the good schools.  And then I went to school in Glendale and I went to college in South Central LA --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ah.
L:  -- and I -- I realized, you know, the experience I had in Newport Beach is not what everybody else has --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and these -- these rich folks, their kids get to do well and have these great educational experiences while the poor kids don't and therefore you can repeat this cycle and the poor kids never get out of these impoverished areas because they're not getting the education and the rich kids keep, you know, getting great educations and staying rich.
R:  Exactly.  Ex-
L:  And that's the -- that's the cultural divide we have.
R:  Now, when I was going to school, it's when they first started doing the busing schtick.
L:  Oh, right, right --
R:  And --
L:  -- mhm.
R:  -- that's -- that's -- that -- I'm forty years old, so it was when I -- when they first started doing that and that's when y- people that were going to bad schools were able to go -- 'cause I went to El Camino Real High School, it was a good school --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- the problem is these people had -- these kids had to get up so early in the morning --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they got home so late at night.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it was like --
L:  Yeah, it's crazy.
R:  -- they hated being there.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, you can't study on a bus or anything, that's --
R:  So --
L:  -- not going to work.
R:  -- what the solution there is, put in money in the school system in bad areas, just as --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as much as you would in a good area.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's still a public fricking school, for heaven's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- sakes.
L:  Precisely.  Yeah, i- it's un- it's unfair to have the little rich enclaves of -- of great schools when everybody else who can't afford to support their schools with high property taxes, uh, is -- is suffering.  They need to be --
R:  You --
L:  -- they need to be equalized otherwise we repeat these cycles and we have this -- this, uh, economic gap and you still have all the -- the -- [LAUGH]
R:  Do you have --
L:  You know? [NOISE]
R:  -- do you ha- do you have children?
L:  Uh, I will have a son in October.
R:  Oh, s- will you be putting him through the public school system?
L:  Well, we've been debat- [LAUGH].
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, I think the public schools are good and I would like to -- to have him in public schools.  I mean, I don't think they're good, but I think it's a good experience, I think with -- with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, you know, good parenting you can get through it.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- I like the idea of -- of being with a mixture of people so they get to see that they're --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- everybody else out there is -- there's all these different types of people out there.
R:  Until I went to junior high I [MN] didn't -- never saw a black person in school, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where I grew up --
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was, uh, you know, a ritzy part of the valley and it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it just was very yuppie and I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a- and just the way they talked and everything was just a -- a culture shock to me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so --
L:  It would be terrible[?], huh?
R:  -- if I'd been exposed to it earlier, then, no, that wouldn't have happened.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, of course, the first reaction was, "What -- what's going on here?"  I hated it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, they'd try to pick --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fights and but, you know, once I stood up for myself and everything went well 'cause it was, you know, God, right when [inaudible] right happened right away when I started that, so, it's just real, you know, interesting on how they'll spend money on busing but they won't spend --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- money on the system.  Lotto --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- puts a lot of money -- the Lotto makes so many millions of dollars a week --
L:  Yeah and it's --
R:  And it ju-
L:  -- not putting as much into schools as it should.
R:  Not and [MN] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, uh, no, there's a lot of greedy hands getting in there, but it's not --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- going into schools.
L:  Yeah, that's the problem, there's all these other things going on in the state that -- that's -- that are diverting money from the school as well and our -- our state budget crisis is not helping the situation --
R:  It --
L:  -- which is what happened in my area --
R:  -- and they need --
L:  -- of the state.
R:  -- to put computers in -- in all the school systems.
L:  [MN] Oh yeah, if kids -- if kids don't know how to use a computer by the time they graduate they're [LAUGH] --
R:  They're history.
L:  -- they're worthless.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they -- everything is computer based today.
R:  They are flipping burgers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, because everything --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is going to --
L:  Maybe not even then, they've got computers at McDonald's, too. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, that's true.
L:  [LAUGH] You know?
R:  [LAUGH] It's, uh, you know, it's the future, it's -- everything's going to be electronic one day, I'm -- I mean, not everything, but it's just, one day we're going to say, "Wow", I mean, you look at it -- you look at it now and say, "Wow".
L:  Mhm.
R:  I remember, you know, when we first got Atari, remember Atari?
L:  [LAUGH] I loved Atari, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and Pong --
L:  I remember that, uh-huh.
R:  -- and now --
L:  And --
R:  -- things are so, gosh, they're just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so advanced --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- you know, the games and stuff that they have now, but it wouldn't cost that much to put --
L:  No --
R:  computers --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- in classrooms.
L:  Yeah, think a- think about it, if -- if you treated schools a little more like a corporation, and if you ran them so they had balance a budget, um, you know, and you -- and you gave them some of th- the same kind of things a corporation have, you'd be in good shape.  And they -- they  can't be run like that 'cause they're -- they're a different model, obviously, but they -- there's some lessons to be learned and I think sponsorship is a go -- I think corporate sponsorship for schools will work.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah, um --
R:  -- that'd be great.
L:  Oracle, Microsoft, they all want to advertise and -- and make money.  You know, why not have them sponsor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a school, you can have, uh, you can have the Microsoft Gymnasium or something and -- and give -- gi- have them donate software for tha- that right to n- to name it.
R:  That'd be great.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And there's actually  --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- been, uh, some schools --
R:  -- that would really help.
L:  -- up where I live trying to do that.
R:  Really?
L:  But they -- they've -- there was a lot of resistance.
R:  You know --
L:  I think it's a great idea --
R:  -- people --
L:  -- though.
R:  -- i- i- people want to fight everything -- anything that's gonna cost them a- and even a nickel.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If it's not going to benefit them, but it's going to benefit how our world is.
L:  Yeah, people don't realize that -- that, you know, the whole point of a democrac- of schools in a democracy is to have educated voters for the future to help run our country.
R:  Exactly, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- kids are our future, I mean --
L:  Uh, exactly --
R:  -- they are, your son is going to be whatever he wants to be, he could --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- be the next president United --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- States when he's forty --
L:  [LAUGH] You never know --
R:  -- fifty --
L:  -- exactly.
R:  -- you never know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, if he's not getting the proper education, then -- or the motivation, or the one on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one attention and then he gets frustrated --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, I mean, I'm ...
