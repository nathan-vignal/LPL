R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  H- hi!  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, another woman!  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  My name's Mary, what's yours?
R:  [MN]  Mary, my name is Lennie.  [NOISE]
L:  Lennie, okay.
R:  A- a- ah, the topic [SIGH] w- would you like to start?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't, um, [LIPSMACK] -- it's not one of my strong suits, US public schools.  I usually don't discuss that.  But if you would like to lead off?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, tell me this d- did you personally have children that went through the public school system?
R:  Mm, that's -- that's one of the reasons, I'm a single person.
L:  [MN]  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's basically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- myself and my experience and, ah, [SIGH] um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, brothers, sisters, cousins, whatever --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- friends and, ah -- a- of that ilk [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that have gone through the public school system.  U- u- um, I guess when they say public school system you're t- talking about up through high school not including college?  [SIGH]  So, in that respect, ah, I had a, um [SIGH] -- I had a good education.  I could have made a lot better of it -- it's, just, um -- it's a matter of how hard you want to work more than anything else, as in with anything in life.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  U- um, to me I don't, a- ah, if I'm gonna comment on the public school system nowadays, [SIGH] all I, ah, c- c- can comment on is what I see in the papers ... h- here and watch on television and radio.
L:  [MN]  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  As far as experience with other people, with let's say, nephews and nieces, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] nothing much in that respect.  [SIGH]  I mean they wen- -- some of them went to public schools, some of them went to private schools.  [SIGH]  So, ... [LIPSMACK] a- a- ah --
L:  Do you think there's an overall trend [SIGH] -- of it getting better or -- or worse or ...?
R:  [SIGH]  U- um [SIGH] if you h- hear the media in, a- again radio television and newspapers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, as far as we're always pouring money into the public school system [SIGH] and obviously never ever having enough money --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- no matter how much they pour in.  [SIGH]  Um, i- it -- it's -- it's a -- i- it's one thing ... as far as teachers with their unions [SIGH] and, ah, as far as the school itself.  Again, it all comes back to ... f- family values, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- parents, [SIGH] a- ah, how they teach their kids.  Whether they're emphasis is on education or, a- ah, other things.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How about you?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, [MN] it -- this is kind of a hard subject for me too.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I have five children --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [MN] and t- the oldest is twenty two and just graduated from college and my youngest is nine.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Okay.
L:  However we have home schooled all ours.  [MN]
R:  Home school?
L:  Yes, up until, um -- [MN] now my oldest two w- when they were, [SIGH] um, freshmen in high school then they went to public school.  [LIPSMACK]  So, they were home schooled t- through [SIGH] the eighth grade and [SIGH] were public schooled for the last, um, four years.  [MN]
R:  I see.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] now my next one -- no, is actually just finished his sophomore year [SIGH] but I have kept him home still.  [MN]  So, he's not going to on t- to the public school here.  [MN]  Um --
R:  "Here" meaning where?  [SIGH]  W- what part of the country are we talking?
L:  I mean Ohio.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, you're in Ohio?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  And we're in a rural setting, and I mean and it -- it's a nice high school --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, there's a- approximately four hundred children at the high school level.  [SIGH]
R:  That's a nice small school.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And I mean my oldest two did real well.  [MN]  Um, [MN] my daughter was valedictorian and my son was, like, third in his class, so they both did very well in the public school system after being home schooled.  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] now my next one, he's very intent on -- on being a -- a musician.  And [SIGH] our school system is so small, though, that we don't even have an orchestra and he plays violin.  [SIGH]  So, I have to drive him [MN] twenty five miles to a couple of different ... c- cities so that he has opportunity to play.  [SIGH]  So, that's part of the reason that I haven't kept him -- that I haven't sent him to public school [SIGH] is because, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they r- really don't have what his concentration is.  I have to take him [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he takes lessons privately from a college professor in the next town because [SIGH] we just don't have anything for him here.
R:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, in --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  So, in other words, a- ah, basically your -- you're right on top of the situation, I know --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- as far as with your kids.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Um, you know, that's -- that's good.
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]  I mean that's -- that's a family value right there.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Ah, it shows, [SIGH] a- ah, the kids -- a- ah, your kids, um, i- it shows that their parents are, um, [SIGH] ah, care about them and, a- a- ah, want them to succeed.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Ah --
L:  And I really didn't high school them because I had any bad experience.  [SIGH]  I did fine.  [SIGH]  But I overall --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- think that they've declined.  Ah, you know, and I'm not even worried about the academics as much as morally.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, teachers [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- are not given the power to discipline.  You know, I've heard kids talk back to ... t- teachers --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- like I would have never been permitted to.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Right.  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  So, I, ah, [SIGH] t- that bothers me more than anything -- is the, ah, t- the -- [MN] the lack of just common morals, like, just like the Ten Commandments.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They ... take that out now --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- -- to me they're -- it's so basic, how can you argue [LAUGH] with it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Or the -- or the, ah, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, the thing with the flag [SIGH] under God --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- and under that too.  Um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [SIGH] and who knows what -- what else they going to look for next --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as far as in the schools.  [SIGH]  So, I -- I can see that but [SIGH] it -- those are, like, u- um, [LIPSMACK] a- ah, shh -- shall we say sugar coated.  [SIGH]  I mean if you take that off it's basically the [SIGH] -- the academics more than anything, the concentration in, ah [SIGH] -- ah, the will to learn more than anything --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and the will to succeed.  I mean those are there, yes, those may be taken out but [SIGH] a- a- after that's passed over, basically, you know, you're, ah -- it's just like work.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You want to learn.  [SIGH]  You want to succeed.  You want to concentrate.  How bad do you want it?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] again that's ... based on how you've been raised [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- more than anything else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- a- ah, [SIGH] if you don't want it bad enough then you're, ah, -- basically just gonna [SIGH] take it day by day and, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, just go through the motions --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] until you, u- um, [MN] graduate from high school and then see where you go from there.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  A- ah ...
L:  The other thing I don't -- I -- that -- that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, [SIGH] in the public school now they do -- [SIGH] is your labelled --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so early if you have any kind -- if you're [LIPSMACK] well everybody --
R:  You mean special education?
L:  -- develops at different l- levels, you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, like, [SIGH] I have a child that was, ah, real slow --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] getting to learn -- I mean to read.
R:  [MN]  Right.
L:  She was real fast in everything else [SIGH] but reading was real delayed.  I know, as well as I'm sitting here, that if I'd have put her in a public --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- school [SIGH] she'd have been labelled as having a learning disability.  [SIGH]  And would've, you know, been --
R:  [SIGH]  Special led.
L:  -- yeah, put -- ah, not special led but probably just a learning disability because -- [SIGH] just because of reading.  [SIGH]  But, um, that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- label follows you forever [SIGH] and I just --
R:  [SIGH]  Well, y- yeah.
L:  -- didn't want that for her.
R:  I think I -- I had a niece who was similar to that, a- a- ah, when she -- she had home tutoring [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- to, ah, teach her how to read and everything.  And then, ah, you know, after that, ah, [SIGH] she went through the public school system and, basically, she was, ah, she graduated r- recently from -- well, last year from college.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And, ah, [SIGH] so she's, um -- she's okay now.  It's -- it's --
L:  Well that's a good success story right there.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, but, it -- it's j- just a matter of, ah, [SIGH] again having the parents, ah --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- seeing that and, [SIGH] ah, taking aim as far as how to correct that.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, that seems her parents must have --
R:  You know, some parents don't even --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- know how to do it.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Her parents must have cared enough to see that she got tutoring --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- to be caught up.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  And that's how s- s- she, ah, [SIGH] -- she was able to, um, [SIGH] get through school and go through college and, ah, you know, after that, ah, she on her, a- ah, she's in the work force now.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  So, I mean basically, ah, things like that, as far as, u- um, a- again going through US, a- ah, public schools [SIGH] you hear so much about it in the media every day [SIGH] as far as, ah -- ah, discipline problems or, ah, not having enough, um, [LIPSMACK] money for books [SIGH] a- ah, or -- or computers, things in that.  The basics are not there in some school districts.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But, um, you know, a- a- again, [SIGH] a- a- ah, i- i- if you have parents who, ah, or -- or not even parents but maybe, ah, relatives here and there who [SIGH] are going to care for them, [SIGH] a- a- ah, they will -- [SIGH] they should be, ah, able to do r- reasonably well.  I don't know h- how successful that's all a matter of interpretation more than anything else.
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Um, so you know, [LAUGH] that's -- that's basically it.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know I really can't add anything on to that, again, you know, I have to repeat myself with family values and, ah, [SIGH] a- ah, having the will to learn and instill that to them in -- in the beginning.  [SIGH]  And if you don't --
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] and I think that [SIGH] the other thing I -- I notice too is with, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, you know, they're making the criteria for teachers -- they're raising that all the time.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, you know, it's --
R:  More education you mean --
L:  Right.  Right --
R:  -- more degrees?
L:  -- no, teachers have to have more and more education and they themselves have to pass certain tests [SIGH] and all that.  So, I think they really are trying to raise [SIGH] the level of the teachers.
R:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
L:  You know, and, ah, and I mean that's -- that's a good thing.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  And then, of course, with that then they need a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, an increase in pay too.  I think around here [SIGH] your s- [LAUGH] starting salary for a starting teachers is, like, eighteen thousand a year --
R:  [SIGH]  Mm, I think it's a --
L:  -- you know.
R:  -- it's prob- -- probably double that in the -- in this area, in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the, ah, New York City, a- ah --
L:  Oh, [SIGH] okay.
R:  -- Long Island area.  Well, Long Island it -- it depends on what district your in but --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- in the, ah, [SIGH] New York City area it's, um, probably around -- well, obviously, you know, you talking about top of the line here in terms of, ah, [SIGH] of cost of living --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- over here.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] and I -- I do I think it's under twenty thousand around here, I really do, for a first year teacher out of [SIGH] -- straight out of college with no experience --
R:  [MN]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- so [SIGH] you know, things like that.  It's not too encouraging to go into the field either [LAUGH] --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, if you -- [SIGH] you just --
