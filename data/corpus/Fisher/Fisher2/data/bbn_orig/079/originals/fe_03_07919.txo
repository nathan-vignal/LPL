L:  -- million dollars.  Hello.  I'm Patty.  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  This is Elaine.
L:  Hey, Elaine.  How are ya?
R:  I'm doing great.  How about yourself?
L:  Ah, what state are you in?
R:  Texas.  
L:  Oh, you're kidding.  Oh, cool.  You're the first Texan I've talked to.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm r- -- I'm in Texas too.
R:  Oh, great.  What area?
L:  Ah, right now I'm out in Farning[?].  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Mesquite area.
R:  So -- what that's?
L:  Mesquite.
R:  Okay.  Uh, N- not far.  I'm in the Dallas area.
L:  Like where?  Like I am.  M- [MN] [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.
L:  What in heaven are I trying to think of.  Like around the Galleria or Preston area, or something?
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  How cool.  [LAUGH] Well, what do you think about what, uh --
R:  Now, what --
L:  -- a million bucks?
R:  -- was the to- -- w- I m- 'cause my husband grabbed the phone for me 'cause it was, um --
L:  You can tell him leave you alone.  All right.  If someone offered you a million dollars and the stipulation was you can never talk to your best friend again as long as you live, what would you do?  Take the million dollars and not talk to [LAUGH] your best friend again or [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  Okay, well, it's best friend not loved ones.  That's what I ...
L:  Right.  No, not loved ones.  You know, your best friend.
R:  Okay.
L:  Would you take the million bucks?
R:  No.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  I'd be j- --
L:  Well --
R:  I would greatly consider it though.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- finding it really [inaudible] --
R:  How about yourself?
L:  Well, I -- finding a really true friend, you know, someone whose y- really your best friend, you confide in and trust in and all, it's hard to find to begin with.  So, I [LAUGH] -- it depends I think on a [several inaudible words].  But, you know, it -- 
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- they, you know, how long you been friends and all but, no, I would -- if it was my truly best friend they'd -- we'd be friends.  Hell, I'd spend a million bucks too quick.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, you know, if they's just giving it to me, my best friend's for life.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, um, you know, and I -- I don't [MN] [MN] -- bear the thought of it they'd be talking, you know, best friend or is it my --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- husband or my best girlfriend --
L:  Oh.
L:  -- too.
L:  That's, uh -- that's, uh, oh.  That's pretty sneaky right there.  I didn't think about that.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause your husband's --
R:  But --
L:  -- your best friend.
R:  -- I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't take it either way because right now I have four children and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, the million dollars could do a l- uh, you know -- do a lot but, you know, I just kinda love my husband and he's pretty good to have around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then, you know --
L:  Well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- How long you been married to him?
R:  Uh, thirteen years.
L:  That's a longest time for a good buddy.  I -- in fact I'm with my ex husband right now.  See and we're been divorced for, how long?  Twenty years or fifteen years?  We're best friends.  I wouldn't take a million bucks for him.  That's my son's father and my best friend throughout the years.  You know, we finally get along and he's the sa- -- he's worth a million.  I- I'd have to tell them to keep it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I guess that, you know -- that he -- that [LAUGH] -- he's the one that did it.  But then again if it was some woman that, you know, was your best friend but only for, like, y- you moved somewhere new and, huh, you're best friends [MN] you're not sure about sometimes.  [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, if I was really broke and hurting and I had my children and needing money, um, actually I guess it would be a good friend.  I think -- I don't know if I took the million dollars and explain why, they would understand and want it.  I'm talking like pr- you know, where I'm totally broke, happen, you know, kids are hungry, living in a rat hole, then I would take the thou- the million bucks and explain to my best friend and tell her I love her and I hope you understand.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible]
R:  See, my -- my best friend --
L:  So, it's kind of --
R:  -- she --
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  -- she might kill me and so what good would, you know -- would [LAUGH] -- so, then what good --
L:  Well --
R:  -- would a million dollars be?  [LAUGH]
L:  If she was your really best friend and you really needed money, she would --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- she'd understand.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] You know.  So I -- I think it could go either way.  That's what I feel about it.  [LAUGH] [SIGH] You know.  That's my opinion and [PAUSE] like I said, it could go either way.
R:  Yeah, I guess it depends, uh, financially how, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything's still --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going.
L:  Right, right.  I think, yeah.  That's all I can -- that's all I can say on it.
R:  Um, now you say I'm the first one from Texas, have you done many of these calls?
L:  [NOISE] This -- you are my third one.
R:  Okay.
L:  How about you?
R:  I believe you're my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- third one as well.
L:  Yeah.  I have no idea what even happens when and, in fact, I think it's the third [NOISE] -- they pay us right?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Do you know how much or anything?
R:  Uh, I believe it's ten dollars.  
L:  That's what I was told.  I was [NOISE] make sure 'cause ten dollars from here on out each call, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, well, that'd help paying for the phone bill.  It will pay for it, won't it?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, cool.  Well, anyhow, I- [MN] how -- do they tell us when to quit talking or do we just quit talking?
R:  No, they -- it'll come on and give you a beep when you have like a minute left or --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- something like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ay.
L:  Oh, well.  Wonder if she cut it --
R:  And then -- and then it gives you at the end when it disconnects you and I, it gives you a chance if there's anything that you want to -- want to say.
L:  Oh.  See I've -- our conservations with the other people [NOISE] before we were cut off by them.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, well.
L:  I wonder if that -- I wonder if that'll affect me.
R:  Well, if you don't get a check in the mail then you know why.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
R:  You didn't talk your ten minutes
L:  [SIGH] That's true. 
R:  [MN]
L:  All right.  I'm actually I'm on a cell phone so, you know, sometimes I have to ignore it and not answer because the -- the time of day I [several inaudible words] charged for any phone call.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I was gonna say, yeah, my, um [LIPSMACK] I'm on a cell phone as well --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- just ...
L:  [NOISE] Is that what you're on now?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  That's all I have because, I mean, it's cheaper for me to use this then my home phone and have 'em both and I'm always with it so I -- it works good for me.
R:  Right.
L:  It does but it's like I said, sometimes when you're being charged those high dollar r- rates on it, you know, if you're in the day time hours and I've -- I've ignored several ph- [NOISE] --
R:  Okay --
L:  Not many more.
R:  -- so I was predicting that I hear [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay.  So this, we say goodbye.
R:  [NOISE] Not 'til it beeps and then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you get -- I believe you have to wait 'til, um, [MN] it goes all the way --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- all way through.
L:  Well, thanks.  I appreciate you telling me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And then, like I said, they give you, um, a chance, um --
L:  [MN] [NOISE] Okay.  [NOISE] Well, my friend just told me here.  Th- these people are going to call you and I didn't know nothing about it.  I've been going piecing it together.  [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And you gave me more of a lesson than she did.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN] Funny how -- I -- I'm still thinking though they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- offering us a million because [LAUGH] --
L:  Pardon?
R:  -- you know, as much as you think that you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- wouldn't do it, you just don't know 'til it's actually offered.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's true.  I think a million, that really is a lot of money, isn't it?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Boy, it's --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, could pay off a lot of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- bills and ...
L:  And you live comfortably for the rest of your life, hum?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, er, I mean, in reality, this is true.  [LAUGH]
R:  And you know, like, I have four --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- children and, um, put through --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- college.  [LAUGH] They're still is pretty young right now.
L:  Right, and right.  You know, my son's twenty one and [NOISE] basically I'm his home but --
R:  He's twenty one you said.
L:  Twenty one my son is.
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  He's -- that's my one and only.  That's my boy. He's [LAUGH] -- he's my best friend's actually too.  Um, you know, I could buy him -- him his dream home and buy my mom a dream home and [LAUGH] we could --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all live happily ever af- +after.  [LAUGH] [SIGH] It would be nice to have money I could do something like that for my family.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that would be kinda cool.
R:  Now, if it was a million dollars and you didn't have to speak to one of your family members, I'd do that one in a heartbeat.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hey, yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  I would too.
R:  Can I -- can I choose which family --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- member it is?  That would be a good question.
L:  [MN] Good, yeah, exactly.  Good.  That's good.  I like that.  [LAUGH] Yeah, I would tell them, "Yeah, okay, I won't ever talk to you".  Do me a favor and pay me to do it".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, goodness.  [LAUGH] Well, [NOISE] I mean, yeah -- I know I'm away on this -- I've been in a class.  I haven't been in school in years and so you called me in a [LAUGH] --

L:  I'm learning all about insurance.
R:  Oh, fine.
L:  Yeah, I -- oh, my goodness, I've [several inaudible words] [several inaudible words] but I'm sharing pretty good.  [LAUGH] It's just, you know, I -- I haven't been to school in years.  I'm talking twenty y- years like or more [LAUGH].  It's, you know -- but it's definitely different but I'm learning.
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  So, this has been a very, um [SIGH] [SIGH] busy week I sh- -- I should say and, um [LAUGH] I haven't been around a lot of people other than school so I'm sorry I talked your ear off and you caught [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH]
