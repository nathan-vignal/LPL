R:  And my name's Rhonda.
L:  Hi, how you doing Rhonda?
R:  I'm okay.
L:  Great.  So, what are we going to talk about, movies?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Yeah, that's what they said.  Okay, [MN] um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what was the last movie you saw?
R:  Um, I believe it was Darkness Falls.
L:  It was what, I'm sorry?
R:  Darkness Falls.
L:  Oh, was it good?
R:  Um, yeah, it's a scary movie.
L:  Ah, okay --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh my goodness, I love scary movies though.
R:  Well, that's a good scary movie.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, the last scary movie I saw, um, I rented it, ah, did you see The Ring?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you like it?
R:  Yeah, I liked it.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I loved it.  Well, maybe now, you know what we couldn't figure out?  We figured out why, ah, the video was made, because it was the little girl, she wanted to tell everybody, you know, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what happened, but why did they give everybody else a week, you know, and then they would die?
R:  Well, [NOISE] I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  That's what we were trying to figure.
R:  I think she was in the well seven days before she died.
L:  Oh, maybe that could be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it.  Okay, so, that was, like, seven days.
R:  Yeah, I think.
L:  But she was a vengeful little girl wasn't she?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  We usually rent our movies.  We don't hardly ever go to the theater and watch them.
L:  Yeah, because we've been doing the same thing too, right.  I like to go to the theaters, but my husband would just as soon stay home so, yep, that's just what we do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yep.  But they've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- been coming out with a lot of good ones lately, don't you think?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we got a satellite, so we watch a lot of the type of new mov- -- movies too.
L:  Oh, wow.  So, you must get everything.  See we don't have any system, you know, like that where we live.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  In Tennessee.
L:  [MN] Oh, okay.  I don't know if we're supposed to talk about other things or just movies.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the last lady I talked to, we talked about everything too [NOISE] [LAUGH] they --
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  -- [NOISE] 'cause we talked about our subject and we go okay, now what are we going to do for the [NOISE] rest of the time?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's what I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wondering.  Okay, because this is my first call, because the other day, um, when I, you know, um, wanted to know about the topic it said, ah, public schools and I didn't really know what to talk about the schools because my kids are all older, you know, they're out of school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  How many calls is this that you've made now?
R:  This is just my second one.
L:  Oh, this is just my first.

L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, we did it -- lady -- ah, the other day we sat around and just talked about everything, we --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [MN] we just [NOISE] after you've discussed it there's, you know, what else can you say about it.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know what this is true because we talk and we talked about that and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, okay, let me see.  Who's your favorite movie star?
R:  Oh, I don't know, I like a lot of different --
L:  I know, same here.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- people, it's hard to pick one.  I like -- I like -- Ben Affleck's [NOISE] real cute and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.  He's good --
R:  [NOISE] and --
L:  -- too, but I still like a lot of the old time ones.  I like Robert De Niro and, you know, the older ones like that too.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Exactly, exactly.  So you're a married lady?
R:  Yeah, I guess.
L:  You have children?
R:  Yeah, I got two boys.
L:  Oh, two boys.  I have three girls.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my sister has two boys and my --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- brother [NOISE] has two girls.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my god, god love them is all I can --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- say.  [LAUGH] No, 'cause I found it hard enough, you know, raising the three, never mind ten.
R:  There are two girls, not ten.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ah, no way, I mean.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness, I was gonna say.
R:  We'd all run from him if we seen him coming if he had ten, no way.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's what I thought you said, I was going to say, oh my goodness, exactly, exactly.  So is it real hot down there now?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  [NOISE] It's been -- the humidity's been real, real bad this week.  [NOISE]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the temperature is what?
R:  It's been [NOISE] -- ninety six is the temperature, but with the --
L:  Ah, oh, my god.
R:  -- humidity it's like a hundred and --
L:  Oh, wow.  [MN] Well, you know, I live in Massachusetts and, um, I would say about the middle of the week we had temperatures too, two days it was in the nineties and like you said, the humidity -- and it was just too much too soon because we're not used to that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.
R:  We stayed in the house about all week 'cause it was so hot you couldn't stand [NOISE] it. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well sure, you wouldn't have been able to go outside or anything.  My goodness, no.
R:  It rained about the whole month of May here.
L:  Wow, isn't that funny because we had the same.  We had cold and we had wet, so I guess it was just, you know, nationwide --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably.  Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.  Yeah.  So, do you have the same time as we do?  Bec-
R:  Yeah, I've got three -- three o nine or whatever [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- three o'clock -- around three o'clock.
L:  Okay.  So, it's -- you're around the same time zone then as we are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't realize that because I know so many other states are all different and everything.
R:  Yeah.  I believe every time you cross the continental --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- divide that it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- changes.
L:  Oh, okay.  Wherever that is, I don't know.  [LAUGH]

L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not too far away from here.

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Yeah, yeah.
R:  My sister lives in California and her --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she's got, like, about a four hour time difference between me and her and I'll call and say, "What time is it there?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I always catch her, like, in bed or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, exactly.  Because you just don't stop and think, you --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- know, whatever time it is.  No, [MN] now, I have a daughter who lives in California now.  Where does, ah, your sister live?

R:  -- you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- don't know exactly where all them places are, [NOISE] so. 
L:  Right, but I've heard of San Diego, of course, I think this is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, way past San Diego where she lives.  Yeah, but the climate is wonderful where she is, it doesn't get real hot or anything and it's just nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that it is.  So, I don't do too much on Sundays, how about you?  [LAUGH]

R:  Sundays is my husband's day to take care of the kids.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's my free day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I do it six days a week, he can do it one day a week.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You got that right, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause he usually works all the time [NOISE] so.
L:  Okay.  Yep, yep --
