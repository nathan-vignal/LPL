R:  Hi, my name is Lisa.
L:  Hi, my name's Christine.
R:  Hi, Christine, how are you this evening?
L:  [NOISE] How are you?
R:  I'm doing great.  Well, our topic is US schools and I guess what could be done to improve them.  Do you have children?
L:  Um, I have a stepson that's in public school.  My daughter is only three.
R:  Okay.
L:  And she definitely will not be going to public [LAUGH] schools.
R:  Yeah, I've -- I've had ups and downs with my kids in public schools.  I have got six children and I've got one left in public school.  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, over the years it's -- I've seen them go downhill.  Um, I used to live in California and, ah, left there about thirteen years ago.  And the town that we lived in, um, everything came home in, you know, English on one side, Spanish on the other, and, um, it was just really difficult because, um, the progress in the classroom was geared towards the kids who were learning the slowest.  So, well, my kids and, you know, other children that, you know, maybe were quick learners, um, were handicapped in that respect.  They got bored.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, ah, they couldn't got at their own pace.  Now, my two oldest children when they first started school we had them in a church school where they would do work books and go at their pace in each subject.  And they loved that because they could -- 'cause they could go as fast or as slow as they wanted and the class sizes were small enough where they had individual help from the teacher.  And it worked out really well but we then had to put 'em in public school because of cost [NOISE] so --
L:  Was it a Montessori school?
R:  Yeah.  Um, other --
L:  I would much prefer to put my daughter in one of those than -- than the public school.
R:  Right, now do they limit their class sizes generally?
L:  In the public school here?
R:  In the Montessori.
L:  I'm not sure.  Um, my sister put her daughter in it for a while.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And I think she had fifteen kids in her class.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  But my stepson is in the fifth grade and he had thirty kids in his class this year.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And --
R:  It's just -- you know, if they have one teacher and thirty kids, I mean they're lucky to keep law and order let alone try and teach 'em anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And 'course the state we live in now I know we're having budget problems and they've cut way back on, you know, the extracurricular activities, all the sporting, um, events that they used to have.  Um, I think the only thing left now is football and baseball and basketball.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  But just about everything else has gone.  I mean, we have no track program.  We have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no swim program.  Um, you know, it's just really sad.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think that sports are important because, you know, it gives kids the discipline that they need.
R:  Right.
L:  And to cut that out of the budget's kind of ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, it is.  And, ah, you know --
L:  Also keeps --
R:  -- the kids --
L:  -- them out of trouble. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH] Well, you know, they need time in the classroom to learn, but they also need to get outside and use some of that energy and -- and stay physically fit.  And, ah, you know, just be a well rounded individual.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, I don't know where our schools are headed.  Um, I know some of the schools where we live they do fundraisers to raise money to say, keep the [SIGH] pools open in the summer or pay for tournaments, you know, soccer tournaments or, um, your summer baseball tournaments, that kind of thing.  Um, you know, 'cause they have to pay the umpires and the referees and --
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know --
L:  I also don't agree with the field trips that my stepson went on.  Some of 'em were as expensive as, you know, fifteen dollars.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  This is --
R:  And [several inaudible words] you can get --
L:  -- public school.  It's supposed to be free, you know?
R:  Yeah, I know.  And 'course it starts [LAUGH] you know, from the day they -- they go to school.  When they get old enough they have to buy their locker, you know, um -- you know, any extra books they've got to pay for that.  You've got all your school supplies.  I mean, it just gets really, really expensive for the parents.  And, ah, 'course --
L:  I think that -- I think public schools should also enforce a uniform policy.
R:  Yes, I think so and, um, where I live some of the schools have gone to uniforms where they let the kids wear -- they get the choice of, like, khaki colored slacks or dark slacks and then they have three or four different polo shirts that they can wear.  And, you know, you can find those in a lot of different stores and they're not terribly expensive.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and then the kids go to school and they're ma- -- hopefully they're [LAUGH] thinking about learning rather than, you know, what the kid next to 'em is wearing.
L:  Right and then he comes --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- home saying, "How come I don't have this -- you know, my clothes aren't as good as theirs".
R:  Yeah, really.  Yeah, so also --
L:  I'm sure I'm going to hit that next year --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when he gets to middle school.
R:  Yes.  And, you know, that's when they really, um [LIPSMACK] are concerned about their appearance and how they look and, you know, "Is so and so going to like me you know 'cause I fixed my hair just so?" and [LAUGH] I mean, it's so -- it's kind of neat to see 'em go through that.  You know, they get their own style but yet they go to school, you know, worrying about their clothes and not worrying about the test they should be taking or, you know, their homework or [SIGH] --  I guess it kind of focuses their priorities if they've got uniforms on they're not worrying about that so --
L:  Right and they're not being teased for what they're wearing.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  'Cause I know my kids they come home and -- I had one that was always really upset, you know.  He -- he thought the others were picking on him and [SIGH] you know, it's just -- it was just something, you know, we had to deal with all the time.  'Course it wasn't only clothes, it was other things too that, um --  I guess if they're all wearing uniforms or similar clothes it's one less thing --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that they have to worry about and the parents have to [LAUGH] worry about.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I don't know [SIGH] you know, what to do about schools.  Um, I know we've got a lot of good teachers that are getting out of the profession just because, ah --
L:  Not paid enough.
R:  -- they're not -- they're not getting their raises.  Um, their hands are tied, you know, if -- if they try to discipline the kids then the parents get upset.  And, you know, if they don't show that their kids are learning by, you know, these Iowa tests or some of these other tests that the kids are given every year then, you know, the teachers, ah [LIPSMACK] I guess are not given promotions or whatever.  You know, if -- if it looks like the kids in their classes aren't learning anything.
L:  In -- in the state here the -- Virginia, we have, um, SOLs.  And once you get to middle school and high school, so I guess it goes from the eighth grade up, if you don't pass your SOL you don't pa- -- you don't graduate --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the twelfth grade.  That I don't agree with because there are some kids out there that are just not good at taking tests.  
R:  That's right --
L:  So I --
R:  -- and they need extra help.
L:  -- I definitely don't agree with that.  Right.
R:  I know --
L:  And it's --
R:  -- in the state I live in, I think the kids can only be held back one year out of twelve.  And there are --
L:  That is it?
R:  -- some kids who, you know, for whatever reason, maybe they've moved a lot, they've missed some -- some class time or, you know, maybe they just need extra help or whatever, um, they're not being held back and given the opportunity to relearn basic math or reading or whatever.  And so you have these kids graduating that, you know, they can't balance a check book and they can't fill out a job application.  And that's -- that's really sad.
L:  That is sad.  That is really sad.  My, um -- my son is -- when they took the SOL he is reading -- he's in the fifth grade and reading at a seventh grade level.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, they didn't have anything -- any program to put him in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so he had to read separate from everybody in the class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and take his tests on a computer, which I did not agree with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, that -- that kind of singled him out a little bit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, because they didn't -- they didn't have the advancement, you know, that -- that he needed in the classroom.  
R:  Right, a lot of --
L:  And I'm sure there are --
R:  -- the schools have done away with their, um [LIPSMACK] oh, I can't -- their gifted programs.
L:  Right.
R:  I had one son that I wanted him to tested, and they said, "Well, why do you want him to be tested?"  And I said, "Because he's bored in the class and he tells me he already knows all this material that you keep going over".  And they tested him and found out yes he was gifted but there was no money in the budget for students like him.
L:  And the kids --
R:  Well --
L:  -- that get bored tend to cause --
R:  Yeah, they get --
L:  -- a little bit of trouble.
R:  -- bored.  That's true, yeah.  Ah, and I guess, ah, I -- I had one friend tell me that, you know, the secret to keeping kids out of trouble is to keep 'em busy.  Well, you know, if they're bored with school they're not going to want to go.
L:  Right.  And if they don't have the, you know, +extracurricular -- extracurricular activities like the track and the soccer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, what's -- what's going to keep 'em from going with the wrong crowd and hanging out at the wrong places?
R:  That's true.  Especially when they get to that age where they're about fourteen, fifteen.  They can't drive yet and they're really almost too old to, like, be at a babysitters say after school or, um, during the summer if the parents have to work.  You know, what do you do with them? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Just, ah, I don't know -- it's just really hard to [SIGH] keep their lives busy where they, ah, you know, don't hang around with the wrong kids and --
L:  Right.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- We have, um --
