R:  Hello.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Alice.
L:  Hi, Alice.  This is Kerry.
R:  A- I'm -- live in North Florida.
L:  In North Florida.  I'm out in Colorado.
R:  Oh, a long way off.  [LAUGH] Uh, what are your school systems out there?
L:  Um, I'm not real familiar with the school systems out here actually because I taught in, um, private school out here.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh.
L:  And my children are too young for -- for school.  I went to public school myself in Florida and I taught in public school in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, okay.  You- you've been around then.  [LAUGH] I'm from North Carolina.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, our schools in Florida are hurting.  Uh, not enough money this year for summer school, so that [SIGH] hurt the students who were not going to pass, so there's a mammoth amount that failed.  We have a lot of private schools in this area [LIPSMACK] because our schools -- our county school systems are so [SIGH] -- I hate to use the word "bad" but that's about it.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I think the biggest problem though really with -- with the schools is parent involvement.
R:  Mhm.
L:  More than anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's why so many private schools do so well is because the parents are very involved.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LIPSMACK] We're, um, er, in fact one -- my son in law and daughter, who live here right next to us or near us, we're way out in the country, but she drives a hundred miles round trip to take the kids to school every day.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Has to go into another county.  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- i- it -- it takes a lot of time.  Thank goodness she's a stay at home mother.  She's trying to get a job at the school.  Um ...
L:  So, is it a private school --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- she drives ...?
R:  No, it's, um, connected with the University of Florida.  It's their training school.  It's that [inaudible] training school.  And they do a lot of, uh -- you have to sign a paper to begin with that you're -- that they can [MN] [MN] do, uh, [LIPSMACK] innovative ideas on your child.  You know, w- in teaching your child which --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, so far there's been no problem with it though.  But, uh, this is their third year there and the children love it other that that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- long ride and the fact that if there's a birthday party, you don't go.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're too far away.  But, uh, like she says, "You do what you have to do for your children".  Our private schools here are, um, [SIGH] well over five thousand a year plus, um, books and, uh, no food.  I mean, you have to bring your own food so -- and buses are just ridiculously priced so -- because this is a rural area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that has kept a lot of people from sending their children to private schools.
L:  Well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what are they doing about the public schools then?
R:  Um, not one thing.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  We, uh -- we see a lack of discipline in them.  Um, Florida hurt themselves badly when -- and I was one of the ones that voted for, uh, the lottery because it was to help the schools.  But instead what happened the state cut the budget for the schools.
L:  Right, yeah, I remember being there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And Georgia watched that model and they reworded it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so that it wouldn't cut the schools.
R:  Wouldn't cut the schools.  And it --
L:  'Cause I also lived in Georgia.
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  And I did student teaching.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  In Georgia.  [SIGH]  
R:  In Georgia.  
L:  And my -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and my sister.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My -- two of my sisters have graduated --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- from public high school --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- in Georgia.  [LIPSMACK] And -- well, I'm sorry, one of them graduated from private.  They both went to public schools in Georgia though --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at different times.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Um, but I think that helped them out a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- too is the way they did the funding.
R:  Well, now which --
L:  I think one of --
R:  Which state schools did you find --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were the best?
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  That you dealt with?
L:  [NOISE] With -- [NOISE] I don't think it's necessarily by state.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it -- it's different schools.  And I think the best ones are the ones where the parents are most involved.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Um, I also think [SIGH] -- you know, it's hard.  I know, from being a teacher, it's hard to get some parents involved.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I wouldn't say that the parents don't care about what happens to their kids but [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, there's parents that are, you know -- both parents are working.  One of them's working two jobs or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- three jobs just --
R:  And so they can't.
L:  -- to make ends meet.
R:  They can't be there.
L:  So, they can't be there.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it really affects the kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Well, I am just very thankful my children are all grown.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's grandchildren make it even worse.  You know, because you do [COUGH] -- I find myself more concerned with them then I was with my own children.  Um, with the lack of education that they're getting in some cases.  Others -- um, a couple of 'em, e- er, it wouldn't matter what school's like, they're still gonna get a good education but I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're just hurting money wise here in the state of Florida for it.  A -- well, I guess, it's nationwide, from what we're hearing but ...
L:  It -- it is nationwide, I think.  Um, but I don't think [MN] -- see I don't think necessarily that money is always the answer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, because you can look at schools that have lots of money and that still --
R:  Yeah, aren't --
L:  -- aren't providing what the kids really need.
R:  Uh-uh.  Mm mm.  But ...
L:  So, and I think that's what you're gotta figure out is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the other problem I -- I -- I remember some people talking about in Georgia when I was student teaching and comparing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, there were several of us, um -- I was taking a class and we were all teaching a different school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they said one of the problems was [NOISE] that the county looked at what was working in one school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in a more affluent area and then telling the people in the poorer areas they should be doing the same thing with their kids.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because it was doing a good job up there.
R:  Right, and -- and that doesn't work.  
L:  A- --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I think when we try to create a mould that this is what public schools should be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we create more problems.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But you really have to let --
R:  Well, now, will you --
L:  -- individual [inaudible] ...
R:  -- send your children to private or public or ...?
L:  It would really depend where I was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would certainly check out the schools carefully [SIGH] before I decided.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, in an area like we're in right now, I might send 'em to private.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just because I -- well, I taught in a Catholic school here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I would love to have my children in a Catholic school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But money's also an issue.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's -- that -- that's the thing is, are you willing to really sacrifice in order to do it?  Or is it necessary to sacrifice?  Um ...
L:  And that's -- they, uh -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that's the thing.
R:  It should be the state's responsibility, I realize, to educate our children but it isn't happening.
L:  I don't think it's even the state's responsibility, honestly.  I think it's the parent's responsibility.
R:  Well, th- the parents to see that they're getting the right kind but the money's supposed to be coming from the state.  That's what we're paying our taxes for.  [LAUGH] Among other things.
L:  Among other things, [LAUGH] yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ...  But, uh, [LIPSMACK] we're -- we're very happy with the, uh -- some of the counties around here, [MN] -- around us, in North Florida, are excellent.  Have good ratings and at the public schools.  And, uh, we happen to be in a county that's very transit.  And, uh, so therefore we do have a little bit of a [LIPSMACK] problem with that but [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Well, that makes it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- very difficult for teachers too.
R:  Yes, we lose our teachers just -- I mean, in fact, Georgia is getting a lot of our teachers.  They're now paying a higher salary then, uh, Florida so a lot of ours and of course, we're -- our county is, er, joins Georgia so, you know, it isn't any handicap for them to drive there.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And that -- that's happening.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Yeah, see we -- actually in North Carolina, it was the opposite.  South Carolina was paying better.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I wasn't that close to the -- to the state line that I would've gone over --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they said in -- like in Ch- -- I mean, even in Charlotte.  I was north of Charlotte.
R:  Oh.
L:  But even in Charlotte, people were going down to South Carolina.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, when I was in College, the place to go in North Carolina to teach was Charlotte because they had so much higher salary in Charlotte.  I grew up in the mountains and, uh, stayed in the mountains to teach.  [inaudible] because that was the part of the state I liked I guess.
L:  Yeah, well I think --
R:  But, uh ...
L:  -- really anywhere you can get -- anywhere you can get the parents in.
R:  [MN]
L:  And sometimes that's especially hard in high school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause the kids tell 'em to leave.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] [COUGH].  I taught many years in high school but I don't know that I could do it now.  So, when I did substituting then I stayed in the elementary grades and which I loved.  [LIPSMACK] But, uh ...
L:  Yeah, yeah, across the border elementary schools seem to have fewer problems.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because their parents are there more.  [SIGH]
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And that I think is the key right there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's jus -- you gotta get parents to stay involved in their --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kid's education.
R:  I'm having a hard time hearing you.
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  So, okay, it's all right.
L:  And so we just have to keep parents involved in their children's --
R:  [MN] Yes.
L:  -- education.
R:  And it's got to be more than just the PTA.
L:  Yes.
R:  Er, because that just becomes a social club [NOISE] er, very often.
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  They need to be willing to -- to sit down and work with their kids and, you know, maybe some of our -- I know some schools have tried, you know, like community nights.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where they bring the parents in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And have activities and -- and things like that.
R:  [NOISE] Our large --
L:  Yeah, I don't if more of that would help.
R:  Well, our large elementary school here.  [COUGH] One of the [NOISE] first w- uh [MN] [MN] fir- -- with the first PTA meeting, they invited all the parents for spaghetti supper.  And, uh, I went with my daughter and her family and --
