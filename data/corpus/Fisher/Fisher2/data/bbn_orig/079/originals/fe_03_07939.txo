L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, I'm Lisa.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name is Mike.
R:  Hi, Mike.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, [SIGH] and we're talking about public schools?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yes.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I, um, I definitely think there's a lot wrong with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- public schools.  [SIGH]  Ah, now just to begin with --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have no children.  [SIGH]  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just me and the wife --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] but as far as I'm concerned I see how the kids act and react.  [SIGH]  Um, my biggest --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- problem is that they don't react.  [SIGH]  You -- you just say hello to 'em [SIGH] and anything or any kind of a comment like that, and they just look at you, like -- [SIGH] like you're a statue.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  Like, you don't even exist.  [SIGH]  And I think all this is got to start with, th- -- ah, teaching our kids in school, [SIGH] um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] there's definitely a big problem --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and l- living here in Arizona, [SIGH] ah, we have a lot of c- children that can't read, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can't write.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  You have a lot of n- native Americans still in A- Arizona too, right.  [NOISE]
L:  That's very true.  We are h- heavily populated, ah, with Hispanic [SIGH] but still [NOISE] there's just -- there's still -- still no excuse.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I myself, ah, am a -- am a minority [SIGH] and I didn't use that as an excuse not to go to school [SIGH] but t- they're --
R:  No, really --
L:  -- doing that -- they're doing that -- I'm sorry to in- interrupt you but I'm sa- -- but that's what they're doing nowadays.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Well, I'm in Florida [MN] and we probably have o- one of the worst school systems here.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And they -- they've caught -- they've started this thing called FCAT[?] [SIGH] where these kids are being tested at different ... age levels [SIGH] and what they're testing them on is math and English.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  They have ... discontinued everything else in the middle schools, or in the elementary schools.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  All they're teaching them is math and English.  There's no social studies, there's no science, there's no history --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] these kids are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the only history lesson they get is every February when it's the Martin Luther King --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- Black History month.  [SIGH]  And I'm native American.  My children are both out of school now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have a twenty one year old and an eighteen year old [SIGH] they're both out of school, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they never learned anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about their heritage --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] because they didn't get into the history [SIGH] but they can name anything about black history that they want.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's -- that's very interesting you brought up that Martin Luther King.  [SIGH]  Um, living here I'm not sure if you know h- how the voting here -- is here in Arizona?  [SIGH]  I'm going off the subject just a little bit and I'll tell you why.  [SIGH]  We got that Martin Luther King t- thing shoved down our throat.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  We had [NOISE] to vote, yes, otherwise [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the federal government [SIGH] as well as state government [SIGH] was going to withhold funds, including for our schools, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as well as for highways and other things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] which I thought was totally --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- incorrect.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  But we were held hostage here in Arizona.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, the -- they're -- that's what they doing and the thing is with here [SIGH] is with this FCAT thing [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that these teachers are [SIGH] -- they're grading the schools and they're giving the schools money.
L:  Yes.
R:  [SIGH]  It's not money to put towards anything on education though it's to better the school, like, [SIGH] put up a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, most of the elementary schools have done a put up, like, um, [SIGH] a, um, sun screen thing, a big roof over a play area outside --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so the kids have a shade.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, when you live in ... Orlando [SIGH] it's very hot --
L:  I hear you.
R:  -- but [MN] to me I would think that they should take that money that the schools get [SIGH] and in- invest it into more computers or books or something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] to, you know, give these kids.  Now I know that some of the elementary schools what they've done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] is they actually [SIGH] when the book fairs came in they -- they spent five dollars on every kid --
L:  [MN]  Ah --
R:  -- if it was an A rated school.
L:  -- [NOISE] you mentioned something about the ... computers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [SIGH]  I, um, I dislike computers.  I really do.  [SIGH]  I like --
R:  Really?
L:  -- to see a -- you know what I'd like to see?  [SIGH]  I'd like to see our schools go back to pencil, [SIGH] pen and paper.
R:  See I'm a former computer teacher.  Ah --
L:  -- [LAUGH] and I -- and --
R:  I was teaching high schools.
L:  -- I tell you what when you -- when you see these -- these young children they're -- they're take the, ah, [SIGH] -- ah, the jobs as a waiter, waitress or [SIGH] fast food --
R:  Uh-hum, they don't --
L:  -- they -- they can't --
R:  -- know how to add.
L:  -- exactly, they can't count.  [SIGH]  Ah, if they didn't have their fingers on firm I think they'd be lost.
R:  [SIGH]  Well you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- what, honestly, that even came from my generation.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I mean I graduated in nineteen eighty [SIGH] and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the kids that, I mean, I was going to school with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they couldn't add either --
L:  Exactly.
R:  --without a calculator, because they started permitting us to use calculators in school.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  You know, a- a- ah, I don't think that the computers are en- -- a- are, ah, bringing 'em down.  And computers -- well, when I seen I was in [SIGH] -- where I taught was a disadvantaged school.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  These kids [SIGH] either they went to the school or they were on duty.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, it was their last chance, they were going to jail or be in school.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  And a bunch of these kids, [SIGH] if it wasn't for the computers they would've never learned.
L:  [SIGH]  That's possible, yeah.
R:  I mean I -- I saw a great improvement when I started teaching them how to use these lap top computers.  [SIGH]  Ah, in- instantly I saw such an improvement with them.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They were -- they were kids that, um, it felt like they were outcast.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I -- I -- all in all, though, the public school system stinks!
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, I think in Ariz- -- we have a problem here in Arizona [SIGH] where a lot of our children going to school with ... guns --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and weapons.  [MN]  That just --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- b- blows me away altogether.  [SIGH]
R:  My -- my son -- I pulled my son out of the high school that -- where we lived at, [SIGH] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my daughter had been pulled out of there when she was in her second year there because she got +death threats.  She was a cheerleader, honor student, everything.  [SIGH]  I ended up pulling her out but too late she ended up dropping out of school.  [SIGH]  My son's the same way.  [SIGH]  The school that he went to was ninety eight percent black [SIGH] the drugs [SIGH] and the -- the guns, the weapons.  [SIGH]  He said, "Well, they actually didn't have guns" he said but every single person had a k- knife or [SIGH] -- or packing something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  I mean even the teachers have guns on them or mace.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Yeah, another interesting point you brought up, [SIGH] ah, about the school percentage being minority.  [SIGH]  Um, I graduated back in seventy two.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Ah, I went to a school where ninety nine [SIGH] point eight percent was white.  [SIGH]  I was t- [LAUGH] there.  I think out of six thousand students in the school I was the only minority.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Ah, c- e- excuse my language [SIGH] but I was the b- black sheep [LAUGH] of the school.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And I knew what it was like to get beat up at school and all this kind of stuff, [SIGH] but the point I'm getting at [SIGH] is I personally did not let that hinder me [SIGH] --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- from getting my education --
R:  Well, you see it means --
L:  -- I personally -- I personally think that's a cop out.  I really do.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, see myself -- even myself a- and both my children, [SIGH] being that we were American Indian, and they're -- they're more American Indian than me 'cause their father was also American Indian [SIGH] and we -- but we get mistaken as being Hispanic, --
L:  True.
R:  -- because of the dark complexion and the dark hair and everything.  [SIGH]  And so we were treated too, um, a little bit of outcast, but we overcome, [SIGH] you know.  I -- I graduated, [SIGH] um, six hundred and [SIGH] -- s- six hundred and fifty students in my class [SIGH] and I was, like, t- three hundred and twenty four --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- in the class standings.  [SIGH]  So, I mean I still -- I wasn't t- the best but I was ... average.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]  The other --
R:  But, um, -- but I had to overcome that too 'cause I had a lot -- and especially when the fact is [SIGH] that your mother, who you get the Indian blood from, is blond haired and green eyed.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Everybody thought I was [LAUGH] a- adopted or something.
L:  I don't know if you noticed this problem or not?  I don't know if it's a problem or not.  [SIGH]  Um, I have a lot of school buses t- that empty out in the area where I live at --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] I'd say p- probably close to ninety percent of 'em [SIGH] never have any books in their hand.
R:  Oh, no.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  What happened to homework?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Whatever happened to bringing books home [SIGH] and spending the first hour or two at home and getting your [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your lessons taken care of and then [SIGH] go out and -- and participate in [SIGH] your local neighborhood activities?
R:  Well, in all honesty [SIGH] most of the schools are so poor that they only have [SIGH] a set of books for the classrooms.
L:  Well, the community I'm in -- I'm here in Tampa, Arizona, [SIGH] ah, and we're -- we're not poor, we're just -- this is a good -- a- ah, c- city.  [SIGH]  Ah, we, ah, we have a lot of new things that are being created --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all the time, [SIGH] and they're always asking for -- for raises for school.  [SIGH]  It seems like every third or fourth month --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're going to the ballots, [SIGH] ah, to r- raise the bond issue for more money.  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  But if you actually w- went into your schools you -- and you found out [SIGH] you probably would find out that all they have is a set of books for each classroom.
L:  Oh, that -- that --
R:  That these kids are not even issued books.
L:  -- that would -- that -- that's -- that's -- that's insane.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [LAUGH]  Tot- -- that's totally insane.
R:  And the only reason that they -- [SIGH] the only reason and -- 'cause I -- I see this here in Orlando --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and the only way that the kids can get the books [SIGH] is that they have to check them out.  They have to go back to -- to the classroom [SIGH] after school, check out the books.  Well, the kids that are riding buses, the buses are leaving really quick.
L:  True, --
R:  [MN]  Now --
L:  -- you have a schedule to meet.
R:  -- my son just spent two years [SIGH] at the number one Florida school [MN] but he's lost, [SIGH] you know, he's totally lost.  [SIGH]  This school [SIGH] they have classroom books and they issue every single kid a book and they keep them at home.  [SIGH]  They don't bring 'em back to school.  They're to stay at home so that they [SIGH] have their books at home every night when they need 'em.
L:  That's good.  I go with that.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  But this was in -- this is the number one school, -- ah, high school in Florida.
L:  Wow!
R:  They have money.  [LAUGH]
L:  But that blows me away.  I don't see any of these, ah, young middle or older children with any books at all.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  So, either they [SIGH] have been issued books on the first day of school to stay at home, [SIGH] or they're only got classroom books.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, there's one other thing that bothers me about the school system --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I think the most -- biggest complaint we hear about is the l- lunch.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  They get twenty minutes --
L:  What kind -- what kind of food they're --
