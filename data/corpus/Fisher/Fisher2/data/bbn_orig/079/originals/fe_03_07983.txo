L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Another woman. [NOISE]
L:  Yes.
R:  [SIGH] This is --
L:  [LAUGH] Did you have a woman before?
R:  And --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a woman before that.
L:  Oh, wow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so this is your third time?
R:  Three is the max, I think, uh, for --
L:  Um --
R:  -- com- competing in -- well, not competing, but participating in this particular, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- project.
L:  -- cool.
R:  Yeah, I don't know, uh, is this your first?
L:  Uh, second.
R:  And you had a woman before?
L:  Yes, I did. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know what this --
L:  I see more women participating than men.
R:  Yes, I -- I -- and I'm reading the ad right here and it says, "Men, um, men calling" -- well, I don't know about your, uh, particular ad or how you participated, but, [LIPSMACK] uh, according to this one it was saying, um, [LIPSMACK] that you have to be a man, "needs male participants", and "will take part talking ten to ten minutes to other participants on suggested topics", so, based on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that particular --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sentence I thought it was going to be, uh, another man.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But this is my, uh, third and last time or at least according to this --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't about your, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, [COUGH] your particular project or, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, ad that you answered.
L:  Yeah, I think it's three times, too, but I've got one more time.  They haven't been able to catch me, I've been a gone for about a week, though, too.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I was hoping that they wouldn't just give up. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, no, I, um, I planned it like this, three days in a row, just to get this fast out of the way --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, had one Thursday, had one Friday and today would be the last one that I'm --
L:  Okay --
R:  -- calling.
L:  -- now, um, affirmative action, gimme your definition?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I think I --
R:  I was just --
L:  -- know, but I'm --
R:  -- gonna ask you that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, based on -- [LIPSMACK] it's hard for me to even define that.  Uh, based on race, gender, or, uh, you could put other areas where diversity is created in the workforce, or --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in the academic field.
L:  Okay.
R:  Or just in any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- field in particular and that may --
L:  In -- in the hiring process, they said.
R:  Well, this is what they want, they're concerned about the hiring process --
L:  Right --
R:  -- and, according --
L:  -- right.
R:  -- to this week, uh, you've heard about the, um, University of Michigan, uh, situation, have you not?
L:  No, I was gone --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- all week, I didn't hear or see much news.
R:  Yeah, well, they, um, the Supreme Court ruled this week on, uh, on, uh, affirmative action as far as, um, uh, in academics, not in no hiring background --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- uh, hiring workforce --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, they were saying, like, uh, the undergraduate they can continue the, uh, affirmative action, uh, situation where, um, they want diversity, but yet in the college, uh, graduate division, especially, like, the law school, they're going to narrow that down as far as, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, affirmative action where it's not so much on diversity, but more on merit, at least what I think -- how I interpret it.
L:  Mm-kay.
R:  So, [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as in --
L:  Well, I think the merit's good. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, yeah, [LAUGH] I think --
L:  I mean especially --
R:  -- most people --
L:  -- in education.
R:  -- would agree that it is good, but, um, i- if that was -- if that was the case based on strictly merit, affirmative action wouldn't even be in your vocabulary.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.
R:  Would you agree with that?
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.
R:  Uh, so, if --
L:  Because there wouldn't be any need for it.
R:  Right, there wouldn't be any need for it and yet, you know, the assumption is that it would be a particularly white male dominated world --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  -- in the hiring workforce.
L:  That's right.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if it wa- and, you know, according -- according to how I interpret it as far as reading, wri- um, hearing a- and reading newspapers, I think it has helped not so much with the general, [LIPSMACK] uh, stereotype or opinion is that it helps blacks and Hispanics, but the real, uh, winner in this has been white females.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh --
L:  And especially black females.
R:  Okay.  Um, [MN] generally I would think, uh, I -- I've been hearing about white females and -- but if the black females have been participating and a- and have been real, like, the winner, uh, [COUGH] I guess that's, uh, [MN] a go- a good thing for them, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as long as they -- they -- they just can't go in cold, I mean obviously they have to have some qualifications to it and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from then on they -- they really, if they're, uh, [COUGH] so called compared with, uh, a white male or, but whatever, you know, they're going to give -- get the chance --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on this.
L:  Right [NOISE] --
R:  -- uh --
L:  -- and they should, I mean --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, we need to get to some equality here --
R:  Uh, yeah.
L:  -- not that I, you know, I don't always agree that equal pay for equal, but equal work done necessarily, 'cause I know that there's a lot of m- men breadwinners, but now, you know, it's a lot of women that are older, too and so --
R:  And a lot more divorce, supposedly --
L:  Right --
R:  -- when you hear --
L:  -- and they --
R:  -- about that.
L:  -- have to try to, [SIGH] uh, raise their children and sometimes they're the breadwinners. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, I suppose they're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then where you would think that, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you didn't hear so much about divorce because, uh, it was a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- white male dominated world --
L:  Right.
R:  -- before affirmative action --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- as a result, you know, women couldn't really divorce.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because they --
L:  Right --
R:  -- really didn't --
L:  -- because they --
R:  -- have any --
L:  -- wouldn't have a chance. [NOISE]
R:  Right, they wouldn't have the chance --
L:  [NOISE] Everybody'd be on welfare. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah, well, [LIPSMACK] uh, or d- I -- a- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even the world wasn't that expensive as it is today, or --
L:  True.
R:  -- even the, like, last twenty years, it seems, uh, since in the around the nineteen eighties, uh, the world has gotten a lot more expensive.
L:  I believe that, too.
R:  Yeah, I mean if you compare things in the nineteen seventies, or even before that, I guess they were reasonable, but, you know, you can even look at the cost of real estate in itself, buying a house, buying an apartment, it's just, uh, through the roof --
L:  Right.
R:  -- through the roof and not to mention all the, uh, the -- the taxes that go with that.
L:  Yeah and especially in the last five or ten years it seems like it's really, really been bad.
R:  Yeah, and they call the, uh, the nineteen eighties the decade of decadence, uh, meaning --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that everything was so expensive, uh, uh, primarily but even the nineties has gotten, uh, probably ten times worse.
L:  Oh, I think so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I definitely think so, I think the -- the younger the kids, seems like the more -- the each generation just seems to tend to have the more wants and [LAUGH] you know, and so it's pushing it -- the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- prices up.
R:  -- well, I hear kids in the background, so, I mean, I know in your situation, if it's your kids, you probably can feel it with toys et -- et cetera.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Huh, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- and the push as far as every -- every Christmas, but I guess we're getting off the topic, now, a little --
L:  Well, yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] But as far as, uh, affirmative action, hiring workplace, yes, I guess it's -- it's okay, but then again the government is, um, the government, uh, is so much involved in this, uh, that, uh, any time there is not that quota met as far as big corporations, um, they're going to get hit with fines.
L:  Oh, yeah, they get penalized and fines, that's right, that's for sure --
R:  And, you know, it's --
L:  -- I mean this is kinda good --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- that they -- they're --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- in there on some aspects, because, um --
R:  As a watchdog, yeah.
L:  -- yes, because I mean it -- [MN] you need to have the help and everything and, um, be able to have everybody to have some kind of chance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make it in the world, besides, like you said, just the white males --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- so, um --
R:  And, uh, obviously from that point of view the, yeah, as long as, uh, once they're in and they're able to put up with the, uh, [LIPSMACK] the politics ever- everyday, uh, work over there, um, perhaps they'll get into more, um, managerial positions and, uh, able to dictate, you know, as far as in -- in upper management and as a result, um, able to hire, I guess, more -- more diverse areas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a- you know --
L:  -- well, it seems --
R:  -- and it's --
L:  -- like the females are definitely getting into politics --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- more.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, yeah, yeah --
L:  They're, you know, you -- more and more women are -- are getting, uh, nominated for -- for different, uh, levels of areas.  I [inaudible] I don't know how soon it'll be for president, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Hm, mm.
L:  -- I don't know that I really care to have a female as a president, but, uh --
R:  Well, i- it's surprising, um, given what happened yesterday, and I was reading the news about, um, the death of, uh, [LIPSMACK] Margaret Thatcher's husband, [NOISE] I don't know, you -- you do know who Margaret Thatcher is?
L:  Yes --
R:  She was --
L:  -- I do.
R:  -- the, uh, prime, uh --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- minister --
L:  -- prime minister.
R:  -- of Britain --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, you know, you know, the reason I bring that up was because of -- of her being the first woman as for prime minister and of Britain, [LIPSMACK] uh, and, you know, obviously in here, in America, uh, I don't know if, whether you're gonna ever see that in your lifetime, or my lifetime --
L:  Right --
R:  -- as far as --
L:  -- I'm not sure about that either, I don't -- I don't know, though, it seems like it's getting closer as far as people running for it, but, um, I'm not sure, 'cause I know that they haven't made it to vice president yet. [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, yeah.
L:  Senators are about the highest spots right now.
R:  Yeah, I guess, uh, as time --
L:  Oh, no --
R:  -- goes by.
L:  -- governors, there are women governors --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- that's right.
R:  -- there -- there -- there have been, um, ma- well, not many, but there have been, uh, a number of them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a number of them, so, [LIPSMACK] uh, again, it's just matter of time before, um, [COUGH] one -- one is, uh, at least nominated and competing, uh, uh, for a nomi- for the president more than anything else, um, who knows?  Who knows?  It's just, um, again whether I'm going to see it in my lifetime or whether you're going to see it in your lifetime.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, on that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] uh, I don't know how much more --
L:  Being here from Chicago area, I know that Carol Moseley Braun has -- has really thought about it.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah --
R:  She --
L:  -- but -- 
R:  -- she is a black female, right?
L:  Mhm.  That was, uh, senator?  Senator, the --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- other state representative.
R:  Yeah, she was in some kinda -- yeah, I've heard her name many times.
L:  Right, um --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- but I don't -- I don't care for her that well.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've heard, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- yes, kind of being too on the liberal side.
L:  Yes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm not -- I'm [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- not as liberal as she is ...
