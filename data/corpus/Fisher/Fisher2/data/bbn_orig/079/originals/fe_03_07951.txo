L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Hi!  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name is Susan.  I live outside [NOISE] of Atlanta.
R:  [COUGH]  Really, I'm [COUGH] my name is Richard.  I'm in Seattle.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I thought I noticed a southern accent.  [SIGH]
L:  O- oh!  I still think I don't have one.  [MN]
R:  You do.
L:  You know, everybody else tells me differently.  And, well, they're from Maine and they just sit around and laugh at me about that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you do have one.
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Do you have kids in school?  Mine are grown.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, I have a two year [NOISE] old and a five year old which -- I'm --
R:  O- oh!
L:  -- home schooling the five year old.
R:  [SIGH]  Really?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, um, [SIGH] my -- and I have three older step children that are fifteen, nineteen and twenty one and they all went through the public school system.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, [NOISE] [MN] -- now the reason I home school is because [NOISE] -- now, [NOISE] I, you know, hav- -- I just know the Georgia school system --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I can't -- I don't know, you know, the rest of the country.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But [NOISE] ... they won't test her for ... a higher grade.  [NOISE]
R:  O- oh!
L:  And even at five she's reading probably in the second and third grade lev- -- reading level.  [SIGH]
R:  Good.
L:  And I don't want to s- send her to kindergarten in the fall [NOISE] [SIGH] and learn her letters all over again.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I know.  [SIGH]
L:  So, um, I -- I -- that's my big gripe [NOISE] is that they won't t- test [SIGH] for [NOISE] [SIGH] -- at least in kindergarten and first grade around in here they won't.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  But ... possibly in the higher grades.  I know when [NOISE] they get to middle school and high school they'll put 'em in accelerated classes.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Okay.
L:  But I'm not going to bore her for six years.  [LAUGH]
R:  N- no.
L:  [SIGH]  Until she gets to middle school.
R:  [SIGH]  Ah, wow --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have a -- a friend wh- [SIGH] -- she and her husband h- home schooled e- every one of their s- seven children.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Ah, this is a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- off t- the t- topic, I know, but [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] doesn't it take a lot of [SIGH] self discipline and a lot of discipline with the home schooling system?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it does.  [LAUGH]
R:  I would think.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, no, fortunately, at least in Georgia, we don't have any reporting requirements to the [NOISE] state [SIGH] ... or country --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- until she turns six and w- when she would go to first grade.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Okay.
L:  So, wel have a lot more leeway at this point.  Mm  --  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I had a friend who taught at a -- like a Montessori school --
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] and he said what was [SIGH] s- sad is, um, [SIGH] -- because it -- they only went to a certain grade, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, I don't know, third grade or fourth grade.  [SIGH]  And he said when they went to, [SIGH] um, -- because they were, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really, [SIGH] challenged and encouraged --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] it was a very progressive s- school.
L:  Right.  [MN]
R:  And very, very progressive and he said when they went back [SIGH] to -- if they went back to public school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] a lot of times, like you were saying, [SIGH] they had already c- covered this material --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so they were, like, [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- b- bored, [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and they had covered the m- material that these s- students were just now covering.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  And he said it was just real sad.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  And t- that's, um, [SIGH] -- now I've been very impressed with the Montessori -- the Montessori schools.
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  But, [NOISE] at this point ... I think, "Well, why pay for somebody to do the same thing I'm doing with her -- "
R:  [NOISE]  Exactly.
L:  "-- you know, to challenge her".  [SIGH]  So, you know, and we just pretty much know [SIGH] what more she's interested in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I want to introduce things as --
R:  Yeah.
L:  --  we go.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  But, you know, if she really wants to work on math one day, we'll work on math one day.
R:  [SIGH]  Yes.  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, I [NOISE] -- I know that wouldn't happen in public school.  [LAUGH]  And, --
R:  [SIGH]  I know.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, I don't know about other kids but once she ... understands something, she doesn't want to d- -- have to do five or ten review sheets on it.  [SIGH]
R:  N- no.  [LAUGH]
L:  She's done with it, you know?  [SIGH]  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I remember being in school and having to do that.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  [SIGH]  So, do I.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and, [MN] you know, [SIGH] -- and I'm sure in public school she would have to do that -- well, now when she gets it ... she's done we go onto the next thing.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, you know, u- um , [MN] [NOISE] you know, my sister l- lives in Oklahoma and her kids [SIGH] they have a very, [SIGH] um, -- their school system -- they have great buildings.  I mean they have pools and elevators and all these things [SIGH] --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- but as far as the -- curriculum doesn't seem much different than it did in Georgia.
R:  [SIGH]  Okay.
L:  You know, but -- you know, we were so impressed [SIGH] when they m- moved out there and we thought, "Oh, my gosh!  What a fabulous school system they have".
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  But really, you know, it wasn't that much difference besides the great b- [LAUGH] buildings.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Interesting.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  You know, even when I was in college, when I was eighteen, [SIGH] I -- I didn't go into education 'cause I knew that, ah, [SIGH] teachers were underpaid and not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- respected and [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I have a c- couple of f- friends who really e- enjoyed teaching but [SIGH] they had --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- to leave just so they could give ... their kids a --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a quality, ah, e- education --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and quality of life, you know.
L:  You're right, you know, I think that's a lot of the problem in the schools today is that teachers are so under paid.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  They're not -- [SIGH] and in fact my next door neighbor, um, [SIGH] [MN] substituted -- she's a long term sub so, you know, --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- she would cover for people that were having cancer treatments and h- having babies and things [NOISE] like that.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And she used to t- talk to you about how much -- [SIGH] in elementary school [SIGH] the parents were so involved.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Good.
L:  The, um, [SIGH] you know, everybody's concerned about what's b- best for the kids but the older the grades get [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- the less concern there is.  [SIGH]  The --
R:  [SIGH]  Really?
L:  -- Teachers aren't as dedicated -- [SIGH] 'cause a lot of those teachers could be out in the work force earning a lot more money.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  You know, like a math teacher could be, [NOISE] [SIGH] um, going into the industry or s- -- you know?
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  Or a science teacher or whatever.  [SIGH]  But --
R:  [SIGH]  I know and [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] we always pay for what we value.  [NOISE]
L:  You're right.
R:  You know, like, in Seattle we have [SIGH] a stadium just for b- baseball and a- another one just for football [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- 'cause we value those things, sadly.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then the public schools have to go begging.
L:  Oh, you're right.
R:  You know.
L:  You're exactly right.  [NOISE]  Nobody wants to pay for it but they get upset when we don't [NOISE] [SIGH] g- graduate, you know, ... talented kids [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [SIGH]  Yes.
L:  -- that have [NOISE] -- you're right, that's --
R:  A- [COUGH] and I just think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, when a [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a -- an entry level b- bus driver --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with just a college -- ah, just a high school [SIGH] education [SIGH] can start out making more, than a -- [SIGH] a first year teacher, there's something --
L:  O- --
R:  -- wrong with that --
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  -- [SIGH] I think [SIGH] because I mean these [NOISE] are the people who are [SIGH] teaching our [NOISE] children.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And I think if [SIGH] -- if the public school system were [COUGH] able to do its job there wouldn't be a lot of people home schooling --
L:  [NOISE]  You're --
R:  -- [SIGH] so I think that's why you home school.
L:  Exactly.  Yes.
R:  'Cause you're not p- -- a- a- ah, you're not satisfied with what the school is doing.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]  'Cause [MN] my -- my friends, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the mom was home schooling s- seven kids --
L:  Oh, my goodness!
R:  -- felt like that that was the only way [NOISE] she could guarantee they would get a quality education.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Because they weren't [NOISE] [SIGH] -- I mean [COUGH] one of her sons was being p- passed on and he couldn't read.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  He was --
L:  Oh, that's sad.
R:  -- i- illiterate -- he was illiterate and he was being passed on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] 'cause it was easier.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  And what of his future if he -- [SIGH] I mean she corrected it 'cause s- she took him out and was home schooling.
L:  Right.
R:  But [MN] I've had friends who [SIGH] have not had a good education and not done well because they've been passed on.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  That's really sad.
R:  [SIGH]  It is sad --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [MN] because [MN] it's the kid that suffers.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]  I learned when my, um, -- my younger step son was in m- middle school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if a child turned fifteen while they were still in middle school, which they shouldn't but if they'd failed a grade or two [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it was possible they could turn fifteen.  [SIGH]  They would be automatically moved up to ninth grade and go to the high school.
R:  Wow!  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And I kept saying, "Why does that m- --I mean what -- what is going on with that?"  And he said, "Well, they don't want somebody to turn sixteen [SIGH] --"
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  "-- while they're in middle school [NOISE] and be driving into school".
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  W- [LAUGH] well -- well, if they can turn fifteen in middle school there's a problem --
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah --
L:  -- [NOISE] ... to begin with.
R:  -- yes.
L:  They don't need to be put automatically into ninth grade.
R:  N- no.  [SIGH]
L:  And then they're going to fail that.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And they'll probably end up dropping out because of that.
R:  I know it.
L:  That -- I was just -- I was [LAUGH] -- when I found that out I was just fuming, I thought -- well [LAUGH] you know, [SIGH] fortunately that was never the case with my step children.  They nev- never turned fifteen while they were in middle school.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  But, oh, I could -- I couldn't believe that!  I mean that's --
R:  I know.
L:  -- just asking for trouble.  [MN]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I know.
L:  And here we are educating these kids that have -- are not prepared to go into ninth grade.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  [MN]  It's very sad.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And [SIGH] --
L:  A- and, I think you're right a lot of d- decisions were made on ... b- budgetary --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, w- what's the cheapest thing to do?  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  And [NOISE] ... the kids pay the price.  You know that was a very good p- [LAUGH] point.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Exactly, yeah.  [SIGH]  But it's interesting what you said that [COUGH] the higher the grade level --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] the less parents tend to be interested in what their kids are doing in school.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH]  Wow!  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  I never thought about that.  [SIGH]
L:  I know when, um, [MN] -- now I -- I married my husband when my youngest s- step child was in --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- third grade --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean so we were always getting papers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- home and notes and things like that.  [SIGH]
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  Now he's in high school -- you know, he -- fortunately he's a very good student but, [SIGH] you know, he'd come home with a C on his report card and we'd go, "Well, w- what's going on with this?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean we have no idea.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And, you know, whereas in third grade if he made -- if he didn't turn in a homework assignment we'd get a call from the teacher, y- [LAUGH] you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  But --
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  -- we've have no idea.  But, you know -- and fortunately we can sit down with him and talk to him and he was able to bring that up.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  But I can just imagine being, [SIGH] [MN] you know, having a student that wasn't so suit- -- you know, dedicated [SIGH] and just -- he's failing class and you don't know it until it's too late.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Huh, -- [SIGH] I know.  [SIGH]  [MN]  And, um, [MN] like I said I know [COUGH] [SIGH] -- I -- I know more than one person who was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] passed along like you were saying --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and [SIGH] [COUGH] they -- they can barely read.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, that's --
R:  And they were just passed along.
L:  And you think, "What are they going to do --"
R:  [SIGH]
L:  "-- when they graduate?"
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  And it -- it's [NOISE] just -- it's not f- fair to the kid 'cause you're kind of, like, [SIGH] damning them to a life of, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] um, you know, marketing and a minimum wage jobs.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  You're exactly right.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  You know, one of my nieces that, [SIGH] you know, everybody bad mouths the Georgia school system --
R:  True.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, you know, I have nieces that live in O- Oklahoma and nieces --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and nephews that live in Maine [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I haven't seen a lot of difference in the s- [LAUGH] school systems.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  But my niece who was -- she'll be -- she'll be in six grade in the fall --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] but she just learned to read last year in the fifth grade.
R:  Wow!
L:  They had kept passing her on [SIGH] --
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I just couldn't figure out what the problem was but m- my -- you know, my brother in law and sister in law would complain about it.  And they always thought it was the teachers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or this or that or whatever.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  And I had gotten to the point where I told my husband, I said, "She", you know, 'cause I don't want her to go to middle school, not knowing how to read.
