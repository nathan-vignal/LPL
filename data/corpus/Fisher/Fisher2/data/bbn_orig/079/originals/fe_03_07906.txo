R:  I'd do it in a minute.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] You must not like that person very much. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I don't like him.  My name's Richard and I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, I'm Kathy and I'm in Indianapolis. [SIGH]
R:  Cool.  I'd do it in a minute.  I -- I love my [COUGH] -- my friends dearly but for a million dollars, I'm telling ya I'd do it.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, see now, I don't think I could.  Only because I think I would go crazy.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Because?
L:  I mean, [SIGH] okay, now you get a million dollars --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and what are you gonna do with it?
R:  Well, let's see --
L:  My -- my whole --
R:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
L:  My whole thing would be I would wanna go out and spend it with my family and my friends.
R:  Of course.  You sound like that kind of person.  Real nice and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Family oriented and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  XL
L:  And so now I can't speak to my best friend again.  Well, that would just suck. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, in my case since, um, I'm an only child and my parents have passed.
L:  Ah.
R:  It's surprising, if you have a lot of money, how many --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- friends you have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- overnight. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I know.  But how can you trust them? [NOISE]
R:  They're not your true friends 'cause you have a million dollars and they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just want you for their -- for your money.  No, I totally --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But [SIGH] -- but I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- you know, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was a struggling student and I know all that stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
R:  And it's like -- at my age, fifty four --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't wanna struggle any more than I have to and if -- if that were to ever happen, if that were the only thing I had to do I would --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do it.  I would say this is nothing personal, you all. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] But it's either you or a million bucks. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  So, I know exactly that -- what I would do and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's why I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- said that even before I told you my name because I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no doubt.
L:  In a heart beat, huh?
R:  Not at that.  Didn't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- even have to think about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that one. 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  No, there are something, you know, you [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, you know, that I [SIGH] -- I wouldn't do.  You know if I had to commit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a felony --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or rob a bank or the a chance of getting shot and killed.  There are certain things I wouldn't do.
L:  Okay, chance of getting shot and killed I probably wouldn't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Rob a bank, [MN] I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  You're braver than I am. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I have --
R:  Much braver.
L:  I have been told I'm an adrenalin junky so that's very possible. [LAUGH]
R:  Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know people like that.  Just they like the -- the buzz of excitement. 
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
R:  And you're that kind of person?
L:  Well, not any more.  I used to be.  I'm a mom, so -- and -- and my husband just jokes about how much I changed when I became a mom.
R:  Really?
L:  Like I have other people to consider now.  You know?  It's not just me.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when you --
L:  Can't go flinging myself off of things. [LAUGH]
R:  So, when you were young and dumb you were foolhardy? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- were many, many things that I did.  In fact my father used [NOISE] to say, "I don't know if you're really brave or really stupid or really stubborn or a combination of all three". [SIGH] 
R:  Wow.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, did you do real dumb things or are you just a dare devil? 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean --
L:  Um --
R:  You know, did you get in trouble or were you just a dare devil?
L:  No.  I was a dare devil.  I didn't -- actually I was kind of a goody two shoes if you really --
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  I mean but I [NOISE] -- but like I would get something in my head and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It -- it would be done, regardless of the [inaudible] that I got cautioned.  You know, it was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah.  Whatever". [SIGH] Um --
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE] So, no but [NOISE], um, in fact I vividly remember [NOISE] and this wasn't exactly [SIGH] -- this wasn't exactly too much of a dare devil but I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- vividly remember a time were I [NOISE], uh, had [NOISE] -- I had planned a trip [NOISE] to Canada.  I mean --
R:  Okay.
L:  The couple, or the -- the guy that I'd planned it with we were totally, completely broke but we wanted to go up to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Canada and we wanted --
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  -- to go and do this and -- and the week before we were -- we were gonna take his 'cause mine was not even close to reliable.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  And the [LAUGH] week before we were gonna do this his car got totalled and I'm like --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  Well, we can take my car.  And he's like, "Well, maybe we should put this off".  I'm like, "No, we planned it.  I have this set in my head.  We're doing it".  And --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on the way home on the Canaan[?] bridge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the brakes got frozen and --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- uh, [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  We got stranded in Detroit overnight which in an -- I mean, okay, it's Detroit in a bad neighborhood which pretty much is the whole city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it was -- I vividly remember sitting in the parking lot at a Seven Eleven 'cause the door was locked 'cause they were in the middle of a drug deal inside --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and so, you know, we had to wait until that was over so I could go in and see if I could get something to eat. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it's interesting you said that 'cause I was talking to a friend who's like you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I was telling him --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I wish were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I had -- I wish I had been more like that.  You know, taking chances and --
L:  I have got -- you know, I've -- I have always maintained that, uh, you know, it's worse -- if it's a good story that comes out of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's worth whatever it is you get in trouble with. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Because I mean, I [NOISE] -- I have many injuries due to foolhardiness, um, but you know what?  I've got some really cool scars with some really cool stories that go along with 'em. [LAUGH] 
R:  And I bet you have stories that people think aren't true and they're actually true.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We used to -- in fact, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  My husband always tells me that I should call into this radio show in town that says --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, oh, you know, that -- to -- and tell some of my stories 'cause nobody'll --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- believe 'em.  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're -- they're true. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But, no.  I mean, [MN] with -- but in all of that I have always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had [MN] one, at the very least --
R:  [MN]
L:  One really, really good friend --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to share it with and --
R:  Excellent.
L:  -- it would just -- I mean, if I would've done it by myself it wouldn't have been any fun.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, I can't [NOISE], you know, I can't say that [NOISE]   There's a lot of things that I'd do for a million dollars but --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- giving up my friends isn't one of 'em. [NOISE]
R:  You know, and knowing [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you for these last five minutes you sound so intense and like --
L:  Oh, ver- --
R:  I totally believe you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, that -- and that's one thing you wouldn't do is that -- where I'd do it in a heart beat. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Totally.  A heart beat.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] So, it sounds like though your friends and family and children are very, very important to you.
L:  Yeah, they really are.
R:  W- -- and that is --
L:  They -- they are -- they are my life.  I mean, my kids are my life and my husband, again, if -- in fact if I had to pick a best friend he would be my best friend.
R:  [SIGH] Again, I was telling my room mate.  I was saying, "Mark, the woman you marry has to be -- has to be your best friend".
L:  [NOISE] God, yes.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, my god, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  It won't work otherwise.  It really won't.  I mean, okay, maybe that best friend.  It depends on if, you know, you've got this friend that you've lived life along --
R:  Sure.
L:  But they gotta be -- it's gonna b- -- have to be darn close.
R:  Yes.  Yes, I was -- we were saying that just last night.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that he has a girlfriend.  It's like [COUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It has to become -- or at least, one of your best friends.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hands down.  You have got -- I mean, it's not gonna work otherwise.  
R:  Yes.
L:  Because what happens, you know, ten, fifteen years from now when we're both old and grey and -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Let's face it there's not a whole lot else holding us together, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You've got- -- you've gotta be.  You've just gotta be. [SIGH] So --
R:  You know, I really like that when I see an old couple that's probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in their nineties and they've been married for sixty years.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  And there has to be something, you know, that has to be so cool.
L:  Yeah.  My grandparents celebrated their fiftieth and, you know, they -- they would always razz each other but there -- there was no -- when my grandmother died we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all expected my grandfather to go immediately after because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they were very, very close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they very much loved each other.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And so that's what I want.  I mean, that's -- that's what I've seen.  That's what I want. [LAUGH] 
R:  Now, were you born in -- in that area or did you move?
L:  No.  I was born and raised in the Chicago area actually. 
R:  All right.  All right.
L:  In -- In the suburbs and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- grew up in a very large family who --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- actually I'm not all that close to.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I've kinda gone off and -- and developed my own little extended family out of my friends and --
R:  Good, good.
L:  -- my immediate family.
R:  Good.
L:  Um, so, yeah.  But that -- that's very important to me.
R:  [NOISE] So, you must've -- as soon as you became a mom it's like you must've changed overnight. [NOISE] And no more dare devil stunts and --
L:  [MN] It's that my -- my husband claims that I did. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I was gonna say, no -- no --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- more -- I was gonna say no more going out.  Like he wants to go out and jump out of an airplane.  I mean, he wants to go --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- parachuting and stuff like that.  And like, "That's fine.  Go ahead.  I don't care.  Not a --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- problem".
R:  [COUGH]
L:  And he's like, "Well, you wouldn't do it?"  And I said, "No, not right now".
R:  No, [NOISE] no.
L:  Ask me five years ago.  Sure, here's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not a problem.  I'm right there with ya".
R:  I -- I think your husband --
L:  But somebody's gotta be here for the kids in case --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something happens.
R:  I think your husband has a death wish. [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, no.  Well, his father says, "Why would you jump out of a perfectly good plane?"
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  There's nothing wong with it. [LAUGH] He would jump?
L:  [LAUGH] Why would you jump out of a perfectly good plane? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Y- y- -- sounds like maybe your husband [MN] is a lot like you were. [LAUGH]
L:  We -- well, there's a fair amount of age difference between the two of us.  He's about ten years younger than I and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there's a lot of things that I got a chance to do that he didn't.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so [MN] I mean, hey, you know, you wanna go and you do some stupid things.  The only thing I've ever drawn the line at is bungy jumping 'cause I can think up a lot more fun ways to mess up my back. [LAUGH]
R:  You've done that?
L:  No, that's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the one thing that I won't do is --
R:  Okay, 'cause --
L:  -- is I'm not gonna do that because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm -- I'm -- like I said I can think of a lot more creative ways to mess up my back than flinging myself off a bridge but --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that's --
L:  I'd jump out of an airplane, um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, you know, I would hang glide.  I've done --
R:  Mama mia.
L:  All kinds of things.
R:  But and it's like my friend Mark, my room mate, you know, [SIGH] at least, you know, you've done 'em and me I'm going, "Wow, that must've been cool and here you've done 'em".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, so at least you're not gonna be when you're eighty going, "Would of, could of, should of", you know?
L:  Well, that's the whole point.  Yeah, I just --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  I -- I just don't see a point in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] life is there to live. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, you're not gonna be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When you're old you're not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gonna be saying, "Well, I wish --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I had done that 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're gonna -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:   You will -- you will --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have done it.
L:  Yep
R:  Probably before you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were thirty. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, definitely.  'Cause you can't wait until after you're thirty 'cause that's just -- you're broken by that point.  At least I was. [LAUGH] 
R:  What -- what -- what was -- 
L:  You gotta do it ahead of time.
R:  What was the scariest thing you ever did in your opinion?
L:  Scari-
