R:  Hi, my name's Jen, uh, I'm twenty six, from Ohio.
L:  I'm Kathy, and I'm fifty eight, from Minnesota.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, Jen.
R:  Uh, how are you?
L:  I am just fine, how are you?
R:  Oh, I'm doing, these things are always so much fun.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [NOISE] So --
R:  Ah --
L:  Do you --
R:  -- yes.
L:  -- go to movies much?
R:  I used to, when it used to be cheaper, but --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- now they're, like, I don't -- you have kids, right, I'm sure you've -- you have some somewhere, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- well you know how -- well, seriously, to take a family, I have a ten month old, so I've --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- three kids, forget it, it's like fifty bucks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, after everything, so we [NOISE] usually rent movies and stay home now and um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  That's what we do too, even [MN] my kids are all grown --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and so it's not taking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kids, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- even for the two of us, it just -- plus, you know, time wise, it's just easier to set your own time --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- to do it and watch it at home and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and know that, you know, if you have to take a break you can shut it off and start over again. [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  You can't do that at the movie.
R:  Yeah, well, especially now that DVDs came out, uh, DVD player and, you know --
L:  Yeah, now --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- -- we don't have a DVD --
R:  You don't?
L:  -- player, but our son does, so, they are really nice, clear pictures and --
R:  Well, the price --
L:  -- and things, but -- yeah.
R:  -- the price on 'em have come -- 'cause we bought one, like, last year and it was, like, I think one fifty, but at Christmas they, you know, after Thanksgiving they have the big sales, I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- got one for, like, forty bucks --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- so, yeah, so --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- at Wal Mart.
L:  Oh.
R:  So --
L:  I might have to start looking --
R:  -- wasn't --
L:  -- for -- I --
R:  Oh, they've --
L:  -- yeah, I think my son said theirs was really cheap, I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- know what he paid for it, but --
R:  They've come down l- a lot.  Actually, I have a Apex and -- which is like a standard brand, basically --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, I mean, it works fine and it plays your, um, you know, your music CDs too.
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's what -- that's what my son said, he -- they really like theirs, I've --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't know if we'll ever get one or not.  We don't rent that many movies, but I would guess that eventually the DVDs will just be easier to rent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, there'll be more --
R:  Right.  They're going to --
L:  -- things --
R:  -- probably get re-
L:  -- available.
R:  They're gonna probably get rid of, you know, VHS tapes eventually --
L:  See I think --
R:  -- I'm sure --
L:  -- so too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what's the last movie you saw?  I guess they --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- want to know that, too. [MN] [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't even remember what we watched last.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, the last time I went to the theater we went to see The Grinch, so that was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- two -- almost two years ago.  It came out on Christmas time of two thousand and one, I believe, yeah.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  And then, um, the last one we rented was Ice Age.  So --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh --
R:  -- that was --
L:  -- was that good?
R:  That was really cute, yes.
L:  I haven't seen that one.
R:  That's a good movie.  Have you seen Shrek?
L:  No.
R:  Okay, well, if you see Shrek now, Shrek came out, um, about a year and a half a- uh?  About a year and a half to two years ago and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it has Mike Myers, um, i- it's a animated cartoon, but since they do the animation so well now, it's more, uh, it's hard to ex- it's really good, put it that way, for both --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- adults and kids, but Ice Age is basically the same way, it's really [NOISE] cute.  It's all about --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a mammoth and, um, [LIPSMACK] uh, a little sloth and they find a baby [NOISE] and, um, duh, this is way back, you know, in the ice age --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the family goes off because their tribe got burned down and then they try to get the baby back with the family but, it's a cute movie.
L:  Oh, that sounds cute --
R:  So --
L:  -- we might have to --
R:  It was pretty good.
L:  -- try to find that.  We do have one theater, um, [LIPSMACK] that's about seventeen miles from us that is cheaper than, um, theaters, but they don't get the newest releases.
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so we sometimes go, you know, to that theater because it's not as expensive --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's only, like, four dollars, whereas I think we pay six --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- or seven --
R:  Yeah, see, I'm -- I'm in, um, [MN] base -- I'm not too far away from Cleveland, Ohio, is where I live --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, I don't know if [LAUGH] you ever see that on -- on the news or whatever, but we're, um, we're -- our theaters are, like, seven fifty or something like that, so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I think, um, we're [MN] close to Minneapolis too and the mo- the theaters there are about la- like, nine.
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and, so, I know --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- we have gone there, but it's just way too expensive, you know, for a couple of hours --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- for a couple of people, four people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just way too much.
R:  Yeah.  The convenience of renting your own is -- does definitely has the, you know, convenience of -- than going.
L:  Right.  And even though we're in a small town and our -- our, uh, rental place doesn't have a large variety, they do have, um, you know, enough that if you want to -- especially when it's storming in the winter, or --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- something, i- you know, you can stay in and watch a movie.
R:  Yeah, we do that a lot with my mom, mm, rent during the wintertime and she doesn't have a DVD player, so I rent or I tape for her and, 'cause I get HBO on cable --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- so I'll --
L:  -- okay.
R:  -- tape a movie for her and she can watch it in her VCR, so it works out kinda well.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah.  We have a couple movie channels, we don't get HBO, but, you know, some of our cable channels have movies on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we watch those a lot, that's -- because they're handy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if you get in on the middle of one, or whatever, you know it's going to be replayed again --
R:  E- exactly.
L:  -- you can maybe catch the beginning of it, or --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- or watch the times and see, if you started and know that it looks like it'll be good, then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we just check the time of when it's going to start and we'll go to something else and then come back to that and I like that feature, 'cause then we can see the movie and yet it's free and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and enjoy a movie anyway. [LIPSMACK] So ... [MN]
R:  [NOISE] Out of there, monkey. [NOISE] Sorry, he's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- tearing up the house.
L:  Oh, well, I have three grandchildren --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- now, so, when they come to visit I know what that's like.
R:  Mhm.  Hm.
L:  And I know our ol- our grandson that's six loves movies and they do take him to movies and, you know, in the theater some but they do rent a lot of DVDs.
R:  Yeah, mine's into Blue's Clues already. [LIPSMACK] So --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- mhm, so I'm always going to the library and stuff like that [LIPSMACK] for him --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, the- uh, Finding Nemo actually looks really cute.  That just came --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- out.
L:  -- that's what I heard.  My other son did go to Finding Nemo and he -- they just loved it.
R:  Yeah, that one looks good.  Tha-
L:  And --
R:  -- that's the other one I want to see.  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. [LAUGH] I --
L:  No --
R:  -- was just thinking --
L:  -- I was just gonna say, that's at our theater now and we've been debating going, but it's just been a busy summer and so --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- haven't gotten there, but that's another nice thing in the summer to go to the theaters, 'cause they are air conditioned and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just a nice place to relax and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- get out of the heat, whatever, so --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's --
L:  -- that's --
R:  -- getting hot here and, [MN] soon --
L:  We haven't --
R:  -- it'll be in the nineties. [SIGH]
L:  -- yeah, we haven't been very hot lately, but they say it's supposed to get up in the upper eighties and nineties just next week, so probably --
R:  Joey.
L:  -- for the fourth of July.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Wonderful.
L:  It will be nice and hot.  So, but that's nice to know that the Ice Age was a good movie --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- we might --
R:  -- that one I would recommend.
L:  -- have to take that one in, I've -- we've seen a lot of the advertisements on that.  My husband likes movies like that anyway, he just sort of enjoys --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- relaxing and --
R:  -- clean movies are always good to watch, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's something you don't get to see a lot of anymore, even kids' movies, now, you know, there something in them that, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  It -- it depends, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's always nice to see a good, clean movie.
L:  Right.
R:  Another one that I heard was good for the adults is My Greek Wedding, I haven't seen it yet, though.
L:  Oh.  I've seen it advertised, but I don't know -- I don't know that I have heard anybody that has --
R:  Or -- sorry --
L:  -- seen it.
R:  -- it's called My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I think is what it's called.
L:  Right, right.  Yeah --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah.
R:  I heard that one --
L:  I have --
R:  -- was pretty good.
L:  But --
R:  So, I was trying --
L:  -- I don't --
R:  -- to think of --
L:  -- of -- I've --
R:  -- oh, another one is, um, [LIPSMACK] oh what is it called?  Monsters Inc, have you seen that one?
L:  Oh, no, but I've heard --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really good.
R:  That one, too, I -- we actually, um, got to borrow it from our family and my son absolutely loved it 'cause it has a little girl's voice through the whole thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so he was real --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- attracted to that, but --
L:  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.
R:  -- but --
L:  Yeah, that looks like a good one from I've seen the advertisement on it and -- and stuff, so [COUGH] -- I'm losing my voice, we were at a cla- class reunion this last weekend --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I think I talked too much.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know how it is when you haven't seen people for --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- quite a while.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] And the voice goes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so it's hard to talk. [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] But, um, well, I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH] We're just supposed --
L:  -- what else --
R:  -- to --
L:  -- to say about --
R:  -- [LAUGH] exactly.
L:  -- movies.
R:  They're, like, "Here --"
L:  I --
R:  "-- talk for a long time about one movie" and it's, uh, I talked to another lady, I think she was from Alabama and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they wanted to know about minimum wage and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm like, how long can you talk about minimum wage?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, so we --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just talked about other things and [MN] okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, and [NOISE] can't hang up too fast and want to get paid. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right, you don't wanna miss --
R:  Um --
L:  -- out on something, but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  This is definitely neat, though, how they set it up and ...
