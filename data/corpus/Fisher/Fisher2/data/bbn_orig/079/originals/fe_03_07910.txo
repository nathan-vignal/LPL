R:  I'M Brian.
L:  Hi.  I'm Kathy.
R:  Hi, Kathy.  How you doing? [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  How are you?  It's kind of late here but I was surprised --
R:  Yeah, what time is it exactly, Kathy?
L:  Eleven.
R:  No, way.  What, eleven o'clock?
L:  Yes.
R:  You must calling -- I must be calling you from the West Coast or something?
L:  Yeah, I guess so.  What time's it there?
R:  Uh, it's, uh, I guess it's about, uh, about ten minutes to twelve over here.
L:  Oh, my. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  The topic was, uh, if somebody offered me a million dollars not to speak to my best friend again.  Uh, you know something?  I don't think I would take the million dollars.  First of all in this -- in this economy, uh, nowadays it's -- it's not enough money to live off of and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- second of all I believe in, uh   I don't know I just believe in, uh, you know loyalty and everything.  It's -- and it's just unethical not to be able to speak to my best friend again. 
L:  Really.
R:  So, I would -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't take the -- take the million dollars.  It would have to be at least -- I don't know.  First of all they didn't -- they didn't even mention, uh, if it's a real -- real true blue best friend first of all and, uh, I don't think I would be able to do it.  It's -- it's immoral and it's unethical.  What about you?
L:  Oh, no.  I -- I agree with you.  I'm glad to hear it because let's say we're saying it.  I'm sitting here going, "No.  No there's no way". [LAUGH] Right now I'm going through some really tough times --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and if I didn't have my best friend to talk to, uh, I'm sorry it wouldn't be worth any amount of money not to be able to do that.
R:  Yeah, just it wouldn't -- it wouldn't -- it wouldn't be worth it.  You know what I mean?
L:  No.
R:  As far as, uh   What if -- what if -- what if they -- what if it was ten million dollars?  Do you think that would be, uh --
L:  No.  Nah.  There's no amount of money that would make up for that.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  The same with me.  I don't think there's no amount of money that would be able to, uh, be offered to me that I wouldn't be able to speak to my best friend again.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause there's -- there's -- there's nothing like, uh, having a true friend.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, they're not easy to come by. [LAUGH]
R:  Somebody who you can talk to through thick and thin.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Talk -- talk through, uh, talk with about anything.  Someone who can help you out with your problems which you might be going through.  You know, there's no amount of money you can put a price on true friendship.  You know what I mean?
L:  No.  I agree.
R:  So I don't -- I don't think I would ever take, uh -- how is it over where -- where you're at?  Where are you -- I'm in Pittsburgh.  Where are you at?
L:  In Texas.
R:  Oh, you're in Texas?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, it's -- it's eighty degrees up here.  What is it, about a hundred and twenty down there?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?
L:  Well, it was -- it was in the nineties but we're having storms right now so it's cooled off.
R:  You're having storms right now?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, I mean --
L:  But I'm --
R:  I guess a million dollars is just it's -- it's -- it's no type of money to, uh, to even offer me something like that not to speak to my best friend.  I mean, I wouldn't do it for a billion dollars.  You know what I mean?
L:  No.  No, I don't --
R:  I wouldn't do it for no -- no amount of money but I'm just saying it -- you know, a million dollars?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's just -- it's just not enough and I'm going through some tough times up here in Pittsburgh too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, but I -- I don't think I would be -- you know, I don't think I would take the money and -- and not be able to speak to, or see my best friend again, you know?
L:  No.  No.  Money's just money and, you know, of course when you don't have it it's very important. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- that's very true.  When you don't have it.
L:  But, uh, you can go -- there are ways of making it.  Going out, but like you said, I don't know best friends don't come along every day.  Good, reliable, loyal friends don't come along very often in life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  I can count on my fingers my -- on my one hand how many best friends I done[?] had.
L:  That's right.
R:  Just on my one hand.  You know?
L:  That's right.  
R:  And, uh, hey I'm -- I'm thirty five years old, Kathy.  Know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I can count on just on my -- my -- my one hand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how many best friends I done had.  You know?
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm older than you are and I -- I still can only count 'em.  I have a lot of friends and acquaintances and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people I do things with but, uh, best friends?  No.  There's not very many of 'em.
R:  They don't come along every day, do they Kathy?
L:  No, unfortunate- -- well, I don't know.  Maybe that's a good thing though.  They're special and we -- and we --
R:  Yeah, they are special.  You know?
L:  And maybe we treasure them more because they don't come along all the time.
R:  But I tell you one thing what -- what -- what -- what they -- what the, um, what they didn't mention was, um, your, um, your best friend -- what they didn't mention was, uh, was your best friend your real true best friend?  You know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- what I mean?  'Cause you could have a --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- best friend and a best friend gonna stab you in the back.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  I guess -- I guess they mean, um, somebody that you consider loyal and a best friend right now at this point in time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because, like you said, anybody can change.  That's true.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess you can't ever be sure.  Believe me I know first hand.  You can't be sure. [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause I'm gonna tell you right now.  At this point in time right now, Kathy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't even have a best friend.  I don't -- at this point in time I just have a lot of associates.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't have a best friend right now.  All my best friends they left me, uh, two years ago.
L:  Really?
R:  I had, like -- I had like two of 'em.  Yeah, they were really, really good true blue best friends to me and they went out of town.
L:  Oh, they moved away.
R:  Well, one went to North Carolina and one went down Georgia.  So, they both left me.
L:  Yeah.  They've -- they've -- They've moved away, huh?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they moved away and I have no --
L:  Oh, that's hard.
R:  No -- I have no idea where they're whereabouts are at.  How to contact 'em or --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- anything, you know?
L:  Oh, they didn't stay in touch, huh?
R:  No, so right now --
L:  That's --
R:  So, right no- --
L:  Oh, I guess -- I guess you could give one of them up for a million dollars.  It wouldn't matter. [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I'm saying.  Right [LAUGH] -- right now I could -- I could, uh, if somebody offered me a million dollars I could take the m- m- the million dollars right now because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't have a best friend.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, well I guess I'm blessed.  I have several very, very good friends.  It would be hard for me to call one of them my best.  Um --
R:  Yeah?
L:  But there is one I probably call -- there's one I call when I need something done or I need good hard advice.  In other words she'll play devil's advocate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if she has to.  But there's another one I know that I can call about anything and she's not gonna judge.  She's not going to make comments.  She's going to totally understand and be empathetic and be there and, um, that's the one I think I consider my best friend.
R:  Well that's g- -- that's good.  That's really, really good.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What about on the other hand.  Do you think -- let me ask you something.  Do you think your best friends, knowing them, that if they were offered a million dollars, that they wouldn't talk to you any more?
L:  Yep.  I do -- I b- -- no.  I believe she wouldn't.
R:  You believe she wouldn't take it?
L:  Oh, I know she wouldn't.  I know her values.
R:  You know she would take it?
L:  No.  She would not.
R:  Oh, she wouldn't take it.  Okay.
L:  No.  She wouldn't take it.  I know her values.  She's very, uh, she's got high values.
R:  She's got hi- --
L:  And she could -- she could really use the money too I can tell ya.
R:  She could really use it but she wouldn't take it though?
L:  No.  Because you know what?  As you get older, and you seem to already know this, but the one thing after all I've gone through the last year, the one thing I have to hang on to is that for the rest of my life there's only one person I know absolutely I'll go to bed with the rest of my life and that's myself.
R:  That's yours- [LAUGH] --
L:  And ever- -- yeah.  And every night when you go to bed you need to be able to face yourself. [LAUGH] And if I did something like that I don't think I could.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  There are just certain things that you know when the end of your -- like at the end of the life if -- when you face your maker, you know, you can look him square in the eye and say, "Hey, I -- I, you know, did what I thought was, you know, what I knew was right".  
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But if you can't -- if you can't do that, what's the rest of it worth?
R:  That -- yeah, yeah.  That's -- that's true.  That's true.  So, is --
L:  Because we're t- --
R:  Huh?
L:  We're taught this life is fleeting.  This life is short, relative to what we've got coming.  So  [LAUGH]
R:  You know something?  And I'm glad you mentioned that.  Are you Christian, uh, Christian oriented?
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  You are?
L:  Yes.
R:  That -- that is so good, Kathy.  That's really, really good that you mentioned about our maker, you know?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- 'cause I truly believe in god and do you believe in his son and all that too?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, that is --
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  That's -- that is really great, you know.  Even if --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- I -- I tell you what.  You know, I, uh, it's such -- i- if you really don't have Jesus and God in your life, what's -- w- what is all the money in the world anyway?  It's nothing.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  That's right.
R:  'Cause y- y- you're not gonna really be happy.  You know, I didn't -- there's people who -- who are multi millionaires and billionaires who kill themselves --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- because they're not happy.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know?  They have a big empty void in their life, in -- in their heart and, you know, that's where Jesus is putting somewhere at.  You know?
L:  That's right.  And I couldn't have gotten through the last year, uh, without that.  I mean, Jesus and m- my faith and my relationship with god is what's got me through it.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And I'm so fortunate that I have a teenage daughter who, um, has a strong faith and it's gotten through -- her through --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- unbelievable things.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, just loss after loss that you can't even imagine.  Um --
R:  What?
L:  You talk a- -- you talk about friends moving away.  She's just lost everyone that was close to her.  It's just like she's come to believe almost that the minute she gets close to someone that's it, they're gonna move away.
R:  Oh.
L:  Something happens in their life and it just seems to happen but, you know she keeps going because, uh, she has a faith and she's, you know, it gets her down for a while a little bit but not like you can -- and not just that but both her grandparents died last year, her dad left us.  It's just like she has   I -- I just -- I can't even tell you.
R:  Kathy, Kathy.  Hold on one second please.
L:  Mhm, Uh-huh.
R:  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on. [NOISE] 
L:  [MN] [PAUSE] Goodness, is that getting any closer Sarah?  That [inaudible] are getting closer.  Okay.  Hm.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, I'm -- Kathy, I'm very, very sorry.  I -- I --
L:  That's okay.
R:  I'm on a -- I'm talking on the -- on a phone and I just -- I had a little interruption, uh, just --
L:  Well, um, have you done one of these before?
R:  Uh, yeah, I ha- -- I have done one of these before.  Yes, I have.
L:  Okay.  This is the first time for me.  So --
R:  This the first time for you?
L:  Yeah.  I have only answered -- I mean, I've missed the calls before when they've come through.  I, you know, was out somewhere.  This is my cellphone, the number I gave so I didn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I missed them before when they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- called me.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  This is the first time and it sounded very intriguing and I must say it is.  I think it's very interesting.
R:  Yes, it is very intriguing and they need to have date -- date lines like this also. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH] That's -- oh, [LAUGH] yeah, right.
R:  Y- you know what I mean?
L:  That'd be interesting.  That would --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be interesting.  
R:  Or should I say, in our case, Christian dateline. [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  There you go.  Yeah, that would --
R:  S- --
L:  -- be interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  So -- so --
L:  Kind of a long way a way though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  So, have you been living in Texas
