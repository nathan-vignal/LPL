L:  Hello, this is Janie.
R:  Hello, this is Grace.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  And, uh c- so the topic is the school system?
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] So, we have --
L:  Do you --
R:  -- ten minutes to k- talk about our opinion about that.  Is that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- correct?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Do you have -- do you have children in the [COUGH] public school system?
R:  Actually I don't.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I ha- -- my brother, um, has, uh, children in the public school system.
L:  Ah, I have three in the system.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  And I --
R:  Um, I ...
L:  -- um, I have certainly found it adequate.  My, uh, youngest go to an a- er, a year round school
R:  Mm, mhm.
L:  And we love it.
R:  You like being year round as opposed to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the summers off?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  'Cause it's --
R:  How come?
L:  Well, what I find is that everyone can, you know, keep the momentum going in that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, you [COUGH] get up, go to school, do the homework, you know, there's PTA, there's all these functions and so everybody's working real hard for like, you know, forty five days then we all get three weeks off.
R:  Right.
L:  So, we all get a nice break and then it's, you know, back on for another forty five days.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I think it's just easier for everyone to, um, you know, keep up the pace because they know they get the extra long break and then, um [COUGH] I think the kids, you know, retain the information.  Because my kids just got out, uh, a week and a half ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they start school again on July twenty third.  [COUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So they get four weeks off for the summer.
R:  Mhm.  That's an idea.
L:  It's a problem though if you have like an older child in say junior high, or high school, and they're on a regular, you know, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- school year.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my brother has a child with special needs so my experience has been about how to, er, sort of deal with that integration.  [SIGH] And, uh, I guess for, you know, the special needs, it's -- it's easier to have the -- the m- --  the long -- the big time off but it just, I guess, it just depends on -- on the child --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ay?
L:  Well, my daughter had --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- she's second grade going on third.
R: Mhm.
L:  And there's a boy that has autism in her class.
R:  Oh, okay.  That, yeah -- that's what my -- my s- -- my nephew has.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- yeah, I guess, because I went on a field trip and his mom rode +with +me -- rode with me and we talking about it, they're d- putting him into a different elementary school [COUGH] in our county, and it's still public, but she said that, um, at the other school, I guess, there's a group of children with autism.
R:  Okay.
L:  And -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she's observed the program and the way that they teach 'em there and she thinks he'd benefit greater from that because apparently it -- the school he's currently at, he's like the only child that has autism and they assign him, um, an assistant who helps him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I know she, apparently the mom, I mean she doesn't feel that's the best thing for him and ultimately I -- I do believe it's the parents who determine, you know, what is best for their child.
R:  Right.
L:  And she thinks that he'd be better with this other program and part of it is, I guess, recess.  I guess that's a --
R:  Right.
L:  -- big concern for her is that he's not, you know, forced with the rest of the -- to have recess with the rest of the kids.
R:  Yeah, it's tough.  It's t- to socialize -- the socialization is, uh [SIGH] uh, different.  Er, like they have different needs.
L:  [MN]
R:  And I like the -- the school system because it's recognizing the fact that integration is really helpful for kids with special needs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't feel, um, stigmatized as much, uh, to be able to find ways to integrate and still [SIGH] deal with what they need to deal with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I like that.  I guess, the only thing I'm concerned about really about the system is the, uh, gangs, the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't know about you.  Uh, does [LIPSMACK] [MN] bullying is, uh, that a bad problem?  That --
L:  Well, um --
R:  -- whole --
L:  -- here there is -- the kids, once they finish sixth grade, they do go to a school at seventh and eighth grade; that's huge.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is a big concern for everyone in our community.  A lot of people have pulled their children out.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But that was more a problem, um, with the principal.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, who's now gone and we have a new one.  But now so many kids -- parents have pulled their kids that the only kids that are left are the kids that, you know, have no parent control.
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  And so, yeah.  So that seventh, eighth grade thing is a big concern for everyone.  I -- I believe our high school is great and I [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] have a freshman there.  He joined the football team, um, orientation day --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's been a godsend because he has just been so busy and apparently once you're on the football team, you know, the football players look out for each other.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, so he -- 
R:  That is good, huh.
L:  [COUGH] Yeah, yeah, so even though he's in high school, we've had no -- no concerns and that there, you know, we just finished this last year, he's gonna be a sophomore now, and there were no incidences that we know of.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, in fact I can't even really remember him even talking about even [MN] seeing any fights or anything at school.  And it's a big metropolitan high school.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  So ...
R:  Wow, that's -- that says -- that says a lot, actually.
L:  But I know like in the inner cities, like I saw some program about New York and they've got some new person running their school systems and one of the problems they've had there is that people move a lot and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kids have to go to different schools --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the whole teaching structure is different.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, he's trying to make it to where every school in the whole New York City area, you know, every grade is teaching the same thing from week to week.  So when children do [COUGH] change schools, whether it's high school or not, they can pick right up where they were at, at their old school.
R:  Mm, mhm.  That makes sense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hadn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- heard about that.
L:  So, yeah, you know, gangs, it -- it scares me too but then I'm fortunate in that I'm the breadwinner and the deal is my husband, um, is home with the kids and he's at the school every day.  He does recess every day.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh --
L:  So --
R:  -- okay, yeah, [several inaudible words].
L:  I know that he is there, you know?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And he's --
R:  That makes a difference.
L:  -- making sure my kids are not bullied or picked on --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- or ...
R:  Interesting.  And [MN] --
L:  And -- and it's --
R:  -- do they have anything in the school system like a p- uh, like an anti bullying program or strategy or anything like that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, [SIGH] not that I'm aware of, no.
R:  That -- that would be something I think would be -- like it's a -- almost like a cycle educational thing where the kids can feel empowered to, um, speak, you know, set their boundaries, learn what boundaries are and set them, and learn that this is what bullying behavior is, this is what it's not and this is what I can deal -- this is what -- how I can deal with it because as children you think, "Well, those things are really needed in school" [NOISE] but these days it seems like they really --
L:  Oh, I agree.
R:  -- they really do need to lean -- learn those skills and if they don't learn them from home, they -- they suffer when they go into like a social, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- social setting.  Educational --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- setting.
L:  I -- I can --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- remember, I mean, kids just c- -- even when I was at school, I mean kids can be so cruel.
R:  Er, yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  And that hasn't changed.  My daughter's in second grade --
R:  And not having any skills or resources to deal with it.
L:  Right.
R:  Well --
L:  Right.
R:  -- different kids have different levels of resources and skills.  They've -- they've been taught different things.  But it'd be nice to have that, sort of, education at school so people can know or they -- they -- the kids can know, "Okay, this is bullying.  This is what I can do.  This is what I can do" and, you know, so that they can stay safe while they learn.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, my daughter, um, came home one day crying because, um, one of the girls told her she was fat.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  And --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, that's definitely a type of bullying too.
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's like emotional cruelty and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh -- and [MN] what do you do?  Really?  When that happens.  You know, is -- teachers, are they prepared?  And does the school support, you know, a safe environment so the kid can focus on school and not, "Oh, gosh, what are my classmates are saying about me now".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Kind of a distraction.
L:  I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one thing I feel strongly about anywhere.  I'm in California --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so with the budget crisis, you know, money is tighter than ever.  And we're losing programs.
R:  Mm.
L:  But --
R:  Mhm, mhm, yeah.
L:  -- overall I -- it felt -- although, I mean, you have to be involved.  I mean, as a parent --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you ju- you just can't send your kids to public education every day and expect everything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- to go smoothly.  You have to be involved in -- it's really sad because those kids whose parents aren't involved are the ones who need the extra attention the most.  
R:  That's a good point.  Yeah, my friend sells, uh -- I was, uh, talking with them about how, [SIGH] uh, expensive it is to put their kids through school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They said like a nickel and dime expense.  Like every time they -- they have to pay for this, they have to pay for that and it -- you know, when they were kids they didn't have to do that so it's really --
L:  Right.
R:  -- quite, um -- quite an expense and not always sure what to expect.  Oh, well, you know, this year they have to pay for this but last year they didn't and so how to -- how to deal with that.
L:  We're -- we're trying something different this year.  I'm actually the treasurer of the PTA.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And on registration day when everybody comes and, you know, pays for lunches and fills out the emergency cards and signs up for band, whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  All that's been done for the first time, the principal is asking, you know, like each family to donate like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- two hundred and fifty dollars or something.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And then eliminate the nickel and diming throughout the year.  It'd just be a --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- one time, up front --
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  That's what some of the sch- -- yeah, some of the schools here in California have done that.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's worked very well.
R:  Great.
L:  And part -- part of the money, what they're trying to do is to save, uh, the person who runs the library because they've just modernized --
