R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, this is --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- [inaudible] and who are you?
R:  Um, say -- say your name again?
L:  Who?
R:  Is -- say your name again please?
L:  Oh, okay, ah, and I'm in -- living in Washington DC area.  Where do you live?
R:  Um, my name's Danni Holt, I -- I live in San Mateo, just south of San Francisco.
L:  Wow, across the country.
R:  Yeah, definitely, quite an interesting program.
L:  Yes.  Ah, let's see, our topic today is affirmative action and how we feel about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, I'm all for it to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up to a point.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah?
L:  And yours?
R:  How -- how do you mean, up to a point?
L:  Well, I'm not for totally ignoring qualifications.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I am for skewing the results a little bit in for race, ah, or whatever consideration.
R:  Mhm, right, right.  Yeah, that -- that's, ah, more or less how I feel about it too, because I -- I -- I think, even now, you can still see kind of the old boy network in action and, you know, peoples', ah, you know, sons or, y- you know, college room mate's son or brother or whatever --
L:  Well --
R:  -- you know, seem to -- seem to get advantages and so you want to -- you want to, you know, give -- give some ways in to people who don't necessarily have all those ties to the power structure.
L:  Right, I feel the -- a weigh- -- a weighted average sort of thing, not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- overwhelming, but a -- a weighted sort of thing, ah, to give --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the qualified person, who may just miss a little bit.  On --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the other hand, I feel that promotions have never, ever stand on merit anyway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so what difference does it make if we promote people who are unqualified now versus before, we had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- always promoted unqualified people before.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  If it -- they think else wise, just take a look.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Right, it -- it's almost always who you know and not what you know.
R:  Right.  Um, did you hear about the, ah, Supreme Court decision the other day?
L:  Yes, yes, yes.  Ah, I was, um, well, I -- I -- I s- -- Sandra Day sort of, ah, ruled her day, sort of --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] she was the deciding vote on, hm, well, not the other issue, that was six to three so it didn't matter to much, but on that, ah, particular issue, and she surprises a lot of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- surprises me sometimes too, 'cause I always thought she was conservative but, you know, she has sense.  Ah, gotten under, away from Rehnquist's, ah, wings sort of.
R:  Yeah, I mean, she's not nearly as conservative as, ah, Scalia or Clarence Thomas and --
L:  Oh my god, forget them.
R:  -- yeah, well I w- -- I was, ah, reading an article in the Washington Post talking about how Sandra Day O'Connor often is the swing vote and she seems to be the one most representing kind of like, you know, where --
L:  The American way.
R:  -- the -- yeah, the middle of the American people are and so, you know, kind of, whatever, you know, if you took like an opinion poll, whatever the majority opinion was, that's where she's likely to come down and, of course, some people criticize her 'cause they think she's just like kind of trying to go along with what- whatever she thinks most people are likely to want as opposed to whatever --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she thinks that the best argument is on the strength of the law.
L:  I don't really feel that way.  I think basically I feel she is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, ah --
R:  They just said, kind of, ah, ah, you know, a middle of the road kind -- somewhat on the conservative side but --
L:  Yeah, I think that's the way she is, I don't think she's catering to anybody.  Why should any Supreme Court cater to anybody?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they're appointed for life.  They can't get 'em out.
R:  Right, right.  But it -- I think some of them like to see themselves sort of shaping history and, you know, shaping opinions that people are going to live with, and --
L:  Well, they do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it saddens me that we have a Republican president who's been appointing some more clerks and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- justice, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that upsets me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, there was a lot of commentary about how at the end of the -- the term earlier this week none of them announced their retirement and I have a feeling some of the -- the more elderly liberal judges feel like, you know, they're -- they're gonna been taken out feet -- feet first.
L:  Well, they should, they should hang in there.
R:  You know, hold on as long as they can.
L:  That's the way I feel about it, because, ah, there's, particularly the abortion issue and everything is so tied up in this, ah, it would -- I would be -- it would be very sad if we go back to where we were in the nineteenth century.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think we have gone a long way, but we are still in danger and I -- I'm not a Republican, I'm more of an independent actually, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm a Conservative monetary but I'm, ah [LAUGH] progressive social wise [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so what's your politics?  Is it -- you sort of sound like me.
R:  Ah, but I -- I think I'm more just a traditional Democrat, um, but, y- you know, I mean, I've -- I've known, you know, people of good will are like, you know, a real wide ideological spectrum, so, you know, I -- I mean I -- I -- I -- I figure, you know, people are going to think whatever they think regardless of, you know, how -- how strongly someone else feels differently about stuff.
L:  Yeah, absolutely right.  They close their ears to everything else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that doesn't, ah, confirm they're with that -- what their opinion is, but there are some people who will swing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one way or the other.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You can talk to me, you can convince me one way or the other but it would be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pretty tough to.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, speaking of the Supreme Court I'm -- I'm sure you heard about the -- the six to three vote on the other, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- whether sodomy can be made illegal or not, and that pretty much directly overturns the decision they made in nineteen eighty six, which is interesting, ah, you know, I mean, that in eighty six they had, in fact, a fair number of the same judges and they said, you know, yes it is allowable for the state to make sexual behavior illegal if they think they have good reasons for it.  And now on pretty much the same issue they're saying no, in fact, we were wrong before.
L:  Well, I sort of agree with their current opinion.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, but, I mean, it's -- it, you know, it must be difficult, y- you know, I mean, going through all the laws and, you know, first you found a bunch of legal arguments that apparently convinced nine of them the other way seventeen years ago, and now to be looking at th- the exact same issue and coming up with a bunch of other arguments, and I think in some cases, you know, wh- whether for or against, a lot of unwritten arguments about, you know, just because we think so, you know, either that we just sort of like --
L:  Well you have -- seventeen years ago you have different, ah, people up in the courts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's why I'm concerned, because right now so many, ah, of the more liberals are older and, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know Bush is not gonna appoint any [inaudible] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the only reason why, ah, Clinton appointed some not so conservative is because that was the only way he can get the, ah, congress to listen, ah, to vote on his appointments --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that's why I say, "Bull", when th- -- you know, the argument, now they say about this current judge, how, you know, tha- -- he deserves a hearing.  I said, "Well, hell, half of, ah, three quarters of Bush appointees never did get a hearing, so why --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- should these people get a hearing".  [LAUGH]
R:  Bush appointees you mean, or Clinton appointees?
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know, during -- wa- -- it wasn't any, ah, Supreme Court but during his presidency --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about almost fifty percent of the appoint- -- ah, the Courts -- the lower position Courts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- went unfilled because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- congress would not listen.  In other words --
R:  Okay, are you talking about Bush or Clinton?
L:  Clinton, I meant Clinton.
R:  I got a, oh okay, I got a little confused there.
L:  Under Clinton, a lot of the, um, ap- -- you know, appointees were never even heard because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the, ah, congress senate refused to listen to it.  They --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- refused to listen because they didn't want his appointees.
R:  Right, right, I remember that.
L:  Right, and, ah, I -- so now, with the Supreme Court, ah, appointed that nobody else has gotten in, I'm not gonna name -- nobody listened, the argument was it's the President's ap- appointee, he has a right to be heard, I say --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "Bull", [LAUGH] the democr- -- the republicans started this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- up until Clinton everybody got heard, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- since, you know, he came in, you know, none of -- particularly none of his appointees -- it's -- it's not that they was so liberal either, he says, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they just hated Clinton so much, like they --
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's not like Souter and Ginsburg have been, you know, big time, you know, left wing liberals or anything.
L:  Well, it's big time according to these people, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's all relative all right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  These people would think anybody who is not, ah -- ah, a what, a die hard co- conservative are liberal and, ah -- oh well, I -- I guess we'll live through it.
R:  Mhm.  Well, if you live in Washington DC you must really follow a lot more of the national affairs.
L:  We were supposed to be talking about -- oh god, we got off the subject.  Yeah, I used to do a lot of lobbying.
R:  Oh, no --
L:  Um.
R:  -- kidding.
L:  Yes, ah, I do -- I did a lot of, ah, volunteer lobbying --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for woman's issues naturally.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So, I am, ah, quite a bit versed on a lot of these subjects --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and affirmative action is one subject that we, ah, lobby on forever I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lot of the issues that we had to lobby on were actually, per- ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- supported by Reagan, Eisenhower and all these other republicans beforehand [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- until the, ah, congress got so di- -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so let's say, two party.
R:  Uh-huh, partisan, you mean?
L:  Ah, yeah, par- -- you know, it -- it wasn't.
R:  Eh, yeah, it was sort of rigid in their -- in that, you know, polarized and rigid.
L:  Well, yeah, and part of this is due to religion.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, I've -- that's why I think it's -- religion is bad, because of all these, ah, polarization it creates.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You're either with us or you're not with us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That type of deal.
R:  Yeah, definite- --
