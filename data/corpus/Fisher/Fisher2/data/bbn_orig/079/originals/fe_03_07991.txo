L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Sabina Darby, and I'm --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- from Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Oh, you're in New York?  I'm in Massachusetts.
L:  Oh.
R:  My name is Sharon.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you think about the, um -- the topic?  I like going to the movies.  
R:  I --
L:  I don't go that often.
R:  Me too.  I like --
L:  So --
R:  -- going as well, it's just so expensive.
L:  I know.  It's very expensive.  I like to rent the movies, it much -- much easier, but sometimes you could just go to the library and you could take it out for a week and you don't got to pay anything.
R:  That's true --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but even at Blockbusters --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with -- do you have Blockbusters where you live?
L:  Yes.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah, they have na- -- movies now where you can keep 'em for a week if it's not the first run movies.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Have you -- have you seen that yet?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I've seen it, but I don't really -- even then they're expensive, you know, the movies there.  It used to be like a dollar, two dollars, now it's like, I don't know, like three something, four something to rent it.
R:  Well, if you have kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or grandchildren or anything, my, um, -- my -- the kids rent free certain days of the week --
L:  Oh.  Oh, I didn't know.
R:  -- so, yeah, so --
L:  I didn't know that.  I gotta ask them.
R:  So, [LAUGH] -- so, yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but you can find movies that are, you know, not just cartoons, like something that you'd like -- like an adult would like, and they'll still let you rent it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and keep it for a -- a week.  It's great.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I do -- I do love going to the movies, I think as a treat, but then after you buy like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- popcorn and soda [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you coulda gone out to dinner.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I know, I know.  And if you have -- if you go without the kids, even for like a babysitter for like you and your husband to go out, my god, it's like a hundred dollars you've spent with the babysit- -- the babysitter and then the movies and whatever, it's crazy.
R:  Oh, it is.  I agree.  Definitely.
L:  You know, I'd rather go away for a weekend if I'm going to spend --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a hundred dollars.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But on the other hand too, I have like --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- um, the -- the ba- -- the downside of renting movies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the ones you can rent for a week, I forget about 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I'm so used to bringing them back like the second or third day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I've ended up running up extra charges --
L:  [MN] Oh.
R:  -- by forgetting to bring them back.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You do that at the library too, though.  Even though you don't have to pay, you use your library card, but if you don't bring it back in a week, they charge you like two dollars a day, and that --
R:  No kidding?
L:  -- happened to me one time too, and my husband was all upset you know, so like I didn't take anymore out for a while because we had a big argument over two dollars --
R:  Oh.  [MN]
L:  -- but, you know, like I forgot, I can't remember everything.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that was like the first time that ever happened, he never let me forget it.
R:  Oh.  Oh, give it up.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But you were saying --
R:  Did you just --
L:  -- that Blockbuster, like one day a week, you don't know what day it is, the children take it out for free?
R:  Well, I think they can take them out like -- oh, like it may be all the time or either Tuesday, Monday through Thurs -- I can't remember the days, it's not the weekends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm sure it kind of goes like that.  
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I've never heard -- 
R:  I wish I --
L:  -- of that before.  I don't know, maybe they don't have it here, but I'll ask the next time I go to Blockbuster I'm going to ask.
R:  Yeah, they do -- they do have some- -- they do.  I just can't remember, because we've only did it a couple of times because I keep forgetting that we can do it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] and, um --
L:  We- --
R:  -- I was just wondering with the, um, like ones you take out of the library, do they have good ones to select from?
L:  Yeah, they do, um --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- ah, well, the last two that I rented was, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, the last two that I took out was, um, [LIPSMACK] um, [LIPSMACK] As Good As It Gets, with Jack Nicholas -- Nicholson.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, that was good --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- I saw it.
L:  -- that one and, um -- and the other one I took out, I just took out Moulin Rouge, with Nicole Ki- --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that one.  Well, they have some musicals -- they finally put it in alphabetical order, I mean, because before, they didn't have it in alphabetical order -- order, you had to look through every single one, but then when I was there last week, it was finally in alphabetical order so it's a little bit easier, so, you know, I look through it, and you know, I mean -- I mean, they don't have like if you go to a video store, as much as them, but they -- I would say they have about a hundred, you know --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  -- and they do get, like every couple of months they'll get a bunch new in.  They don't know, it's not like a regular cycle, it's whenever they get it, but every couple of months, so, you know --
R:  Yeah, but [SIGH] --
L:  -- I just go there and I look.
R:  Have you noticed at Blockbusters too, remember how they used to have the video tapes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they were easier to see and find --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now they have all the DVDs and they seem to be, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, I mean, you can still find them, it just is that they're thinner and if they have them in one of them, um -- [LIPSMACK] you know when they try to like have them in their -- [SIGH] they sell 'em --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- they just throw 'em in a stack and you can't read 'em --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you just got to pick 'em --
L:  I know.
R:  -- so you don't know what you're getting.
L:  I hate that.  I hate when they do that.  But, what was the last movie you went to see?
R:  I went and jus- -- I just saw the one with, um, Jim Carey, um, Bruce the Almighty.
L:  Oh, how was it?
R:  It was really good.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  I did expect that it was gonna be a little bit better, I mean it was really, really good, but, you know, it's one of those types of movies that they show the good parts on the previews.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What about yourself?
L:  I went to see Anger Management with Jack Nicholson.  Did you see that one?
R:  How was that?
L:  and, um -- and m-, what was his name, Sandlaw? Ah, Larry --
R:  Adam Sandler.
L:  Yeah, Adam Sandler.  Yeah, he was in that.  It was all right --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, you know, I -- I -- I don't know, it was mostly about he had to counseling and then he found out that the guy was in charge of the counseling, he had just had an argument with him.  Now this guy, Jack Nicholson, was in charge of the counseling, he was the counselor and he had a big argument with Adam Sandler before he knew then he told him, "Well, you have to go to, ah, you know, this -- you have to go to this place, and you have to go there", and he walks in and he sees the guy, and he's like, "Oh, my god", you know, "I can't believe you're the -- you're the counselor", cause he had a big argument with him and stuff.  So, yeah, it was funny in that way, but, you know, not what I thought it was going to be.  Not as funny as I thought it was going to be.
R:  I saw the reviews on that.  They said it wasn't that good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But, the Bruce Almighty I guess they're saying, you know, I mean, it was your typical, um, [LIPSMACK] what did I just say his name was [LAUGH], your typical, um --
L:  Ah, Jim Carey movie.
R:  Yeah.  Your typical, you know, like he had, of course, his -- his million faces, and --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- the way that he, you know, like joked and everything.  That was all incorporated in it, so it was kind of a funny way of looking at god, and it made you kind of think about, "What if?"
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was kind of scary, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I see like the commercial for that, like I guess when I seen Anger Management they were showing, you know, that one, and it was all about and, um, [LIPSMACK] Morgan Fair- -- what this guy, no Morgan?  What was his name?
R:  Oh, I can't, yeah the black --
L:  Was god and stuff.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, it was great.  I thought that was perfect putting a black man in the position of god.
L:  Yeah, it was funny.  Did you ever see that All in the Family, when Archie got drunk and he got locked in the basement, and he was drinking.  He found the -- he found the, ah, liquor and he started drinking and he was all drunk and stuff, and he was like, "Get me out of here.  Get me out of here."  Then he thought he died, and he was like laying there, and he thought was going -- going to heaven --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and then the -- their black neighbor came over, that black guy, remember?
R:  Oh, Morgan Freeman, that's his name.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't -- no I didn't see that one, and I used to watch that.
L:  Yeah, well -- well, he was saying, "Help.  Come and get me.  Come and get me."  And he was saying, "Who -- is that you Archie?"  And he was like, "God, is that you?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He was like, "Huh?"  And he was saying, "Come and get me, I'm ready.  I'm ready."  And when he come down the steps he was black.  That black -- his black neighbor.
R:  Oh, that would freak him out, yeah.
L:  And he was like, "Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were black.  I would of never --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- said all the things I said about black when I was alive."  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's a great example of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, how people can be bigots in this world, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just because the majority, you know, there's a good majority of white people, it doesn't mean that there --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- may be somebody else upstairs that we picture, you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I wouldn't be surprised if god played a joke on that.  Like the people that hated blacks as much, or the people that hate Chinese, or hate Jewish people, when they go up there, he ju- -- he comes as a Jewish guy or something, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It's really, [SIGH] --
L:  I'm sure he must have a sense of humor.
R:  That's why it good, if you get -- good to see this movie, it really is.  Because it also turns on another facet of, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- like he's really -- like Jim Carey's supposed to be like this -- he's a news anchorman and he's been reporting on, you know, like the smaller humdrum daily -- you know, like whatever's going on, like the shitty stories I guess you'd say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he wants to, um, make it big as the anchorman that sits on the TV --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so his whole life is consumed by trying to get this position --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he's ignoring -- it's ignoring what's important to him, you know -- he's you know, living with a girlfriend and he keeps ignoring her, and, you know, it's all -- it's got like a double edged sword to it as far as, you know, learning how to be humble and not be so selfish in your life.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And he's that -- that girl from Friends is in it, right?
R:  Yeah.  She's his girlfriend.
L:  A- a- -- Jennifer.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Jennifer Aniston.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've seen the -- I've seen the commercial that he -- she was saying that, "My boobs look bigger.  Do they look bigger to you?" and he must --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- of -- I guess he must of did something to 'em.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Put it this way, he becomes god for a little while.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You got to see it, it is adorable.
L:  Yeah, I could imagine -- I could imagine.  He's funny in -- in, you know, some of the movies that he does.  I didn't like him so much in Mask.  I seen him in the Mask --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I didn't like him so much in that.
R:  Oh, god, my daughter had -- when we first got that damn thing, she kept watching it over and over --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and over and over --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, ah --
L:  It was funny when the dog got it on his face, [inaudible].  Did you ever see it, that -- when the dog was running around with the mask on his face?
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a good movie as well.  I think he -- I think he -- he does pretty well, but god you can tell, you know, it's him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I like -- like say the Grinch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with all the make up [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they put on him.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He just -- jus- just with his personality you cannot like mistake Jim Carey.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Really --
L:  Yeah, he's a good -- he's a very good actor.  I don't know if you've ever seen him when he goes on Oprah and stuff, he cracks her up every time --
R:  Yeah, I have.
L:  -- when she's trying to talk and she can't even talk because he'll be constantly saying all these jokes and she's just like cracking up.  But she laughs at everything though.  [LAUGH]  Do you ever notice, you watch her and --
