R:  Hello.  Hello.  Hello, anybody there?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, this is Mike calling.
L:  Hi, this is Yoki.
R:  Yeah, we're talking about affirmative action at work.
L:  Yeah?
R:  How do you feel about it?
L:  Uh ... [PAUSE] [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, hello.
R:  Hi, this is Mike.
L:  Hi, this is, uh, Yoki.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Very good, how are you?
R:  Excellent.  I hear we're supposed to talk about affirmative action at work.
L:  Uh, what?
R:  Affirmative action at work.
L:  +Affirmative?
R:  Af- affirmative action.
L:  Oh, affirmative action.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  How do you feel about it?
L:  Um, I don't really sure what that means, actually, why don't you tell me first, then maybe I will comment --
R:  Okay --
L:  -- on that.
R:  -- well, what they mean by affirmative action is that, um, they give priority to people of different, you know --
L:  Oh, I --
R:  -- such as --
L:  -- see, oh that's --
R:  -- you know, such as --
L:  -- the one that's hot news, right?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  That's the one that's, uh, quite a hot news right now, right?
R:  Yes, it is, right.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, the Supreme Court just made a ruling on it the other day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, how do you feel about that?
L:  It's like, well, actually it's like a good racist, right?  Don't you think?  Because --
R:  Well --
L:  -- someone is like, of some race and they have, like, special privilege --
R:  Right.
L:  -- right, but this is for tho- those who are, like, before are not, um, being, um, taken for a -- care of and people like that --
R:  Yeah, you --
L:  -- or being --
R:  -- could say that, yeah.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  So --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I th-
R:  -- I --
L:  -- uh-huh.
R:  -- go ahead.
L:  Okay, I think that in a way it's good, because you give more opportunity for them, right?
R:  Yes, that's --
L:  W-
R:  -- true.
L:  Oh, okay, how about you?  What do you think about that?
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm against it.
L:  You're against it? [NOISE]
R:  I'm against affirmative --
L:  Why?
R:  -- action at the workplace, and I'll tell you why.  Where -- where I was bor- I'm a -- I'm a minority, here in this country --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- where I was brought up is that you work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean if you bust your butt and you work like you're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- supposed to work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything will fall in line and take care of itself --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't believe in handing out special favors because the color of your skin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or so forth and so on, I'm entirely against that.  I believe in the old work ethic, if you work hard enough and you -- you do your job, everything will come to you like it should and if it doesn't, well, you go look for somewhere else.
L:  Uh, that's a problem, if you don't have -- I think I'm for it, because, uh, there are places that not taking some kind of races of some kind of, um, origin and that's not nice --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- and because of this law they will be required to hire some race or some origin, like they --
R:  Well, think --
L:  -- have to --
R:  -- think of it -- think of it the other way, [MN] take the other point, I -- and I agree what you're saying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but when you have a -- well, say, um, a vice president's job has opened up in the company, okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you have -- you have, like, say, eight different people who put in for the position who work there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they've been there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for years and they work very, very hard --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for their boss --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they can put in for that vice president job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now, instead of the people at the workplace getting it, they'll go outside because they're required to have so many blacks, so many Latinos and so many Hispanics --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then they'll go outside and pick someone out of that group in order to be in that position of the vice president.  I think that's wrong, because you've had people there who are established, they've worked hard, they've been loyal, they've done their job, they're excellent employees, but they don't get the opportunity because affirmative action and I think that's wrong.  If you -- like I said, if you work hard, I think he or she should get that position and I do believe that strongly instead of affirmative action, I -- I disagree with that, I really do.
L:  Okay, I agree with you if you're looking at it like that way, but on the other hand, like, maybe there is some, like, university that, um, um, they have, like, because of this new law they have to accept some percentage of maybe some races for the students --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you look at it that way, I think that's, like, giving them more opportunity than right now, maybe because it's, like, a more expensive school and they're not taking some, um, is that the same?  Is that the same?
R:  Uh, yes, you're right --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, like a -- like -- like, li- I look on the other side of it, since you brought up the students --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what about the student who -- who's gone to school and stays after school at the library and studies real hard, passes all the tests, is a good student at home, um, activities as well as at school and doesn't get the opportunity to go to college because another -- because of an- minority took his place instead of him taking the place because he earned it.  He had good scores and everything else and he's left out in the cold.  Is that right?
L:  Huh, you're good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, that's true, too, but still, on the other hand, I think it's good having a law that requires, um, maybe 'cause not everybody, like, have, uh, maybe, like, okay, for your, uh, from your [NOISE] example, [LAUGH] from your example, um, someone is working very hard to get a promotion, but because of this, uh, law maybe they are, um, the promotion is given to another people based on the race or the origins, right?
R:  Right.
L:  But that's, like, not every company is, mm, um, giving, um, evaluation based on work, maybe.
R:  True.
L:  Right, so --
R:  True.
L:  -- having this law is good on the other way, so I don't know, maybe this is like half and half. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree with you, bu- you know, but there's one more problem we have --
L:  What is that?
R:  -- and that's if -- if -- if certain companies, they're like ce- for instance, different government agencies, if they don't have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the proper mix --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- of white and black --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Hispanic and la- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Latino --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the government with withhold monies and the state will withhold money to that certain company because they don't have a mix race --
L:  Mm --
R:  -- in the --
L: -- okay.
R:  -- workplace --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is that right?  I --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- don't think it is.
L:  -- yeah, I don't think that is.  But --
R:  You know, and I understand what y- what you're saying is also correct, you're also -- you also have a good point --
L:  So, this is --
R:  So --
L:  -- what -- okay --
R:  -- so, what do we do?  Where -- where do we make it fair?  How do we make it fair?
L:  Yeah, how do we make it fair?
R:  That's the big question.
L:  Yeah.  So, having this law doesn't solve the problem, right, really?
R:  Well, it -- i- it -- it -- it does because it -- it brings out the problem and I don't know what the solution is, I've got a good idea, but I know there's gotta be a solution out there.  Every problem that we have, there's -- there is a solution.
L:  Mhm, we --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- just have to find it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- we have to find it.  We have to get together as people and find the problem, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- how do we solve this thing about having equal races in the workplace?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm all for it and I think it's great --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I've been in some instances where you have the people that -- that are of the mixed race that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- come into the workplace --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm not picking anybody --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but a lot of the times you find out that s- particular person can't do the job and the only one reason why they're there is because the color of their skin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't think that's right.
L:  Yeah, that isn't, I agree with you, that is not right.
R:  But yet they hire them because they have to have a quota --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's another thing that bothers me is the word "quota", you've gotta have equal amounts of races.  I don't think the quota's right either.  I agree with it to a certain a -- point, but I don't agree with the word altogether, because like I say, I don't think it's right --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I mean, look at women, how they were discriminated for lots of years --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- women weren't allowed to vote, or they weren't allowed to do a lot of things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but with equal ri- they want -- in women, they want equal work for equal pay, right?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That i- I'm all for that, a hundred percent behind that, but once again --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if -- if a male can do the job better than the female and yet at equal rates and so forth and so on, I personally, now, without being prejudiced, I would have to take the male --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I know that he can do the job and he'll --
L:  It --
R:  --he'll --
L:  -- it's not that --
R:  -- get the --
L:  -- he could do --
R:  -- production done.
L:  It's not that the woman cannot do jo- do the job, but maybe because, uh, I don't think I agree with you when you say, "because the man can do the job", the woman can do the job, but maybe there are because, you know, women, maybe they're on -- they're having children, they're having kids, they're having labor and they have to break sometimes off and, uh --
R:  True.
L:  -- why, so it's not like they cannot do the job --
R:  Oh, no, no, no, but what I'm saying is if it were a particular, let's say a particular computer job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that person, or the male person, or whoever it is, the- they know that -- they know the job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, they can get the job done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but instead you bring out somebody from the outside --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to come in and do that job and usually they fall on their face --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- unfortunately.
