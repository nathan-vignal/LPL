L:  Hi, I'm Amelia.
R:  Hi, I'm Cathy.  How are you today?
L:  Very good, thank you.
R:  Good, good.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm calling from Maryland?  Where are you?
L:  I'm New York City.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's a real, er -- actually that's a great topic.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Because, uh, I have a son that's in the public school system.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So, um, and I -- and I live in New York and we've been having a real problem, especially this year.  I don't know if you have the same -- I [MN] -- I think, um, New York is the only one that has the regents.  Have you ever heard of that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] No, I don't.
L:  Yeah, we have regents that the, um [LIPSMACK] kids have to take.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [MN] And in order to, um, graduate from high school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They have to take five, um, regents exams in the, um [LIPSMACK] main subject areas like English and math and all that.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  And this particular, uh, season, they had a -- a regents in June and it was, uh -- it created such a f- a fervor among [SIGH] uh -- because there was such a -- a catastrophe basically.  They made it so, um, er, let's see, so -- so hard --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that the, um -- [LIPSMACK] that the, uh, uh -- up at Albany, New York, where the -- where the Board of Ed is from and where they -- you know, they design all these different tests and everything, they had to investigate it and now they have to -- they've decided that they were gonna throw that test out.  So, it created a lot of problems for the parents, for the kids and so --
R:  Well, I can only imagine.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and what is this, uh, test really used for?
L:  [SIGH] It's, um [SIGH] -- it's supposed to be a standard of achievement.
R:  Oh, okay.  For them to --
L:  The only [MN] -- yeah.
R:  -- move on to the, um, next grade?
L:  To move on -- well, not to move on necessarily -- sit the next grade but to use, um, I guess, uh, to use when they apply to colleges, um --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's -- it's supposed to [MN] set a stand- a standard of, uh, uh -- of quality.
R:  Is it lieu of, or is it in addition to the SATs?
L:  [SIGH] It's -- no, it's -- it's -- it's a separate, entirely different kind of a test.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and -- and -- and it's only in, like I said --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- five subject areas and, um -- but they have to get a sixty five to pass it.  And unless they get that sixty five, they have to keep doing it -- [MN] they have to keep doing it over and over again [SIGH] until they pass it and -- and the sch- school system where I work -- I work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] they -- they've had [MN] [MN] times where the students have failed it numerous times, and therefore, that creates a real problem when they become -- when they start to become seniors because now they're in -- they're in a probl- -- they're in trouble because they don't have that regents exam.
R:  Oh, that's terrible.
L:  It is terrible.  And so, that's -- that created a lot of problems this year.
R:  [NOISE] Right, so how do --
L:  And --
R:  -- people get around that?  Or they don't get around that?
L:  They don't get around it when they're in New York.  They have to take it.  It's, um -- you know, it -- there -- there -- and I think that [MN] what -- what the problem I see is happening is that they are putting the students into a box.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're putting in -- they're -- they're saying that all students should be able to achieve this.  All students are at this level and that's not the way -- as we know now, that's not the way people are.
R:  Well, that's true.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Everyone learns in different ways.
L:  Different ways and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, each student is different.  Each student has their own strengths and abilities.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, um, you know, and that's a real [MN] [MN] -- so, I see that as a real problem.  The solution is, I think, that they need, first of all, to get rid of those kinds of tests. 
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, also if they decide to do that kind of a thing, then I think they need to make it more down to earth and -- and try to make it, um, [SIGH] uh, you know, different levels of those kinds of tests and not just have one test that everybody's supposed -- expected to pass and expected to do well in, you know.
R:  Yeah, that sounds pretty unreasonable, actually.
L:  Mhm.  Now what about your public school systems?
R:  Um, for ours, I don't believe that -- that, um, there is that type of test that's available over here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think mostly, um, on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on our end it's just really -- I -- since I don't h- have a lot of people that are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, [MN] you know, we're in Maryland, of course, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's -- there -- it's just been --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- I guess, pretty much, um, [LIPSMACK] i- it's all been in the news lately about how they're like wanting to strike and how --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- people are --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- you know, are having problems and they're -- you know, it's real hard because when people are getting laid off and then there's been all of this discussion as to like, you know, how much people have made and it's led into a scandal and whatnot.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it -- it kinda gives, you know, [MN] [MN] -- the over look of the school system sort of in a bad light.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know, I -- [MN] with all the lay offs and the way that the economy's being going, or course, you know, it's -- I think that, uh -- they've, uh, taken away from a lot of the schools, a lot of, you know, um, er, classes and things like that.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Where, you know, it [MN] --
L:  So, you've been affected by the, um [LIPSMACK] -- so the economy has also affected the -- the -- the school system there too?
R:  Yeah, pretty much.
L:  With l- lay offs.  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, pretty much.  I mean a lot of people have been laid off and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then, of course, you know you get smaller classes.  Well, actually, bigger classes for a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with a -- with, um, teachers who have to take them all on.  So, it's sort of hard on them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then of course w- I guess, with the rate of pay that they end up getting.  I -- you know, I don't really know what that is but I --
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  -- can only assume that's it's not as much as it w- -- it should be.
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  It --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it becomes, you know, like a really bad thing and then you have all these people that are suffering.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, all these kids and their --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- parents and what not, as a result of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, but as for -- as far as testing or anything like that, I don't think that's anything that I -- either I'm not really aware of.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just been real, you know, prevalent about the scandals within the ...
L:  So -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- then --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there's been a lot of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um -- so then, and basically in -- in your -- in your city and your town in -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in Maryland, there's been a lot of problems with the --
R:  There's --
L:  -- with the school system.
R:  Yeah, there's been --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some and it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just, um, you know -- it's just not nice, you know, to see all of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And especially since, you know, I mean I grew up going to public school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know, at that time you didn't have these kind of things going on.
L:  Right.
R:  It was just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pretty much you go, you take your tests, you --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you move on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You go from grade to grade to grade.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And if, you know -- if there was a strike, it wouldn't be that big of a deal and now of course, I guess, with the media hype and everything else that goes on --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, everything's all blown out of proportion and -- and then, you know, they -- and -- and it's just -- it's just too much -- I think there's just too much, um, [NOISE] um -- too many things that, uh, people, um, try to make, uh, it bigger than it needs to be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like they're talking about the -- the asbestos in the schools.
L:  Right, that's right.
R:  Oh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they go uh, uh, uh.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Then they do like this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- big --
L:  [SIGH] [MN]
R:  -- you know, [MN] ex- -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this whole news story on it and how they're shutting it down and all.  They're doing this and [LAUGH] ...
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, you know, it -- it's just the whole, you know -- it makes the school system look really s- silly.
L:  It does, mhm.
R:  It really does and I -- I don't know. I -- you just look at that and you're like, "Whoa, God, do I really wanna send my kid to --"
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  "-- public school?"
L:  I know.  Mhm.
R:  "Or would I rather, you know, go to a private school and ...?"
L:  Right, mhm.
R:  And then, of course, then you start hearing all the things about, "Oh, what are the, you know --" [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  "-- the pastors doing?  What are the [inaudible] doing?"
L:  Right.
R:  And then --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you'll find out, "What's the nuns doing?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, then, you know -- then, you know, you can't win.  
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you find that the curriculum nowadays with the school system -- the public school system, that it is like kind of, um -- it's very different then, you know -- then mayb- --
R:  Then what it was before?
L:  Before?
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, just because of the -- the way that, you know, everyone is dependant on, um [LIPSMACK] like computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, when I was growing up, pretty much, you didn't really have a computer or if you had a computer, it was something really, you know, you know, turn of the century [LAUGH].  
L:  Right.
R:  You know, really, really old.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know and then you were all -- you were just basically not having anything that went to any kind of speed and there was no Internet.
L:  Oh.
R:  And so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everyone now is --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- required to like, you know, get a computer.
L:  Mhm, that's right, mhm.
R:  You know, so w- w- way back then you didn't have to get anything as much as like a notebook and a pen and a pencil.
L:  That's right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So now, everything -- there's c- -- there comes even more of an expense.
L:  Yes.
R:  To be able to go to school and to go and do things and [MN] you know, and I think that as time wears on and with -- with the way that technology's going, it's gonna cost even more just to have people go to kindergarten.
L:  That's right, mhm.
R:  You know, and just -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just with the way that everything's going right now so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I guess, you know, times change and I guess people need to move with the times so ...
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah.
R: You know, I mean even little kids are, you know, learning computers even like at -- probably in the --
L:  Oh, they --
R:  -- pre-care.
L:  -- oh, they know so much.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And it's hard -- they --
R:  Right and they know a lot more --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- than probably a lot of other people who never, you know, been on computers.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, at least they'll be a lot smarter.
L:  [LAUGH] That's right.
R:  That -- that's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- probably what they're gonna get out of the whole thing.
L:  They have the advantage in that respect.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  Yeah, and with, you know, the way that technology is right now with everyone, you know, being online and chatting --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you know, a- and everything else, you know, it just brings a whole new world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to all these young people which is a good thing.
L:  But, yeah, it is.  It is.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  But, you know, with -- with all the lay offs and with the way the world is right now, you know, and the f- and the funding, it's -- I would think it'd be kinda h- difficult for them to keep up.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yes.  I think too that the, um -- as much hype as they put about, you know, education, uh, you know, uh, for the children and they're --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- putting children first.  I don't see that.  I don't think that that is true and I don't see that really happening because if they really -- really were sincere about wanting a quality education for all children, I think the school sys- -- that they would [MN] revamp the whole school system and they would also, um, be -- be concerned about the classrooms, and the class sizes, and getting enough teachers and -- and all that, and I don't see that happening.
R:  Yeah, y- uh, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it seems that the times really haven't changed as much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, you know, if -- if they cut anything else, they'll cut off --
