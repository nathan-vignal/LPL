L:  Ah, hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, ah my name is Sharon.
R:  Um --
L:  Ah, and you?
R:  I'm Joanne.
L:  Hi, I'm ah I'm in the Baltimore, Maryland area.  Where are you from?
R:  E- I'm from Georgia.
L:  Oh, okay.  Very good.  Um, okay, so we got kind of a hard topic [LAUGH].
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, have you done this before, by the way?
R:  I have.
L:  Yeah, me too.  A couple of times now, but ah it's still, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of a new process.  But, okay, so, are there any countries that you see as a threat to us?  Ah- --
R:  Well, it's kind of obvious [LAUGH].
L:  Well, I mean, I don't -- I guess a- -- the -- my first reaction to that was um that it's not so much the countries that are a threat as it is in the individual terrorist groups and such; you know, they don't seem to operate through --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- their, you know, coun- -- through their governments, but they operate on their own --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so they could be made up from people all over the, you know, all over the world and not from any one distinct country.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know [LAUGH] I -- I -- it's hard because I don't want to stereotype, you know [LAUGH] I don't want to just say the name of a country and, you know, it's not really fair to hold a whole country, you know, at fault for something just a few people ah participate in.  But anyway --
R:  Right.  That --
L:  We have ten minutes --
R:  I know.
L:  -- so I guess we should list some countries [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, okay.  Well, what do you think?
R:  I -- I mean, obviously you have to go with all the stuff that's going on now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in [inaudible] although that is really the actions of just, you know, a couple of handfuls of people --
L:  I get -- right, right.
R:  -- still they are -- were under that leadership.
L:  Right.  And I guess most of the people involved with nine eleven were -- actually turned out to be from Saudi Arabia, but generally I guess just the Middle East, you know, region --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is where a lot of it comes from, it seems, but --
R:  Right.  My topic the other day was talking about nine eleven, actually.
L:  Mine too.  And that was easier than this [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This one's a lot harder.  Actually, that -- that call by the way just turned out to be kind of fun because the person I talked to, we had like ten things in common, in turned out, like we knew you know a mutual person between us, which is kind of funny.
R:  Oh, weird.
L:  Yeah, I know, that -- that it came up and everything, it was kind of strange.  But anyway, um, so I guess again the Middle East region and um I guess even in Europe there are areas, you know, pockets of whatever, groups of people.  Once again I -- not countries, really, it doesn't seem like, but you know, I'm not -- I don't know, I don't -- I'm not an expert, I don't know about you but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, I don't -- I'm ah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I have to say, I'm not very um knowledgeable about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- international affairs, really.
L:  Right.  I mean, I'm -- I'm better about it since all of this started happening, you know, like -- like I've you know started to learn more, I guess, but in generally I'm with you, I'm sort of like very you know, like single focused on, you know, my little world here in the United States and um you know I -- I'll admit that I'm kind of you know, I've always been that way --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- like you don't really think about so much what's going on day to day in every, you know, everywhere else in the world --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you've got enough -- there's enough here [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, the [several inaudible words] main think how impact will it going to be to you either --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean until you have an event like that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then you think, "Oh" you know, that could happen, so --
L:  Yeah, like nine eleven --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, nothing could wake you up quite like that, um --
R:  Right.  I mean, so until then I was like, I know, they're there, we're here, whatever they do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- their thing, we do our thing.
L:  Yeah.  Exc- -- I mean, it seems like they pay more -- much more attention to what we do than we pay attention to them.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  I th- -- well, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, you know, because they have --
R:  They know.
L:  -- all these thing, you know, these slights that they think ah the United States has made against them but you know we're sort of oblivious to that here.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  But anyway --
R:  I -- I think some of the -- I'm -- I'm not real sure about this, but some of the Chinese areas ah are -- are impactful too --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- from what I've been and [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.  Well, China like I mean China is -- has so much potential to be um, you know, potential enemy or because of their size and I mean they're enormous, you know, and growing and -- and you know far bigger than the United States and of course they're you know, not -- not a democratically run country, so I guess, you know, they have sort of a dictatorship and if they get mad at us, that's not good [LAUGH].
R:  They'll just say something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not nice.
L:  Yeah.  And then there's of course um a whole another area, there's -- there's North Korea with, you know, nuclear capacity and I don't know, I -- I'm like really not knowledgeable about this stuff [LAUGH] but ah --
R:  I did not hear the topic.
L:  -- but that's pretty scary.
R:  The -- the phone went to a machine and I did not hear the topic before --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I clicked into the call.
L:  Would you not have -- would you not have picked up if you'd known?
R:  Um, I might not have, just because ah you know ah don't know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot about it.
L:  Right.  Right.  It's almost --
R:  Because I might have waited for another opportunity [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it is a hard topic.  And -- and again it's like not sure I want to say, you know, commit to saying something, you know, if it comes out sounding wrong [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But, oh well [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Um -- so we -- I -- if I m- you don't mind me asking, are we allowed, you know, like only to do three calls, or can we do more, do you know?
R:  [SIGH] I understood three, but this is like another phase of it, they had a phase --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- back at the first of the year and I -- I'm not sure would -- if you were involved at that phase you get three more or --
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So, I mean, so I mean, if they call again, I guess, because this is my third, but I didn't know.  I guess if they call and I pick up, I'll just assume it's okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- because you'll be in their system for that, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.  Ah --
L:  Okay.  So, does anyone e- does anyone else hate us?  Let's see [LAUGH].
R:  Does what?  Ah --
L:  Does anyone else hate us?
R:  Does anybody else hate us?
L:  Yeah.  I'm trying to make -- stay back on topic.
R:  Ah, I think --
L:  But um -- um --
R:  Probably.
L:  We've named them, some of the biggies, but ah -- um, there's probably plenty others [LAUGH].
R:  Um, I mean y- I guess --
L:  I mean, I guess any country with a, you know, run by a dictatorship --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- potentially um could be an enemy, although it doesn't necessarily mean that they have the capacity to do anything about it, you know.
R:  They're just more vulnerable to that um -- they're just a little bit more vulnerable to the p- -- to one person telling them what to do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, just following more in line to you know what one person's w- or a handful of people's wills are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know versus a democracy like this that um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] anybody could, at any time --
L:  And --
R:  -- just get all mad and do whatever they want.
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  And I guess like any country that we're involved in militarily like, you know, even in Japan we still have troops and stuff that potentially you know that we could offend them, you know, because ah because of our presence --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I don't know.  [LAUGH] I'm sort of scraping for stuff, here, but um -- and who knows like what's going on in South America?  We've totally skipped that continent, but I don't really know what's going on there.  A lot of -- a lot of unrest --
R:  What is the one I'm thinking about --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- the um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is it ah Bolivia?  No, not Bolivia.  Um --
L:  Colombia, or Venezuela --
R:  Oh --
L:  I don't know, there's like lots of --
R:  As- --
L:  -- uprisings and -- and coups and all these things that I don't know the origins of, you know, why they're fighting or anything.
R:  Yeah, I seen something on TV a while back about this guy who was doing a motorcycle ride across somewhere and got held prisoner or hostage, whatever --
L:  Yikes.
R:  -- um in one of those South American countries and I thought "Whoa" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think it was drug related but I -- they were talking about how dangerous that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- area was --
L:  Yeah.  Even parts, you know, Mexico, too, I mean, you know, it's our neighbor and ah bad things, you know, have happened to Americans there as well.
R:  Right.  Now, I've been to Mexico and --
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  -- of course I went to r- you know, for fun and resort areas, but --
L:  Right.  Right.  Touristy stuff.
R:  Touristy stuff.  But yeah, that's not, I mean can't be that big a deal, they could get into the tourist area, too.
L:  Yeah.  And I've actually been to Israel, but I went like a long time ago when it wasn't all scary [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like I would never go now.  But um -- but I did go when I was ah -- when I was a teenager.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  That is a lot more, you know, and that's unfortunate too that you can't go and do -- do that Israeli --
L:  Right.
R:  -- tour without a lot of --
L:  Oh, now.  My goodness.
R:  -- pre thought.
L:  Yeah, um, but even then when I went they were very strict about security and stuff.  Um, you know, because our country has always been a target --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- since it, yeah, since it -- whatever.  Since we became a country.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  Anyway, um --
R:  I had um -- I heard about this the other day, [several inaudible words] a country being a threat, but this lady in -- she lived in Florida, I think, w- she was Muslim or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she went to go have her driver's license picture taken and she has the --
L:  Oh, the --
R:  -- what do you call, the head thing?
L:  -- the veil?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she didn't take it off and then they t- -- they sent her things that she ha- you know, she had to go to jail or something or what.
L:  I -- that's what it was, yeah.  I -- I saw a like some reference to that, but I didn't know exactly what the story was, but yeah, I guess, I mean I know um --
R:  She says it was against her religious beliefs, but --
L:  Right.  Right.  Some states I guess allow them to wear the little, the head coverings --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I guess not in the State she was trying to get her license, so --
R:  It's believable.  I believe it was Florida.
L:  Florida or somewhere, yeah.
R:  I -- I think so.  It's -- it's something like in some place I thought should be more progressive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Than that.  But um -- and I was like, well, you know, I guess in her you know, and I know she lives here, but in her -- she still has to honor that
