R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's Joshua Polston from San Francisco, California.
L:  And my name is Susan and I'm from Saint Louis, Missouri.
R:  Hi, Susan.  How ya doing?
L:  I'm doing good.
R:  Good.  So, the topic is computers and education.
L:  Mhm.  And, actually, I think computers in education is a great source of education.
R:  Mm.
L:  There's -- there's a lot of different ways that you can -- you -- you can self teach yourself with a computer.  You can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do a lot of courses that way instead of having -- sitting in front of a classroom and having an instructor go on and on and on.  You could do it self paced.
R:  Right. [PAUSE] Yeah, I've --
L:  I --
R:  -- I've done some -- the only type of computer class I've ever really, um, gone through was one that, ah, allowed me to, ah, avoid having to sit through six hours of driver education after I got a speeding ticket.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I was very happy about the fact that I could sit there, at home, you know, in the middle of the night, when I chose, ah, you know, sitting there, sipping a beer, and read through all the stuff and answer questions and -- and complete the course without having sit in a classroom.
L:  Well, that -- that's true.  And -- and a lot of them are, they're -- they're self paced so, you know, it may take you a half an hour to do something where, you know, it may take me in two and half hours.
R:  Right.
L:  So, a lot of 'em, you can do at your own pace and, like you said, you can do it when you have the time to do it.
R:  Yeah, I mean something that -- [NOISE] I dunno if you, ah, you know, what field you work in, but if you've taken many live training classes, especially for computers, you know, using basic spreadsheets and databases and things like that, um, but I would think that computer courses would do well in that kinda situation 'cause I know my frustration, in going to those types of classes, is that the, you know, the weakest link always breaks the chain, and you always feel that either the class is going too fast or, usually, too slow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it -- it just takes one person to say that, "Oh, you know, how do you click your mouse?" and the whole class comes to a stop.
L:  Right.  Er, yeah, and I've gone through all of that too.  But we've had, like, different levels of computer training.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, as -- as far as that goes but even though you are -- might be in an advanced class, you have -- still have somebody in there that doesn't belong there.
R:  Sure.  
L:  And it does, it takes -- it takes a lot more time because you have to wait for that other person to get caught up.
R:  Right.
L:  Sometimes they catch it and sometimes they don't.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that seems to me, in terms of adult learning, where, um, they're very applicable, you know, type of computer class.  And there's a whole another issue when it comes to kids learning on the computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the role that they can play.  And, ah, I -- I don't have any kids though, I'm going to have some very soon, um, but it seems like a lot of the, ah, the computer, well, games and things for kids have really taken huge strides in the past couple of years.  And they're much more sophisticated and really, um, challenge kids.
L:  And, actually, kids do learn a lot from the computer because they're animated games.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they still learn from 'em and I -- I have two kids and they play a lot of computer games.  They're educational games --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they still learn because they're -- they're like a game and they can go at their own pace.
R:  Right.
L:  And they learn the basics of the computer itself, you know, how to click on it and -- and how to move around, which obviously I didn't learn until a later age but they already know how to go through the computer and do all of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, a lot of the games, slash, education is good for kids.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, the only down side, of course, is that, ah, if you look at the trend that kids are essentially becoming couch potatoes and all of, you know, while computers are great and of, ah, active attendant[?] and much -- certainly much more, ah, mentally stimulating than, ah, television, they're still sitting inside and not running around on the street and playing on swings and doing the kinda things that kids need to do to, you know, burn off calories, [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Right.  And, actually, I -- I -- I guess where I come from, I -- I guess I don't have to worry about that.  Kids -- my kids they -- they do both.
R:  They do?
L:  I mean, there's -- there's a time for them to sit in front of the computer and learn and a time to go out and run off their energy.
R:  And, as a parent, do you have to be pretty strict about, ah, regulating their time?
L:  Not really.  You know, actually, I don't.  In, really, the games that they learn, it's -- it's easier for the parent because you don't have to be constantly there with them the whole time.  You know, even the education ones that, um, the reading, the computer reads the story for them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And they -- they can read the story as it goes along too.  So, they're learning how to read and that's something that takes away, I guess, from the parent or a teacher doing that, too, with the kid.
R:  Right.  That --
L:  You know, that -- that's when, you know, a lot of times, parents don't have time to sit there for an hour and read books and teach you different things about, you know, reading.  So, I mean, they do learn a lot from the computer.
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  I don't think that I would consider them couch potatoes because of it.  Some kids, yeah, but I -- I guess my kids, no.
R:  Mhm.  You know, probably it -- it happens later on when , you know, especially you hear about, um, you know, teenage boys that are just very obsessive with all these video games and -- and multi level or multi player computer games where there are whole kinda -- a, you know, kinda sub culture going on where they can play with friends all over the -- the country or the world, but, ah, you know, the upshot is, they're still sitting in front of a computer on a nice day and -- and playing, you know, Blow 'Em Up or whatever they're doing.  
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, and -- and I know, too, that even as an adult, where it's the computer based training that --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- after you've gone through it, 'cause anybody can click to go on and on and on just to complete a course, but to have, like, some kind of an exam that goes after it.  You know, to see that you really retained or even got anything out of the training.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause a lot of people can just click until they get to the end and then they're done.  You know, as -- as far as if it's a requirement for something else.
R:  Right.  Well, there's, ah, there's something like that at my work where we have, ah, a time accounting system that is all web based.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we have to log in every day and put down our hours for different, ah, clients and accounts.  And to basically get to the next level of reviews, or every year when you go ahead in front of, ah, your partner or your boss, you basically have to go through an online training course to show that you know all of the requirements of the, ah, the billing policy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  As well as the, ah, time recording policy.  And they do, very much, like that they -- they give you some information and it's a constant test in that information and -- and quiz, to where, at the very end, you, um, you know probably more than you really want to know [LAUGH] but also, you know probably more -- much more than you would if you just sat through a live presentation.
L:  Right.  Because, I mean, the computer based training you can stop at any time.  And when you're sitting in front of, you know, in a classroom or someone's giving you a presentation, that could be the most boring person, you know.  
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and they lose interest.
R:  Right.
L:  When you do it on a computer and you do it at your own pace, it's like, if you have to get up and go run, you know, a mile and a half and come back to it, you can do that.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, if you wanna go out to lunch, you can go do that and come back and do your training.  'Cause I think if you do it when you want to do it, you're going to get more out of it --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- than to have to go at a certain place, at a certain time.
R:  No, absolutely.
L:  And I haven't -- I haven't gone through any training in a long time as far as computer, but, yeah, I mean, you -- you learn every day as you work on it.
R:  Mhm.  And also, I mean, I find that, ah, even though I spend a lot of time bemoaning, ah, Bill Gates, that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- even just when working on a lot of the Microsoft function, if you just hit F one, and use the kinda built in help, or it's really a training function --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, it -- it's -- it's pretty good.  It -- and it usually, you know, eighty percent of the time you can usually get your answer.  Or figure out how to do what you're trying to do and, ah, you know, 'cause a lot of the computer, of course, you can often get the end result but, ah, the art is, of course, doing it the quickest way possible.
L:  Right.  And I think they're -- there are a lot of, like, different Microsoft tools that you can learn to learn as you go.  But as far as training, I know there's a lot of courses that are set up that you just, you know, you just go step by step.
R:  Right.
L:  You might have to go over a certain topic and then you may take a test and then go over another topic and take a test.  Because I -- I've gone through some of that too.  You just have headphones on and you sit there in a, you know, like a classroom library.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you go through the courses like that.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I -- I really, I won't take those types of classes any more, um, with a live presentation.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I've just found that they really are, um, just not the best use of time.
L:  I know.  And -- and a lot of it does boil down to time.  People today are very busy.  They work a full time job, and they still go through, you know, some kinda courses or some training or something and, you know, and if you want to do that at midnight, it's a -- do it at midnight.
R:  Right.
L:  At least you know you can do it.  At -- at -- I think I'd rather have it that way than to be scheduled at, you know, a certain time, three o'clock every day.  I have to go listen to this guy and he just bores me to death.
R:  Right.
