L:  Hi.  My name is Guy.
R:  Hi.  My name is Dan.
L:  Hey, Dan. How're you doing, man?
R:  I'm pretty good.  You?
L:  I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing.
R:  That's good.
L:  Well, uh, Middle East.  All right, um, let's see.  Well, I'm against all violence.  Um, I -- I don't believe that there's a way.  If you're gonna die, you're gonna die but, uh, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't believe that, um, you should take somebody with you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh,  just -- I don't know.  I just don't think that, uh, the resolution -- any resolution's ever gonna be from bombs 'cause quite frankly, somebody's gonna -- you know, like you can bomb only so many people and most likely you're gonna bomb the innocent civilians than you're gonna bomb the actual guys who are the murderers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think the only way you'd be able to get to resolve any issues is -- is essentially by -- by negotiation.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean -- I mean, it's amazing after how many -- how many centuries of evolution we've tried to -- we've tried to succeed and it seems like the greatest country in the world now has to use force in order to get a point across --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which eventually will -- will bring their downfall.  I mean, think about it.  Look at the British Empire.  The only reason why it fell is because of discontent amongst people who were their supporters.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  When a country doesn't -- when a country loses its supporters it loses its power.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm -- I don't know, I just, uh, I don't think that, uh, I don't think it's going to be resolved with bombs.  I think that they should get in there and use their -- I mean, we have the best negotiators in the world.  I mean, we're -- we have a strong -- we're have the strongest company, uh, country.  We have the strongest companies, we have the best negotiators.  We're -- we are the best educated people but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nobody's, um, using it for peace.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  They using it for let's blow up some stuff and oh, yeah, by the way when we're going over there to -- to, uh, liberate the country, let's first focus on the oil wells.  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.  It --
L:  I mean, think about it, I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, there's definite ulterior motives with this war and a lot of special interest in things like that.
L:  And did you know the first billion contract went to an American company?
R:  Yep, actually the one that Chaney used to work for, or used to lead.
L:  Exactly.  Well done.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Not many people realize that though.
R:  Not -- not -- not many.  Not many.  I mean, it's -- it's -- it's in the news.  I mean, but people -- I guess people just really don't pay attention to that.
L:  Don't pay attention.
R:  Yeah.  So, yeah it's --it's definitely not right.  Do -- do you think there will ever be peace in the Middle East?
L:  Yeah.  I think there will be but the negotiators, the biggest -- the focal point would have to be the US.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's so funny but a country that's not involved is the one thing is that -- that is the deciding factor.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, if you took like for instance Is- Israel and -- and Palestine.  Right.  Um, it's -- you know, if CNN was covering it, you know, during the war when, you know -- during the first beginnings of it, you know, when -- when they were bombing and attacking and they took over that area.  Not CNN, it was just basic general news but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as soon as they -- they filmed a, uh [LAUGH] they filmed an Israeli soldier shooting kids, shooting at kids, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they stopped that coverage.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And now it's all -- it's just, you know, about the terrorist bombing or anything.  It doesn't show up like the stories because where there's money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  There -- there's -- my father always said this thing.  He goes, "History was written -- uh, history was only written by the victors --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- so never believe everything you hear".
R:  That's true.  That's true.  I can -- can really believe that, yeah.
L:  And think about it and like God knows the Indians probably have a lot of shit on us [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You won't believe what the white guy did to us, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, but anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I just -- I think we have the capacity of resolving this situation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to give up a lot, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in order to do it and what we don't realize is that by strengthening our environment like in -- in -- in basic like -- let's look in -- uh, wh- wh- what are you -- what are your hobbies by the way?
R:  Um, let's see mostly watching movies and, um, and I like to read.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, and -- and working out.
L:  Oh.  Uh, do you, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what kind of books do you read and are you into like any, um -- what type of workouts are you into?
R:  Uh, I -- I like cardio.  I usually run and do, um, light -- light weights most of the time.  I -- I -- like right now, I'm reading [LAUGH] Harry Potter.
L:  Oh, I love Harry Potter, man.  My wife's right now reading the Prisoner of Azkaban.  After we finish up on that, we're going --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- back to the Goblet of Fire just to get ready for the new book coming out.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's cool.
L:  It's a good book.  I mean -- I -- I -- she's -- she's a phenomenal writer and I realize -- [MN] you're reading Harry Potter?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm like, yeah.  I'm like wh- what other books do you read and I'm like well, you know, basically Richard Green, Quantum Physics, um, Super Strength --
R:  Yeah.
L:  People don't realize that, you know, it's -- it's a good -- she's a good writer.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But the reason I asked was because, you know, people usually know things if they associate it to what they are familiar with.  
R:  Oh.
L:  So, let's say cardio.  When you're -- when you're running, you know that the best way for you to continue running is by breathing deeply and r- rhythmically and -- and basically absorbing whatever, uh, nutrients you have in your blood system.  You're trying to make sure that the ATP and the creatine level, if you're using that, is still in the blood system and you're -- you're also trying to make sure that the more you breathe, the less lactic acid builds up so you don't sore.  Well, you know, you know that this -- these are the steps to do to -- to continue on and be strong in whatever, you know, endeavor you're doing which is running.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, we know as a coun- country that it's -- it's pure strength is based on economic wealth --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the only way to strengthen our economic wealth is by breathing deeply of the environment and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- expelling whatever crap we're using.
R:  Yeah.
L:  the crap that we're using is biased prospectors on which I have to say are based on religion.  Religious --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and economic but more religious than anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because they -- one country is closest to Christianity than the other --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it will take that bias and because, of course, it just shows happens that Israel has a very strong, um, military.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We'll speak for the Is- Israeli side --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- while the Palestinians are the poor guys, the under- the underdogs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The only way we're going to resolve that issue is if we t- put our own money into it and, um, that's gonna suck but [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'd rather not have my kids being bombed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know what I mean?
R:  Well, do you think -- I mean, since the -- the war obviously has -- I mean, it's -- it's largely economically based right now but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, through -- throughout history, it was, uh, of religious proportion so you think that --
L:  But based also -- in the beginning it was based on land transfer --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- before Israel was even built, because remember, based on Israel, it -- it -- the old Testament stuff remember.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Israel was not supposed to have its own land until the sc- the coming of the Messiah.
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  So, technically having the land of Israel was an economic gain after the Holocaust.  And it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- was only because we felt bad.  "Oh, shit, you guys really got it -- well, you guys really got it up the arse.  Sorry, here -- here's a country".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and then all of a sudden, we're like Palestine was okay.  They were financially strong at the time.  They're like, yeah, some parts -- here's some land to take over and then all of a sudden they started doing refugees and then they claimed the land of Israel.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Nobody accepted it until -- when -- until the States accepted it, then Israel actually consider -- be considered a country unto itself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But Zionists, they hate -- I mean the Zionists movement was not towards the -- in basically the orthodox, uh, Judaism.  It was all based on economics and you're right, you're absolutely going in the right direction.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was economics only and -- and property of course.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Each claiming a land in their own.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even after, um -- even after the UN told -- the UN told Israel to pull out of that Gaza strip.  You know what they started doing?
R:  No.
L:  Soliciting p- uh. Uh, Jews -- uh, Jews in every country to go into that area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just like, you know, I'm like -- I'm like, "Wait a second.  Don't use religion".  I mean, I hate it when these -- my -- my -- my Christian friends all of a sudden you know we're like talking love and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then all of a sudden they bring politics into it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know and it's like [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't -- you know, like Jesus never said, "Like this person but only if he's a Christian".
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, because, you know, the other guys, you know just ignore 'em [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It just never happened like that, I'm sorry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and, uh, and good old dubya, he never said, uh, I mean, I can't believe he like God will bless us because we're killing people but we're killing these people in his name.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think God was all about like, "Hey, this is this race and that is that race and this is this religion and this is that religion".
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Are -- are you religious?  Do you practice a -- a religion?
L:  I don't practice religion.  Um, I guess I'm more spiritual than anything.  Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I do -- I was raised -- I was raised a Christian but I really had a problem when people were saying, "and those who don't believe are damned" you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you're different, you're damned.  You're going to hell.  Well, you're going to hell.  I'm like, W- w- w- wait, Jesus said two things.  He said the two major, uh, uh commandments were love God with all your heart, your mind and your soul and love one another as you would -- basically do unto others.  The golden rule.  And I'm like, if he said all commandments are based on that, how can I put heat in something that's so -- as great as something as God.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how can I define something that I can't mentally define?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  There's -- there's a thing in physics that says, "Once you define something, you limit it to its definition".
R:  Yeah.
L:  As something speeds up, you -- the more accurate you are towards its velocity and -- and direction the least accurate you are to its position and vice versa.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Because it's -- it's inversely proportional to each other.
R:  Right.
L:  So, once you define something in any kind of cognitive thinking, you limit it to its definition.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm like --
R:  Are you in --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  What?  Are -- are you in school now?
L:  No, no, no.  I used to be.  I'm -- I was at Ohio University, computer science.
R:  Uh, you said Ohio?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, that's cool.  Yeah, what -- what do you do now?
L:  I'm in Toronto now.
