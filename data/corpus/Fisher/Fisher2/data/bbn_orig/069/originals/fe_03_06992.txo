R:  Nisha.
L:  Hi, my name is Jay.
R:  Hey.  How are you doing?
L:  Hi.  Um, where are you from?
R:  I'm from Arkan saw.
L:  Oh, I'm from ah New Jersey.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, so what do you do?
R:  [NOISE] So, the topic is [LAUGH] what do you think about computers?
L:  Oh, sorry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I d- -- I mean, I definitely think they help education --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  I mean I -- I'm -- I'm still a student and I've been a student --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I've had -- I've been a student with and without the Internet --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the Internet is just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it just changes everything 'cause it just -- I mean, it completely alters how you interact --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE]
L:  -- with everyone else.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there's -- and how you get information and how much information is available --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I agree 'cause I'm a college student and I -- I ah have a computer at home, it's -- it's a lot of things we've studied in, you know, pull up on the Internet, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  C- -- you know, great things and they can be legal things too, so it's good to have a computer if you're going to you know use it for a personal use and good use and then it's a lot of --
L:  Yeah.  And even --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even if it's like outside of school if it's something you're interested in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you just want to read up on it, there's so much information you can find on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a certain topic and you can also --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- talk with other people about it, which I think is even cooler --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because then I mean 'cause so much of what is written about a certain topic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is always biased because you get so many different perspectives with the Internet.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I do my like -- I used to go to college but see I do in home college now, so I do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all my college work over the Internet and stuff like that [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah and something -- well, sometimes when I do ah homework from home, you know, illegal stuff pops up and all that kind of stuff so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Yeah [LIPSMACK] but it's -- the computer is great these days you know, there's just so much out there you can just look up and stuff like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like what's going over in Iraq and all that --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Those good and d- -- yeah.
L:  Because I mean in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like since the Internet -- and it's a lot more convenient, so like I didn't always read the newspaper before but now I can just click a website and I can go read, get current events at just a click, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean it sounds silly that ah somebody could be so lazy if they're that interested in getting information --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it does make a difference, I think.
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  I think it's great, too, you know, different websites and stuff you can go and click on this stuff and I mean it is great, you know, computer is fun, you know, to be on and stuff like that and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just -- there's a lot of you know history you can look up, you know --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- there's science and stuff like that, so [LIPSMACK] yeah, studies --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- and stuff like colleges and stuff, you know, you can look up, you know, like University of Phoenix you can look up there to have like marketing and business, you know, education and all that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Stuff like that.
L:  I think there's some -- there's some like I mean it does hurt education in some ways.  I mean, it makes it easier to plagiarize or like get around to actually reading a book to ah complete an assignment, but I think -- I guess maybe the positives outweigh the negatives in terms of how to face education.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause I know like I was ah going to move to a different state one time, Florida --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I went on there to tried the apartments and stuff and so much stuff came up, you know, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- rent houses and buy houses and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, actually you can go on there and type in address bar, you know, things to rent and a lot of stuff will come up in different cities and states and zip codes too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So I think it's interesting, don't you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You have a computer?
L:  Yeah.  Um I mean, I w- -- I think like I -- I have a computer and most of the kids I know have computers and if not every like everyone I know has access because they can go down to the library or something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Because I have a computer too and like something like home base and all that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I go on there and type in work from home and stuff and just the majority of things just come up, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're just so interesting, you know, medicines and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean everything, stores and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and -- yeah, you can like all this personal stuff like if you have a problem you can find information on it real -- a lot more easily than --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you could before the Internet was present.  Like say if you have a medical problem --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's like web MD or something.
R:  Yeah, you go there and type it in and a lot of stuff comes up, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  And like -- it's not like -- even doing assignments with ah like if you have an assignment with a group --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the Internet a lot easier and it makes the assignment better because [MN] to work together you don't actually have to be meeting physically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is cool.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I like it because um I mean you can just go and type something -- everything in, just everything come up, like all [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, you can just type in [inaudible] rock and just majority of things come up and so I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like [inaudible] it just comes up.
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  It is good to have a computer at home, you know, then you can check the weather on the Internet and all that stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That -- that's awesome.
R:  Yeah, the time and temperature and stuff like that, yeah.
L:  Sometimes it's overwhelming, though, because there's just so much information.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I mean you don't know where to start and where to end.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you don't know what's legitimate sometimes and what's not.
R:  Yeah.  Because I've been on there every night on the computer and I just type in so much stuff --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like this and stuff, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and mail and all kinds of -- a lotta the stuff just starts coming at me, though.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah -- I still use mine for ah you know because I'm a student -- well, I used to go to college and you know I had a computer in my room but now I do it from home and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's -- it's basically -- it's the same, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's interesting.  But was I going to um join University of Phoenix at one time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  And I could do my ah studies and courses over the Internet on my computer.  I was going to take up ah nursing yeah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I'm an LTN and so that's why I got ah a degree from off the computer, University of Phoenix --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you can do that from home or you can go into the -- you know, the -- ah corporate office and take it up too.
L:  I guess that's another way it helps education, not just in terms of the information, but just like way -- it's an easier way of getting education in terms of there are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you can't -- like, it -- it makes -- it offers it to more people, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- I mean --
R:  Yeah.  That's a lot of um --
L:  Upside.
R:  I mean, yeah, you can -- you can pick up a lot of education and stuff, I mean you can just type in there and a lot of stuff come up like digital books for education and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, they have that on the Internet and stuff also, history, science and stuff, you just type it in and a lot of stuff come up.  Like, if you wanted to take a trade or something up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, it just -- out there a lot of marketing and stuff, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ch- -- so most of them you don't have to, you know, go -- leave your house and do -- you can do a lot of them, you know, they'll send your studies in the mail and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they used to do me like that when I used to do the University of Phoenix --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  I just do it from my computer, so it's fine sometimes because sometimes I like a lot of private, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Me, I work good, you know, alone when you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's why I used to do it from home, yeah.
L:  So, what about classes, how does that work if you're ah going to school like that?
R:  Ah, actually ah it's this -- it's a email like if you have any questions or concerns or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- one of the ah coaches, you know, can email you or phone you, you have a toll free number --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they can phone you or send an email through the computer system they will contact you.  It's real easy.  You have like ten coaches, you know, just teaching you.
L:  Does that take more studying, though?
R:  Uh-uh.  It's basically it's the same.  You -- yeah, it's the same.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  And I -- and to me, my, you know, I understand, you know, them over the phone where I can do you know in a classes you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  They just send me a lot of stuff and I study it, you know, and I've been -- yeah, that's how I got my ah diploma too.
L:  Would you say you like that better?
R:  Yeah, I like that better.
L:  That way?
R:  Plus --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- that's how I got my um high school diploma, from home too, over the computer too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, so the computer is neat these days.  You know, they make the computer systems different [inaudible] and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and different stuff on 'em you can get 'em built different, you know --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- with everything on it.  So --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, kids, they look -- kids these days, you know, learning a lot of stuff on the computer, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and a lot of their parents letting 'em do it from home, too.
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  Yeah.  So doing that.
L:  Well, there's a lot more like -- there's a lot -- a lot of like new software programs that help learning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, it's not much to do with the Internet, but it's like -- like there's a lot of games online that are educational --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- which I think are pretty cool.
R:  Yeah, I got the one, the [inaudible] ah [several inaudible words] like that you can ah [NOISE] type it in and download it for free for like little kids --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and stuff.

R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they have like three D interactive pictures of the stuff you're learning --
R:  Really.
