R:  Kevin George.
L:  Hi, I'm Elisa.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Um, so did you hear the question?
R:  Yes, I believe it's, do computers in school -- or just education, [inaudible] --
L:  I --
R:  -- harm or improve?
L:  Yeah, I think it's just in general.  I dunno.
R:  Okay, well what do you think about that?
L:  Um, I don't -- I think it probably helps it.  Um, I mean, I -- the internet's been, like, a totally -- it's, like, just found[?] so much stuff.  I guess it -- it makes research easier which, I guess, then maybe could harm, and I guess, because you don't have to go to the library and look for stuff.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think that you could actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- learn more because then you -- it's easier to find so you don't get discouraged. 
R:  Right.
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  I think, overall, it is helpful.  It could be harmful in some ways to the point where the kid may not know how to -- how to use it.  I mean, really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because to me, Yahoo dot com, that's -- that to me is -- is a very good research 'cause it's, you know, it's a big search engine.
L:  Yeah, totally.
R:  So, I mean, if the kid knows how to use it, then it -- it obviously it will help improve, so I think in -- in schools, they need to have classes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- possibly, to teach the -- teach the kids how to use it or what are the, you know, the helpful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sites and helpful links and everything like that.
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  Yeah, but, I mean, it -- it works a lot because so- some kids can't drive or -- or can't get rides to -- to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the library.
L:  And libraries are rarely open any more, either.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  So --
R:  And, you know, and they have to get a library card and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, the -- the computers are just a lot -- a lot easier --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I think it helps more than anything.
L:  Yeah, I -- I do too.  I -- I remember, when I was in school, we had a computer class and they were really, just like the basic computers but I learnt to make programs and stuff and it was as totally fun.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and, I mean, it doesn't help me any more now, 'cause --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- like, computers are so much more advanced but --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- for a while there, I was really on top of it. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  [inaudible] 
L:  It was really good.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, but that's what I think.  I just think that, ah, if the kids keep, I mean, if it -- if they use computers or whatever, I mean, see, but it could be distracting though.  Because a kid could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, download a music and sit there and not concentrate or talk to his friends on the internet and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that, I think that's the only way it could be, you know, it -- it -- it could be, you know, harmful but if the school, you know, puts a lock on, you know, AOL and puts a lock on music programs, you know, then it could be all right.
L:  Yeah, totally.
R:  But -- but, um, other than that though, I mean, or they -- they could, you know, email and stuff like that.  That -- that can be very distracting but, I mean, I don't know, I mean --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I don't -- I don't know how they use computers in the classroom these days.  Besides the internet?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm wondering if they use, like, other programs, maybe to teach them math or something 'cause --
R:  Well, yeah, that -- that would also be a big help.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think -- I think most of the time it's just the internet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Ah --
L:  'Cause I know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, granted that internet wasn't around, but we had this, like, numbers game and it was, like, you had to munch the numbers that were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- divis- -- like, divisible by three or something and --
R:  Mhm.  Right.
L:  -- I mean, so that -- those are little games and it's a game, it's fun for kids and it's, like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- especially in the age where we have, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- com- -- video games, it's like, "Oh, it's a video game but I'm learning". [inaudible] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  Exact- -- I know exactly what you said[?].
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think, I mean, um, actually, I'm only eighteen now but when I was younger, they -- they still had those around.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm only twenty two, so ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  And those were really fun and I remember, like, playing Oregon Trial two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was really funny.  You used to have to learn like, what -- what to buy and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what to do and stuff.
R:  Yeah, I think -- I also think if they have certain kinds of games on the computers, then that could, ah, help encourage and they could -- they -- they would want to use the computers to learn.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And things like that.
L:  'Cause it's like a fun thing, yeah.
R:  Exactly.  Do you think that in, like, a hundred years from now, they'll no such things as teachers?  And it will all just be computers?
L:  Ooh.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's weird.
R:  [LAUGH] That would be weird.
L:  I -- I would hope not because that would -- I think that would be bad.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Um, 'cause teachers like to give you motivation and it's a real person [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- rather than a machine.  But I -- that could totally happen, I can see that totally happening.
R:  Yeah.  They're gonna have [inaudible] chips and all of those and we're gonna be all --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- electronic and stuff.  It's gonna happen.  You watch and see.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  It's kinda scary.
R:  Yeah, right.  It is scary but, oh, well.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well, we'll be dead by then, I guess.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, we're gonna die, who cares?  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We'll let our kids worry about it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Ah, Seattle.  And you?
R:  Seattle?  I'm in Michigan.
L:  Oh, wow.  Nice.
R:  Yeah.  I've never been to Seattle before.
L:  It's pretty nice right now.  It's, like, sixty degrees.
R:  Right?  Sixty degrees?  All right.
L:  In the sixties, yeah.
R:  Usually, um, in Michigan it's, like, a million below zero.
L:  Ooh.  
R:  No matter what time of the day or what day of the week it is.  But Michigan weather, ask anyone from Michigan, they'll tell you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's just horrible.
L:  Oh.
R:  The weather's always [inaudible] over here.  Did you, ah, did you go to public school or private school?
L:  Public.
R:  Public.  So, I went to private school.
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How do -- how was that different?  Do -- did you find --
R:  Well --
L:  -- that, like, did you ever go to public school at all then?
R:  I did.  I actually went to public school from, what, I dunno, preschool to eight -- no, no -- preschool to eighth grade --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the only -- only in the seventh grade I went to a private school.  And I went back --
L:  Did you --
R:  -- from school.
L:  Did you find that you were ahead of your classes?  Like -- like in eighth grade, were you ahead, like[?] you were, like, "Oh, I did this in seventh grade"?
R:  Yeah.  I did.  And in eighth grade I was a [inaudible] I already learned all this stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, I went to -- but then in the ninth grade I went to a private school again.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And then, in tenth grade for half the year, I went back to public school --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and then for the rest of the tenth grade, I went back to private school and I -- and I was there for the rest of high school.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so when people say, "Oh, private school's this and public school's that", I'm pretty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can pretty much answer the question.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I've been to both and I can say, "No, I know what ya -- trust me, I know what it is".  But, um, from what I took in, the friends wise, the friends in public schools and stuff, I mean, it's -- I think it's better I -- I should say.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In private --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- school, it's stuck up and, you know, people are just -- they have their cliques but I guess they have their cliques in -- in public school as well.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think overall private school was better.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I remember I had a friend from school who went to -- she was just so much smarter, she just knew all -- so much more stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because she'd gone to -- to public school, er, private school before.
R:  Mhm.
L:  In- interesting.
R:  Yeah, it's interesting.  I mean, public, I mean, [NOISE] I mean, some people can't really go to private school and it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- money wise and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, I'm gonna send my kids to private school for high sch- -- for, ah, high school, but for elementary school and middle school, I think I'm going to just send them to public school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, they -- I -- there were some kids there who -- who have never been to public school, they've been at private schools all their life.  And they're just, kinda --
L:  Ooh.
R:  -- not, ah, what's the word I'm looking for?  They're not with it, we'll say.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They're -- they're just kinda, I dunno.  I mean, I've no -- you see, in public school you -- you -- you -- you can learn attitude, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you can get a good personality because you're di- -- you're with boys and you're with girls and you're -- you see, I went to an all guys school.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  That's even more intense.
R:  What's that?
L:  That's even more intense.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's more intense.  So, so -- but -- but in public schools there's -- there's guys --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's girls, there's, you know, all that drama you gotta deal with --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and stuff like that.  And you just -- I dunno, you develop a good personality.  And then --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  -- then when it comes to high school, that's when you're matured and you can deal with not having girls around.  But I will definitely send my kids to public school for, at least 'til eighth grade and then I'll throw 'em private school.
L:  Oh, nice. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, [NOISE] do you -- did you wear uniforms in private school?
R:  Well, it was actually -- okay, in seventh grade we did.  It was blue or navy blue pants and, I dunno, different colored --
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] 
R:  -- everything else but, um, in our school, we -- we had to wear -- we have to wear khakis and we have to have a but- -- ah, a collared shirt and we have to wear a belt.  And that -- and that's it.  And we can't wear the color orange because that's our rival school. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...
L:  Do you -- do you like it better or ...?
R:  You know, it's -- I was actually one of the biggest leaders there.  I was, you know, I was -- I was the big cheerleader guy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was, you know -- and, um, I loved my school.  I -- I really did.  It -- it all depends what school you go to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I went to Detroit Catholic Central and that was an amazing school.  They -- [SIGH] I -- I can't explain it, it's all up to the school really.  But I loved it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I really loved the private school.
L:  Wow.  What -- what do you think about uniforms?  Do you think that those --
R:  You know, you know what?  I think uniforms, if -- if -- it -- it's -- it's a way to -- it's a way to have, um, what's the word?  It's a way to have, um, order --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I should say.  I mean, I -- I -- I don't -- I don't -- uniforms I agree with.  That's fine.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't have a problem with uniforms.  I think it's a good idea to, basically, I mean, yell at students -- if they're not wearing it, you yell at 'em, you get 'em in trouble, it's -- it's the way --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of showing, "Hey, I'm the boss".  Right?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, that's -- yeah, that's pretty much what it -- what it was.  But uniforms was cool. I never -- I never minded too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They didn't make us wear ties and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, if you were late to school or something, they'd make you wear a tie for the rest of the week or something like that, but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it -- it got -- I mean, the discipline there was great.  So, I'm -- I'm -- I'm into discipline, not -- not -- not hitting people but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, teaching them.  I mean, with discipline and saying, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that -- that's what I'm about, so ...
L:  Interesting.  Yeah, I've always -- not -- wonder where I stood on uniforms because I could see they could be good and they could be bad.
R:  Mhm.  But I think -- I think with uniforms, though, it's a good way of keeping them straight and keeping them in order.  You know?
L:  Mm.  Okay.
R:  And -- and, um, I dunno, I'm -- I'm glad they -- they use uniforms, like, you see, in public school you can wear whatever you want.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's -- and that's your way of freedom and the school can't do anything about it.  But in private school they can do whatever they want about it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They'll say, "Go home.  Don't come back until you're in your -- in your uniform".
L:  Mhm.
R:  See -- see that's how it's different.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's -- and, when you're in private school and you have people telling you that, that's like, I mean, that's like, "Okay, I'm going to go to school tomorrow.  I'm going to be in uniform so they don't yell at me and I'm going to sit in class and be quiet and learn".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Public school, "I'm gonna come in wearing a weird hat and weird ripped up jeans.  And I'm going to look all cool and nobody's gonna say anything and I don't have to go to class and I don't --"
