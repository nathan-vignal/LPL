L:  Hello.
R:  Hi [MN]
L:  Hello.  My name is, uh, Kyle.
R:  Hi, Kyle.  My name's Gretchen.
L:  I'm calling from Seattle, Washington.
R:  Oh, I've always wanted to go to Seattle.  Oh, I'm --
L:  Really?
R:  -- I'm in the Tampa Bay area in Florida.
L:  Oh.  Where's your southern accent?
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was going to say, "Hang on, I don't have a southern accent".  I'm -- I'm actually from Wisconsin originally.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I've been living down here for almost eighteen years.
R:  Oh, right.
L:  Oh, I wish we could talk about Seattle [LAUGH].
R:  I know, darn it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well I don't know.  I wasn't prepared to -- to be this intellectual about peace in the Middle East. [LAUGH].
L:  I know.  I -- I didn't know what the topic was going to be until literally this second and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to be completely honest, I don't keep up with what's going on in the world as much as I'm supposed to, um, so I -- honestly I don't even know [LAUGH] if I should be participating in this conversation today but what the heck, I'll give it a try.  Um --
R:  Well, I think it's supposed to be like the average person's, uh, just, you know, whatever we think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't -- I don't -- I think, um, [NOISE]--
L:  We're supposed to say whether or not we think that there is ever going to be world peace and I hate to sound like a pessimist but I'm rather realistic and let me just say, um, no, [MN] I do not think so.
R:  I tend to agree with you.  Just --
L:  It's sad, as it is.
R:  -- because human nature being what we are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we're so aggressive and so --
L:  And everybody's so --
R:  -- selfish.
L:  -- greedy.  Exactly.
R:  They're so greedy.
L:  Yes, yes.  Everybody just wants more and, you know, it's always gonna be the grass on the other side is always greener and even if we get to the other side, and the grass isn't greener, then we'll go --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- right back to where we started with to see if [LAUGH], you know, if the grass is greener there and everybody's just gonna want --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- more and more and nobody's ever gonna get enough.  Everybody is hungry for all this world power and give me all the money I can possibly get.  I don't want anybody to have any of it and -- and it's just completely unfair and --
R:  [MN] I totally agree with you.
L:  Thanks.
R:  Totally, um, because I think we live in a society where we're judged on how much we have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and not only how many toys we have but how expensive our toys are.
L:  Yes.
R:  And I think that's at every level.
L:  And gotta show them off, show off how great our toys are --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to everybody else --
R:  And, um --
L:  Brag about them.
R:  Because, like, I think even our -- our President has -- has -- always has to have a -- a -- a macho presence and a tough guy presence, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think, um, a lot of my friends agree with him and do not agree with us, you know, and have to have bigger and not only bigger bombs but the biggest bombs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think we're living -- I mean everybody is so technologically advanced that we could blow ourselves up, you know, without even --
L:  Right.
R:  -- trying that hard.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean it's not like the civil war days or whatever.  I mean, [MN] it's kinda frightening when you think about it how --
L:  Oh, it's terrifying.
R:  Yeah.  How, um, like North Korea and, um, [MN] [NOISE] you know, Russia and North Korea and all these countries [COUGH] and instead of trying to live in peace, we're -- we're trying to prove our or achieve our dom- world dominance --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- although this is kind of a corny expression, it is becoming a global village, you know.
L:  No, yeah.  You're right, you're right.
R:  You know, I think, and everybody has -- I -- I don't think it'll be accomplished, you know, certainly not peace in my lifetime.
L:  No, I don't think it'll be peace in -- in my lifetime either.  I -- I agree with you there.
R:  Which is totally -- is real- really sad because I think we're always gonna have these kinds of things and war and -- and this kind of unrest.
L:  I mean, honestly I, you know -- I don't know whether this is going to sound bad or not but I have been told that I would be perfect communist because I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I just believe that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, nobody should have it all, nobody should be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- totally rich, nobody should have the excuse to be poor.  Um, everybody --
R:  I know.
L:  -- we should all have the basics of life, toilet paper, toothpaste, drinking water, you name it, provided for us even if it is by the --
R:  I know.
L:  -- government.  Whatever has to be done just in order for everybody to maintain living and not be completely miserable and I mean, I -- I understand points of view of -- of people that say, "Well, no if -- you know, if you work hard then you should have more than people who are lazy and don't work hard".  I see that point of view too --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but it's that kind -- you know, it's -- all that is is greed and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- greed is why the communism thing doesn't work out --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- because every -- like you were saying about everybody wanting the bigger toys, everybody wanting --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- to win, --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- that's why -- I think that's why world peace isn't going to happen, at least not in this -- in -- not in our life span --
R:  Sadly.
L:  -- because everybody just wants too much.  
R:  Yes.
L:  It's take -- it's just like you said, like it's human nature and we're just greedy and we're selfish.  We want it all for ourselves no matter how well we -- no matter how much we try to think for other people and try to be considerate, no matter whoever is the nicest person in the world, still wants --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- as much for himself, you know.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  You know, what's in it for me?  Even every good deed we do is --
R:  I know.
L:  -- something to do for ourselves because you know why?  It makes us feel good about ourselves.
R:  You know, I'm the only one of my friends who has stated that and I agree with you so much.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  There is no such thing as a selfless good deed because --
R:  Because I have so many friends I say [COUGH] you know, token kindness is just making you feel good about yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You haven't changed the other person's plight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like a -- a guy -- I know this -- we're getting off the subject but [NOISE] you know, like what you were saying, we should have basic needs.  I mean, in Seattle, you know, I live near Bellevue.  You know, Bill Gates the richest man in the world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- I see food lines after work.  You know, people standing in line for a peanut butter sandwich, for God's sake.
L:  That is just so sad.
R:  It is, and here I live in the -- you know, [MN] next to basically the richest man in the world --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I mean --
L:  There's just -- there's no excuse for that.
R:  There -- there isn't.
L:  You know -- you know what my Mum says about like -- I know getting off topic again but about money, about the whole state lottery stuff.
R:  Yes.
L:  You see that it goes up to, like, seventeen million dollars and stuff --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and one person is supposed to get that. 
R:  I know.
L:  That is B.S.  I'm sorry.
R:  I know.
L:  I agree with my mother.  Seventeen people should get one million dollars.
R:  It's like God Almighty.
L:  That's the way it should be.  Much better chances of winning and who is gonna do anything with actually seventeen million dollars in a lifetime.
R:  I know.
L:  You can do so much with a million.  Invest it properly --
R:  I know, I know, I know.
L: -- et cetera.  You know, it just -- it's -- greed is unbelievable.  It makes me feel really bad to actually be a human being.
R:  Yeah, sometimes.
L:  It just -- I --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I feel guilty being human.  I pray to God and I apologize for being a sinning human being because --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I know that I'm associated with all this cruelty and sadness and misery in the world.
R:  Yes, you and me both.
L:  And speaking of misery in the world, I just saw on the news the other day, I don't know if you heard about this, but that -- that Iraqi man that was so afraid and so adamantly opposed to living under the regime of Saddam Hussein that he lived in a little tunnel in a cave --
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  -- that he made in his basement --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- for twenty -- like, twenty one years.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh my God.  I -- I got -- I've got goosebumps thinking about it right now how sad that was for that man.
R:  [MN] Yes.  I know.
L:  It was so heartbreaking and seeing him coming up out of that hole and he was so frail and so fragile.  Probably just terrified, had no idea what was going on in the world and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- could you just -- I mean, when you really think about it, imagine what it would be like even to be in there for a day, no less twenty one years.
R:  Twenty one years for God's sake and like --
L:  All that to avoid living under the regime of somebody that he was so opposed to.
R:  And then --
L:  I say, "good for him".
R:  So do I and then like when I drive past -- I mean, Seattle has a stadium just for football and right next door a stadium just for baseball, you know.
L:  Hm.
R:  And then there was a great uproar, uh, they couldn't get enough, um, voters -- consensus to have, like, um,  outdoor porta potties for the homeless for God's sake.
L:  Oh my God.
R:  You know, and so you're totally right.  I mean, it -- it -- we are so selfish at the most basic human being levels --
L:  I know.
R:  -- that, of course, there's gonna be world poverty and war and because we're all so darn selfish and aggressive.
L:  Yep.  That -- all that greediness is where the war all stems from.  Everybody's gotta have it all.
R:  You know, and I've never heard until talking to you -- everybody disagrees with me that we help someone to feel good about ourselves.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know and that's not -- that's not necessarily wrong but giving someone a dollar and feeling good that we've changed someone, we haven't done anything.
L:  No, not -- not a whole lot, no.
R:  No, and um, I've never heard someone agree with me until I'm talking to you tonight [LAUGH].
L:  I mean, if ten thousand people in a row gave that poor person a dollar --
R:  Exactly --
L:  -- each, that'd --
R:  -- exactly.
L:  -- be a wonderful thing [LAUGH] but --
R:  And --
L:  -- just a buck from one person, all that does is make us feel a little happy and --
R:  I --
L:  -- wonderful and so --
R:  -- I know.
L:  -- we can go to the movies and treat ourselves and go to the mall on a five hundred dollar spending spree --
R:  I know.
L:  -- all because, "Oh, I'm gonna treat myself because I gave the guy enough to buy a cheeseburger at McDonalds" [MN] you know.
R:  Yeah, tonight.
L:  Yeah, yeah, one night.
R:  And, um, but no it's like I expect any day now, North Korea, or whatever, we're gonna be in war...
