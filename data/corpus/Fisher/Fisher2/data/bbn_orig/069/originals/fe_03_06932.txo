L:  Hi, my name is Linda.
R:  I'm Diane.
L:  Hi, Diane.
R:  I live in Macon, Georgia.
L:  Okay.  I live in Ellersay[?], Georgia.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  You're close by.  I happen to be a teacher, so um [LIPSMACK] I have pretty strong feelings about computers in education.
L:  Okay.
R:  I feel that um there's nothing that can replace a teacher and that um, you know, computers are important and it really adds a new dimension, but you still need that human in the classroom.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I agree with you there.  Ah 'cause there's some things ah computers can't teach like a real person can.
R:  I have, um, in my classroom, four computers for the children and one for me and um [LIPSMACK] the children are on them all the time and there -- there really is a lot of benefit and we also go to the computer lab once a week, but um there's a lot that you cannot learn from the computer.
L:  Exactly.  It's quite a bit that you can't learn, there's -- I feel that the teachers theirselves can contribute more to the children than a computer can.  Now, that I -- I'm -- I know they can learn things on the computer, it's just that they need that human touch to really learn it and to be there for them.  Because I know there'll be questions and stuff that teachers can answer and computers can't.
R:  Right.  Well, I think the computer is really great to drill and reinforce and um things like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but um, you know, we've kind of gotten a little bit out of hand with um computers and with you being in Georgia, I mean the lottery has funded a lot of computers and we really do have the computers, but unfortunately they haven't done anything to maintain the technology, you know, it's put in there and if it um [LIPSMACK] breaks down, they really haven't funded anything, you know, to maintain the computers, they're just there.
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's right.  They -- they haven't really done anything to maintain them.  All the schools have to -- if something does [inaudible] over it, I guess the schools have to take care of it, don't they?
R:  Well, they're supposed to, I -- but, you know, there's no funding for it, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I just see 'em, you know, like pushed by the wayside and a lot of the computers, you know, just are gathering dust, um, we have one person to maintain the computers that is in our building three days a week and she has to work with fifty teachers and so she has to work with over two hundred computers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um [LIPSMACK] you know, it took all year to get one computer fixed in my classroom, so it --
L:  My goodness, that's a long time.
R:  -- it's ah not as good as it seems.
L:  No, it -- it doesn't because ah -- and that lotteries stuff, to me it doesn't seem like it's helped in Georgia.  I know it's helped some, but I don't think it's helped the way it really should.  I think it could help a lot more.
R:  Well, I mean, I know it's funded the preschool [LAUGH].
L:  Yes.
R:  They probably want us to stick to our topic of ah computers.
L:  You know, and [PAUSE] --
R:  Um, I know that computers really, you know, they spark instruction.  I even have in my classroom -- I'm in a brand new school, the school's only one year old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you know. we have, as far as technology goes, we have the very latest in technology and I have um a TV that um is suspended from the ceiling and then my computer feeds into the TV so I can use the computer to present to the class.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um, I like that aspect because I am controlling it.
L:  Well, that's good.  That's a good point there.
R:  So, I um, I mean, you know, I -- there's um really neat thing called united streaming and it is really a bunch of videos that come through your computer, so whatever we're studying, I can um go onto united streaming and find the topic and it -- it's a short little educational video, it could be from two minutes long to fifteen minutes long.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, that part's really good, but um, you know, as far as --
L:  Well, I didn't know that part.  That -- that does sound good, though, the -- I didn't know about that part that ah -- I know in my -- my grandkids' school, like they -- you say, they got computers in there too and the kids, they just love the computers, it seems like they love computers sometimes more than they do like to be with the teachers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, that's what I don't -- I don't want my kids to prefer computers over teachers.  And that's what I tried to teach them, that I think that computers are good to learn things, but you still need the teachers to be there too.
R:  Right.
L:  And um there is a lot of things that c- teachers can do to help kids with the computers, but I just like the personal effect from teachers better than I do the -- the learning -- learning a lot better from the teachers.
R:  Well, I certainly agree and um, you know, I've been in education a long time -- this is my thirtieth year -- so, I definitely started out when there were no computers in the classroom.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Ah, things have, you know, definitely changed, but we are required in my school system -- and I don't know if it's all over Georgia, if the state law or not -- they have to be on the computer a minimum of twenty minutes a week.  So, you know, we have to document that they are on the computer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at least twenty minutes, which really isn't a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  That's twenty minutes for each kid?
R:  Mhm.  Twenty minutes and, you know, I have twenty two children in my class, so that's um, you know, you have to rotate 'em or else, you know, go to the computer lab, we go to the computer lab once a week for forty five minutes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, you know, we can get all of our time then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, it's pretty much it.  I mean, that's how they get their time in and they want us to teach them all these things other than just use the programs that are on the computer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they want 'em to um know how to do PowerPoint and um -- and I only teach third grade, so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, it's um -- it's pretty sophisticated, what they're expecting them to know how to do. [PAUSE]
L:  I know my kids ah -- I don't think it's required here in [several inaudible words] County that they have to be on the computer a certain amount of time, but I do know that they do ah -- I think more or less the kids around here, it's something they earn, I think, 'cause if they do something special or if um -- it's kind of a reward.
R:  Mhm.  Now, we do something which I -- you might be referring to.  The AR -- accelerated reader -- on the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they earn points.
L:  Yeah, that's what it is.
R:  Yeah.  That um is a big thing and I cannot say that I've seen that it really benefits um most of the children read books that are too easy for them and, you know, just to get the points and um earn just enough to go to the party and [LAUGH] that's it.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but it was my first year using that program.  We did not have it at my other school, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, next year I might see it in a different light, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we definitely did that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um the teachers in Georgia are required to have fifty hours in technology before your certificate can be renewed.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, you know, they're definitely pushing us to use computers.
L:  Yeah, it sounds like they are, that they're really -- they're really wanting the computers to -- it sounds like they're trying to replace a lot of things that the teachers should be doing, um, but I just don't agree with that.  I don't think teachers should be replaced.  I think the te- computers should be there just to help.
R:  Right.  Well, I, um, you know, being one of the oldest teachers in the building, I have to really stick to my um ground about, you know, how I feel about computers, but ah --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, because the children in my class, they test really well and um, you know, but they -- they need me more so than the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And maybe as they're older, you know, I'm sure the teacher of older children might have different views on it than I do, but ah ... you know, they certainly can't replace me, or it'll be a sad day when -- in education when computers do replace the teacher.
L:  Exactly. [PAUSE] Exactly.  I agree with that.  I don't -- I don't even see how they'd be able to replace teachers.  Because it would -- it would be such a tremendous change for the kids that --
R:  Well, one of the things that um is a state wide -- I was told
