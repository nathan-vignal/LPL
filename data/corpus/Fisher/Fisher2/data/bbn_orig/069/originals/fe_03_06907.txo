R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Alyssa[?].
R:  Hi, Alyssa.  I'm Janice.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you [LAUGH].
R:  I'm from Rochester.
L:  Oh, I -- oh, I'm Seattle [LAUGH].
R:  Oh.  Now, I -- I'm sorry, but I couldn't hear what -- what the computer was saying --
L:  Oh, that's all right.
R:  -- what is the topic?
L:  It happened yesterday to me, too.  Um, it's, "Do you consider any other countries a threat to US security?  If so, why?"
R:  Oh, do -- do I consider another -- other countries a threat to us?
L:  Yes or- --
R:  Here in America, probably.
L:  To our security.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Well, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do.  You know, after this nine eleven thing that happened, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I certainly do feel threatened all the time.  
L:  Okay.
R:  How do you feel?
L:  I -- I f- -- I -- I definitely got scared after it, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I feel -- I don't really -- I feel that something could happen um but I -- I don't think that it's unwarranted and I think that the -- the terror we put into so many other countries and so many other people that it's no wonder --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this stuff happens to us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um --
R:  But I mean like after it happened, um, did it leave you feeling like for instance in my case --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I am petrified to fly and I know that it's so silly, but it's just how I feel, you know --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm really frightened.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think it's silly --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, 'cause my mom won't fly now, um, I -- I -- I get a little more nervous now when I do fly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um --
R:  Have you flown since?
L:  Yes, I've flown a lot, actually.  Um --
R:  You see, my children do too, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I mean everyone in my family has flown except for me [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  And --
R:  [MN] I've always had a fear to begin with --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but now I'm really afraid.
L:  Yeah, that makes sense.  I mean --
R:  And -- and I don't want to feel that way so I think the only way for me to overcome it is by doing it.
L:  Yeah, oh, I agree.
R:  You know and -- ah -- because I certainly don't want to give in to it, but um [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it becomes harder and harder because everytime you pick up the paper and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you think now the code um for terrorism is orange you know and -- and you think, "What's going t happen next?" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  And -- and that frightens me.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I think that a lot of it is convenient I -- I mean I -- I'm not trying to discount your fear in any way --
R:  No, but I need that --
L:  -- I th- --
R:  -- you know, I need --
L:  -- yeah, I -- I think that the media and the government wants you to be scared so that -- so that when we go to war, it's "Okay, well we're trying to stop this fear" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um e- -- bowling for Columbine was a r- -- like that -- the Michael Moore movie --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I highly suggest watching it, it's really good.
R:  Mm.
L:  But it's all about how like he -- people are scared and that scare brings out violence and you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, I'm scared of the Iraqis attacking us, so let's go attack them first.
R:  I know.  [MN]
L:  And I -- I think that -- that no wonder people attack us because we're doing so many horrible things --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- um now, I am scared, like I'm -- I'm scared of things happening all the time, but I just I tr- --
R:  I know.  Well, I mean you know it wouldn't stop me from going to um an event or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or you know if you wanted to go to ah let's say a sporting event or anywhere, you know, but I -- I'm always wondering and thinking and sometimes even you know I'm out in the public a lot and sometimes you look at people and you -- you're starting to look at them a little differently --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and I'm not a prejudiced person, so [SIGH] you know it's really hard for me um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to look at them that way, but sometimes I really do get a little nervous [LAUGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think that's what happened to me.  Um, so yeah, sometimes I -- I do ah have this fear in me.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think that -- yeah, that's --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- gonna happen.
R:  But I'm smart enough to know that I shouldn't let it -- I shouldn't let it overtake my life.
L:  That's good, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  That's really good.
R:  You know.  And -- and I certainly don't instill it on my family, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my children and things.  I -- I'm worried that they're going to fly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then again I was always worried [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I always think, "Oh, is their plane going to fall out of the air?" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  Flying's scary, it's totally --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we're not made to be up there [LAUGH] like --
R:  Well, you know, you -- sometimes you wonder.  I mean, as soon as I get in an airplane, the first thing I do is I buckle up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't even think about using the bathroom or anything [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] It's -- yeah, it's a frightening experience.
R:  [MN] Just get to my destination [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  It's such -- 'cause it's like so nicer to fly, but --
R:  [MN] Mhm, oh yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- 
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- it is scarier and --
R:  I know um --
L:  -- because of course I hear people say like --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- statistics wise it's like --
R:  Safer?
L:  -- it's -- it's you will have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than being in a plane accident.
R:  Really?
L:  Which seems crazy, because I've never known anyone either, so --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I mean.
R:  Well, I know that um I used to fly every year.  I used to go out to visit my brother in California every year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everytime he would meet me at the airport I would be as white as a ghost --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- when I got off the plane.
L:  -- geeze.
R:  I was a nervous [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Either I would have to have a drink or I'd have to take some kind of a tranquilizer.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, man [LAUGH].
R:  Oh God, it was terrible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But um, you know, it started to get a little better, but then after this happened --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm oh boy, you won't find me up there for a long time.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, it makes sense.  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But and I do want to do it, so badly, you know, because I'm just missing out on so much, um, I'm hurting myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's not good.
L:  Well, there's other ways to travel, too, it just takes longer.
R:  Well, I'm afraid of all forms [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, like --
R:  I mean I -- I keep thinking that, you know, if you take a train --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then something could happen on the train and the only form of travel that I'm not afraid of is by car -- isn't that strange?
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And it's probably is the worst way.
L:  It's the -- the most dangerous, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know [LAUGH].  But the --
L:  I guess because you feel like you have more control?
R:  Mhm.  I think that's it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  I think that's what it probably is.  And ah -- [LAUGH].  Oh, it's so silly, isn't it?  Oh gosh.  Our fears, but [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  But, anyway, it -- it you know, it's -- it's interesting.  It's interesting.  So, you live in Seattle?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's a nice place.
L:  Yeah, it's really nice right now [LAUGH].
R:  Nice and warm?
L:  It's warm and it hasn't really rained, it's just -- but it's cool enough.  I was just in Arizona and it was so hot, I'm dying.
R:  Mm.  Oh is it, that's where my best friends are moving too, Arizona.
L:  Yeah.  It was like a hundred and eight.
R:  Oh, how lovely [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, today in Rochester we woke up to such cold -- it's so cold that I swear it was snowing out --
L:  Oh gee [MN].
R:  -- it was so cold today, June first, um it was raining and we had to have the heat on in the house and your breath -- you could see your breath.
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  That's how cold it was.  I think it was only thirty.
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We haven't had any summer yet, or any -- any spring.  It's been like this --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- oh, forever.  It's been like this the whole month of May.
L:  Oh, that's horrible. [LAUGH] 
R:  Freezing [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- I don't think we've had --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- hardly any nice days yet.
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  So, um, I'm looking forward to something warm [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I bet [LAUGH].
R:  You know, but I mean like we have to go get your winter -- winter robe out again and your --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- everything, you know, I saw people today, I had to go out and work and I saw people today walking around with their winter coats on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that really -- that really blew my mind [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] At least I kept my spring coat on, but I wore two sweaters underneath it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I won't put my winter coat back on [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I'm sure you hate it by now [LAUGH].
R:  I am telling you, it's unbelievable.  You know, it really is.
L:  Wow.
R:  I don't know when it's going to warm up.
L:  Gee.
R:  And -- and we've had nothing but rain.  It's all it's been doing is raining, nonstop.
L:  Oh.
R:  My backyard looks like it has a lake in it [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my god.
R:  Oh, well.  Whatever.  Whatever.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But ah is this your first -- is it your second time, then, you've been doing this, or ...?
L:  Ah, my second phone call?  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  Oh, the second phone call?
L:  Yeah.
R:  For me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For me too.  So, it's -- it's pretty interesting, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  I mean I -- I don't understand it, but you know, what is it they're conducting a study on um speech patterns, is that it?
L:  I -- I can't really tell [LAUGH].
R:  [MN] I think that's what I read.
L:  Is it?
R:  I read about it in the paper.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I looked into it and then um I decided not to do anything about it, but then someone told me about it.  So, I said, "I'll try it", you know.
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  And -- and I asked and they said that they were conducting a study on speech patterns across the United States --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so I -- I d- -- I don't know how they're getting anything out of this by you and I talking because um unless they're monitoring the call.
L:  Because you what?
R:  Unless they're monitoring those --
L:  Oh yeah, they're recording the phone call.
R:  Oh, they are?
L:  Yeah.  But I --
R:  Oh, I didn't know that.
L:  -- but I guess they look at our patterns, maybe from like different parts of the country, maybe or --
R:  Mhm.  I don't know.  I don't know.  [inaudible] get people talking in across the United States.
L:  Yeah, it's kinda strange [LAUGH].
R:  So, that -- that is really nice.  And you and I certainly are across the United States --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- from one another [LAUGH].
L:  Well, yesterday I -- I didn't know where he was from -- I talked to a man --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I didn't know where he was from, so it was totally weird to think, "Well, this is someone I just talked to, I don't know where he's from and I can't remember his name" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's just kind of weird.
R:  Oh, it's -- I got a man too the first time.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And our subject was on sports --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- can you stand it?  I mean, me of all people [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I --
L:  That wouldn't --
R:  -- really am not into sports at all, but thank god he wasn't either.  So, it was really nice [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, I wouldn't know what to say [LAUGH].
R:  Well, we had a -- we really -- the time went by so fast --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I couldn't believe it when it -- they said it was time to hang up and -- and he said to me, oh I'm so glad, you know, that the two of us don't like sports --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and we just want to [LAUGH] he was from Salem, Massachusetts, so that was --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- really nice [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH] So --
L:  That's interesting.  He was c- -- he was pretty close to you, then.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.  He wasn't too far.
L:  -- not that far.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So we --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and he did have an accent, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I thought to myself, oh my goodness, you know, so maybe that's what they're doing.  I -- I really don't know.  But -- but um, whatever.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It was interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was interesting.  Now, we're only allowed to make three calls.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that correct?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  That's what I thought.  But, getting back to the subject at hand, ah I don't know
