L:  Hello, I'm -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  -- Jennifer.
R:  Hi Jennifer.  This is Sarah.
L:  So, what do you think about computer in the -- in the education?
R:  Oh, absolutely.  I -- I definitely think it's a plus.  It definitely helps, at least from what I see from my children.  It's just so much easier these days than, I guess, when I had to do reports and everything.  Everything -- 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- is, like, you have your own library right here at home.  So, they get to use everything that they want and can research, of course, you know, with my supervision but I definitely say that it helps.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How about -- 
L:  The -- 
R:  -- yourself?
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's good.  They also even -- nowadays they even have -- it -- it -- a pilot program where they have a school which is totally on line.  It's called the, um, in my state -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- which probably, um, which is called a virtual school.
R:  Wow, so the whole school's running through a, what, virtual com- computers?
L:  It's -- it's -- it's done -- it's done over the computer and you know, I guess, you know, they have -- they let you download some games.  I guess [several inaudible words] probably getting some work to do on your own but, yeah, all they test work it -- you know, all the tests -- 
R:  But, everything is done at home you mean, um, and they get -- 
L:  It's like -- it's -- it's -- the -- they call it the Pennsylvania -- I think it's called -- they call it the Pennsylvania Virtual -- it's like a -- it's like a school that, you know, of course, you know, it's not actually part of a school district but -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's for people around the state -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to sign up for if you want to.  I got this thing in the mail about it.
R:  Wow.  And this is not something that's just for, like, college kids?  I mean, this is even -- 
L:  No, this is --
R:  -- younger?
L:  -- regular -- d- -- right now they're doing -- they start in ka- -- kindergarten -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they go up to -- right now I think they go up to ninth but they said -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they should get, you know, ninth and you know, tenth through twelve soon.
R:  And who's their teacher?  Who actually walks them through these courses?  It's just self taught?
L:  Ah, well, it sounds like it's partially self taught, you know, by the -- by the courses that they [NOISE] -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the parents [NOISE] -- 
R:  I see.
L:  -- but partially I as- -- I assume somebody, you know, there is actually -- 
R:  There is someone who -- 
L:  -- teachers that -- that -- 
R:  Well then in -- in that case you're getting the best of both worlds too.  That means it's almost like home schooling it almost sounds like. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Does it get a lot of, you know, parent involvement too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I don't know if we have it and I said I'm calling -- I'm from California and I don't know if there is something like that here or not. 
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I haven't heard of something like that but I do know that I notice nowadays a lot of their homework do require them to go on line and go to certain websites -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and you know, download information that way.  So, yeah, definitely, um, an improvement.  There is -- 
L:  Are -- 
R:  -- a lot more to be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- got. 
L:  So, [inaudible] they -- they require -- they allow either they can stay after school or [NOISE] -- or they're at libraries is what they -- because I assume there're some kids that don't have computers at home.  [LAUGH] 
R:  They do in school.  All the -- all the classrooms, at least at the school my kids go to, have an internet connection --  
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- in the classroom.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they all do get some sort of exposure at least -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- at school during [inaudible] hours.  I hear a little one there.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Someone is not happy.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I had to run upstairs to hide from my [inaudible] so -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  My kids are all downstairs.
L:  So, yeah, they -- so they also -- I know they also have games and stuff they can download here which are supposed to be like educational -- 
R:  Oh, yeah -- 
L:  -- games.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- absolutely.  That's -- that's a big thing.  I think that's what I use a lot right now.  Um, one of my children, she's really slow in math and, um, my mother's also a teacher and she gave me a lot of websites with -- th- that showed, ah, supplemental worksheets that I could do 'cause m- -- the teacher can only give so much and with the budget cuts and everything they really don't have much more that they can provide for the kids.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  So, I use that from home just to supplement and I'll, you know, so and I'll, you know, make up worksheets and even like spelling.  There are spelling lists and everything.  I can -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- actually put in the w- -- you know, there's spelling lists and it'll generate worksheets for them.
L:  [NOISE] That's nice.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Different crossword puzzles.  Things for them to make it fun so that, you know, they feel like they're learning and they're doing their work but in -- in a fun way.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah.  So, that makes it fun.  But, again I understand because not everyone might have access to that.  So -- 
L:  That is true -- 
R:  Yeah.  So, they can't really make it a requirement for everyone unless they do offer it into the classrooms -- 
L:  Yeah [several inaudible words].
R:  -- and it makes it a little bit easier.  Yeah, but, it's definitely a plus.  I mean, ah, even my little one, um, my two and four year olds are always -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- on line too on the computer and they've been learning things that, you know, my older ones didn't have access too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, again through playing all these games and the educational games.  So, it definitely -- 
L:  Yeah, how old is your oldest?
R:  My oldest is ten.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] -- 
L:  My oldest is five. 
R:  Oh, is five.
L:  Yeah, he'll only -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- start at kindergarten in September.
R:  Oh.  You looking forward to that?
L:  Yeah, somewhat.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] school.  Yeah, I've got seven kids so they range from ten all the way to a -- a little baby.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, go down.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, my youngest is --  
R:  -- yeah, it is important. 
L:  -- two.
R:  I've -- I'm sorry?
L:  My youngest is two.
R:  Is two.  I know that age.  Yeah.  Now, is he or she interested in the computer?
L:  Um, they're all somewhat interested in it, yes.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Their -- 
R:  They're at that age.
L:  -- favorite game to play is, like, Freddy Fisher stuff.
R:  Oh, well, see, those are -- those are fun for them. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're not at the stage where they're fighting.  See, I've got all kids on one computer so, needless to say, there's a lot of fighting going on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I always make sure that I, you know, am watching what games they're playing and I bookmark those games for them and those, you know, school websites and stuff for them -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to make sure that they're not wandering 'cause that's a real big issue for me -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- these days 'cause they could just, you know, type in one thing and then wind up somewhere else also.
L:  That is true.
R:  Yeah.  You know, you never really think about it 'til, well, you're confronted with it and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we've -- we've had that happen and you know, it's just something that you just have to kind of, you know, be involved right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kind of stay -- stay on top of things too but, yeah, it'll be a new experience for your -- I don't know, is it a son or a daughter that's five?
L:  Ah, they're -- they're -- I -- I've all boys.
R:  All boys.  Oh.  How is that? 
L:  It's okay.  I have three -- 
R:  Sorry?
L:  -- of them.
R:  Oh, you have three boys.
L:  Three boys.
R:  Good.  Good.  I've got two boys and I think that's two too many.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  My boys -- my girls, I mean, they're -- they -- they have their fights and stuff but they're still, they're a little bit more bearable than the boys.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The boys are the ones that are a lot more work to me but it should be fun.  It should be nice for 'em going to school and they'll get to experience a whole new world [inaudible].
L:  So, do they have lots of computers in your school or do they only have, like, one or two per classroom?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I mean, I've -- I haven't been in their classroom since the open house in the fall.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But from, you know, what my kids say, there's never been a problem with them going on line --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- whenever they want.  I know my daughter's a fifth grader and in her classroom, see there's about thirty four students, there's got to be maybe eight or twelve computers in there.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm sure they do -- they must do some sort of rotation -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where they might, you know, have different cycles and stuff and let, you know, a certain group be on it.  It maybe a certain day or a certain time of the day. 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't know exactly how that works but -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I've never heard her say, "Oh, you know, I didn't --" 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- get to go on" or something like that --" 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I -- [MN] I -- you know, I really [inaudible] -- I know that there isn't one per child.  That would just be unheard of but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I do know that they do have enough at least in the different classrooms.  My -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- other one's a fourth grader and same thing, he's got 'em and second graders too.  The younger ones they also get to, um, have exposure.  Ever since kindergarten they do put them -- and they have like different, um, what is that software, like CDs?  Different --  
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- um, like I remember in kindergarten my son had a bunch of these Arthur CDs that -- 
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- were actually like phonics and playing games and Arthur Goes To The Library and things like that where, um, they get to play games [several inaudible words].  It makes it fun for them.
L:  That's good.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah.  Times are changing.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, I remember [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] see what -- 
L:  -- is my [several inaudible words] when I was in school about the only thing they had was, um, they had, like, c- c- computer rooms.  So, you know, if you were going to [several inaudible words] computer [several inaudible words] they had a room -- 
R:  Right.  You'd have to go -- 
L:  -- where you'd go to -- 
R:  -- to the computer lab or something like that.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Exactly, yes.  Definitely you didn't have them in the classrooms.  Yeah -- 
L:  No, very rare.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and I don't think they gave us that exposure to that 'til maybe when I was in junior high school -- 
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- they -- they gave us, like, exposure a little bit to what computers are and -- and something like that but I didn't have any of that in elementary school.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's completely different.  So, it's -- it's -- it's okay.  You know, it'll -- it'll work out, hopefully, in -- 
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- um, I don't know what's going to happen next too, you know, as they get older 'cause my s- -- my one son who's in fourth grade right now, his teacher keeps telling him that when you get up into middle school and high school you -- you each need your own laptop because when you start writing reports, you just do it right there on your desk.
L:  What are --  
R:  I'm thinking, "Wow, what are they expecting?"  You know, not every parent can even afford things like that but -- 
L:  Well, [several inaudible words] [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- it'd become ridiculous.  I mean, how many people are going to buy a laptop for their kid? 
R:  Right.
L:  I mean -- 
R:  Oh, you'd be surprised.
L:  -- unless you're in a -- 
R:  Yeah, you'd be -- 
L:  Are you in a -- 
R:  -- really amazed, you know, how much -- oh, boy.  It -- it is.  It's -- you know, and I -- and I see 'em all the time and they're all, like, carrying their little own computer and -- 
L:  Are you in a high class -- 
R:  -- and now they have those little -- 
L:  -- neighbourhood?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Are you in a high class neighbourhood?  [LAUGH]  
R:  We live in San Diego.  Every -- ah, it's very -- 
L:  No, I mean, are you -- 
R:  -- expensive here.
L:  -- like, in a neighbourhood where -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- most of the houses are like a hundred, two hundred thousand dollars or something?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah, well, here in California everything -- I mean, we live in a very moderate sized home with four bedrooms.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's actually very small for us 'cause there's nine people in this family.  But, um, no houses are -- like, our house is about half a million.
L:  Oh, okay -- 
R:  That's because housing is very, very expensive.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I don't know if, um, Pennsylvania's different but I know Texas is really cheap but I don't know.  But, you know, it -- it doesn't matter.  I don't care how -- how much money my husband made.  I don't believe in spoiling a kid either, you know?  It's definitely not something that, um, I feel -- 
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- like, is necessary.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I don't feel like that would need that.  You can still use good old fashioned pencil and paper and you know, jot notes that way.  I -- 
L:  That's true.
R:  -- don't want them getting to that -- you know, like, they see kids and oh, well, you know, such and such has that and something but -- 
L:  Well, adults have -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- a problem because from what I understand the battery life is not that long either.  You know, the -- 
R:  The what life?  Oh, the battery life.
L:  -- battery life usually only lasts a few hours.
R:  I don't  know.  I don't know much about them to know exactly -- 
L:  I heard the battery life's only supposed to be a few hours on unless, of course -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you have an extension cord but obviously e- everybody in the whole class was -- 
R:  Yeah, get it out -- 
L:  -- getting out there -- 
R:  -- in the classroom, right.
L:  [LAUGH] And that was -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] --
