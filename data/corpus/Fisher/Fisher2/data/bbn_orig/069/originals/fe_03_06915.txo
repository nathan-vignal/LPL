R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Debbie.
R:  Hi, Debbie.  I'm Mary.
L:  Hi, Mary.
R:  Hi.  Okay, I guess we'll started.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um.
L:  Any other countries a threat, is that what it said?
R:  Yes.  Well, I think there are probably many um that would like to be a threat.  I think there are a lot of countries around the world that don't like the United States, but I don't know if they're able to, you know, if they pose a threat.  I think there are some, North Korea for one --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and Iran, I think, for another.  How about you, what do you think?
L:  I totally agree.  I um a- and I do think they pose a threat [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I think those countries do.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Right.  I do.  I um -- I'm sure that there's some other ones an- -- and with that in mind, smaller ones, that think they are a threat that are -- certainly are not --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and we've proven that obviously --
R:  Yes.
L:  But the -- the t- -- the countries that -- that harbor the terrorists I ah -- I feel are certainly a major threat.
R:  Well, that's it.  I mean, I -- I -- I think that was the danger with -- part of the danger with Iraq is that they would share some of their technology with groups like Al Qaeda --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know and you know, sell them nuclear ah components or -- or, you know, the whole done package and -- and -- and I think the President has you know, about a year a half ago, was it, when he was talking, when he first spoke of the axis of evil?
L:  Right.
R:  And everybody was all up in arms because, "Oh, how can you say that about North Korea and you're just provoking these people" and you know now that time has passed, we see -- we know now that what he was saying was in fact accurate.
L:  Well, and the unfortunate thing for us is that we're -- we're pretty well protected with not knowing the things that he would know, um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and -- and a lot of other people that are in the government do know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that you know we're -- we're just walking around happy, carefree and -- and lucky that nothing, you know, that we live in a- America and we're free and not suffering and so on, but I -- I've -- other than -- than probably um -- I don't know, I'm -- I'm a little concerned with France, as a matter of fact [LAUGH].
R:  Well, you know the one [MN] think I -- I bel- -- well, I think France is a concern because they're so weak and they're so anti American over there, or I -- I think at least the government is anti American --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- you know, it's hard to say what the run of the mill citizens feel, but um I -- I think though that with the way that they've run their country for the last decade is that they have enough problems of their own.  Their economy is horrible --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know and -- and I -- they're really teetering on becoming a socialist country which, you know, and I -- I mean, unemployment's high and inflation is high and -- and all these -- they have -- I think they have their own social ills, you know, that I don't know that they can [LIPSMACK] it's just, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they get together with somebody else --
L:  Right.  Well --
R:  -- you know, I --
L:  -- and -- and it would be a technological type of warfare, it wouldn't be -- wouldn't be combat as we -- as we know it or as we think of it.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, it would be sharing our secrets and -- and um chemical warfare and -- and those types of things, that's -- which we don't -- we really don't think a whole lot about [LAUGH] --
R:  No, we don't.
L:  -- I don't think.  I -- I mean, until nine eleven, we -- I don't think we ever really gave it a whole lot of thought [COUGH].
R:  Well, and you know this e- one ah a positive in this is the Eastern Bloc is the Eastern European countries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they've been under these dictatorships for so many years that now that they're not, they don't want any part of that nonsense, you know what I mean?
L:  Correct.
R:  They love the West, they love the United States and they -- they want democracy or they want a -- a, you know, a representative republic and so they've had enough of that oppression.
L:  Correct.
R:  And -- and that's good.  They're on the side of the United States and -- for the most part.  And I think that's very good.  Um, you know, I -- I think too that once Pales- Palestine has its own state and obviously Israel is going to have to surrender some of its um ah oh, gosh, what do you call 'em?  Not really territories, but some of their um settlements --
L:  Subsidiaries, whatever they are, yeah.
R:  Yeah, some of their settlements, I think that might -- that might help.  I think Yasser Arafat is on his way out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because he's just [MN] you know, he -- he's of no -- he's just a terrorist thug himself, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and now he's lost his mind even more, you know he --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- he -- he's just gone, so ...  And I think younger people ah who are educated with more of a Western philosophy and you know people, it's not like fifty years ago where people didn't know what was going on, I mean people are exposed to -- you know, you have the Internet and all these cable news and satellites and everything --
L:  And are much more educate- -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- much more [MN] mentally educated as well.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  The --
L:  Much more.  I mean, fifty years ago, all you did was build a [MN] a bomb shelter and that's -- that was your protection [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And h- -- and hope that those Russians didn't come or whatever, I mean e- just that's the way it was.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- yeah, the --
L:  But I mean, y- you just look at our -- our little, little children, I look at my grandchildren and what they're learning in school and how e- d- it's just a whole totally different world, um --
R:  It truly is.  And --
L:  -- so I -- I -- I do believe that they're a threat, e- back to the question, but -- but I do believe that we're in control as well.
R:  And I'm happy to see too that the majority, I believe the majority of the citizens of this country, are loyal Americans --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I mean we see these -- these crazy people marching in the streets, but I really think they represent such a minority.
L:  They do.
R:  You know --
L:  There's no doubt in mind they don't and that's why we -- that's all we see and it looks like it's a lot of people protesting and marching and have a knowledge about it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but they're not.
R:  [MN]
L:  I- it's a very minor, minor amount of people --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- considering the entire population, because the people that believe in what -- what's right are not marching [LAUGH].
R:  Exactly.
L:  They're going to do it.
R:  They're -- they're going to work --
L:  To take care of it.
R:  -- and paying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the taxes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so those crazy people can --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- you know, a- and I think ah I mean I'm very happy that we have a good president with um moral certitude and we don't have the distractions of affairs and all this nonsense --
L:  Right.
R:  -- going on, you know, we have a guy in there who's -- he's his own man, he's a strong, good man, he believes in God and e- he, you know, I mean I think we have a good leader.
L:  Absolutely.  There is no doubt in my mind.  And there you hit it on the head.  He's the leader [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  He -- he really is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And people, you can see how the tone of the country has changed just in two years.
L:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  Where before it was, oh my God, I -- I mean we could go on for that about decades, volumes --
L:  I know [LAUGH].
R:  -- about the last administration --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but th- w- 
L:  -- but they didn't ask us to do that, so [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, God.  But this man, I think he's well informed about these other countries as we -- like I said, his axis of evil speech --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, shows us that a year and a half ago he knew what these guys -- the cards these guys --
L:  North Korean.
R:  -- are holding before --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anybody and that's why I -- I'm loath to listen to a lot of criticism from, as you were saying, people who don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  They just don't have the information and --
L:  Well, and that's what we're going to see in the media because they're -- that's decide their own [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  They're on the wrong side and always will be, always have been and always will be.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're lo- -- I -- I mean that's the only way that we can gain our knowledge and I think as long as we stuck this on the leader of the country, the --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, the person in charge, then we're better for it and --
R:  And I think people are respective, whether they like him or they don't like him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or they think this or think he's trying to -- it's irrelevant.
L:  Right.
R:  People respect him.  They know he's honest and that he's acting in the best interests of the country and its citizens.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And so --
L:  And with that mind, then I do feel very safe.  I do not feel that they're a threat with that in mind --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but he's -- he's not going to be there forever.
R:  I know.
L:  So -- so there i- you know, there -- in my opinion there is a threat, but you know as long as we get our act together and -- and our young people understand this, you are going to take care of us old people [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  -- then we'll be okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's right.
L:  Everything in the world will be hunky dory.
R:  Yeah.  Yes.
L:  So, if we can stay focused on that, but um as far as other countries being a threat, that -- I -- I believe that they -- there are some, but I do believe that we can overcome that, and have, and will continue to, um --
R:  I mean, I think we have to mount a -- it's a vigorous fight for an extended period of time, you know, I -- I think we'd have a good start, but I think it's just -- even in our every day living, you know, to just be alert and watch and not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, not be a nervous wreck all the time, you know, but just be vigilant and appreciate our country.
L:  Exactly.  Be aware.  Just --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- just be aware of what, you know, the e- w- what exactly is going on a- and don't take it one hundred percent face value of what the media tells us, but you know pick it apart and under-
