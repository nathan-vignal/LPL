R:  [MN]
L:  Hello, this is Tracey.
R:  Hi, Tracey.  This is Sandy.
L:  Hi, Sandy.  So --
R:  How are ya?
L:  Good.  Have you done this before?
R:  Um, yes I have.  Is this your first time?
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  I can talk really well but I don't really know what to do. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  So, we just start talking about the topic or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Computers in education --
L:  Um --
R:  -- and what do you think?
L:  I think that computers are good.  I think that, um, there's a lot of jobs that deal with computers after they get out of schooling and I think it's going help the kids if they kinda have a handle on it before they leave school.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I definitely agree with that because I -- I mean, I know my niece is in school and she has a better grasp of computers than I ev- -- well, ever have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um, I think that she's definitely one step up against me, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ahead of me because I don't have that.  You know, I don't know --
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I'm -- I'm good enough to get by but I don't have any idea what I'm doing.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's -- well, I mean, when I was looking -- I relocated and I was looking at, um, jobs and half of them were, you know, computer literate or know at least Microsoft Word, you know, just to get around because it just seems like everybody's so automated these days that every -- all their files and all their client information, everything's on the computer and if someone has never even seen one before that's going to be additional labor for the companies to pay to train them before they can even start doing their job.
R:  Oh, yeah, and --
L:  And so --
R:  And, I mean, I -- I'm -- I'm good enough to know that, you know, if you -- if you sit me down and show me how to do something once I can do it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I mean, I don't have that, you know -- whereas my niece can sit down and go type, type, type, type, type and she just, like, starts doing whatever it is.  It's like, "How do you know how to do that?"
L:  [LAUGH] Trial and error. [LAUGH]
R:  And she's twelve, you know.
L:  Twelve years old. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my god, [LAUGH] oh, my god that is -- that's great.  She is -- I mean, [MN] were computers even around [LAUGH] when you were twelve?
R:  No, well, see that's the problem.  Like, my husband's five years younger than I am --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he was -- he's -- he's a computer programmer, that's what he does for a living, and for him, like, they started only having computers when he was young.  It's like I remember when I was going to college that I'd hear like, "And we have these new computer labs".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like, "Ooh, what's a computer lab?"
L:  I know, you --
R:  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  You would just go in there to type a letter and then you're out.  I know they were teaching us how to program, I don't know what classes I was taking, the last -- I think it was the last couple of years of college and, I mean, you ask me to do basic or it was, uh, DOS, they were teaching us something about DOS and I thought, great, we created a -- I was taught how to, uh, make this picture of a -- of a kid fishing through DOS by putting the -- you know the Xs and the Os --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the ones and the twos and everything in the right places and go to here and go to ... and I could not do that today but now it seems like they're teaching more usable -- or not usable, you know, things that people can really use, useful things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, unless you're going to go on and become a programmer, I mean, I don't need to know how to [LAUGH] create a picture --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, I mean, that was showing us how it works and I guess people that are really interested in that, that got 'em excited, they would go on, you know, and -- and learn more about it.  To me, I was like if I can type a letter that's going to suit me fine and internet didn't --
R:  Oh, yeah, I still -- I'm still --  
L:  I didn't even learn the internet until about three years ago.
R:  Yeah, the -- the whole internet thing, I don't know, it's just like [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I -- everybody says it's really -- really good but it seems like there's so many pitfalls.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, there's so much that's not good about it and especially for children.  Like, I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there needs to be more -- like, this -- I think this pop up crap --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just should not even be allowed.  They should not be able to pop up and then a kid accidentally links to something that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- totally disgusting and perverted, you know.
L:  Exactly, I -- just, the -- the --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- email that you get.
R:  Oh, I -- I -- I -- it -- it -- it galls me then that the people even get my email address and some of the stuff I don't even op- -- I can't even open it, it's like, ooh! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you don't want to --
R:  You don't want to run your mouse over it --
L:  You don't want to open it. [LAUGH]
R:  -- because you're like, uh, like, "Ooh, what's that?"
L:  It's true, it's true, I -- so, I mean, I guess, I don't know, if they [SIGH] -- but also, you know, if they -- when -- I mean, the only con that I can see, because I totally think it's a pro if they teach kids in school because I -- it's life, you know.  People are [LAUGH] going to need computers when they grow up but they're going to make 'em smarter and they're going to get 'em to know how to work around things and get where they want, even with parents, you know, advisories and everything and, you know, us looking over 'em, if they're a lot smarter on the computer they can get around that.  And like you're saying your husband's a programmer, my -- mine's a computer tech so he basically fixes everything to do with a computer and he knows how to get in and out of programs and hack and everything, you know, and -- and I'm -- because he's been on it so much --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's knowledgeable and if these kids come out --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- twelve years old and they know the basics, what are they going to be like when they get in their twenties?
R:  Oh, I know, I know.  My -- my husband's like, buh, buh, buh, he does whatever and like I call him like a help desk.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I'll -- I'll be doing something at home and I'll call him and I'll be like, "Okay, I have this weird box in the middle of the screen".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "What does it say?", you know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know, and you read it off to 'em --
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they go, "Oh, do this or that".
R:  Yeah, and he just -- it's like, "Oh, don't worry about it --"
L:  And we're like, "Okay".
R:  "-- just click on it".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm like, "Oh really, it's not going to hurt anything?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He always says, "You know, there's nothing you can do to this computer that I can't fix".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm like, "Well --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- I don't know about that". [LAUGH]
L:  "Yeah, but will I lose everything?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Wait, wait -- oh, there's -- oh, um, hey, I'm not supposed to get off the phone but there's somebody here.  What do I do?
R:  Oh, I -- I don't know.
L:  Um --
R:  I [MN] --
L:  -- where is my [NOISE] -- my cordless isn't even anywhere. [NOISE] I've never done this and now there's someone at my front door.
R:  Oh.
L:  Can I lay the phone down for a second or what ...?
R:  Yeah, go ahead and run.
L:  Okay, thanks.
R:  Okay. 
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm like, "What do I do?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I'm supposed to talk for ten minutes.
R:  This is a -- it's like -- it's a really -- this is a really neat concept, like, you know, to talk to strangers, I don't know.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  I, uh, um -- I'm very chatty anyway so [several inaudible words].
L:  I know, [LAUGH] that's me, too, so, I know --
R:  You know, it's like, "Oh, this is kinda neat".
L: -- "Sure, pay me ten bucks, sure I'll talk".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but this is the first time I've ever --
R:  I was like, "Mm, I'll get paid to do this.  Yeah, this is great". [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Last time, last couple of times but they were never connected, I was never connected to anybody.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, I waited and I waited and waited and then I just hung up so --
R:  Oh see I haven't -- I haven't gotten -- I haven't got a call in a couple of days so --
L:  Oh, they -- they were calling me every single day for there while -- a while and then this is the first one I've gotten in a couple of days so ...
R:  Oh, it's a lot of fun, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  They got some interesting topics, too.  Like this --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think this is a pretty mellow topic.
L:  Yeah, there's -- I mean, it's pretty --
R:  You know, like, computers.  You know, it's like who -- who's go -- who's going to say, "No, they don't like computers in schools"?
L:  No.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  I -- I mean, that's the only thing I could think of is they're going to be too smart. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, that --
L:  Too smart for our own good. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, it's like they're going to have computerized people taking care of us when we're old.
L:  Yeah, I mean, oh gosh, we're probably going to be hooked up to computers and --
R:  Yes that's the only -- that's the only thing that creeps me out, like, the -- you know, the technology gets to be too bizarre.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, like I don't want to have my iris scanned to get in my house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, or, I -- or, you know, I don't want to have to carry a little -- little computer chip that has all my information on it.  Like that's kinda creepy.
L:  Right, yeah, I don't think any of it should go that far.
R:  You know, like somebody could steal your identity.  You know, you know --
L:  And we'll lose our--
R:  -- it's just, like, so weird.
L:  Lose our humanity, you know, it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- no, this is people.  I mean we're [LAUGH] -- we just need to know how to function.  You know what scares me is just [MN] everything being on the computer and things get wiped out and you know, like, nine eleven, everything in that -- those buildings got wiped out but maybe, you know, the only good thing was, you know, those comp- -- those companies, all their paper was gone, you know, but maybe it was left on a computer system, you know, and the computer systems are gone and everything but, I don't know, I -- that's the only thing that's good about computers.  Uh, one thing that's good about computers there's always a back up somewhere.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I was wondering how did they -- they lost all their employees, they lost all of their -- their paperwork, they lost all their computers, wh- -- how does, I mean like it's completely wiped off the face of the earth, as -- you know, the business, so I was just wondering if there was a back up in a computer.  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, I -- I mean, I -- my husband and I was fir- -- were first dating when -- when two thousand came around and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And he had to work New Year's Eve into New Year's Day, you know, like a --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Like -- like almost twenty four hours and they all had to be at work just in case because he worked for -- like, they do the computer systems for hospitals and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and god forbid something would have happened --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, for a hospital, which nothing did but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, like that -- that whole thing is just kinda creepy and scary --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, 'cause I think sometimes it does get a little bit too -- you know, it's like you can't -- you can't have certain things --
