R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name is Mariette.
R:  My name is Tammy.
L:  Okay.
R:  Are you the -- 
L:  What's next?
R:  I'm sorry, ah, the topic is computers in education. 
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, I think they're very helpful.
L:  Yes.
R:  I appeal[?] that the longer, you know, the more kids can learn the smarter they're going to be at the -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- beginning of their -- you know, the quicker you get to them age wise is the faster, you know, the faster they're going to learn, the more -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- the more it's, ah, easier for them to learn.
L:  Yes, I agree with you.  I think computers, um, are very helpful and are used to, ah, increasingly in many -- many kinds of jobs.  I'm a nurse and I use computers.  Um, although I -- I'm not trained to use computers in the home, I use them at work [several inaudible words] computerized settings, um, and they're very accurate, ah, for drug counts, um, or, er, ah, for computerized near the end of the shift or -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, just --
R:  What kind of work do you do?
L:  I'm a registered nurse.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  Yeah, ah, or -- 
R:  I'm an accountant so I use a computer all day also and then I find myself on it -- I'm on it all evening at -- at home also.
L:  I see.
R:  But -- 
L:  Do you have a computer at home?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, do you use it for busin- business or pleasure?
R:  Just pleasure.
L:  I see.
R:  Yeah, I'm looking for a home business but, ah, for right now it's just for pleasure at home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I use it at work all day long.
L:  I see.
R:  You know, but I've found even my nine year old nephew knows more than I do about the computer.
L:  Yeah, that's amazing, ah -- 
R:  When he was about five he put in [inaudible] software --  
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- himself and run programs and -- 
L:  Well, that's wonderful.
R:  Yeah, he's pretty intelligent.  He just puts -- puts in the disk and lets it go and he knows everything to do.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- well, I want to go to a class but I don't have time because mostly I work in the evening --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I don't have the time to go to a class.  But, when I do go I -- I want to go and get into some kind of business on the computer and, um, see what kind of money I can make.
R:  Right, ah, I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think it's wide open but it's just confusing knowing what to do.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and there's -- I mean, there's just so many things, like on the internet but -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you don't know what's a true business and whether it isn't.  So -- 
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  I mean, I didn't start using a computer in school until I was probably a sophomore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, now they're starting in kindergarten [LAUGH] in seems like --
L:  Oh, that's amazing.
R:  So, you know, ah, my other nieces and nephews they're in, like, first grade, second grade.  They know how -- they can play their games.  They put the disk in, start it themselves.  So --  
L:  That's amazing.
R:  It's -- it's unreal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they definitely seem to know and I think, you know, if it wasn't for being taught at school, they would have no idea.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  You know, and I look at my mother.  She h- has no clue -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- of how to even turn a computer on much less get on the internet -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and you know, she said she wants to purchase a computer but she'll use it only for playing games probably.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because that's all she knows how to do.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's still something.
R:  Right.  That's what I told her.  At least that's a start but -- 
L:  Yes, it's a start.
R:  -- you know, I go to my aunt's house and that's what she does and she emails but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, her grandson knows more than she does.  So -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and then she says, "Teach me".  Well, you can't just teach a person, you know?  [NOISE] It's like she wants me to show her everything all in one step.
L:  Yes.
R:  So -- 
L:  I tried to take a class some time ago, ah, through, um, ah, what is it?  Um, it was a free class, ah, given by the state or something --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I didn't learn anything because -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- um, whenever I got there, I got there too late for whatever she said and, ah, she just put it up on a board what she wanted us to do and she just got busy on the computer herself and so I didn't learn anything.  So, I just stopped going.
R:  Yeah, it all depends on your teacher because I took classes in my job and the instructor was excellent.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  When we went to work -- I went to a Windows class I pretty much knew what -- everything that she had taught anyway so once -- 
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  -- I got into -- once I got into Excel and Word, you know, she was very, you know, able to teach me a lot and I've used a lot of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me -- in my work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where do you -- you live?
L:  I live in Anaheim, California.
R:  Oh, really?  I -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- live in Ohio [several inaudible words].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yeah, in Ohio.
L:  Yeah, that's interesting.
R:  Very neat.  Very neat.  How long have you -- 
L:  Are you married?
R:  Pardon?
L:  Are you married?
R:  No, I'm not.
L:  Oh, no, I'm not married either.
R:  Have you done this long?
L:  No.  Today's my first day.
R:  Me too.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I just happened to find it on the internet and I thought, "Oh, why not?"
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, and so -- 
L:  I see.
R:  -- and it's my first try to -- so I had no idea what to expect and what [NOISE] I -- I just -- I really didn't know anything about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I just happened to come across it on a website.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  How did you find out about it?
L:  I saw it in an advertisement in a newspaper.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And, um, a news- -- ah, ah, what you call a city newspaper.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Gotcha.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I happened to find it on a website and I didn't even know if it was selective or not and I didn't know when it would start, ah, so I was kind of shocked when I saw it on the caller ID.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, it's -- it's, funny -- 
L:  I -- I'm surprised that I started today because I just registered today.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, they said, ah, it would start within twenty four hours.
R:  I -- 
L:  I thought it would start tomorrow.
R:  I think I registered yesterday.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  For Saturday.  No -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's probably yesterday.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I -- so, I didn't even know.  I -- I had no idea when it would start and when it wouldn't.
L:  Did they ask you to punch in your PIN?
R:  No.
L:  No, they -- they gave me a PIN --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but they didn't ask me to punch in.
R:  Right.  I think if you dial in then they -- they ask you to punch in a PIN -- 
L:  Oh, I see, yes.
R:  -- is how I understood it -- 
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  If they call -- from the email I got today.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  But, if -- ah, if they call you then you just talk. 
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  But, I don't know how you know when the time is up.
L:  No, they said that they will cut you off -- 
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  -- ah, right away, ah, when the time -- time is up.
R:  I understand.
L:  So, I think we still have a couple of minutes.
R:  Right, it's -- yeah --  
L:  Yeah.  So, um, what else can you talk about computers?
R:  Um, what -- do you use a computer at home or work?
L:  No, I don't have a computer.  I'm a nurse and we use computers at work.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so it's -- it's very specific.  Oh, I -- although I know what to do at work, I -- I wouldn't know what to do if I had a computer at home.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, see I use my computer at home every night.  I go on the internet every night. 
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  I do, um -- I have spread sheets, you know, and I -- like I said, I didn't start even learning the computer until I was in high school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And well, that was twenty years ago, you know?
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  So, I've just been through college.  I started to learn a little bit and then basically I taught myself the rest just by having one at home and -- 
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  -- you know, friends would say, "Try this and check this out" and -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so -- now, what do you use it for at your work?
L:  Well, we use it to count drugs or, um -- it's very accurate.  Um, there are no mistakes.  Oh, but if it -- if -- if we have to --
R:  [NOISE] 
L: -- in the hospitals where there are no computers there's also always come a possibility of making mistakes --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and [inaudible] out the wrong drug --
R:  Right.  [NOISE] 
L:  -- but when you have a computerized, um, ah, [several inaudible words], ah -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- then there is no mistake because you type in the name, you type in the drug and then you get the exact drug that you type in.
R:  And you -- you keep track by each patient -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- than what -- what is used?
L:  What?
R:  You keep track of -- by each patient?
L:  Yeah, you t- type in the patient's name and you type in the patient's drug.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's accurate.
R:  So, then that should tell you how much you've used and how much --
L:  Right.  Right.  Absolutely. 
R:  -- you should have left.  I understand.
L:  Absolutely, yeah -- 
R:  I understand.  [MN] Yeah, but -- 
L:  Its -- it's very easy, ah, at work because well [several inaudible words] to use it -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, ah, you don't have to count drugs at the end of the shift.  In hospitals where it -- it's not computerized, it's a pain to have to count all these different drugs -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- about twenty different drugs.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  But, um, the -- the Pixes[?] that's w- -- that's what it's called, ah, it's already counted.  It's counted immediately.
