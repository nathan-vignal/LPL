R:  Hi, my name is Sandy. [PAUSE] Is someone there?
L:  Hi, Sandy.  I'm Jim.
R:  How are you today?
L:  Good.  How about yourself?
R:  Oh, I'm great, thank you so much.  Where are you from?
L:  Live in San Antonio, Texas.  
R:  Oh.
L:  How about you?
R:  Oh, wow.  I'm over here in, um, Burtonberg[?], South Carolina. 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Beautiful part of the country.
R:  Yeah, well, I can -- can't say I've ever been to Texas, but it is pretty here.
L:  [LAUGH] We're getting some, ah -- ah, I hope we don't get disconnected, but getting --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a, ah, a very, very, very severe thunder storm right now.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, my.  We've -- [NOISE] we've had such things in the area.  And I know what you mean.  Right.  We haven't lately but the [NOISE] weather just hasn't straightened up yet.  So --
L:  Some very badly needed rain, my -- I might add.  We -- we need the rain but we don't need the wind. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I know.  We have had a lot of wind here, too.
L:  Have you?
R:  Yeah.  A lot.  I don't know what's going on but it's not gotten very hot and it's been very, very, very windy like sometimes[?] thirty mile an hour winds and, you know, pretty  --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- extensive.
L:  [SIGH] W- we've been very hot and very dry.
R:  Hot and dry [NOISE] hm.  Wow.  [NOISE] So, education is their topic today and we're earning, ah, ten dollars for a little chitchat?
L:  That's [LAUGH] in -- ah, did you see it?  Did you watch any of this weather on your computer?
R:  Um, no, actually, I didn't.  But I did, um, check the temperature quite often on the computer and I have done a lot of research with it.  You know, which is very helpful.  How about you?
L:  Um, I -- I signed up for that -- do you -- have you gotten that Weather Bug alert on your computer?
R:  I did.
L:  Ye- yeah.  Ah, I -- I was catching all the weather alerts today.
R:  Mm.  I liked Weather Bug a lot but I +had problems, I think, that were related to it.  So, I'd uninstalled it and it seemed to get better.  But ...
L:  Oh.  What kinda problems were you having?
R:  Yeah.  I really honestly couldn't tell you 'cause it was quite some time ago. 
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I've not regotten[?] it but, um, you know, there's always a program here or there that seems to be more effective or less effective --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from computer to computer, around.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  So, what made you looking around to earn a buck online?
L:  I was looking for, ah, interesting part time jobs.
R:  Oh, [NOISE] well, that's great.  I hear you there.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know, this is a interesting, um, with this topic of education and I really still haven't figured out what it is they're accomplishing by taping conversations?
L:  I -- I think it's the art of conversation itself.  It's not so much, ah, the topic or anything else.
R:  Oh, you do, do ya?  
L:  I think so.  What do you think?
R:  I'm honest to gosh, haven't even come to any kinda of conclusion except, boy, that's confusing.  I wonder what the heck they're doing with that information. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And what good is the art of conversation as far as what they're studying? [PAUSE] Maybe they're teaching with it.
L:  Maybe.  
R:  Which would work great in the education department, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is my --
L:  Do you, what --
R:  -- second call.  How many calls have you had?
L:  Oh, this is my first one.  
R:  Is it? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You were going to say?
L:  Oh, oh, um, what kinda work do you do?
R:  Well, I don't exactly do work but I'm, like, more or less a -- a wife and homemaker and I also manage the two properties we previously lived in.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  So, and, yeah.  Try to save money and manage the money he makes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  What do you do?
L:  Zookeeper.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  How interesting.  My -- my daughter would love to talk to you.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  She loves animals like no tomorrow and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the only reason she won't be a vet is because there might be blood involved.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm -- when I was her age, I probably said the exact same thing.  But, ah, um, you -- you get used to it.  
R:  Yeah.  I would think so.  She's only ten so she's got plenty of time to realize that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And become a vet anyway.
L:  Sure.  
R:  So ...  So, do you have kids?
L:  [PAUSE] Ah, just four legged ones.
R:  Dogs or cats, or --
L:  Yes.  Hm.
R:  -- ferrets or something like that, huh?
L:  Dogs and cats.
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  And birds.  
R:  Ahah, we had birds once, twice.  I'd better say, three times.  I like birds a lot, the only problem I had with them is they're kinda squawky sometimes [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so, you -- you need to have a room special just for them, I think. [LAUGH] Unless your tolerance is really high or you just really love to throw the blanket on.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, well, I -- I guess being around them all the time, I -- ah, you tune them out after a while, I guess. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, they never really bother me.
R:  Well, that surely helps, definitely.  Um, I know I sure learned a lot having them because they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- un- unbelievably, would chew on just about anything if they had a chance and I just never would have thought they would have done such things and --
L:  Oh, yes. [COUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You must have had some fairly large birds then?
R:  Um, yeah.  We had a cockatiel.
L:  Oh, yeah, okay.
R:  And cockatiels and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they're interesting.
L:  That ain't nothing.  
R:  Nothing?
L:  Bigger birds chew a lot more than that.
R:  Oh, do they?
L:  Oh, yes.  
R:  Mm.  Well, I didn't have 'em that big then.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They get expensive up there, you know, and must needed -- needed, ah, to do something, to make more money but I think I'll send the kids to college.  We've got two, with the two different properties, so ... I have decided that, you know, on the stock market may not make you any money but, um, property's probably pretty, you know, if you can handle -- handle the work involved, property will -- pretty lucrative.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, my husband's very handy, so that makes it very helpful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  He's pretty --
L:  So, you -- you -- are you all, um, renting out your old residences?  Is that what you're doing?
R:  Exactly.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We have a property --
L:  And you plan your --
R:  -- up in Wisconsin, a two flat.  That was our first purchase and when we moved down here, we mo- -- purchased another home.  And we still rent it out up there.  And, ah, we've rented that out and purchased.  What I said to him would be, you know, probably the last home I buy.  At least, for me to live in. [NOISE] 
L:  Yeah.  And you find your --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your [PAUSE] people who lease your homes, or your other properties, you find those on your computer?
R:  I have tried.  But, [COUGH] excuse me, I don't think that it's very easy to yet.  I think it's something that's up and coming.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I have listed my properties on several websites like sublet dot com and such, and I think, it's going to be coming and I further think a person like yourself or myself could easily sell a property online nowadays.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But renting it is a little bit more difficult.  I think people are still looking in the newspaper, more so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- than they are at, you know, like reel through a dot com or other such websites to find a rental property. 
L:  Yeah.  Well, ma- maybe, yeah.  Maybe it is a work in progress because it gets confusing, um, get into those real estate companies and you try to find rental property and it's just not there.  But you go into sites like, ah, rent dot com or for rent dot com and there's a couple of other ones, and it's mostly -- well, it's almost all apartments but they -- they say they do occasionally have rental homes.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- and so maybe it's just lack of knowledge or lack of experience, at this point, that people aren't looking in the right place.
R:  I think.  I mean it, ah, I really believe you could list [inaudible] if you felt you're very serious about selling and it was going to be very worth your while to sell at a, you know, say, a really easily sell -- sold at price.  You know, um --
L:  Ah, are you talking about selling or renting?
R:  Yeah, if you were trying to sell, you could easily sell, I think, but, yeah, renting is a lot harder because there's just not a lot of people looking online yet for a rental property.  I don't believe.
L:  And part of that could be the economy right now, as well.
R:  It could be.  Yeah.  I suppose.  If people are either buying or otherwise they're just plain and simple not moving.
