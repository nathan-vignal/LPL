L:  Hi, I'm Rayna[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Laura.
L:  How are you [LAUGH]?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where you at?
R:  I'm in Connecticut.  Where are you?
L:  Okay, in Texas [LAUGH].
R:  Wow.  This is weird.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this your first call?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  This is only my second, so [LAUGH].
R:  Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about foreign relations?
L:  Yes.  [LIPSMACK]  Well, um --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I really don't know a whole lot.  My husband's in the military, so that kind of helps [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he says that he thinks that [NOISE] Syria I believe --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- is a problem, um, 'cause that's where he thinks that the [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] oh, goodness, what's his name?  Um, [NOISE] --
R:  I don't know the President's name, but isn't that the country where [inaudible] Powell was recently, he visited?
L:  Yes, I think so.
R:  Yes.  I don't even know where Syria is.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  To be honest with you.  Um, I think Korea, North Korea.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, for the obvious reasons --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the nuclear reasons.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  And what else?
L:  Do you think we'll --
R:  Um --
L:  -- do anything about Korea?
R:  I don't -- I think that we'll negotiate with them and unless they make a direct threat, which they have before, but I don't --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't know, now that they're -- I think they just like -- they withdrew from the treaty and they're going to start testing things, so I'm not -- I don't even want to think about [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  Yeah, my husband says that he doesn't think we'll -- we'll ever fight them because they have ah a larger army and to --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- actually go to -- yeah.  And the- -- they're very, they don't fight by rules or anything, they're just very mean and [SIGH] [NOISE] they wouldn't fight like according to the Geneva Convention or anything --
R:  Yeah, absolutely not.
L:  -- so they wouldn't -- yeah, there wouldn't be any fair fighting or anything, so I think that we'd try and avoid it if -- if we can.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, that's what I think.  Avoidance, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] what other countries?  I don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know of any -- I don't think there are really that many countries that are a threat.
L:  Well, I think quite a few countries are kinda getting upset now with the fact that we haven't found anything in Iraq --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since there was supposed to be all these [NOISE] chemical weapons and stuff and now nothing has turned up --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  So, I think that --
R:  -- also see how they're covering their butts by saying, you know, that it was probably there but they destroyed it and --
L:  Yeah.  Destroyed it or moved it or yeah [NOISE].
R:  Mhm.  So, I don't --
L:  I don't know.  I think that might cause some problems.
R:  Yeah.  Um, did the question have to do with just war, or was it also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like terrorists, 'cause --
L:  Um I think it was just countries um --
R:  Like a threat to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't really know that much about -- I mean, I studied politics in school, but I don't really know all that much about the different countries.  I think any communist country also is a threat to us even though they're not going to do anything, I don't think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So [LAUGH] 
L:  So.
R:  Um, China --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they're not going to do anything, so [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Iran's too concerned about trade and our money, so I think that they --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- they won't do anything --
L:  The US does help a lot --
R:  -- unless -- yeah --
L:  -- with everybody.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't think we need to get a whole lotta enemies, they -- that wouldn't be good for the um countries.
R:  No.  I'm surprised people haven't ganged up on us, but --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  I'm really surprised.
L:  Well, I guess they kinda do, but once we get one enemy, we get another ally, so ...
R:  True.
L:  It just kinda keeps working out.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm actually not an American citizen, I'm from Ireland, so it's --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I mean I've lived here most of my life, but --
L:  Huh.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Well, that's interesting.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, sorry.  My cellphone often cuts out, so, I'm worried that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm going to cut off and not going to g- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to make it through the whole call.  Um, I don't know what else I could talk about for eight minutes [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  About foreign relations.  Um, [LAUGH].
L:  Let's see [LAUGH].  What is the first thing that we just -- not Osama Bin Laden ...
R:  Saddam Hussein?
L:  There you go [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Him.  They were saying that he flew to Syria or something.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  And so -- yeah.  So, that we might go -- well, I think it might be more of an excuse, just like attacking Iraq, um, it would just give us an excuse to attack Syria, but --
R:  Really?
L:  -- that's what they're --
R:  Are they neighboring countries?
L:  I think so.
R:  Oh, really?  I never -- I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I don't know for sure [LAUGH].
R:  And um --
L:  But yeah.
R:  -- and I think there's a l- -- there's a lot -- probably a lot more countries that plan on doing something, but they're not going to come out and say it right away.
L:  Oh, of course.
R:  Because then we jump on them and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so --
L:  And I think the US -- I think there is a whole lot more political stuff to this war than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever's said.
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  I don't think that there was really a whole lot of chemical weapons or anything, I think it was something more to do with the oil or something else like that --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  It's just such an odd situation that I see this -- I mean, I -- I'm pretty much American, by most standards, but I just kind of like -- I hear things from my family and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my cousins and things and they're Irish and they're a neutral country and they really hate Americans just because they hear a lot of rumors and then I -- they tell me that I don't know what's going on because the American government's not telling us the whole story and that makes me so nervous that all --
L:  See, and my husband works for the government and I don't think that we get --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't even think that them in the government get the whole story, I think that there's a whole lot of political parties at the very top that just kind of use the government, the military and everything as their little ponds for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatever they feel like going to war for at that time [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It worries me because I think a lot of Europe also resents us.  I mean, I think they hate us in a lot of ways because I know my cousins hate Americans just because they're like, "You're so ignorant to the whole -- everything that's going on in the world" but they think they're smarter and I can't -- I sometimes can't tell if it's because --
L:  Well.
R:  -- they aren't getting the whole story, or maybe it really is us that's not getting the whole story and --
L:  Or maybe a little bit of both.
R:  Pr- -- yeah, definitely a little bit of both.  But it's just so -- it's like we've had debates about it before and I'm like, you're so wrong, and they're like, "No, you really -- you really have no idea what's going on in the world" and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it makes me really upset.  But --
L:  Well.  I don't know.  I think the US is way too open with the rest of the world.  I think that we need to focus more on our own economical problems and homeless and everything else and stop worrying about --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- what all the other countries are doing and how their presidents are ruling them and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If the people don't like it, leave.
R:  Hm.  What --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- division of the military ah is your husband in?
L:  He's in First Cav[?].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Mm.  Um --
L:  Supposed to go to Iraq in December.
R:  Oh, he is?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, he wasn't there before?
L:  No.  Um --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  No.  They just go their orders cancelled like right before because everything ended so quickly.
R:  Oh, thank God. [LAUGH]
L:  But supposedly we're working on helping them rebuild their --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- government to our standards or whatever, so ... 
R:  Mhm.
L:  They're p- -- planning on sending um like trade outs still --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so, he might have to go over in December to do peacekeeping and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.  Um --
L:  I think that's another thing.  I think that we did our job in getting Saddam Hussein out; now we need to let their country build their government how they want it, not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not how we think it should be done.
R:  True.  And do you think that would be like by a vote?
L:  [NOISE] I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I don't think the people that live there now have enough sense, or have enough like realization how to pick somebody that would run the country.  It's just very -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's such an odd situation that the -- we kind of went in done like destroyed everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we don't know where Saddam is, we don't know where Osama Bin Laden is --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and now we're kind of like --
L:  Isn't that horrible? [LAUGH]
R:  -- we're kind of just like, Okay, that's -- like, it happened and I was like, "Oh, my God, we're going to war, this is huge" and it's over within like maybe a month --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or two and it just seemed like everything's back to normal for us, even after September eleven, like I -- everything's just back to normal.
L:  Everybody just forgets so quickly.
R:  Yeah.  And no one cares.  And everyone just turned into like patriotic people for like a few years and then it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- kind of like when I was just --
L:  Everybody just --
R:  -- watching a show about September eleventh and I got all upset.  And I'm like, but you know what?  It doesn't really matter anymore because everything's back to normal --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and even after this war, everything's back to normal, like French people don't -- don't hate us anymore --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's crazy.
L:  The freedom fries and freedom toast.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.  [LAUGH] Come on.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought that that was the most retarded thing I have ever heard in my whole life [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It is.  And people were like not going to French restaurants because I w- -- I live -- I work in New York City and I went to a French restaurant with my parents and there was no one there and my mom's like, "Oh, my God, we shouldn't have come here".  Like --
L:  It is a- -- that is absolutely insane.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're going to like punish -- how are you going to go through the government and actually change the name of food because it has another country's name in it that we're not getting along with right then?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  It is crazy.  We --
L:  I think our government is very childish [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  There's a lot of crazy people in this country.  But --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So ... um [SIGH] I'm trying to think of any other countries and because I don't know a lot of background, I could just be like, well North Korea.  I don't know all the story behind it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can't really talk to it, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know --
R:  What do they use this for?  This information.
L:  I have no clue.  [LAUGH]
R:  How did you find out about this?  Just change the topic for a second?
L:  There was a -- there was a website on just a website
