L:  Hello, I'm Ginger. 
R:  Hi, I'm Marla.
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How're you doing?
L:  Okay.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  Um -- 
L:  Good.
R:  -- now, just before we start I just -- I had -- initially I had a call once where I got a different topic than the person that I talked to once I -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- got -- yeah.  So, I just want to make sure that your topic that you heard was computers in education.
L:  Yes.  Okay -- 
R:  Okay, good.
L:  Huh, that's -- 
R:  'Cause I -- 
L:  -- strange.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  So, we just didn't finish the call but, um, [MN] there again -- so, you have your initial thoughts?
L:  Um, well, I don't know.  My husband, ah, works in the computer industry and [SIGH] I don't -- [SIGH] I don't really get the question, I guess.  It's computers in education?
R:  Yeah, and I guess they said do you -- do we feel like it helps education or it harms education?
L:  [MN] Oh, like having computers in school and stuff?
R:  Su- sure, I guess so.
L:  You think that's what they mean?  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think it's great.  I mean, ah, they -- they've got to learn to -- to be out in the world.
R:  Sure, I mean -- 
L:  You know -- 
R:  -- I, um --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- when I was in school -- I graduated at high school.  I went to ninety and they had just barely started even offering -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- computer courses.  But, you know, just the last decade you just -- 
L:  Right.  Yeah.  I graduated in eighty nine.
R:  -- you have to really know what you're doing.  An- anybody who would be graduating today I would suppose would be at a really big disadvantage if they only knew what I knew [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I graduated.  So --
L:  Yeah, I graduated -- 
R:  -- as far as -- 
L:  -- in ninety.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I didn't take any computer courses in high school I don't think.
R:  Right.
L:  And -- but I do remember in middle school they offered a class and it was, like, on the Apple two E. --  
R:  Keyboarding.
L:  -- ah -- no, no.
R:  Oh.
L:  This was a computer class.
R:  Yeah.  But -- 
L:  When I was in -- 
R:  -- did it teach you how to type?
L:  No.
R:  'Cause we did -- we did -- we learnt -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- on some Apple program how to type in a media center.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was fun.  But, it was on the computers but that's all we learnt how to do.  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh.  No, this, um, ah, it was learning how to write programs and stuff.
R:  Oh, really.  Ah.
L:  Like line ten, run, blah blah.  I mean, line twenty.  And it was teaching us how [LAUGH] to do that.  I was -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- like -- I mean, I don't know if -- if that was offered all over the place or what.  But -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or if we were like a test.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Maybe so.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, it seems like, um, you know, that there's a lot to -- a lot of advantages to the computers just because if they -- if the class -- if the students have access to the internet a big advantage of that is that you can get so much information just from what spot -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, rather than having to go to the library and find the right books with the right, you know -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- check them all out and do all the research like that.  It just -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- seems that the internet would make -- make it faster and easier.
L:  Yeah.  I -- 
R:  But a disadvantage, like -- 
L:  -- remember getting out the old en- encyclopedias.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right.
L:  Yuck -- 
R:  I don't even know of people old enough [LAUGH] any more -- 
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  We had -- 
L:  More salesmen.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] Now, the disadvantage that I would see of that especially with -- with older kids like, you know, teenagers is that if I was a parent I would be con- -- I know that here where I live in Virginia there, um, the schools -- some of the schools in one of the counties around us, um, every student at high school has their own laptop.
L:  Wow.
R:  Which seems kind of neat to some degree.  But, I would -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- be concerned that my -- that my teenager have just access -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to anything.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, 'cause there's -- 
L:  They -- they own the laptops?
R:  -- so much -- there's so much -- they -- well, it's -- it's issued by the school and I -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I guess they -- I don't think they get to keep it forever.  They probably have to return it at the end of the year but they -- 
L:  Golly.
R:  -- they keep it with them.  They take it home.  They take it to all their classes.
L:  Whoa.
R:  And I'm sure there's a lot of advantages to that but I would worry that my child would go exploring too much -- 
L:  Well, I'm -- I'm sure they -- 
R:  -- on the internet and -- 
L:  -- probably have, um -- 
R:  Some type of controls.  But, I know they've had the -- the first year anyway that they had 'em -- it was a couple of years' ago.  I remember hearing it on the news that they -- they had to recall them.  All -- all the students had to bring them back in for a different -- you know, so they could install different software -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to keep them from -- 
L:  Huh. 
R:  -- going here, there and everywhere.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, I guess if they could -- if there are ways to -- to keep -- 
L:  Yeah, the -- 
R:  -- track on that then it wouldn't -- then that would be a really good thing just because -- 
L:  Yeah.  There's something called Net Nanny and, ah -- 
R:  I don't think I've ever heard of that.
L:  I mean, it -- it keeps -- it -- it's really good.  I mean, you can't get around it, you can't hack through it.
R:  Oh, that's good -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they could keep, you know -- so -- so, if I had a teenage child and I knew that would -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they were going to use it only for their school work, I think it'd be great.
L:  Right.  Me too.  I think, um, [MN] I don't know, I think everything's growing and just to have the computers you -- you're growing with the economy and everything that's -- 
R:  Sure.
L:  -- growing.
R:  And the way everything is done in business and in healthcare and all those potential careers -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- out there is -- you know, computers are somehow integrated, you know, from a little bit to a lot but I don't know if there's hardly a place of employment where you don't have to -- got a computer at some point.
L:  Oh, no.  I remember -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- when I first started working.  Um, I didn't have a computer on my desk -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I worked at an architect firm and I just sat there [LAUGH] like a little receptionist, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I smoked at my desk and [LAUGH] everything.  It was strange how things change.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, you know, I'm sure, you know, they have a computer and they log people in when they come in, you know?
R:  Sure.
L:  They're used everywhere.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, they're -- I mean, I guess it's mostly helpful to the kids it's because when they -- once they're grown up and have to make their choices then they're -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can integrate wherever they feel like they need to as far as whatever career they choose and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] and other -- and different jobs where they would bring in new computers and they had to teach everybody how to use it, it was kind of -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it'd kind of put a stop to all the work for a while.  Everybody just learned how to use the programs and then there's a lot of catching up to do.  So -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That would be good.  I guess another area where it might be harmful would, um, not that it's even important but it makes you wonder how many -- how much chil- -- kids actually write things out anymore.  Like, maybe maths, but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, I remember when I was in school, I mean, every report that I did was hand written and I imagine that most of the teachers get their reports in -- in their computer.  That are -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that are printed out. 
L:  Yeah.  I mean -- 
R:  Make it easy to read but --  
L:  Gosh.
R:  -- I guess that's not a bad thing at all.  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Except the -- 
L:  I don't know.  I -- 
R:  You're needing to know how to write I guess, I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But -- 
L:  I know for a while -- 
R:  -- it just seems strange to me.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that is strange.  I guess they don't forget how to write but [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, I suppose not.
L:  They could probably go days without writing 'cause in school they probably use the computer only.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, hm.  I'm going to look into that and see if they even have to [LAUGH] write at all.  [LAUGH] They're probably -- 
R:  I can't -- 
L:  -- not teaching the first graders how to manuscript or anything.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  I know that -- I don't think -- I think that once upon a time in the education system handwriting was extremely important but I don't -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- know if they're -- I don't know how much they focus on that anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- 
L:  Typing now.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm, it's true.
L:  Well -- 
R:  They probably learned that -- 
L:  -- I never thought about that.
R:  They probably learned how to do the computer keyboard right along with learning how to write their letters, I imagine.  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah.
R:  I have, um -- like, my oldest are entering kindergarten this year.  I have twins and -- 
L:  Whoa.
R:  -- so this will be my first experience.  I know they have, um -- I know they have some computers in their classroom, in their -- 
L:  In kindergarten?
R:  -- kindergarten classroom.  So -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  And that -- I think that she said there's, like, seven in each classroom.  So, I'll -- I'll be interested to find out what -- what they do.  What they use the computers for, for five year olds.
L:  Right.  Well -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- yeah, my two year old has a -- a few programs.  Of course, with my husband working with computers, he's always messing with the computer and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, [MN] he -- he really learns a lot.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He has like a -- oh, what's it called?  Something bear.  Knowledge -- made by some knowledge company.  And he learns the colors and you just have to press one key on the keyboard to make it go.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- 
R:  Something to have him navigate.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I guess -- 
R:  And this makes it kind of fun.  So, that's probably really a big advantage is that, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- with all the different programs they have it's entertaining for the kids and keeps their attention longer maybe than -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just listening to the teacher do whatever he or she does.
L:  Yeah.  And I think even him [MN] learning things now is going to prepare him for school.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  I know a lot of parents probably are teaching their kids before they get into first grade a little bit about computers, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- 
R:  Well, my kids can -- I can sit them in front if you -- if I -- if I bring them to the, um, [MN] not the PBS, ah, the ses- -- there's a Sesame Street website and, um, they know how to get around that and so -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I -- if I get 'em to that place they know how to, um, click on, like, the different characters to get games that feature those characters and I don't even have to be in the room for them to -- if they -- if they -- if there's a game that they don't understand that they're bored with they know what to click to go to the next game and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, they -- every once in a while they'll have -- they'll have to call for me to explain a certain game to them but -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they can -- you know, they've done enough that they know their way around that -- 
L:  That's amazing.
R:  -- that site.
L:  It is.  Wow.
R:  So, they learn quickly.
L:  [SIGH] Um, [LAUGH] how many of these have you done?
R:  This is the first one.  Like -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I -- I tried to [several inaudible words] that one call and when I introduced myself, um, he -- he had a totally different topic than what I had heard.
L:  Wow.
R:  I don't know how that happened and then -- 
L:  [LAUGH] I don't either.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then I dialed again and was waiting for their, um, for them to find another participant but then I got, um, a call waiting and I clicked out 'cause I was -- my kids were certain to bug me anyway.  So -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, yeah.
R:  -- I wasn't going to be able to talk so I didn't -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I didn't wait until somebody answered.  So, this is the first one.
L:  Oh.
R:  So -- 
L:  Oh, this is my second one.  We don't get paid for them do we?
R:  Well, if you finish three you're supposed to get a check for thirty dollars.
L:  Oh, my gosh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- in some [inaudible] account if you have one of those yet.  But -- 
L:  Wow.  Yeah.
R:  That's [several inaudible words] --
