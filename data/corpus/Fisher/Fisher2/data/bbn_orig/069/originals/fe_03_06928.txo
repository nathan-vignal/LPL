L:  Hi, this is Willie.
R:  Hi, this is Phyllis Codo[?] I'm from Los Angeles, California.  How are you doing this evening?
L:  Fine.  I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.
R:  Oh, that's nice [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, what's our subject for this evening?
L:  Do ah we consider any other country to be a threat --
R:  Pardon me?
L:  -- to the U- -- if we consider any other country to be a threat to -- to the US.
R:  Oh, oh.  Well, beside the Middle East?
L:  Ah, I'm thinking that she's refer to specific countries in the Middle East.
R:  Oh, a specific country in the Middle East?
L:  Yeah.  Specific countries --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in the Middle East.  So, not just Iraq, but Iran --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- or --
R:  I think Iran would --
L:  -- or whatever.  Or wh- not just the Middle East.  Just countries period.
R:  Oh, country.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I think that Iran is -- would be a threat and ah probab- um concerned about North Korea and China.
L:  Mhm.  What do you think about ah I think was -- was it -- it was one of the other countries that bordered Iraq that was possibly letting some of the Iraqians who were in the ah --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- Al Qaeda -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as well as Saddam's regime --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- into their country --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and supposedly ah a truck that was in -- this was like last [inaudible] --
R:  Although I think there was Sa- wasn't that Saudi Arabia?
L:  I can't remember if it was Saudi Arabia or Syria.  I can't remember.  It certainly started with an S though.
R:  Maybe it was Syria.  Maybe it was Syria.  That sounds familiar.
L:  Right.  And so I was --
R:  Oh, I know what it was.  No, was it Turkey?  No, it wasn't Turkey.
L:  Well, you --
R:  Can I ask my husband --
L:  But you know what?
R:  -- for one second?
L:  Sure.
R:  He's right here.
L:  Sure.
R:  Ah, w- what country was ah hiding ah some of ah Hussein's people in the war? [NOISE] Oh, it was Syria.
L:  Oh, it was Syria.
R:  S- --
L:  Oh, you're right on [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he needs to be one of all this c- this call [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm thinking maybe Syria and then you were Turkey --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- if I remember cor- correctly, Turkey didn't want the US to use it's airspace --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- though in the -- though in the beginning of the war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and eventually conceded to letting the US do something, use some part of their country --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- for some purpose.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I just wondered, you know, why not if they were --
R:  Well, you know, all those countries been -- been ruled by like one person for so long and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they haven't really had it -- all those countries haven't had too much of a chance at democracy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they always had these things hanging over their heads, threats of all different kinds and ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and um --
L:  And t- I'm not so sure that ah I know the war is officially over, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm just not so sure if Iraq is still not a threat --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- because --
R:  Ah, oh yeah.
L:  -- Saddam is not captured.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And nor is the -- what was his other -- the other guy's name?  Ah ... 
R:  Well, um, oh --
L:  The guy from Afghanistan.
R:  Oh, I know.  Bin Laden.
L:  Yeah, Bin Laden.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Bin Laden and his boys, they hadn't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- been captured.
R:  [MN] You know, in countries like um Palestine and Israel --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all those countries, I -- I -- I think the UN should have peacekeeping units there till they're, you know, really settled there for live five years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- till -- till they're really on their feet, you know, just to go in and out like that, I mean, they could, you know, go back to their old ways an- anytime soon, you never know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that may be part of ah -- of what some of the people who just don't want -- who -- who think that the US -- I'm talking about Iraqis specifically -- who think that US --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- have -- have come in, they've done their job and now they need to get about -- Iraqis themselves -- need to get about determining what type of government they want as opposed to the democracy that -- that US may feel that they need.
R:  Well, I -- I hope they'll get a democracy, because ah it's been such a long time.  Somebody really needs to teach them about, you know, democracy and all that.
L:  Mhm.  But do you --
R:  At least, I think they -- what they had was sort of like -- like half and half, you know.  Well, he -- Saddam Hussein was in power for like maybe twenty or thirty years, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I don't know how it was before that.  But um [LIPSMACK] I know Jordan is supposed to be the best country there.
L:  Mm.  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What about that country that -- because I watch a lot of US Today -- well, Today --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with Matt Lawrence[?] that's where he was stationed during the w- war, but I can't think of the name of the country.
R:  Wasn't it --
L:  A Ku- -- 
R:  It wasn't ah --
L:  -- it started with a Q, I think.
R:  Oh, Kuwait?
L:  Uh uh.  No, no, no, on.
R:  Oh.
L:  Uh uh.  But it right there on --
R:  Oh, Q -- I though you said K.
L:  Uh uh.
R:  I don't know of any Q.
L:  And it's -- because I had heard about the country once before on Sixty Minutes.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's a really rich country in -- I think it was oil and something else.  Like most of the people have ah merc- drive mercedes and BMWs.
R:  That -- that is Kuwait.  That's Kuwait.
L:  No, nhn, it's another one.  Ask your husband.  I'm serious.
R:  Isn't Kuwait one of the richest countries in oil also in ah the Middle East, Robert? [NOISE] He says yeah.
L:  Yeah, but there's another country.
R:  What -- what's the second richest one there? [NOISE] Saudi Arabia.
L:  But there's another country --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that Matt Lawrence was stationed at --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- doing his reporting.  I can't --
R:  Wasn't Egypt, was it?
L:  No, nhn.
R:  No.
L:  It had an odd name.
R:  [NOISE] Odd name.  What?  What? [NOISE] Qatar.  Is that it? [NOISE]
L:  It sounds nothing like it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, that's what she said.  She says it begins with a Q.  [NOISE] Qatar, Qatar.
L:  Something like that.
R:  Oh, I never even heard of it [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know, it's a little small country.
R:  [NOISE] Qatar.  Yeah, I think it's Qatar.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's what it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I -- I think I remember him saying that everything was free, like education and health services and --
R:  Mm.  That's nice --
L:  -- and all of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  It s- --
L:  Yeah, but I think you're right that also ah North Korea.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I 'cause I think that -- that the US was so busy with Iraq they may not have get -- been able to give the attention to North Korea that ah North Korea deserved --
R:  You've got to really worry about Muslims all over the world and terrorists and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not actually the country itself, but, you know, a lot of people are basically decent people, it's just those terrorists that get into places and stuff, you know --
L:  Mhm.  And then, somebody like ah Hitler --
R:  Oh, God.
L:  -- just one person --
R:  I know.
L:  -- had all those people under his control --
R:  That's scary.  That's scary.
L:  -- and you know years later it's -- it's amazing to --
R:  And these were intelligent -- intelligent people that followed him.
L:  Right.  Why?
R:  Yeah, it's scary.
L:  Yeah, that's just so amazing to me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That he would have such a huge following back then.
R:  Mm.  Maybe the economy wasn't really that stable at the time so people got scared and so maybe that's why they followed him, you know?
L:  Maybe so.
R:  Because this was um, you know, they had World War One and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- World War Two was coming around the bend, so I guess they got freaked out, they got scared, so they thought they would just follow somebody they know, but they followed the wrong way, the wrong ideas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The wrong everything.
L:  Mhm.  And you know what, maybe some of the African countries, too, like --
R:  Yeah, I was just thinking of that too, yeah, you're right.
L:  -- Somalia, I believe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- has a high following of Al Qaeda members --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, when I say high following, I can't quote a figure, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- more than some other countries might have.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  You hear about -- about a lot of ah bombings in A- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- countries in Africa.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even I think US Embassies in --
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Even US Embassies, I think, in --
R:  Yes, yes, uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  -- in ah African --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- countries.
R:  I still can't fathom in the year two thousand and three why people even do this.
L:  I don't understand that either.  And I'm specifically mystified by people who will sc- strap a bomb to their midsection, I guess.
R:  Oh, that is -- that is --
L:  -- and go into a -- a night club or a crowded area and then there'll be --
R:  They must feel strongly about something, but I don't know what it is.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, enough to -- to kill other people and themselves, it's so weird.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Very weird.
L:  And then at times the people that they live -- leave behind, their family members, they seem them as some type of ah martyr or something.
R:  Well, you know, like -- you know, like they were saying like Iraq you know it was uncovered how they were tortured and this and that --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- [inaudible] so I -- I think, you know, young people see this or heard it from their grandparents or whatever and it -- and that stays in their mind, so they get very passionate about, you know, what's -- what's happening and all that, so -- and they really feel for the times, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so maybe that's why they do it, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well the Jewish people in Israel have been through hell there and consecration[?] times and they would never do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm hearing on the news that they're start t- -- starting to talk about really a possible more peace in the Middle East and I'm hoping something starts finally soon.
L:  [MN] Right and I didn't hear the story ah yesterday, but I heard that Bush and --
R:  It tu- -- oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  -- Bush and the President of France were --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- supposedly through with their war of words --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that they were going to get -- try to work towards a more peaceful solution to ah --
R:  I guess you have to be friends with, you know, France but I'm mad that they didn't help us, I'm very mad at them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They hate us, I don't even know why they hate us so much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's what I'm hearing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  We sa- we saved their country in World War Two, you know?
L:  Maybe it's, "Oh, how quickly we forget".
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Maybe, so.
R:  Yeah.  Hm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, I think, you know, when these [LIPSMACK] ah
