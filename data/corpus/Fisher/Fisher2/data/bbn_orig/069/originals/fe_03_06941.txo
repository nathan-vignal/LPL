R:  Hello.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Sarah.  How are you?
L:  Uh, I'm just fine.  My name is Joanna.
R:  Joanna. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Where -- where are you calling from?
R:  Um, Los Angeles.
L:  Oh --
R:  Well, Santa Monica, actually.
L:  Oh, right.  Okay, I'm -- I'm in Canada, on Vancouver Island so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, we're on the same coast, at least.
L:  Ri- -- right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and, uh, I've never called -- done this call before. [LAUGH]
R:  Me, neither.  This is my first one, too.  I tried it earlier and, um, [SIGH] for some reason the computer system wasn't working so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I just kinda gave it up and then I just was sorting through my phone numbers right now and I thought, "What am I doing with this number?" and I remembered.  I was like, "Okay, well let me call it now --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I'll try". [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about education in --
L:  [MN] Yes, and how com- --
R:  -- with -- as [MN] --
L:  How computers, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Are they -- I guess, are they a help or a hindrance to education.  What are our thoughts about that, I guess.
R:  Um, I would say -- I don't know, um, I would say definitely a help, um, to an extent unless they're used to replace an actual interactive teacher [LAUGH] so --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- um --
L:  Well, I -- I have a kindergarten student --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and, um, I know that for -- even for him, I mean, he's not [LAUGH] really into the education really well but -- but, um, we look up lots of things on the internet and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  And for -- you know, from our point of view, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's quite helpful, like if he has a question about something and we don't have a vast amount of books in our home and --
R:  Right.
L:  And so it's sort of like an extension of a library.
R:  Right, no, it's like a huge ex- -- encyclopedia.  You -- I can even just write in any kind of keywords --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that just randomly are close to what I'm talking about and actually what is really cool about it is when you are looking for one thing, you end up finding ten other things you didn't even know you were looking for.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I just -- I end up getting stuck on there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and reading so much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it definitely is the super -- super highway --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of information. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, I -- I find it -- I find it quite helpful that way and even -- even our local library's online so it's also to -- for us, it's -- it's, you know, way easier just to, uh -- to look up books if you wanted to do research that way as well.  Just to find them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Find them online and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, and then request them.
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  Oh, I mean, it's the library system but --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So --
R:  Right.  And then, also as parents, I'm a -- I have a two and a half year old but, um, when I was first, you know -- this is my first child, when I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was [LAUGH] first just having questions in my head that you wouldn't really necessarily even be able to find a book on the subject --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it was really interesting to be able to learn because of the -- the ab- -- ability to interact with other people on the [SIGH] internet.  So I think, yeah, all in all, definitely but I think what they may be referring to in their question is probably, like, do they mean, um, more in college kind of when --
L:  Oh, right, yeah.
R:  -- they're doing courses over the internet or -- or kind of replacing actual instructors by --
L:  Oh, right. [LAUGH]
R:  With computers.  Do they mean like that, do you think --
L:  Well, I -- I'm not really sure.
R:  -- in their --
L:  I -- I --
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I mean, that's definitely another aspect of it all right.  I -- I hadn't really thought about that but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, I -- I guess -- I guess they are but, I mean, even -- I guess, even for that it probably has some application where -- you know, for -- for online learning, I guess, for --
R:  Right.
L:  As opposed to -- opposed to going to class, um --
R:  Well, how do you think they mean it could hinder it then 'cause there's obviously people out there with the opinion that it does if that's the debate? [LAUGH] So --
L:  Well -- well, the one thing that I -- that I think of is that -- that, um, you can't really take everything on the internet as being --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you -- you know, ex- -- you know, one hundred percent truthful.  I mean, some --
R:  [MN]
L:  Some of it certainly is accurate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, um -- but, you know, do --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, you might have to question the source a little bit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sometimes, so --
R:  Right.
L:  So, and --
R:  Which in everything you do, though.  I -- I was taught by my family, when I brought my schoolbooks home, especially given American history is -- is pretty slanted and, you know, we have -- we're part native American and, you know, things like that, so when, um, we brought our books home, my dad always said, "Well, question, you know --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- where the source of the information is coming from.  Of course, read it and get what you can" but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's actually a really good concept to teach everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, just on --
L:  Oh, oh --
R:  On anything, even books.
L:  Yeah, oh, for sure.
R:  But I do know what you mean on the internet, you know.  There's just some crazy stuff [LAUGH] out there.
L:  Well, well, yeah, I -- there's -- and -- and, I mean, there's a -- a -- a vast source of information and -- and way beyond what you could probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- find in any of your local libraries but -- but how accurate is it and --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  And -- and, I mean, are we pinning a whole premise on something [LAUGH] that's -- you know, that's, you know, could be a lie or --
R:  Yeah, just completely.
L:  Or -- or -- or -- or somebody's just opinion and there's no fact --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to back it up.
R:  Right, yeah, so at least when you're writing a book, I think to get it published and distributed you have to have some credibility. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And -- and I guess the other aspect of it, too, does that make -- does it make kids lazy?
R:  Right --
L:  What -- what --
R:  -- that was the first thing --
L:  Yeah, does it --
R:  -- that came to mind is when kids just end up being on the computer all the time, too, and just zoning out.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and even -- even for, um, doing, say, a book report, is -- is it, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  Are -- are -- do they just go to the internet and find --
R:  And find --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- somebody else's --
L:  -- three or four --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, either find somebody else's report or -- or just --
R:  Right.
L:  Or just find three or four sources and -- and then use that rather than --
R:  Right.
L:  Than using a more diverse, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of information, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I bet that's probably true, too. [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  And -- and --
R:  Yeah, and I know -- I know my mom as a child -- she's a child psy- -- psychologist and she does say that, um, [LIPSMACK] with young kids it's really important to just have human interaction, one on one.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, so, um -- so I know that -- that ki- -- for younger kids, it's all -- it's also a hindrance, just because it -- it's interactive when you get old enough to be in chatrooms and things like that or I -- I never use actual chatrooms but -- but message boards or things that are on a particular subject.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but as a kid I think it does -- does take away from the time they would be getting human interaction and that kind of -- I know TV and computers are definitely not recommended for --
L:  Yeah, for --
R:  -- pre schoolers, really.
L:  For -- yeah, for really young -- young kids, yeah.
R:  So that could be another aspect of it being a hindrance.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But things like I -- I do silk screening and, um, you know, things like a craft or something that's a little bit more specific that I -- I did have a really hard time finding information about it on the -- in the library.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's one of these things that's, uh, you know, always changing and, um, there's new products out all the time that help and so the silk screeners or the screen printing message board was, like, amazingly helpful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I'll be working on something and go, "Why does it always puff more on one side than the other side?" when I'm using puffing or a special technique [LAUGH] and I can go online --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's -- there's ton of voice of experience, you know, so --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  [MN] So that's one way that I just think it's really great.
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I don't know --
R:  So ...
L:  -- I mean, I guess it all depends, too, on -- on, I don't know, the -- the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The future of it, where -- where they're -- where they're planning on going with -- with computers in classrooms and that but --
R:  Right.
L:  But there's -- you know, there -- there are kids that are, you know, developing -- well, their skills are way beyond [LAUGH] -- my husband used to teach high school and, you know, like if you ever had a question about computer, you asked the high school kids because [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they --
R:  -- 'cause they -- yeah.
L:  They -- they -- you know, they knew more about it than --
R:  They know more about it than we do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Than we do, so -- so does it make them one dimensional, I don't know.  Like, like, um [LIPSMACK] -- but, um, I don't know --
R:  Hm.
L:  I'm -- I'm not sure.  And then, of course, they -- they also had, um, troubles at -- at their school, too, with -- they had to block certain sites and that --
R:  Oh, right, yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  See, that's the problem, I know, and that really is irritating.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have, uh -- my nephew will come during the summers and -- and, uh, my husband's fourteen year -- well, he's sixteen now, year old son, they'd be on the computer, three in the morning and I'd be like, "What are you looking at?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, [LAUGH] yes.
R:  But they're both brilliant kids but I have to say one thing that, um -- I mean, they're -- um, er, Ev- -- Everett's sixteen, he's going to be graduating from high school and Ronnie's fifteen and he'll graduate next year.  They're really smart kids, they read a lot but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know that the computer kept them from getting outside [LAUGH] a lot.
L:  Yes, yes.
R:  So I don't know how much of that make -- you know, like you said, the -- the -- does kinda hinder their [SIGH] multi dimensional learning, you know.
L:  Yeah, oh, for sure.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I would love for them to get out and get some actual physical experience.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  They tend to be, you know, on the computer in the chatrooms and not even, you know, out.  I'm like, "Don't you want to go out and meet some girls or something?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What was I doing at fifteen, sixteen?  I was out trying to, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have fun and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- go to the movies with friends or something [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're like, "No, no, we're fine just right here", they go on the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  The, um, boards where you create stories with the other people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, it's fantasy world or whatever but they --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They all, like, type in their -- you know, like -- it's like spill the beans or something, you pass the story along from [LAUGH] one person to the next --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and everybody kinda creates a story --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which is great but, again, last summer they were inside.  We live right on the beach, [LAUGH] I mean literally you walk outside and your feet are on the sand and they were in here on a computer [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, and -- and you do wonder, sort of, like what did we do before [LAUGH] -- before we had computers.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Like you said, yeah, 'cause even the -- the trip to the library or the --
