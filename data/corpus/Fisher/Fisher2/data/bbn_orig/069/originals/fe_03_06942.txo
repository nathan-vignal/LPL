L:  Hello.  I'm Jennifer.
R:  Hi, I'm Chantay.
L:  Hi.
R:  Uh, I'm in DC.  Where are you?
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  So, computers in education.  How do you feel about them?
R:  Um, it's improved the education, especially for DC students.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, why especially for DC students?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because not too many, um, students --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have access to computers in their home so when they go to school that's where they get a chance of being more knowledgeable being on a computer. [NOISE]
L:  That's true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think that they, uh, improve learning also [COUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially since computers are such, um, an integral part of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- our society today.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, hm, and I imagine it's better to have computers at school, too, 'cause I know a lot of people can't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have one in their homes or don't have one --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in their homes yet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, hm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I've -- I don't know how it would harm education.  That doesn't really make any sense.
R:  Oh, they probably talking about the internet.
L:  Oh, the internet?
R:  Mhm.  That's what I think they talking about, I'm not sure.
L:  Yeah, the question was kind of weird.  Um, usually they ask you, like, three questions and you get to talk about them. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, yeah, I guess the internet is a learning tool as well [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I don't see why that would take away from education at all.
R:  Mhm.  The internet is a whole lot of help, you can learn a whole lot of stuff off the internet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, 'cause [COUGH] [NOISE] if they're in school they're not going to be, like, looking at, like, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like games or stuff they're not supposed to be looking at or whatever so yeah, I think computers in school's fine.
R:  Mhm, 'cause my little brother, he have access to computer anyway 'cause he got a computer at home so he does his -- his homework on the computer as a matter fact [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm, and he only eight years old.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I definitely could not use a computer when I was eight years old.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] We didn't have 'em then.  Um, um, yeah, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're just -- you -- every -- you have to know how to use computers these days and --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you need 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, to do just about everything.
L:  It's true.
R:  And it's more faster and convenient.
L:  It's true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hm.
R:  My daughter, she's one and she like the computer already.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, my gosh. [MN]
R:  But she just turn one today as a matter of fact and she loves the computer.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Does she just, like, play games on the computer or just like fool --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- around with it or ...?
R:  She just like to fool around with it.  She like to mess with the keyboard and the mouse mostly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's awesome she has early exposure to the computer.  You never know, she might be a computer, uh, genius or something --
R:  [LAUGH] She might.
L: -- when she gets older. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh, but she love the computer. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, it's awesome.  Um, [COUGH] hm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is that your -- is that your -- do you have other children?
R:  Uh-huh, I have five altogether.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  Oh, there you go.  Wow, that's amazing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] Oh, that's good stuff.  Is she your youngest?  Do they all -- do they all go on the computer?
R:  Um, my son he also loves the computer [NOISE] and he's -- he'll be two next week.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh --
R:  My daughter she don't care too much for the computer, she like to go outside and play with her friends.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Huh.
R:  So she's not into it as much as they are.
L:  Mm.  Yeah, I don't know [COUGH] -- I don't know if I -- yeah, I probably like to go outside better [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  -- than play on the computer but I don't have like -- I have to, like, go to the library or whatever to use one anyway so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, it's not -- I don't have one in the house so it's not as easy.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um, I don't know, um [COUGH] -- so, you go on the computer, too, then?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I stay on the computer also.  That's probably where they get it from, me.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's a good thing to have.
R:  Some of my stepbrother, they stay on the internet in the summer and I pass them along information.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH]
R:  They love the internet.
L:  Yeah, I like the internet, it's good, it's a good thing.  You can find out pretty much about anything on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's good, knowledge is good.  Um, [COUGH] what else?  I wish they would have asked us another question.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All the other calls that I've had, they've been like three questions.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, is this your first call?
R:  Um, this is my third call.
L:  Yeah, this is my third call, too.
R:  And when the lady called, I wasn't even -- you know when the machine calls you?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I wasn't even in, I was like, "Who called and left me a message?" [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, they always call whenever I can't do it so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- just have to call back but [COUGH] I don't know, um, computers are awesome, what else? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] They're helpful [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] [COUGH] All the schools have computers now, right?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, they should.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Know when I was going to school they -- they didn't have the internet there.
L:  Yeah, whenever I was in school, like, we had computers, I remember I was, like, in sixth grade but I didn't have exposure to the internet until I was like in twelfth grade.
R:  Mm, okay.
L:  So ... but now they have, like, internet classes and stuff.
R:  Oh, well, I didn't know that.
L:  I don't know why you need a class on the internet but --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] -- um, classes about the internet might be harming education 'cause it's easy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's pretty self explanatory but other than that, um, computers in school are good.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hm.
R:  Mm.
L:  Hm.
R:  They got some -- um, in DC, some apartment complexes have like a learning center that has internet also.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That --
R:  So that's very helpful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to students.
L:  That's a good idea.
R:  More apartment complexes should have that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's a very good facility.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  Keeps them off the street and do something good.
L:  Yeah.
