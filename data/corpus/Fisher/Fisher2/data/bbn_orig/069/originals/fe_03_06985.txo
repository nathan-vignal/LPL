R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello.  Hi.
R:  Hey.  Ah my name is Pretty.
L:  Brittany?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Brittany with a B?
R:  No.  P.
L:  Oh.  Prittany.
R:  As the word in English, Pretty.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH].
R:  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?  My name is [inaudible]?
R:  What?
L:  My name is Robert.
R:  Robert.  Okay.  Nice to talk to you.
L:  Yeah.  It's hard to understand.  I'm using a cellphone.  I don't know.
R:  Even I'm using the cellphone [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah?  Yeah.  See I m- -- it's just our phone connections, I guess.  Kinda crappy.
R:  Yeah.  So, ah have you done this before?
L:  No, I haven't.  This is the first time I --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- just signed up for --
R:  I know --
L:  -- and um --
R:  -- and me too.  This is my first and she just said, you know, the topic is education and ah so, where do we start?
L:  Um, I'm not sure.  Y- -- well, I mean, are we just supposed to talk about what -- how we think computers influence education?
R:  Yes, I suppose so.  That's what she said.
L:  Okay.  Well, um, I guess I could start first.
R:  Okay.  Go ahead.
L:  [inaudible] Ah, I think computers in education is a good thing because um they e- -- every -- every type of information you need is more easily accessible --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and um you know, plus the benefits of what a computer could provide, like a calculator or just for ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- databases, records or whatever, anything you're going to look up, like let's say the whole library was connected, you know, and um instead of just looking into a set of encyclopedias and not knowing how to find it, a computer would probably be a lot easier to provide help.
R:  Yes.  That's true. 
L:  So, I think computers in -- in schools would be, you know, computers in education itself is pretty much required now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ah just -- it just depends on how it's integrated.  You know, I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm sure there'd be a lot of things that wouldn't be appropriate for school in --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in computers, but --
R:  Yes.  And --
L:  -- you know ah --
R:  -- and it's ah --
L:  -- it just seems like there's a lot --
R:  -- and it's so much easier to teach um younger kids about the computers than people who have grown older and so it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's always good to start early and in school and so the kids when they you know because now everything is computerized wherever they go, whatever, you know, wherever you go like from the grocery store to every other place you can imagine there's, you know, just -- just everywhere there are computers, so I think it's -- it's a very good thing that they're um ah as far as computers in education is concerned that they start in school and they start early and -- and you know they're -- they have that upper hand.
L:  I -- I agree.  I definitely agree.  Because ah --
R:  So --
L:  -- yeah, the computer is ah -- has now become a part of society.  No matter what we're doing, whether -- whether it's ah at home or fun or ah work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- computers are almost definitely involved.
R:  Yes.  That's so true.  And they're in expendable because I mean you -- you realy can't do anything, you can't imagine anything now without computers because um I mean even at home you -- if you want to look up something you, you know, the first thing that crosses your mind is the Internet and ah anything and it might be just a simple recipe or um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or maybe a word um or the spelling of a word or, you know, it's -- it's so easy to look it up ah in -- in the computer versus say go to the library, look for a book and then you know go through it.  So, I- -- you know, life has become so much more easier because of the computers and -- and obviously education ah becomes more interesting and I guess ah m- -- kids who may not otherwise have gone through school may go through because of the interest in computers and you know maybe interest in studying just that one subject.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I think it's -- it's really, really important ah that ah that computers be there in education and um -- um yeah, that's about it.
L:  Right.  That pretty much covers the topic.  Um, I mean, to go one step further, look at how we're having this conversation.  The cellphones that we're using they're, you know, more electronic than they are computer, but they still have the same function.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And -- and the technology that goes into ah this communication is all computerized.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  So, that's why I think computers are definitely required um in today's socie- -- in today's daily -- daily function of putting, you know, putting ah education into our generations.
R:  Yes.  That's so true.  And um -- so, what did y- --
L:  So y- -- go ahead.
R:  What did she say that we're supposed to do after ten minutes?  I didn't catch that.
L:  Yeah, I didn't catch I -- it was just a recording, you know, they're so hard to understand it over the phone.
R:  Yeah.  I was actually at a store checking out, so I couldn't really follow what she said.
L:  Right.  I couldn't follow it too much myself.  I -- I'm sitting here like, okay, I guess [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] So, how would we know ah that the ten -- I mean, you know, that we're supposed to stop?
L:  When it's ten minutes, I guess.  So, I guess it hasn't been ten minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  That's what I would assume.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I --
L:  But you know what they say about people who assume.
R:  Or what?
L:  Oh, nothing.  Just ah, you never heard the saying about assuming?
R:  About assuming?
L:  About people assuming ah -- b- -- assuming something.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You never heard the saying about that?
R:  No.  What is it?
L:  Ah, they're like opinions, everybody has one.  Well, it's -- said it differently but it --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Never mind.  I -- I -- it slipped by ya.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I thought you might have heard it before.
R:  No, I haven't.  [LIPSMACK] So, what else can we talk about.  Computers.  Um ...
L:  Yeah, how'd you sign up for this?
R:  Oh, well, ah -- I'm part of an e group ah that has um you know, they tell about peop- -- like this kind of stuff, surveys and stuff like that so um one of the persons in our group posted about this and so I went to the ah website and signed up for it --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and like this is my first call.  I signed up like almost ah two weeks back.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Wow.
R:  And this is my first call.  So --
L:  I -- wow, my -- my experience is quite different.  I ah -- I just put in a search --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for ah -- um, not -- not quite surveys, but in more general um things that were being offered over the Internet and ah --
R:  Uh-huh.  What did you put?
L:  What did I type?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know a- -- exactly what I typed.  I just remember searching for stuff on Google and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a few, you know, probably about ten pages in I found this --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- out of a -- out of this, you know so many pages that showed up.  Then um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then as soon as I signed up, they called me today and I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- well, I signed up yesterday.
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I think the problem might have been that I signed up two numbers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the -- the other -- my land phone might have been engaged or something --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah when you know the computer might have tried to call me and it might have gotten my other line engaged.  So, I guess ah that's why they wi- -- might have waited and then they might have tried my cellphone because I had given my cellphone number as a -- as the other number.
L:  Right [MN].
R:  It may be something like that, I don't know.  You know, or may be they would have called and I might not have been home or something like that because I had given them um a time ah in the afternoon.  So, maybe something like that might have happened.
L:  They -- they said -- they should have us like ah connected on some kind of money hunters line or something because I mean I think just talking with one other person doesn't really discuss a topic a lot.  You know what I mean?  I mean I'm sure there's somebody that would say, well would come up with reasons why not to have computers in education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And talking with just one other person doesn't really bring up everybody else's view.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know what I mean?  I -- I --
R:  And -- and -- and how long can you talk about ah something like this?  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you couldn't --
L:  We -- we finished, you know, after like four minutes of talking [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].  That's so true.  I mean, it's not something that you can go on and on and on.  I mean I -- there are so many other topics that you can, you know, talk like forever but ah --
L:  Right.
R:  I mean something like that --
L:  It's kind of a --
R:  -- is like so um you know there isn't much you can talk about except of course you can talk if you -- if you go into the details, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah the technical details, you know, but ah I don't think
