R:  Hi.
L:  Hello.
R:  I'm Candace.  How are you?
L:  Hi, I'm fine.  I'm Alice.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You, too.  So is this -- this is my first time.  Is there just two people then talking?
R:  Yes, just the two of us.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh gosh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] Ah, have you done -- you've done this before then or ...?
R:  Yeah, just twice though.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ...
L:  And you can only do it three times?
R:  Yep.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yep.
L:  Okay.  So what are we supposed to talk about?
R:  Computers in education.
L:  Computers in education?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, so --
R:  Do you have any thoughts on computers in education?
L:  [MN] Well, um, [LAUGH] I guess they're probably pretty necessary in our day and age, you know.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- I'm beginning to think you can't do anything without them so --
L:  Yeah, I mean there's not a lot of choice, um, so -- I work -- I work in the school district so, um, it's a constant battle to keep them current and updated, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and moneywise, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Do --
L:  So --
R:  Do they have 'em in most classrooms now or is it -- 'cause I -- in my high school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we had just en- -- we had classrooms with them but not enough for every classroom?
L:  Right.  Yeah, huh, you know but I'm not actually in the classroom myself so I'm not positive.
R:  Okay.
L:  Well, my kids have just all graduated and they -- yeah, not in every classroom --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not in their case and it was pretty standard.  You know, they have them in the computer classes then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I think, like, in elementary schools they maybe have like one or two in each classroom --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- or something like that.
R:  My sister's a teacher and since they don't have enough for all the students they're actually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just getting laptops for all the teachers and they teach --
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, and then they teach them how to do the stuff on, like, the overhead projector which I think is --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know if it's the best one to learn but at least --
L:  No.
R:  -- I think it's some exposure to it, I think.
L:  Okay, so they're seeing the layout attempt[?], um
R:  Mhm.
L:  Huh.
R:  So she uses it for, like, um -- she teaches, like, AP history classes --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- so she does all kind of computer games and stuff like that with history and that way --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they can all play, that way --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and all their papers --
L:  Well, that makes sense.
R:  -- they do on computers but, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I don't know how -- how accessible they are at her school or if they just all have them at home so she's able to do that or what.
L:  Right.  And she's at -- in high school, then?  High -- teaching at the high school level or ...?
R:  Yeah, she teaches eleventh and twelfth grade --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- she said it works out, she said it makes things a lot easier and a lot more efficient but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I know that a lot of the teachers in her school don't even know how to use them.  Like even really basic things.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, so she got hired --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, which I was really surprised by.
L:  Yeah, me too, you'd think --
R:  She said not the younger ones, the older ones so --
L:  Yeah, I guess that would make sense but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you would think in this day and age even the older ones --
R:  I would think so.
L:  I mean, they all -- all the schools have continuing education classes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, so she has a technology certificate --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so she ends up helping out a lot, like train other teachers how to do stuff --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, I don't know if --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just her school district because I've never heard of this before --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't have that much exposure to it so ...
L:  Yeah, it's probably -- probably -- I would think that would be pretty standard, a little of both, some people very +knowledgeable and others not, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  It makes sense.
L:  You know.
R:  I guess it's just like any office. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, well even like with, uh -- I would think in the continuing ed classes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even if you take 'em --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like a one day class or something, you know, how much can you absorb in a day, you know --
R:  Yeah, you --
L:  -- unless you really go back to your office and use it.
R:  Yeah, you really do need the time to mess around with it before it sticks with you and even then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I think you forget unless you use it all the time.
L:  That's for sure, yeah.
R:  There's so many little --
L:  Do you, um --
R:  -- tricks to each program. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Do you -- are you on the computer a lot yourself, uh --
R:  Uh, yeah, I'm in graduate school and I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm an intern right now but, yeah, it's --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All my work's computer based so ...
L:  Right, yeah.  Mine is, too.
R:  How about you?
L:  Yeah, I'm at where I use a lot of spreadsheets and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Though I've not -- mostly it's all been self taught for that but I'm taking a one daily course --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- actually next week to go more advanced on my Excel --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- just so I --
R:  Yeah, there's a lot you need to know.
L:  It's something -- basically my boss -- my boss offered to pay for it so I said, "I'll take it" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, 'cause I know I would --
R:  That's nice when work does it.
L:  What's that?
R:  It's really nice when work offers, like, computer classes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like that.
L:  Yeah, this'll be good and I figure I waste a lot of time trying to figure it all out for myself because I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, especially on Excel if you haven't done it, you know.  I mean, there's a million ways to do things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on that, so --
R:  Yeah, but sometimes you waste so much time +figuring -- figuring --
L:  What's that?
R:  -- out how to do stuff.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking so if I go take this class and, you know, teach me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a few more advanced things. [LAUGH]
R:  It's interesting, though, how many people can teach theirselves.  I have a -- a friend and he designed -- he designed a computer program and he figured --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it all out from a book. [LAUGH]
L:  Really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you just have -- some people are just very good with computers. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not one of them. [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Definitely, yeah.
R:  I need the classes.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, so far I've -- well, I can -- I mean, I can't say I've totally -- I mean, I've taught myself in that I haven't taken classes but I've had people show me things [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, my boss showed me this and that but you get tired of asking someone to show you stuff so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  I'm -- I'm amazed, though, how -- how many people don't know really basic things like I guess things that I -- I probably learned in school and took for granted.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some of the older people in my office, like even with +Excel -- Excel spreadsheets, just making things fit to the page. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, how to spread -- str- -- stretch it --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- open it?  Yeah, yeah, that's the truth, there's -- and even some young people [LAUGH] it's kinda surprising --
R:  That's true, definitely.
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  I guess you just use -- you gotta use it before you learn it so --
L:  Right, oh yeah, my husband's that way.  He's -- you know, whenever he's on a computer it's play solitaire, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]. Uh, spider solitaire's really fun, I don't know if you've ever played that one?
L:  I don't know, I think he has, he --
R:  Very addictive.
L:  He's -- yeah, he's pretty much into these different solitaire type games and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- free cell and all these [LAUGH].
R:  I --
L:  But I -- I say, well at least he's on the computer trying it. [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, yeah.  I don't know if it's good for school but [LAUGH] it's fun.
L:  [LAUGH] That's the truth, yeah, so [LAUGH] -- yeah.
R:  I imagine though to be in a classroom with, like, twenty, thirty kids and to have to teach them how to use computers all at the same time --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- it's got to be a little challenging. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, and that -- [LAUGH] yeah, standing in the classroom and they're all -- yeah -- [LAUGH]
R:  They're all doing different things and playing.
L:  Well, I mean, all -- you know, they'd all be in such different places --
R:  Yeah, it's true.
L:  -- you know, knowledge wise and --
R:  And some kids seem to get it so much faster than others.  I guess it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just depends what, you know -- how much exposure they have at home.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] So ...
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I know, yeah, actually it amazes me how much my kids -- 'cause we didn't -- well, now we have computers at home but when they were a little younger, our computer was so old it was an antique, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But somehow they picked it all up, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Yeah, that's good, it's really good.
L:  Um --
R:  I like how they have all those computer drives where you can save your receipts and stuff and donate to them -- to the high school and stuff like that.  I think it's --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  It's a little bit -- makes it a little bit easier for the high schools like that.
L:  Yeah, yeah, they were -- tech -- yeah, our high school has that.  They have a tech department that re -- the kids rebuild them.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, you know, people go in with their old monitor, ev- -- everything and they just rebuild, what -- what's rebuildable, I guess they do, anyway.
R:  That's pretty neat.  I've never heard of one of those programs, that's pretty good.
L:  Yeah, yeah, it's -- it keeps, I guess, a lot of them out of the landfills and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I guess that's how we get as many as we do have in our classrooms is through that program.
R:  That's a great program. [SIGH] I did --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I never really thought about how expensive --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it must be to keep updating the software and everything.
L:  Oh!  Yeah, it -- it's -- it's just a never ending --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's a constant fundraiser to keep the schools [LAUGH] in --
R:  You'd think the Gates Foundation, for the stuff they donate, would donate more computers to high schools and stuff.
L:  That's true because that's, uh, where their next comp- -- [NOISE] their next, um, customers are, I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] You know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess, though, they figure the high schools will eventually scrape up the money to buy them some new ones. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Undercut their market.
L:  We [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they eventually do, so -- so, is this your third time doing this or second, is that --
R:  Third.
L:  What'd you say?  Third?  So you can't do it anymore?
R:  This is my last one.  Yep. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, no, but you can refer people?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- and have you gotten paid for any of it yet or ...?
R:  No, I just did 'em all in the last two days.
L:  Oh, so they -- they pretty much call you right away, huh?  Because I --
R:  Oh, I called in because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, I missed my times so I just --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- did one a day.
L:  Well, I, um -- I just signed up yesterday but I'm -- I'm actually in the grocery store right now and I'm going I don't know if I tell 'em no if they'll knock me off the list. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, you can get the one off -- actually off of your computer. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's right, yeah, I did see that on the --
R:  They email it to you so ...
L:  Yeah, that's true, I did read it but I just read it really quick.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  It makes it a little easier. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, yeah.  I was picturing it was going to be like a whole group --
R:  Uh, uh --
L:  -- conversation and --
R:  Yeah I thought it would be at first, too, but I like how the topics change every day, too.  It's kinda nice.
L:  Oh, so it's different each day, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's kind weird, I don't know how they do this but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it -- it's interesting the range of topics 'cause today's like the computers in classrooms which is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's kind of a hard -- I think it's a harder topic to talk about, [NOISE] I mean --
L:  Is it?
R:  -- you expect classrooms to have them, you know kids need them, I don't see what the -- what the debate is. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yeah, what are you going to say?  Let's go back to pen and pencil?
R:  Yeah, no --
L:  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  -- it's just not going to happen.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But the other -- yesterday was foreign affairs and the day before that was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Middle Eastern --
L:  Well --
R:  Um, the Middle Eastern conflict, so ...
L:  You know, there was, um -- on one of the -- the little chat things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there was, um, people, you know, back and forth about something to do with the Middle Eastern stuff.  There was some people of different descents that were offended by, I think, what the topics were and they didn't know what their agenda was.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I -- I didn't -- I came in at the tail end of it and I don't know what they were talking about really except for that.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  You know, people -- people of different descents were wondering why --
R:  Oh.
L:  What it was all about, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah but --
L:  But --
R:  -- that's an interesting point though, I guess like the -- that would turn certain people off, depending on what the topics were but I guess you could always hang up and call again.
L: Yeah, that's true, that's true.  Well, and they were -- the people that were chatting, they were leaving these messages, they were -- actually, one of the -- one of the girls I knew but she was Ara- -- a -- Arabic -- Arabic or however you say it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, so I guess --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  I don't know, maybe they thought the whole program was somehow about that.
R:  Oh, interesting.
L:  About that issue but I mean at that point -- 'cause is this is an input room or -- do you know?
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Yeah, me either, this is the first --
R:  This is the first I've ever heard of it, so ...
L:  Yeah, me too.  I just heard of it a couple of days ago actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ooh, I can talk on the phone [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah --
