L:  Hi, I'm Jennifer.
R:  Hi Jennifer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm Rhonda.
L:  Hi Rhonda.
R:  Hi.
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] This is so goofy, it's like --
R:  [LAUGH] I know.
L:  -- it's like a blind date.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, it kind of is, huh?
L:  [LAUGH] you know?
R:  Um, well, let's see, where are you calling from?
L:  Um, Columbus, Ohio.
R:  Okay, I'm in, ah, Texas.
L:  Oh, really?  Wow.
R:  Yeah, Grapevine actually, it's outside of Dallas.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
R:  So, is this your first call on this?
L:  I did it, um, one time last week too.
R:  Okay, yeah, this is my second one too.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's kind of weird --
R:  It is.
L:  -- I mean, it's kind of like, I mean, I don't know, it's fine [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  -- but -- but, yeah, I mean, it's like, you know, these -- it- it's strange talking to somebody that --
R:  About something different.
L:  Right.
R:  And this one's supposed to be on how you feel about computers and education.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have any kids?
L:  Um, actually, yeah, I do.  We have, um -- we have four kids.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sitting -- 
R:  I just have one and --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- she's four --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, as a matter of fact she goes to, um, two days a week she goes up to church for a little school up there from nine to two --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they do offer a computer program up there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's just a little extra thing if you want to sign your kids up for if they have a --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lady who comes in and she does it and, I -- I did put her in that and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- man, I'll tell you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what, it's amazing what she knows because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- she has learned so much.  She can get on -- she'll get on the computer, you know, at the hou- -- at home --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she's all over the place on that thing.  I'll come in there and she's gotten back into the programming, you know --
L:  Oh, wow.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff and I'm like --
L:  Wow.  [NOISE]
R:  -- how did you get in there --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's like, "Oh, like this, mom", just click, click, click, click, click --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm going, "Wow".  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I think she's a pretty much better than I am.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow.  Well, it seems like they're more intuitive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I, [SIGH] well, [LIPSMACK] -- I sort of grew up with computers but, um, it was -- it was dad's and, you know, you weren't supposed to touch it [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- unless he, you know, set something up for you, but -- but still, I think -- I see my mom and she's just -- she has never really even -- and we've had a computer in the home at my parents' place for years and she --
R:  And not really into that?
L:  -- you know, she's always been real timid, she's always afraid she's gonna [NOISE] --
R:  Do something wrong on it.
L:  -- blow something up, you know.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Like, you know, I think a lot of people are when you first get on there.  One of the things I can see would be a definite benefit for kids is, ah, being able to go on line and look things up for homework and that kind of thing.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  If you need to do something on -- or -- or even if your kids have a question, if they come home and they're --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, want to know something about a dinosaur, and you're like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well I don't know, you know, but you can look it up there and it's not like, you know, when your parents used to buy the encyclopedias --
L:  Right, oh, I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and by the next year, you know, they're out of -- and, I mean, it's like every set, every parent, they have a three year old set of, ah, you know, or thirty year old set of encyclopedias that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I hated looking in those things anyway.
L:  Oh, yeah, Comptons[?] encyclopedia --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- let's see, I started school --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in nineteen seventy six and they were already, like, eight or ten years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- old by then.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's like they were so outdated, forget -- and they paid a ton of money for them.
L:  Sure -- sure.
R:  Who has encyclopedias now?  No one.
L:  Oh, I know, I know.
R:  If any body has them it's an -- just an old set they have collecting dust.
L:  Yep.
R:  Nobody buys them any more.
L:  You know, can you imagine, there's probably somebody out there that's still trying to sell them to people.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Door to door.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  'Cause I think that's how my mum bought hers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's like a definite --
L:  The world book salesman.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, but I can definitely see how -- how, you know, things like that would be a benefit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then I can see, and of course I haven't had to deal with this yet, but I can see how going on line with a child, how also, you know, just like in anywhere else, there's people out there that want to prey on your innocent little kids --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and so you have to kind of keep a log of what they're doing and where they're getting to make sure --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they're not getting into anything -- 'cause I know even like I'll check my email and there'll be porn email on there and I'm, like --
L:  Oh, isn't that just horrifying.
R:  -- I didn't go to any porn sites, so --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I don't -- how, you know, how is this stuff getting into my email because, you know --
L:  Your -- your name got sold to somebody, you know.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, but it's, like, I'm not, you know, I am not going into -- it's one thing if that's my thing and I'm going into their sites and they're sending me email, fine --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, you know, when I click my email up, and some of them come up with pictures, you know, my daughter's in there, like --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I don't really want her seeing that, you know, so --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- it's like I try to, when I click on them, I just kind of look through 'em and anything that sounds weird to me I just delete it before I ever --
L:  Yeah, do you have [NOISE] --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- you -- do you have hotmail?  [NOISE]
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  No.
L:  I had hotmail and I eventually just stopped using it because [NOISE] --
R:  You get a bunch of that.
L:  -- I think -- well, when Microsoft bought them all of a sudden I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- started getting all kinds of spam and, um, it -- I just got all, I mean, I just -- it was horrible, so --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- yeah, it's just from, I mean, a lot of undesirable things, just, um, on line casino gambling, I mean, just a whole bunch of stuff that was just [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, and I get that too and, I'm like, I -- I -- I don't, but I haven't visited any, I mean, I --
L:  Oh, I know, th- [NOISE] --
R:  --  I haven't put -- logged in to any kind of casino site, so why are they even sending me this stuff?
L:  I think they just -- they just have your name, I think, you know, I think the way a marketing works sometimes is they just buy a bunch of names or email addresses [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they know that chances are that, ah, so many out of any [NOISE] --
R:  Are going to go on there to look, see what it is or whatever.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  But you know what bothers me about that, you click in there and it -- if it has a place on there where you can, you know, unsubscribe to it, or if you don't want to receive this email or if you received it by --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- accident, if you click on there, half of the time, it sends you to a place that's, you know, is not a good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- address.  Either that or you click on there to unsubscribe and then you still get mail from them anyway.
L:  [NOISE] Oh lovely, yeah --
R:  You know, and you're, like --
L:  -- yeah, 'cause they probably changed the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  You probably have a bunch of different things, but --
L:  Oh, that --
R:  -- I mean, I don't -- you know, see, I did anything in school on computers.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  We did --
R:  -- not even in college.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I did, but I was in -- I was in journalism, so that was probably part of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] But -- but --
R:  You have a little baby.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I, yeah -- I've got a six month old too.
R:  Oh, how sweet.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what'll settle him down here, he didn't want --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to sit in the high chair.  I don't think he likes it.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] So, um, yeah, I -- I found that, um, my daughter had a project to do, um, on, what was it, lions [LAUGH] she's in first grade --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, you know, we have some books around here but nothing had much information in and, um, it was kind of fun to go on line and -- and find stuff.  It -- it's one of those things that sometimes you can find what you need and sometimes you can't.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, it was -- it was helpful not hav- -- not to have to go out to the library 'cause I was pregnant at the time, I think it was a -- in fact about seven or eight months pregnant [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when we were working on the project, so taking a couple of little kids to the -- to the library when you're --
R:  It's not real appealing, right.
L:  -- ah, oh, yeah, you know, 'cause I knew my two year old was gonna just run all over the place.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And so it was nice to be able to do that from home.  I think it, um --
R:  Get on there and the information's there.
L:  You know, I almost wonder whether, you know, I -- the one thing that's kind of frightening is there's too much emphasis placed on it.  I know they're available in schools, well some schools, I mean, I don't know how much access some kids have to them, I know there's one in my daughter's classroom, or, I think there's one, or a couple and --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- then they have a computer lab that they --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- go in to every week, but, um, you know, I don't know what it's like in other school districts.  Do you know what I mean, it's -- it seems kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- scary [NOISE] like at some point -- I mean [NOISE] are we going to have people who we- were in an income bracket where they had computers at home and had all that -- all this access to this information and, you know, and, ah, is there going to be another set of the population that didn't, because, you know, I mean, if you feel -- if your income's only so much, a computer is not a reality at all.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so that's what --
R:  Well, it's ba- -- I mean, that, ah, it's not a necessary expense.  You can live without it.
L:  That's true -- that's true.  Well [LAUGH] --
R:  And then especially when you're having to pay --
L:  If you talk to my husband, he'll argue with you on that.  [LAUGH]
R:  You can't -- well, and then plus, you know, when you have to pay twenty bucks or whatever every month to be on line and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, a- a- an- -- you know, and that kind of thing, yeah, it adds up -- it adds up.
L:  Yeah --
R:  So --
L:  -- it does.
R:  -- but I mean, I just think generally it's a good thing.  I think that they can learn a lot of stuff, I mean, a- and even just the, ah, the computer program, ah, you know, that they have, the -- like Reader Rabbit, and that kind of thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that they have, um, I know my little girl likes to get on there playing, sh- -- it helps her, you know, she'll sing with the song and she'll talk and, you know, matching the letters, and I mean, just the different things on there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I think it's good learning and we -- in our house we don't have that many battery operated toys --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because I like -- I mean we do have some, but I like more the things that make her think --
L:  Exactly, same -- same here.
R:  -- and, um, we read a lot --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I like the toys that, I mean, where she's building something or she's drawing something, I mean I don't --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- care if Lincoln Logs or Legos or Playdoh or something but, to where she has to use her imagination and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- not just, ah, all the battery operated stuff, 'cause I sometimes -- I think that limits their imagination and it will --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it limits them, you know, when all they're doing is just sitting there pushing buttons --
L:  Right, well, and the other --
R:  -- and they're not really thinking.
L:  -- the other thing is, I mean, when -- when they get out in the real world do you want them to be able to think or do you want them to be parrots?
R:  Right.
L:  You know [LAUGH] that's really scary.
R:  And I don't want that.  That's about how I feel about Ritalin.
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you have a kid that's on that?
L:  No, no.
R:  Yeah, that's about how I feel like that.  There are people that they give that -- give them that and that's sort of like it makes them just become this docile little sheep walking in a row with a bunch of other kids where they don't --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Huh.  I just -- I just hadn't heard much about, you know, but, ah, yeah, I don't know, that's a -- that's a -- boy, that's a whole nother area.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it sure is.
L:  But -- but, yeah, it's -- that's --
