R:  Hello.
L:  M- hi.  Um, my name's Elaine.
R:  My name is Drew.
L:  Drew?  Hi.
R:  And I --
L:  It's nice to meet you.  How are you tonight?
R:  And I am in central Kentucky, and you are where?
L:  I am in [inaudible] Pennsylvania.
R:  Okay.  And the question was, "Do we feel like any other countries are threat to us?  And if so, why?"  But did I hear it correctly?
L:  That's -- that's what I heard too, so I guess we'll go with it here.
R:  Okay.  Because when I first logged and they said the question, sometimes I don't understand it, so that --
L:  Mhm.  Have you done these calls before, or ...?
R:  This is my third one.
L:  This is my third one, also.  So, um, yeah, I know.  My first ones were real easy, but this one I thought too w- was -- was a little bit tougher.  Um, I don't know, there's a lot to be said on this, I guess.  Ah, um, what -- what do you think, what -- what's the first thing you think of when they said about the -- if you thought any other countries --
R:  Of course I --
L:  -- w- were a threat?
R:  I think the Middle Eastern countries.
L:  Yes, I'd definitely agree with that.  After -- after ah nine one one I thought, you really have to ask [LAUGH] that?
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  I mean, that's definitely what I'd say would be the number one threat.  You know, I think that's been pretty well proven.
R:  Right.
L:  And I -- and I still think -- I think things are probably a little better with what all we've done, but I still don't rule them out as a threat.
R:  Oh, heavens, no.  I -- I mean it's kind of like I'm watching a [inaudible] type deal.
L:  Exactly.  Yes.  Mhm.
R:  And ah one thing about it, though, is ah they want us over there, they want us to do this, but then they want us to go home.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we just can't leave until --
L:  Right.
R:  -- something else is established because I'm not so sure if Saddam is gone --
L:  We don't know a hundred percent on that, I mean --
R:  -- like I have a pretty good feeling that he is, since he hasn't surfaced.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I kind of -- there's always I guess that doubt, though, because he's so tricky and everything.  I mean it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, you would a -- you almost have to wonder how he possibly could have survived --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, you know, a lot of things seem to lead, you know, pretty close, you know, the fact that he almost has to have been killed, but it's just, I guess, just the way things have been pulled before and all that kind of stuff, there's still that little bit of doubt.  I wouldn't totally rule it out.
R:  Right.  Right.  And but I mean if -- if he isn't, then you know, well, if he is, I mean then he has still got some supporters --
L:  Exactly.  Yes.
R:  -- behind him that were his um puppet men --
L:  Exactly.  And I'm sure some of them would -- would, you know, try their best to carry on because so many of the people like that over there are so brainwashed, you know, that I'm sure they thought that he was doing a wonderful thing, you know --
R:  Well, it's just like Hitler, you know.
L:  Exactly.  Yes.
R:  Hitler brainwashed the people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and first of all, I want to say, you're -- you're a real good one to talk with.  My second one, I mean it was like pulling teeth.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Just to get them to talk.
L:  Well, I've been fortunate.  I um, so far um I mean I've -- I've really lucked out, I didn't really have a problem talking with anybody, so -- but thank you, that's good to hear.  I mean, I'm, you know, enjoying talking with you, too, I mean, you know, I th- I think you're doing great, you make it easy too.
R:  And ah I know this is off the subject, but how did you find out about this?
L:  Um, I got it um email.  I belong to a ah just an organization, it's called like the money and shopping network --
R:  Okay.  'Cause I got mine through ah refunding [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  So, um, just and the lady that posted it, it -- it's um refunding magazine and then they also have a website --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and it -- it does cost us to belong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I pay a yearly fee --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so -- and then the other lady that I talked to, she heard about it from another website.  I think she said the name of it was ideals ideals.  But I tried to find her -- her website and I --
L:  Oh, really?  Hm.
R:  -- and I --
L:  Yeah, that one I'm not familiar with --
R:  I couldn't find --
L:  -- and I mean I've heard of -- I'm not familiar with the refunding websites, but I mean I'm um I know my sister in law used to do quite a bit of that and I think she might have even subscribed to a publication or, you know, got some --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- free publications or something like that.  But like I said, the one I do, it's -- it's like money and shopping dotcom and it's ah and ah you know it's I mean they have different kinds of opportunities like this.  This is the first ah of this type of survey I got into, but they have like some secret shopping opportunities and all that.
R:  Right.  I'd like to be a mystery shopper.
L:  Yeah, well, that's a po- -- a good place to check, it's a real good place to check.
R:  Okay.
L:  The lady's name's Angela and it's like I said, it's money and -- it's just like it says, money and shopping dotcom.
R:  Mhm.  I wrote that down.  And then also there's another one called deal hunters dot com.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  That ah -- that a co worker of mine, that's where she -- she cruises that one and I cruise mine --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then we compare notes.
L:  Oh, that's a good idea too.
R:  Mhm.  And then there's another one that I ran into a lady in the grocery store and hers was my coupon.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  That she does.  So, but I will check out that website.  And another country -- we'll get back to the subject -- --
L:  Yes [LAUGH].
R:  -- that I have --
L:  I guess we better, huh, we're going to get ourselves in trouble here.
R:  Um, the French, you know, aren't that keen with us and I just had a niece that um has been overseas for the last six months on um studying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she was a -- they -- she went over there to an American university thing in Spain and they did some traveling through Europe and this type stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and when they went to France they -- they were asked if they were Americans and they said no they were Canadian, because the French just don't like us.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And so they -- they were told to do that as more of a safety precaution --
L:  Uh-huh.  Really?  Well, that, yeah, that is something.
R:  And I mean they were in --
L:  No, I mean, I always --
R:  -- a group.
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  It was --
L:  -- I always rather liked -- like, I mean I always thought they were allies and everything, I guess since you hear, like about the you know like World War Two and all that and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I just -- I don't know, I always liked it.  I -- I took French in school and -- and I just always thought it was kind of neat [LAUGH] you know, I just -- I always thought if anywhere you know I'd like to go where they speak that and everything, but it's just like anymore, like you said, I -- I'm not even sure why, but they do s- -- I mean, and I hadn't heard any of this before, but they do seem to really have an attitude towards us, I don't know.  And then -- and they definitely weren't going to be any help as far as dealing with the Middle East.  I mean, they made that pretty clear.
R:  Well, one thing I think it was part of it was that um they had sold so many weapons to Saddam.
L:  Mm.
R:  And Saddam owed them money.
L:  Oh.
R:  And that was part of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That they felt like if they buddied up with them they might not get the money and you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and all that money that [inaudible] --
L:  Well, I guess that makes sense.  I hadn't really heard it quite like that, either.  That -- that I guess does make sense, but still.
R:  And all those um that millions of dollars that they found in the wall --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and um I'm just wondering whatever -- whatever became of that and to me it should go back to help rebuild the country.
L:  Oh, definitely, yeah.  But whether -- whether it does is a different story, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  But um trying to think what else.  But I mean as far as you know the Canadians or anybody in South America or Australia, no.  And I mean, even the Japanese, even though they were our enemy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in World War Two, I don't feel a threat with them.
L:  I don't really either, huh uh.  I mean -- I mean I can remember growing up hearing like, you know, always like the greatest threat, I mean communists was a threat and it's like, you know, Russia and all that and I mean that doesn't seem to be, again I guess maybe it's a little bit in the back of your mind and you wouldn't totally rule it out, but I mean they -- they don't seem to be any real threat anymore, either.
R:  No, because they kind of fell apart.
L:  They kind of fell apart and things changed over there, too.  So, I -- I -- I really -- really don't see that as being a threat, either.  And I think most of the, you know, yeah, like the -- like the neighboring countries and -- and all that.  [inaudible] though, I'm not too sure about.
R:  Oh yeah.  I -- I forgot about him.
L:  But I mean ah you know, most of the other ones, you know, like Canada and -- and um Mexico and like Great Britain and all that I -- I think you know seem to be pretty -- pretty much of an ally yet.
R:  And ah -- and I always -- I always like to travel to most of their countries --
L:  Mhm.  Have you done any traveling abroad or anything?
R:  Been to a couple of places.  Been to -- but it -- it -- been to Australia [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, really?  That would be neat.
R:  That was back -- that was almost ten years ago.
L:  Really?  I've never been out of the country [inaudible].  I've ever e- -- never ever been as far as your State, to be honest with you, just really don't travel a lot, but ah mm I've really only been like a you know, a few places in our country, which is even just like neighboring states, like Virginia, West Virginia, New York, that kind of thing.  But ah -- but I mean I think it would be interesting.  Although right now, the way the tensions were, I'm -- and they way they said about air travel and everything, I'm not sure if I would have been real anxious this past year, so ...
R:  Well, we flew to Philadelphia, spring break --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and um things were
