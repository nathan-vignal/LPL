R:  Hi, Robert.
L:  Hi.  Um, my name's Louise.
R:  Oh, hi.  How're you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Okay.
L:  And -- and I'm for Massachusetts.
R:  I'm from California.
L:  California.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, this is a -- a little bit of an unusual subject, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um --
R:  But interesting though.
L:  Yeah, I mean I -- I guess my -- my thoughts on it would be that some of these smaller countries are -- that, uh, might have terrorists and things like that that would be radical in their actions and not think about sacrificing themselves to blow up things like the World Trade Center are probably the most --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dangerous to -- to, uh, the United States.
R:  Yeah, so you're saying that, um, a small country like, um, Kuwait or, um, well, a country -- uh, countries in, um, in the Pers- Persian Gulf or --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, even -- even like just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- where we -- you know, I -- I -- I honestly don't follow a lot of the foreign policy as closely as I probably should --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, you know, I don't think -- it's definitely not like it was with the -- the cold war where you have a country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like Russia or something.  I don't think that we really have to be too awful concerned about some country like Russia or, uh, you know, France or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- somebody like that.
R:  Well, but I still think we gotta be concerned about, you know, some -- there is still a little concern over Russia but also now Korea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, [MN] um, what you call it?  Even Cuba.  I'm Cuban so --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah, so Castro is still in power.  He's still communist and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's ninety miles from, um, Miami.
L:  Yeah.  That's --
R:  That's a threat right then and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and getting back to what you were saying about, uh., yeah I think that's a -- that's a very, uh, dangerous, uh, situation where they got those people that have no, uh, no believe in the sacred- sacredness of life and look what they did to New York.
L:  I know, yeah.  Yeah, they -- I mean, peo- people who feel like they have a -- I don't know, a --
R:  Sacred duty to, uh, to blow things up for God, you know, that's scary.
L:  Yeah, very scary.  You know, people -- um, um --
R:  Oh, can I ask you a question?  Uh, what do you think about -- well, we're sending money to this foreign, uh -- sending money to this country to help, um, some of those people.  All this money that we send goes to, uh, people who, um, are terrorists so I don't know if we just be sending money to, uh, countries like that.  Okay, you know, Bush said that Syria, Iraq, Iran, now Korea --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the list -- axis of evil, right?
L:  Uh --
R:  Well, why the heck are we sending so much money to them?
L:  I know.  The -- uh, supposedly it's supposed to be to help them, uh, you know, rebuild and probably to get people that we like more in power over there but when we have people in our country that --
R:  Oh, Lord.
L:  -- who -- who, uh, I don't know, could use a lot of assistance as well it seems --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes that we spend an awful lot on -- on helping people in other countries when we could be helping --
R:  Helping our own.
L:  -- our own people a lot more than we do.
R:  Yes, instead of sending billions of dollars to countries that doesn't even like us.  You know, that they hate us to death.  We should be helping people in our country.  Look at how much homelessness they got here and we're sending billions and trillions of dollars to these people that are gonna use it to kill us
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and they could very well or the [inaudible] -- different people -- it's almost like it's a -- it's a -- it's a bribe for them to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, um, to try to buy, you know, their, uh, contentness with the United States like, you know, saying well or it's because we're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a rich country we can, you know, get the sympathies of a certain amount of the populations in those countries I think by --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- giving them foreign aid.
R:  And you know something that happened -- let me ask you what -- what -- what state you in again?
L:  I'm in Massachusetts.
R:  Okay, let me ask a question.  Um, what would you say, uh, instead of sending money to other countries, h- how's your, um, homeless population there?  Is it ...?
L:  Around here?  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there -- there are sections.  Like in Boston it's --.  I'm -- I'm a little south of Boston.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and -- and there's not much around here because I live in a very, you know, uh, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- small town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but some of the bigger cities and Boston and Worsted[?] and stuff, they have quite a -- quite a big population.  I know like this winter with it being so cold around here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they didn't have enough homeless shelters --
R:  Jesus.
L:  -- for -- for the number of homeless people there were and there were people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- literally dying in the streets in the --
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  -- winter time because there was --
R:  See, instead of sending so much money -- I mean,  -- I believe -- I believe we should money out for the countries but, you know, don't send out so much.  You know save some money, keep it here in the United States.  Help people who are homeless and instead of sending billions of dollars to, uh, -- you know, like we were talking to people who are, you know, who have the same moral values we Americans do or same belief system that -- they -- they have different ideas that cor- corrupt governments and we're sending money to countries that are so corrupt.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, you know, they use to build nuclear -- nuclear bombs and stuff to destroy all the countries.  It's -- --it's -- it's ric -- it's ridiculous.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I have to agree with you there [LAUGH].
R:  Geeze, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know we should spend a little money on -- on here people homeless or hungry so -- out here in California, in LA where I live -- I live in Hollywood, West Hollywood --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and we got some many people home- I go out to a restaurant with my wife --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I can't go out to a restaurant without somebody coming over asking me for money.
L:  Really?
R:  I feel awful, you know. 
L:  Wow.
R:  So, thus I gave him money because I can but when I can, I can but it breaks my heart.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So much homeliness down here.  It's like so much money the government has and look at all these people in the street without -- some -- it's not even -- though some of them it's not their fault.  They lost their job, you know.  You know, they lost their job, they lose their home and it's out of their control and [MN] I know people who lost their house, they lost their job, that can't even find a job and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- there's no job and we're sending money to other countries to assist.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We so must -- go ahead.
L:  I was just gonna ask you, is -- is the -- what's the econ -- economy like there in -- in your area?  Is it difficult [NOISE] to get a job or ...?
R:  Oh, now it is, yeah.
L:  Is it?
R:  I'm lucky I have a job but --
L:  Yeah, aroun- I mean, around here there's a lot of the companies are letting off people that had, um, you know, executives or higher up people earning higher salaries but for the -- the entry level jobs in places, you know, like if you wanted a -- any kind of entry level job, people -- it -- it's -- it's crazy.  You can't even go to a store and expect that there are going to be cashiers there because people are dying to have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people work but nobody can afford to -- to live on the salaries that they're paying those entry level positions --
R:  It's ridiculous.
L:  -- you know.
R:  It's like the government don't care about -- you know, the United States, we're sending so much money over -- I don't know, it's like -- I don't know.
L:  Do -- do you think that the -- that us sending foreign aid to other countries reduces the threat of some of those countries to us?
R:  No, not really.
L:  You don't think so?
R:  No, but sure we're -- we're doing that for -- for centuries and nothing would change.  We're still -- there's still so much danger out there and now Korea, Cuba, even Russia.  Some -- some places in Russia are very anti American.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're really --well, get us to and like some parts of Russia -- I don't believe communism is dead and I still believe that there's still communism.  So, I grew up in communism and now I --
L:  Now, did -- did you grow up in Cuba?
R:  Yeah, well I was there until I was eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think -- still think though we shouldn't be sending so much -- I mean, I'm not saying we shouldn't send our money out to other countries --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but the -- the amount that we are sending is -- is way too much already.
L:  Right, right.
R:  It's way too much.
L:  Yeah, I -- I agree.  We should -- we should spend it on our --
R:  On our own people here.
L:  -- on our, yeah.
R:  Like we were talking that there's so much homelessness, so much hungriness, all here in this -- even in California here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, LA is a beautiful city, it's a great city to live in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but there's so much misery here too.  It's incredible.
L:  Wow.  I know it's -- it's probably even more so there because, you know, I don't know, from a -- I've never been to that part of the country but [NOISE] you know, everything I see on TV or whatever it's -- you know, you have the richest of the rich out there and probably, you know, the -- the poorest of the poor too living almost side by side sometimes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or, um, a- at least that's what it seems like from, uh, I don't know, from this end of the country [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  No, it's okay.  It's not that bad but no, when -- when we were having our recession, no, it was -- it's bad for everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For rich, for poor and also when we -- we were having our recession, we're still sending so much money out to other countries.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That doesn't make sense at all.
L:  I know.  I know around here --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- even like the -- the towns and the school systems they're --
R:  Yeah, I've been reading about that.
L:  -- they're -- they're having a real hard time.  I mean, we don't even have school buses in my town anymore and they're laying off teachers and, um, you know, losing sports and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, music and all sorts of things in the school system because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they can't afford it and the buildings are falling apart because they're so old and unsafe but the kids still have to go to school.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they send -- you know, the kids are -- are the future of this country, you know --
R:  Right, and --
L:  -- and we need to -- to teach them well and to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- have them be in safe buildings and things --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all the --
R:  And here we are sending billions and trillions of dollars to countries that -- like you know what I'm saying, no?
L:  Yeah, maybe ...
