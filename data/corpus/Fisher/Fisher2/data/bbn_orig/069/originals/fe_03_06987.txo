L:  Hi.  My name is Trina and you are?
R:  My name is Karen.  How are you Trina?
L:  I'm all right.
R:  W- where do you live?
L:  Here in Birmingham, Alabama.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, what did she say about the top- -- I know the topic is education.  But, what else -- what -- 
L:  Education.
R:  -- was the rest of the sentence?
L:  Do you feel that computers help or hinder?
R:  Computers -- 
L:  Computers are good or bad?
R:  -- help or hinder.  That's an interesting question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think?  How old are you?
L:  I am twenty three.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, you -- see you're young.  You kind of grew up with them.  I'm forty nine.
L:  Right.
R:  So, to me I really had -- I really had a hard time overcoming this fear of technology.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?  But, do you think they help too?
L:  I think they did to a certain extent.  Some people [several inaudible words] they grew up where all you had to do was put the information into either a computer or calculator.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't know how to do basic addition and subtraction -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- so that's not good.  Ah, yeah, that's the thing [several inaudible words].  I have [several inaudible words] on an order and I have a [several inaudible words] 'cause I mean, what's going on with this?  I've got it.  I've paid for [several inaudible words] --  
R:  Hello?  [pause]
L:  All right thanks.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Yes, ma'am.
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Okay, there's [several inaudible words].  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I had another caller come in.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's okay.  [LAUGH] I was starting to think, "Uh-oh, I hope they don't just cut it off".  Um, yeah, ah, you know, I kind of agree with that.  If you -- you know, if you put everything in there then maybe it can spit out the answers for you.  But, nothing replaces good old fashioned thinking.  [LAUGH]  You know?  I mean, being able to solve problems on your feet isn't all that easy.  But, I do think, I mean, now that I've gotten on the internet and I, you know, [LAUGH] can buy books and -- and all this other stuff, you know, that -- I mean, basically I can learn so much from the internet I think that it's actually --  
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- a big help.
L:  [several inaudible words] Thank you.  Bye, bye.  Oh.  Well, it has it's benefits too because everything now is pretty much on computer.  Hello? 
R:  Hi.
L:  Yeah.  [pause]
R:  Yes, it does have it's benefits.
L:  Yeah, it does have its benefits 'cause just about everything you do now is computerized and if you don't know how to maneuver around a computer, you're going to have problems.
R:  Well, you know, I think too I really, um, I don't know how well you followed the Microsoft thing with Bill Gates.  I really think it's bad that he has such a monopoly on -- on software and software programing but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that's not too unusual from any other industry in the United States, you know?  I mean -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you have money and you get to the top, you can pretty well [LAUGH] eliminate the competition.
L:  Mhm.  Well, like you say, that's with everything.  If you come out with something better, then true enough you'll have a hard enough time trying to get it out there because everybody's already using what they're familiar with.
R:  Right.
L:  But -- 
R:  Like, my boyfriend has a Mac and he loves his Mac and he hates my PC.
L:  Right.
R:  He hates Windows.  He hates Bill Gates.  It's -- you know, he keeps swearing it's so much easier on an Apple.  But, I was trained on a PC that's how I learned.  So, this to me is easier than suddenly going over to a Macintosh, you know?
L:  But -- 
R:  But --  
L:  -- then again you have to look at with the whole computer thing.  When they first came out it was like, oh, well it's -- [several inaudible words] much, much easier than go ahead and do this out on paper or to use a calculator and now it's like paper and calculator is unheard of.
R:  I know.  [LAUGH]--
L:  So -- 
R:  Yeah, but, you know, sometimes it's funny.  Like, if I'm in a store or something and you're waiting for an order to print out or something, you know?  You will actually have people say, "I could have written this up faster".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And maybe that's true but it -- you know, it doesn't -- it doesn't give you all the data protection and backup that you need.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, at the same time as it's printing it out it's also deleting one of those from your stock or -- or doing whatever.  So, um, you know, I would have to say that if we could just get, like -- let me see.  Bill Gates could take all his money and use it to send everyone in the United States to school, which evidently --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- he has enough.  He could.  He has enough money.  He could send everyone in the United States to college and still have plenty of money to live on.  Isn't that sad?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it's sad because he's not going to do it.  But, he -- [LAUGH] you know, and he did that, then that would really mean that computers were helpful through education.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] I know it's kind of a backwards way of looking at it.  But -- 
L:  That is definitely one perspective.  Uh-huh -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I can't help it.  I'm in OA.  I have weird look -- weird ways of --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- looking at things.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  That was definitely one way that I have never thought of.
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Interesting.
R:  Well, out here in California we have, ah, very bad budget problems.  I'm sure you have them too in Alabama because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Bush is giving everyone tax cuts and -- and he -- at the same time he's cutting all funds to the state and so our governor is having to raise taxes on us to pay for state services that the federal government had p- paid for previously or promised --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- to pay for or whatever, right? 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, anyway -- you know, I mean, teachers are losing their jobs and you know, it -- it's -- it's impacting libraries and parks and all sorts of things like that.  But, now the funny thing was today they published in the LA Times that his partner Auer[?] -- what -- what is his name?  Anyway the one that started Microsoft with him -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he wants a tax break back.  Evidently he has a company -- he's worth billions of dollars, he's [LAUGH] -- he -- he's, you know, one of the richest men in the world -- Paul Auer -- one of the richest men in the world.  But, a couple of years' ago the state of California took away the tax break for his company and he --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wants it back now.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, this is what kills me is that, you know, all these rich people seem to think they're entitled.  Once they get rich they're entitled to keep all their money and not contribute to anything, you know?
L:  Mhm -- 
R:  And you go over to Europe and -- and you have wonderful social programs for people.  You know, you don't have kids that -- that, you know, are s- -- well, I hate to say starving, but they're malnourished.  They don't get enough food at home, you know?  I mean, you have education programs that are important.  You have healthcare and socialized medicine and here we get tax cuts that we don't need.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So, anyway, but he's -- ah, you know, that's another part of, you know, w- why does, you know, this, "Do computers help education?"  Well, in this case definitely not because his lobbying for a tax cut, he spent a hundred and eighty five thousand dollars alone this year in lobbyists -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- to try to get his tax cut back.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]  And, um, and if he just took that money and -- and donated computers to schools, just think how much better that would be.  You know?
L:  Okay.  But, again you're saying that the computers need to be there it's just the people that have made so much money off of the computers that aren't so good.
R:  Well --
L:  The actual -- 
R:  You know, it -- 
L:  -- need for computers is there.
R:  [several inaudible words] It's not even that that -- [MN] -- they're -- the people are bad necessarily that make computers.  I think they simply, um, should -- I would like to see a fairer playing field.  A more even playing field than what we have now and I think that we're going in the opposite direction of that.  Now the more money you make your tax cut is actually going down.  Instead of paying thirty eight percent if you're in the top brackets, now you're only going to have to pay thirty five percent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you know?  And yet -- and -- and there were a lot of people that lost all of their money in the tech boom so perhaps that's their comeuppance, you know?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, all of a sudden all these nerds were rich and they were buying -- um, a friend of mine lives --
