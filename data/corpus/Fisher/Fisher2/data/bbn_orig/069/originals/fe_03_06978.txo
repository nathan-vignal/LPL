R:  Hi.
L:  Hello, this -- 
R:  Hi, I'm Regina from New York.
L:  I'm Rosetta from north Carolina.
R:  How are you?
L:  Fine.
R:  Good.  Do you want to start?
L:  Well, what do I think about education and computers?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  I think they serve a purpose but I think people are getting too dependent on them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um -- but, at the same time children that are in school and that are slow to catch on, a lot of the computer games are good for them, especially for the hand eye coord- coordination -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think.
R:  I -- I agree with you.  I think that we are getting too dependent on them to some extent but I think they are -- they do have a benefit 'cause some of those -- some of the things they do have for the children are really good.  The thing, I think, is that -- that we're making them rely too much on them and are missing some of the basics sometimes that they have to just learn because, you know, now they know if you put the numbers in the computer you get the answer but they don't really know what's behind it.  But, otherwise I do think a lot of the things out there are really good for them.
L:  Right.  [MN] Same way I feel about calculators.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  With calculators, they just depend on that.  They don't learn how to count.
R:  No, that's true.  That's true.  Are you in education at all? 
L:  Mm, mm, no.  I'm not in education.  I'm a childcare provider.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And by using a calculator 'cause there were so many little tricks that we -- we were taught young on how to do the numbers, how some of 'em was use your hand.
R:  Right.
L:  They don't -- they don't learn those things anymore.
R:  No.  And the thing is then they -- they get so dependent by not knowing that they don't even know if the answer's right or wrong.  They may have pushed a wrong button and they don't realise it because they don't know, you know, what they were supposed to get out of it or have an idea.  I know that -- that we've been seeing that with the children.
L:  Right, because I'd -- I w- watch them do their +times tables.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, my granddaughter goes to a school.  Ah, they don't allow calculators.  You got to be in at least fifth grade before you can have a calculator.
R:  Yes.
L:  At least.  And you got to know all your times table and they sing -- that -- they learn 'em like we did.  We sang them.  We spoke them.  We -- and this is the way I think education should be.
R:  Yes.  It's a repetition.  Yes.
L:  And then when they know 'em they really know 'em.  They'll last with them.  You know?  This is what my granddaughter say to me sometime, "Oh, grandma, how'd you get that number so quick?"  I said, "Because I was taught how to add and subtract".
R:  Right.
L:  I didn't have to depend on a calculator.  She'll be, "Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Let me get a calculator".  No.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  No.  Pencil, pen, in your head.
R:  Yes.
L:  And they're so -- they're so many little maths tricks to -- you know, to help you.  You know, it's just hard for me to -- to deal with that sometimes.
R:  Well, I think too that it keeps your mind going and keeps it active that you have to think about it.  You know, as -- whereas if you're just doing something where you're not even thinking about it, you know, your mind gets a little soft.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  And this is why there're so many kids that are avoiding school.
R:  Yes.
L:  And that's when they start getting in trouble -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because they're bored.  They don't have enough to hold their interest because they haven't been taught that.
R:  Right. 
L:  You know -- 
R:  And I think it al- -- 
L:  -- they haven't been taught to sit down and -- and to -- to really read and you know, everything is, "Oh, okay, I [inaudible]".  Well, if there's a book -- I mean, I can remember when I was younger if it was a book and I wanted to read and I wanted the book, right, I would try to find a -- the story someplace else, you know, like, "Oh, Helen of Troy.  Okay, there's a Helen of Troy movie".
R:  Mhm.
L:  See, right.  But, of course it wasn't the same as in the book but now they go on line and get some answers for everything.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  So, they don't even have to bother.
L:  So, therefore they miss a lot.
R:  Yes.
L:  And you know, I also look at it, as far as education is concerned, they don't learn about the United States or foreign countries.  They have no id- -- they have no idea why we're at war.
R:  Yes.
L:  They have no idea.  They don't know the background behind it.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, this is stuff that we had to -- we had to learn this stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  So, like I say, I had the kids [several inaudible words], "Well, how do you know all that stuff?"  I say, "Well, number one, I'm older and I was taught this in school".  They don't have real history anymore.  They don't know nothing about history.
R:  No.
L:  And I resent that.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because if they don't know history how are they going to advance?  And -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- they wonder why students come into the United States and do better than they do because they have to learn the history.
R:  Right.  Right -- 
L:  They don't even know the history of the United States.
R:  Yes.
L:  Which is mm.  See, education is just getting sloppy so I feel like parents -- and like, I said, I'm a childcare provider.  Childcare providers and things like that have to teach 'em if the schools don't teach 'em.
R:  Mhm.  Or to push that they have to learn these things, that they're necessary.
L:  Well, it -- it's necessary for more than w- -- so, that they can advance.  They can understand why they do the things they do.  They have no idea.  They just do 'em because somebody said, "Do".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But to understand.
R:  Right.  Right -- 
L:  You know?
R:  No, I -- I agree with that.  I think it -- things have changed too much.
L:  Everybody's looking for a quick fix.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  No, I don't -- my -- my children are just starting out.  My son's in first grade but you can see the big different.  But, then you can also see the difference in the older grades too from what we were required than from what they're required now.  It's a lot less.
L:  They claim they're looking for more, but it's not.
R:  No.
L:  It's not.  It's really -- it's really not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I mean, I understand they teach 'em these concepts and all these fancy names.  Hey, it's mathematics.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] -- 
L:  It's -- 
R:  -- right.  
L:  -- arithmetic.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, you can give it a fancy name, but, okay, are they going to be able to use this? 
R:  Yes.  No, you're right.  You're right.  No, I know.  My -- my husband's a math teacher and he's getting [MN] -- he's amazed at what they don't know.  You know, just basic -- 
L:  Well -- well, I know that I am.
R:  Yes.
L:  I -- I know that I am, you know, because -- I'll put it like this.  I can remember.  I had the same math teacher that my mother had [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when I was in, ah, junior high school.  And my mother told me, "It ain't going to be easy if you haven't learnt the basics" and when she had taught me the basics, it was easy for me.
R:  Right.  [MN] No and that's -- that's the one thing that they're -- they're not learning that anymore.  They're not w- -- they -- and they are becoming too dependent on the calculators and you know, getting easy answers and not understanding what's behind it.  No, I know, he -- he sees that a lot and I know with my son, we push him.  They've -- they had maths homework in first grade where they wanted them to use the calculator and I wrote a note to the teacher saying, I'm sorry -- 
L:  In first grade.
R:  -- but we're not -- we're not doing that.  He's going to have to -- 
L:  In first -- 
R:  -- figure it out.
L:  -- grade?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  I -- I said -- and -- and so there answer was, "Well, we're introducing technology".  I said, "They'll have to learn the basics first".
L:  Oh, my goodness.  So, they'll -- ooh, that -- that -- that's not good at all.
R:  Well, it was interesting because that was the one and only time I fought them so I'm -- I'm hoping that that had an effect because I said, "That's not technology.  That's teaching him how to push buttons.  But, if they don't understand what's behind it, then it really doesn't matter that you teach him how to push the buttons".
L:  The easy way out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's not good.  That is not good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, anyhow, like I said, unfortunately that's -- that's the way it is and like I say, kids don't read anymore.  They, um, sit and they watch television and -- and then they think that they know the story and you can't tell them anything because they know it, "Oh, I've seen this on Blankety Blank" -- 
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- you know?  That's not the story.  You know?  They don't know --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about making book reports.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, they [MN] -- they have to do 'em but, ah [several inaudible words] my granddaughter goes to a private school and right now she has to do a book report.  I mean, she has to go to the library -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so that means that day her mother has to take time and take her to the library.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it's not just the child that -- you know, parents have to do a few things too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It may be inconvenient but, you know -- 
R:  But, that's part of it.  That's -- that's -- 
L:  It may be inconvenient but, if this is your child's future, to me -- 
R:  Right, that's important.
L:  -- um, my inconvenience is nothing compared to reassure that she's ready to live in the world that we live in today.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, if I miss the television show or I'm a little tired, hey, my momma did it.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  She bought encyclopedias but we didn't depend on encyclopedias.  She would take, um -- she would take us to the library and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, do what had to be done.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's what I feel parents should do now.  They under use the library.
R:  Yes.  That's true.
L:  They under use it.
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  No, ah, that -- that we know too because, ah, I know in my son's case the -- the class went and they asked them who had a card, you know, a library card.  And he was one of the few --
