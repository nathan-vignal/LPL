R:  Hi, this is Reva from Wisconsion.  And who am I speaking to?
L:  Hi, this is Rita from Virginia.
R:  Oh, how about that?  I get your name very often.  [LAUGH].
L:  I get yours fairly frequently too.
R:  Oh, mine's spelled R.E.V. as in Victor A so you probably don't h- hear that very much.
L:  More Reba.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we're discussing countries and what --
L:  That may be a threat to US.
R:  And what other country would think is going to be worse than Iraq or Iran right now?
L:  Or Afghanistan.
R:  Or, yeah, that's true.  Hm.
L:  Or Korea.
R:  Ah, I suppose.  I suppose.  That could be there too.
L:  Or, well I suppose mostly Panama and -- and ah Honduras have been taken care of, mostly.
R:  Yeah.  I would think so.
L:  But there's still some stuff going on down there.
R:  Okay.  And what do you think about Russia?
L:  I think they're fairly friendly now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They've got enough of their own worries to take care of.
R:  I guess, yeah.  And China, too.
L:  Well, I guess I would still consider China a potential threat.
R:  And it's weird that we import stuff from there, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know [LAUGH].
L:  All they got to do is get together with Japan and you have all those people and all that funding.
R:  Oooh, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, and we're getting more of 'em in here, in our country, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, where'd you say you were from?
L:  I'm in Virginia.
R:  Oh, Virginia.  Oh, okay.
L:  Just outside of DC.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  We were just there last fall for a trip through um -- I'm trying to think of the town it was -- where -- Williamsburg.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  And not really eager to fly at that time, but that was set up ahead of time, so -- and now what do you think about the planes with their [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] you know, the bombers that have been on there and how they're trained to check the things at the airports?
L:  I feel fairly good about flying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it gets me to where I want to go and even with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the problems they've had, it's still has like less problems than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- driving overall.
R:  But it's weird how they parcel out different ones to -- to check everything and others they'll just let them go right on by.
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know.
L:  -- that is weird.
R:  Yeah.  I know they have to do it as a random search, but you'd think if you're going to check one, you should check all and we wouldn't mind the extra wait, you know.
L:  Well, they're -- I've -- I've had to do like um I had a flight scheduled and I actually made the reservations nine eleven, right before everything hit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so they changed 'em because I was flying out of Reagan National.
R:  Oh.  Hm.
L:  But they didn't tell me they'd changed them.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  So, I had to change them the day I went.
R:  Hm.
L:  I got searched twice that day.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, they target people who do last minute changes and things like that.
R:  I suppose, yeah.
L:  So, anything that's suspicious, a -- yeah, we're going to search that person.
R:  And it seems that when we're waiting, you know, between planes the first one that got up to the line to be on first, it seemed that they were also checking them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, just as a reason I guess, so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, we had made reservations right before nine eleven too and so it was going to be later in October, so I had to go.  Otherwise I would not have and then we were flying to Pennsylvania and they wouldn't let us leave Chicago because there'd been a -- an alert on Three Mile Island.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I did know -- not know that Three Mile Island was inside you know, by Pennsylvania, I just always assumed it was out on the coast, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they'd had a threat there, so they couldn't let us go until the next morning so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we know that they're trying their best but, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  You've got to live with a lot of stuff these days.
R:  I guess.  So, how long have you been doing this studies -- ah these surveys?
L:  The surveys of ...?
R:  Of, the one that -- Fisher one that we're doing.
L:  Oh, this is just the second time I've talked.
R:  Oh, mine also.
L:  Yeah.  Ah the first time I talked about friendship, so ...
R:  Oh.  Mhm.
L:  Mm.  I'm not big on the current events questions, but --
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  -- my dad was Army all the time I was growing up --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and ah so I know a little bit about threatening ah with other countries --
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  -- and I remember very well the places he was sent ah without us because it was --
R:  I see.
L:  -- too dangerous for the family to go along.
R:  Hm.
L:  He spent a year in Korea.
R:  Oh.  My husband did too back during the Korean conflict.
L:  Yeah, well this was --
R:  And that was an unaccompanied tour, probably.  Huh?
L:  Yeah.  This was during Desert Storm.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  He routed a communications hub through there.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my dad's a communications guy.
R:  Oh.  Mhm.
L:  Fortunately he's recently retired from the IRR, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he can't be called.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He has enough problems with like his knee and things they probably wouldn't come anyway.
R:  Oh, I see.  Mhm.
L:  But he's very bright and very useful with communications.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he's been recognized.
R:  I see.
L:  By the powers that be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for his abilities, so ...
R:  Well, they were probably glad to have him then, huh?
L:  Well, they still are.  He's a Department of Army civilian now.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I see.  Mhm.
L:  Just the thing is now they won't send him overseas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which lets the rest of us rest a little easier.
R:  Yeah, because who knows what country, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things could pop up in?  Now, my husband was in the service for twenty two and a half years so we were different places too, but of course he got to go to Vietnam unaccompanied and Korea --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- unaccompanied.  So, we never got an overseas tour, but --
L:  We got three years in Germany, with all of us there.
R:  Oh, wow.  Hm.
L:  But ah dad got Korea, Egypt and Honduras.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Um, Egypt was considered an exercise because it was less than two months.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But it was back in the eighties when they were -- a lot of the hijackings going on --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- back when the guys in green still had to wear their BDUs on flights.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  And they -- first thing the terrorists hijacking the planes would do is shoot the military guys --
R:  Oh, I suppose.
L:  -- so, that's when they started letting them wear civilian clothes --
R:  Civvies, uh-huh.
L:  -- on civilian flights.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, I don't know if that was any less worrisome than the ones that are now, those suicide ones.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  You know.
L:  -- at least now the people who might have a clue as to what to do once they recognize it will still be alive on the plane.
R:  Mhm [LAUGH].
L:  Which is kind of a nice thought.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah. [PAUSE] Well, my family had never been in the service, just brothers had been but -- ah, it's a different life, for sure.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Something like four and six years at a time we were at one place, so that wasn't too bad with kids in school, you know.
L:  What do you think about France, as far as a threat?
R:  Oh, I wouldn't think there'd be much -- that much of a threat, but then we never know, I guess.
L:  I guess it's just odd to me, I heard a friend had gone over there recently ah for a trip and he was with a tour group --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and one of the things they saw the last day there was a place where they burned George W an effigy every --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- day.
R:  Oh.
L:  And --
R:  Poof.  Really?
L:  -- ah -- so even though they don't seem too much like the type that would really take us out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few people who live there --
R:  Well, I suppose.  Now, what part of France?
L:  -- but -- he was in Paris.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So
R:  Yeah.  One would not think that you'd have to worry about that.  Hm.
L:  Well, it just bothers me when a country kind of semi sanctions their people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- taking care of another country's leader in that fashion.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is alarming.  Hm.  And that was how recent, then?
L:  Ah, this was a couple of months ago.
R:  A couple of months ago, hm.
L:  So.
R:  Well, hm.
L:  Recent enough to be concerned about.
R:  I guess, yeah.  Hm.
L:  I'm wondering how much our powers that be know about that.
R:  Mhm.  Hm.
L:  But ah --
R:  Yeah, that would be surprising.
L:  Course, they still have all kinds of monuments to Napoleon over there.
R:  I suppose.  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He thought he should rule all of Europe.
R:  [LAUGH] And do you think all the countries are saying when they've, you know, gotten rid of some of their nuclear um warriors or the weapons that they're really doing that?
L:  One can hope.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I think more likely they take them apart a little bit so they're not useable --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but keep the parts around so they could put them back together if they had to.
R:  And taking them down underground, like wherever they figure what's his name is?  Mhm.
L:  Possibly.
R:  Yeah.  Well, they have to know that they couldn't be sitting there and just waiting.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  There's a certain amount of ah chemical signa- signature, I guess, that can be registered --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from satellites.
R:  Oh, mhm.
L:  That would have to be concealed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- by something that
