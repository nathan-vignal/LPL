R:  Hello.  My name is Heidi.
L:  Well, my name's Joanne and --
R:  Hi, Joanne.
L:  I'm in California.  Where are you?
R:  I am in Michigan.
L:  Well, I've had --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're -- you're the second call I've had in Michigan. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no kidding.
L:  Yeah.  I don't remember where the other lady was from, what town, but I do know she was in Michigan. [SIGH]
R:  How are you?
L:  Oh, I'm -- uh, what did you say?
R:  How are you?
L:  Oh, I'm pretty good.
R:  Good.
L:  Yeah.  I'm always surprised when they call me.  I always forget that I signed up for this. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, this is my third and final call and I'm -- I'm kinda disappointed, I'd like to keep doing it.
L:  Yeah, it is kinda fun, isn't it?
R:  Oh, it is, it is.
L:  Yeah.  Let's see, the education -- uh, computers in school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Is that?  Oh well, I'm --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all for 'em.  I don't know why [LAUGH] anybody --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- wouldn't be.
R:  Um, I -- I have to agree and I guess the reason why I'm for them is because, um, I have a -- a student that is a sophomore in high school and I have a student, um, that is in third grade so it's a pretty big difference --
L:  Wow, it is.
R:  -- and, um, I've seen the impact that, um, the computers have had, um, on -- on both the kids, um, and my daughter, which is the oldest --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, she, obviously has had more time with computers but it has really helped homework, it has helped, um, studying, study guides.  There's just a lot of advantages to 'em and my third grader, or going to be third grader should say, this is only the second grade, um, has had less time with the computers but they've been more advanced and there is a lot of the times where he will show me things to do with it I didn't know.
L:  Oh.
R:  If I don't know I'll say, you know, "Hey, can you come and help me?" and sure enough --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know [LAUGH] he does and it just -- it really surprises me every time and it's not that he's just extraordinary smart, it's just that I think computers have helped him along the way.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sure and also if you -- you have to.  I have a -- a web TV computer and when I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When I first got it, first month I didn't know where I was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I -- I mean, if you're not used to working them like children are these days, I sometimes would -- would get to the point where I never would get back to the home. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  And -- and -- and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So I -- I could understand it and course the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The children's minds are much quicker now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, my problem was that, I don't know whether the kids do this, but I would -- I would get a link and that looked good so I'd go on to another one and I spent all afternoon --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- doing things like that and it -- it was [COUGH] pure entertainment for me but I could understand how if -- if kids are interested in a certain subject how they could really learn a lot about it.
R:  Well, absolutely and I mean, my -- my daughter's homework [LAUGH] you know, she needs to do a report on, you know, Queen Elizabeth the third, well, the first thing she does is, you know, "I have to go on the internet" and [LAUGH] sure enough --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know [LAUGH] you name it and she finds it.
L:  Yeah, yeah, although sometimes I find that the information is -- is too general --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, uh, uh -- I don't, with this, uh, web TV that I have, I -- there's some links that I can't -- I -- I can't get.
R:  Oh, no kidding.
L:  [MN] Yeah, um, it has something to do with the publisher, I don't know.  They throw something up on the screen and say that they're unable to get the page I want which is -- I don't know why but [LAUGH] they do it every once in a while.  It only -- only gets me upset is because I'm really interested in finding more information so I --
R:  Right.
L:  I sometimes go down to the library and, um, they --
R:  [MN]
L:  They showed me how to use that one down there and then I'm okay.
R:  It just sounds like they're trying to get you to buy a computer rather than [LAUGH] a web TV.  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, but, yeah, I understand, there's -- there are times that, you know, you -- you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Even if you don't know exactly what you're looking for and you put in, um, information in the search engine, you know, you have to be vague because you don't know --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- but [SIGH] you know --
L:  Do you use it, the computer very much?
R:  Oh, um, every day, several times a day.
L:  [MN]
R:  I belong to a -- a refund page, um, and I look on that every day.  I'm very into refunding and -- and couponing and, uh, I do that every day and I email my friends and family every day and read the newspaper where I came from [LAUGH] every day online, so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's great.
R:  Well, it's a little --
L:  I never -- I never thought about that.
R:  Yep.
L:  So ...  Well, we're supposed to be talking about school computers but I don't think we are, are we?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, kind of, yeah, because, you know, like I said --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I know that it -- it does help my kids in school and -- and, um -- but [SIGH] you know and if it -- if -- if it -- if we have to raise more money to -- to help with, you know, the -- get more computers in school, I'm all for that as well because --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- especially with, um, you know, losing teachers [LAUGH] obviously yearly now --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, we need all the help that we can for our kid's edu- -- education and the school computers if -- if that --
L:  Yeah, I'm wondering --
R:  You know, if we have to raise millage [MN] raise millage.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I'm wondering if -- if some of the families don't have a computer at home, uh, if that's any deterrent to the kids not learning.  I mean, they -- they have it at school but they can't do their homework with it and --
R:  Well, it's in a limited time as well.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  That's a good point, that -- that probably does have something to do with it.  I mean --
L:  Yeah, because I -- I've -- see some of the kids -- pictures that some of the kids, uh, using the computers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I often think to myself, "Well, do they go home?  What do they -- what can they do at home at -- if -- if they don't have a computer at home?"
R:  Yeah, because [COUGH] especially with the economy now you know, you -- it -- it's hard to, um -- today but they -- they have acc- -- they have access, some -- some kids get to stay after school or if they're lucky they get to stay after school, they use them.
L:  Oh, I re- --
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Or they can go to the library but hopefully they -- they have the access to stay after school to use those to, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they can stay on track and use one computer and get used to it and, uh, expand their minds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah, uh, I have noticed when I go down to our library, we have -- I'm a -- I'm in a small town and we have, I guess, about five computers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- used for public use and it's amazing the kids that are using down there.  I'm just -- it's just -- I know that they aren't doing it for school, they're doing it for entertainment. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  It's not that I see what they're, uh, looking up but, uh, I just know that they -- they're -- um, the library is providing entertainment for 'em just like might as well -- like a book or something.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, we --
L:  Some --
R:  We have a standing, um -- we have a standing trip to the library every third Saturday just to go down there to play on the computers --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because they have games that are set up and stuff like that so --
L:  Oh, gee that's good.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah, so ... well, occasionally I see adults playing solitaire on it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do that, too.  I do that, too.
L:  Well, darn it, I can't. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I really en- -- yeah, I really do enjoy that so --
R:  But again, like I said, if, you know -- I'm -- if they have to, I know a lot of people don't like the -- the idea of raising taxes or millages because of that but I thought well, you know, if -- if they're taking our teachers away from us, we still have to provide an education for our children --
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  -- and if -- if we have to do that through computers then if -- if that -- if that's the absolute necessary thing that they have to do I'm -- I'm all for it, whatever it does -- whatever it takes to keep my kids interested in school, to keep 'em on the computers because not only that it builds their skills for later -- for later in life because everything you do now, jobwise, takes the skill of -- of a computer of some sort.
L:  Yeah, even -- eve -- even the -- the, uh, secretaries and accountants and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Use 'em, you just have to know how to -- the only thing I wonder about is they change.  I mean, they have the -- they don't change 'em, they update 'em and they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- improve 'em --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um, I don't know how people learn 'em that fast.  It took me so long to learn the one I have. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, the basics are still the same.  It's just, you know, the speed is faster, um, and you do have extra things that you can do but it's not something you necessarily have to do.  It's -- basically, a lot of it has to do with -- do, with just the speed as far as upgrading --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, in the, um [LIPSMACK] um, uh, the file space but, um, you know, even kids now days that even work in fast food restaurants --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they're working with some type of a computer --
L:  Yeah, you're right -- 
R:  -- so ...
L:  -- come to think of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I -- I don't know how they -- [LAUGH] I just don't know how the world's working nowadays. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know, I know, but somebody would have to put up -- they would have to give me a big, long, lengthy discussion if -- if they were against it because I would re- -- I would really -- I think I could, uh, put up a pretty good fight as to -- if they said, "No, I don't think so" --
L:  I --
R:  -- you know.
L:  I can't imagine why anybody would be against it.
R:  No, I'm sure -- but I'm sure there's some -- there are some people, you know --
L:  [SIGH] Well, I sup- --
R:  -- that maybe don't have the computers or don't understand them or maybe they've never seen kids in school learning from them and see what they're capable of.
L:  Yeah, the only reason of why I could think of was that would -- it costs money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they would be against it because, uh, it would cost them more taxes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I can't --
R:  But I understand, I mean, I -- I do -- I do see their point because not everybody's made of money.
L:  Yeah, so, well [SIGH] --
R:  But, I mean, I understand but it -- if -- if they had kids in school or if they're -- if they are following their kids' education at all, any, all they have to do is walk in that classroom and -- and just see the en- -- number one, the enjoyment, number two, the skill, and, uh, that their children are see -- uh, their children are getting and it's -- it's a great ego booster as well.
L:  Well, now they don't use the, uh, computer for every subject, do they?
R:  Um, no, um, I don't th- -- I don't believe so, they could but, no --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think they just have, um --
L:  The reason why I wonder is because they could do away with teachers. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, but then again, you know, they -- they do need to learn the face to face interacting, you know, with -- with adults and I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's good for them as well.
L:  Yeah.  There's some questions that a computer can't answer, I'm sure --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- so you have to have a teacher there.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, so ...
