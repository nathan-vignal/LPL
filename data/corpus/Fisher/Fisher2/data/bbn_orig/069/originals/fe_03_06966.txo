R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Um, I'm Cathy from Cleveland.
R:  I'm Jennifer.  I'm from Wisconsin.
L:  Wisconsin?  Oh.
R:  Yeah, from [inaudible] Green Bay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] The Green Bay Packers, huh?
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L: [MN]
R:  -- that's all I ever get to hear about here. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, you know they just said before it was education and then they elaborated a little +bit -- bit more about, um, computers --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in, um, education, help or harm it, and, um, I think probably they help it more than they would harm it.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, you know, helping kids learn, um, because they can do so much and you can look up so much more and look it up much faster and that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, as long as you don't spend all your time on the computer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I'm sure they don't in the classroom.  I don't have much, um, experience with how much they actually use it in the classroom.  Do you?
R:  Um, well, I was in the big -- first time I got to deal with computers I was -- I'm twenty eight right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- almost twenty nine but they had computers, really basic, +primitive, uh, computers back in, uh, probably when I was in eighth grade but I don't have experience today.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, my child's not old enough yet --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but as -- from what I know, um, I guess it's -- it's a big part of their learning these days.
L:  Mm.
R:  They have access to the internet and everything during their -- their study halls and -- and all their, uh, library time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, yeah, I definitely agree with you that it does help.  It --
L:  Yeah.
R:  They have so much information these days and kids are -- have so much available at their fingertips.
L:  Right.
R:  It's not like back [LAUGH] when I was a kid.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You had to look things up in an encyclopedia --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And [MN] --
R:  -- and -- and the information was always outdated in those, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you had to buy a new one each couple years.
L:  Right, yeah, um --
R:  It definitely helps.
L:  -- we have, um, cable modem, uh, for our internet so it's much faster and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not sure how many schools have the cable because, um, you know, if you have, say for the grade school, just eight -- just say eight grades --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if, just on the outside chance say you'd have five computers in the classroom --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that's forty and, um, then if you put in, um, kindergarten that's forty five.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I don't know how they could do it that the kids --
R:  I --
L:  Kids'll be able to look it up fairly fast and that.
R:  Mm.  I do think they do have broadband.  I don't know how -- because the -- the administration area would have to have that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- any business these days, I would think, would have the high speed internet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would think so, I --
L:  Yeah, it, um --
R:  I can't imagine them waiting for kids to download things [LAUGH] on the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  On the old internet. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  It would take forever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, I --
R:  But I do think some kids do overdue the internet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and computer.  That's why Americans are getting so [LAUGH] overweight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All those little kids are twice the size of the kids [LAUGH] when I was a kid.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- but there's a limit to everything, every -- anything in excess is bad.
L:  Mm, right.  Yeah, I think they probably limit the time --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- um, because each one wouldn't have -- wouldn't be able to do it at the same time.
R:  No.
L:  Most schools can't afford it so they'd have to limit it to either free time or look up a, um -- for a report or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and
R:  But most people do have it in their homes these days --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and kids do use that for education also.
L:  Right.  And, um, the -- the key is blocking, um -- how do the schools or the libraries block for kids inappropriate sites?
R:  Oh, they -- they do have programs for that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  And --
R:  -- there's controversy about what should be blocked and what shouldn't because some of them block medical information.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know in libraries that that is an issue, um, as far as looking up things such as breast cancer and things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A lot of times it's -- they can't access that information, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- due to the fact that that was put on there.
L:  Right.
R:  So there is definite controversy with that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I think that the -- the people -- the teachers and the librarians that are watching over these computers really [LAUGH] have to watch the kids like a hawk --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and just make sure that they're being -- staying within certain guidelines.
L:  Mhm.  And it -- you know, they have enough to do as it is, let alone trying to see what the kids are accessing or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  I guess it depends on what the activity is, if they all do that at the same time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or if they -- they have kids sharing a computer then the teacher would have access to walk around and look at all the -- the screens.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I was thinking more the library --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, um --
R:  -- that's true.
L:  Um, it would be a little bit tough, I think, for them to have to, um, check [SIGH] and see what everyone is doing.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I know my -- my aunt is a librarian and she -- she talks about this every once in a while.  She had a kid print off thousands of pictures of hamsters --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- on the computer, [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The kid just loved hamsters.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, uh, she didn't realize it until there was a big huge stack of hamster pictures [LAUGH] at the computer. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think this kid had a learning disability so that's why they got this idea in their head but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Well, better hamsters than something else. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true.  But, yeah, they -- they can't watch 'em every minute. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  And it's amazing what the youngsters in, like, kindergarten are learning and know how to do --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on the computer.
R:  Definitely, definitely.  It's amazing what they -- they know more about computers than many adults do.
L:  Right.
R:  They can go in and fix a -- a problem like nothing.
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  But I wouldn't -- I have no clue how to fix problems [LAUGH] with the computer.
L:  No. [LAUGH]
R:  I work on it all day but I don't know how [LAUGH] to do all the programming stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.  It's, um -- thank heavens for your, um, tech people, right?
R:  Definitely and that's what a lot of kids are getting into these days.  They enjoy learning the -- the electronics part of the computer.
L:  Mhm.  I have a son in law who, um -- I don't know exactly what he does on the computer but he -- he does, um -- he works all day and so at night, if I have a problem, he [LAUGH] doesn't like to hear problems too often.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I have to, um, um, space them out, not ask him too many --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- prob- -- questions about computers.
R:  That's hard though.
L:  Oh, it --
R:  It's hard not to. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  And --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that, um -- you know, with so many jobs going to Mexico or South America --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or China, I think probably more are going to have to get into the computer and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, either fixing or programming or, you know, something like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, um, so many of the manufacturing jobs are leaving.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, it's definitely more of a service industry these days.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everything involves PCs, computers of some sort.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't think there's many jobs out there that don't.
L:  No.
R:  Very few.
L:  Yeah, I, um, uh -- probably even ditch digging has, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Needs a computer [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- to tell it where to dig. [LAUGH]
R:  -- they have to figure out which ditches to dig tomorrow. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they -- they --
R:  Yeah, there's very few.  I can't think of anything offhand that -- that you wouldn't need a computer for these days --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- whether it's a little portable unit or -- or a mainframe.
L:  Right, and, um [MN] even, uh, so many of the machines that they use to dig the ditches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, you know, survey or whatever, um, deal with computers or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- rely on computers for different things.
R:  Definitely.  So it is a good thing that they're including it in education, [LAUGH] I guess.
L:  Right. 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, that's the -- the wave of the future, they keep saying.
R:  Mhm, yeah, definitely.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I --
R:  Long ten minutes. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it --
R:  Only have so much to say about that topic. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it, um -- you know, if you -- if they gave you five minutes then you'd think, "Oh gee, I could have talked for ten" but ten minutes [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's like, "Ah ..." [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think it depends on the topic.
L:  Right.
R:  Some topics you -- I mean, if you both agree, I mean [LAUGH] there's not much more to say.
L:  Yeah.  I had, um -- I had one, um, where we -- we did, um -- we did talk the full ten minutes on it, I can't remember which one that was, and, um -- and then the other one we couldn't quite fill the full ten. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  This is my second.  The first one, uh, we filled pretty good.  It was on terrorism so --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- there was a lot more to say.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the other person was from DC so that was fascinating.
L:  Oh, yeah.
