R:  Hi, I'm Gretchen.
L:  Hi, I'm Jill.
R:  I'm sorry, what's your name.
L:  Jill.
R:  Jill.  Oh, okay, hi Jill [LAUGH].  I'm calling from Florida.
L:  Oh, that's cool.  I'm in California.
R:  California, I'm looking at ah moving over there.
L:    Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Oh, wow.  Um, did you happen to hear clearly what the topic we're supposed to be -- I didn't catch the very end of it.
L:  No, I -- I just got the something about ah country being a threat to the United States, but I didn't hear the specific part of it.
R:  Yeah, I -- I f- -- I -- I heard about the ah the co- -- which countries do we think are a threat to something blah, blah, blah [LAUGH] I thought --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  I thought, oh gosh, I hope the other person knows what this is about.  Well, as for countries being a threat to us, um, that could be um any [LAUGH].  I don't --
L:  I suppose.  I mean, I don't -- I don't know.  Ah I'm a bit of a cynic, I guess, but um I don't really see any specific country as being a threat to us right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I don't know how you feel about that, but ...?
R:  Oh no, go ahead.  Um, I've -- I don't keep up with, you know, what's going on in the world, like I'm supposed to, so, you know, any -- any opinions that you have could be only an education for me, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah [LAUGH]. I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- totally serious, I don't keep up on the news or anything.  All I pay attention to is the big headline stuff that my mom tells me, "Oh did you hear about the doctor germ, that lady who did this and that?" I'm like, "No" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she's like -- she's like, "Gretchen, you've got to keep up on this stuff", I'm like, "Mom, there's just too much stuff to keep up on" --
L:  That's true.
R:  So, I just, you know, I --
L:  Really true.
R:  Well I -- I actually the most interesting thing I saw in the news just the other day was this man in Iraq who so badly did not want to live under the regime of um of what's his name over there, Saddam Hussein, that he -- he actually dug a hole under his bedroom and lived in there for like twenty one years or something.
L:  Oh my god.
R:  Yeah, it was so heartbreaking --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- when you know the news showed him coming out and -- and he only had three little holes in the wall where he could -- where he could see what was going on in the outside world.
L:  How did he get food and such?
R:  His mother.  His mother brought it down to him and there was no trace of him being alive in the house anywhere, so when, you know, when he was supposed to be either killed or called to duty or whatever, they couldn't find him.  And so --
L:  Wow [LAUGH].
R:  -- he was just staying hiding down there until, you know, until um Hussein was supposed to not be, you know, in his reign anymore and when he heard about the fall of Hussein, you know, when the statue and all came down and stuff, he -- that's when he came out.
L:  That's so intense.
R:  It -- it really was.  It was so, so powerful to see that and to know that somebody could be that strong willed that he's, you know, he's going to stand up for his own life and -- and refuse to live under somebody's regime that he doesn't agree with.  And he -- the -- the room was only like a meter wide and it was so many meters long or whatever and it was just so sad.  He had one little lantern and a little radio that he could keep, you know, keep tabs on what was going on in the outside world and his mom brought food down to him.  And that was it.  So, sad.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  But I -- I don't -- I don't know about whatever countries -- I know we're supposed to stay on the topic, but um --
L:  Right [LAUGH].
R:  I [LAUGH] I don't really since -- since neither one of us really heard the end of that little recording, I'm not really sure what we're supposed to stay on topic about.  I don't -- I pers- personally don't know what -- what country or countries I could say that I consider to be a threat um except I guess it's only bec- my opinion is only because of, you know, all the news and all the war and all the stuff that -- that's been going on in the world, but that whole Middle East, you know, Middle Eastern area, the whole Saudi Arabia, Iraq, you know, that whole --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- area, that's -- that's the only thing I can think of that would be an actual threat.  Because that's -- that's all you hear about, that's where all the so called bad stuff is going on, all the war and all the fighting and all the terrorism --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But I mean who's to say that they're not equally terrified of us?
L:  Exactly.
R:  That -- that they're not --
L:  And I'm not sure that it -- it's any of the states over there that are actually planning anything against us, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, to me it seems like it's more this group or groups maybe, like Al Qaeda --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who are organizing terrorist networks, but rather I mean I can't see, you know, Jordan pulling off a war against us or us doing anything that would like even remotely damage us.
R:  Or be like any kind of threat or anything.
L:  Yeah.  And I mean, I don't see them wanting to.  I -- I can't -- we are such a threat to everybody there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that any nation as a whole would be really um, stupid, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to try and provoke us, you know.
R:  I didn't even realize that our country was as strong as it is until the whole shock and awe ordeal that we saw with this recent war and when -- when I saw that on television, the whole -- when I was watching the shock and awe --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was -- I literally was standing there in shock and awe and I was like, "Mom, I cannot believe this" she goes, "That's exactly why it's called shock and awe" because you just stand there in shock and awe, you can't believe what you're seeing.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I stood there with --
L:  I didn't see any of it, --
R:  -- goosebumps.
L:  -- because I just, um, I don't have a TV.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I just get my news by ah like radio and stuff.
R:  It was unbelievable to see.  It looked like fireworks in the sky in Baghdad.
L:  Wow.
R:  It was so just scary.  And so just h- I don't -- I don't even have a word.  It was -- it was unbelievable and I'm actually very grateful that my Dad didn't live to see all this because I know he's rolling in his grave right now just knowing of all the sadness that's -- that's happened since September eleventh.  He was alive to see that.  And he ah he lived a few months later than that and I'm just so glad that he didn't have to live to see this war, but he -- he knew something was coming.  He kept warning me --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- he kept saying, you know, "You have to watch the news, keep up on what's going on because there's potentially a World War Three coming up, you've got to pay attention and be ready for this" and I told him, "I just don't understand what's going on in the world, I want to understand but I don't.  It's too confusing".
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've lived a very sheltered life where everything was, you know, just little happy land, you know, just go to school and la di da di da and have my stomach filled and, you know, everything was fine.  And I didn't have anything to worry about.  Being in the Western world as we are, we have -- I really consider that we have not all too much to worry about, whereas people in that portion of the planet over there, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where they've got to worry about hitting camels with their cars and stuff or they'll go to jail, you know, and women have to wear veils and not even have their eyes be seen in public, you know, that's the -- that's the area of the world that's really got to be careful, you know, with every breath they take and that's -- that's just terrifying that there are people living like that, under that kind of regime and that kind of government and it's just sad.
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  We're so fortunate.
L:  I'm no -- I -- I wouldn't give up what I have for a second, but I'm not sure that people who grow up there are so upset with the way they live.
R:  No, that's true.  That's true.  I agree with you.  E- [MN] and I assume that you believe that because they're used to it, right?
L:  Or that they have belief systems that make what they do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- absolutely okay.
R:  Yeah, yeah, acceptable and --
L:  And I'm not saying -- I'm not talking about the abuse of like, you know, stoning women to death --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like wearing a veil and stuff, some women really believe that that's the way they should be and um you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- part of it is being used to it and part of it is --
R:  Their culture.
L:  -- yeah, exactly.
R:  Right.  Yeah, that I -- I see your point on that.  Yeah.  Um, yeah, but no, the stoning people to death and all that, that's yeah, I -- I don't see that as being widely --
L:  I find -- 
R:  -- acceptable.
L:  -- I find it hard to ah support that [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in any way.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  No matter what culture you're from, that just sounds really cruel and unfair.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, it's like whipping somebody to death, or you know, oh, yuck.  I just can't believe this kind of torture goes on in the world.  S- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's so sad to be a part of it and to hear about it and it just makes me really grateful to live where I live.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Even though I --
L:  And I wouldn't give it up, you know.
R:  No.  Even though I don't understand a hill of beans about what's going on around me, I thank God so much that there are brilliant people working in this country that do understand everything that's going and can protect those of us who don't understand and those of us who do understand.  And I also thank God for my mom who keeps up on all this stuff, she keeps up on the smart, smart people stuff on TV and all that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and tells me about it, you know, she's my little personal newscaster, she like filters out everything that I need to know and tells me.
L:  Oh, great.  That's [LAUGH] --
R:  You know? [LAUGH] Dad was -- Dad was kind of like that for me, too, but um Mom just really makes it a big deal --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the house, "Oh, did you hear about blah, blah in the news", "Well, no, Mom, but I was waiting for you to tell me what happened in the news today" [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] "Gretchen, you've got to keep up on this."  I'm like, "Why, when I have you to keep me up on it?" [LAUGH].
