L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Felicia.
L:  I'm Valerie.
R:  Hi Valerie.  Nice to meet you.
L:  Me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm good.  Now our topic is computers in education, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  What do you -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what do you think?
L:  Um, I think for the most part they can be helpful.  I mean, I'm sort of biased 'cause I grew up using computers.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, you know, I find that they're, like, really useful in research and, um, all sorts of things really, just education.  But, at the same time if they're used for, like, only games, like [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, I guess it can be distracting with it too.  See I'm -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm obviously a little older.  Not much older but a little bit older than you.  So, I didn't have that when I was growing up but I use it extensively now at work and what not and I do agree that for research purposes and there's so much knowledge available to you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's amazing.  But, on the other hand, I think, some people use it a lot as a crutch.  And -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what -- that's what scares me because I have a -- a little one who, you know, doesn't really think she needs to know how to spell because she could do Spell check.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know?
L:  I never thought of it like that, yeah.
R:  And -- or maths is not that important 'cause she'll just use Excel spreadsheet and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it'll calculate for her.  You know -- 
L:  Oh, she's quick.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Which I guess, you know, in -- in the long run, I mean, if you carry your PVA with you and whatnot, you can do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, if you're shopping and you know, you -- did they give me the right change, and you don't know how to add.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That could be bad.
L:  It's true, like, if you can hold computers back until you learn basic skills -- 
R:  Exactly, and I agree with -- 
L:  -- then -- 
R:  -- you on that.  Yeah, it's -- 
L:  -- then they're really helpful.
R:  But, a lot of the teachers are not [NOISE] -- I -- yeah, I'm sure it's not the teachers that are making the decision but a lot of them are allowing children to use -- and calculators are not computers but I guess a basic -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- form of computer, they're using them in the very low grades now.
L:  Really?
R:  For multiplication and you know, and I -- I think you're right.  I think you made a good point that -- 
L:  It's -- 
R:  -- you know, until the basic skills are learned, maybe that shouldn't be introduced.
L:  Mhm.  You know, it's like, um, like researchers, like, if you're doing, like, college level research, the computers are really helpful but at the same time it's, like, sometimes you just need to go to the library.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, you don't feel like doing that 'cause you can do, like, most of it from home now.  It's so -- 
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  -- so quick.
R:  And that's great, I have to say, and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think we're so used to it.  I know recently my daughter had a project to do and unfortunately we had a hard drive crash -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and you know, we didn't have the resources available to us at ten o'clock at night, you know, 'cause --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the library was closed.  We were like, "Oh, my God.  What do we do?"
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  You know?  It -- 'cause you -- you do.  You depend on it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah -- 
L:  But, at the same time, I mean, it's like [inaudible] ten o'clock the night before, you know --  
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  -- sort of like [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] -- but, I guess people do that all the time -- 
R:  Yeah, whether or not -- yeah.
L:  -- like that's happened [several inaudible words].  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I think you're right about that.  But, then -- 
L:  At least you can, like, save yourself if it's ten --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- o'clock at night and you have a computer.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, right.  You're not -- you're not lost.  You're not having a brain hemorrhage because you do have some [LAUGH] information you can get.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah, no, I think -- I think they're great.  I think it -- it can be frustrating though.  Sometimes I know when we do research on the computer --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sometimes if the research isn't [MN] I guess fine tuned enough you can wind up with four hundred thousand hits -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for a particular, you know, word that you're searching and before you actually find something that's pertinent to what you're looking for, you could spend about [LAUGH] twelve hours -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- going through.  I don't know if you've ever encountered that.
L:  Or even like, um, like a whole lot of stuff on journal articles and like -- like journals with r- researching for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a paper and you'll pull something up and it's, like, oh, this is great.  There's so many different things but it takes for ever to go through everything.
R:  Yes.  Yes -- 
L:  You know, it'd --
R:  -- it's true.
L:  -- be much [several inaudible words] pull it up [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than go to the library and pull 'em out and like page through it.
R:  Right.  The old way.  Yeah, the mic- microfiche or [LAUGH] else those other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ones that we used to do.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I think it's good [several inaudible words], it's amazing with the speed that -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, technology has increased over the past -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- couple of years.  I mean -- 
L:  So, you don't have to waste so much time waiting for everything to load and that --
R:  It's true.
L:  -- sort of -- 
R:  And -- and now too, if you don't have, like, cable modem or something, if you have a phone line you're, like, way out dated.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, that's so terrible.  I haven't --  
R:  Yet it's a shame.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  It's a shame.  And I feel bad, you know, for some of the kids in -- in my daughter's grade whose parents maybe can't afford a computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're at -- they really are at a disadvantage 'cause the teachers -- 
L:  It's like -- 
R:  -- are requiring --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- certain things be researched that way or -- or, you know, brought in on a disk or a CD -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, to hand in which, I think, is unfortunate.
L:  It's -- it's unfair, you know.  Like, ah, you should have -- ah, we talked about that, ah, yesterday, the option of training things in that way.  But there needs to be a way for -- for kids who can't -- 
R:  Right.  To have access elsewhere -- 
L:  -- who don't have that access to it.
R:  -- or something.  I -- 
L:  'Cause then they have like a step above all the other kids, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause they -- they don't have that, like, luxury of -- of doing the work late at night and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- they have to do it at certain hours and -- 
R:  And it -- and it's hard too because a lot of them -- you know, it's the whole status thing as well where they have to have all the good clothes and all of this and if they don't have a computer, you know, it's embarrassing, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause it's kind of -- that's a shame. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah -- 
L:  It's almost worse.  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or younger.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] So, but for the most part, I -- 
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- mean, I -- I happen to use computers to the inth degree because I -- I telecommute.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I work from home.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And, ah, which is a great opportunity and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, because of the internet.  You know, all of our computer, ah, software in the office is based on the internet -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so any of us can access it anywhere that we are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't have to commute every day.  You know, so that's -- that's excellent.
L:  Yeah, that's really convenient.
R:  Yeah.  That -- that's really good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, I never thought I'd be in that kind of a -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- situation [LAUGH] 'cause I know when I -- when word processing was first came out I was like, "Oh, my God.  How am I going to do this?  I use the calculator, I use the t- -- the typewriter".  So, now -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I've learnt not to be as resistant to change even though sometimes it's not easy to, ah, invest the time to learn.
L:  Mhm.  But it -- well, it -- it seems -- it's like so overwhelming there's so much you -- you can learn -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- with computers but I don't know.
R:  And then when they -- 
L:  I think, like -- 
R:  -- crash then you're in the big -- in big trouble.
L:  Y- yeah.  Well, then you learn how to fix 'em.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  You're right.  Exactly.  'Cause you have to.  You're desperate.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  But it -- I -- I, ah -- like, my computer distracts me more than anything else.  [LAUGH] I come home from work and it's the first thing I sit in front of and it's like the TV.
R:  And you have to check your email and -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah, I know -- 
L:  I -- I have to --
R:  -- it -- 
L:  -- check it like ten times.  [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.  It's true.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] "Did I get anything new yet?"
R:  It's true.  And then if you [NOISE] belong to any email newsletters -- 
L:  Mhm.  Oh, ah -- 
R:  -- you know, when you get them you feel compelled that you have to read them and that's -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- time consuming and most times they're a bunch of nothing.  [LAUGH] But, you're -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm always -- I'm always, like, oh, that one that I don't read is going to be very important.
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, um -- 
L:  Exactly.  But, at the same time it's, like, such a great -- like I'm on some, like, [several inaudible words] and -- and get newsletters from things like from -- a bunch of stuff from Brazil that I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- interested in.  It's like, it's so just amazing that --
R:  It's amazing.  Exactly.  You would never have that resource.
L:  -- I have that -- that opportunity to read about it.
R:  Absolutely and I know a lot of, um -- I have family that's not close by and they can send their pictures digitally to us and you know, new born babies you can see almost instantly.  It's very -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- cool.  It's very -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- cool.
L:  Yeah.  I'm just reading -- ah, like the other thing for me is, like, you can read all sorts of different news and things that you -- like, instead of turning on the TV, like, you can go -- like a better spectrum of what's going --
R:  Mhm.  And you can -- 
L:  -- on.  Like -- 
R:  -- tailor it to what interests you as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're not stuck with all the, ah, National Enquirer news, unless you want to -- 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- read it, you know?  Well, sometimes it's fun -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to read, I have to admit.  But -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, if you don't have the time you can actually just zero in on what's important to you.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, I think a lot of times too there's, like, overload of information.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, especially with the war that just happened.  I think we kind of knew too much of what was going on.  I -- 
L:  Yeah, well -- 
R:  -- know my husband -- my husband was glued to CNN and we were w- watching the war like it was a movie.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is kind of weird.
L:  Yeah.  But, at the same time I felt like there were certain things I didn't -- like, I didn't feel were being publicized well enough that were happening --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Sure. 
L:  -- and that there were ways to, like, go on [several inaudible words].  Like, in some ways it's fortunate that you can go on line and find out and other ways it's like, it should be on TV, you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- certain things that are -- that are happening ar- around the rest of the world and responses and -- 
R:  Well, I think -- I think the -- it's used to the -- the government's benefit as well 'cause it's another form of, I don't know, a mode of propaganda that they can use.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they -- they know what they can, you know, put out on a mass mailing list or on -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, website banners.  Ah, you know, I don't know.  It -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- get's kind of scary.  And -- 
L:  Well, ah -- 
R:  -- even some of the things they were using.  Um, they were sending -- bombarding, ah, some of the Iraqi people with emails.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like trying to, like, [LAUGH] brainwash them through emails.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was like, "Wow" you know?  Things you don't even think of.
L:  Mhm.  No, there's a lot -- ah, I don't know, I felt like there was a lot going on that, whether it be true or not, it still wasn't publicized and -- 
R:  It was selective.  Selective information -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but a lot -- 
L:  I mean -- 
R:  -- but a lot of it -- a lot of selective and -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, at least, like, if you turn on the computer you have -- y- you can choose, you know, more than you can with the regular TV --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- I find.  You know, I've -- I mean, the few -- it's at least -- well, TV is like so -- I mean, well, ultimately they're only, like, s- -- I forget, a handful of corporations that own everything -- 
R:  Right.  Everything.  Exactly --  
L:  -- so, like [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so, like at -- 
R:  It's pretty much controlled.
L:  -- least with the internet if you search around and you know where to look then you can find, like, all sorts of different opinions and views and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's not so, like, homogeneous whereas I feel like I turn on the TV and every station's exactly the same --
R:  Mhm.  And that's -- 
L:  -- and they're like, "Oh" --   
R:  -- just exactly what --
L:  -- [MN] boring. 
R:   -- you said because they're owned by just a select few actually -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that wear different hats on different stations.  But, if you -- 
L:  Mhm.
