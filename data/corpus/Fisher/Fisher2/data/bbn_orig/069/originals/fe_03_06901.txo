L:  Hello.
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, I'm Carol.
R:  Hi, I'm Andrea.  What are we supposed to be talking about?
L:  [LAUGH] I believe we're supposed to be talking about um the Middle East and issues in the Middle East and --
R:  She said something about [inaudible] or somebody, but I didn't understand what she said, or what the recording.
L:  It -- it -- it was saying that do we believe that we sh- -- the United States should be in the peace process for the Middle East, or should we not be there?  Will there ever be peace in the Middle East?
R:  Oh, is that what the question's about?  Okay.  Okay.
L:  All right?
R:  So, this is nothing to do with Iraq, this is about just the Middle East peace process where things are like --
L:  Well, it could be -- it could be Iraq.  I mean, it -- you could, you know, you could think about that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because that would be in the Middle East, so --
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So, what do you think?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um I think we should be pulling out at this point.  I don't even think we should have been in there in the first place --
R:  Yeah, I have to agree with that.  I -- well, I think -- I'm not -- I don't personally understand why we are so involved in the process, particularly on the said of Israel and um the -- I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not sure I understand why we're so involved in that.  I don't think I'd like -- like I don't -- I don't -- like, I don't agree with people that say, "Oh, well, you know, well, you're" um what's the word, was is it?  Anti Jewish or something if you don't you know support Israel.  Because I'm not anti Jewish, but I don't know that I think that I like everything they're doing and I'm not sure why the United States is so solidly behind them all the time.
L:  I don't think it's so much um just Israel and Iraq, it's -- it's the bigger picture of when there -- there's a country and they're being um ruled or they're being let's say um persecuted by people that are in power, people that have um the means, the money --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or the --
R:  But see, that's Israel.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  That's Israel.  Israel is the one who's in power, they're they ones oppressing and persecuting the Palestinians, that's why they're suicide bombing, because they have nothing else to do because the Israelites are the ones in power.  They're the ones that are oppressing them.  They run the country because it was given to them after the second World War --
L:  I don't think they've --
R:  -- and the Palestinians, some of them still happen to live there because it was their country first and they were living there and Israel came in and they were given that piece of c- -- that land and so they're the ones that are in control, but they are the ones doing the oppressing.  That's why I don't understand why we're so very supportive of them, because I don't know that I think the way they treat the Palestinians is fair.  Granted, I feel like it's a good reaction, considering that they're suicide bombing and killing innocent people --
L:  Why don't you -- why don't you --
R:  -- but --
L:  -- why don't you think they -- what they do -- the Pal- -- what do they do to the Palestinians that you think isn't -- isn't fair?
R:  Fir- -- first of all, they're treated like second class citizens because they're Gentile and not Jewish.  They are pers- -- especially now, under, you know, under very strict control as far as travel is concerned, in towns, they have curfews, and I understand that somew- -- that somewhat of these things are meant to be like you said -- like I said, a reaction to the fact that suicide bombers are killing innocent people, but the treatment of the Palestinians has not been the most fair.  Like I said, they're treated like second class citizens and they were first, it was their country before it was given to the -- to the -- to the Jewish people.  And so I think that it's just a little bit unfair.  [PAUSE]
L:  In terms of because we're -- we're behind them?
R:  Yes.
L:  But I -- it -- it -- it goes back to -- to a bigger picture of oppression and the Jewish people being persecuted and not having a homeland.  [inaudible] I just did a whole thesis on all of this, not -- not so much Israel, um, you know, Israel and what's going on there, but what went back on to World War Two --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and how they were pu- -- persecuted and the -- way back into even biblical times.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's wha- -- and -- and then getting the land, all right, that had to go back to the fact that they were given that -- that was taken from you know, many, many years ago so they would have h- -- you know, some homeland, something to call their own.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, in -- in that sense, but um as far as all -- all the things going on there, they just, I mean they don't go out and they're not killing that way, I mean, they -- they don't -- they're not massacring people, they were never -- they are doing, they're fighting back, they're doing it in self defence, but --
R:  But I guess --
L:  -- but what -- when you -- what they're doing is just m- -- I mean, e- -- I mean, the -- the bigger picture, I mean it's just like, you know, well, what happened here with the World Trade Center, I'm right by the World Trade Center, all right.  We saw the smoke that day.  Yeah, so it -- it goes into the -- that -- that -- that bigger picture of fighting and you know ruling and doing things that um you know to -- to be in that kind of power, or an absolute power.
R:  Well, see, I guess I like -- okay, if we -- like -- like you said, if you go back to the history, the ah Jewish people were according to b- -- you know, according to biblical history, given this land by God and they were told, well we c- -- you know, to basically kill and destroy all the people who live there now because I'm giving you this land.  So, again, they were there first.  Then, they were oppressed and you know and persecuted and during the World War Two by the Germans, not the people in the Middle East at that point, and the rest -- and the world decided that they were just going to randomly take some of the land belonging to the Palestinians and give it to the Jewish people for a homeland.  And to me I don't under- -- like I'm like, where did we get the right to decide that we were going to take some of their country and give it to them?  We didn't take some of our country and give it to the Jewish people.  We took some of theirs.  
L:  [MN]
R:  And the Jewish people came in and said, "You're second class citizens" in the country they were living in before the Jewish people got there.
L:  Well, they were there.  They were there, they were driven out.  They -- they were there.  They were there in parts and they were d- driven out because a lot of -- of the um historical um places that -- that they worship in that they -- that was before Christ --
R:  Yes, but --
L:  -- I'm just saying [LAUGH] they were there before --
R:  -- but the -- but the thing -- in the Old Testament, God -- the only reason they were there was because God said, God told Moses and the Israelites, when they left Egypt, "I am going to give you this country, kill the people that are there now" and then they got into trouble because they didn't kill them all and they started idol worshiping and everything.  But they were not there first.  God told them to go back there and kill those people, "I'm giving you this land of milk and honey".  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I'm not so sure that they told to go kill anybody there [MN].
R:  Yes, God said, "Destroy them all".  That was exactly what God told them to do.  And they didn't and that was where they got into problems.
L:  Do you r- -- do you -- do you read --
R:  God said to destroy all those people.  I can go get my Bible and read it.  But I know it's there.  God told them to destroy all the people that and like the [inaudible], Canaanites, all of them.  God told them to destroy them.  They didn't, they made treaties with some of them, they started you know intermarrying with them, that's where they started getting into all their problems.  But God told them to -- to destroy those people off that land, "Because I'm giving it to you".
L:  So, you don't think we should be there, either?  You don't think we should be in the Middle East either?
R:  I don't -- I don't think -- I think -- I think that yes we should um -- um, you know, but it would be in the interest of the world and in the humanitarian interest to try to help them find peace.  What I dislike is the fact that I feel that we are acting extremely partisan and very much in favor of Israel and I don't understand why we're so much in favor of Israel because I don't think that Israel -- I think that there's a lot going on there that the Jewish people are no- -- are doing wrong and I don't understand why we're so gung ho in favor of them because I'm like ah wait a minute, I -- it looks to me like -- and to be honest, I feel like at one point in time they called the people who were fighting a revolutionary war, they c- -- they um the J- -- the English, we would have called them terrorist and so to me, the Palestinians are fighting back and I think it's right, because they're killing innocent people, but they're fighting back the only way they can because they're not the ones in power and so Israel, okay, yes, well they're, you know, they're fighting ah is, you know, military because but that's only because they're the ones in power, so they can bring out the military and they look right and the other people have to be terrorist, but I don't know if I think it's that simple.  And the -- like I said, b- -- when you have -- they are fighting the only way they know how.  And I'm not --
L:  So, do you think they're --
R:  -- saying it's right.  But I feel like we are too partisan, a bit too in favor of Israel and I don't know if I agree with that.
L:  So, do you think --
R:  -- I think that we definitely do need to help and negotiate a peace, but I think we need to be more neutral.
L:  So, do you think there'll ever be peace there?
R:  No, I don't, because I think that part of it -- like the history -- part of that history is that at one point in time the
