L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where are you?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm in Honolulu --
L:  [SIGH] Oh my heavens.
R:  -- and my name is Regina. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, Regina, my name is Bev and [LAUGH] I'm in South Georgia, just, uh, above the Florida border --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- so we have got quite a distance today. [LAUGH]
R:  Couldn't get much further apart. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  Okay, all they told me when I clicked that I would participate was that the topic was education and now I've just heard that it's computers in education.
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay. 
R:  That's what I heard as well.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  Are -- are you affiliated with education?
L:  Yes, I'm a teacher.
R:  In what grade?
L:  I teach what's called adapted physical education.  I work with special needs children and I take them to PE.
R:  Oh.
L:  And my husband is a teacher and he teaches auto mechanics at high school.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How about you?
R:  I'm a college counselor.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, so --
R:  So, we're educators. [LAUGH]
L:  And my best friend is a technology teacher in an elementary school so [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh my, so --
L:  -- I guess this is a good subject for me. [LAUGH]
R:  I suppose. [LAUGH] Well, do you use computers at all in your work?
L:  I use computers, I personally use computers but in my part of the -- of what I do it's almost impossible to use a computer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I'm -- mine is an activity class --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and some [SIGH] -- some PE teachers do use computers to do, uh, fitness testing and have result -- you know, computer based results and things [SIGH] but what I do with special needs children is help them to fit into the regular PE class.
R:  I see.
L:  So it's almost impossible [NOISE] for me to use a computer because they don't use a computer in the class that I help them fit into. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And so --
R:  Well, computers have their uses and it's not everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's for sure. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I can tell you a very bad example of computers.  My son takes -- uh, was in sixth grade this year, he was in what's called accelerated math.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There's a computer program for math that was designed to be an enhancement program to help the children.  His teacher used it as the class, that's not --
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  So they basically taught themselves --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they took the computer tests and they -- and depending on how much they did on the computer, she got a report on how much they understood and I'm not sure that she ever actually taught a lesson --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that's my other degree field is math and I have taught math.  That's not my preferred field but that's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- my degree field [LAUGH] to get a job.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But [SIGH] I know that without ever teaching a lesson I can't imagine the children trying to teach themselves math.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's just some kids that aren't going to get it, how some are visual learners and some [LAUGH] -- you know, all different --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- type of learning style and they're not all going to be plug it in the computer --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you got it.
R:  Yeah, I -- yeah --
L:  So, that's a bad example I have of it but other than that ...
R:  Well, we certainly are [COUGH] entering the computer age and everybody needs to be able to use a computer but I have problems when the computers become the center.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Uh, the student needs to be the center --
L:  Right --
R:  -- uh --
L:  -- like in that -- that bad example where the computer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- teaches them and not the teacher.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I guess there are some people who might, depending on how good or poor the teacher is, uh, in some cases the computer might be a better teacher.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know [LAUGH] we have -- math is such a sticking point. [COUGH] I just finished counseling a student who is entering college in the fall and he scored at pre college math and he's got a lot of extra classes to take to get up to speed for math and it's because they're not learning it.  Um, so many of our college students are not learning it in school and I think part of that is because the teachers who are expected to teach it in elementary school, math isn't their thing and they really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't, um, do a good job at all, in fact they traumatize a lot of students, I'm afraid with math.  And then, as time goes on, math isn't a favorite subject for a lot of people so it kinda gets pushed aside --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and by the time they get to us --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's really tough, [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Well, I tell you --
R:  -- when they've missed all that stuff in the middle.
L:  -- I taught some high school math --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and our principal that -- when I was -- of course, that -- see, math is the field where you always get in.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You don't always get in in PE, I mean, you had to wait and transfer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when you have tenure.  So I've only -- I've taught many math classes as well, my husband being military we've been to some areas.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But anyway [SIGH] what happened when this principal came in and told us that the failure rate [NOISE] was too high --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for the ninth grade classes so he wanted us all to work on that and the teachers were asking, "Do you mean drop our standards?"  He said, "Do whatever it takes to get them to pass".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Drop your standards".  So the other teachers made up their own test.  Now I gave the book out for the test because I wanted to know what they knew.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If they don't understand it then I gave them the opportunity [NOISE] to come after school, learn with me and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and retake it.  However, [SIGH] that -- because once you get behind you're always behind.
R:  That's right.
L:  And I gave them a second book test and then I knew do they know the algebra.  The other teachers gave them [SIGH] a math -- watered down lots of questions from the first section, watered down test and I said, [NOISE] "You know, my students and my own personal children, are not going to get to take the watered down SAT test".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They're not going to say, "Excuse me, I need that test, uh, whatever you need to give me so I get a high SAT score --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- because that's the kind of math I took".  You know, that's --
R:  Unfortunately, that's happened in our state as well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at -- at the state level.
L:  I think it's happening nationwide --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and what's happening is teachers -- and another thing is teachers are being held accountable for their -- if their students pass or not so they're making them pass at whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Whatever it takes to pass --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but not meeting the standard --
R:  [SIGH] Well --
L:  -- and then when they go to college [LAUGH] they can't do it.
R:  Right.  One of the good things that some of the programs -- I know they've got math programs written on the computer that are progressive learning.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they give you a problem and if you don't get the right answer they give you another problem and they break it down until you get the right answer and then it moves on to the next level.  We're using that in some of our, um, areas in developmental math so that they can practise at their own pace --
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH] --and get it.  So that is a -- that's a benefit, I think, of -- of having -- if it's a good computer program to identify what the student doesn't know and give them extra work in that area.
L:  Right, now if that is --
R:  It relieves the teacher.
L:  -- their -- their only program, however [LAUGH] -- if the teacher's not teaching --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and supplementing, this is where I find a problem, then --
R:  It's --
L:  -- the kid who works at their own --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pace, by the end of the year may be six months behind --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- and that's where my child was, you know, they -- the teacher was letting them do their own thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] although -- and my child tested post high -- he's in sixth -- finished sixth grade and tested post high school math on the Stanford[?] nine test, he still scored -- his highest score in math was an eighty three because he didn't finish the number of problems she thought he ought to every day.
R:  Well, now --
L:  But he was -- he was okay with that 'cause he was working at his own pace, he wasn't told, "You need to do this, this and this".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He just did what he wanted to do.  Now, as I -- and as I said I have a real problem with that because I've got a child who's got a math talent who's not working to his potential.
R:  Yeah, he needs to be in a challenge class --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.
L:  So -- but, again, this is -- they think that this is the -- they got a big grant for all this accelerated math and you know what happens when you get a grant? [LAUGH]
R:  I do, I'm very familiar with that. [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now one -- some of our schools have a technology program for the children that they go to PE, music and technology --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the technology, I think that this -- those [NOISE] -- this is where technology needs to be right now for those children because they're learning how to use the computer with the right way to turn it on, turn it off, to -- you know, what shortcuts for this and how to program that.  They're learning a lot of things that they need to know that they can use in real life --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think that some of our schools have really caught on.  Now some of our schools haven't caught on yet [LAUGH] and they're just -- the teachers have to do everything and they -- from teaching them how to turn on the computer, you know, the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We've got a teacher who's doing that as a supplement then you can go ahead and teach with the computer instead of teaching the computer. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I think that we've got some schools here are doing -- you know, who've caught on to some good things with technology.
R:  Do you think most of your students have computers at home?
L:  I would bet they -- that [SIGH] over half --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- maybe two thirds.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now, how much the parents will let them use them, that's another story [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I think a good many of them have a computer.  As a matter of fact, if you see their science reports or their science fair projects, most of them are done -- are computer done.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I would say, uh, and a third of them are parent done but that's another story. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But mostly --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- there are very few that haven't been done on the computer and pasted to their science reports.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] So, again, I think that somebody's got access, whether it's the parents or the parents at work.  My own children, I have three, and two of them have their own computers that are hooked up online --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the other one doesn't because he used to share a room with it [NOISE] -- with one and he didn't need it. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now that we've moved he has his own room and he has access to the other two computers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I really think that a lot more kids have computer at home than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Than they -- but, again, the -- a lot of the parents do the part that, turn it on here, program it, take it to whatever they want them to do and then let -- let them go, so the kids -- 'cause they don't trust them.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE] They think they're going to mess up the computer and they'll program who knows what or download what. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that -- that's a reality, isn't it --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- download what. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, well, I had a child, my fourth grader, they downloaded that Bonsai Buddy thing --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which is a bad thing.  It's a little monkey that tells them jokes and all sort -- well, they thought that was a real good thing --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- but it -- it also sa- -- puts them on all sorts of email lists and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, being -- when they go to Nick and all that, those kind of sites, they sign up for -- they can put -- make a picture, put a nose in, put a fa- -- mouth in, put a face in it --
