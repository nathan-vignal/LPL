R:  Okay.  Oh, hello.  My name is Linda Patareski[?].
L:  Ah, Evan.
R:  Hello, Evan.
L:  How are ya doing?
R:  Um, okay.  So, I guess we're going to talk about education and computers?
L:  That's right.
R:  Good.  Okay.  Well, [LAUGH] computers, boy, I gotta -- I got something to say about that.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  What a bunch [LAUGH] -- what a bunch of hooey.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I think.  But, that's my opinion.  That's just an opinion.  Um, but I'm sure they do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have a good purpose in terms of educating the young people today.
L:  Ah, I'll -- I'll agree with that, being a college student myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think that educat- -- ah, you know, computers totally help, um, as -- I mean, just all -- you know, word processing alone.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it saves -- it saves, you know, plenty of time, I mean.  I'm -- I'm old enough to remember the typewriter days and --
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  Those were, you know, [MN] I can -- I can, you know, if I come up with extra ideas in my paper, I need to reedit it, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I can just turn it on and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- within a few minutes, change it and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  But as for --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- as for the Internet, though, I don't know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, that definitely has its pros and cons.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I mean, I just did a faux pax I guess, 'cause I guess we're only supposed to say my fir- first name but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- whatever, you know, like it's as if you can remember what [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, last name is, or -- or you care to.  But, anyway, um, the, um, yeah, you know, I mean, my grandson, he's learning to use the computer and he's only ten.  And he is ten but going on six because he's disabled so he goes to special ed, although in a regular school.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, ah, but I see where he's learning and I know the kids that are not disabled, ah, learn too --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how to use a computer at a very young age.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  So, ah, and -- and the kids, [SIGH] I ge- -- the children --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are the future, I mean, ah, but I also --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I mean, I wish it were [PAUSE] [SIGH] I wish it were kinda --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- simpler time myself, but, ah --
L:  Well, definitely, definitely.  I mean, I definitely agree, like, you know, and it almost goes along the lines of, like, ignorance is bliss, you know.  I mean, sure, we're all, like, ah, lead happier lives, you know, not knowing -- and, you know, when there's things not going on, but we also can't progress as a nation, you know, unless --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- we have these tools --
R:  Oh, well.
L:  -- to use.  
R:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, well, there again, that -- everything's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a matter of opinion, of course.  And, so, um, [SIGH] can we progress as we -- can we progress as a nation, boy, that's a real -- that's -- that's a toughie.  'Cause I don't know what that -- what it really means.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you know, in terms of progressing --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- as, um, George Bush would have us do, ah, mm, well, there are people that would like that and people that don't like it.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, and then, we're progressing as [PAUSE] [SIGH] as a -- and perhaps I would see a better progression if we lived in, um, zones.  I mean, if we have the eastern zone, the middle zone, midwest zone, and the, ah, western zone.
L:  Right.
R:  And just have different zones of areas and have 'em, like, you know, talk to one another but not necessarily, you know, I mean, I dunno, just -- it -- of course, I'm not in charge.  You know, I'm -- I'm really am not in charge.  I'm very small on the totem pole and so I don't really, um, have a say.  I don't -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] you know, that, so I'm just willing to let things be what they are and mostly try to just be the best person that I can be.  Which is to say, you know --
L:  Right.  
R:  -- do my part to make it a better world.
L:  Right.
R:  In little ways.  And, ah, leave the big ways to the big [PAUSE] I dunno.  Not to the big people but it's not my job so ...
L:  Right.
R:  Um.
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Calling from Seattle.
L:  Seattle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Excellent.  I'm at Colorado.  
R:  Colorado, huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, B- [LIPSMACK] Boulder?
L:  Ah, Fort Collins.
R:  Oh, yeah.  My sister lives in Boulder.
L:  Excellent.
R:  Yeah.  She --
L:  That's where I got my bachelors degree, was in Boulder.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, so what are you going for?  Masters now?
L:  I'm in my Masters right now.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  That's right.
R:  Good.  Good.  So, there, yeah, that really -- so, having a computer does really help you in your, um, in your --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, ah --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- I mean, there's definitely not a class I'm in that it's not required.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know, to --
R:  And the, um, [LIPSMACK] the, um, the [SIGH] -- I mean, you couldn't look up the -- the words as quickly, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- as you can on a computer.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  And you couldn't -- you couldn't get all of the words that fit, you know, which they can actually give you, every single word that could possibly fit, you know, and then you could pick whatever works for your situation.
L:  Well, yeah.  And not only that, I mean, like, I mean, it's -- it's completely, you know, gotten rid of, ah, you know, expensive encyclopedias, you know, because I can buy a ten dollar disk that has all that -- that information on it.
R:  But encyclopedias are not, generally, very expensive.
L:  Well, I mean --
R:  I mean to say, yes, if you want the very up to date, most current one that has all the, ah, colloquialisms in it, yes, then it would be expensive.  But if you're willing to buy the one that's ten years old, by the time you go ten years back, that's old, nowadays.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's ancient. 
L:  Er, ah --
R:  But, yeah, the ten years is, like, to me it's nothing.  Because, [LAUGH] you know, I'm older than that.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, it doesn't really matter and I know, um, I have a friend who has an encyclopedia; it's an Oxford's --
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  -- and it's not the most current one, but it does.
L:  Well, I mean, I mean, I have a set [NOISE] from nineteen eighty four that I, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- bought at -- at a garage sale years ago --
R:  Mm.  Right.
L:  -- and I -- and I still use it but --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I mean, so many -- you know, when I'm talking, you know, geographically, I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things have ch- -- you know, if I -- it's not -- you know, you look up Russia and you get the whole, you know, USSR whereas [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now, you know, it's, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thirty seven different countries and --
R:  That's very true.  Boy, and that's something too.  And all the, um, the, um, my grandparents came from Odessa which [PAUSE] was -- used to be Odessa, I think now it's called Zubec- -- Zubekeztan[?].
L:  Right.
R:  And it's the same place but its name has changed.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  To protect the innocent.
L:  [NOISE] Mm, right.
R:  So, anyway, I dunno.  You know, it -- it -- it's interesting that there's that many, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [PAUSE] little -- there again, there's all the Russian -- Russia has gone, you know, and there's still Saint Petersburg and --
L:  [SIGH] Right.  
R:  -- [inaudible] um, Russia proper, but then there's all these little places that have gone back to their original --
L:  Right.
R:  -- name or whatever.  And, um ...
L:  [MN] 
R:  I dunno if it's a good thing or a bad thing.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Just what is.  So ...
L:  How is the weather in Seattle?
R:  Nice.
L:  Nice.  Excellent.
R:  Beautiful.
L:  Excellent.  You know, I was born in Olympia, Washington.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yep.
R:  Ay, yeah.  That's a nice place, too.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.  It's, ah, well, they have the Evergreen College, the -- I think it's the junior college --
L:  That's right.
R:  But that's a nice place to, at least, to begin the education.
L:  Yeah, you know, I started, ah, my first two years right at community college, right in my local area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I went to, ah, Columbine High School.
R:  Oh, whoa, Columbine?
L:  I did.
R:  The +real Columbine? 
L:  The real Columbine.
R:  The one with the -- oh, my gosh, with the kids that ...
L:  That's right.  I was there.
R:  I'm -- well, they must -- you know, I mean, the thing is though, those boys were ad- -- [SIGH] a -- a general exception, I think, don't you think?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  They were an exception to the rule and they just kinda --
L:  You know, going -- you know, knowing that -- you know, and I -- I -- I had had conversations with bo- both those kids and --
R:  You used to have conversations with 'em?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- I had classes with these kids.  I grew up with, you know.  They were in my neighbourhood.  And, ah, it was definitely, you know, we all -- almost saw it coming, you know, I mean, I -- I always tried to be extra friendly to 'em because I knew how badly they were treated, constantly.
R:  In Columbine?  But wait a minute, are you -- I mean, you're going to graduate school.  But you -- you're only in your, like, in your twenties?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Only in your twenties?
L:  I -- I went constantly, I'm a very good, studious --
R:  Oh, ah, good. 
L:  -- student.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  I, ah, I took mostly post -- you know, I took, ah, A.P. --
