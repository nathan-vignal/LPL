R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  This is, ah, Larry.
L:  L- Larry?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi.  My name is Miranda.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Minneapolis, Minnesota.  How about yourself?
R:  Minneapolis?  I'm calling from Cincinnati, Ohio. [NOISE] 
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  And I got online and I hear that education and, ah, with computers.
L:  Yes. [COUGH] I haven't --
R:  Um --
L:  I haven't done this before, so [LAUGH]. 
R:  I -- well, I've done it a couple of times but under different, ah, ah, ideas, you know.  And different subjects.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, education, well, my kids are all educated and now I'm worried about my grandkids, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And do you have kids in school or ...?
L:  I don't have any children at all.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  I have a nephew but he is -- he -- he will be two in a couple weeks so he's a --
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, he'll --
L:  -- he's pretty young yet.
R:  Well, I know they have, ah, based in our situations here in Cincinnati, they have computers for kindergarten kids and preschool kids --
L:  Really?
R:  -- you know.  And that starts at four years old at preschool.  And then kindergarten, of course, five and then regular at six. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, I have four grandkids and they're all in school and, ah, they have learnt an awful lot with computers and --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and, ah, my two children that I have do have computers in their home.  And they're very helpful with their homework and what have you.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's -- it's very interesting, and -- and, ah, I like it and I think that computers, naturally they're not the thing of the future, they're the thing of right now, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Um, they're all over the place but they do teach the kids an awful lot, very quickly because it's right there.  I mean, they just know what, [NOISE] you know, buttons to push and they're into the library or whatever, and, ah, they can get their -- their questions answered.
L:  Right.
R:  It doesn't take as much mental thought --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as it did when I was growing up, you know, we did everything the hard way.  
L:  Right.
R:  Now they've got calculators and so on to, ah, you know, figure two and two is four.  
L:  Right.
R:  Um, where we had to do it with our brain and I still do it with my brain because of the fact that, you know, I'm used to that and possibly you are too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  Right.
R:  But, anyway, um, I think computers are very, very important in this day and age and everything happens so fast on computers, you know?  
L:  Right.
R:  Um, do you have one yourself?
L:  I do, yes.
R:  I don't have --
L:  I'm sitting in front of it right now. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, are ya? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't have, um, have a computer myself.  I'm sixty six years old --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, I just figure that computers probably would be nice --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, but I'm not home an awful lot.  I do run around a lot and do things and travel and so on.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I don't know if I'd really, you know, be interested in a computer because I guess they would tie you down to some degree.  You have to ration your time, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, don't you think?  On your end?
L:  I -- I think you do because you can get sucked into using it --
R:  'Cause you -- it -- that's right. [COUGH] 
L:  -- especially if you're online.
R:  It's almost --
L:  But, hello?
R:  -- addictive, isn't it, to some degree, if you let it to be, I guess?
L:  Yeah, I think it can be, but, ah --
R:  Because I have a couple of sister in laws that, um, have computers and gee, they -- [LAUGH] two and three hours at a time they sit there and talk to people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- do whatever else.  You know, get information, of course.
L:  Right.
R:  But I think education is very necessary.  The high schools in my Cincinnati area, um, you know, all have -- loaded[?] with computers, you know, in all the classes and what have you.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's the thing of the -- you know, it's now and also the future.  And, [SIGH] it's all necessary, I think. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  I mean, you can talk to people across the world [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it doesn't cost you anything, really.
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  So, um --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- they're interesting and -- and, you know, I may eventually get one.  My kids think I should have one but, ah, I'm a television fan.  I -- I read to some degree --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so, I don't know if it would take away from all that stuff or not.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, knowing the people that I know that have 'em, the adults, they do spend an awful lot of time on their computer.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well --
R:  They play games and so on.
L:  I think a lot of the newspapers and magazines and even television shows, these days, use the Internet to augment what they're offering.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you're watching Public Broadcasting System, PBS for instance, and they're doing a story --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, I saw a story last week about a war photographer.  You can go onto their website and find out more information about him --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and links.
R:  Everything has a website [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  It does.  So, ah, I, you know, I watch television and I read a lot also, but I have found that the Internet kinda complements the other forms of media that I use.
R:  Do ya?  Mhm.
L:  And I think it also, um, has, for me personally, even though I didn't use computers when I was going to school --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we didn't have them -- well, we had them but it -- it was only for -- we were taught how to program them which completely confused me --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I think I was in the junior high when they tried to teach us that and I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it had no, um, applicable basis for me at all.
R:  Mhm.  Sure.
L:  Um, but I know -- I'm a writer by profession and I use it --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  -- an awful lot to look up simple little things, like last week I needed to know the name of a city in [inaudible] and I couldn't remember it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, [MN] I went online and found it within a couple of minutes and I can't imagine how writers and researchers functioned before there used to be Internet.
R:  Yeah.  Sure.
L:  You would have had to gone to the library and tried to find some obscure book with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some obscure mention of whatever you were looking for.
R:  Now, you can just sit in your chair and it's in -- it's right in front of you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- within minutes, you know.
L:  Yeah.  And it -- it's come so far.  I mean, I -- when I was in college, I remember one of my assignments require that we use the computer to type up --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- a term paper and I was incredibly nervous.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think my first attempt at it somehow evaporated into thin air.
R:  Mm.
L:  I was a little frustrated.  But I look back on that now with fondness because it seems so odd --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- to me that, um --
R:  Well, I think if I were, [SIGH] you know, in my era, you know, if computers were popular, they weren't even in existence 'cept- -- except these big computers that took up a half a room or something, you know.
L:  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Now they're -- you can almost carry them in your pocket.  Ah --
L:  As people do.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's right. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I, um, you know, as I say, I might get one sometime.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, ah, I imagine it would be good for the winter months.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you know, when things may be, if you had a bad winter or whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, of course, your being from Minnesota, you probably have bad winters every year.
L:  Yes.  We do. [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah, we don't.  
L:  Oh.
R:  We have mild winters [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, ah, I mean, the snow factor, ah, here, at the -- accumulative amount through the whole of the year is maybe, oh, less than thirty inches.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, most of the time it's much less than that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you know, and you're probably talking maybe four or five feet maybe, I dunno what you guys get up there.
L:  Yeah.  That's about right. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Actually.
R:  So, um, you know, you hear st- -- different stories.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you in Billings, by any chance?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Where are you?  What city?
L:  Minneapolis.
R:  Oh, Minneapolis, Saint Paul?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah.  I was up there one time, a couple of years ago.  We had some plane problems and that's where they put us, over night, in Minneapolis, Saint Paul.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  The only time I was ever up there.  Um, but, ah, so I don't really, you know, know about our area -- your area.
L:  Right.
R:  And I guess you don't know about my area either? [LAUGH] 
L:  No, I've never been to Ohio.
R:  Um, it's, ah, we're in Cincinnati --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the southern part, near Kentucky, and the idea is, um, we're a very conservative city.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, we are, you know, well established and, of course, we've had some bad [PAUSE] oh, information put out about us because of the racial thing and what have you.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But we're not as bad as it sounds.  Huh.  Um --
L:  Oh, I didn't -- I didn't hear of this scuttle bug about --
R:  Oh, didn't you?  I'm surprised.
L:  No.
R:  Really.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Because it seems to be around and, ah, oh, I don't know, we had a cop that killed a black guy; a white cop killed a black guy, and, you know, he was running from the cop and, you know, he wouldn't stop and the cop --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and guy reaches into his -- in his jacket, so the cop thinks he's gotta gun --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and the cop shoots him.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, ah, [LAUGH] then it was, he didn't have a gun.  So, that was the big uproar and all the people kinda got in an uproar.
L:  Oh. [COUGH] 
R:  So, anyway, our city is, ah, conservative.  We have a very strict, ah, sheriff and he takes good care of our city.  But sometimes I think his strictness is maybe over done.  He's, ah, a retired, ah, marine colonel [LAUGH]. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, he kinda runs his department [LAUGH] like he ran the Marine Corps, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But, anyway, we're kinda getting off our subject, I guess.  Um, but, um, I joined this organization last week.  This three day thing, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And I think it's, ah, pretty good.  I've talked to some very nice people.  Um, [PAUSE] one, ah, was in New York, one was in, ah, San Francisco.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, ah, so this is now --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, Minnesota.  So --
L:  You've got both coasts and the Midwest.
R:  That's right.  You got it --
L:  Good coverage.
R:  -- I got it all covered.  Right.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but it's -- it's neat.  You do talk to people and -- and it's -- it's interesting.  They -- they put in their two cents' worth, you know, and I put my two cents' worth in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it seems like it, you know, a help.
L:  Right.
R:  But, certainly, back to what to we originally talked about --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, the computer thing.  Um, you know, it -- it's certainly necessary for this day and age.  
L:  Yes.  I agree.
R:  And you -- how -- how far it has come in the last ten years or whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And how far is it going go in the next ten years, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's the question.
R:  Um, you know, like, you can --
L:  It's hard to imagine where it will go but --
R:  [COUGH] Right.  Well, you know, you can call people now and you can see 'em, on your telephone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On your [LAUGH] cellphone.
L:  Sure.
R:  I mean, that's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I guess it is.  I've -- [LAUGH] I don't have one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I've, you know, read a few things about it and so on and so forth.  And it's kinda cool to see the guy or the person that you're talking to, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, so, all this stuff is just gonna get better and better and better.  Although some of the computer things might be an infringement on our privacy.
L:  Yes.
R:  Because you can find out anything on a computer about your neighbor's house --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, how much it's worth.  How much tax did they pay.  Everything.  You know, how much did they sell it for and everything?  Everything -- 
L:  Which you -- you could find out before computers, too.
