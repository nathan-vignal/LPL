L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Anne.
L:  Oh, I'm Chris.  I'm from New York.
R:  Chris from New York.  I'm from Chicago.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, how nice.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Another big city.
R:  Yay -- 
L:  Somebody I can identify with a little bit.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] No kidding.  Do you live right in New York?
L:  No, um, actually about thirty minutes outside.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, I live right in Chicago.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I used to be in Queens and I liked that.  It was about -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it was about a twenty minutes train ride right in and it was very convenient but now I'm a little further out.  So [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's hard.  [LAUGH] Sometimes you just get sick of the traffic.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  That's why I liked being there.  The -- the train was just t- totally -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- convenient.  It was nice.
R:  Ah, now I -- my daughter was talking to me during the topic.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Stuff like computers in education?
L:  Yeah, do they -- do we think that they harm or they help in education --  
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] Oh, I think they're pretty good.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I like it.  I mean, that's the way that everybody's going so why not learn it.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's how I feel too is, you know, I actually learn from my kids.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Isn't that funny how that happens?
R:  -- so, do you have any kids?
L:  I have three.
R:  Three kids.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Girls?  Boys?
L:  Um, two girls, one boy.
R:  Oh, okay.  I got three girls.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And how old are they?
R:  Fourteen, ah, twelve and seven.
L:  Oh, so you probably learn a little bit more than I do.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  How old are your kids?
L:  Six, three and two.
R:  Oh, you're at the fun stage.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they're -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the first two are very, very easy and I have that one rough one.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It's always amazing it's your third one.  [LAUGH] --  
L:  Yeah.  I was going, "Wow, I should have quit while I was ahead".
R:  [LAUGH] The one [several inaudible words], "If I had this one first [LAUGH] --" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I may not have the other ones".  [LAUGH] --" 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I wondering if what -- you know, listening to the topic, if the -- I don't know.  I feel like I don't spend enough time with her.  The last one [several inaudible words] was doing the computer were my -- my, ah, middle one, my son, he learnt when he was two. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- that's amazing.  They start learning it early.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Kindergarten, first grade.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Well, he did it on his own in the house and now he's -- he does all kinds of things off of it.  The matching, rhyming.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He knows all his numbers and his alphabet and stuff.  He's beyond kindergarten and I'm going, "Wow, I owe it to the computer".  [LAUGH] --  
R:  Amazing.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Right, so I'm -- 
R:  It's amazing.  I think -- 
L:  -- very glad.
R:  -- if you give 'em the information they really will pick it up -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, ah, to them I think the computer is a fun way to learn.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think a lot of people think that there -- it's just a lot of information overload and it -- 
R:  Sometimes I feel that way.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  I never feel like that really 'cause -- 
R:  No?  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's just -- well, it's just so easy to get some -- some information -- 
R:  It is easy to get something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know it's hard, like, um, for a while we didn't have a computer and my kids kept getting assignments that they had to get on the internet and we didn't have, um, the internet.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh.
R:  And that was difficult because then I had to find ways to get to the library or get to my husband's work -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or, you know, those kind of things and it made it much more inconvenient.  So, sometimes I'd think, you know, some people may not always have an access to a computer -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, the school should make a way for them, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do their homework at school or [LAUGH] -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- or that -- which my kids' school did eventually accommodate them and, um, let them do some of their work at school and then I [several inaudible words], "We have got to get the internet".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  But, of course, now my kids are on -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- twenty four hours a day.
L:  Wow.
R:  So, it's amazing that people can even get through on my phone.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, I've got a teenage -- well, a teenage and preteen daughter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, they just -- they're, you know, emailing their friends all the time and I -- so once they get on -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they'll say they're going on for homework -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and then they switch over the email.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Or instant messaging.
L:  Taking over from the phone.  Back in the day it was the phones.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  This is the new phone.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Thank God.
R:  You know, but she's got a cell phone too.  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, good God.
R:  Yeah, basically, ah, she takes the city bus home -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and so I can kind of keep track of her when she's going to school and, ah, so -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's like the cell phone is kind of a safety thing -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- for me, [LAUGH] you know? 
L:  Ah -- 
R:  But, I think the computer -- you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm amazed at what my kids have learned.  I -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I ask them, "I don't know how to do this".  And they come right over and they show me immediately.  So -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- do you work outside the home?
L:  Ah, I -- I do both actually.  Some's -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- in, some's out.
R:  In and out, huh?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Do you do computer -- 
L:  -- have three jobs.  So -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it's a -- you know, some of it's out and some of it's --  
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- you know, one -- yeah.
R:  That's nice.  Kind -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- of being with your kids and kind of not.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  One day I'm out.  So, um -- 
R:  Oh, that's not bad.
L:  The rest of the time I take them or I don't take them depending on, you know, what's going on with what I'm doing.
R:  That's cool.
L:  But, I do know that, you know, what you said about the computer work at school.  It's so true.  There's a lot of people out there that really -- ah, some can't afford it. 
R:  No.
L:  Even in this day and age.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I remember that when I went back for my second degree that that was the first time I heard that they were, ah -- well, in one of my classes they were requiring -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you had -- that you had internet access.  And I'm like, I -- I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't have a computer.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  [LAUGH] I mean -- 
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- for us it was kind of tough for a while 'cause it was a -- we had a second hand computer -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it was so -- you know, a dinosaur.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, it really wasn't, ah, internet compatible.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, ah, you know, so it was kind of hard 'cause it was like, okay, this is really going to become a requirement -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- more often -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for our kids and it's something we're going to have to do.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's why -- you know, and we -- we work -- actually, my husband's a minister at a small inner city church.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, a lot of the people we work with, um, the kids, they live in projects -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't -- they don't have computers.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  You know?  They do not have access to it and I find their education is a little bit behind.  Um, you know, the -- even the schools that they go to don't really have a lot of computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're just starting to get computers.  But -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you can -- you can tell the difference -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, 'cause we did start like an after school program and we started doing a little bit of computer training and, um, had a bunch of computers at our church and you know, the kids were just very much at base level in fifth and sixth grade.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, that's fantastic for them.  Well, whether we agree with it or we don't, I mean, that's the way the world's going.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's a good thing.  I think it is a good thing overall and I think as the world gets more and more into this, I really think I see -- 'cause I even see in our cities how the schools are starving to make access a little bit more easy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so I think eventually there will be ways.  And the kids can go to the library.  You know, I have to say a lot of the kids that -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, we have a library, you know, one that's six blocks from the projects.  There's another one that's a mile away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you know, they have probably ten, twelve computers that, um, you can go on line -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pretty much any time you want.  So -- 
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- so, you know, if you go -- you got the public libraries and stuff like that, [SIGH] there are ways.  So, I -- I think it's great.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  My daughter's taking a computer class in high school now and, ah, I mean, they're doing, you know, grids and bar graphs and -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- how to make schedules and do your checkbook.  I mean, everything, [LAUGH] you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- so -- so, that's why -- 
L:  I've got to take one of those classes.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  I know.  That's what I think too.  [LAUGH] It's like, they're -- they're learning --
L:  Can I just -- 
R:  -- so much --  
L:  -- fit in?
R:  I know.  They do Powerpoint and they do, ah -- you know, they do presentations on the computer.  I got my [several inaudible words] right now.  Um, you know, so, it's amazing.  I went to their school and they had, ah -- a kid gave his speech, his presentation right off the computer -- 
L:  Wow.
R:  -- using a Powerpoint system [MN] and it was really cool.  You -- 
L:  That is amazing.
R:  -- know, it was like everything popped up on the screen and he had all the things he wanted to say and different pictures popped up and I'm like, wow, [LAUGH] it's so professional and they're in seventh grade.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my God.  That is amazing.
R:  So, that -- I think it really gives them confidence and it gives them -- you know, just -- they -- they're knowing something and it's -- it's moving fast.  It's giving them a lot of information and -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I -- I really -- I, for the most part, think it's a good idea.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's so wonderful though that you guys have that program there to your husband and to the church and everything because -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- you know, I know that for, ah, way back when I -- my only access was through the library and that was kind of difficult 'cause everybody was doing it -- 
R:  Everybody's -- 
L:  -- that way.
R:  -- there.  Yeah.
L:  And now, if I didn't -- well, her dad -- ah, you know, I'm a single mother and her -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- dad bought her this computer for Christmas and it was kind of for all of us but, um -- 
R:  That's nice.
L:  -- I was saving up points on a credit card thing [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh.  And that -- 
L:  -- to get it.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- will take a long time.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I was almost there.
R:  Oh, were you?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  But, I said, "Ooh, let me just stall a little longer 'cause he's getting --" 
R:  Cool.
L:  -- nasty about her having one".  So [LAUGH] --" 
R:  That is cool.  Well, now you can use your points for something else.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Well, yeah, and I did -- actually, I gave back, I did, because I felt so good about having gotten this for free that -- 
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- I -- I got a whole bunch of gift certificates and things like that that I -- 
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- could get and I gave them to a family of eight.
R:  Oh, it's so neat.
L:  For Christmas, yeah.  My daughter [several inaudible words].  But, in her school -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- too, they just -- it was a big deal to them to get these two computers in their kindergarten class.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I went -- and I saw them.  I said -- they were pretty much not internet compatible [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] That's what happens.  I know our church -- the ones we get donated -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're usually obsolete for businesses.  They're not that great but they're good for entry level teaching.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I guess, yeah. 
R:  You -- you know, typing a paper or whatever [LAUGH] you know?
L:  They were -- they were sitting there going, "Oh, we got computers" -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and I'm thinking, "All right, technology".
R:  Yeah, really --
L:  And I go in there and they're learning, "Okay, well, here's this shape and color" and -- 
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- you know, those game things.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Oh, my God.  So, they're going to learn how to use the mouse.  Probably these kids will all probably know how to use a mouse.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Right.  Right, they'll [LAUGH] -- they'll know how to play games on the computer.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.  And you know, they're supposed -- 
R:  Which they all seem to know instinctively anyway.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, I -- oh, God, yeah.  [LAUGH] --  
R:  I used to babysit a three year old kid -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he would always go over to my computer -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he knew how to turn it on and he knew how to find the games -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- on the computer.  He knew how to find the word, game -- 
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- and could click on to game.  I mean, on --
