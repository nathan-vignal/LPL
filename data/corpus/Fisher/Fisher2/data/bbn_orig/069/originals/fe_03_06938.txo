R:  [NOISE]
L:  Tamara Frater.
R:  Hi, my name is Christie Milan.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Fine thank you.  How are you?
L:  Good.
R:  That's good.
L:  So they say our topic is computers in education. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, so that's very appropriate for me because I, um, teach school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I teach computer lab, so --
R:  Oh, there you go. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- they couldn't have gotten a better topic.
R:  There you go, perfect.
L:  So naturally I think, uh, computers are very important in education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't think that they should start only in middle school or high school --
R:  [MN]
L:  I think that they should start as -- as young as elementary school --
R:  I completely agree.
L:  -- and -- and that's where I work, in the elementary school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think that's just the most important place, even for the first graders.  We start with first graders --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and go on up so ...
R:  Oh, absolutely.  I -- when I was, uh, uh, little -- I'm -- I'm fairly young, we had them in kindergarten and these were -- this is a while ago so they weren't very good but, I mean, I grew up on them and if I hadn't I don't think I could be doing anything now because so many jobs require it so it's good to have, uh, a longstanding experience with computers, I think.
L:  Right.
R:  So I completely agree [LAUGH]. I think it's -- it should be mandatory.  Um, even if -- my daughter's in kindergarten, actually, and they have a computer.
L:  Really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, my daughter's in kindergarten, too.  She just graduated kindergarten, went -- going into first grade so ...
R:  Oh, there you go. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And they all -- at the school where I work they all have computers, every classroom --
R:  Yeah, well, that's great.
L:  -- has a computer for the students --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I, um, was not exposed to computers at a early age.
R:  Yes.
L:  I took an interest in computers when I was in college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm about thirty four years old now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but when I was in college I took an interest in computers and decided to major in computer science --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and from that point on I've just been, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- working in that field.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So ...
R:  Well, it's -- it's -- it's a -- a good thing to start at any point in life, I guess --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but, see, I was lucky my father -- before computers were even mainstream, he was a computer engineer --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, uh, I was raised to [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  From him.  He was using them when they took little cards and, you know, they didn't have monitors and stuff, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] -- I -- I've always had them and this is what I do now is -- all my work is actually on the internet.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So ... and this is another thing, the internet is something that kids can use --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for school for research and -- and, well, as long as they're supervised 'cause I know there's a lot of problems with plagiarism and, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- stuff like that, so long as they're supervised on the internet but [SIGH] the internet is such a -- a useful tool, uh --
L:  Right, and I -- I allow my son, he's in the fifth grade, going to the sixth grade, and I allow him to use the internet as well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to do research for school.
R:  Exactly, and it can expose them to, uh, new views on old topics, too.  Some of the sites like, uh, National Geographic and stuff like that have some incredible, uh, like, displays --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- online and stuff like that and I think it's -- it's interesting and it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You can also see, uh, on museum websites sometimes they put up virtual displays of what they've got [SIGH] so you can see things that you'd never see otherwise [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause you're not going to go travel all around the world to museums so -- [NOISE] yes, sweetie.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] So, yes, computers in education, absolutely important.
L:  Right, and I think every child should know how to use a computer --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, on their own and, like you said, you need to monitor them --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- when they're using the internet but, like, for my children I allow them to actually do the clicking and moving around --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I just sit over --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and monitor, the same way we do at the school.  We have, um, websites at the school --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but they're, um -- we -- we make internal websites.  We --
R:  Oh.
L:  We block certain places that they can't go to.  You know, we give them places that they can go and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- free -- freely click around and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just get ex- -- exposed to the internet and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or the intranet, mhm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at school, as well.
R:  Well, that's great 'cause I don't think we had the internet in school until high school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and even then we were all at least fourteen then and even then it was so heavily censored [LAUGH] um, by software because back then software was really big to use then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so we didn't get [SIGH] -- you know, you did -- weren't exposed to some things that you shouldn't be but there were other things, um, like websites on pregnancy and things like that that were also blocked.  So I think, uh, the human supervision is so important, uh, because you never know what the software might miss --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what it might take too much of.
L:  And what's out there.  Exactly --
R:  So ...
L:  -- what's out there.  Did you go -- did you go to, uh, schools in urban area or rural area or ...?
R:  It was -- it's a suburban --
L:  Suburban?
R:  -- area, yeah.
L:  Okay.  See, I went to schools in a rural area.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's always interesting to compare --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, what's available between the two, so ...
R:  Yeah, well, and I'm also in the largest city in Canada --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, uh, I think that's another reason why we would have had the computers earlier and, you know, we have, uh, more funding and so for -- for those kind of things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whereas in rural areas they -- I don't know, they don't get the same benefits --
L:  Right, I grew -- 
R:  -- which is a shame.
L:  I grew up in a small town in South Carolina --
R:  Ah, they [LAUGH] --
L:  -- but, like, my children now -- we're in -- we're in Atlanta, Georgia, now --
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  -- and my children get a whole -- whole lot more exposure than we got, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in South Carolina 'cause it's just a little small town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, always like the last to get everything.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  So even in the school system --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but -- and my mother, um, also works in the school system.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She teaches reading --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and she's done that ever since I was, uh, small and they have just now, within the last three years, started going to computer programs --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to assist the children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in her program with reading.  She, um, teaches the slow readers --
R:  Ah, yeah.
L:  -- to keep them on pace and on track with their peers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they've just recently gone a little bit more from the one on one instruction --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- to partly one on one instruction and partly computer instruction.
R:  Yes.  Well, I know, with my daughter learning to read, the computer -- the programs for reading on the computer were incredibly helpful --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because with me, I don't know, she -- she tends not to learn [LAUGH] with me but with the computer and with school together I think she learned so much and now she's -- she's doing pretty well on her own.  So I think for a lot of parents who don't know how to teach their children to read and I didn't know where to start really [LAUGH] other than reading her books --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and taking her along.  They certainly help and there's such a variety --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of different ones.  There's Winnie the Pooh and then there's Reader Rabbit and you can attack it from so many different ways --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with the program so I think it's certainly an exciting, uh, avenue to explore.  Okay, sweetheart.
L:  Right, and I did that a little bit with my daughter, too, because I was one of those that I didn't exactly know where to start --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for where she was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I purchased some of the, uh, computer programs, like the Reader Rabbits and the, um, adventures -- um, uh, Reader Rabbit Adventures and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and also I had a teacher at the school recommend to me a different type of computer.  It was, uh, the Leapfrog --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- interactive leap pad --
R:  Yeah, those are great.
L:  -- and that made a huge difference --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with her.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, so just not the computer that you're attached to --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] -- at your home but, you know, you have computers on the outside of the home as well.
R:  Exactly.
L:  The little learning tools --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- but, um, they -- I think they all really make a impact on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the students and I think the students who have access to that are definitely going to be above and beyond --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- those that don't --
R:  Yeah, which is a shame --  
L:  -- in the long run.
R:  -- that they're not all available to -- to everyone, that's the problem.  But I do know there are groups out there that are trying to get computers to everybody --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and computer access to everybody, at least in the States.  I don't know so much up here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I -- I've heard about that and I think that's wonderful because everybody should have access to all the tools they can to be the best they can be in the end.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So ... and once you get to college, if you don't know how to use a computer, you know, most things you have to [LAUGH] know how to use a computer --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- at this point so ...
L:  Right, typewriters are a thing of the past --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- even for typing papers and --
R:  Yeah.  Well, most -- most teachers [NOISE] here won't accept handwritten papers anymore --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that -- the school provides a computer lab and that's why, um, they can actually say that because they say, "Well, you have gone to sch- -- the computer lab [LAUGH] and typed it up".
L:  Right, or -- right and -- or, like the students around here --
R:  Mm.
L:  My son, he was in the fifth grade and certain reports had to be typewritten on the computer --
R:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
L:  -- and if you didn't have a computer at home you had to go to the library --
R:  Yeah, see that's another good thing --
L:  -- and use the computer at the library.
R:  -- is that the libraries are providing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- computers and internet, sometimes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so that's -- that's beneficial but I know we can't actually, at our libraries, type up anything.  We can print web pages --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but there's no word processing program.
L:  Right.
R:  So that's, uh --
L:  They have a few computers here in each library that have word processing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just for the students.  It's like a student center --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you go over to the student center and you can work in the student center.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  And also we have, um -- there's a program here with, the, uh, local grocery stores, I think Publics and Ingles and Kroger are part of that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, you carry cards for your school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and every time you buy, you swipe your card --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and at the end of, uh, each school year there's so much money --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that goes to that school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- depending on how much was spent and it's for computers and books and --
R:  Yeah, well, that's great.
L:  -- things like that so there are programs around here as well --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- geared at getting more computers into the schools.
R:  Well, that's wonderful.  The only --
L:  Right, and the school that I work at is -- I consider it to be really progressive because we have not only a -- a computer in each classroom but there are three computer labs --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- at the school.
R:  That's great.
L:  Two IBM and one Mac lab so ...
R:  Wow [LAUGH] that's progressive --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's incredible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's incr- --
L:  So I think that's really progressive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've only been there -- this is my first complete school year there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so -- but I thought it was really progressive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- over the -- the school where I came from where you had two and three teachers sharing a computer.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So, mhm.
R:  Well, that's great.  I know even the high school here it has, you know, couple of thousand students and they only have one computer lab so that's wonderful.
L:  Mm.
R:  That's -- you're very lucky. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Your students are very lucky there.
L:  Well, my children are very lucky I think, you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Like I said, I didn't have access to that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I took interest in it late in life but for them, because I had so much -- have so much interest in it, for them it's sort of like I pushed them --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in that same direction and what I've done --
