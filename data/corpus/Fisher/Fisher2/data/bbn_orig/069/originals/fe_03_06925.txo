R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, my name is Terry.  I'm from Texas.
L:  Hi, um, I just got home and my little boy answered the phone, so I'm not really sure what's going on here [LAUGH].
R:  Um, this is from the Fisher the Univ- ah, what is it, University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.
R:  Do you remember signing up for that?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  But I only got, like I said, I only got the very first part of it and I just pushed buttons because they told me to [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, well actually, I missed what the topic of the day was the first time when she said it.  I didn't understand her, so I just held and I've been holding for like almost ten minutes waiting for somebody else and just now she said the topic of the day was "Do we think there are any countries in particular that are a threat to the United States and if so, which countries and why do we feel that way?".
L:  I think terrorists are.
R:  Right.  Well, I believe that's what they're talking about, is terrorists.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um, the countries that they're fighting with now, Iraq, um --
R:  The Arab nations.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  That's the only thing that I could think of.  I mean, I don't see or I have not heard of any reason to believe any other countries, um, I know France isn't real happy with us [LAUGH].
L:  M- no, they're not happy with us and at first I thought there might be a prob- -- well, I didn't figure any terrorist attacks or anything, but I knew England wasn't real happy when their um some of their people in their armed forces started getting killed.
R:  Well, that's true.  Yeah, I hadn't thought about them at all.  But if -- the only things that I could think of that I would think would still be any type of a threat would be the Arab Nations because well, because we know they're still out there someplace.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, we know that there are still terrorists there that have still been threatening us.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Um and then the thing when they keep I- -- changing the alerts, like orange and yellow --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they don't really give you a reason why, so you don't know who is involved in what and why.
R:  Right.  And the only thing I can assume when they change them from, you know, medium alert up to a high alert is obviously somebody is making some type of threat.
L:  Right.  But and I -- I kind of -- I believe the public has a right to know, but ah well, but if they did, there would be so many people panicking.
R:  That's true, they would.  I mean, even now I don't know um about you, but I belong to several forum groups ah --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for different things --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I know on this one site that I'm on there are people oh apparently there's a -- I know the list has about twelve hundred people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I know that there's been a lot of people that have wrote in that ah like one woman said, "You know, I'm part" -- she was part French, part Italian, part something else --
L:  Gee.
R:  -- and she was half a -- half Arabic --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she said she was in the grocery store not too long ago and she said this woman just walked up to her, got right in her face and asked her, "What in the hell are you doing in this country?  Why are you here?".
L:  Whoa.
R:  And she was born and raised here.  But, you know, people -- and then there was -- when she wrote that in of course then there was a slew of others that wrote in too saying, "Yeah, well, I'm, you know, part Iranian, or I'm part whatever" and it was amazing to me how many were.  Just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- out of this group.  And they all said they have been confronted and even other people that said, you know, "Well, I'm not Iranian, I'm not Arabic, but I'm Italian" and --
L:  Right, it's the color of their skin --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and their tone and --
R:  Right.  She said, "But I've got that same skin tone and people give me dirty looks, they make snide, rude comments" so it -- it's just amazing.
L:  I've -- I've heard people on our local news, they -- with their [several inaudible words] from the Arabic countries and that and I -- I'm kind of shake- -- I know it's their religion and everything for the women to wear these long dresses and cover their faces and this and that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I -- my personal opinion about this, if they're going to be here, let's get rid of some of this so people around 'em knows what's going on.
R:  When in Rome, do as the Romans?
L:  Right.
R:  Basically, yeah.  But then again, it's not just the Arab nations that do that, look at all the Indian women --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that wear the what do they call it, sari -- saris?
L:  There's -- there's been a -- a conflict on television and I'm not sure -- I'm not sure exactly where it was -- I'm in Indiana --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I'm not sure if it was like here in -- over in Cincinnati, but where it was, about a woman that applied for a driver's license and they accidentally let her leave her face covering on --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- but yet when they took a picture of her for a mugshot for something, it was undone and now she's fighting saying that it's her right of religion to keep this covering her face.  And I'm thinking, "It's your driver's license photo" I think it should be un- uncovered, in my personal opinion.
R:  Right.  Because it's for identification purposes.
L:  Right.
R:  How can somebody identify you if you your faces covered?
L:  Right.  And that's --
R:  I mean, that's like I could put a ski mask on and say, "Okay, I want you to take my picture like this because this is what I wear all the time" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that doesn't make a lot of sense.
L:  No, it doesn't.  And I don't think she should have the right to do it.
R:  I don't think so, either.  I mean, it -- it just doesn't sound logical.  I mean, how can somebody use that as a photo identification if they cannot see your face?
L:  Well, they -- they did have her -- they showed her where she was [LIPSMACK] let's see, it was a mugshot for something that she had done and she -- they had her face uncovered there [COUGH].
R:  Uh.  Strange.
L:  Excuse me.
R:  I don't think she should have a right to complain about it.
L:  No.  I don't either.
R:  I mean, if she was in her own country, then maybe she could, you know, I could see doing that.  If that's what all the women do.
L:  Right.
R:  But if she's not in her own country and even though she still has her religion and her faith, that taking one picture like that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to me wouldn't -- wouldn't be um, what's the word?  Like betraying your faith.
L:  Right, um, I know what you're talking about.  I can't think of what --
R:  Yeah, I couldn't think of the word to describe exactly what I meant, but -- but other than that, I can't think of any other --
L:  I ca- I can't either.  I don't --
R:  And I don't think, you know --
L:  I don't know if --
R:  I think of, you know, Canada, Braz- --
L:  -- any --
R:  -- um, South America, I don't -- you know, I don't think of any of those countries that you know for any reason that you know I would have any indication.  It would -- the only ones I can think of would be the like you said, Iraq, Iran, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- the countries, the Arabic countries where -- where they're having threats against all the time.
L:  Right.  But yet the -- the United States is over there, there helping rebuild what they tore down.
R:  Right.  Ah, but they don't look at it that way.  They a lot, well, a lot of them don't.  You know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- some of them do.  But a lot of them are like, you know, well, we're just in their way and you know we're probably giving them poisoned food and what not --
L:  Right.  I kind of -- I kri- -- kind of agree with the rebuilding thing but in a way I -- I know the people -- well, I started to say, the people aren't responsible, but there's a lot of the people that there that are against the United States being their even though they're freeing them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there's people here in the United States, charity begins at home.
R:  Well, that's the way I look at it.  I -- I get real aggravated with us sending money to all these different nations --
L:  Extr- oh --
R:  -- all the time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you know, I know people that are hungry here --
L:  Yes, I do too.
R:  -- and I can look around in my hometown and I see people walking the streets.  I see people that you know that I see if not on a daily basis, I'll usually see them some place around town, two, three times a week and I have for years.  I don't know where they live at night --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know if they go to the Salvation Army, I don't know if they live under a bridge someplace --
L:  But they could go to Iraq and have a home.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  They could go to any of the foreign countries and United States would make sure they had a home.
R:  Right.
L:  And there was a -- a man that was here at our house today and we were talking and he is -- he can't work, they had sent him to -- he's gone to several different doctors and they said his back was just about beyond repair but yet he cannot get any help at all.
R:  Well, I understand that.  Um, years ago [SIGH] gosh, my step father died fourteen years ago, but I remember when he and my mother had moved to Texas and he had emphysema real bad and he just -- he couldn't -- I mean, he couldn't walk, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he'd walk from the car to the front door and he'd -- he'd be bent over just [MN] you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he couldn't breathe.  And he had, well, he had worked since he was a young boy, I mean he was from East Texas, which I don't know how much you know about that, but East Texas is kinda like sometimes the way they talk about um parts of Mississippi or --
L:  [inaudible] [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know, kind of back woods --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they had that old country talk and everything.  And he was -- had worked since he was a young boy and when he got to be like a teenager he left home -- gosh, they had like twelve kids in the family, I think he was the youngest one -- but he went ahead and he left and he was a rodeo rider --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean he rode the bulls, he rode busted broncs and
