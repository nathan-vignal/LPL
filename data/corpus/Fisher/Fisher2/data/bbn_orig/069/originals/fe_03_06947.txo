R:  Hi, my name's Dolores. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name's Lisa.
R:  [NOISE] Hi, Lisa.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  How are ya?
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  [MN]
R:  This is a [inaudible] conversation about education with computers, huh?
L:  Uh, yeah, looks like that's what it is.  It's pretty interesting, I guess.  Something I can handle. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, sounds really interesting.  I mean, computers nowadays is the greatest. [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's very important that the kids know how to use them and use them properly, um --
R:  Yes.  Do you have a computer at home?
L:  Plenty. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, I've got one, too, and, uh, in fact, uh, I've got my son and he's got my granddaughter.  She's seven and she loves the computer.  I mean, it's doing excellent for her in school.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  They have computers in the classrooms, too, by us.
R:  Do they?
L:  Yeah, they -- we have one for the kids and the teacher has her own and she brings up some educational websites on occasion --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we'll teach them a few things from these interesting websites that she has.
R:  Yeah, that's really great, it's real -- I said, I wish we had stuff like that when we were kids.
L:  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, it would have been nice.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, it's so easy.  If the kids ask a question you don't know, then you can just go and look it up.
R:  I know, it's -- it's -- like, before we had just, you know, calculators with numbers.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Now this like -- I mean, it's right there in front of you, just push two little knobs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or little buttons or whatever.  Yeah, it's just fantastic.
L:  And they can get information that, you know, previously, if you had to look in an encyclopedia you couldn't always get.
R:  Yes, ex- --
L:  And now you can get from a different country if you have to [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, really --
L:  -- which is absolutely wonderful.
R:  -- don't even need a book anymore. [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely wonderful for the kids because a lot of the information that would take a long time to obtain now you can get them right away in the classroom or right away at home, if they ask a question you don't know, there it is.  There's always something [LAUGH] for it. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, do you have --
L:  I definitely think it helps. [NOISE]
R:  Do you have kids at home that use the computer?
L:  Oh, yes.  I have, uh, three kids --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and the oldest one likes to do Google searches [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and learn about different various things.
R:  Well, that's --
L:  We use them, uh -- he had to keep a dictionary in preschool --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and every week we had to bring in a different letter, co- -- pictures from a different letter of the alphabet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and when I couldn't find anything interesting in a magazine, we went on to Google, we ty- -- I asked him for some words that began with that letter, we typed it in, we found pictures and we bring them in.
R:  God, I mean, that is -- that is great.
L:  It was perfect and I wouldn't have to save all my magazines [LAUGH] around the house for them.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean, whatever takes now in five minutes, it took, like, hours before.
L:  Right, exactly.  It's more interesting for them.  They can see it, er, immediate gratification for the kids --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they can see it in color and, you know, they get excited when they type in, you know, whatever they need, like grapes or eggplants and --
R:  Yeah, and it's like --
L:  -- there comes a picture on the screen.
R:  Yeah, and they can just push print and they have a copy of it.
L:  Oh, yes --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they're good at doing that. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, and there's just so many activities --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff that they can do on the computer --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- with games and, you know, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- projects and, I mean, you can go on and on and on.
L:  Yes, and they start them so young.  In preschool --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, my kids each, from the first year on, when they three and a half, all the way until they finished at the age five --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- got one -- at least one day a week of computer time in preschool.
R:  Oh.
L:  They would bring them into the library where they had a whole circle of computers and there would be what, two, usually two kids for a computer, depending on the class, and they would have educational games for the kids to play.
R:  God, I know.
L:  Alphabet game book and the games --
R:  Yeah, it's fan- --
L:  -- and that's, you know, aged three [LAUGH] and some of them I think at aged two may even be doing it in -- in -- but I didn't send them to preschool that young so I don't know that. [MN]
R:  Yeah, it is fantastic.  The kids are just so smart.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They got the advantage of doing everything.  I mean, I'm --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm trying to spend as much time as I can on the computer but I don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [LAUGH] And even for, you know, adults to go back to school later in life, you know, a lot of the kid -- adults I know go to community colleges around here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and to help them just write their papers and do their research.  They don't have to leave their children [NOISE] to go to a library, they can do it right at home. [NOISE]
R:  Yes, I know --
L:  All right, sweetie?
R:  -- it -- it's just fantastic with computers.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I -- I've had mine --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, over two years and I didn't mess with it until --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would say, about a year and a half --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and I just love.  I mean, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm on the chat lines and everything, you know.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you belong to RMC?
L:  To which?
R:  RMC?
L:  [MN] Uh --
R:  Do you know what that is?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay, because the last girl that I talked to she belonged to that and we had a chit chat like, you know, about, you know, same thing we're doing now so I thought maybe you -- you know, because meet somebody else the same thing. [MN]
L:  Oh, what is that?
R:  It's -- it's a chat line, [NOISE] Refund, uh, Makes Sense Mag- -- Magazine.
L:  Oh, I had no idea.
R:  Yeah, it's -- it's a website and we chat line -- chat through it and get a lot of information on what's going on out there.
L:  Oh, that --
R:  You know, it's another way of using the computer.
L:  That's interesting, I hadn't heard of that one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, it was -- it --
L:  I spend so much time with my kids doing their stuff that I never get much time for me. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, well basically it's -- basically what it is I do use the computer for that information and stuff and I chat with some girls all around the United States and we do refunding and a whole bunch of stuff.
L:  Oh, I'd love to know about that.
R:  Yeah.  We send forms to each other and stuff, whole bunch of things.
L:  Ah, was that just R.M.C. dot com or ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah.
R:  Refund Makes Sense is what it is dot com, yeah. [MN]
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah, it's really fantastic but, like I said, it's the computer so [MN] --
L:  Yeah, and you get to, you know, meet people --
R:  Yeah, you -- I --
L:  -- from all walks of life.
R:  I'm always emailing stuff, so I mean it's the computer again, before I was with the magazine and you're always mailing stuff, like and now I can talk to them and say, "Okay, hi, I got this for you, you got me this" or whatever.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  So, I mean, it's the computer back and forth again, you know.
L:  That's right, and when the kids see us using them, they feel more confident using them, I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They just -- you know, "Mum and dad could do it, hey this isn't bad", you know, it's --
R:  Yeah, it can relate to a family and stuff and as far as, like you said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- school and stuff, god I mean, there's -- there's so many things on a computer.
L:  Yeah, it's amazing.  You never thought, you know, ten years ago where we'd be with this [LAUGH] today and --
R:  I know, it's just advancing so much.  I mean, you buy, you know, a computer and you buy the software and all of a sudden --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's obsolete in six months, you know.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] oh, it seems that way, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You can't keep up with it.
L:  Oh, I know, I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I know.  I love it though. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I do, too.  In fact, I was --
L:  It's such a part of life, you know.  I think they had asked a question, I read in a magazine they did a survey of people, "What would you be able to do without?" and it was like TV, computer and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- something else and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- most people could not do without the computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They picked the computer over the TV, even.
R:  Yeah, I watch TV a lot but the computer, it -- you know, I mean, I check every morning 'cause I got email --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I got stuff out there, I'm waiting to get a response back and --
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  And I came upstairs just now to check email because I was waiting for a response from one of the girls, you know, to let me know if she wants something, and [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's just fantastic.  I mean, the computer is so good, I mean, for adults, for kids, even grandparents, anybody.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  They get pictures, we get movies, everything for them.
R:  Yeah, and it could be all around the world and doesn't cost anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and you can say hi to somebody and then there's no money involved and, you know, nothing, it's just, you know, "Hi, how are ya?" [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and vacation planning.  I mean, the kids -- the kids are learning --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- more than I will ever learn and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm learning a lot so I'm -- I'm figuring, wow, you know, by the time they're -- they're grown and in college, I can't imagine, they're all going to have to have a laptop at school and they're all going to have to have them at their desks and what have you, I bet.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's just fantastic, it's just -- so, how many phone calls have you done already so far?
L:  Um, this is only the first one I was there -- I accepted [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- because the other two topics [LAUGH] weren't quite my --
R:  Oh, this is my second.
L:  My scene. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact, my husband found out about it and when I told him about it, he said, "Well, don't you tell me the information, I'll do it, too".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's, "Oh,  didn't know you'd be interested". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't think he would be [LAUGH] but he's good at that stuff, talking to people like that, so ...
R:  Yeah, well I like to chit chat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's just like on the computer, you know, I can't, you know, type as fast.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- you know, I'd rather be on the phone to talk --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because you can say what you want to say quick --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but the computer, I mean, is there and, like I said, with the advantages for the kids and for everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the kids --
L:  And even the teachers.  I mean, I -- I can't imagine the teacher's finding these websites and she's just -- you know, one day I was there watching them and she just brought up a website and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- brought up -- you know, and they gave information on, I think, how to tell temperature or something like that --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- and she just showed that, showed a short little video clip and she discussed and there was questions at the end and she was -- they have the TV screen hooked up to the computer and she just typed it right in.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, basically you just need your word like weather or map or -- or whatever --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- and she got -- she got exactly this educational website that she wanted and she even wrote it down for me, [LAUGH] she said, "Just in case you want it".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the kids -- I mean, the kids don't have access to that, they have certain specific things in their computer, I think, just games --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and basic math programs and stuff but, um, I think one day my son had had a question, he was trying to find [MN] a picture of something they were talking about --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and they couldn't find it on the computer so she, like, actually let him use her computer to try and locate this --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because she has the search engines on hers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, I mean, just crazy how in a classroom that five year olds, [LAUGH] six year olds are doing this, not even older than that, you know --
R:  Yeah, isn't that --
L:  -- you'd think they'd save that for, you know, older kids but they're doing it at five.
R:  Yeah, isn't that -- I mean, it's fantastic.  I mean, a five and six year old, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're so smart, I mean, you know, the kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, like I said, years ago they didn't have that, I mean, they went to kindergarten and they learned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this and that and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- now it's like they're like three years ahead of time, you know what I mean?
L:  Oh, oh yeah.  They're working independently --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they have their own journals, they're reading independently and I think, you know, it's -- it's -- I don't know if it's good [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know either but --
L:  If it's good or bad.  They're growing up too fast. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they're not a kid anymore, are they?
L:  No, I know.
R:  I know our grandkids are like that.  It's like, "Oh, my god, you're seven and you know more than I do" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, you know, you ask them questions and they an -- or they answer a question and they say, "Is that right?" and you're going to say, "You know, I don't know". [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's like, I got to find out because I don't know if that's true or not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, no, really it is, "Oh, is it, okay?"  "We're doing it in school".  "Oh, okay, if you say it's true then ..." [LAUGH] You know, and you wonder. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, it is, it's fan -- fantastic.  Uh, I just -- I think it's just a great thing and it is, I guess, if the kids are learning so much, we're learning so much and we're -- and there's always something else to learn.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, and --
L:  Yes, and they're always curious, 'cause they're curious which makes it even better.
R:  It's like, what else is there out there to explore, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anything? [LAUGH]
L:  They're the best ones for this because they have the most curious minds right now.  Everything for them is a question or a -- a problem or something that needs a solution so --
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  -- they're the best for this type of stuff and they absorb so well --
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  -- they're perfect. [LAUGH]
R:  And especially if they're interested [LAUGH] too and it's good --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get for the kids because I think if they're into computers and there's so much to do they -- they will enjoy school and everything else more.
L:  Yes.
