R:  Christine.
L:  It's Tanya Hilmer.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yes, hello?
R:  Yes, hello, Tanya?
L:  Yes, hi, Christine. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Hi.
L:  Um, yeah, this is the first time I've done this so I don't quite know how it works. [LAUGH]
R:  Mine, too.
L:  [LAUGH] Is that for you, too, or ...?
R:  Yeah, it's my first time also.
L:  Oh, so [MN] --
R:  Yeah, I think they said the topic was education?
L:  Uh, yeah, it's how you feel that computers, um, affect education or harm education, yeah.
R:  Educ- -- how computers affect education?
L:  Yeah, either if you feel they benefit or harm education so ...
R:  Well, I -- with the computer games, the -- they ha- -- they do have some [NOISE] online games that the kids can use --
L:  Really.
R:  -- to help them with, uh [NOISE] -- something similar to phonics, I do believe --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and math.  My -- one of my son has a math game but adding and subtracting --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and it was -- when he first started playing it, it was too advanced for him but then when he started doing adding and subtracting in school it made it easier --
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  -- for him to pick up.
L:  Right, right.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I -- I would say that there would -- um, computers, uh, definitely benefits education, just, uh, making it [several inaudible words] too old for, you know, like year [inaudible] assignments that -- that make the -- some of the programs that they have available, um, for children.  Um, I really think it's definitely, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- definitely [inaudible] to have, compared to when they didn't have the opportunity to -- to have computers, um, available, so, um --
R:  But I think a lot of college students use the computers to do their essays and theses --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- to type 'em up.
L:  Right, definitely, so, it's definitely good to get started, um, at a young age on computers, um, just, um, you know because obviously in later life, going into the workforce, it's good to have a skill that has, um, work and a, um -- work and some type of  computer faculties when you're in school, so ...
R: Yeah, they have a -- they also have online colleges --
L:  Right.
R:  -- book studies.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  So that saves you time [LAUGH] on travelling --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- to and from school. [NOISE]
L:  Definitely, that's definitely a good, uh [MN] uh, benefit, too, [inaudible] your home and not have to worry about, uh, traffic or transportation or, you know, sch- -- scheduling, uh, conflicts and that, so it's definitely convenient.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  So have you taken -- do you have a computer?
L:  Um, I -- I actually don't right now, um, in my home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [COUGH] but, I, you know -- I work on a lot of computers in my workplace.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, do you have one or ...?
R:  I do.  I have -- I have a computer --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and that made it easier for us.
L:  Sure, sure.  Um, I'm sure it's totally different, um, having, you know, children, too.  I don't, I'm single so [LAUGH] I suppose if you have someone pretty young you tend to have that sort of good schooling and, um, have that available in your home so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... so, um, well, um, I -- yeah, I would say that it's definitely a -- a good technology and I'm just so glad that we are living in the age where we have computers -- [LAUGH]
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- available to us.  Um, I think it was much harder when everything was handwritten and, um, actually with the, you know -- the advances in technology we could make teaching easier so, uh, definitely -- definitely helps.
R:  It helps, and the only thing that is perhaps a disadvantage to me with a computer is that  you have to go into so many windows --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- to get where you want to be.
L:  Right, I -- right, I agree with that, so, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think I -- it definitely gets much easier once you have, you know, at least [LAUGH] minimal computer skills but when someone is just starting out it's much more difficult, too, so ...
R:  Mhm, 'cause they can be frustrating.
L:  Sure, sure, so ... Um, so I really -- I guess that's what I would say about it, I just feel that it definitely benefits education, um, and I know when I was in school, it wasn't that long ago but I -- we were -- they were just starting to have computers in the classroom and I know even in the last ten years that it's really interesting, the kids -- um, it's really changed with, uh [several inaudible words] you know, the three year olds, they have three year olds working on -- just starting on those computer games and --
R:  Yeah, they have 'em in the headstart classes.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  Playing games on them.
L:  Oh, that's kinda neat if they can learn that young and get started, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ... but it's really a different, uh -- it's really amazing what they can do with -- with young children, um, with computers, so ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yep, it sure is. [NOISE]
L:  So ... I remember, you know, in my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Just saying, three years old and I was, you know, just playing with dolls and things like that --
R:  I know, you --
L:  -- right before they even had computers. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, we spent most of our time outside. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [several inaudible words]. You can see the advantages, though, with the children are -- tend to be so much, uh, more advanced today and, um, it's just they [inaudible] a lot more than I think people did twenty years ago [LAUGH] so --
R:  So we'll have more engineers.
L:  Right, right, definitely, so ...
R:  Architects they can -- they have a big advantage.
L:  Right, right, definitely, so ...
R:  Yeah, and computer programmers.
L:  Oh, definitely, so that's a -- that's a wide open field it seems like so, a lot of -- definitely a lot of, uh, employment in that area, so ...  So, um, where -- what state did you -- are you living in?
R:  Which what?
L:  Oh, I said where -- what state are you living in?
R:  I'm in Georgia.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH] Oh, I'm in Minnesota, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  Well --
R:  Are there a lot of schools out in Minnesota?
L:  Um, yes, they have a lot of colleges up here.  So, are there a lot in Georgia or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Sure, so ...
R:  Some of you never hear of [LAUGH] but the major ones are Georgia State and Clark University and Spelman --
L:  Sure, sure, sure.
R:  -- Georgia Tech --
L:  Sure.  
R:  Arbor[?] University --
L:  Wow.
R:  [MN]
L:  So -- I don't know if you've heard of any up here but we've got the, of course -- the University of Minnesota --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, uh, [inaudible] College, um, Carleton, um, [inaudible] State University, uh, [inaudible] State, so ... and, yeah, [inaudible] so there's actually too many to name. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seems like we have a college in just about every other town up here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so -- which is -- which is great, at least there's a lot of variety for education and a lot of -- there seems to be a lot of programs for, um, getting assistance, you know, financial assistance and, um, things of that nature, too, so that's definitely a good thing.
R:  Okay.  What are the major fields now?
L:  Um, I -- it seems like health care is extremely --
R:  Health care.
L:  -- popular up here. [LAUGH] Uh, I just started going -- you know, even going through the newspapers up here, employment papers, it seems like we have every -- every week it seems like we have pages and pages of health care openings, um, either nursing or, um, things of that nature.  That seems to be a big thing up here.  Um, we also have a lot of, uh, IT, computer jobs, um, information technology seems to be a big field up here, too, so ...
R:  Okay.
L:  What, uh -- what -- what about in -- in your state?
R:  I think they -- most is engineer and computer --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- and, of course, the health field.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Seems to be all over, every -- everyone needs health care so it seems to be a big -- big issue all over.  Then it's like with the, um, average age rising, too, and we're getting so many elderly people, so makes a difference.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  My -- both of my children they just [NOISE] [COUGH] passed on to the -- graduated to the next grade in their elementary school.
L:  Sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, and how is, um -- um, do you feel like -- I don't know, the --
R:  [MN]
L:  I guess the -- the topic of education, do you feel like -- I mean, are you pretty satisfied with the --
R:  With the one that --
L:  -- education or --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, the one that's seven is going to the second grade, [NOISE] his teacher was very thorough. [NOISE] She even gave homework [NOISE] or some of the duplication of the work that they did during the school term for -- and sent them home for us so that we could continue the education over the summer --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- so that he wouldn't forget a lot of stuff.
L:  Oh, that's definitely helpful, sure.
R:  Yeah, and then my other son is right behind him so I'm teaching him the first grade of work 'cause he'll be in first grade when school starts again.
L:  Oh, wow.  That'll be -- that'll be a new experience 'cause he'll be going all day then and so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is he -- is he excited or ...? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so, so ... oh, that's neat, so ...
R:  Yeah.  So they think they're going to be adults real fast.
L:  [LAUGH] Sure, sure, sure. [NOISE]
R:  And --
L:  Well, I, um -- I, like I said I'm single but, um, what I, you know, know --
