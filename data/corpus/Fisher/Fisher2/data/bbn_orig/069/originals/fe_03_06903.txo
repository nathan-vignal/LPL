L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  I'm Cindy.
R:  I'm Sally. [PAUSE] Can you hear me okay?
L:  Yes, I can hear you, can you hear me all right?
R:  Yes.  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I believe the topic, if I understood it, peace in the Middle East, is that correct?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Did you want to go ahead first?
L:  [LAUGH] [SIGH] I don't know if we'll ever get it if we don't get Osama Bin Laden and the other one and the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know g- -- you got to get all the terrorists out before, you know, they're going to get peace because I think they're just going to keep getting attacked like they are now.
R:  Yeah.  I have to agree with you on that.  Um.  I'm not quite sure how the issue can be resolved between the [several inaudible words] or between the Israelis and the Arabs.  And as far as the US um getting involved, I think it has to be more of a world involvement, along with the US.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And definitely it becomes a terrorist, though.
L:  Oh yeah, because you don't know what they're going to do over here, either.
R:  No.  Exactly.
L:  Because they say they've got those terrorist sales over here, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It'd be nice if we could have peace over there, but I don't know, the way it looks and you know, now, you know, we still got people getting -- military getting killed over there.
R:  Uh-huh.  That worries me when they pull them out because I think they still need to be there because we still don't know where Hussein is.
L:  No.  [PAUSE]
R:  I think they need -- still need to concentrate on finding him and then [inaudible] whether Bin Laden is still over there and where --
L:  Mhm.  I think they need to fi- -- you know, Hussein and one of his sons, too.  You know, and Bin Laden, too.  I think they're all behind it all.
R:  Mhm.  And sometimes it seems like it's a just a bit too quiet over here, you wonder if they're plotting something again while we have our guard down.
L:  Uh-huh.  [PAUSE]
R:  Well, it seems we agree on this.  I'm not quite sure now much more you can -- or how to discuss it --
L:  Hm.  [SIGH] I don't either now 'cause it -- I -- it's kind of a hard topic, too, really.
R:  [LAUGH] It is.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yes.
L:  Everybody either has their own viewpoints, but I think yours and ours pretty much go along with each other.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  [PAUSE]
L:  You have any family over there?
R:  Um, no.  I'm fortunate, none of my family is over there.
L:  Mm.
R:  Do you have family over there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, that's even more of a worry.  Are they um serving right in that area?
L:  Two of 'em.  I've got two cousins over there and then I've got one that's special forces and you never know where they're at.
R:  Oh, wow.  Are they able to communicate every so often, just to let you know they're okay?
L:  They c- -- well, they do with their parents and then the parents get a hold of me, so --
R:  Mhm.  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I really admire their b- -- their -- their bravery for -- and also their service for actually going over there --
L:  Really?
R:  Uh.  
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] But --
R:  And how long have they been over there?
L:  Um, the one in special forces he went over --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- right away and then he came back and they sent him back over and then my -- the -- the -- my two cousins are brothers and they sent them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- over about the same time.
R:  Oh, okay.  Now, were they in the Army Reserve, or were they in Army or Air Force?
L:  Um, [SIGH] I'm not e- -- I think Lee's Special Forces in the Air Force --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then the other two are regularly military.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I know it's awful recent to my aunt because the --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- one in Special Forces just had a new baby.  And he --
R:  Oh, [inaudible] --
L:  -- wasn't able to be here for that.
R:  Oh, that's so sad.
L:  So, they're not sure --
R:  So, that's [inaudible] on the whole family.
L:  -- this time -- huh?
R:  What a stress on the whole family.
L:  Yeah.  So, they're not sure this time when he's going to come back.
R:  Yeah.  And do the other two have a time when they might be able to come back?
L:  They haven't really --
R:  Like say are they there for a set time or indefinitely?
L:  They are indefinitely.
R:  Okay.
L:  But what bothers me, you know, something would happen to one brother, you know, that -- you know, two brothers in the same family over there --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- kind of bothers me too.
R:  Yeah.  And what part of the country are you from?
L:  Colorado.
R:  Colorado?  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I live in Minnesota.
L:  Mm.  [SIGH] My ex landlord lived there in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She got a house or something there and then I had a girlfriend that was in [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It's pretty out there.  [PAUSE]
L:  But I'd never heard --
R:  Well, have you ever bee- -- pardon?
L:  Huh?
R:  Have you ever been over to the Middle East before?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, neither have I.  My dad was there years ago and actually in Israel --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I was -- back -- b- -- before I was born, basically, back in the sixties, and he so -- he just did volunteer work over there and it was just slightly more peaceful back then.
L:  Yeah.  But now that even worries me, that the civilian workers over there, because they're talking about taking them hostage again.
R:  Oh really?  Oh.
L:  Mhm.  [SIGH] Because there was something in one of their communiques or something that they're talking about taking the foreigners hostage again.
R:  Mm.
L:  And you never know what's going to happen when they get a hold of them, either.
R:  Uh uh.  No.
L:  So, I'm glad your dad's still isn't over there.
R:  Oh no.  Not -- s- -- this was only for I think a year --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- before he got married, yeah.  But I've always wanted to go visit the area, just to see, but right now --
L:  Um -- I think pulling them out of Saudi Arabia, I don't think they should have pulled them out of there either.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes it seems like they've been pulling the troops -- I know, well, you want the troops to come home to their families --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it needs some of process there.
L:  [SIGH] But when they just go them and moved them out of -- took them completely out of Saudi Arabia and moved the Air Force bases and -- that doesn't sound that good either.
R:  No, no.  No.  And has affected your work at all?
L:  Hm.  I'm looking for work and I can't find anything.
R:  Oh, okay.  Must be a [inaudible].  I work for the airlines.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, um, I think I have a job through the summer, but I don't think it'll [inaudible] after that.
L:  Mhm.  I bet that -- with the nine eleven and everything, I bet that cut down on the travel and the airlines.
R:  Oh yeah.  Quite a bit.
L:  Mm.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And they say every time the -- they put up a new terror alert that when it goes high that people quit flying too.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had a busy weekend last weekend, but in between it's been pretty slow, so we'll see if the summer travel picks up, but again, if there's just one more terrorist thing, it'll all drop down again.
L:  Yeah.  Do they cut -- do they cut -- they have to cut flights and stuff then when the -- when the passengers go down, don't they?
R:  Oh, yeah.  And which they have.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, a lot of the flights are full right now, but it's just 'cause they've cut so many, um, they've downgraded the planes, or cut flights.  So, there's just not as much service.
L:  Mm.  So, I bet that kind of hurts your income when they cut the flights, too?
R:  Um, well, somewhat.
L:  Mm.
R:  Right now, I still work the same amount of hours right now, but probably this -- probably laid off in the fall.
L:  Mm.
R:  Or maybe sooner, if something happens.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  We'll see.  It was interesting though, um, earlier when the troops were going over because we had so many of the planes they took out of passenger service that took the troops over --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and now they're starting to bring some of the troops back.
L:  I didn't think they flew on commercial airlines.
R:  Well, they charter them, so um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so our airline just -- they aren't with the regular passengers, it just becomes an entire military flight --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so just to take all the troops over.
L:  [NOISE] So, where all do you fly to, then?
R:  Um, I'm just based here --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in the City.
