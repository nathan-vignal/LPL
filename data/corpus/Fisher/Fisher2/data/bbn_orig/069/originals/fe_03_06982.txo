L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  How're you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  All right.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm from Chicago.  My name's Katie.  How about you?
R:  Hi Katie.  I'm Jean and I'm from Washington DC.
L:  Hi Jean.
R:  How's everything going?
L:  Pretty good.  How about for you?
R:  All right.  Are you experiencing any weather -- any bad weather or anything?
L:  No.  Pretty nice day.  How -- 
R:  What -- 
L:  -- about yourself?
R:  -- beautiful day?  It's been raining here a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I [several inaudible words] education, dealing with computers?
L:  Yeah.  What do you think about, ah -- what do you think about computers in education? 
R:  Well, I'm all for it, honey -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- after they got rid of those typewriters.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And went with the computers, I'm all for it because, I mean, I'm on the computer every day anyway.  So -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my job involves computers so dealing with computers and setting up a lot of stuff.  So -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that's -- that's basically what I do.  What about you?
L:  I'm a graduate student.  I'm studying linguistics.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, and I teach a little bit too.
R:  Oh, you do?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay, dear.  So -- 
L:  Well, I -- I -- 
R:  -- how much do you use computers then?
L:  Um, I use computers, like, for word processing and I do some internet research, kind of get information, like you know, names and contacts and just to -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- keep up on, um, you know, different kinds of research in the field.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I wouldn't say I use -- I probably don't use the c- computers as much as a lot of people.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I'm using them pretty much every day because my -- I work for the postal service.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and basically, ah, what we do is, I'm always doing a spreadsheet.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm always setting up contacts with someone.  I'm trying -- you know, always emailing and -- 
L:  Right, I like email.
R:  -- all kinds of stuff so definitely -- I'm definitely on the computer.  As a matter of fact, ah, the computer is, ah, I would say eight five percent of my work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I definitely use them.  What do you think about education with the computers, with the children and all of that?
L:  Well, um, I think there's -- pr- probably the, ah, middle ground is, ah, a good idea.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because I think even -- ah, I do think it's important that kids, you know, just like you say, you use computers so much, I think it's important that kids, you know, feel comfortable with computers and can use them to perform different tasks.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I wouldn't want them to -- their teachers to neglect the basics like reading and writing well which you have -- you -- they're skills you need in order to use the computers and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- communicate effectively.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- I wouldn't want to see computer stuff dominate the classroom.
R:  And you know about the computers, um, [several inaudible words] -- the worst thing is when they go down, it's so bad.
L:  It's true -- 
R:  Because you depend on that stuff so many times and I was like, oh, boy, when those computers go down, everybody just say, "Oh, wow".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it -- it -- it's -- it is a sense of if the dependability of the computers, like, oh, boy, and it's just a -- just a computer [COUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Now and the brains in head is -- it can't do anything 'til you tell it to stop putting commands in it.
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  You know, and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's just like, that's just the way of the world.  But, like you say, I want to, don't replace the -- you know, the reading and the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- writing and all of that because we need that kind of stuff.
L:  Yeah, I mean -- 
R:  We definitely need that kind of stuff but educational, ah, and you know, you -- do you know why?  I don't now how in the hell you are but when [several inaudible words], you know when you went to the library you used to pull a little library card.
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  You find a card -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you went up there and you found your book -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Well, you know, nothing is that way anymore.
L:  No -- 
R:  Everything -- 
L:  -- uh-huh.
R:  -- is computerized so everything has a [several inaudible words], a little this, a little that -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you know, and you got to go sign your thing by that.  So -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, all the things that we used to do, oh, no, it's not -- it's nothing like that anymore.
L:  That's very true.
R:  You're right.  It's nothing like that so, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, how -- how do -- how do you deal with, ah, ah -- and -- and dealing with, ah, when you teach?
L:  Well, I tell ya, one danger of the computer is that I had this personally happen in my classroom.  You know, I asked my students to write a short paper and, ah, you know, at least one of my students, and I caught her but, you know, she -- she found a paper on the internet and she -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- tried to turn it in as her own work.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that's -- that's no good at all.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly -- 
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And that's what I -- that can -- that's a lot of problem that I see.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Children getting stuff off the internet and turning it in like it's their paper.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have not done anything when you have turned other people's work in.
L:  That's exactly -- 
R:  People -- 
L:  -- right.
R:  Exactly.  People are trying to look at -- you know, not so much to get the A. but what have you learned -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you can -- you know, that you can [inaudible] this and this is my work -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and doing someone else's work is not the -- the -- that's not -- that's not the answer we're looking for to that -- 
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  And you're right.  That's what they do.  They surf their way, and they'll find -- and I -- how -- how -- I mean, you can -- I -- I wonder how many more people have turned in -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- papers off the web.
L:  And just not gotten caught.
R:  You see what I'm saying?
L:  That's right.
R:  I'm telling you.  That -- that's not good at all.
L:  No, it -- it's -- 
R:  I agree, [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  -- the danger.
R:  But, what was the -- what was the answer that they gave when, ah, you asked them about it.  Did they make like it was their paper?
L:  You know what?  This woman, she really made a bad choice.  Um, she -- the paper she turned in, it was on -- ah, she found a -- this was funny.
R:  Okay.
L:  Sh- she found some, like, It- Italian linguists -- ah, linguists in Italy who did their research on a topic related to something we talked about in class.
R:  Okay.
L:  But, it was at a much more advanced level that anything, ah, I thought -- I knew she would be able to do -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- based on how we covered the material.  I mean -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we just talked about it a little bit and we did not go into nearly as much depth that would justify, you know, this level of paper.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And she said to me -- ah, no, she admitted it right away.  Um, yeah, there was no way she could fake it out. 
R:  Right.  Right -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.  [several inaudible words] Well at least she admitted it because you get some of them that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- say, "I don't know what you're talking about --" 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I wrote this paper".  Well, you know, ah --" 
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's no way.  You can tell -- you -- you pretty much know your students.
L:  That's right.
R:  You really -- 
L:  You do.
R:  -- can.  You pretty much know your students.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what they're capable of doing -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and what they're not capable of doing.
L:  Right.
R:  And in something like that I just can't see, you know, you thinking that you're going to get credit for something you didn't do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know and that -- that -- that -- you know, you're right.  That computer -- and -- and -- and -- I'm going to tell you, not only that but com- computers can destroy a lot of things.  What they put on that internet today -- 
L:  That's true.  It's dangerous.
R:  -- that -- that stuff is terrible.  I'm telling you, that stuff I see sometimes, and I'm like, they don't need it.  And like you say, the parents are they -- are they really monitoring what those children are watching on it and -- and doing on the computer?
L:  That's a good point.  I mean -- 
R:  I mean, really?
L:  -- just -- it -- it -- some of those kids and -- you know people solicit children over the internet and -- 
R:  That's what I'm saying, it -- 
L:  Ah, it's really very dangerous.
R:  And [several inaudible words] you don't know anything until this happens and then it -- you're like, "How did it happen to me?"  Well, you know what?  If you don't monitor -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and know what your children is doing -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then you -- you're subject to them doing anything.
L:  Right.
R:  And you have -- you've got to be just as wise as the kids today.  I'm -- 
L:  Wiser.  Yeah.
R:  -- saying and you want to have -- that's true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you're going to have to know exactly what they're capable of doing -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- a- -- just like anything else, like you said, you know your students.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You got to know your children.
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  'Cause I mean if you don't, believe me, they can get away with a lot of things and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if your mind is not up there so willing to learn those things -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they can -- they can pull a lot of wool over your eyes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- 
L:  That's right.
R:  -- that's why I say computers, they're good in a sense but they have their bad things in a sense too.
L:  Right.  It's -- 
R:  They're -- 
L:  -- a mixed bag.
R:  That's correct.  That's -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- correct.  I agree with ya.  I -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- definitely agree with ya so -- 
L:  And sometimes, you know, teachers will give students homework, like research this on the internet and you know, if done correctly it can be helpful.  But, sometimes another problem is that people can put all kinds -- not only just dangerous, like, pornography or unsuitable material, but sometimes even the research -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- there's good research and bad research.
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE] --  
L:  So, sometimes there's a -- a higher quality you find in books because they get edited and they get reviewed but some of the stuff that goes up on the internet, you know, anybody can throw that stuff up there.
R:  And you know what?  You are so right when you say that because you know what?  All the stuff on the internet is not true.
L:  Mhm.
R:  All that stuff that people put on the internet -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is not true.
L:  That's right.
R:  And people look at it like, "Oh, well, that's true --" 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  "-- because, you know, they wouldn't have put that on the website if it wasn't".  Oh, yes, they do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You would not believe the stuff that comes across that website and you say, "Oh, now where did that come from?"
L:  That's right.
R:  'Cause people -- they -- like you say, they're forming their own internet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're doing -- they -- you know, they -- they're setting it up themselves and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everything on that internet is not true.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  That's true.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  And like -- like you said, unless you research that stuff and know for a fact -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you -- you're not -- you can't trust anything on that -- on that internet.
L:  No, you can't.
R:  And I agree -- look -- and I'm -- look, that's one point I definitely agree with you.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I truly agree with that.  But, like you say, people just -- some people just think just because it's written -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's supposed to be true -- 
L:  [MN] That's what's so terrible -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] --  
R:  And I had to agree.  Uh-uh, that it doesn't -- [several inaudible words] told you that, just because people lie.  And a lot of people just think because they're off the line, everything's supposed to be true.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, take the newspaper -- 
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- they print stuff that's inaccurate all the time.
R:  Thank you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Thank you.  And just like they'll go -- I -- I've seen too many newscasts now, they'll go out and get a story.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And what they'll do is they'll take their story, they don't have the basic or the facts -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just somebody says something and they say, "Well, I got it from my [inaudible]"  Now they go -- go put it on the computer, and they put -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and everybody believes in that rot.  Nobody really tends to want to get the facts anymore.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because you know remember on Dragnet or something he used to do, "Just give me the facts".  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah --
