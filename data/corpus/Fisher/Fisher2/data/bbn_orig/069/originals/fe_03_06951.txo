R:  Katherine.
L:  My name is Ingeborg but call me Ingrid 'cause it's too difficult.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.  Did she say, uh, do computers improve education?
R:  [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE]
L:  Yes.
R:  I believe they do.
L:  Well, go right ahead.
R:  Okay, um, I am [NOISE] a grad student and --
L:  [NOISE] Oh god, I'm going to kill my dog.  Savannah, get in the bedroom.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, do every --
L:  In bedroom.
R:  Do everything on line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I don't have to go into a classroom which is really good --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, um, have a kindergartener --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who has finished lessons on computers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know, learn -- has learned a lot about, you know, the computer and the computer age --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is done with computers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now so I think it's vital that we learn how to use a computer.
L:  Well, now let me see.  You're pretty young, uh, I'm going to be eighty two this month and I've had a lot of education [LAUGH] but none on computers.
R:  Right.
L:  I've lived in three --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- countries and, uh, so I speak several languages and, um, my children, of course, know about computers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and they're into computers --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, when I want to find out something then I call my daughter, Melissa --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I say, "Melissa, look this and this up for me", you know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I, myself, though --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- don't have one.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I hear a little girl.
R:  [NOISE] Right, yep. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Um, yeah in [NOISE] -- I know like my father, he's elderly you know and we got him a computer and he likes to play chess on it.
L:  Well, I tell you something.  Uh, [COUGH] my father tried to teach me chess but it's not -- just not my kind of thing, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  No.  No, I wouldn't have minded having a computer and I had a boarder and he had two computers --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know but, um, I think it's great to have computers but I think, and they have found out, that some of the skills that children develop, uh, as they get older do -- do not come from computers and if you only use the computer you lose those.  Like children used to put things together a lot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and that's a very important skill [NOISE] and somehow they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They feel that if you use computers a lot then you miss out on that skill, you see.
R:  That's right.  Um --
L:  Um, go ahead.
R:  Oh yeah, I know, like, uh, in North Carolina they have, um, one school that's just --
L:  You're from North Carolina?
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  My husband was from South Carolina.  He said --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- there is no such thing as North Carolina --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- only upper South Carolina.
R:  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- there's one school that's just totally computerized --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and they have -- [MN] every thirty minutes they have to stop and read out of a book, out of literature, for twenty minutes.
L:  Oh, god.
R:  So they work thirty minutes on the computer and then they stop and then they read so they don't lose that on hand reading skills --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but their test scores are the highest of the state because things are explained better on the computer and they're able to, um, interact with it, you know, and see, like, their test scores immediately --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and see what they did wrong and all that so, I mean, I think it's interesting but they do have to -- you know, like you said, they do have to be able to put things together themselves and do the manual work.
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well I know that -- that my kids, well I -- I just lost one of my daughters in November --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, both of my kids skipped and they were very, very -- doing extremely well in school and I think, uh -- and this has nothing to do with computers so I'll make it fast, when -- by the time my children were two months old I was reading to them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then I sang to them in different languages and they -- I mean, I think you have to start with children very, very early.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  The earlier the better.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.
L:  But this is why I'm so disturbed that now in New York they're cutting the pre -- the pre kindergarten classes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because if -- if you have parents who have time that's fine but what if both parents work, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  They've got to get this from someone --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's -- yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Now I have a friend, well she's a little younger than I, and she has a computer and she enjoys it very much because she loves to look up things and cultures, you know, different cultures and whatever and, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm sure that I wouldn't have any trouble learning it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, but I have so many other things that --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  That interest me, you know, and I -- I still teach two choruses, senior choruses, and, um, when I have time I read, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  And I live right near the Botanical Garden --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, the Bronx Botanical Garden so I go there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What's your little girl's name?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, Kaitlyn.
L:  Kaitlyn?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And how old is she?
R:  [NOISE] She is eighteen months.
L:  Eighteen months, uh?
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  That's nice sounds she makes.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you sing to her?
R:  Uh, yeah, but she doesn't like it because mommy cannot sing. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's too bad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How about daddy?
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, I think, you know, um, education is so important and I'm willing to give our daughter [NOISE] -- our oldest daughter, you know, every advantage that --
L:  You have more than one daughter?
R:  Uh-huh.  We have two. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um, if I can teach her more on the computer because I know more about it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then I think -- I think she benefits.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [MN]
L:  Look, in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The thing is, if you're a communicator, you know -- I know some people who are very bright --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but they don't communicate [LAUGH] with their children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  I'm a communicator, that's what makes me a good teacher.
R:  Right.
L:  Anything I knew, that's -- uh, my daughter's first grade teacher once said to me, "Mrs Taylor, Melissa made a report about the botanical garden but after a while I had to stop her because she had all these Latin names and the kids got [LAUGH] very bored", you know.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- chil- -- and -- and another thing is if I didn't know it I would say, "Let's look it up" --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so then my children started very early to look things up --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- you know, so that was good.
R:  Yeah, and I think, um, one good thing about, like, the internet or, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know, in school and stuff and doing homework or doing research papers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's readily there, you know.  I mean, you --
L:  Oh, I think that's wonderful.
R:  You can just --
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, you know, like, say, if you didn't know anything about the botanical gardens you can just put it in a search engine and pull it up and you have [NOISE] you know, a lot of documents to choose from and you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can compile them and write a report that way, you know, and --
L:  So, you work from home a lot, uh?
R:  Right, yes.
L:  Well, that's very good.  I know a lot of people who work from home with compu- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Computers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I think for me and my family, I think, um, computers in education are the best way because, you know -- 'cause it is a computerized world. [NOISE]
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  You know, and --
L:  Yes, it is. [SIGH]
R:  Everything's -- [MN] we're becoming a paperless world and, you know, everyone [MN] --
L:  Well, that would be good for the trees, you know.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  If that could get -- get -- get that way, you know, I mean, that far advanced and stuff but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, this is very interesting because you're obviously very young.  I mean, but I -- I don't know exactly how old you are --
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  -- but, uh, as far as I'm concerned, you're very young --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  -- you know, yeah.
R:  Yeah, so ... but --
L:  Yeah, well my, um -- I wouldn't mind having a computer, I really would not mind having one, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because, uh, I like looking things up, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a very good tool to have.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, you can't cook without a frying pan so, in today's world, you know, you can't hardly -- almost you can't, uh, learn without a computer, you know, it --
L:  Oh yeah, you can cook with a -- with the whatchamacallit -- uh, what is it called?  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Not the stove, the other thing, the one where you just push buttons?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, the microwave.
L:  The microwave, yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [LAUGH] it's not good home cooked food --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, [LAUGH] so ... [NOISE]
L:  What's the matter with her?  She's bored.
R:  Mhm, yep.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I don't know how many minutes we have left. [NOISE]
L:  I have no idea.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't think we have a lot left --
R:  [NOISE] So, um --
L:  -- because last time it went so fast.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Kaitlyn?
R:  Mhm, Kaitlyn. [NOISE]
L:  Kaitlyn, how do you write that?
R:  How do you write it? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] K.A.I.T.L.Y.N.
L:  +Kaitlyn, oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  What's she saying?
R:  Oh, "Daddy".
