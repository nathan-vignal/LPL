L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Ah, my name's Kathy Verner[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Annie [LAUGH].
L:  Hi Annie.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Temple I mean, where I do live, in New Jersey, ah, outside of Philly.
R:  Okay.  I live in New York City.
L:  Oh, another person's who's close.
R:  Yes.
L:  To ah --
R:  Um, have you done any of these other ones before?
L:  Just one.  It is swish, it was going to be education and since I'm in educational reform, I thought that'd be fun.  But they changed it to being, feeling a threat from another country.
R:  Right.
L:  So.  Where do you want to go from here?
R:  [LAUGH] This is my lunch break, um --
L:  You don't want to do anything, is that what it is, 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH] Um, I don't know what -- what do you think?
L:  Ah, what do I think?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, --
R:  I --
L:  -- about this country feeling a threat from any other country?  The country will tell you what they want to tell you and if -- if there's not a threat they'll make it sound like there is one, I think just to get public opinion to support --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- certain things like Patriot Act One and Two and other aggressive type behaviors toward countries.
R:  Right.  I don't think that -- yeah, I don't see a specific threat from any country, I see it um [LIPSMACK] more from, you know, countries maybe being grounds for harboring terrorists but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't think that um any organization, you know, any government, any other country really wants to do something to the US specifically --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, it's more individual.  I don't know.  So, I guess that's the way I see it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um.
L:  We've got to talk for ten minutes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, oh and ten minutes out of your lunchtime, I'm so sorry.
R:  No, it's fine.  No, don't, no, I meant it more that -- that I wanted to do it, but I was like, "Oh, great this -- this is not something I want to talk about right now" [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] the topic either.
R:  Um, but yeah, that -- that really is the way I see it, though, I guess.  An- -- and I do --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have faith in my government and believe them when they say that there's, you know, legitimate threats.  I do have faith in intelligence, especially because part of the reason why September eleventh happened is because there was a lapse in our intelligence and they knew Bin Laden was out there and they missed the moment --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, um, you know, I think they're really trying to cover themselves and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, any small lead they have, you know, they're going to --
L:  Do you think they're being hyper sensitive about it all?
R:  Um, I think they are, but I think the reality is that these threats existed before September eleventh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we just didn't know because they were thwarted.  So, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I do have faith that they're not just, you know, trying to scare Americans, um --
L:  I don't know.
R:  But I definitely don't think it, you know, the threats come from any specific country.
L:  Mm.
R:  More rogue, you know, individuals.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, that's not to say that I think that like our country is one hundred percent in the way we've handled it, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you have faith that, you know, they're not lying to us, I guess.
L:  Oh, you have more faith than I have.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well I used to, you know, my sister used to distort reality --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is the same thing as lying, it's just a nicer way to -- to describe it because ah maybe the intention to actually deceive is different but from the perspectives of some people they have such weird perspectives on the way things are supposed to be and what's dangerous and what's not and what's real and what's not and I don't know, just because someone else says something doesn't make me a believer.
R:  Well, of course not.  I've just -- I've just read, you know, a fair amount --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um on it and I also think that they distort things for trying to form a more cohesive agenda --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that will reach out to a broader audience like you know going right from Bin Laden and then drawing a conclusion, or drawing a connection to um Hussein --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and kind of, you know, um galvanizing people toward that cause.  I think that was distorted.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, and he kind of moved on from that once, you know, it was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- clear that we were going to war.  He kind of dropped Bin Laden.  But he did kind of, you know, he tried to form an initial connection between the two in order to, you know, to move in that direction.  So, I think that that's a distortion --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but I don't necessarily think that the threats that he saw were distorted --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I mean, I definitely -- I definitely think they distort, you know, the way they motivate the country, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I still have faith that it's grounded in -- in some fact, you know.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I guess I was like I didn't want to see them do the -- do the war thing because I mean everything that involved from human life to economics just seemed to be a big waste for ah, you know, what they were going to accomplish and they still haven't really found the weapons of mass destruction that they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they said were there.
R:  Right.
L:  And, like you said with terrorists, I mean they could just move around.
R:  And I -- and I -- again, consistent with what I said before, I think that -- that was a problem with their, like, diplomacy --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- or a problem with the way that they galvanized people, or, you know, behind this war like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it kind of -- I don't think that was the right point they should have emphasized.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now it's, you know, kind of coming back to you know kick 'em in the -- in the face because --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they haven't found anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, so I think they took the wrong approach.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, --
L:  Yeah, taking --
R:  But I -- I also think that, you know, I think that the terror alerts are kind of stupid --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- but ah -- but, you know, some of my friends have argued that like it's all, you know, trying to -- to instill fear in the people and it's this whole conspiracy that's going on and -- and my argument as far as that is New York City, I mean the City has absolutely no money right now.  Why --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- would money, you know, and granted, the government is probably subsidizing much of it, or the Federal Government, why would they be spending money like having police out, you know, forming blockades in front of Madison Square Garden, or the helicopters around like, why would they be wasting their time on that, you know, or their money on that if it were really, you know, completely fabricated?
L:  Well, you know, [MN] it -- it doesn't take much to do a lot of damage.  And ah like you know, I don't know if a lot of the p- -- I mean, sure, the proportions might, you know, ah thwart some efforts --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- but if somebody really wanted to, you know, to -- to wreak havoc and to wreak destruction, I think they could do it.
R:  I agree.  I agree that they're futile.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think -- I think that all that stuff is a waste of time.  I just don't think -- I just think of it like as a little bit more legitimacy of the fact that there probably are sincere threats going on and it's not some sort of conspiracy.
L:  Mm.
R:  Because why would they waste the time doing it?  But I do think it's futile, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I feel the same way when I get on an airp- airplane and someone's checking my shoes and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- doing all that, like I mean, if someone's going to do it, they're -- they're going to do it, you should have stopped them at the borders, not --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- right now, walking into an airport, you know.
L:  Well, have you heard at the airports like because I've been flying a little bit lately, you know, look around you, see if there's anybody suspicious.  I mean, don't you think that just in- increases a sense of paranoia?
R:  Of -- yes, I do.  I do think that.  I do think that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, I -- as I said, they -- they missed -- they missed, you know, September eleventh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they -- they knew about it, like they just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- missed the date.  And so I mean, yeah, hey it's paranoia, but they're also probably, you know, trying to -- to gain some ground that they lost.
L:  Mm.
R:  They don't want to be blamed for something again and so instead of --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know what I mean?  Instead of blaming a lapse of intelligence, they're going to be like, "Whoa, we're going to be on top of everything".
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, try to warn people when something's going on, so that if something happens it's, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- not necessarily all reflected poorly upon the intelligence.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't know.  I mean, there's a fine line, of course, between making f- you know, talking about duck tape, I mean, come on --
L:  Mhm.  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It just you know, I remember when September eleventh happened.  I -- it was just so fantastic.  I couldn't -- I just couldn't believe, you know, I didn't believe it.
R:  Right.
L:  That it actually happened.
R:  Right.  I know.
L:  Any other comments about the countries?  Because that's supposed to be the topic [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Not really.
L:  No.
R:  Um, no.
L:  Why --
R:  I really don't see big threats.
L:  -- identify ah a country, a whole country to, you know, I mean in your mind, the -- the -- how did it affect you, that he just identified a whole country to -- to you know aggress against and clean up, whatever that meant?
R:  Um, I mean it bothers me, to be honest.
L:  Mm.
R:  But unfortunately the people who are the players involved, you know, are seen as symbols of the country, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, when he's talking about these things, he's not addressing the larger nation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] addressing whoever's in charge.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  A lot of people, both sides died, that was just unnecessary, to me, it seemed.  And I don't know, economics seems to play a big, big part in any -- any decisions that, you know, especially political.
R:  Of course.
L:  What do you think about Bush's chances of getting reelected?  I mean, I'm really curious about that.
R:  God, I -- see, I don't know enough about the other candidates right now.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um, I'd say that they're probably pretty high.
L:  You're kidding?  That scares me.
R:  I know.  I voted for [inaudible] last election, so --
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, shamefully, I didn't vote.
R:  I think there should be more choices.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do.
L:  I mean --
R:  Um, but yeah, I think he probably stands a pretty good chance.
L:  Oh, that's scary.  You know, I heard someone say that ah -- of course it was at a -- a peace ra-
