L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Marcie.
L:  I'm Debbie.
R:  Hi, Debbie.  What do you think?
L:  Um, I think computers help with education.
R:  [MN] I do, too, but I do not -- I am not in favor of using computers before the fifth grade.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think that kids need to develop their other skills and their problem solving abilities without immediately going to the computer.  How do you feel about it? [LAUGH]
L:  Um, that sounds like a good idea but I have a young child and he has learned to use the computer at an early age and I have found that in some areas it has helped him to grow.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just -- I -- I guess I -- I just feel that I see so many children spending so much time in front of the computer or with handheld video games or a lot of electronic games and not being able to use their imagination and amuse themselves, so to speak.  They -- they seem to need that electronic stimuli and I guess that bothers me.
L:  Yeah, that's a -- that's a good point.  Um, I do -- I do see a lot of kids that do not have much imagination, that sit and play the video games and play a lot so, I mean, I think it does take away from the imagination but, um, I still think that computers have helped, that -- I don't know, I just believe that they help in education.
R:  Well, you know, like I said, I -- I certainly am not not in favor of computers, uh, at all.  I mean, I -- I think that the computer is -- is a wonderful thing and, as a matter of fact, I spend quite a bit of time on one myself. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess I just feel like with -- with young children that they -- they shouldn't get so much of their, uh, entertainment from, um, TV and from movies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and cartoons and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- video games and everything.  I think they should be out developing social skills and -- and motor skills, too.
L:  Right.  Well, I guess the thing is, um, some of the games that he has, one of 'em --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was about one of the presidents on a, um, excursion --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was just really interesting because that way it gave us other questions to look up and to research --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about the President Roosevelt and whenever he went on his safari excursions and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it was really interesting because he -- it was the Amazon and it was just really interesting because he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- went to school talking about it and just, you know, understood things that I would have never thought to teach him at --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- six years old, so --
R:  Well --
L:  And then, like, he has several paint and so he does use his imagination on those games and I guess I believe I do not buy him play games for the computers, I play him educational games for the computers.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, well, I think that's -- I think that certainly is the way to go.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm, uh, really kind of off the wall here in the fact that, you know, I'm -- I'm so against children watching TV and -- and that sort of thing and -- and I guess, you know, it just -- I just feel like -- now, when I say I'm against them watching TV, I -- I -- I certainly am not against the child watching an educational, uh, you know, sort of a something on TV like, um, you know, something about China or -- or something that they're maybe --
L:  Right.
R:  They have an interest in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I -- I just -- I guess I'm just really getting very -- very, um, angry and -- and very concerned about the stuff that's being put out for kids now that -- it's so violent --
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's horrible.
R:  -- and it's so awful --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, this -- this movie, uh, by the name of Jackass which, of course, I have not seen but I have certainly read all about it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is -- it just proves my point.  We have had four youngsters, you know, in their early pre teens and early teens, four in the last seven weeks, three have been killed and one was seriously, seriously injured --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- trying to perform one of those stunts --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they saw on that movie so when these -- when these movie pe- -- you know, people tell us that, "Oh well, the kids -- the kids know that this is just pretend.  They -- they know that it's not real", I don't believe that.
L:  No.
R:  You know, and what a tragedy for a parent to -- to lose one of their children over something so ridiculous and stupid, uh --
L:  Yeah, my husband and I had watched an episode of that on TV and I -- I just could not believe it and, yes, if I was a child watching that, you know, some of those stunts, I'm sure kids would want to try.
R:  Sure.
L:  You know, some of them looked funny because those people are cracking up laughing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and here they're hurt but they're still laughing --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because they're, I think, not right in the head but, um -- yeah, so the kids think, "Oh, that was a funny stunt", you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  "They got hurt but they must not really be hurt 'cause they're laughing" so --
R:  Exactly.
L:  It -- yeah, it's -- it's not -- definitely not -- and you sit down and watch a regular family show on TV and then you have to go to the commercials --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the commercials are horrible.
R:  That's true, too.
L:  And I thought, well, that's awful, you can't even watch a family show --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- without the commercials being awful.
R:  No, I -- I totally agree with you and I -- I just think that the parents need to hold these people that are making these films and these commercials and everything, I think they need to be sent a clear message that they are harming our children --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and our children are -- are being hurt and even killed, uh, from the things that they are seeing and it's -- it's totally irresponsible, you know.
L:  Yeah, I signed --
R:  I -- I just --
L:  I signed up with a program that you buy videos from them and they're trying to get violence out of television.
R:  Oh, that's so positive.
L:  Yes, it -- it -- it's really nice 'cause I've bought -- bought a couple of their videos and it -- it's really nice because the videos aren't boring, they're fun --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're -- and the kids, if you don't tell them, they don't know any difference, it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's no violence in the videos so ...
R:  Yeah, I just -- I just don't think that -- that kids can get -- you know, even, you know, even before there was all the videos and all the everything like that hype --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, you know, it was very, very hard for kids not to get that nothing could ever happen to them.  I think that's part of the nature of being a young person is feeling that you are invincible --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it couldn't possibly happen to you and then, when they see all this stuff out there, I think it gives them just even more --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a false sense of, "Oh yes, I can do that and it would be very, very funny and everyone would laugh and nothing will ever happen to me".
L:  Yeah.  Well, getting back to the computers, I have a fourteen year old that went over to his dad's house and decided to do his homework on the computer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- now that he's on the internet, and you have no idea.  I checked his email and found some sites that he went to out of curiosity because someone at school told him about this site --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I told him, I said, "There's things in that computer that you should never ever see in your lifetime --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- let alone at fourteen years old". 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he's like, "Mom, it just scared me so bad".  He said, "I shut the computer off and swore I'd never go back to it" but since he went to it then they start sending him emails --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to his email account so I had to go in and shut that down.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  It was awful.  I mean, there were -- there were sites that had dead people and actual videos and -- and it was just horrible.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Horrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he said it really scared even -- you know, he swore he wouldn't go back on it and so, you know, he was grounded from the internet for a long, long time. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I don't blame you.  That is frightening.
L:  But his dad thought he was doing homework --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had no idea -- no idea that he would go to a site like that and I thought --
R:  And that's just a --
L:  -- there has to be supervision.
R:  -- natural, normal kid --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sort of thing to do.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.  I mean, there isn't a kid in the whole world that isn't curious and isn't going to say --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- "Oh wow, look at that", you know.
L:  Yeah, and he admitted that those images stayed with him, you know --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- after seeing them on there, he admitted that they -- they stayed with him.
R:  Well, you know, I --
L:  So ...
R:  I definitely -- and I -- I think that it's -- I think it's very hard for a lot of parents, especially if there are multiple children, to monitor what each and every child is bringing up on their computer.
L:  Right.
R:  I know, on my own computer, I get pop ups of spam all the time --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that, uh, you know -- I mean, I -- I've not -- you know, I just didn't fall off the turnip truck, you know, I've been around the block but, um, I'm offended by the nature of -- of these things.  It doesn't shock me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it angers me --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think, you know, who in the world is sending me this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now -- and if you go in and they say -- you know, go in and try to get off -- uh, your name off that list, then you -- all they do is take your name and sell it to more of the same.
L:  Yes, I know, yes.
R:  So for kids, uh, I just -- I just think it's a very, very tough thing to ask parents to have to do, you know, to monitor one more thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, with -- with kids and computers and schools and everything like that.  Now I don't think that there's anything -- when I said, you know, past fifth grade --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I certainly do realize that kids past fifth grade can -- can get into a lot of things, too, over their head but I -- I just kind of feel like before fifth grade they should be out developing their imagination, playing with their friends, uh, you know, reading books, uh, doing --
