L:  Hi.  My name is Louise and I'm near Montreal.
R:  Hi, Louise.  I'm Jane Charman and I'm near Baltimore.
L:  Oh, wow.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  [MN] Oh good, thank you.
R:  Good.
L:  And the topic of the day is computer?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, I don't know so -- I think it's good for --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, education.
R:  I -- I think there's benefits, definitely to, um, having computers.  Um, I used to teach --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and we had computers in the classroom and it --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- certainly was very beneficial in many ways.  Um, I can see some downsides to it but definitely more -- more benefits than -- than downsides.
L:  Yeah, mhm.  Like I have two kids that, uh -- one is still at school, he's seventeen, the younger -- youngest one and, uh, when he's doing a research it's so easy with the computer --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and with the internet --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- for -- to have the information.  Now -- now he's doing research on poetry, wow, he's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- having all the biography and all the poems that the writer wrote, it's all on the internet.
R:  That's true.  It's -- it's wonderful, it's a wonderful tool.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I have a seventeen year old son, too [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, wow. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, we find that, too.  The research, it makes it so much easier --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, having that, um [LIPSMACK] -- you know, that ability to spell check and to, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it certainly makes it much easier.  I think it's easier on the teachers, too, because when the kids can use the computer as a tool to type their work ... I know there's been research that, uh -- that shows that, um, handwriting -- uh, teachers do tend to grade those who write better --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- more neatly, higher than those who do not --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- who have poorer handwriting and in many cases kids, you know, their hand coordination is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not so good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that can be a -- a problem and this way it kind of equals the playing field --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which is a nice benefit.
L:  Wow.  And, uh, on the downside, it's the, like -- I don't know, uh, if we can call this a computer but you know the things to make, uh, the, um, addition and the +subtraction and everything --
R:  Yeah, the mathematics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I go to the supermarket and the little girl at the cash, with the cash, doesn't know how much change she have to give me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She doesn't know how to count the change.
R:  That's true.  That -- that is one of the downsides to it.
L:  I give her, uh, twenty dollar for, let's see, eleven eighty seven and it's eight thirteen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but if it's not written eight thirteen she doesn't know --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- how much to give me so I teach her the other day.  I say, "Okay, eleven eighty seven, count eighty eight, eighty nine, ninety, twelve and you give me a dollar".  "Oh, that's easy".  She didn't -- she didn't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Nobody teach her that so ...
R:  I find that with my own children as well, I've seen some of that come from using the computer and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and that is a problem.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  You know, I guess you can look at it in two ways.  They can always count on that because they're so easily accessible now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but how much do you really want your children using -- relying so much on --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R: -- that, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I -- I -- I agree, that's the downside to it.
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  But, um, definitely I know when I was in, um, school, in graduate school, I was in the library every weekend looking for information and the fact that my children can do that from home now --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- it just makes it so much easier, although they still complain about how much work they have to do and I keep telling them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Hey, you have no idea". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  You used to be a teacher?
R:  I did, I was a teacher. 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  I taught, um, high school, middle school and elementary school --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- at different times but, yeah, we use the computers a lot and I think they're very motivational.  I think kids, um, you know, enjoy --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- using them --
L:  That's it, it --
R:  -- and I think kids are actually in many cases more proficient than their teachers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The one downside to it, I think, in education is it's very hard for them to keep up with the technology in terms of expense.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  So, um, I think it's a great tool but I think that in some cases they're relied on too much and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- too much of our money is being funneled into areas that, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we -- we can't afford.
L:  Mhm.  But, uh, I don't know, it -- maybe it will slow down --
R:  Yeah, I think that's starting --
L:  -- [LAUGH] eventually.
R:  I think that is starting to happen, I think that's a good point, I do, I think you're --
L:  Yeah, because you can improve, improve, improve but, uh, eventually, uh, we going to reach the top, I -- I hope.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, no I agree with you, that's a very good point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  How did you learn about the Fisher study?
R:  How --
L:  On your computer? [LAUGH]
R:  Actually I belong to a group called, uh, Money and Shopping --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and we do, um, you know, like undercover shopping.
L:  Yeah, uh, I, on the Lila's Lounge.  Uh, uh, it's a -- it's a group, yeah, or groups --
R:  Okay.
L:  It's -- uh, Money and Shopping.  You should -- I think you have heard of Lila's Lounge?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm on that, um --
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  I'm looking at the [LAUGH] -- I'm doing some mystery shopping here and I'm doing -- I'm looking at this, um, group because I cannot, uh, contribute because we -- here it's not the same thing as in the State, it's not, uh --
R:  Where -- where are you?
L:  I'm near Montreal.
R:  Oh, you did say that.  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do -- I work with a lot of people up in that area.
L:  Okay.
R:  I work in the health industry as well in, um, supplements and I work with a lot of people up in that area.
L:  Okay.
R:  In fact, I just got off the phone, right before this call started. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So ...
L:  Well, I was typing a report when the phone call [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  The phone rang. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  That's great.
L:  I'm doing merchandising and, uh --
R:  Oh, very good.
L:  -- a little bit of the mystery shopping, too. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  It's a nice second little, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- business to have, which is nice.
L:  Yeah, well primarily I -- before I was doing, uh, bookbinding --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and book restoration --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it's not something that you can, uh, put butter on your bread with that because it's not, uh --
R:  Very lucrative?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's not every people that, uh, need a book to be +rebound --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so there's not --
R:  Well, now that -- now that we have computers -- [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.
R:  -- everything's on the computer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so the market is low on this field --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, uh, that's how I begin to do merchandising to, uh, be a little more lucrative.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Mm.
R:  Now, where are you originally from?
L:  Where I what?
R:  Where are you originally from?
L:  Oh, it's, uh, Il Tahoe[?].  It's about twenty miles, uh, west of, uh, Montreal.
R:  And you're -- you came from there originally?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.  Do you have -- what other language do you speak?
L:  French.
R:  I was -- yeah, I knew you had some other background.
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's wonderful.  I forget about Canada having the French language as well sometimes, because every time I speak to someone they're speaking English --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, um -- but, you primarily --
L:  Well, I'm most --
R:  Do you primarily speak French?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, yeah, I must have a big accent in -- in English, no?
R:  Yes, you do --
L:  You --
R:  -- have an accent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I couldn't figure out which accent it was.  We were, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in France not too long ago and it's a little --
L:  Oh, it's --
R:  Little different.
L:  Oh, no, it's not the same.  They -- they don't have the same accent.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's worse [LAUGH] than --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's stronger than ours [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because we speak -- we speak a lot of English here.
R:  I would think you'd have to.
L:  Oh yes, oh yes, uh, um --
R:  But within your home you'd speak primarily French?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, uh, my oldest son he just finished, um, college --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, he was in an English college.  He went to school in English --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, my youngest is, uh -- he's in French.
R:  Now, uh, when you say he went to college and they spoke primarily English, is that in your area --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or did he leave your area?
L:  No, no, in my area.
R:  Okay.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And what did he study?
L:  Um, administration.
R:  Very good.
L:  Business, mhm.
R:  Now, is he still in school or is he finished?
L:  He just finished now.  He's in the training --
R:  Wonderful.
L:  -- for three weeks and after that, uh, he have to find himself -- himself a job.
R:  Wonderful.  Now, how old is --
L:  So he's going to leave the nest [LAUGH]. He's twenty two.
R:  Oh, twenty two.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And your youngest is seventeen?
L:  Yes.  And you have one boy or ...?
R:  I have one boy and one girl --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and my seventeen year old has, uh, one more year of school, high school --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and then we're starting to look at colleges.
L:  Oh.
R:  And my daughter is in her -- she just finished her first year of high school so she has three more years.
L:  Oh.  Oh, there's four years in high school?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  Uh, here it --
