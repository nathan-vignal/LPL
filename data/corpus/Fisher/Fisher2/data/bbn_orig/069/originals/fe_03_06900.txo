L:  Hi, my name's Barbara.
R:  Hi, ah my name's Linda.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay, Linda.
R:  Ah, what -- how -- how do you feel about the topic at hand?
L:  Um, it's kind of like, it's -- it's deep --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's really [MN] you know, it's not something that um is really you have to really like --
R:  That's --
L:  -- sit down and thing about it.
R:  That's -- well, ah, you know, I've done a lot of thinking about it but the thing with me is um [LIPSMACK] I -- I really don't have much of a background of following the pr- -- you know the peace process through the past fifteen years, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it just -- it just seems like everything has just gone up in flames, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it ah it -- it basically has, you know, it ah it -- it just seems so much more violent and, you know, than -- than I've seen since the time Carter was in office, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, aside from that I -- I mean, I have been following the news intently, so I've been following what's happening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think the more we -- we stay involved ah the more ah that the more ah -- ah complicated things become.
L:  Oh, really?  Because um back when you was mentioning back when in Carter when he was in office --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was b- -- I was like born in sixty nine, so I was like young.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I really didn't, you know, know to much about like --
R:  I -- I was the same, I was -- I was young also, but w- -- what I -- I was like sevenish or ten, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but what I remember in my mind's eye was that Carter always [MN] you know things weren't quite so bad and ah I think a lot that had to do with that, even though a lot of people didn't like Carter --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- was that he was he in my mind's eye even as a kid, whenever I would look at Carter I would see him sitting with Arafat --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and ah I think that -- I think basically since Carter left the White House we kind of forgot a little bit about diplomacy --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and ah you know keeping in touch with these people and it's not the kind of ah it the -- at that end of the world you really can't just, you know, let things be for such a long period of time.
L:  Right.
R:  After being involved, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, yeah, go ahead.
L:  So, do you think um there will be peace in the Middle East, do you think that we can achieve that?
R:  I ah [LIPSMACK] it's been -- it's been ongoing for so many years and ah you know it has to do with property and it -- just so many different involved things and I think that it's -- it's kind of -- it's going to be very hard for us to catch up ah with all these things that are happening now seeing as they -- they didn't keep up their diplomatic efforts for the, you know, maybe for ten years or so.  They kind of let it go a little bit.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they were doing things, having to do with this country --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, you know, but it -- it -- it -- I feel it's very involved.  It involves oil, it involves, Palestinians, um, the other Middle Eastern countries, they're not willing to take the Palestinians in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they want ah not because they're undesirable, but because they want to keep them where they are to keep the pressure on the Israelis.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ah, it's -- it's um, it's very involved.  I don't know that there is an answer at this point, especially since, you know, we -- we haven't kept up with it.
L:  Yeah.  And then um what gets me is um like when you had the war, it first started --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was a little, you know, I was scared.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, and even now I'm a little scared because um I think, I don't know if it's like the media --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, you know, you're looking over your shoulder and I'm like, you know --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- on the subway, thinking, like who's a terrorist and then, you know --
R:  Well --
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  Well, it -- it, you know, there -- nine eleven happened and that was a -- a miserably terrible thing --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um and it was done a grand scale, but then after that um as far as the Middle Easterners and East Asian folks are concerned, I -- I haven't seen really a true peep out of them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I mean that -- which -- which gladly so.  I haven't seen any real thing happen with them [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah you know just that leads me to believe that it's -- it's ah so much more complex than we can even gather at our level, not being involved on a daily basis.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, here they got this massive, massive terrorist attack together --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know and ah -- and ah you know we weren't aware of what was going to happen and now I think they sit on pins and needles and watch every fax and every internet conversation --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and ah you know and -- and yet there was no warning for nine eleven.  So, there's -- they're really no use sitting on pins and needles and yourself --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or being afraid because there was no warning for nine eleven.
L:  Ah you're right [LAUGH].
R:  So, you just -- I mean, to me, and I -- I -- you know, I -- I do put a lot of thought into things, but again I don't know how um you know how knowledgeable my thoughts are because I haven't followed the situation until all this happened and since then I've been following it closely and asking people who are n- -- more knowledgeable about it, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but I -- I just think you know e- -- you have to be at the at the level of government and part of you know maybe the elite class.  For us, you know, we go to work everyday and what have you, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they're involved in it every day and I think it just goes much more complex um with Europe- -- with Europe and -- and -- and many other factors --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and you don't know how much has been invested in what country and e- -- just a number of different things, you know.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Right.  A- -- and then I had a gap um, like I was like against war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because then it's -- it was like um I guess -- I don't know what's the word for it when you're -- you're -- you're just not sure --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if -- if -- y- -- you know, to take a stand because after a while it's like you get tired, you know --
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  -- you get tired of running and running.
R:  W- -- well, that -- that's -- that's the one thing and then the second thing is, when you know somebody asked me, why did we first go into Afghanistan --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and after all this or you know when so many things happening, I -- I was thinking to myself, why did we go into Afghanistan?
L:  Mm.
R:  And then I -- e- -- that's how far we've come --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- from the original goal which was to get Bin Laden --
L:  Right.
R:  -- right?  And ah the -- and -- and it's like, oh yeah, that's why we went there and then we went into Iraq and now they want to go into Iran --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I feel like this country is -- is devastated so maybe financially -- so maybe they could take a pause right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and do -- you know, put some funds back into this country and then move forward --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, ah, for whatever reason, but Iran has been a qui- -- has been quiet.
L:  Right.
R:  And so, and you know I -- I feel like, let's -- let's put a pause on it and ah you know maybe do some things to help the economy here, concentrate on that.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  
R:  You know, because like we got Saddam out of power, that's great.  That's you know but I e- -- I think every e- -- I think we need to pause on that and -- and start spending some money here before we go down the drain [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- the economy and everything, you know.
L:  That's true [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  Um, where -- where are you hailing from?  What State?
L:  Washington DC.
R:  Oh, Washington DC.  Yeah, I'm in New York, you know.
L:  Oh really?
R:  So, m- -- yeah.  So, you -- you're in the hub of it all, but I'm in --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm in ah Staten Island, you know.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I didn't know this um -- that this um -- this ah -- I guess you call it a study --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I didn't know that it reached all the way to New York.  I thought it was just for ah people living like in Washington and Baltimore, Maryland and Virginia area.
R:  [NOISE] No, no.  I e- -- well, I mean I signed up and ah I've spoken to people ah all over --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- basically.  But I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I think I -- I have -- well, I spoke to a lady in Tennessee, I spoke to a gentleman in Baltimore --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so, it reached down to Tennessee [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, ah, how are things in Washington?
L:  [SIGH] Oh, it's okay.  It's -- it's so far it's okay --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like I love ah -- terror level went from what code orange to code yellow --
R:  Yes, so we're back down --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- to that, yeah.
L:  Yes.  So, we got a lot of um security in place, stuff like that.
R:  How do you feel about the country going into Iran now?
L:  Oh.
R:  Do you think it's necessary?
L:  Um, actually, I -- I have no thought about that right now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I haven't been actually looking at the TV --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, so I haven't really been like far -- for the past I guess couple of weeks since it has kind of like died down --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and ah and some of our ah you know troops are coming home --
R:  Well, they want to go into Iran this -- in the same way they went into Iraq.
L:  What?  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  So, it just seems like a lot, that's what I was saying.  Maybe they should put pause on it and do something for you know to revive the country --
L:  [COUGH] Mhm.
R:  -- then they could go back to what they're doing, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because we made a major accomplishment already, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So ...
L:  And then, um, I really you know they don't know what Saddam is ah dead or is he alive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm just, you know, it's just --
R:  I mean it just -- it -- it -- it -- it seems -- it seems kind of odd that they -- they -- they did say that he had all of these chemical weapons --
L:  Right.  Yeah, man --
R:  -- and yet -- and yet the -- the country w- -- we took it over so easily --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I just wonder, where were the weapons?  You know.
L:  Now, what I'm saying --
R:  I'm sure they're somewhere, but I don't know where.  You know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and that's the whole reason we went there.
L:  To get it disarm just yeah --
R:  Right.  And we not only disarmed him, we got him out of power.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, so that's great, you know, because the people are happy and everything like that, but I don't see an immediate need to go into Iran, they've been quiet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I figure, you know
