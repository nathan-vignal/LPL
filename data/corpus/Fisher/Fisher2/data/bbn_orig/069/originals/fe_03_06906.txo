R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  Uh, hello.
L:  Where -- where are you from?
R:  Uh, uh, Virginia.
L:  Where?
R:  In Virginia.
L:  Virginia?  I'm in Oklahoma.
R:  Yeah.  Um, uh, the -- uh, the topic was about, uh, why the war -- um, what countries is a threat?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, uh, let's see.  I'm trying to think of which country.  Uh, right now, uh, the only threat I think of is, um, uh, I don't know what country that is.  I think it's Korea, if I'm not mistaken.
L:  I think it's Afghanistan.
R:  Afghanistan?  Yeah.  Uh, uh, about the [NOISE] uh, what do you think about the Chinese as far as taking over?
L:  Well, I really don't know a whole lot about that one yet.  I haven't really kept up on it.  Have you?
R:  Yeah, um, some, um, uh, uh, they're supposed to -- not China but, um, uh, the one the Korean states supposed, uh, to have nuclear weapons, also of mass destruction [NOISE] but, um, we have to look into that one.  Into that country more.
L:  Yes. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah, but, uh, Afghanistan -- I think Afghanistan is still-- is, uh, a threat to this country.
L:  Yes, I do too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, anybody who, uh, you know, wants to hurt somebody, just deliberately hurt 'em are a threat.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, there -- there's no sense in -- in people going around being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mean and ugly like that.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know, it's just like this bomber they caught, you know.  Uh, it took 'em five years but they got him.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, sure they -- uh, um, hm.
L:  But I feel that anybody that's gonna do -- do something like that to -- to anybody is a threat to us.
R:  Correct, correct. 
L:  But I think, uh, Afghanistan and -- and, uh, uh [MN] all those places off overseas that we've got people right now are a threat to us.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
L:  Germany may even be.
R:  Yeah, they may be.  Um, so if they was, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- holding Afghan- [LAUGH] since they was giving chemical weapons to Afghanistan -- Afghanistan and the rest of the, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people.
L:  Uh-huh 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But, um, I think the [several inaudible words] threat.  Uh [MN] --
L:  I think there's, uh, a lot more places around that is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- actually a threat to us than what any of us really know.
R:  Why, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Because our -- our government's only gonna let us know what they want us to know.  They're gonna keep us in the dark.
R:  Correct, yep.
L:  Because they're afraid of scaring us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're gonna get blowed off the face of the earth and then they're gonna say, "Oops".
R:  Uh-huh, we did it [LAUGH].
L:  We forgot to tell you all this.
R:  Yeah, that's how they're gonna do it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's how they're gonna do it.
L:  Pardon me?
R:  I was saying that's how they're gonna do it, yep, [several inaudible words]
L:  Yeah, I don't know what they're gonna do with it yet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I-- I'm thinking that maybe they don't even know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, what they're gonna do yet.
R:  Yeah, I didn't, uh hear nothing about, uh, Bush yet.  Uh, I -- I think he went over there, I think it was last week if I'm not mistaken --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to talk to one of the governments or -- no, he went over there for, um -- to Russia.
L:  Yeah, I seen something about that on the news last night.
R:  Yeah, right.  Yeah.
L:  I -- I just don't pay a whole lot of attention to the news.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know, I probably should but I don't.  I figure if we're gonna die, we're gonna die, you know.  I mean, there's nothing we're gonna be able to do about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When it comes our time, it's our time and, you know, that's the end of it.
R:  Right.  Yep.
L:  I don't know, maybe I look at things a little differenter than -- than some people do but I just believe when it's our time, it's our time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  When God wants us, he wants us.
R:  Right [NOISE].
L:  So, how did you get into all this?
R:  Uh, off the net [NOISE].  Off the Internet.
L:  Oh.
R:  I saw it.
L:  A girlfriend of mine sent it to -- to me.  Actually this should be my husband talking to you [LAUGH] instead of me but he wasn't home so ...
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I figured, what the heck?  As long as one of us is doing some talking [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yep.
L:  I don't guess it's gonna hurt nothing.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I think, uh -- my wife signed me -- my wife's signed me up for this [NOISE].
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah [NOISE]
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  yeah [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, my girlfriend sent to my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- husband and I and my husband's the one that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- went ahead and, um, signed up for it.  I haven't yet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just get tired of answering the telephone [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, the telemarketers.
L:  Well, I got a lot of -- uh, a lot of, uh, bill collectors and stuff after me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- right now and I just get real tired of the phone [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like you all just go away, leave me alone [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I know I owe it.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I can't nothing right yet [LAUGH].  I'll take care of it when I can [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  Yeah, I do the same thing [NOISE].  Yep.
L:  So, do you think that, uh, we're -- we're in quite a bit of danger and stuff then?
R:  N- No, not really.  Well, yeah and no.  Uh, both because, um, I don't think, uh -- I don't think they found, uh, Osama bin Laden yet [NOISE].  I mean they found -- found bin Laden, um, uh, they say he's dead but I don't know [NOISE].
L:  Well, they -- they --
R:  Saddam -- Saddam Hussein, that's what I should have said, sorry.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Both of them really [NOISE].
L:  Well, they're saying they're dead but can they prove it?
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  They -- yeah, they're saying they did in a bunker but I don't know.
L:  They -- they haven't proved it yet you know and, uh, no body, no death, you know.
R:  Yeah, I know [NOISE].  True.  They said that he could be riding around, uh, there driving a cab, Saddam Hussein.  That's what they said anyway [NOISE].
L:  Oh, yeah.  He could be doing a lot of things, you know.  Uh, he could be a cab driver.  He -- he could even be here in the States right now and nobody actually know it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we-- we don't have the safest place in the world, that's for sure.
R:  No.
L:  Otherwise all that mess with, uh, uh, nine eleven wouldn't have happened.
R:  Yeah, with the terrorists, yeah.
L:  You know, and see our government supposedly had already been warned about it.
R:  Right.
L:  And they didn't pay a whole lot of attention obviously.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And if you know anything about Oliver North --
R:  Oliver North?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I heard something about him a little bit.
L:  Okay, if you know anything about him, you will also know that, uh, he tried to warn the government back years ago when he was going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- through all his stuff, uh, about, uh, bin Laden.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, yeah, I heard that, uh, the US supposed to have known --
L:  I --
R:  -- already known about the nine eleven, uh, before they were [inaudible] uh --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, he used the planes to smash into the, uh World Trade --
L:  I've -- I've got a deal on -- on -- well, it's in my husband's website.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, we have a, uh -- oh, I guess you could call it like a letter on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where, uh, it -- it goes into a little bit of detail as -- as far as, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, Oliver North and -- and that type of stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I guess I'll have to read up on that [NOISE].  Um --
L:  Who are you on the Internet [MN]?
R:  Who me?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  What do you mean -- uh, what do you mean like email or ...?
L:  Well -- you're -- you're like a Yahoo ID.  Do you have one?
R:  No, I don't have a Yahoo ID.  I'm on MSN.
