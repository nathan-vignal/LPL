R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Regina.
R:  I'm Candice.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm -- I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good, thanks.  Do you have any ideas on today's topic?
L:  Well, honestly, I'm just not sure.  Ah, I think with the situation that we're in right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if we go over there and rebuild and -- and help do all kinds of things, I'm concerned that we're just helping them build more resources to come back and attack us.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's interesting.  See, I'm doing National Development work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I actually work for Save the Children and one of the projects I'm working on is the rebuilding of Iraq, so --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- yeah.  But um I guess like I have a different perspective because I -- I think, maybe because of the reports I read are all about women and children being, you know, raped and things right now, I just don't feel that at this point in time that even after the rebuilding that they would be strong enough to really come after us.  And I think the terrorist cells that are already in existence are strong enough and those aren't the people we're helping to rebuild.  But I have a kind of tainted view on that subject.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Um --
L:  -- I don't know.  I can't see -- I don't know.  There's so many different places that would -- would want to come and do something because they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of other countries, I guess, want them to be in the same -- want us to be in the same situation they're in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, which --
R:  Definitely.
L:  -- in ways I kinda think we are [LAUGH]. You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we're being told what to do, how to do it.  We don't have the same freedoms that we should have had --
R:  Ah- --
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  I think that ah the country that I view as the biggest threat right now is North Korea [LAUGH] simply because you know they have just such an -- an endless army and such a huge capacity for -- for destruction at this point in time and it kind of um -- I think it kind of worries me because you know we can make threats to stop them, but we still don't have the, you know, the same army capacity, the same weapons.  I mean, the -- it would just be -- I think there'd be more for us to lose from North Korea than if -- if by them attacking us than if we attacked them.
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  So, that's a little scary to me.
L:  That's true.  And I also I -- h- -- this may sound strange, but I also think that we're a threat amongst ourselves.
R:  Yeah, I can see that.
L:  I really do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Because there's -- there's too many differences of opinion --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I don't think everybody's working towards the same goal as it w- -- as it should have started out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because we're -- you know, everybody wants to do one thing, things going another way, like --
R:  Everybody thinks they know what's best [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I keep thinking to myself, "If -- if the people who were actually fighting in these wars -- 'cause my dad was a veteran of two different wars" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- "And if the actual guys who were -- who were over there doing the fighting were in charge of the governing of it" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- "things might be different" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  Maybe we could actually be able to do what they say, communicate instead of having to raise arms to do it.
R:  Yeah.  You know what?  The thing is though as well that even when we do have to raise arms to do it, I think that because we haven't had any wars in the US in, you know, since what like the Civil War, I think that it's -- people really don't know what a war is really about and so it's like as much as everybody says they're for it, they never truly commit to what the reality of a war is.  I mean, people know, you know, Vietnam and World War Two and One and everything, but it seems like such a l- -- I think for at least me and a lot of the -- the people that I know it's, you have an idea of what war is, but you really don't comprehend like the true death and destruction that -- that goes along with it, just because we haven't seen it here.  So ...
L:  And see, that's -- that's what bothers me the most.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  About --
R:  That's why I think you're right in that -- in that respect that it would be good to have people who have been in wars as leaders, you know, they know the reality of it.
L:  Yeah, but I think that if they could sit down at the table --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and plan things out there wouldn't be any more wars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They could come to some type of a mutual agreement that would benefit everybody.
R:  Huh.
L:  Because a --
R:  I don't know.  I don't think you're ever going to get rid of war.  I don't think --
L:  No, but --
R:  -- you're ever going to get to that point.
L:  It would sure be nice, because like --
R:  It would.
L:  -- you know, you -- you hate living in -- with the fear of threats --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and with the fear of bombings and -- and, you know, like the thing that happened, you know, in -- in the nine one one thing and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, to me, there was no need for that whatsoever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, and it's --
R:  Yeah, I do think that our biggest threat is come -- comes from the developing world, simply because they have nothing to lose.  When you have nothing to lose, you're willing to risk everything.
L:  Yeah.  This is true.
R:  It's not like, you know, Europe is going to attack us.  They've got so much to lose economically, you know.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  And I think that -- I think from just watching the news and -- and hearing everything it worries me to take resources from here to rebuild another place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I wish that there was a way that everyone could do as they did in the beginning, you know, create their own resources and be more self ah supportive --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- you know, then you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wouldn't have to rely on someone else to do it.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but the way everything's going, I -- that I think that once, you know, globalisation has set in and I don't think there's any turning back.  You know, I think it's just going to be the new reality of it all, but I -- what scares me is that we've left out a huge part of the population of the world and until they're tied into it and feel the need to preserve it, then I think there's always going to be an outside threat.  You know --
L:  Yeah, I think so too.
R:  -- that -- if you don't have anything -- if you're not involved, you can cut yourself off from, you know, twenty different countries and it's not going to affect you unless your agriculture goes down and then you need food [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] That's true too.
R:  So ...  Yeah.
L:  And I know one thing is, it's getting awful over here just in the United States itself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, how, you know, the economy is getting bad and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so I really feel that you know I -- I don't fear so much threats from other countries --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as I do of our own collapse, basically.
R:  Huh.
L:  You know, economically and -- and ah, you know, foodwise, everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because so much is going to so many other places, you know?
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, that's what I think.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.  H- 
L:  And see, I'm ah -- I'm an awful person.  I'm more into animals than I am anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I always feel like, you know, people remember people, but they don't ever remember things that they think are unimportant --
R:  Yeah.  I- --
L:  -- you know, like that.
R:  -- it's like the US go- -- we have like a very small food aid that we give to the res- -- just because I work with it, this is why I know this, but we don't give that much food aid away at all, it's all -- all of our surplus and the farmers are actually the people pushing for it because we have such huge supplies that we could feed our nation -- I think the statistic was like twice -- from what we have stored up, but they force it -- force us, the government, to give it away so that it doesn't rot and it doesn't drop their prices.  And they view as like this'll be a new market once they can afford it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But the rest of the world hates that we give away something like -- no, we don't even give more food than most of Europe, but that we give food aid, because they say we're dumping it and cutting their prices.  So, it's interesting that you think that we give too much.  Like it's --
L:  Well, I think too much time, I think not just food, but too much time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like the president, I watched that speech where he was talking about rebuilding and doing this and doing that and it's great to go and help other people, I'm all for lending a hand --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but there's so much need still over here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then with so many of -- of ah you know like the soldiers and things that's over there now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I just think it's wrong.  I think that they should never have started this war and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I'm all for -- I'm -- I'm the type, I just don't believe that conflict can solve anything, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I think that debating can solve things, because you can come up with a lot of ideas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I really truly think that, you know, our biggest threat is right here.
R:  Huh, that -- that's an interesting perspective.
L:  It's -- it's an awful perspective, I guess --
R:  I don't think it's awful --
L:  -- because -- well, I do, bec- -- I- -- in some ways I do because you know I love to share things and I'm a giving person --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I just think too much goes to other places, especially, you know, people that like the -- the soldiers, the men and women that are there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- there's so much they could do here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in building and carrying on and then teach people in other countries to do the same thing.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, in that -- it -- it's strange the way I think about certain things like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's just to me, like, you know, everybody tells me because I'm in animal rescue --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that ah I should think more about homeless people and starving children.
R:  See, I don't agree with that at all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean, as I -- there are other things to consider of course, but everybody, you know, not everybody can focus on homeless people and starving children --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's more than that issue that goes on.  I think that's like what we have that a lot of c- -- other countries don't, like we don't have to just deal with it, the basic needs of survival --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is kind of like why I think that it helps to give our excess to other countries, because I think it helps curb some of the resentment that's built up towards us because we have so much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's kind of why I think that it's great that because we have so much we can focus on other things that are a problem.  And, I don't know, for me I think animals are a priority, because if you go to developing countries, you've got rabid dogs and cats and little kids playing with them and then they get rabies and there's no way to treat it.  I mean, these kids are half starved anyway, so you get some kind of disease from an animal and it's worse.  You know?  And you have animals that attack small children because they're wild and no one feeds 'em, so it's like if there's nothing to eat and there's a little kid, they'll go after it.  So --
L:  And see, that's the -- that's the very thing I'd rescue, is all the ferals --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that are roaming around.  I rescue 'em, rehabilitate 'em and I've had some for three years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that are the most loveable things and I think, you know, people say, "Well, you know, we can -- we can do this and we can do that in other countries" and it just -- it bugs the daylights out of me because there's so much to do here.
R:  Yeah.  But I don't -- I also don't think that we should be doing that for other countries, like I think we -- we should be teaching them -- you know, we have a lot of technology in the US that like -- and we take it for granted --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that it's gonna be other places.  Like I was in Peace Corps and they had never seen an airplane before until like about two years ago and they called it like the silver, or the flying box, you know, it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which -- and they had no idea w- -- like the map, they didn't understand why I couldn't get on a bus and drive home to see my parents when I miss 'em.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's like, it's hard to -- to -- to feel that these people don't see us as a threat because we have so much, so much that
