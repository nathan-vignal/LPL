L:  Hi, I'm Marguerite.
R:  Hi, I'm Anne. [NOISE]
L:  And, um [NOISE] -- well, I think the reality is computers are part of our lives so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of course they need to be used in education.  As far as giving kids absolute free access to the internet, no, I don't -- I don't think that's right but, [SIGH] um, you know, pretty much every --
R:  Can you hold on one second? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh sure.
R:  Thanks. [NOISE] 
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] [NOISE]
R:  Sorry, it was my kids.  Okay.
L:  That's all right, I totally understand.  Um, anyway, that's what I think.
R:  I agree because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, I don't know, the internet can do a lot of -- [SIGH] I don't know, the internet can get a lot of, um, information for them for school and things like that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, I agree and I guess the -- the thing to do is to just try to [SIGH] -- to monitor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, [NOISE] monitor what they're using on the internet, and I know there's filters and all that kind of thing.  My son is only one so we haven't really -- really looked at -- into that yet.
R:  Right, no, I have a high school who are graduating so --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay, you're a lot more knowledgeable on that, I'm sure than I am.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, um, [SIGH] yeah, I'm sure we'll be -- we'll be using, uh, some sort of filtering --
R:  Oh yeah, I mean, when it comes to projects and things like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if you don't have a computer at home and the internet, it's almost impossible to get anything done 'cause they -- they require that so, so much at the school levels.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, to get -- to have -- I mean, it's almost impossible to get through high school without a computer at home --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- unless you go to the library.
L:  Well, I think the thing is then if you don't have one and most of the other kids do, you're really disadvantaged competitively.
R:  Oh yeah, oh yes, definitely disadvantaged because, I mean, they do let 'em have access to 'em at school but definitely not enough time to access it to get what they need to get done.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um --
L:  And then fr- -- from what I hear about homework these days is kids get so much homework to do that maybe they can't get it all done in the times the school's open --
R:  No, they can't.
L:  -- they have time at home --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and so --
R:  Like there's -- yeah, no, I mean, definitely, definitely needed. [LAUGH]
L:  As far as your -- your child's friends who are in high school.  I -- I -- I mean, do they mostly all have computers?  I just sort of assume everybody --
R:  Yes, they do.
L:  -- does.
R:  I mean, there's some of 'em that don't have certain programs and stuff so that's kinda hard so you have to kinda get a buddy system so that you can, um, you know, do some of your projects 'cause it's not just all through internet or computer, there's also [SIGH] like, you know, things that need to be done in Excel or things that need to be done in PowerPoint and all that good stuff.
L:  Oh, oh okay.
R:  So a lot of people don't have PowerPoint, that's a pretty expensive, um, program to put on your computer so you have to kind of find a buddy who has it so that you can get that part of your project done.
L:  [MN]
R:  'Cause I know my son was in middle school at the time and we didn't have it then and he actually lost a lot of points for not finishing his PowerPoint, and I explained to the teacher we don't have it and he said, well he had enough time in class, but my son [SIGH] who's straight As so I tend to believe him --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- did not have enough time to do it in school.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, ya.
L:  Okay. [NOISE] PowerPoint does, um -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's with Microsoft isn't it, that's Microsoft Office Suite, isn't it, with like Excel and --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, most of them come with Excel but a lot -- um, PowerPoint they don't.
L:  Oh.
R:  A lot of projects in the high sch- -- actually, starting in the late middle school and high school, there's a lot of PowerPoint, um, usage also --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- to get their projects done and they have to present them at school and stuff like that so --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I didn't realize they used that stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I figured, you know, some kind of word processing programs but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Okay, so they're doing actual presentations then, I suppose?
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- very, very intense ones.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, like I said, I actually -- my son was doing +PowerPoint -- PowerPoint during middle school also so it --
L:  And is your son in regular -- like a regular high school, is it some sort of a magnet school or --
R:  No, he's in high school.  Um, he started with honors classes and then I've got my -- he's actually graduating in a couple weeks, and then I've got a freshman also.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, between the two of 'em -- I mean, they actually need their own computers, uh, because it's like between the two of 'em it's really hard to get them --
L:  Not enough time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, but the other one's going off to college so, I mean --
L:  You managed to make it by with one computer.
R:  Yeah, we managed it for one year.  It --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was fine but if it was like -- like a sophomore and a, um, senior --
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  -- you'd definitely, definitely have to have [LAUGH] two computers almost in your home, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, so ... but you'll have a lot to look forward to. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- yeah, I guess so.  I'll have to -- and I -- I use computers but I -- I mean, like, I don't know how to use PowerPoint.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know basic Excel and --
R:  And I -- I don't know if they -- I don't know how, actually, 'cause I don't either, um, I don't know if they taught them in school level or if they just kinda --
L:  That's what I was going to ask you, where do they learn how to use that?
R:  I don't know if it's just trial and error or if they learned it, I really don't know, to be honest with you, I don't know what --
L:  But somehow your kids figured out and they know how to use it now.
R:  Yeah, kinda like, you know -- yeah, trial and error, I'd say, you know.  I -- unless the teacher -- because there's different kind of PowerPoint presentations you can do so [SIGH] -- but, yeah, they're very, very important so ... and the internet, like I said, I mean, he'll have to send things home from the internet and vice versa, some things back to school or [SIGH] -- you know, he has to write down on his actual sources that he got from there so [NOISE] -- but --
L:  Hm.  Well, some people have sent us, um, like for gifts for my son, computer programs.  I guess they're games [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- for kids as young as one.
R:  Right.
L:  But my son -- well, he's actually almost two, [LAUGH] he's just not ready for that.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He's more -- he's like a real boy boy and he's just more interested in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- trying to figure out how to pull out all the cables and --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, he's not going to just sit --
R:  [NOISE] I mean, they --
L:  Maybe there's -- maybe there's one year olds that do but he's just not going to sit at the keyboard and just be --
R:  [NOISE]  Right.  I think a lot of those, for the younger ones, are more like matching or maybe sounds or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- colors or -- where, like, instead of doing it on a board you can do it on the computer.
L:  On the computer.
R:  I can't imagine them doing it by themselves at that age.  I mean, [SIGH] no way. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  No way.
L:  Oh no, I'm sure --
R:  They're like --
L:  -- that they would need adult supervision but even so it's like my son'll look at the screen for, you know, maybe five seconds --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then he's trying to figure out --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like I said, how to take things apart and it's just --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  It's just not worth it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  I'm just going to wait until he gets a little bit older and --
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I don't -- I never experienced that 'cause we didn't have computers when my kids [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, I'm sure they were out there but not like as popular as they are now and everything so [NOISE] -- [SIGH] but, um, yeah, I don't know, I just -- you -- I mean, as he gets older, your -- I mean, I'm sure in -- by the time he gets in high school things will be so different as far as computer goes and everything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so ... [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, who knows what it'll be like then.
R:  Can you hold on one second? [LAUGH]
L:  Sure. [LAUGH]
R:  Thanks. [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] It's all right. [NOISE] [PAUSE] 
R:  Okay, sorry.  So, um [NOISE] it's just crazy.  But, yeah, like I said, it's just really important and they -- they do play games on the computer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, probably not the most healthiest ones but, you know, it gives them time to relax their mind instead of schoolwork --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff like that so [SIGH] I mean, [NOISE] I'm lucky, knock on wood type thing, that my kids are doing okay. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean --
L:  Well. if they're doing that well in school --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- it's really a good sign.
R:  And you do, I mean, when you've got two teenagers at home and they're doing that good, you just really -- I mean, it's knocking on wood 'cause you've got that fifty fifty percent chance. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Are they boys or girls?
R:  Oh, two boys.
L:  Oh, two boys, wow.
R:  Yeah.  Um, so, just watching the little one turn into the big one as the big one's getting out of that stage it's kind of different but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they kinda see themselves going through those same phases or whatever. [NOISE] But, yeah, they fight over -- they fight to get to the computer and, you know, but homework comes first and then the games come after they're all done.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  And so with the games, do they use --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is that a mouse with that or is it, um, like one of those game control --
R:  No, they use a mouse and everything.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, they use a, um, mouse and I think -- I think they do use the keyboard a little bit, like, I don't know.  I'm not even sure, I don't even watch 'em play the games.
L:  Well, I mean, is it the same thing as -- as like the Nintendo type things?
R:  Well, no, because they have to use the keyboard, like, to do stuff.
L:  Oh.
R:  Like, I don't know if they press enter or, you know -- or if they use their mouse and click it or -- but definitely it's just a mouse and a keyboard to play the games.
L:  Hm.
R:  And they don't really play that much on the computer.  Like, I know a lot of people, like, go outside and play against other people, like someone in, you know, Kentucky could have -- be playing backgammon and then you can play with that person through the internet.
L:  Oh yeah, I've heard of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they don't go as far as like that detailed, as far as like, you know, playing somebody else outside, you know [SIGH] -- 'cause they have like a lot of gaming places now --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- where people go and do that and they're -- they're not into like that so much as like individual play just with themselves and --
L:  Just their own -- yeah, okay.
R:  Yeah, their own +selves and everything, so ... [SIGH] but, yeah --
L:  Yeah, well, I guess I do have all that to look forward to. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you do. [LAUGH] A lot to look for --
