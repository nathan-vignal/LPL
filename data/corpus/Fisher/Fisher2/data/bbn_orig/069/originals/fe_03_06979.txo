R:  Hi, this is J.J.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, this is J.J. --
L:  Hi, hi.  [LAUGH] 
R:  How're you doing?
L:  I'm doing well.  How are you doing today -- 
R:  Good.  Doing great.  Doing great.  So, the --  
L:  The -- the only problem is I seem to have missed the exact -- um, the exact sentence they said that our topic was about.  I heard education.  I didn't hear anything else.
R:  Um, computers and education.  Do you think the edu- education is hurt or harmed by computers?
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah -- 
L:  Well, I'll start by saying my stance, I think it's definitely helped by computers.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, all right.
R:  Absolutely -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  -- yeah, I think, um, um, [inaudible] -- 
L:  One thing that I can say about -- about computers and education is that it provides -- computers makes information -- it's at your finger tips.
R:  Right.
L:  Whether it's incom- -- you know, buying a -- a CD rom that has an encyclopedia or looking on line for people who are experts in the field that you're trying to study, looking for articles that have been written, looking up facts like it's -- it's basically not only the answer to that information but also a way to store the information and create, you know, lists, flow charts, you know, organisation systems, or trade information like, ah, I -- it -- I can't even think of any way that's negative for education at all. 
R:  No, ah, I really can't either.  Um, [MN] ah, I think --  
L:  Maybe cheating.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Cheating.  But, you know what?  Everybody is hip to that.  You know, I mean I think that -- because I've read new stories[?] or whatever about, um, these kids that, you know, get term papers off the internet and stuff -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the professors and so on are so hip to that that, you know, they can recognize 'em right off the bat and they can trace 'em down to the exact source and you know, so I think it's, um, any plagiarism that people are able to do maybe a few years' ago, I think that it's pretty much a -- you know, they've been caught and -- and everybody's on to 'em.  So, [MN] um, yeah, I think it's great because, um, you know, it offers a different sort of venue for, um, [MN] you know, learning because everybody learns differently.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you know, even with small kids, that they can do -- like, there's a lot of self paced, um, computer aided education and you know, that -- that left the slower kids have a repeat or the quicker kids go faster or you know, you can do visual, you can do tactile, you can do audio.  You know, it's just, um, things like it really, ah, [MN] you know -- 
L:  Offers -- 
R:  -- ad- addresses --  
L:  -- offers any learning style.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, how -- is what I would -- I would, ah, you know, complete that sentence for sure.  I mean, you're right about learning differently, like, I know when my mother and my grandmother went to school it was very much like more the school of thought is this is the way we teach and this is the way you learn.  You sit here and you listen and you take notes and you shut up and more and more and more like schools I know are changing especially in America but -- but computers offer, just like you said, everybody has a different way of learning [MN] and with the computer you can learn tactile, you know, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ent- entirely and that is -- it's exactly the different ways that you've said, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I think so -- 
L:  It -- I think it provides one more tool for the teacher to say, "Okay, you know, you learn this way, you -- you can work this way".  You know, you have a way of -- of streamlining things and making it so people have, well, much more options and so if they don't learn the way that [inaudible] things have been taught it doesn't automatically make them feel like they're stupid.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, you can --
R:  Right.
L:  -- still learn.  You can still find information and you know, learn just differently.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  What else about computers?  I know that when I got into a higher level school, ah, like in high school, computers had already become much more mainstream and in college, oh, it's -- it's in- -- it's insane, you -- you can't even live without a computer these days.  It becomes, okay, well, go to the library and use their computer.  Great, it's still a computer whether you own one or not your life, you know, especially academically is very dependent on a computer --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- both for the simplest things like organisation, making it so you can write a paper that your teacher can read -- 
R:  Right, right --  
L:  -- you know, a- -- 
R:  -- exactly, exactly.  You're so much better than -- I'm evidently older than you are because -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, in high school -- well, you know, it's really funny because I heard a, ah, MPR. story the other day that -- that a personal computer came out in seventy three.  It's -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thirty years' old.  Well, maybe somewhere but nowhere that I know of because I was at high school and sort of college in the seventies and there was no mention, period, ever of computer in high school and in college the computer was something that took up the entire basement of the science building.  There were just a few little crude monitors around and anything that you did was ah, ah, you know, on DOS and -- and all that kind of stuff, you know?  Um, you know, there was not -- there was no such thing in my world as what we call a personal computer today.  So, it's just amazing that, um, you know, like you said, um, you know, students really have an opportunity to, ah, learn so much more because, you know, all that library research is like from hours down to minutes, you know?  Or it should be if they know [LAUGH] how to use the internet so, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, it -- it makes a huge difference and like you say, doing papers and stuff, it's not retyping, retyping, retyping.  It's just, you know, make a couple of changes in Word and boom, you're there.  So -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  It -- it -- 
L:  And I -- I know when -- 
R:  -- I have no idea how we got it by.  You know, how we got by.  How we made it through school, through business, through life, you know, without computers, you know?  I just love 'em.  [MN] So -- 
L:  Yeah.  There's one thing that I find interesting is the word education.  Like, you automatically think, "School" but I think education continues throughout your life whether it's --
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  -- job or you know, anything.  And one thing I can say for sure is the computers -- like, there were -- there were people obviously that were doing [inaudible] and physics and mathematics before the computer was invented.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But the changes the [several inaudible words] in our knowledge, um, as computers have been brought into the whole science [several inaudible words] field are just -- oh, it's not even the same study anymore.
R:  Right.
L:  Like, are you still there?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] What you can do -- I'm sorry, I heard a click on my phone.  What you can do with a -- with a computer, it frees up so much more time.  Like, when you're talking specifically about higher physics and higher maths, like, for astronomy, figuring out the way the universe works, figuring out the way, you know, flights, ah, can [several inaudible words] and -- and such, all of that stuff.  Like, yes you can do it by hand but -- but how are -- are -- are worldly intelligence, how the people who know how much they know now compared to what they knew ten years' ago -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sixteen years' ago, thirty years' ago, like you say [several inaudible words] say that it's [inaudible] years old, well great, then thirty years' ago, like, w- how far we've come in understanding our environment --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- simply because of computers and that's [several inaudible words], you know, whether -- whether everybody understands that they're just an elite, you know, upper crust group it -- it's true that -- that the kind of growth and expansion we've had in those fields would never have been possible without machines to do the long hard work for us, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  We still need the -- the logic, like the rationale, the way to say, "How do we take this, and this and put it together?"  That requires a human brain.  That will -- you know, I don't know if I believe that will ever be replaced.
R:  Right.
L:  But, the idea that a computer can aid you in very exact -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, complicated, you know, computations -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the way that we can understand our world has grown and as -- as a fact that I can say, "Wait, how do I get here?"  How do I -- you know, I want to know my neighbourhood and my universe, I -- I go in a math class.  [several inaudible words] do -- where are we going to meet [several inaudible words] this restaurant.  Instead of where is it, you know, look in the phone book, call, ask for directions.  I put in my address.  I put in the address that I'm looking for and it tells me how to get there.
R:  I love that. 
L:  It'll even find ways --
R:  Yeah, so -- 
L:  -- to get there avoiding the freeway or avoiding --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mess.  I mean, that's -- that's amazing.  You know that makes my life a lot easier.  Um, whether that's education or not I don't know and I'm educated in knowing where to go.  I have -- I have new allies in -- in finding information, you know?  I would consider that education for sure.
R:  [MN] Okay.  Okay.  I definitely would too.  I definitely -- I definitely would, um, and so -- 
L:  You said what?
R:  Oh, I certainly agree with you.  I really do and -- 
L:  Yeah, and -- 
R:  -- you know, I -- I can't really think of any negative unless perhaps, um, you know, lack of availability, you know, people that just simply -- people -- school districts, you know, maybe they can't afford a computer equipment or can't afford internet access and -- and there's definitely a lot of effort, um, to, you know, alleviate those type of situations but, um, you know, certainly there would be some people that are caught out, you know, the old digital divide there.  So, ah, some -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people that might be a little bit left behind.  Um, but of course it's always been the case but, you know, ah, you know, some groups will always have more -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- resources than others.  Um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- definitely.
L:  Well -- and then you think about -- about, um --
