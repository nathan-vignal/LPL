R:  Hi, my name is Ellen.
L:  I'm Rita.
R:  Hi, Rita.  I'm calling from Vermont.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, what do you think about the topic?
L:  Well, [LAUGH] there was a lot of noise in the background, there was -- I believe the question was what do I think about computers and whether it improves education through children.  Is that correct?
R:  That -- that's what I heard, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, I think it, um, basically is an improvement.  How do you feel?
R:  Well, I -- I think it's great that they get the computer knowledge, um, since they need to use it so much more now than when I was a kid --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I wonder if maybe by introducing it at such a young age there may be missing time that could be spent on something else.
L:  That's true.  I believe there has to be a balance.
R:  I mean, my son is in kindergarten and they have computers every week on --
L:  Do they?
R:  Yeah, it seems sort of silly to me that a, you know, kindergartener who can't necessarily even identify every single letter, you know, is -- is using the -- the computer to, say, make pictures or whatever, um --
L:  That's true and, um, they may give a little more assistance than what is really necessary, uh, and not -- doesn't allow them to, uh, I don't want to say use their imagination but to challenge them. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Well, I know a lot of times, um, like as the kids get older -- uh, my daughter -- my daughter is ten and some of the homework problems that she's got to do have them using computers, you know, and it will say, you know, use the internet to look up, uh, and I don't know if I necessarily think that every child should know how to use the internet at ten, you know.
L:  No, I don't think so either.
R:  You know, especially what if the parents don't have computers --
L:  That was my next --
R:  -- at home.
L:  That was my comment.
R:  You know, then they would have to, you know, find one in the library or -- or stay after school or something like that, um, to finish their homework.
L:  They are taking for granted.  It also gives children, uh, more of a chance --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to use computer in non constructive ways like games and videos and that type of thing and --
R:  That's very true.
L:  [LAUGH] And some of them get so absorbed in them that they forget there's an outside world. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Well, we get -- at the beginning of each school year, we get a, uh, note that comes from the computer lab that warns that, you know, the internet is a dangerous place and make sure that you, you know, sit there and monitor with your child so that, you know, they don't come across any sites that they perhaps shouldn't be coming across --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm just wondering if them going on --
L:  And we know that not all parents do that, correct?
R:  Right, right, and how many of them are out there doing -- looking at sites that maybe don't really help them with [NOISE] what it is they're supposed to be accomplishing? [NOISE]
L:  That's true but in the same respect those same parents probably don't monitor, uh, the TV viewing aspect.
R:  That's true, that's true.  And, I mean, I'm wondering, too, is can the normal ten year old now go into the library and actually use the card catalogue to look something up?
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean they're so used to going into the computer room and sitting down and typing, you know, rabbits or whatever it is that their project is on but could they actually go to the card catalogue and --
L:  Well, I'm not sure --
R:  And --
L:  -- in this age whether it's like using DOS and Windows.  See, I remember the DOS world --
R:  Oh yeah, I do, too.
L:  -- and, uh, the comment from our MIS people was, "No one's going to know how to do these things".  Well, do we really need to know?
R:  True. [NOISE]
L:  And I'm not sure --
R:  I still think they need to know the basics.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, it -- it's great to be able to sit down in front of the computer and, you know, type in a word and have the computer do the work for you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it's like calculators.  If all you know how to do is punch the buttons, then do we stop teaching the kids math --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because the computer will do it for them?
L:  Yeah, that's a real drawback.
R:  You know, we have the spell check on the, you know, term papers or whatever.  Well, the kids can't spell any better than they did before, you know, but the spell check will find all the spelling errors for them.
L:  Well, you know, you do have a point.  Uh, my children didn't have the advantage of having computers as much as children do now.  There were some computers but they were very limited and they may have been better off because they wouldn't have depended on them as much --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as what they are now.
R:  Well I know my parents had a computer when I was growing up but it wasn't ever anything that I sat down in front of to play with or do my homework on or ... you know, it -- it just wasn't -- it wasn't a toy I guess is what I'm saying.
L:  Well, it wasn't a toy nor was it as vis- -- uh, the visuals weren't something that were drawing you there, were they?
R:  True, true.  I mean, nowadays any program you open up, you know, it has, you know, cartoon characters and --
L:  Graphics and sound. [LAUGH]
R:  -- it has music and it has, you know, all sorts of fun exciting things on there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whereas when -- you know, when I first went int computers it had words [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and that was it.  Maybe some of them were orange and some of them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were white but they were pretty much just words.
L:  So I guess the conclusion is it's not really good all the time, is it?  It should be maybe kept to a limited --
R:  Well, I think if they have the basics.  I mean, if -- if they have the knowledge already --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they use the computer to, sort of, expand on the basics --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then that's probably okay but if somebody's sitting down with the computer and doesn't have the basics already, um, you know, I think it's hurting them more than anything.
L:  There'll be problems further down the road.
R:  Sure.  I mean, if -- if you take a -- a nine year old who can't spell because, you know, they run all their homework through --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the spell check, then, you know, at twenty five will they be able to spell any better?
L:  Right, and I guess you more or less answer, you know, you do need spelling and you +do -- do need to know the basics of math without ... so, you know [LAUGH] well, that relates back to DOS and other things but [SIGH] they are getting a bit carried away with them.
R:  Well, I think be -- I mean, I can understand them wanting to know how to use the technology in education.  I mean, there's a lot of information out there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it's a lot easier for, say, a tiny school to make the information on the World Wide Web available to a child doing a term paper --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than it is to try to have a million books in a tiny school library for them to be able to look up for that same term paper --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think that if you -- if you skip over the knowledge and focus too much on the technology portion of it ... I mean, my daughter can sit down with the computer and do just about anything in the world to figure out a math problem but you give her a piece of paper and a pencil and she couldn't do it anywhere nearly as good.
L:  Really?  And it really doesn't -- it would prevent children, I think, from making use of the wonderful libraries that we have.
R:  True.
L:  And nothing's nicer than going into a library and getting lost in a world of books.
R:  Very true.  And I wonder if -- I mean, I'm very lucky, both my kids love to read --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I wonder how many kids that don't enjoy reading, don't enjoy it because they're spending time in front of, you know, all of these programs that are supposed to take the place of reading.
L:  And some of them aren't constructive.
R:  Right, I mean, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess if they -- if they're closely monitored in school so that they're, you know, getting the basics and getting the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- educational process first, then slowly, I guess, using computers to teach them how to actually type and what this key does --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what that key does, then that's probably okay but I'm not sure if, you know, having my five year old sit in front of a computer to paint a picture on the computer screen --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is as useful as sending him to art class and actually letting him dip his fingers in the -- the paints and -- and do it himself.
L:  You do have some points.  Yeah, I tend to agree with you and, um, like you say, maybe if they would just use it on a limited basis because in their adult years they do have to know how to do these things but they don't necessarily have to use it exclusively for all of their homework when they're younger.
R:  That's true, that's true, especially the -- the kids that don't have the computers at home.
L:  Right, and they're developing bad habits as far as using a keyboard because there aren't any five year olds or even six, seven, eight that know how to, uh, type --
R:  That's true, they're --
L:  -- unless they +teaching -- teaching it at a younger age but ...
R:  Well, both of mine just sort of poke at them --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- so I don't think they're actually stressing the typing skills.  Maybe when they get older they teach them more of the -- you know, the appropriate finger placements and stuff but I think they're just teach -- I mean, my son learned how to spell his name on the computer at school. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  You know, I mean, they were teaching him, you know, punch out -- punch out the letters and --
L:  Now, that is scary.
R:  -- you know, he could do that before he could actually print it with the pencil.
L:  That is scary. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that -- that's frightening.  I mean, let's teach him -- let's teach him how to do the basic stuff first, let's teach him penmanship so you can read his writing before you're worrying about, you know, showing him where the letters are on the keyboard.
L:  Is this easier for our teachers?
R:  Well, it's probably -- it's probably easier to read their writing [LAUGH] when they type --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it on the computer.  You know, trying to interpret say a seven or eight year old's penmanship --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, if you don't actually teach penmanship any longer, it's probably easier to have them type it on the computer.  
L:  Your six year old is in kindergarten or first grade?
R:  He's in kindergarten.  He'll graduate kindergarten in two weeks.
L:  And they have computers?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Once a week they go to computer class, yeah.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, yeah, and I mean we live in a -- a small town so it's not like we're in some --
L:  That was my next question.
R:  No, it's got about forty two hundred people in it so it's --
L:  Really?
R:  -- definitely not a big [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- huge city or something.
