L:  Hi, this is Tracey.  I'm from Maine.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Rog- Rogers from New York.
L:  Great.
R:  Hanging in there.  And yourself -- and you're doing okay?
L:  Excuse me?
R:  I said, I'm hanging in there, and you're doing okay?
L:  Oh, yes, yes.  Well, at least we had some good weather today.
R:  Aha.  In Maine?
L:  Yes, in Maine. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Well, we're talking about education and computers right now.
L:  Yes, we are.
R:  And the positive or negative effect --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- thereof, so --
L:  All right.
R:  Ah, you're --
L:  Do you have computers in your school?
R:  Ah, I don't go to school.
L:  Right.  But in your school districts, around there, do you?
R:  I would -- I believe but I'm not privy to that information.
L:  Okay.
R:  And yours?
L:  Well, our school's just started, as part of the new government funding thing last year, where they gave laptop computers to every seventh grader.
R:  The state government?
L:  Yes.
R:  Of -- of Maine?
L:  Of Maine.  And I wasn't sure if it was a federal guideline or not.
R:  But it was a state government?
L:  I believe so.  Just for the state of Maine.  I don't know if any other states have started or not.
R:  Yeah.  Well, um, the governor of New York doesn't wanna do anything but, anyway, that's besides the point.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, you know, just the positive and negative effect of, ah, computers in education, what's your, ah, take on it?
L:  Well, I think there's a lot of positives as far as it gives the kids more opportunities for research and things because they have now more access to the Internet.  And the way our schools work it here is they get their homework assignments, you know, emailed to them, which also gives the parents the option of seeing it, versus just losing it with a piece of paper on the way home.
R:  Ah.
L:  Um, the other pro is that they learn to type, which I think is a huge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- benefit these days.
R:  Right.
L:  And a lot of families don't have computers so it gives them more of a -- an opportunity than they wouldn't have.  As far as the cons go, I dunno, I think to some point it could make them more lackadaisical because they don't go  --
R:  No[?].
R:  -- to the library and research things any more with books and they don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- read as many books as they probably could have.  Because they're playing online.  Um, but I think overall, the pros outweigh the cons.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [PAUSE] What would your -- what would your --
R:  Well, I -- I tend to agree with where you're coming from.  Um, you know, ah, computer in education --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, the thing of it is, is that, um, obviously, it's an easier access, ah, computer, okay?
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you know, admittedly the lackadaisical part is -- is not a positive thing.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, you could probably access more things on a computer than you could otherwise, I would imagine.
L:  Right.  Because I imagine a lot of families don't have access to things like encyclopedias and as many books as -- and then the transportation issue as far as getting young kids to the libraries and things when you have working parents now, so.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I guess it's -- there's a lot of positive things about it, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, perhaps the pros do outweigh the cons, ah, in that regard, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  For -- for, ah, computers in education.
L:  I guess the only -- the only real con I've seen around here is that you get these -- these computers which are laptops, that our schools have been giving out, is that you get the laptops in the hands of these children who then go home and if they -- the parents aren't computer literate or haven't had experience with them, um, they kinda get stuck because if they need help or assistance, the families aren't getting it, but yet the families don't have the support that the kids get at school either.  So, it's, kinda, you're sending home this great technical device that may get used but may not get used by some kids as well.
R:  Yeah.  Well, the other thing that's worrisome, though, for me is, um, automation.
L:  Right.
R:  With computers.  In other words, ah, you know, working people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and education kinda ties into that.
L:  Right.
R:  Because of the fact that, you know, where this whole age is going to, you know?
L:  Right, and --
R:  The future of employment, education, that type of thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and where society is headed.  You know what I mean?
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's rather worrisome because, for example, ah, at this last job they talked about the fact that, ah, computer, ah, robotics could not do the job individuals could and, um, so they had to discontinue the, ah, robotics but, ah, you know, it's a -- it's -- it's -- it's part of education because, um, you know, it's good to be educated but -- but, ah, you know, people need to do things.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.
R:  You don't wanna eradicate individuals in the workplace or education wise, because that would be a bad thing.
L:  Right.
R:  Wouldn't you agree?
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I'm -- I'm pretty much for, you know, education and computers but it's -- I just -- like, we talked about a couple of negatives --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, so, you know, I would imagine that this may even become more advanced in the future.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  That -- you know what I mean?  As -- as prog- -- as supposed progress takes place.
L:  Right.  The thing -- the thing that worries me is that you have -- you have certain students in certain areas that are getting other things.  I mean, they're getting these top of the line educational pieces and you have some other, you know, ar- -- rural areas or smaller towns that wouldn't have access to these things.  And then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [inaudible] happening is, you know, you've got this graduating class going off to college and looking for employment and things and it just -- it concerns me that some people are going to have far more advantage over others by having the knowledge at such a young age.
R:  That comput- -- by computers?
L:  By computers.
R:  Ah.  Well, I'll tell you something, um, [PAUSE] you know, if you can employ the people, okay, then I'm all for the computer use.
L:  Right.
R:  But if you're gonna, you know, eradicate people, then it's, you know, it's worrisome.
L:  Right.  No, that's not what I meant.  I meant, like, there's so many more employment opportunities coming out now.  It seems like the different businesses and areas and -- and things that are up and coming, that it's really -- a lot of positions now, you need to have some computer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- knowledge.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um, which -- which bothers me because some kids can pick up that knowledge faster than others.  And, when we talk about equal opportunity education through these kids, you know, get every kid what they deserve --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that some might fall through the cracks and all because of, you know, something like a computer would hold them back from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- from learning like everyone else. 
R:  Well, it, you know, listen now, let's look at Japan, for example, okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  The most technologically advanced country on the planet, computer use, you know, so widely --
L:  Right.
R:  -- used and, um, they've had their problems, economically, even though they've sold, you know, the best cars or whatever, electronics, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  Um, because of the fact that, um, ah, you know, they still, you know, the -- the richer people still, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  But what I'm trying -- using Japan as an example, is that it was positive for them.  In other words, all these games --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, like Nintendo and Ninja Turtles and all that, those were done by high -- Japanese high school students.
L:  Right.
R:  And so you can see the intelligence that can come out of computer use, when[?] education.
L:  Right.  Exactly.  
R:  Japan is an example. [PAUSE] And, ah, again, I -- I know I said it before, but, you know, you have to watch, ah, the employment situation, with computer use.
L:  Right.
R:  And you made note of the fact that opportunity for kids who aren't exactly, you know, that adept at computers, their, ah, situation, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And I tend to agree with you because some of the stuff can get pretty complex.
L:  Exactly.  And especially when you're, you know, you're starting these kids out so young, at some point it's just like a basic math, as you, you know, grow and you get older, in your -- in your school age and stuff, things get more complicated and --
R:  Definitely.
L:  And when you're starting these kids so young at computers, I mean, I'm -- they're tons of things -- I've been using computers for years but there are still many things that I don't know how to do.  And there's a lot of things[?] that was never learn.
R:  Well, look at your automotive industry.  It became very complex through emissions.  Okay, emissions?
L:  Right.
R:  Because of computers.  Okay?  Those are all computerized.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, when we talk about education, we talk about mechanics that have to go to college.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Because of that situation.  And it's -- it is complex, believe me.
L:  Right.
R:  There's no question about it.  And it could separate a good mechanic -- in other words, there's another example of the negative, where a mechanic could be very w- -- good inclined, although when it comes to computers, they lag.
L:  Right.
R:  And therefore, you -- he could miss an opportunity.  
L:  Exactly.
R:  Because it does -- it is a complex matter.  When you're talking about emissions.  Every year these things change.  The state requires a different amount of emissions.
L:  Right.
R:  And you have to go to class again, okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  For your computer knowledge, if you're a mechanic.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, it's no simple task.
L:  Right.
R:  But, ah, I -- we both a- -- basically said we were for computer use with education, and we noted that there are some cons to it.  I suppose we could say the pros outweigh the cons, both of us.
L:  Right.
R:  But just to watch, you know, those cons.  You know, like lackadaisical behaviour, um, you know, like, ah --
