L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, I ah I'm [LAUGH] I -- I don't know whether we're supposed to use first names or not, but ah --
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't know either.  Anyway, I go by the initials of PS and you are?
R:  I'm Jane.
L:  Jane.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah.  And, Jane, what is -- what is your background as far as this topic goes?
R:  Well, I [SIGH] well, I'm a university student, so I am in education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um and I'm actually the um studying linguistics --
L:  Oh ho.
R:  -- so I'm -- I'm somewhat interested in computer aided education ah I haven't had much experience because while I was in school I didn't really use computers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um but I -- I think -- personally, I think that they -- they help education um because mm they provide a more interactive um [LIPSMACK] opportunity for children to study at home maybe, um their research can be easier than in the library, at least finding the books and ah just the wide variety of topics and um reliable sources that are available on the Internet I think they -- they help with education, but what do you think?
L:  Well, I -- I would -- I would think that I would agree with you.  Just as a little background I spent about thirty years in education.  I was a -- a high school teacher --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a high school principal and a superintendent of schools.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And ah I have a -- a great deal of confidence in computers, ah accessibility to the computers and the amount of knowledge --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah that is out there and can be used in -- in a multitude of settings, whether in a group ah setting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah i.e. distance learning or whether individually.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- I think that there's -- there's real merit to it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um I -- I certainly think that we need to have what -- well, I'm going to rephrase that.  Ah, I certainly think that we need interaction --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- between an individual, you know, a live [LAUGH] in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- individual in person --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in classroom.
R:  Right.
L:  But there's a lot that can be done prior to that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah situation of being in the classroom.
R:  Mhm.  I agree with you.  Yeah.  I think because I -- I've taken a few classes online, but I never really dared to take one where I knew I needed clarification from a -- a live instructor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even though an independent class courses they still give you, you know, an opportunity to email the teacher and contact them and things, I just don't feel like it's as personal and maybe I have other questions and then since it's ti- -- more time consuming I might not ask them and -- but when it's a live person I -- I just feel more confident, so yeah, I -- I don't see independent study overtaking live ah, you know the --
L:  No, the --
R:  -- instruction by any means and I -- I totally agree with you on that.  But -- but there's some courses where um I think it's been fine because either I was familiar with the material enough that I didn't need any clarification or because the instruction was pretty much just the book and that's all the instructor would have done then.
L:  True.  True.  Well I -- I certainly would -- would concur with that.  I -- I also think that we're just in the infancy stage --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of what can be done with computers and I continually ah -- I'm impressed with the amount of knowledge, information --
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  -- that is out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think it would be a -- a real shame not to be able to take advantage of that.
R:  Yeah, I think so, too.  And then that --
L:  I do --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  No.  You go ahead.
R:  Um, it was a different topic, so go ahead.
L:  Well, I think.  I -- I think what I have seen -- again based on my experience -- is that in a lot of cases er- -- young people, ah students are not prepared to take that initiative --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and do it on their own --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know.  They need that structure --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that they should come to the classroom arbitrarily ten until eleven and this is what's going to happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah because they in turn ah have been rather restricted when they've been home not moving to the college level --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they just can't rise to the occasion, they'll put it off --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- that's right.  I think that's too bad.
R:  You know --
L:  [MN]  Excuse me.
R:  -- I -- I agree with you a hundred percent.  And I'm actually taking an online course right now and that's how it is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you're not in a schedule, especially -- I already have a problem with procrastination anyways --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I do.  I do, if it's not --
L:  A lot of us do.
R:  -- something that I have to go to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then you know, "Oh, I can just do it tomorrow or the next day" and I already sense this -- the end of term creeping up on me and so I have to do more now um but, yeah, I -- I -- I agree with that.  I think the -- the structured class schedule is -- is necess- -- the necessity for most students.  I think they have to be really motivated to --
L:  Ah, you know, you know, too, maybe -- maybe one could modify on that ah a little bit ma- -- maybe on the college level maybe freshmen and sophomore years and then gradually ease into more in the junior senior years.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  You know and not -- not a hundred percent, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as everybody matures --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah you begin to see it and say, say I'm investing [LAUGH] --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- in here and I want to get the most out of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah but I -- I think that personal contact is still one of the big things that -- that I think is missing in an awful lot of cases.
R:  I agree.  Um, another aspect that I thought of was um just actually learning how to use a computer helps with a lot of other skills, you know, just even cognitive skills or problem solving skills um, you know, just figuring out if there's a problem with a program, what you do and things like that.  So, I think not even just what the computer provides, but -- but specially for younger children to even learn how to use a computer.  I mean, today it's not as big of a deal, but it -- I think to most kids because they grew up with it, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it still it is a complicated thing to learn so I -- I think that maybe helps them that way too.  [NOISE]
L:  Well I -- you make a -- you make an excellent point.  Though I'm -- I'm old enough that I've got grandchildren --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- and ah my, what they know about a computer they know in some cases they whole a lot more than I do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I've used it but they're in school and they're figuring this out and you just -- you can just do it this way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's done and I'm saying, "Man, if it's -- they're this good now, what are they going to be given another ten years or so?".
R:  I know.  I know.  
L:  So.
R:  It's going to be interesting [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.  It will.  I -- times -- times are changing rapidly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ah sometimes I think they're changing too rapidly but [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]  I agree.
L:  But -- no, ah, I would have to say that -- that as we go along, ah computers are going to get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more and more important, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that's evidenced now ah on a college level by the number of schools that are providing laptops.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right [NOISE].
L:  Ah it's fantastic and ah --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're going to become so dependent upon --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that and then moving all the way up to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the small computers that we carry with us, ah some of them now have the PDAs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah with telephones.
R:  Right.
L:  You know --
R:  Right [NOISE]
L:  -- and [LAUGH] they ah it -- the ball just keeps --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- speeding up and up and up you know --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- so I would --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- I would be in favor of that.  The other thing -- the other thing that I think it does is with that information [inaudible] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- going back here, the other thing that I think it does is no matter where you live, you have access to a tremendous amount of information.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Whereas if you lived in ah small town USA --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you had the local library.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Which might not have been very big.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now with computers, ah, you can tap into major libraries --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and get the information.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And ah I just -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I personally, I think it's wonderful.  So ... --
R:  I think so, too.  Sometimes I wonder, though, if it's going to make children more lazy you know because they don't actually have to go to a library and look through and find the call number and find the book, but I'm sure that, you know, it -- there's nothing --
L:  Well.
R:  -- really we can do, but --
L:  No.  And again, I -- I think you make an excellent point there.  Now, ah it used to be and -- and I'm going to digress for just a little bit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it used to be that if you were doing math, you know, you would do math in your head --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't know, let's just go ah six times six is thirty six.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, you know with the calculator you see it's six X six equal.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You don't have to do anything.  And the same way with the computer, you know that if you do this, this, this and this you can get the answer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that doesn't call for much ah on your part, much effort because it's so easily and readily available --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is both a boon and a bane [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I -- yeah, and that's true.  I -- I -- I mean I even notice that in -- in younger children how they don't have that ability to add and subtract and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, divide and -- in their heads anymore.  It's just --
L:  No.
R:  -- oh, let -- let me get my calculator or my palm out or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my phone out because it has a calculator.  And I'm just thinking, well, you might not get the exact number, but it doesn't hurt to try to figure it out in your head --
L:  No.
R:  -- so -- but --
L:  If yeah it's like some -- it's like some other things.  If -- and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah I think the analogy could be drawn here ah I don't know whether you wear glasses or not, but --
R:  N-n.
L:  -- if you -- if you needed glasses a little --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you'd use them and you know what, it's remarkable, you needed your glasses more and more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the strength increased --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the -- in those glasses, whereas --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- had you -- had you not -- and I'm not saying you're [LAUGH] you know absolutely not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- had you not, the strength would have remained.  The -- the exercise --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the ability to think through a mathematical problem --
R:  Right.
L:  -- would remain as opposed to hitting six X six equal.
