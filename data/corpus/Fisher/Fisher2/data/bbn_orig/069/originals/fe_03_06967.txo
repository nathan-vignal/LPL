L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Margaret.
R:  Hi, I'm Cathy.  I'm --
L:  How you --
R:  -- in Pennsylvania.
L:  Hi, I'm in, uh -- on Long Island.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I'm at Long Island.
R:  My husband's from that area so this will be nice. [LAUGH]
L:  Where's he from?
R:  He's from Brooklyn.
L:  Okay.  I'm a little fur- -- little further east than that. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, oh, okay. 
L:  I'm out in Huntington which is --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, out that way.  So, uh, computers and --
R:  Education.
L:  -- education.  Well --
R:  I -- I feel it's necess- -- I feel it's, uh, a positive thing, you can do more research.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, it's -- it's become a different way to do research.  I mean, you know, I guess, an easier way to sit at home and -- and -- and do it although, um, I sometimes find it very frustrating, you know.
R:  Well, that it is, too, because I -- I believe, too, if they're inexperienced with using the computer, it's going to take longer to find what they're looking for.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, but I -- I think it comes in handy at a pinch if they're unable to get to the library with -- without reference.
L:  Right, right.  Um, I don't know, I'm -- I've only been on the computer for, like, two years so my, [SIGH] you know, knowledge is gain -- you know, I mean, I'm gaining in -- in how to use it but, boy, when I can't, you know, get anywhere it just -- you know, it's frustrating.
R:  I know.
L:  You know, and I, um -- you know, like you go into one area and it's not quite what I, you know -- I'm looking for or, you know -- but for the kids, I mean, I have a twenty one month old that just likes to sit and play on it already.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, um --
R:  Starting young.
L:  Oh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- gosh, you know, she just --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  She sees -- she copies us but, um, you know, I still expose her to the library, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, I think --
R:  I feel that's necessary as well.
L:  Yeah, just the, um --
R:  Well, I have a teenage son and what I find --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that I don't like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is that, yes, he'll do his homework on the computer, he'll be researching but then he also has music playing in the background from -- that he downloads.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'm thinking, "How can you even study this way?" [LAUGH]
L:  But we -- I studied that way out of books --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, you know, I mean not --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I don't think as -- as much, um, 'cause I get very distracted, I need to focus but that's now, you know.  I mean, my daughter, um, actually -- well, I have a twenty one year old also --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she did not use the computer as much as she used books [NOISE] you know.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I mean, this --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  This was her -- you know, I mean, she typed up reports on the computer, um, but, um, you know, she -- she went to the library and physically liked to do the research.
R:  Well, I think that's wonderful.  I mean, if there's a choice I would sooner see them go to the library --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, because a computer, I think, can bring on some, uh, lazy tendencies.
L:  Yeah, and -- and, you know, the -- the -- the instant distractions of going to other areas [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh, right.
L:  -- and, uh, you know. [LAUGH]
R:  And being IMd, because I'll hear the little dings and I know my son's friends are IMing him.
L:  IMing.  Uh, instant messages, oh.
R:  Instant messaging him --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as he's saying he's doing his lessons. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, see I don't --
R:  So they're killing more birds with one little stone. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I -- see I don't even, um -- I don't even have that on, I'm sure I could put it on there but, um, you know, it's -- it's different, I mean, like you said, for the kids but, you know, as far as, like, you know, after hours, you know, like, you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- college students working into the night or, you know, uh -- or just, you know, having instant access, you know, to --
R:  Right.
L:  To information but, uh --
R:  I could see it being very useful in that aspect of it.
L:  Yeah.  But some of -- some of the pa- -- I mean, like, even when you do look up things [SIGH] how other subjects get listed underneath the topic you're looking for doesn't make sense to me.
R:  Well, that and you're ri- -- you're right.  You use a keyword, it could take you to any -- any type of site, even a porn site.
L:  Yeah, yeah, there's some crazy --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- weird things on -- on, uh -- you know, that have nothing to do with -- you know, I mean, I looked up Buddhism once and, [SIGH] you know, there were two or three key areas I could go -- you know, go into but the rest of them were just weird, you know.
R:  Off the wall.
L:  Yeah, weird and -- and junk and, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, but it -- it, um -- I mean, things are getting faster, there's more -- I mean, it does amaze me, um, how fast the information comes up, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that just, you know, for -- for anything that, um, you know, I'm looking at and, you know, I guess the -- the more you use it the better you get at it, like anything else. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.  But I -- I can see your point when you -- like you said, when you plug in something that you're looking for, doing a search on and other things come up but if you have younger kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- using the computer they're go -- if they go into that site they're going to say, "Well, this is what I did a search on and here is what I got".
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not saying all the information is legit.
L:  Right.
R:  Argh!
L:  I mean, books are very -- you know, it's very specific if you're going to -- hold on a minute [MN] -- excuse me.
R:  Bless you.
L:  If you're going -- you know, you're going to get it, you know, a topic and -- and, you know, you pick something out and -- and that's what it's on and -- or, you know, you pick several books out.  But, I mean, I know for me I'm like, "Oh, you know, this sounds interesting" and that and -- and the next thing you know a half hour, forty five minutes --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- has gone by --
R:  Yep, you're off on something else.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm off on something else but it's interesting, you know. [LAUGH] It --
R:  It is but it may not have to do with what you wanted but --
L:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I don't -- I can, um -- you know, we don't have, um , a CD ROM whatever thing and I haven't even learned how to, you know, like, read disks or download -- you know, I mean, it's very simple.  I'm sure by the time [SIGH] my youngest is, you know, in -- in kindergarten, I mean, I know they have 'em, um --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know.  I mean, first grade I don't know, I mean, gosh, I don't want to see kindergarten but, I mean, I've seen three and four year olds on it that blow me away.
R:  Well, I know and now, today, classrooms have computers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right in the classroom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- we have a, uh, special needs daughter with autism --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and she's in, uh, a special class but she also has her own computer to work on --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and they have the internet connection.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, um --
L:  And how does she take to that?  How does she take to the computer?
R:  Well, she -- she has her moments.  Sometimes she really likes it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- other times she doesn't.  We're trying to get the communication going, back from home to school through email so -- to help improve her writing skills --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- uh, but that's not been too successful [LAUGH] for us.
L:  Right.
R:  But I think in time it might be.
L:  Now, uh, along, like, with writing skills, I know my -- my father was pushing me, in fact I -- I have to get the program from him, typing skills.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I mean, I -- I'm still doing -- you know, like once in a while I'll use, like, eight fingers, you know, in hunt and peck but, um, you know, in -- in terms of that, you know, if -- if you get skilled in typing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, you can knock things off fairly fast --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and --
R:  And they also have online typing classes but --
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.  There's -- there's a search for you. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah!
R:  Online typing. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, because I'm going, um -- I'm starting school within the month and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's -- it's total -- I mean, like in -- okay, in that respect it's total correspondence, correspondence and email --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, so, I mean, I can't afford to truck back and forth to Connecticut to the school I want to go, you know, nor move there so, I mean, that is a -- a definite plus, you know, um, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there's, you know -- when I was looking at schools.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, a lot of information on that and, uh --
R:  And that is nice that you can do that through the internet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on bettering your education.
L:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  I mean, I'm -- I'm so thrilled to be going back to school and to be able to do it this way, you know, and it just, um [SIGH] -- you know, I was resistant about this computer thing and the little old doing them, like, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't need it and I don't want it.  Like, I -- I was finding myself getting stuck in front of it and, like, in terms of physical ac- -- activity -- you know, like, I grew up running around in the streets until, you know, it got dark and --
R:  Right.
L:  And, you know, like, there was -- and it's -- it's bad enough with the TV and -- and -- and getting, you know, uh, all these couch potatoes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It -- it --
R:  [MN]
L:  It's still something that I think has to be monitored.  How -- how old is your son?
R:  My son's sixteen --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so at that age where, "Don't tell me what to do", type of thing --
L:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it's like, "Oh, watch me".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, my -- my twenty one month old is like that.
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  What, are you kidding me? [LAUGH] My way. [LAUGH]
R:  This is true.  My [inaudible], that's right. [LAUGH]
L:  My way, I'm going to do and -- and --
R:  We know nothing. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And it goes on till, you know -- but it, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, I -- I also, um, um, of course, enjoy, uh, [inaudible] channeling all over the country, you know, and in correspondence and -- and stuff like that.  I mean, that amazes me.
