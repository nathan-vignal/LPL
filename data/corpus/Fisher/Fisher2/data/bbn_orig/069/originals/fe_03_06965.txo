L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, hi.
L:  Hi -- hi, I'm Clarissa.
R:  Hi, I'm Pat --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- from Arizona.
L:  Hi, Pat.  I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  Oh my goodness, you guys have been getting rain.
L:  Um, well, it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We've had about a week and a half of sunshine --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- and, uh, it has started raining tonight.
R:  Oh dear.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no rest for the weary.
L:  [LAUGH] But, you know what, I'm not complaining though because usually it's the opposite this time of the year.
R:  Uh-huh.  So you're usually pretty dry this year, aren't you?
L:  Uh, very, yes.
R:  Yeah.  Well, good for you.  Well, I think -- I don't know -- I -- I -- this is my first one of these but I think, uh, computers are fairly good in -- in schools.
L:  I do, too.  Yes, very, um -- very useful tool, um [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh --
R:  I --
L:  -- I have a three year old --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that is already wanting to get on it --
R:  Oh, yeah, I know.
L:  -- and play on it.
R:  Yeah, my six year old, I can't get her off of it enough but you say, you know, it's like do you encourage it or you disencourage it?
L:  Yeah, right. [LAUGH]
R:  It's one of the fine lines.
L:  It's -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's better than, uh, sitting in front of the TV --
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it's better than, uh, video games --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- so as long as you can put some education --
R:  Behind it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree.  I totally agree, I think it's --
L:  Yeah, um, I think that kids, um, obviously not even just, um, like PCs [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but just the toys that are computerized --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that they have for babies, you know, I think that that's why our children are so much [LAUGH] smarter than we were.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they can do the, uh, uh, VCR long before I can --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- which is pretty sad. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Very sad --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- is what it is. [LAUGH]
L:  And like leap pad or leap frog --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with all of their computerized --
R:  Oh yeah, it's amazing.
L:  -- uh, reading tools.  Yeah, they make learning fun --
R:  Uh-huh, I know.
L:  -- and that's what it's all about.
R:  It would be nice if we would have had that when we were kids.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Might have enjoyed -- might have enjoyed going to school.
L:  That's right, there --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I have -- I have, uh, a godson that is, um, fifteen --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, he, um, is working for his computer teacher and, you know --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- when he's here or when he's at home you can't get him off the computer, that's all he wants to do --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, we -- we kinda think, "Oh gosh, is he ever going to come out of there?" but, yeah, it's, you know, this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- may be what he does for a living, so --
R:  Yeah, exactly and if pays good, then it's all right, you know.
L:  That's right, that's right.
R:  There's nothing wrong with that.  I --
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, I could see why they could probably -- maybe some kids would be non socialized or something like that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I think that's probably the exception not the norm.
L:  Then again, he -- he sits on the computer and talks to all his friends --
R:  Uh-huh.  I know --
L:  -- so --
R:  -- isn't that amazing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You and I used to pick up the phone --
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- and tie up our ki- -- our parents' phone --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but then again they tie up their computer phone -- uh, parents', uh, phone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if they only have one line [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Right, exactly.  It's like argh! 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No way around it.
R:  [several inaudible words] coming back, I know.
L:  That's right.
R:  No way to get around it, exactly.
L:  That's right.
R:  Exactly.
L:  We all have our challenges --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just different challenges.
R:  That's right.
L:  [SIGH] [LAUGH]
R:  Kids are the same, mhm, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly, exactly.
L:  But -- but then again you think about, like, the other schools that aren't as fortunate as it sounds like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe yours and ours --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that doesn't offer -- or doesn't have the money to have computer labs.
R:  Yeah [SIGH] and that -- that's sad, I mean, I -- I don't know if there's a way -- you know, what they do about that but, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it'd be nice if we could have that --
L:  For everybody.
R:  -- available to everybody --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know, in a perfect world, I guess but --
L:  Un --
R:  -- still --
L:  Well, un- -- unfortunately some of us just come out luckier than others, I guess.
R:  I know.  And there's still kids who still, you know, proceed -- you know, who still succeed in spite of all that, so there you go.
L:  That -- well, that's right, that's very true.
R:  And obviously we did so --
L:  That's right. [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] there's got to be a way round it --
L:  That --
R:  -- we just don't know what it is. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's right. [LAUGH] [NOISE] So you just have one ...? [NOISE]
R:  I have two, I have a six year old and a two year old.
L:  Oh, goodness. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I'm on my toes all day long.
L:  You're busy.
R:  All day's long --
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Well, you know, 'cause yours --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yours is three -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [NOISE] 
R:  -- it doesn't change.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Everyone's like [inaudible] all the time.
L:  That's -- that's -- that's right, that's right.  So --
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  -- um, does your six year old go to school yet? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, she's, uh, uh, getting ready to go -- she'll go to first grade now and next year.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So she's finished, she just finished, in fact she graduates from kindergarten --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- on Wednesday.
L:  Oh.
R:  I know.  I'm like, I'm going to cry. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  My husband's like, "Please don't", I'm like, "I know I am".
L:  [LAUGH] Of course, you will.
R:  Yeah, yeah, you're supposed to.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so -- so you -- she graduates on Wednesday --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- so you're not out for the summer?
R:  Yeah, no, no, I -- I work in the school district as well for high school kids --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- um, and we're down, we've been down for about two weeks which is kinda nice, I've had just -- just one child for a coupla weeks. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, "Oh yes, now what do I do with myself?"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but it's kinda nice, I felt funny but, uh, it's kinda nice for a change of pace --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to only have one child.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you stay at home?
L:  I do.
R:  Well, good for you.
L:  I do.
R:  Good for you, I wish I could do that.
L:  I do, um --
R:  Good for you.
L:  -- and she goes to pre school at a Methodist church and --
R:  Oh, isn't that nice.
L:  -- of course, we're out for the summer and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now I'm like, "Gosh, what are we going to do all summer?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] How do I entertain them?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH] Did that.
L:  [MN]
R:  My oldest went -- where I work they have an on site preschool with -- and the teenage kids come in and they do their child, uh --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- life and stuff like that with them --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- and they're entertained like constantly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I'm like, how do you compete with that, you know?
L:  That's great.
R:  There's no way.  I know, it's awesome --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but then once they're out for the summer you [LAUGH] -- you're just like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- argh! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly, I know, it's culture shock.  What do we do? [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Now what I -- how do I entertain these guys for ever?  I know --
L:  Well, that's neat that they have that for the kids.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah, and it's -- it's a great thing.  I mean, they do just awesome stuff with them so -- which is good. [MN]
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  And the kids love it.
L:  I think -- yeah, I think that they need to do more of that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- kind of thing in high school --
R:  Mhm, mhm. [MN] Oh yeah, I know, I agree.
L:  -- also.
R:  [MN] I -- I would wonder what their pregnancy prevention rate is on it, I don't know it exactly [MN] but it can't be, uh -- I'm sure it has prevented some somewhere along the line.
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  Uh [LAUGH] --
L:  Realized --
R:  If I got stuck -- [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh my gosh, oh my --
R:  If I got stuck with twenty five --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, five year olds --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I'd be crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, and -- and just --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- realizing that, oh gosh, this is only an hour but twenty four hours --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Non stop, exactly.
L:  [MN] My godson, he lives in Tennessee and, um -- and they did it here in Georgia also where they had the babies with the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  With the computers inside.
R:  That cry?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, those are so cool.
L:  That is very cool, that is very neat.
R:  I pity the -- I know, the people are sleeping with them but ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah --
R:  [inaudible] tough but it's -- they are nice.
L:  -- that's what my aunt said.  My aunt said, "Oh my gosh, I had to -- I felt sorry for him --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- so I got up in the middle of the night [LAUGH] and helped him". [LAUGH]
R:  But you can't do that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, isn't that funny?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We do all that and I know, that's the whole -- you [inaudible] the whole point but that's okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What are you going to do, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] I know, but --
R:  What can you do?
L:  -- she's so motherly, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.  It's that whole thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  That's great.
R:  So ...
L:  Now this is the second one that I've done, second call that I've taken.
R:  Is it?  This is my first one.
L:  Yeah, and, um, my first one was probably just a week ago.
R:  Was it?
L:  And they called me at another time and then I couldn't do it --
R:  Couldn't do it?
L:  -- so this is actually my third call.
R:  Oh wow, wow.
L:  So ...
R:  Now, how did you find out about it?
L:  Um, Money and Shopping --
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  -- on the internet.
R:  Huh, that's a new one, I haven't got.
L:  And, um, I just got an email about it 'cause I do secret shopping things.
R:  Uh-huh, I do that, too, yeah.
L:  Yeah, and it's great, I mean --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- you know, 'cause it gets out of the house for a free lunch somewhere and -- or whatever.
R:  Uh-huh, I know [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I just found the one that did my local grocery store.  I'm like, "Yes!"
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] lunch.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  Um, I guess I could be a lot busier if I, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- pursued it but, um, you know, it just takes time.
R:  But that's okay.  Yeah, and it -- it's hard to do, too, with little ones running around.  And, I mean, it's possible but it's more difficult --
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  -- with -- with the kids. [LAUGH] It's a lot easier without them.
L:  Right, right, it is, it is.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  But, you know --
L:  Hey --
R:  -- it's a good thing though. [MN]
L:  Yeah, it gets you out of the house and earning some money.
R:  How long you been doing the mystery shopping?
L:  Um, not too long, maybe a --
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, maybe, like, four months.
R:  Oh wow, yeah, it's --
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, that's about how long I've been doing it, too.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Huh.  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  I -- I like it, though.  It -- it's a good way -- like you say it's a good way to get out of the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then maybe introduce you to somewhere that you probably wouldn't normally go to.
R:  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I like about it.  Like, you know, we don't always just go out for dinner very often.
L:  Right.
R:  Int fact, we almost have to schedule it anyway just, you know, the whole babysitter and --
L:  Right.
R:  Ya de ya ya.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  It's like, "Okay, we know we have to do it this day --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- we don't have a choice".
L:  Right.
R:  "There's no backing out", you know.
L:  Yeah, that's great. [LAUGH]
R:  It's kinda crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  That's a good thing. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, exactly, crazy --
L:  Makes you go --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause sometimes you won't --
R:  I know.
L:  -- especially leaving 'em, you think, "Oh, well".
R:  Right, yeah, exactly, "I got a million other things I could be doing" and --
L:  That's right, right.
R:  You know, that whole line story.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's always that way, sad but true.
L:  Uh-huh, but that's okay.
R:  Sad but true.  Yeah, exactly.
L:  It's so -- so, it's been quiet on your end.  I can't believe that you haven't had somebody come calling ya.
R:  Uh --
L:  Any babies. [LAUGH]
R:  No, they're -- they're all out back.  I have two six year olds right now and they're taking the two year old.
L:  Oh.
R:  So [MN] --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- they're good for that.  I had to pick them all up from school so --
L:  Oh, that was perfect timing.
R:  -- they're all --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  So they're all -- they're all in the backyard playing with the sprinkler [MN].
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I have the sprinkler running so --
L:  So, it's --
R:  -- they're -- they're running crazy. [NOISE]
L:  It's pretty warm there?
R:  Uh-huh.  About a hundred and five. 
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my --
R:  But there's no humidity really, I mean it's pretty dry.  A hundred and five's not bad, I mean it's hot, don't get me wrong --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- but it's not -- I mean, it's tolerable.  Once it hits a hundred and ten, forget it, it's all over. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I mean, it's like, "Screw it, I'm not going out the house --"
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  "-- we're just staying in today". [LAUGH]
L:  No, you have to.  Now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if it's a hundred and five here you don't even want to step out of your house here 'cause of the humidity.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you have so -- so much humidity.
L:  Oh, it's awful.
R:  Yeah, I know, I know.  I'd like it [inaudible]
