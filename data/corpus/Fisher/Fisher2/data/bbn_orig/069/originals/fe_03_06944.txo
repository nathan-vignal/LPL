R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, this is Kristin.
L:  Hi, Kristin.  I'm Jeff.
R:  Hello.
L:  I live in Ohio.
R:  Okay.  I'm living in Minnesota.  I'm a college student and I go to school in Wisconsin.
L:  Okay.  Well, I'm a middle aged claim representative, so [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  It's, ah, what I do.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, this is gonna be difficult for me.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because the topic is what, computers in education?
R:  Yep.  Are you for 'em or against -- or does it harm it or enhance it?
L:  Um, I don't think it does anything but enhance it.  In my mind.  Um, I have limited computer knowledge but, you know, just the World Wide Web just opens up a whole gamut of information.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  It's -- I dunno, I dunno what I'd do at school without a computer.
L:  Right.  But there again, on the con- converse at that, my son, who is seventeen, just had a report to do and he goes on and logs on [PAUSE] something like Scarlet Pimpernel summary, reads the summary and does a report.  So --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause --
R:  Well, that's the part that's bad, that people would[?] abuse it.
L:  You know, thirty years ago, when I went to school, I'm sure I did the same thing.  And, of course, in college I bought cliff[?] notes.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  The old yellow and black things.  So.  It's always been there, hasn't it?
R:  Yep.  It sure has.  It's just easier now with a computer around.
L:  Right.  But, ah, you know, it -- it's just, well, since the computer and thinking of education, just my own personal education, um, I thought I was suffering from migraines and I go on and, you know, search migraine and, sure enough, you know, it pops up all the symptoms and then I [NOISE] take that, along with a diary of when and how I got these migraines, and the doctor says, "Yep, I think you're right".  
R:  Oh.
L:  But for years, I treated for sinus headaches.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So, you know, that and -- it's just -- just the wealth of information out there.
R:  In learning to use it at -- I'm, ah, going to school for engineering and there's pretty much -- engineering's totally different from it was twenty years ago because you can use computers to, I mean, draw up pictures of things and simulate different things and, I dunno how, if technology would not have advanced at all, had there not been computers --
L:  Right.
R:  So, my point there.
L:  Exactly.  Ah, well, twenty years ago I sold computers --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And personal computers.  You know, they had fifty six K of memory and -- and the thing that I sold was something that architects could use just to plot, um, [PAUSE] like, land.
R:  Yep.
L:  And it was so slow and I'm sure, I mean, I just built a house and, you know, that's nothing.
R:  Mm.
L:  Now.  It's just unbelievable.  So, it -- it's out there and it's definitely a big plus.  And we just might as well get used to it and use it.  
R:  Do you think the Internet's getting out of control for kids now?
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Of course.  But what do ya do?  You know, I guess the parent- parental controls that you can put on helps some.  But it doesn't help completely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  In those regards, obviously, it's not right.
R:  Yeah and it doesn't help, the time being spent on a computer, [inaudible].
L:  Oh, I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I, ah, I wish my son had a nickle for every minute he's spent in these chatrooms.
R:  [LAUGH] Huh.
L:  Yeah.  It just [PAUSE] but he's home.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know, I -- wh- -- there again, it's -- he could be out drinking and partying, so.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  But, well.  That -- that's, ah, a two way street, I guess.  Just like everything else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, what do you study?
R:  Um, electrical engineering.
L:  Obviously there's tons of stuff [inaudible] out there about -- about that.
R:  Yeah, you need to get product information online and all kinds of --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mm.
L:  My sister in law's brother is in his Masters program at Ohio University for electrical engineering. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Fortunately for us, we were having problems with our computer and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we give him our [PAUSE] -- is it the CPU, the tower?
R:  Yep.
L:  Two days later it comes back and works great, you know?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's been a big plus for us.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And, as I said, just +built a new house and he helped us [NOISE] get wired up, he's a [inaudible] with that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But as far as I'm -- go, I have very limited, but, you know, we -- we sell some things on Ebay and stuff like that but, um, [PAUSE] I don't even touch the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that I could use. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's for sure.  Even if I had a job to or a time to do it, I'm sure I would but just not right now.
R:  I understand.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  I sit in front of computers about eight hours a day right now because I'm interning, so ...
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  
R:  So, I'm used to sitting in front of one. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's -- that certainly is a way of doing that.  But when they announced the -- the subject, I was like, "Come on, how could you not think that it would be a good thing for education?"
R:  [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH] 
L:  So, this is my third go round in this.
R:  Oh, just my first here.  
L:  [NOISE] Oh, is that right?
R:  Yep.
L:  Well, it, ah, I want to go ahead and get my side of it past and -- and move on and just -- they call at a very inconvenient time for me.
R:  You can call it off too, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE] Yeah.  But I -- when I committed I signed up for -- for five and I'll muddle through.
R:  [LAUGH] Huh.
L:  Ah, that's for sure. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, now we have to [NOISE] -- I guess this is a linguistic study and I really don't, well, have anything more to say about computers in education.
R:  I don't know what else to say there about it, but [LAUGH]. 
L:  Yeah, well, sooner or later they'll pop and say, "That's the end of the thing.  You can say goodbye".  So, we'll do that and they can do their study and everybody's happy.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just get -- get to that point.  Well ...
R:  So, where do you live in Ohio?
L:  Southeast Ohio.  Right along the Ohio River.  Ah, basically half way between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it's very rural area and -- and, um, you know, if you had to sit through two stop lights, you're -- you're on edge because that's a big traffic jam.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Nothing -- no traffic, you know.  I live half hour from work and it's all drive time.  There's no [PAUSE] no stopping for traffic --
R:  Nice.
L:  -- at all.  So, that's good.  [NOISE] So, do you -- do you go to the University of Wisconsin or ...?
R:  I go to one of the University Wisconsin schools, one near Madison, Wisconsin.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It's not in Madison, it's near there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, pretty much just engineering students there and a couple of other majors[?] --
L:  I have a friend that lives in Madison.
R:  Okay.  It's a nice area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh, if you like Wisconsin. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  He likes it.  He's, ah, well, we met in San Antonio after work in the hailstorm[?] for a state farm and have kept in touch, but he likes the outdoor life.
R:  Well, that's the place to be.
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  It's really too humid down here.
R:  [LAUGH] Too humid?
L:  Yeah.  I think, we'll -- well, on a good day we'll have, ah, seventy percent humidity.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  Then we get up to a hundred percent quite often.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  It's been too cold here lately, it hasn't gotten over seventy degrees for a while.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Yeah, it's colder, that's -- what, sixty five, I think.
L:  Yeah, we've had some cold and rain here.  It's usually not this cold but--
R:  [LAUGH] I'm not gonna complain, outside it's been[?] a hundred degrees.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we'll get it, sooner or later.  Who knows?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [SIGH] So, yeah, let's continue to talk, I guess.  I -- I kinda figure the ten minutes would be up by now.
R:  I'm gonna check my watch.
