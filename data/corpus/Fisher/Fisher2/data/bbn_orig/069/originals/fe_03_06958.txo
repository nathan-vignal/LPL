R:  Hi, my name is Rochelle.
L:  Hi, Rochelle.  My name is Amanda.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm from Kansas.
L:  Kansas?  I'm in California.
R:  Oh. [MN] I've never been there.
L:  Oh, you haven't?
R:  No.
L:  Never been to Kansas. [LAUGH]
R:  I wanted to be but I haven't. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Well, it's an interesting topic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, computers in education since I worked for a -- an educational school that taught --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- computer learning for two years. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  So I think it's pretty important. [LAUGH]
R:  What did you see as the effect of using computers a lot?
L:  [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] Well, for our students what they were coming in to do -- they were coming to learn how to program computers --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- because they were finding that in this area of California, if you don't know how to do that you really can't get a job.
R:  Right.
L:  So they -- they would go through the whole program and learn --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just everything about computers --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everything and then unfortunately --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's when we had that big crash --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- and all the computer companies starting laying off --
R:  [NOISE] I see, so ...
L:  -- so that school that I worked for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually went bankrupt and closed.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, you have a little one?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  She's sitting here, oh, she doesn't understand why she can't eat a banana and then smear it all over Mommy's front.
L:  Oh, but why not, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- come on. [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess -- I guess Mommy just doesn't understand some things.  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] -- she's okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] She's okay?
R:  Yep, she's sitting on Mommy's lap now.
L:  Oh.
R:  But that was, like, higher education, college level stuff, right, at least?
L:  That's true, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think, mm, well I don't know, it's a broader question, it's really [NOISE]--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the effect of computers on education depend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Depends where you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- bring them in [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, how you're using them. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And how much, too, because [NOISE] I grew around the com- -- around computers since I was seven years old which I think was good but I wasn't constantly, constantly using the computer, I just --
L:  Oh, good point, yeah.
R:  There were times when I -- you know, I had time to play around and explore them and I, uh, taught myself how to use Microsoft Word from a young child but -- but it wasn't -- I don't know, I guess I think they're a really good tool but a very bad master and if you do -- I think it can be done in a way where you make children too dependent on a computer to do their thinking for them instead of --
L:  Right.
R:  Instead of being able to operate and master things themselves.  I don't know if that makes sense or not --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but I -- I see a balance there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I can see -- I can see that 'cause I -- I grew up around computers as well since both my parents were engineers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but we didn't -- [LIPSMACK] you know, it's like we went to school and we had a few programs that were on the computer, we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, we learned how to type --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but now it's like all of the learning -- you know, it's like okay, your kid's home from school, put 'em on the computer to start learning stuff --
R:  Right, it's constant.
L:  -- and it's almost turning into like a video game type thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like an addiction.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I could totally see that.
R:  Yeah, exactly, that --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  That's what I was trying to say, is -- it's just a constant thing and I think that's detrimental just because it's out of balance, you know.
L:  Definitely.  I mean, the kids should be out playing, [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- I think, you know.
R:  And, you know, I got to do that, I didn't sit on the computer --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- instead of playing outside.
L:  No, I never did that.
R:  And -- and I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  I think that's -- I think that's wise, I don't -- computers --
L:  Well, uh, yeah, I'd have to agree because --
R:  They're such a good tool and yet a bad master.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess -- I guess I have to come back to that 'cause that's what I'm thinking, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  And you think of -- you know, I think of my dad's friends, all the computer engineers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who, uh -- some of them had very little social skills --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I think that's probably because they spent all their time with the computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, yes, they were unbelievably intelligent but there comes a balance, like you were saying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They need to be able to interact with humans. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, exactly, I mean --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- you want your child to have a life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not just an education.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Are you still there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay, cool.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Cool, cool.  So where are you right now?  Are you at work?
L:  Mhm, I am at work.
R:  Okay.
L:  I -- I work on computers all day. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Cool, cool.
L:  So --
R:  Well --
L:  I work for a different school now. [MN]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm, so I know computers in education. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, tell me -- hm, yeah.
L:  How did you hear about this study?
R:  I got an email.  I actually, um, signed up for a thing where some time ago I paid thirty dollars and I got a list of websites where I could register to, um -- that's kind of a high price but I got a list of websites where I could go and register, give them my name and some of them will either pay me or give me, like, points to do surveys and stuff.
L:  Okay, yeah. [MN]
R:  And there are a lot of them out of there, some of them are worth more than others, some of them are absolutely worthless --
L:  Mm [MN].
R:  -- but, um, there are some that are good.  I really like Harris Poll, Harris Poll dot com is cool.
L:  Okay.
R:  But, um -- and that one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you earn points and you can redeem the points either for cash or for good quality stuff so, I mean, that one's a really good one.  I -- I got an email about this study and I think it was a result of -- of all the going through and registering at different websites I did from that.
L:  Okay, well, that's cool.
R:  How did you find out about it? [NOISE]
L:  I actually -- it's kind of an interesting thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is that I have a big group of friends that subscribe --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to this one magazine that -- where we can chat online --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and we post when we find good deals and it --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  It's usually like -- like shopping good deals but this was one such a particularly easy way --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make a little bit extra money --
R:  Yeah, no kidding.
L:  -- that they posted about this and I thought, "Well, this looks fun".
R:  Talking is easy. [LAUGH]
L:  Talking is easy, I can still work on my computer.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's cool.
L:  Yeah, it's a really --
R:  It's really cool.  So, what magazine is it that does that?
L:  It's called Refunding Makes Cents.  I don't know if you ever heard of it?  It's more -- it's --
R:  Refunding or defunding?
L:  Refunding like, um [LIPSMACK] -- it's like a combination of people that -- we use coupons a lot --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then we mail in for the manufacturer rebates and then this -- this woman has this magazine and she compiles all that information each month.
R:  But that's cool.
L:  It's re- --
R:  I love doing stuff like that.
L:  Oh, really?  You should check up.  Do you want the website?
R:  Yeah, what's the website? [NOISE]
L:  The website is W.W.W.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  And then it's refunding, the whole word's --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- spelt out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- makes, just M.A.K.E.S. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- cents, which is C.E.N.T.S. --
R:  Mm, that's a --
L:  -- dot com, like -- like money cents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then you can just -- you can kinda browse around and then if you actually subscribe then you get to the online part which is called chitchat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and that's where people just post like crazy, just all the free stuff they find.  It's really -- it's really like --
R:  That is cool.
L:  I mean, it's -- I think it's like twenty six dollars a year and I must save like hundreds of dollars [LAUGH] a month.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I can't even believe it.  I don't know why everybody doesn't do it.
R:  Well, I -- I think I do.  I think people [MN] are too busy to think about but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it is true, you can save [NOISE] so much money.  Manufacturers offer so many rebates and --
L:  Tons.
R:  -- so much stuff and only a small percentage of people actually take advantage of it but --
L:  Totally.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm doing probably about two hundred dollars worth of rebates a month --
R:  You're kidding.
L:  -- and -- just rebates.
R:  Is it stuff that you need?  I mean, you're not just buying stuff for the rebate are you?
L:  No, like I -- it's like Windex and, like, food.  Yeah, like, when I first started that was -- that's -- I think it's a common beginner's mistake 'cause I was buying things that I didn't really need that much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and now it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I figured out how to do it 'cause you kinda have that learning curve and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I only buy things that either I'm going to use or pass on to my sister --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- since she's trying to get started.  So I'll buy stuff for her, too.
R:  Cool.
L:  And it's just total fun.
R:  That is neat.  I will -- I will definitely go check that out.  I just wrote it down.
L:  Oh, cool, yeah.  I think it's --
R:  Yeah.  So, computers figure into our education --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- by the fact that --
L:  We save so much money.
R:  -- firstly, I got an email telling me about this study --
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.
R:  -- you found out about it from your online chitchat thing, Refunding Makes Sense, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- continuing computer education. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I think it's a big thing. [LAUGH] You see, it's good that we know how to use computers, we were taught how to use computers.
R:  Oh, I tell you, it's such [NOISE] an open door of opportunity and it's such a window on the world, I mean, [LIPSMACK] and that doesn't mean that everything -- I don't know, I like to know where I'm going --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in using the internet and stuff because there -- there is, you know, as everyone knows, there's trash out there and destructive stuff, too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, at the same time, um, there's so many good opportunities, if you use commonsense there's -- you can -- it's just a window on the world.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But [NOISE] --
L:  Totally.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I remember when the internet was so small and now it's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- this huge thing.
R:  When did you start using the internet?
L:  Um, about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'd say right when I started college.  I started using it in nineteen ninety ... when was that?  Nineteen ninety four.
R:  Really? [NOISE]
L:  So it wasn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, it just wasn't that big yet and I --
R:  You're kidding?  I bet we're the same age.
L:  Well -- how old are you?
R:  Now, see I didn't start college that year but that's the year I would have graduated from high school. [NOISE]
L:  That's the year I graduated from high school.
R:  I'm twenty seven.
L:  Yeah, I'm twenty six.
R:  [NOISE] Wow.
L:  Yeah, same -- how funny.
R:  How cool. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  So, you started using it then?  I started -- I didn't ever use the internet until ninety eight so that was -- that's a big difference. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and that's kinda when it started --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually being much more functional.
R:  Right.
L:  It wasn't too functional before.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, it was like, it was just like stupid stuff out there and people could just -- there was no regulation at all, you know.
R:  Like a weird bulletin board where everyone just pops up whatever they want?
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  And it was mostly -- I think it was more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- used for people that would want to chat with other people --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- but I didn't do any of that 'cause that was in school.
R:  And technology geeks, probably. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, totally.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's about it.
R:  [LAUGH] So, would you -- I mean, um --
