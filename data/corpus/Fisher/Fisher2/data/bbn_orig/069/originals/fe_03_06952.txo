L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, are you?
R:  [MN] Okay, hi.  I'm Beverley.
L:  Hi, Beverley.  Can you hear me all right?  I'm on a speaker phone.
R:  Oh yes, I can hear you.
L:  Wonderful.  Well, I guess -- my name's Cher and I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Where are you from?
R:  Oh, I'm from Manhattan, from New York City.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Do you know, I've never been to Manhattan.  I've been all over the world but not to Manhattan.
R:  Oh.
L:  Do you use a computer?
R:  Well, I just started.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've had them in my classroom but for various reasons they weren't working very well --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so we just finally started using them.
L:  Oh, I think once you [NOISE] teach yourself ... if you teach yourself you'll learn it better and you'll love it, you'll just love it.
R:  Well, I know my students are having a ball claiming they're teaching me what to do. [LAUGH]
L:  They just [inaudible].
R:  They've been using these things for years --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so they're really good.
L:  Oh, they certainly are and I think they really improve education considerably because my sister is a teacher and she [NOISE] told me what type of computer to buy and so forth and so on and, like you said with your students, my grandchildren are teaching me.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I love it.  I -- I get so much accomplished in such a smaller amount of time.  The average school child these days has so many chores and so many responsibilities, so much schoolwork and everybody's traveling round the world with everybody, all of the educated children have to get to libraries, back and forth, back and forth, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  That's true and with the libraries having cuts in their hours and nothing is really available at certain times of day.  It -- it really works for the children to have their own computers.
L:  I really think so, too, and even if they don't have the finances to be able to afford them, when the library is open they can run to the library and use the computer.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  I don't know if you've noticed but there are so many -- so many different websites [inaudible] to the teacher and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's -- it's really wonderful, I think it's a remarkable improvement because the way the world's going if you don't know how to use your computer [inaudible] to ask the knowledge that it's trying to convey to you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you're going to be lost by the wayside --
R:  That's true. [NOISE]
L:  -- and the child that doesn't know anything about computers isn't going to know what's going on.
R:  You know, it's gotten to the point where this is really something that's necessary, you know, and parents are making whatever kind of arrangements they can.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, it's no longer, "Oh, but it would be nice if we had it", now it's become, "Okay, what do we have to do to get this".
L:  That's true and I think it should be that way.  I'm -- I'm -- I really feel --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that our children are going to be able to meet the challenges much more efficiently once they have computer knowledge under their belt and I know the job market is much more widely available to --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, yes.
L:  -- the graduates, you know, that have had computer training --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of one sort or another.
R:  At one point I had noticed that so many jobs were requiring computer literacy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- even things that years ago that just wouldn't have been an issue.
L:  That's true, that's true.  I mean, even when they hire waitresses these days --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, and that used to be the easiest job that, uh, less educated persons would be able to get.  Now you have to know how to basically run a computer. [MN]
R:  It's true.  I mean, they have computers at registers now, even with places with McDonalds.
L:  You're right, so I really feel that anyone that doesn't have education or a background educational in -- or education in the computer field is going to definitely be lost and that's a shame.
R:  That's true.  Well, one thing I've noticed but specially with younger people from say the age of twenties on down, they don't have the fear of computers that many older people have.
L:  Right.
R:  They've been doing this for so long that, you know, they don't even think about it anymore.
L:  Now, that's true.  I know I had a mental block against even touching one for the first --
R:  I did, too.  I was so afraid of it.  When they talked about getting them in our room --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I thought, "Oh no, you know, I don't want to have to do this, I'll let the students do it". [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH] Right.  I think it's almost like driving a car.  If you put it off till you're older, it's more scary than it was --
R:  That's true. [MN]
L:  You know, the longer you put something off ... I
R:  I remember when my son started in elementary school, he's twenty seven --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it was such a big thing to him to, "Oh Mummy, we do this on the computers" and he would always come home and brag about it.
L:  And you didn't know what he --
R:  Now he works with them and he loves it.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I really feel that by the time you learn a little more, it -- it's amazing, you'll find, "How could I have done without this?"  It's just like the microwaves, when they first came out I didn't think, "What do I need a microwave for?  I'm a good cook".
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.
R:  I used to call it the most expensive popcorn popper I'd ever seen. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I make turkeys in mine now, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Ooh, now that sounds good.
L:  Yeah, I've made up to eighteen pound turkeys in it and the meat is much more tender and it's just like your -- the children in the education as far as the computer goes, you've got your child that will get himself to a library or read, even the one that is such an excellent student, reads extensively, without that computer to be able to pour in more material for him to gather information from --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- these sites to his, um, reports --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [inaudible] behind the last [inaudible] --
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  -- because of the accessibility to the knowledge that the computer would bring.
R:  Well, one thing we had to make very clear to the children is that we would not accept printouts of what they found on the computer for an assignment.  They really had to sit down and write what they learned --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because we were getting all kinds of printouts.  These children would just see something, print it up and bring it in.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You know, we had to explain that I -- you know, "If I wanted to see that, I could turn on the computer myself, okay.  I want to know what did you get out of it".
L:  You're right, you're absolutely correct.  I know that I had to work [NOISE] with my one grandson on that because he wanted to do exactly that.  He said, "Well, what's wrong with it?"  I said, "It's plagiarism" and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now I remember when we used to do book reports by copying from the dust jacket, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and for years we got away with it until we had a teacher who was wise enough to figure, "Oh no, I've seen these words before".
L:  Right, exactly, and when you know your students and you realize that's not their word usage and --
R:  That's true, and we would give ourselves away constantly.
L:  Yes.
R:  Most of us didn't think about rewriting them, using our own words, we'd just copy --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so when I see the students pulling that number with the computer, it's like, "Oh, no, no, no, I could have done this myself.  Don't even go there".
L:  You're right on that subject.  Boy, but, uh, I really -- I'm -- I'm happy about them, I'm so happy that I taught myself.  It's been a lot of trial and error but for one thing, when the grandparent learns -- I don't know how old you are, I'm a young retired grandmother, but, um -- when I say young, I'm under sixty [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But --
R:  Well, I'm pushing fifty so -- [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you're nice and young, you're a spring chicken compared to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But, uh, it -- it really is wonderful because it helps to bind and binds the different generations and --
R:  That's true.
L:  [inaudible] you've got your young child, like you said, in grade school, elementary school, junior high, and then the grandparent or the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- older aunts or even mom and the child, you know.  It -- it binds you together if you both know a little bit about it and especially no child will pass up an opportunity to try to teach mom something.
R:  That's right.  My students get so excited at the thought, "We can teach our teacher this" --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- even the ones that ordinarily would be like, "Oh, who cares" so, "Oh, I know how to do this, let me show you" [LAUGH].
L:  And the thing is, you appreciate it because they're not going to condemn you if you do one or two things wrong.
R:  Oh no, in fact they seem to get a kick out of it.  If I hit the wrong button, they'll laugh and say, "Okay, try it again" [LAUGH].  I said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Gee, I've heard that before, haven't I".
L:  Right, well my -- my son's even written programs to teach me how to use the computer when I first started --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I'd have to press certain things and he'd -- it -- the programs he'd write would kind of guide me through and they'd be so personalized, "Uh-oh Mom, you better read the statement and then go back and change your answer". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's great.
L:  He loved it because it was giving him a mental challenge at the same time he felt doing something really good for my mom and she does appreciate it.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  I really -- I really app- -- approve of it ten million percent.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I'm --
R:  It's such a good thing now.
L:  I think I'm a --
R:  I'm really glad to see that it's available.
L:  So am I, I am, too.  I have three computers in my home and there's only me and my dog here now.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I use them all.  When a newer one comes out, there's always more technology out there and the thing is, too, especially if -- if you've got handicapped children --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they -- what a marvel this is for them.  They can use the computer --
