R:  Hello, my name is Aquila[?].
L:  Hi.  I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
R:  Aquila.
L:  Aquila?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, my name is Marta.
R:  Hi.
L:  Where are you, Aquila?
R:  I'm in Atlanta.
L:  One more time?
R:  Atlanta.
L:  Oh, Atlanta.  Okay.  Well, we're not that far.  I'm in Charleston, West Virginia.  So, we're both in the South East.
R:  Oh yeah, wow.
L:  Yeah.  Now, the topic is what countries do we consider to be a threat to the US?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Well, I -- I think that personally I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think that list is ever growing and ah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't think it's ah -- I don't think you can discount anybody except for maybe the NATO allies, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that's about the only ones that you can [MN] trust.  I mean, I don't think England [LAUGH] is going to attack us any time soon, but I think that we really need to be careful of -- of any country that has ah -- ah definitely an Al Qaeda connection.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And ah you know, some of these [SIGH] North Korea, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is -- is -- is a very, very scary thing.  Um, you know, there's a lot of these countries that have some great aspirations and some um some questionable tactics, don't you think?
R:  I agree.  I think for the most part like the ones you mentioned, just because, you know, [LAUGH] previously they've done stuff before so it kind of shows that they're not scared to do so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But at the same time, I don't really think the countries individually could do too much --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I'm more concerned about if they then decide to come together eh, you know the countries that maybe --
L:  True.
R:  -- are in disarray with the US right now come together and do something.  Now, that would be a concern, but as far as like countries individually, um, besides the two you mentioned, I -- I agree with just those two for the most part.
L:  Well, I hadn't thought about the -- the -- them forming a coalition.  That --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is definitely a scary thought.  And you know --
R:  Well, I only say that because like, I mean, just thinking about when it all happened and when they announced that we were going to go to war and, you know, like just all the countries that were like, you know, we're not in agreement and how especially like France -- and they were supposed to be our ally -- and they were like kind of get other countries to join in with them to go against the US and I'm like, "That is not cool", you know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, I mean just the fact that they would even consider doing something like that, other countries would even consider sitting down to listen to that, and I'm like, "Wow, you know, these countries could probably really try to team up, that's not good".
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah and a lot of those countries in the Middle East, they -- some of them are sort of silent, like Syria.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But let's face it, that -- that country or that region is so oil rich that there's enough money in each of those countries that they could -- they're all [inaudible] countries.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  They may not have the manpower, but they sure have the money that they could, you know, ah influence enough [LAUGH] I guess people to ah -- to pick up arms and I guess, you know, they could, you know, if they united enough of the Arab States they could be a threat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you, when you were talking, another country that sort of entered my mind that has never really been super friendly toward us ah and certainly in terms of size, both in population and geography, is China.
R:  Wow.  Yeah, you're right.
L:  You know.  'Cause we've always had some difficulties there.  It's -- it's always been lukewarm, it's never been a real warm ah reception --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- there, you know.  It's always been sort of cool, I guess, is really is what I meant to say.
R:  That is so true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  And as big as they are, that would be kind of scary.
R:  Yeah, that probably wouldn't be the best.  And then, I mean, considering like a lot of the countries we're attacking now, they're kind of close to countries that even if they're not our allies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're, you know, they're not really bothered either way, but just considering that we're going to countries and they're so close to other ones, if something happens in one of those neighboring countries, they could decide to retaliate or, you know, the -- my main -- like I said, my major concern is -- is countries joining forces together [LAUGH].
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you know, I don't know about you, but I'm still fairly uncomfortable about the situation that currently exists even after this big military campaign in Iraq --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, I'm concerned that this is the second time that we've gone over there to take care of this dictator --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and we don't know where he is.
R:  Oh yeah, we still don't know that, do we?  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that's -- that I think is really kind of [MN] well, it's scary.  I don't know what it says about our intelligence --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  I mean, seriously, we -- we have all of these great technological gidgets and gadgets ah at our ah um you know beck and call --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and supposedly we were able to determine that, you know, he was in this building and that's -- that's why apparently the war began so early, because we had this intelligence that said Saddam Hussein was in this building --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and then, you know, we did this other major attack on this one building because we had this -- this report that he and all of his key people were in another building.  Um, and where are they?  And we certainly --
R:  That is very true.
L:  -- you know, there's been enough time that's gone past that they've been -- they should have been able to go through any DNA that they may have found you know in the building to determine where this man is.
R:  Hm.
L:  And ah I'm just not thoroughly convinced that he or some other Saddam clone can't go somewhere else in the Middle East and um, you know, stir up that same kind of passion and ah, you know, come back at us.
R:  Well, that's very true.
L:  If -- yeah.  I mean, you know, ever since nine eleven, I mean it's a different world.  You know, they've -- they've -- they've hit us where we live and, you know, I just don't think it would just ever be the same again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that we're always going to have these -- these terror alerts.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's very true.
L:  I just --
R:  And I mean, I didn't even think about that, because it just seems like, you know, first it was just like, well, you know, there's going to be a war and everybody's like, "Wow, we're going to war" and then once, you know, reasons came up and then, you know, it's like there was a focus, like, you know, "We're going against Saddam" and then I totally forgot all about that, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like they were looking for him and they was like, "Oh, we found him" they bombed the building.  I had totally forgotten about that because it seems like the focus is always diverted to something else.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, I mean, just -- you mentioned it, did we ever catch him?  I mean, that totally slipped my mind.  I would have never thought about that, just 'cause the attention was diverted to something else, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And now it's just like, we know, are the soldiers still over there, are we still fighting, are we still dropping bombs, what are we doing?  Like, nobody knows.  We just went over there, dropped a couple of bombs and now I'm -- I'm -- I'm still wondering like, what happened?  Are people still over there?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Are our soldiers still fighting?
L:  It's -- it --
R:  I don't know.
L:  You know, and then you -- you hear so many different reports, you hear on one hand that the people are so receptive to us --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but then have you noticed here lately all of these incidences of -- of a -- fatalities --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Where all of a sudden all that -- where are these Iraqis coming out of the woodwork --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with -- with guns and our people are dying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I don't know --
R:  That's true and that's why I -- I -- I did hear there on the news there like, you know --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- a couple of soldiers got killed and I'm like, "Are we still fighting?  What is happening over there?  Are they just like sitting in the hotel and somebody shooting?"  You know, what is happening?
L:  So, I mean I don't know if these are just pockets of really loyal people who are just, you know, I don't know, vigilants -- vigilantes or something, I don't know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ah I n- you know, I'm concerned about the -- the high incidence of that and I'm -- I'm wondering, was this all just a little too easy and are the real -- are the real armies hiding somewhere in the mountains waiting to come down?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know?  And it's --
R:  I -- I agree with you there.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's just like Osama Bin Laden.
R:  Mhm.
L:  How come we can't find him?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It just -- it amazes me that -- that one man could be so smart --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  You're right.
L:  Now, I understand that the terrain in Afghanistan is so um unusual and very severe, but I'm like, you know, come on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.  How -- how is it possible that one person could elude the entire world?  You know, and in the n- -- this is the other thing, and I'll shut up, 'cause I talk too much --
R:  No, you're fine.
L:  -- is -- is the people around him have got to be so incredibly loyal --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because I mean he's got an enormous price tag on his head.
R:  Yes.
L:  I don't know about you, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, would you not be thinking about, "Hm" you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Making a phone call, "I know where Osama is".
R:  Okay.  Let me help you guys out, you know.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, so he must -- he must change his people very regularly and you know, who knows what he does to them to change them or they must be incredibly loyal.
R:  Yeah and I -- I mean I -- like -- like I said, I get -- there's so much going on that it's like, well one thing's happened, when one thing happens all my attention's diverted that direction and like September eleventh, everything was diverted that direction --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now it's like, I had forgot all about that just because of this war with who --
L:  Right.
R:  -- he's woo, yeah --
L:  And you know that --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] who we're fighting with anymore.  Whoever we were just fighting with, for whatever reason.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean --
L:  But, clearly that may be the big thing.  It might be that people are forgetting about Osama and maybe we're getting sloppy, you know, and he might be right under our nose.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I had forgot about him and why did we do that, oh, September eleventh.  Yeah, I forgot about that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I had totally forgot about that.  And I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Because it seems like now we have just like so many people, we're just kind of like --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- fighting them before they fight us, kind of thing.
L:  Sure.
R:  So ...  I don't know. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But besides like, um, I think for the most part it -- it was
