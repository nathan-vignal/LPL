L:  [MN] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Cheryl.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  My name is Shelley.
L:  I w- where are you?
R:  In Lincoln, Nebraska.
L:  Okay.  I'm in San Antonio, Texas.
R:  Oh, oh my gosh.  My sister --
L:  Yeah, isn't that neat [LAUGH].
R:  I -- I have a sister that lives in Blanco [LAUGH].
L:  Are you serious?
R:  Yeah.  And her name is Cheryl [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, my goodness.  That is so odd.  That is so neat.
R:  That is neat.
L:  I guess this world is really small.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't even know what the question was, Shelley.
R:  It was, "Do you feel any other countries are a threat to the US and if so, what countries and why?"
L:  Oh.  Okay.  Here we go.  Okay.  [NOISE] When I heard the topic, I was like, foreign relations, why? [LAUGH] 'Cause I just -- I don't know, it's just a sensitive subject, it just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's really sensitive.  Have you done one of these calls before?
R:  No, this is my first.
L:  Okay.  Mine too.  Okay.  You can go first.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] Well, I admit I don't know a whole lot about this subject, I really try not to listen to too much of what's going on just because it's disturbing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, I know the basics of what's been happening, but I don't read the paper about it, or --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and then what I do hear I just hear on the news, I don't watch special topics on it [SIGH] um, but I would say overall I'd still would say that um Iraq is still a threat, um the people there are grateful that we've [SIGH] you know, done what we've done, they didn't want -- it's funny, 'cause they didn't want us there to begin with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then when we got there and saw what we were doing, it was, "Well, where have you been?" you know, "It's about time you got here" [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, and but now that we've done what we've done, now they want us back out and, you know, let us take over and do what we need to do, but the -- the worry is is that without some type of order or structure it's just going to -- they're going to keep following in the same cycle, you know, if someone undesirable will take over 'cause they've got the manpower and they've go the weapons and they'll, you know, shove out anyone else who wants to be a leader and so I think until all that's taken care of, they're still a threat.  Not of our country necessarily, but of possible future problems that we've seen in the present. [PAUSE] That's what I think [LAUGH].
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, thanks.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I [LAUGH] I don't even know if I watch the news that much.  I really have tuned out totally, to tell you the truth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have [inaudible] as to what any details as to what's going on, I literally do not watch the news um I do not read the paper, um, any news or anything that I get I get on my cellphone and it's for specific events.
R:  Right.
L:  Other than that, I don't get anything.  Um, and that's just something I've done like in the last year, literally.  When people started talking about um the girls that were kidnapped, that was like a couple of months ago, they were saying that one of the -- er one girl was found, like with [inaudible] and they're like, you have had to known about these girls, I'm like, "No, because I really don't watch the news".
R:  Right.
L:  So, really, that's not something that I um, you know, I -- I -- I'm aware, but I'm not, I don't get into the details of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it and I really don't know who's a threat and who -- who's not a threat --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I know it really sounds ignorant, but it's just the truth because --
R:  Well and at this --
L:  I feel like, you know, I, I'm sorry, Shelley, because [inaudible] I was ah -- I went for um a while back for um what do you call it, for a temp agency and they did this ah test --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the test was like an essay, that's what it was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because it was for um a publishing company, the -- the job was for a publishing company, so they did this like essay and so um I wrote this entire essay was about basically about how the media hyped up oh so much stuff and how that's like a major pet peeve for me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, that it goes from one major event to another and I really despise that, I really don't like that.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, I get really um -- I just kind of stay away from that, a lot of the news that I do hear is second hand, which is -- is already second hand anyway, by the time it gets through to the ah American public, I think, that it's already second hand.  I mean, BBC news is just I -- I -- I'm trying to check that out from time to time to kind of see what's going on internationally, but um as far as just ah our news, I really shy away from that.  Um, I don't know if that's bad or whatever, but I just -- it's like, what's next?  Next year's gotta be a theme and it's going to be two, you know, it's going to be d- you know, the -- the whatever the summer scare is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the winter scare, or whatever, and I just don't feed into that.  I just believe that our lives are so much greater than um what we can be afraid of next.
R:  Right.
L:  I just have a big problem with that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, that you know I just don't get into that.  So, I'm sorry, what were you about to say? [MN]
R:  I don't know if I was [LAUGH].
L:  I heard you but, you were -- I heard you say like you were about to start to say something and then I stepped over it.
R:  Oh, when my daughter came out and I'm like, "Huh" --
L:  Oh [LAUGH].
R:  -- trying to stop her from yelling at me while I'm on the phone [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, well, um, that's really my blurb and I was like, um, foreign relations, couldn't they have given us one on hobbies or stuff like that?
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  You know, something that -- but I -- I don't know, I'm just -- I've really been a slacker on -- on that kind of stuff because ah just like, okay, you know, um, can you make it sound any worse than what it is?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I just um oh man, I -- I -- I really maybe that's something that -- that -- they say that if -- if something is a pet peeve to you that that's really where your gifting is.
R:  Right.
L:  And maybe that's something that I need to address, like in my lifetime, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Rewrite human history with a new kind of news, or whatever.
R:  Right.  See, that's how I feel about politics.
L:  Yeah, oh that's --
R:  I'm so disgusted with it [MN] and I just hate to hear about it, I just -- I don't -- I don't like politics.  I mean, I vote for people who go in office and things like that, I still vote, but the whole structure and the way everything works, I just can't stand.  And I -- I agree if -- if I just -- I always laugh, I say, "That's just what the world needs is ah Shelley the activist, because boy, look out" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Here she comes.
R:  That's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.  I sometimes think about that.  Yeah, what if I did turn activist and yeah, you'd really be in trouble.
R:  Really fight for some- yeah, really fight for something you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- who knows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what would happen.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.  Yeah, I um ah is this the time that you have set for them to give you a call?
R:  I think I did on Sundays from eight till eleven or something, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  I didn't really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think I'd get called because they, you know, are looking for men now --
L:  Yeah.  How did you hear about --
R:  -- and they kind of made it sound like they weren't really -- you could go ahead and sign up, but they probably weren't going to be taking any more new women and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I didn't really expect to get called [MN].
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm glad they did.
L:  So, how did you h- -- how did you hear about the ...?
R:  I'm actually signed up through ah a mystery shopping system --
L:  Me too [LAUGH].
R:  -- yeah, through mys- is it ah money and shopping?
L:  Money and shopping dotcom.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Me too.
R:  And I've -- I've been for a year now and I'm just now starting to get shops on a regular basis.
L:  Me too.
R:  So I was -- I'm -- I've been --
L:  Well, actually, I haven't even started --
R:  -- yelling at my husband every time I get on my email, "I got another shop" [LAUGH] so [inaudible].
L:  So -- so, how did you actually -- did you just have to start like with something simple, or how did you ...?
R:  The first shop I actually got was kind of a last minute one that they needed somebody for right away --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I kind of got my foot in the door like that.
L:  Okay.
R:  And completed one in just ah a weekend, that they needed it done by.
L:  Okay.
R:  And from there, I just recently got signed up with another company that personally sent me an email asking me if I would do this shop --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and because I was the only one in the address and that was to me, it said, "Dear Shelley" you know --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but um, and that was through Service Alliance Inc, SAI.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I'd just signed up with them and a week later they -- less than a week later they sent me an email --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- asking me if I could complete a shop.  So ...
L:  Y- -- are you -- are you -- is -- well, Lincoln, Nebraska's pretty -- that's a pretty big city, right?
R:  Um, we're right now we're about two hundred and fifty, just -- just starting to -- just
