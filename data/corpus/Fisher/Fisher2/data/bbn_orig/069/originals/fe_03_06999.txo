L:  Hello.  This is -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  -- Ramonic- -- hi.
R:  Hi.  My name's Susan.
L:  I'm Ramonica.
R:  Monica?
L:  Ramonica.
R:  Ramonica.  Oh, that's pretty.
L:  Yes.  Oh, thanks -- 
R:  Okay, we're talking -- we're supposed to talk about education --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and computers.
L:  Yes, and [LAUGH] well, I guess, I -- I, um, really wasn't clear to what about education and computers.  I mean -- 
R:  It asked if you think, ah, computers have helped or harm education.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Um, I think they've helped actually.  I mean, um, it's ac- -- actually helped my -- my -- I have younger children and they've actually learned a lot of phonics and things.  There are a lot of interactive games and things that they were able to do on the computer that helped them to, um, learn a lot faster than my older children.
R:  Oh, well, then you have something to compare it to.  I have, um, teenagers and I think it's helped tremendously because any subject at all they can look up on the computer.
L:  Yes -- 
R:  They can get pictures for their reports.  They can print those right there.  We don't have to go to the library and photocopy everything.
L:  Right.
R:  They can look up -- I -- I -- I mean, it's just to me incredible and they can make their report look wonderful by making the headlines and designs and little artwork all around repor- -- I mean, it's just fabulous.  I wish I had it when I was little.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, and -- and you're right.  It actually has helped because in that aspect I have, um, some, um, children that are in middle school and we went to the library looking for books on specific topics and we couldn't really find anything but, like you said, the internet allowed us to -- ah, you know, gave us access to a great variety of information that we probably wouldn't have been able to get, um, in -- had they not had computers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- 
R:  That's true.  I think it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wonderful.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know it does harm also in different respects but we haven't dealt with any of that here.
L:  And I -- 
R:  I mean -- 
L:  -- really don't -- I don't know anybody -- I don't know anybody personally that has had any problems as far as education goes.  I know other areas, um, the computer has been, um, not a -- hasn't had a [MN] -- a positive image.  But, as far as education goes, I mean, there's so many -- you know, there's so much software out there for everything.  You know, you want to learn maths, even foreign languages, all that -- 
R:  Oh, that's right.  That's right.
L:  You know, so -- so there's just a lot out there for it and -- and my children, like I said, they've -- they've been exposed to a lot of things because of computers that, you know, sometimes I may not have all the answers but we have the software or something that -- that just allows them to, um, build their knowledge in different areas. 
R:  Mine too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, I -- I don't know.  I find ed- -- I think it's really helped education in my opinion.  I think it's -- it's a great -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- asset.
R:  Yeah, I feel the same way and, ah --
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- I was going to say, the -- like the only harmful thing that we've noticed is that our school has said, you know, there might be a website that all the kids go to, to type in mean things about other students.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, the school is -- maybe it's not your education but certainly the education system -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is involved in -- in that -- 
L:  [MN] Well, could -- 
R:  -- has had to warn us all.
L:  Oh, well, I've never -- I've never heard of that.  That's interesting.  I've -- I've, ah, you know, I've been exposed to that, um, so that's really interesting [LAUGH] to know that that's out there also.  But, my children, like I said, they haven't been. exposed to that.  I also have one, ah, student that's in college.
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- and computers have b- been great for him in college.  You know, he has a lot of term papers and you know, everything that he needs to do he can do it on the computer.  I know -- um, I majored in computer science when I was in college but it -- the hardest thing for me was to be able to get access to a computer because they were all on a mainframe but now everyone has their own computer, you know, it -- it's just great.  I mean -- 
R:  Well, that is true.  I guess, ah -- that we have the one -- the access problem is that if my daughter's on it my son wants it and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's, ah [LAUGH] -- and of course they all yell, "It's for homework".
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  It's homework, yet they're emailing instant messaging, you know, while -- 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- while they're doing their homework. 
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Yeah, but as -- as a whole, ah, I think that they have, um, contributed a great deal of positive things to education.
R:  Yeah.  Me too.
L:  So -- 
R:  So, let's see.  What else can we talk about computers and educ- -- well, does your classrooms have computers in them?
L:  Well, some of them do and, um, [MN] I -- I guess -- I have, um, [MN] -- I have a wide range of children.  Ah, it's like I started out -- well, I have a five year old that -- he's in daycare and they actually have a computer in their -- in their, um, daycare that they were able to use.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, so -- so, um, but they don't have all the -- you know, they don't have access -- the public schools that they don't have that access on a, um, one on one basis.  You know, they get to go to a computer lab and do certain activities but it's not like every student has a computer to work at in class [NOISE] or anything -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that.  Eventually -- 
R:  Well, does your -- 
L:  -- I -- ah, I think it'll get to that.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, I do too.  I do too.  I mean, I -- I -- I -- even, um, the teachers here will put their homework assignments are on the computer so if you aren't at school that day and you're sick --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can pull it up and see what you missed.
L:  Yeah, and that's -- [NOISE] that's really great.  We have that here.  We have a homework -- we -- and -- and we have the, um, [MN] the homework on the internet that you can -- you can also keep up with what your -- what your children are supposed to be doing.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which has really [NOISE] helped me to just make sure that they don't have missing homework [LAUGH] and -- and because, you know, I've had that problem before where they're like, "Oh, I forgot I had to do that".  But, now and I can go and say, "Okay.  Don't you have this to do?"  And that's not a problem.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And so -- 
R:  And grades --
L:  -- I'm -- I'm -- 
R:  -- and -- I -- everything's computerized.  I mean -- 
L:  [NOISE] --  
R:  -- when she has to take -- my daughter has to take her SAT exams you can sign up on the computer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for -- for the colleges, for the applications, for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything to do with schools anymore.
L:  Oh, right.  Even -- I was helping my son just today with his financial aid application.  You can do that on line also.  So -- 
R:  Oh, see?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  But, everything is just -- well, I'm -- I'm actually in their computer -- I do computer -- software development so -- 
R:  Oh, well then. 
L:  I'm a real advocate for [LAUGH] it anyway.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, there you go.  See, there, we have no negatives on computers and [LAUGH] education --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- on this conversation. 
L:  No.  I -- I just -- I -- I'm sure some -- someone actually does think that there's some negative things.  I know when we -- they first thought it using calculators in, um, schools. 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] right -- 
L:  They said that we weren't going to learn how to add or subtract because we had calculators.  But, I think if you learn the basics first then those things just compliment what you know.
R:  Well, that's right and don't you remember our typing class and how few people -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- knew how to type and now every kid, male and female -- 
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- types up a storm.
L:  Right.  That's true because in -- in our day -- well, in my day it was like [MN] only the girls were in typing class -- 
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] Like it's -- that's right.
L:  -- which shows they were going to be secretaries.  So -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- I do think it's a positive all around, you know, where it said education.  [NOISE] It, ah, you know, if it's used properly.  You know, in our schools they have [NOISE] blocks on, you know, the websites [NOISE] that they're not supposed to go to and -- 
R:  Yeah.  I -- 
L:  So [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- they -- ah, they have to -- I mean, that's almost a given.  That's -- which is sad --
L:  Yeah, but I -- 
R:  -- but they have -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have to do it.
L:  That is the only thing that there's -- that really bothers -- bothers me about computers is that [NOISE] people will take it to use it for something like that.  You know, it's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know everybody has their own preferences for what they like but I just don't think that that should be something that we should have to be worried about our children being exposed to.
R:  Right.  Right, and that's wrong.  Ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that -- we should be able --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- to control that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know they -- well they do.  We have to sign an agreement --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- when they use their computer at the school. 
L:  Yes.  Yes.  [several inaudible words] 
R:  That your child will use it correctly and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that you're willing to --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- let him use the computer at the school.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  So, before they even start with them you have to sign something.
L:  Yeah.  We actually had, um -- well, I remember at home we had --
