R:  Yeah, I've been in Spain.  A beautiful country.  Barcelona.  I've trav- traveled with the military's what I did for about fifteen years.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've never been -- well, I've been outside the United States just one time and that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- was to go to a little island called St. Martins.
R:  St. Martins?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've heard of that.  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's -- it's nice.  It's different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But other than that, I've never been outside the United States.
R:  Oh, well I've -- uh, you're lucked out 'cause, uh, I got [LAUGH] I'm veteran.  Fifteen years a veteran so I've been Vietnam for, uh, for two tours.  I've been in Vietnam and I've been in, uh, in Desert Storm too so ...
L:  Wow.
R:  I know.  I've been, uh, Iraq and all that. 
L:  Wow.
R:  It's all desert.  Iraq's all desert.  Just like they show ya.  It's -- it is.  It's all desert.
L:  So, do you think what they're doing over there is necessary?
R:  Yes.  Yes, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, I -- I back 'em all the way.
L:  You know --
R:  It -- first thing, it should be done be- it should of -- they should have done it before.
L:  Yeah, ten years ago, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Twelve years ago.
R:  When, uh, his dad was -- his dad was in there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But they -- Powell had a different thing and -- and, uh, he withdraw -- he withdrawed them and they could have walked right in there and -- and did the whole thing.
L:  Hm.
R:  Afghanistan, the same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They should have -- they should have done the same thing with Afghanistan.
L:  Well, don't you think --
R:  But the -- now -- now that somebody's taken control, now everybody wants to get in on the action now.
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  But, uh --
R:  And as far as --
L:  That country, uh, uh, North Korea I think.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's that the one with --
R:  Yeah, North Korea.  That's -- that's gonna be another -- that's a sticky situation right there.
L:  Isn't that situation somewhat worse because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that guy -- you know, he's like second generation nuts.
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean I -- I do back 'em whatever they -- you know, whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they do 'cause, um, so many people from here are out there.
R:  Believe me, they all got nukes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They do.  I tell ya, they -- they might -- they're not around but I'll tell ya they have a lot -- big majority of the stuff is buried.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They've got a lot of stuff buried and they can't find them.  They don't --
L:  Well --
R:  -- no, they have things that they can't track -- trace 'em.
L:  Yeah.  We were -- well, what we were concerned about when they first went out there is that since they couldn't find it because they were somewhere aimed right at the troops.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, we're glad to know that that's not true.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know, we were really worried, you know, so many kids are -- are out there.
R:  But I tell you right now, you go overseas I tell ya countries hate us because we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- stand for freedom.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, yeah.  Freedom and liberty.  That's what we stand for and, uh, and other countries don't like that.
L:  Well, you know --
R:  Because they've got a lot of -- [several inaudible words] got dictators.
L:  Yeah, and the mis- the whole concept of misery loving company.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then with freedom, a lot of times people look at Americans as arrogant.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'm in Los Angeles so --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's like eighty -- eighty five percent foreigners [LAUGH].
R:  Yep.  Well, I'm on the east coast so I'm in -- I'm in New York state so I'm on -- New York state.  In fact we just -- this is where -- probably three and a half miles is where that, uh, the terrorists hit, uh, our towers up there.
L:  Oh, three and a half miles.
R:  I'm only three and a half -- I'm only three and a half hours away --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- from where the towers were hit.
L:  Yeah, that was terrible.
R:  Oh.  I tell you I think I cried so much in my life [LAUGH] I tell ya.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, [several inaudible words] people did too.
R:  And I -- I helped -- I was with a fire company but we had -- we didn't -- a bunch of us didn't go.  There was some that went up to New York City.  Some of --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- the firefighters went up to help out but, uh, I wasn't one of them.
L:  Well, a guy from our church just happened to be out there when it happened and he was out there on business and he was supposed to be having a meeting at the -- at the towers --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and something happened just like so many people who weren't there at the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know something happened and he was delayed and he was delayed just long enough that he survived.
R:  Oh, gee.  Thank God.
L:  Yeah, and uh -- yeah, yeah.  And I mean, it's -- it's been a powerful testimony --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, because he got to see a lot of people pulled out of the rubble.  He was there, you know, and um, it was terrible --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it affected a lot of people here very deeply.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I tell you --
L:  A lot of flight attendants from here -- were from here.
R:  Oh I know it.
L:  You know.  They were making their return flights home.
R:  They were.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  Lots of people from Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember --
L:  You know.
R:  -- them saying some -- a lot of them from -- from the, uh, LA area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, it really affected folk so ...
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  You know.
R:  -- affected the whole -- right across the United States.  It -- it --
L:  It really affected the world.
R:  -- went right acr- it went right across the, you know --
L:  You know that was the thing that separated us from everybody else is that, you know, in Israel they live like that all the time.
R:  Oh, I know it.
L:  They live in fear all the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that was the thing that separated us from everybody else that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the United States would go in and police the world but they never had any trouble here at home.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not like that, and that made us just like everybody else is.
R:  Just like they --
L:  It took the sail off.
R:  That bin Laden.  They -- I don't know -- I don't know what the story is.  I -- as far as I'm concerned they should have had him a long time ago.
L:  Well, yeah.  Yeah, that is very true --
R:  But I guess --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- he gets 'em in them caves or get the -- I know them caves and they get them caves and them caves are like, um, uh, inside them caves --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they're just like, uh, a hotel room, you know.  They've got everything in there from sunrise -- you know, you've got everything in there.  You know, they're --
L:  So, you'd need sort of --
R:  -- built just like a house.
L:  Wow.
R:  They're just like a house.  Just like a house.  You can live in them things there for years and years.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And those guys must be down in there because do you think they got the other guy?
R:  I don't know.  I -- I -- my suspicion's probably not because I tell ya, I was in Desert Storm before and he's a sneaky little devil --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- Hussein and I tell ya he can -- he can escape, you know -- he can escape big time.
L:  Yeah.  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  But I don't know if they'll -- if they'll catch up with him or not.  I have no idea.
L:  Well, my cousin -- right now my first cousin is on the -- on the border of North Korea.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was stationed and they sent him out there the same time they started sending, uh, kids out there to this latest war in Iraq so --
R:  I had my -- my little nephew was the first one to shoot the -- from the submarines over there --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- uh, missiles off the submarines there when the Afghanistan broke out.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, he was the one that launched the missiles off.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  He was under -- he was in the subs.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  Now he's off -- I don't know where he's at now.  He was back in Norfolk[?] but [several inaudible words] coming in.  Now they've got a lot of them that just came back in from Norfolk.  A lot of ships just came back in.  Abraham Lincoln and all them.  They all came back in.
L:  Yeah.  Wow.
R:  Well, I tell ya that -- that, uh, that's a sign of relief right there when they all come back, you know.
L:  Yeah [NOISE].  True.  There's so many people here that are waiting, you know.
R:  Oh, you know, well, you know.
L:  -- for their kids to come home.  You know.
R:  yeah.  They're just waiting to have an answer --
L:  [several inaudible words] situation.
R:  -- from one of 'em.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah [NOISE].  My kids are little.  They're eight and twelve and I would just -- it's just a frightening thought.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a just frightening thought, you know, but yeah we just -- we just been praying a lot that all the kids will come back okay.
R:  Oh, that's it.  That's what they do.  They need lots of prayer.
L:  Yeah, you know, there's a lot of Christians that live in Iraq.
R:  Oh, you mean a lot -- yeah.  Oh, yeah.
L:  They -- they been oppressed for many years.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, and so we -- we've been praying for them too that they would be able to, you know, finally just live their lives, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and not live under a dictatorship but it was funny though when they were showing all the looting that was going on.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  People walking around with golden faucets and stuff.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  It's like, "What do you with it?"  "Nothing, I just want it" [LAUGH] you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Looting was a big thing.
L:  Yeah [NOISE]
R:  When everything goes in like that, everything -- everything's getting looted.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  
R:  Yeah, it happ-- well, the same thing happened up in New York City.  The same thing happened up there too.
L:  Really?
R:  They -- oh yeah.  They were looting up there big time.
L:  Really?
R:  That's why they called the national guard in to try to stop it all.
L:  Oh.
R:  They called the national guard and the military in to try to stop all that looting that gonna happen and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Boy.
R:  Bad.  You know, it's down the bottom of basements, they found gold bars, money -- there's all kinds of money down the bottom of that thing.  They got a -- they had to put security on that pretty fast.
L:  Yeah, you know that's a shame.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Those people were living in such poverty and this guy's sitting on all the money.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, and I -- I suspect that the situation in Korea isn't much different.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I tell you all that's Koreans, you know, they -- I -- I hate to say it.  I -- I still think they got nukes too.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I know they got nukes.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That -- that one guy.
R:  But they don't know which way they want to go.  They -- you know --
L:  Yeah.  They're gonna have to, um, you know, draw some kind of line in the sand with that guy.
R:  In fact they'd probably go with the Chinese and -- before they do anything and Chinese and, uh, Japanese before they probably do anything.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, this guy's like a real big fish, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I notice everybody's handling him with kid gloves and he seems a lot worse ...
