L:  Yeah.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  B- -- 
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  I'm Alexa- --
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, Mike.  How are you doing?
R:  Good, Mike.  I'm Wesley.
L:  Er.  Right.  Topic of the day, let's see, um, do we feel a threat by other countries?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if so, why?  Yeah.  I agree.  Iran --
R:  Iran?
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Iran?
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Tell me why.
L:  Iraq.  Well, I don't know.  Ah not so much the country themselves as I am [SIGH] so much for um the Taliban and that situation.
R:  Mhm.
L:  More so than the country itself I think.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm more worried about the terrorists.
R:  Yeah, their -- the Taliban's kind of spread around b- -- in various countries, aren't they?
L:  Yeah.  Actually, they are --
R:  So, it makes it --
L:  -- and that --
R:  -- it makes it a little hard sometimes to -- to um, I think, t- -- at least from where I stand to ah decide ah what country we're for or against --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- because there's so many good people there too.
L:  That's true and a lot of them didn't -- you know, they don't deserve to have that in their area, I guess, because it makes us just not like them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because of it.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.  I think that ah for me one country that comes to mind is North Korea because e- -- seem to want --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to have their nuclear wars -- warheads and --
L:  Agreed.
R:  -- um --
L:  I think they're big babies --
R:  You do?
L:  -- and they just do it for the attention.
R:  Well, I think that they're definitely trying to send a message, that's for sure.  I'm ah -- I don't know what the message is, but I think that they um [NOISE] [LAUGH] they want something.
L:  Why -- what, I'm not sure though.  Um, probably more handouts is the only thing I can consider, I mean, you notice they started up right about the time we started getting upset about Iraq?
R:  Well, that's 'cause we were vulnerable, I think.
L:  Or they thought we were.
R:  Yeah.  We -- we were -- our attention was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- elsewhere --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I think that um -- I think that one of the things they want more of is South Korea, you know, maybe they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- aren't happy with the way the Korean war ended and are looking --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- for more of South Korea.
L:  That's a strong possibility.
R:  And ah -- and if that's the case, then [LIPSMACK] it looks like there'd probably be another war again and I would imagine that US would be a part of it, but --
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  -- if they've got nuclear --
L:  Yeah with Bush being in there, I think we'd definitely be -- 'cause he's for military, for sure.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I know we need the protection.
R:  Yeah.  And they've got nuclear capability, so that's --
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  That's not a good thing for any country.
L:  No, not even ourselves.
R:  I agree.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Although the majority of people, I think, would say, "Oh, well, we're okay.  It's okay if we have it, because we're responsible" but --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, we're not --
L:  We're not.
R:  -- I don't think we're as responsible as a lot of people --
L:  I mean, like they think we are.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I agree with that, really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think it should be in anybody's hands because oh -- it take -- because those people that are representing us and [COUGH] there's times when they do things that we don't agree with.
R:  Sure.
L:  And they still continue to do what it is they feel is right.  And to have nuclear bombs I would really feel would not be -- somebody up in -- ah, way up there could be saying, yeah, we need -- we need to do this and everybody out here's saying "No", you know, because we're the ones who are going to suffer for it.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] I remember back in the eighties I um -- when I was in high school I was thinking of um different -- different artists, James Taylor and um -- he's the only one that comes to mind -- and they were against nuclear proliferation --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I thought, "Oh, my gosh.  I just love their songs, but if they would only get onboard because, you know, we have to have these nuclear weapons" -- this is when I was a teenager, thinking that we had to have these nuclear weapons to feel safe.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And if we could be safe, then we could protect the world.  And -- and that's just not true.
L:  No.
R:  But um [NOISE] --
L:  True.
R:  -- but there are definitely power hungry people out there who -- who want them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to dominate and um --
L:  I agree with that.
R:  -- it's a little scary that North Korea might be one of those countries.
L:  I mean, that's true.  That's true.  They -- they definitely -- well, like I said, I know they're -- they're definitely attention getters and um I'm sure they're going to try to do it again [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, when they think we're probably vulnerable again, at another point.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we're not -- we're really not vulnerable except for from the individual terrorists who come over here and do things like fly airplanes into our buildings.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I don't -- I don't feel that any one country besides, well, you know, as you said, the nuclear weapons, but still, [SIGH] I think um that's something that our government unfortunately is going to have to deal with because of individuals who really can't do too much about it.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, that's -- I -- I -- I guess I agree with that too, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think it's important to get involved and to stay aware of what's involved, but I also think that there are a whole lot of details that the general public just can't be privy to --
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  That's true.  
R:  Like, why did they know to -- that Iraq was such a threat?  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  There -- there are things that weren't released to the public and you know, a lot of things shouldn't have been --
L:  For a good reason.
R:  -- released to the public.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  They had the --
L:  Because [inaudible] it'd make a -- a nationwide scare, it really would, I think.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And you're -- there is -- there -- you're right, I agree that there's a lot of stuff they keep under wraps because they don't want a ah a panic from all of us --
R:  Sure.
L:  But what -- what -- where are we going to go?  Canada, Mexico?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can't hide.
R:  No.  And even if we could, you know, I think that that would be the wrong thing to do.  It would be, you know, I'm -- I'm a mother to small children --
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  -- if a threat was imminent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'd want to hide.  I'd want to hide them.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Not myself, but for them.  I agree with you.  I've got a two year old.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know exactly how you feel.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He comes first in everything I do.  Everything I -- any decisions, every day I make is based around him.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I -- I would like for him to be able to grow up in a safe place.
R:  And --
L:  It's bad enough we've got kids in school with guns and the drugs on the streets.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now we have to worry about other countries coming over here and suicide bombing us.
R:  Yeah, there's a lot to -- I guess there's a lot to be fearful of.  But maybe -- maybe within that, just like one of the positives of the nine eleven thing was increased patriotism.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, maybe we can -- maybe we can figure out the positives of this and instead of being fearful of other nations --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- we can try to be more understanding of them and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- hopefully work together.
L:  Yeah, well, if we can make lemonade out of the lemons that they gave us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Basically.  And our government is one who can control that, even if the rest of the population are [inaudible] one way, but we've seen that in the last election, did we not?  Al Gore should have literally won that election, but Bush instead overrides because he got the electrical -- the electoral votes instead the popular vote.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's how he got in office.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Nashville.
R:  What -- I'm -- 
L:  Tennessee.
R:  N- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.  I'm in um -- I'm in ah Milwaukee.
L:  Oh, cool.  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, that's an interesting point, too, I wonder what -- I wonder if the country as a whole would be any more or less fearful of any group or -- or other nation if we had a different president?
L:  Different president.  That's a good question.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know the answer to that.
L:  It really is.
R:  I'd have to think about that.
L:  I -- e- -- yeah.  Agreed.  You know, because I mean, I know we're -- all through history the republicans have always supported the military --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm not sure if all the wars that we have had, we've had republican --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah presidents or not --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I guess I probably -- that's probably something I should be taking more of a look at.
R:  Well, you and me both.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's a good question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.
L:  You know, 'cause um, I'd hate to think that every republican are the ones that have had war or all republicans are the ones that have always kept peace have been democrats.  I'd hate to find that out because it -- I think it would really shatter my look on the different parties, for sure.
R:  Same here.
L:  That are running our country.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you said, Iran.  That -- that that was um that kind of topped your list, Iran and then Iraq --
L:  [inaudible] Right --
R:  -- and ah --
L:  -- with the Taliban, yeah.  Because of Osama Bin Laden --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- basically.
R:  Yeah.  And so then, Afghanistan -- and I don't know if we have anything to fear from Afghanistan itself -- it's -- it's certainly got it's ah leadership problems and just like Iraq does now --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- and um ah I think that I -- I guess um my opinion is that no, we don't really have anything to fear from particular countries, but just individuals and --
L:  Individual group [inaudible].
R:  -- there are a lot -- there are a lot of individuals who are um [NOISE] not so nice in that part of the world, just like they're not so nice in our part of the world, too.
L:  Yeah, you're right.  The -- you -- you -- you get the same people everywhere you go, the only thing that's different is the faces have changed and so have the names.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  That's true.
L:  You know, and --
R:  Fifty years ago it was Germany.
L:  E- -- g- -- right.  That's right.  And ah --
R:  A- -- and that -- and that was a place to be feared and now I think that was a --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- nation to be feared.
L:  Ah -- you know, I think what happened -- if he would have had computers, back then, when he did that, he would have dominated the world.  Because he was so precise in everything that he did --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he had overtaken so many countries --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and killed so many Jews that I know that if he would have had computers and had --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more accurate control of things, like they do today --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he would have dominated the entire area over there and we would have lost that.
R:  Well, that's a good point.  Um, I think you -- I think you might be right.  Because he invaded so many countries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- including Russia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean and you know, we always thought that -- I
