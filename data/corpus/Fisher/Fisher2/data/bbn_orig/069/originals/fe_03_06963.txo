R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Dorothy.
L:  I'm Johnny.  How are ya?
R:  Oh, fine, fine.  I'm in, uh, Mississippi.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Phoenix at a hundred and six degree temperature. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness, oh.
L:  It's a little warm. [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't realize that.  My daughter lives in, um, [inaudible] Park, California, and my grandson wrote me and said it was ninety degrees there so ...
L:  Yeah, oh, it's -- it's hot.  What's your temperature up there?
R:  Yeah.  It's about -- it -- it -- really it's been fairly mild so far this season but, I don't know, my outdoor thermometer says eighty degrees but I don't -- I don't even think it's that warm out there but --
L:  Yeah, well, it's --
R:  -- it's probably been in the sun.
L:  It's hot here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, our topic is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, computers and education, was that it?
L:  Right, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I'm all for it.  I think it's a --
L:  I am, too.
R:  -- wonderful venue for almost anything you want to know.
L:  Absolutely.  I know I've gotten a lot more educated since I've had a computer.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  I mean, things that you're just able to look up.  Uh, I look up a lot of things, oh, medical and -- and, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things like that, and insurance and --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- different things and, I mean, I have gotten some -- some good ideas plus, uh, uh, looking on to see, uh, you know, the quality of the products that are out there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if things are scams or if they're good and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- check your prices out and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I use it a lot.
R:  Yeah, I think it's just -- I -- I -- I think it's an amazing tool [LAUGH]. I just can't believe --
L:  I do, too.
R:  -- that, you know -- that almost anything you want to know is -- is on that computer if you just, uh, you know, can figure out how to get to it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- pretty much I've -- I've never had too much of a problem.  I'm sure I don't do it, you know, in a -- in a standardized way but --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  -- eventually I get the information I'm looking for.
L:  Well, me too, me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I have found that you really can go in and pretty much just put a word of what you want in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been looking up a lot like, uh, uh, medicines and, you know, uh, how they react with other medicines --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and what they think about them, you know, and things like this --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- because there's so much stuff on the market today that, you know, you don't know -- I mean, they tell you, take this and it's wonderful for you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then a month later they tell you, "Oh, don't take that", you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Kind of -- [LAUGH]
R:  I just heard, uh, recently, a friend told me that she had read it I believe, um, and I'm not sure where but that, um, the hormone replacement therapy causes alzheimers.
L:  HGH, yes.
R:  Have you heard that?
L:  Yes.  Matter of fact, somebody called me about that the other day and, uh, so I thought well I'm going to look it up and see, I had told the fella, I said, "Well, I'm not interested right now" and I said, "Let me look it up and see", and they said that it can cause problems, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, for goodness sake.  You know, I have a sister who has alzheimers and she's in the end stages and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she took, uh, hormones for --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- years.  I think she had a hysterectomy after her last child.  She's in her -- let's see, I'm sixty six, so she is seventy four --
L:  Uh-uh. [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, you know, so she -- she took 'em all those years and I -- I just -- I -- I thought it was so strange because both my parents were so alert and oriented to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, eighty nine and ninety six.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I thought how -- you know, where did this come from and, of course, you start looking at yourself, too, and, you know ...
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  Well, I know, I'm -- I'm in the same -- I'm sixty seven and, uh, I know this but I feel -- I had never taken it.  I had, um, a hysterectomy back in seventy and, uh, I was never on any hormones or anything like that at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My daughter's on it and, uh, she was having such problems -- she's going through the change -- and she was having such problems and she stopped taking it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which she should have weaned -- been weaned off of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but she just stopped dead taking it and, uh, god, she wound up in the hospital, her blood pressure went up so high and --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- she had all kind of side effects from it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they put her back on it and they said, "Now, it's going to take about nine weeks to wean you off of this --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- little by little".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because if you stop dead it's just like stopping your blood pressure medicine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there's a lot of side effects on it, you know.
R:  Gosh.
L:  Yeah.  I don't --
R:  Well, back -- back to the computer though, have you ever -- have you taken any courses and classes in computers --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- and there's this --
L:  -- I did a couple of years ago and actually, uh, just basically how to get on and how to -- how to do that kind of stuff, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah, well -- yeah.
L:  And that was all but most of what I've learned is just from playing around with it, to be honest with you.
R:  Yeah, me, too, and I -- I'm getting -- I'm getting to the point where I think I'd like to go and -- and take, uh, some more lessons but now -- now that I think about it maybe I could even, um, find something on the internet to --
L:  You can.
R:  -- you know. [LAUGH]
L:  You can.
R:  Home school. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they do have lessons on the internet.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I bet I could.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I, uh, uh -- I had went and taken a class and then, uh, I found out that they did have, uh, lessons online --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, oh, I, uh, learned some things on there, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And as I say, then, um, my son had never used a computer either so that when I got it we were both kinda learning so things he learned he tells me and things I've learned [LAUGH] I told him.
R:  Yeah, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  And we're -- we're getting pretty wise, you know.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  But, uh, I'm -- I'm getting -- getting a lot better at it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, I mean, I -- I do, uh -- do some work on it and things like that, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I -- I enjoy.
R:  Are you employed?
L:  No, I'm retired.
R:  Yeah, yeah, me, too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I, you know -- I think you can find, um, you know, little -- little, um, part time jobs on there as well if you're --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  If you're interested.
L:  I -- I -- I, uh, know that there's a -- oh, what the heck is the website on there?  Uh, you can look for, uh, jobs online.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh god, I can't remember it right now but I looked , uh, uh, on there, too.  You can go in under employment and pull things up --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and that will tell ya things to do on there too, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I --
L:  I think it's great for kids.  Uh, I -- I've said that if, uh, they would have had those years ago I'd have been much better in history than I am.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll tell you because --
R:  Sure.
L:  I mean, it's interesting when you look it up and you read it on there, you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- see the things that -- on there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, uh, I think it's really improved and as long as you monitor your children --
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.
L:  -- what they're -- what they're watching --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think a computer's a great thing.
R:  Yeah.  For a couple of years I took care of my three young grandchildren and they were, like, uh, let me see, two, three and four, and I was amazed.  Uh, I got a computer, uh, right when I first started, uh, keeping them and I was just amazed at how quickly --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that little two year old --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm telling you, he was so funny, he could hardly get his little hand on the mouse, you know, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  His little hand was so small and -- and they just -- oh, it was amazing the things they learned and -- and --
L:  Yeah, I know, my children are -- are -- well, my grandchildren, great grandchildren, uh, actually, they, uh, all are on the computer and children are so much smarter today --
R:  Absolutely.
L:  -- than they were back then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that this is much better for them than, uh, uh, calculators, I'll tell you that much.
R:  Oh yeah, I think so, too.
L:  Calculators make 'em lazy.
R:  Yeah, sure does, yeah.
L:  I mean, they don't --
R:  And you know I see adults now, young -- young adults, now, in -- in the workplace, they can't add two and two.
L:  Oh, I know it.  I know, if you go in and give them, uh, twenty dollars and sixty seven cents --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and something is -- is twenty one seventy -- they're -- nineteen seventy -- they can't figure out --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- what you're supposed to get back in change, you know.
R:  No, no.
L:  No --
R:  It's -- it's amazing.  We did them a disservice, that generation, and I don't know that this one's any better but --
L:  Yeah, I know, I don't think calculators are the best thing in the world for 'em.
R:  I don't either but I -- I sure do --
L:  But you know what, I found on -- online that I really enjoy, there was a site and it's a game actually, but it's the states and it'll tell you, uh, you know, where is, uh, uh, Philadelphia, you know, where the capital of -- what's the capital of New York City --
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  -- or things like that and I enjoyed playing it 'cause I used to be really good in that years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I was in school --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and didn't realize how much I forgot, you know.
R:  Yeah, sure.
L:  And it was -- it was, uh, a lot of fun just playing it by yourself and learning, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then they'd have a -- uh, they'd give you the capital and then you had to put it in the state that it belonged in, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, I -- I really enjoyed that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then the same they had, like, with countries, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Course so many of the countries have changed their names --
R:  Yeah, they have.
L:  -- since we were in school [LAUGH].
R:  You're right.
L:  You know.
R:  Uh-huh, they sure have.
L:  Yeah, and they've split and there's two or three countries which one -- once was one, you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, it's -- it's amazing and I -- I, um -- I -- I wonder sometimes, uh, you know, I -- like I said, I'm retired too and -- and have some time on my hands and I think [LAUGH] you know, thank goodness for this computer -- [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  -- because it's certainly a form of entertainment as well as, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, knowledge.
L:  Yeah, I, uh, have a solitaire game I play.  That's the only game I play on there --
R:  Oh gosh, I play --
L:  -- but I have that that I like --
R:  I get to play bridge which it's really hard to find --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- three other people that -- that -- you know, that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, know how to play bridge or -- or -- and most --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Most people don't want to learn if they don't know how.
L:  Yeah, I never learned --
R:  But --
L:  -- how to play bridge --
R:  Oh, it's a wonderful game.
L:  -- but --
R:  I love it.
L:  -- I like solitaire and they -- they've got one game which is a -- supposed to be a real hard one on there and I'm one of these people that, uh, "You're not going to get the best of me", [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH]
L:  -- if it kills me --
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  -- and, I mean, I'll get myself a play where I can't sleep and I'll go in and I'll say --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "I'm not going to bed until I win three games" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- on this thing and I'll play it and I'll play it and I'll play it --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  -- until I win this --
R:  Yeah --
L:  Get three games in.
R:  -- three in a row, huh. [LAUGH]
L:  I know I gotta get three in --
