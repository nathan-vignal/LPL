L:  Education.  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Melanie.
R:  Hi, Melanie.  This is Ingrid.
L:  Hi, Ingrid.
R:  Where --
L:  Nice to meet you. [LAUGH]
R:  Likewise.  Where are you?
L:  I'm pr- -- what?
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Utah.
R:  In Utah!  Wow.
L:  Yeah, where are you?
R:  I'm in Florida.
L:  Well, very nice.
R:  Hot and humid. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  And it's just -- last week was hot, hot, hot here --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it's beautiful this week so ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And no humidity --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- so ...
R:  -- no fair.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, um, computers in education.  Well, um [NOISE] I think computers are a useful tool in education but at the same time I think that our society has, um, kind of put too much emphasis on them --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and has gotten away from the -- from the basics.
L:  You know what?  I agree completely.  I think [NOISE] that there's a place for 'em --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I feel like lots of times computers are --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- replacing personal interactions --
R:  I agree a hundred percent.
L:  -- and -- and that just really is very damaging and -- and I think that because of that we're seeing lots more people feeling --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Having feelings of isolation and -- because, you know, they're just sat in front of their computer and this is what you're supposed to do and you don't ever get to visit with anyone or interact so ...
R:  Right, email is taking the place of, um, written letters --
L:  Right.
R:  -- written word and, um, I think that, um -- that the school systems are placing more emphasis on computers than they are on, like, musical education.
L:  Exactly.  I was just going to say the arts.
R:  The arts.  The arts, exactly. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, yep, I agree.
R:  And, um, especially, um, the public school systems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I think that [MN] -- I'm not against public education because I went to a public school but I think that if possible that a -- that, you know, if you can get your child to a private school where they are, you know [NOISE] -- you know exactly what they're going to teach and perhaps you can have a say so in it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I think that's -- that's true.  I [NOISE] -- my kids go to a public school here.  I think a -- a lot of it probably depends on where you live because --
R:  I -- I think you're right.
L:  -- certainly there are places that I would be terrified to send my children to a public school but, um, the school systems here are really good, um --
R:  Whereas here, they're -- you know, they're not.  That was, um -- we just moved back to Missouri or back to Florida from Missouri, from Saint Louis --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we had a great school system there, great public schools --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and here I just don't have the confidence in the public school system.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Um, [NOISE] we have magnet schools -- I'm sorry, just one moment.  You have a good night, I'll be right there.  Um, we have magnet schools where the children can, um -- where you can decide, like in junior high school they can start going to like a computer, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- where the emphasis is on computers or like on medicine, like if the child thinks that they're interested in medical school --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, you know, I think that that's a really good program but -- but as far as computers I think that they're -- you know, they were going to learn it sooner or later --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and unless the children are planning on going into programing that, um -- you know, that that should come secondary to everything else.
L:  I agree, yep.  Um, they've got to learn how to [NOISE] -- they need to learn how to spell instead of just knowing how to run spell check, um --
R:  Right, exactly, and, I mean, it's like when we were in school we had to do the, um -- you know, the long math --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as opposed to using, um, like, the calculators --
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE] -- and -- and I have a third grader and I see now that she is learning how to do things with the, um [NOISE] -- you know, with the -- with the long math and such but I just worry about -- about the computers, you know --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  -- and are they going to take the place where they really don't know how to spell and they don't have to.
L:  Right.  I think that would -- that would be a dangerous and a -- and a tragic mistake --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for society to fall into [SIGH]. So, I think they're great, um, like we've mentioned they certainly have their place but -- but they need to not replace everything that has been taught or the way it's been taught.
R:  Yeah, that's exactly right.
L:  So, [LIPSMACK] uh --
R:  It's just, uh -- it's kinda scary [LAUGH] because everything -- like I think the good thing about, um, the internet is that anybody can say anything on the internet --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but the bad thing about the internet is anything -- anybody can say anything on the internet.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [NOISE]
R:  And I think that, um -- that there's a lot of dangerous information coming from the internet just because, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there's -- you know, there's no control and -- and --
L:  Right.
R:  And our children are being -- can be fed information.  My daughter's just started -- she's nine and she's in third grade, as I said, and she's just started to where she likes to go and get on, like, Disney --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm terrified --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because I'm afraid that she's going to be exposed to something that she's not, you know, mentally ready to handle.
L:  Right.  Yep, that's really scary.
R:  It's very scary and I know that they're using the internet in -- in the classrooms now because we had to sign a consent form.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Are they doing that there in Utah?
L:  Um, you know, I don't think so.  I've actually got a son going into seventh grade and as far as I know he's not been on the internet in class, um --
R:  Well, they said, um -- and my second grader -- I have a second grader, also -- and they also said that, um -- that they would be using the internet under teacher supervision and I wasn't as worried about him, I guess, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And I guess they are doing it supervised but still, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- you have to worry about the -- the type of, [NOISE] you know, things that -- that they are going to be [LAUGH] exposed to.
L:  Well, and I personally feel that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if they're using the internet at school it ought to be supervised regardless of their age.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, they're more likely to stumble across something that can be very harmful or damaging [LAUGH] at an older age.
R:  Oh yeah, that's true.
L:  I --
R:  I think that, yeah, it could be even, well, potentially damaging, like you said.  It -- you know, when they're in seventh grade.
L:  Right, because they do have a little more knowledge and just --
R:  A lot more knowledge [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, a lot more but just enough to -- that they could really get themselves in bad trouble --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whereas the second grader probably isn't going to be getting that far into it, I don't know.
R:  Right, yeah, no, I agree --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- wholeheartedly and I think that a lot of times that, um, the websites that they visit can be kind of deceiving.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they can ask for certain information and they may think that they're going to some -- one place and actually be led to another.
L:  Right, yeah, they --
R:  So, then, um, I've seen too many reports where, you know, the kids have given out information, you know, like in the chatrooms and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, with all of the -- with all of the stuff that's going on and the things that we're hearing about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the, you know, different cases and I -- I know that, you know, just like the Smart case was a -- a very --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] -- you know, an isolated case but I think that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it may happen more often than we think --
L:  Right, I think you're right. [NOISE]
R:  -- but --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- kinda -- it is very scary.
L:  It is. [NOISE]
R:  But, um, we [NOISE] -- every place I go somebody's yelling or screaming or barking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Shh.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  [NOISE] At least that's one thing about the computer, it doesn't talk back. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know, it can beep at ya. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes [LAUGH] It does -- does that.  Um --
L:  Um --
R:  I know that one of the programs here in Jacksonville --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, as I said, that we have the magnet schools --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- one that they do concentrate on is computers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I don't know if it's specifically like surfing the internet or -- or learning how to do computer programming or, um --
L:  Right.
R:  -- exactly what it is but I think that it would be a, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  A worthwhile thing to see, you know, what they -- you know or if it's for the communications --
L:  Right.
R:  -- part on it or --
L:  The networking or --
R:  [NOISE] -- the networking or --
L:  -- the actual building or -- yeah, um --
R:  [NOISE] Shh, I'm on the phone please. [NOISE]
L:  You can probably hear my kids, too, can't ya?
R:  Oh well, mine -- but mine don't know how to talk in a quiet voice.
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  They only know how to yell. [LAUGH]
L:  So in that magnetic -- magnet schools, if they go to it and decide, "Okay, this isn't what I'm after" can they go ahead and change or are they kind of there?
R:  I think that they do have the option of going back to a -- like, um, a non magnet public school but, um, they're very -- it's very competitive.
L:  Huh.
R:  I know that some of the schools only have, like, three openings --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and, you know, there may be five hundred children competing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But now those are for, um, you know, perhaps like the dance, they have a lot of, um, art and dance.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So in one, you know, respect that is good that they -- you know, that they do have the different -- the different options.  And we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know that we have a French immersion school and a Spanish immersion school.
