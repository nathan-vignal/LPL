R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  My name is Angie.
R:  Hi Angie.  My name is Jo.  How are you?
L:  I'm wonderful.  How are you Jo?
R:  Pretty good.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well great.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Ah, I'm calling from Missouri.
R:  Missouri.  I'm in Dayton, Ohio.
L:  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Well -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm in Missouri.  So, we're -- we're both similarly mid west, I guess, sort of.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How are you tonight?
R:  Well, I'm doing okay.  I just walked in the door when the phone [LAUGH] rang -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from work.  I had -- this is my late night so -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What time is it there?
R:  It's, um, twenty five after nine.
L:  Oh, my.  That is late.
R:  Yeah.  What time is it there?
L:  Twenty five after eight.  [LAUGH] --  
R:  Oh.  So, there's an hour difference.
L:  Yeah, that's not -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.  So -- 
L:  Well, I guess we're supposed to talk about computers in education.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- and how we feel can -- do we have -- feel that computers help or harm education.  Is that what -- is that what you heard? 
R:  That's what I heard.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So -- 
L:  Why don't you go first and -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and we can -- we can -- we can have a -- a running dialogue as we go.  I might -- 
R:  Okay.  Well, you know, I -- I guess [MN] -- when I went to school, of course, you know it was not the computer age and we didn't have it so that forced us to, you know, use the -- utilize libraries and you know, encyclopedias and things that have, you know, ah, are not being used that much anymore but [SIGH] I mean, if you're going to keep up my God you've -- you know, you're -- you're lost without one.
L:  Yes.  That's -- 
R:  You know?  And -- 
L:  -- very true.
R:  -- you're so behind and you're so able to [MN] -- I mean, the -- the wealth of information that you can obtain from one.  I mean, it's just -- it's unbelievable. 
L:  Yes.  That's -- 
R:  You know, so -- 
L:  -- very true.
R:  -- I just, you know, you -- you just -- you just have to have 'em this day in age I guess.
L:  Yes, I agree with you on that respect.  I think that, um -- I don't know that, um, [MN] [SIGH] I -- I wasn't raised with having computers either.  I -- I was, um -- they kind of came --
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- in.  I was on the tail end of it when I was in school and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- and, uh, they didn't even have keyboarding when I was in high school so I mean -- 
R:  Yeah, I know.  Us either.  We had the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- typewriter.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Right.  Yeah, we had -- we actually had electric typewriters -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which I'm really glad that I decided to take typing because of -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, as I got into college it was -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if I didn't have -- if I hadn't have taken, you know, keyboarding or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not keyboarding but typing, I would have -- 
R:  Typing.
L:  -- been terribly lost.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, you know, I think that computers are a neat tool for education but I wonder if they're just like a lot of other things that, you know, you can -- you can use them to the point where they -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, they become a crutch.
R:  Yep.
L:  And I think that you're right.  You know, if we don't teach our kids how to use them and how to benefit from the internet and how to benefit from, you know, the -- the speed that they can gain the information, I think we're probably doing our kids a disservice.  But, then again, I think that [MN] there are people that use them too much and they rely on, um --  
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you know, the -- the educational programs that -- that, ah, that they can -- you know, they've got things from -- everything from English to Maths to Spanish to all kinds of stuff that you can get on computers to teach kids.  Well, [SIGH] I don't know that that's the best way to teach them.
R:  Yeah.  I -- 
L:  You know, because they learn a lot about -- you know, if you have a dialogue with a teacher or a dialogue with, um -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- you know, students in a classroom, you're also learning other things about language and about how to address other people and how to have good conversations that you don't when you're just punching the keys in a keyboard.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  And so I -- 
R:  Um [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- think that there is a lot that you learn about people and about communication that you -- that you can't have when you inter- -- you don't interact with a computer.  You interact with people.
R:  I agree too.
L:  So -- 
R:  And there's just something too about, ah, researching and looking that up and -- and -- and [NOISE] you know, that you worked, you know, extra hard to [NOISE] obtain that information.  I don't know.  [NOISE] I just [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Well, I know that, um -- 
R:  [MN] [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- my husband is -- has been in the process of trying to find a job.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, ah -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- you can spend literally hours searching for information -- 
R:  Oh.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- and searching for the right information -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on computers and you know, when you get up you don't feel like you've gotten anything accomplished.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I don't wonder if maybe kids feel that way sometimes too. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's -- I remember going to that -- you know, that great big book -- um, not book, the great big catalogue.  The card catalogue.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you know, looking for a topic -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, or looking for an author and then -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- maybe finding two or three books and -- and being able to narrow down a search for -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- information fairly quickly.  But, I wonder if there's just such -- such an overwhelming, um, [MN] you know, infor- -- um, just so much information because you have access to, you know, stuff from other countries and other languages -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- when you're -- yeah, that's -- 
R:  Different -- 
L:  -- [inaudible] 
R:  -- [inaudible] and just -- I mean, oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It -- it's -- 
L:  And I wonder if it's not overwhelming, if it's just too much [LAUGH] sometimes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] -- 
R:  It's unbelievable.
L:  Yeah.  You know, you can -- there's just so many things that are at your fingertips that it's just -- 
R:  Yeah. The click of a -- the button.  The mouse.
L:  Right.  So, ah, computers in -- in education, I think they probably have a place.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, most definitely.  You know, and if you don't own one and you don't have one then you're -- you're -- it's, you know, you're lost.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  You know, you are.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, my mother had email and then she got frustrated.  She took a class in computers and -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she, ah, [MN] ah, something -- as soon as she -- she started to get to understand what was going on with Windows and things like that -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, her computer -- I don't know if it got a virus or something -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- happened and [LAUGH] she -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- her computer went down and she has never -- she had somebody fix it but she's never gotten back on line and -- 
R:  Never got back on.
L:  -- [LAUGH] I don't -- I don't know if it demoralized her or what when wrong. 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I know.
L:  I miss being --
R:  It's like -- 
L:  -- not being able to communicate with somebody because -- 
R:  Talk.  Yeah.
L:  -- email is so easy for me.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  It is -- 
L:  And -- and, ah -- 
R:  You can just email a card, a greeting a -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- this, a that.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Very much so, yeah.
R:  You know?  And nobody knows, ah, how to write a letter, you know -- 
L:  Oh, my goodness.  My handwriting is awful anymore.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- a handwritten -- yeah.  A handwritten letter, you know?  I'm like, "Oh, goodness".  You know, they send you a thank you and I'm like, "I'm sorry, I am old fashioned and I'm not that old and I want to thank you [inaudible]".  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I do too.
R:  You know, there's just -- 
L:  I do too.
R:  You know?
L:  You know it means something when you get a letter in the mail.
R:  It -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] thank you.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  And so -- 
L:  You do.
R:  -- you know, those are the things I guess I miss --  
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the most.  You know, and -- and with technology, ah, you know, something -- you -- you know, you lose some things.  So, ah -- 
L:  Yeah, the personal communication and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- 
R:  And the interaction.
L:  -- agree with you a lot on that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's -- there's a lot too be -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- said for that personal touch.
R:  Yep.  Yep, but -- 
L:  [several inaudible words] you can't get it.
R:  -- you know, unfortunately if -- if you're [NOISE] going to be in the mainstream you've got to have one [NOISE] --  
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know?
L:  This is true -- 
R:  You'll be lost.
L:  [LAUGH] You are right.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  You know?  [LAUGH] You'll be the outcast.  Like, "You don't have a computer?"  I'm like, "No, I don't have caller ID either".  There's a lot of things I don't have.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I don't -- I don't like caller ID.
R:  You know, h- h- -- it's just -- you know, my poor father in law, he got caller ID -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause he was getting some bad phone calls.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I said, you know -- so, I called him the other day and he's like, "I almost didn't answer this call because I didn't recognize the number".  And I said, "Yes, and then you wouldn't have known you're great grandson was in hospital". 
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  You know, nothing major but, you know -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- a little bug but, you know, he -- just because of caller ID.  I'm like, "Oh, just throw it out the window".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It's just -- I don't know, this day in age it's different.
L:  It is very much.  Depersonalized and, ah, computerized and, ah, technolized[?], [LAUGH] and, ah, technologically, whatever, all that stuff.  Yeah --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Things happen very quickly.  They really do.  I was -- what were we doing?  We were, um, [MN] oh, well, we were watching a movie and I can't remember what the movie was but, ah -- oh, it was Joan of Arc.
R:  Oh.
L:  And we were watching.  And Joan went off and did all this stuff in -- in the capital of the country and everything and -- and went back home and her parents never knew anything about what she did.  And think about in this day in age, you know, with computers -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and with -- I mean, we know what's happening half way around the world and probably five minutes after it happened.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [MN] And, ah, so there's a lot that -- you know, and I'm sure that [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Well, yeah -- 
L:  -- that's good and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- but, you know, just with the war and things going on, I mean, you have the computer images, you know, just -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- instantly.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, and you knew everything -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- still -- you know, you still do, you know?  But -- 
L:  [MN] Yeah, and that's another thing, um, having, ah, having television with the news broadcast into, ah -- you know, into schools -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with the education and so I don't -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- I don't know that I -- that I really think that that's a good thing at all.  I -- I mean, I -- I understand current events is a good thing to be up on but, ah, you know, I think that there's a lot of images about, you know, with, ah, with the nine one, one and everything -- 
R:  [MN] Oh.
L:  -- that happened that -- 
R:  You know it.  You know it.
L:  -- I don't want to start -- I wouldn't want my kids to start their day out that way -- 
R:  No.
L:  -- you know, with all that -- 
R:  No.  A diet of -- 
L:  -- bombarding them.
R:  Yeah.  No, I agree.  I mean, it's one thing if you want to, you know, have [NOISE], you know, a portion of it and then discuss it with them. 
L:  Right.
R:  But, I mean, just to -- you know, I don't --
