L:  Hi.  My name's Phillip.
R:  Hi.  I'm Barbara.
L:  Hi, Barbara.  Ah, where are you?
R:  I'm in New York City.
L:  Ah, me too -- me too.
R:  You are?
L:  Ah, yes.
R:  Oh.
L:  On the upper west side.
R:  I just came from there.  I'm downtown.
L:  All right -- all right -- all right.  What do you think about the subject matter?
R:  Well, I'm in favor of education. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, all right -- all right -- all right -- all right.
R:  [LAUGH] No, I think we're supposed to talk about computers in education.
L:  Computers in education?  I thought initially it was, ah, just education. But then --
R:  Yeah.  But then, right before they connected -- I don't know it you heard that or not -- they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- said --
L:  Computers --
R:  -- computers in --
L:  -- in education.
R:  -- education.
L:  Well, do you want to go first?
R:  Um, okay.  Well, I'm in favor of that, because if they didn't have computers in education I couldn't call my niece and nephew every time I had a problem with my computer -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and ask 'em should do. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [inaudible] help.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] "I don't care if you are eight years old.  Tell me what to do".
L:  [LAUGH] Real- --
R:  But no, I -- I think, um, that's it's really a necessity.
L:  I -- you know, I -- I think computers obviously are great and everything.  But, I think unfortunately -- I remember that I -- ah, I saw this fellow -- his name's Clifford Stole. [MN]  He's very -- he was very much involved in the creating -- creation of the computers and everything.  And was saying -- he says, you know, "We -- people, ah, you know, ah, assume that just because you have a computer, you know, that's knowledge.  It depends upon what you're using it --"
R: Exactly.
L:  "-- for".  And unfortunately so many people are playing video games, you know, instant messaging, ah, you know, ah, like, shopping on it, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- pornography.  And, it's like, what you're doing with it --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- obviously that's what counts.  And I don't think people are doing any-- anything with computers than they are with, like say, television or reading.  It's like, you know, junk in, junk out.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, yeah.  I -- 'cause I am a big -- ah, I'm a big reader and everything.  And I -- I think that, you know, not enough people read and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- keep themselves well informed and everything.
R:  Well, I'll tell you the last project I was doing.  I went online and I typed the topic in Google, and I found thirty three thousand websites.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And hours later I was just on, like, two hundred.
L:  Right.
R:  And I just said, [MN] "Forget this".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I went to the library and got some books because it was just so overwhelming.
L:  Yeah, I -- I could -- yeah, I could imagine -- I could imagine.  But, I must say, ah, I think it's great.  Like, ah, you know, I, ah -- I, ah -- my computer died a couple of weeks ago.  But, I like -- I -- I -- I used to go on different websites, ah -- ah, different newspapers -- you know, the London Times --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Washington Post and everything.  And that I love doing.  Getting different perspectives.  Reading the BBC and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's what I enjoy about it.
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  And I also, ah, connect with friends a lot on the computer -- who live all around the world, which saves us an awful lot of money.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know, I -- I don't -- I don't like co- -- I don't like communicating with -- ah, on computer because, like, you know -- because I'm single and I've --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah, you know, tried to, you know, -- ah, you know, meet women this way.  You know, ah, different websites for dating and everything.  And women that -- are, like, reluctant to give the phone number.  It's like, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, I just don't communicate terribly well over the computer -- typing and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everything.  I -- I -- I -- I do much better in talking to a person or, you know -- ah, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- face to face.  But, yeah, I think something gets lost, you know, over the -- over the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- computer.
R:  It does.  I mean, eventually you -- I mean, these are friends that I already know.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  So, for us we -- you know, we have a voice attached to those words on the screen in --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- our heads, and a -- and a visual image.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's a little different.  And otherwise we couldn't communicate because of the cost of calling back and forth.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  So, that's an advantage --
L:  Right -- right.
R:  -- um, also with my family that doesn't live in New York.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, that's an advantage as well, although sometimes it gets to be a pain --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- 'cause I -- I'm doing work online --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, you know -- and I get, ah, you know, this instant message.  It's like people lurking.  And I'm, like, "I'm working".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  "I can't afford to --"
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, ah, it gets to be really annoying sometimes.
L:  Ah, you know, something?  I hate to say this but, you know, I used to -- I blocked my friends. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I had -- put them on my block list because it was -- like, I find it so annoying.  I don't like getting instant messages when I'm doing something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] Like, the just [inaudible] -- 'cause I was -- one day, ah, I remember I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing some work and my friend said, "Oh, hi.  How are you, Phillip?"  And, you know, it's like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- "Oh jeeze, I'm doing work here right now".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I just put them on my block list.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And 'cause I -- I don't like the instant messages.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind of work do you do?
L:  Actually right now I'm unemployed.  But, I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I used to be the infomercial industry.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  How about yourself?
R:  I'm a writer.
L:  All right -- all right -- all right.  What type of stuff do you write?
R:  I write plays.
L:  Oh -- oh -- oh.  Have you seen any good plays?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  Have you seen any good plays?
R:  Actually, this past week I saw one --
L:  Which one?
R:  -- really bad one, and I saw one almost good -- it was so close.
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  It was, ah, Our Lady Of A Hundred and Twenty First Street.
L:  I -- I -- I saw something about that.  What was that about?
R:  It was really good, but it didn't end, it stopped.
L:  Oh.
R:  Do you know what I mean?
L:  [MN]
R:  It was, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, "That's it?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know what I mean?  It didn't have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't feel like it came to an end.
L:  Right, uh-huh
R:  Even a non ending that's designed as ending --
L:  Right, uh-huh. 
R:  -- ah, finishes.
L:  [MN]
R:  It just -- you know, they -- they held their pose and the lights stayed up.  And I thought there was some mistake -- ah, somebody missed a cue or something, or -- and didn't turn the lights down.
L:  [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE] 
R:  And then they slowly came down.  And I went, "Ooh, somebody's gonna catch hell for that", you know. [LAUGH]  And then, when they came up again they were holding hands and taking a bow.  And I went, "Oh, that was the end of the play".
L:  You know, something similar happened to me.  Where was it?  Sar- -- what was it?  Ah, the college -- ah, it used to be a womens college on --
R:  Sarah Lawrence.
L:  Yeah, Sarah Lawrence, on the eastside.  This was around ten years ago.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I went -- it was supposed be, ah, a ballet performance -- a one person ballet performance.  And, ah, I went there.  It was supposed to be a Japanese performer.  And, ah, not many people turned out -- like, four or five people in the audience. [NOISE]  This guy came out on the -- on the stage and danced for, like, three or four minutes.  And when it was -- he just stopped in the middle of the performance, walked off stage and started screaming.
R:  [MN]
L:  And then, around five -- ten minutes later, ah, someone came out and said, "Ah, unfortunately he cannot go on with the performance, and we're terribly sorry".  And I've always wondered -- I said, "What happened?"
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  I just thought, ah, he -- he saw how -- how few people there were in the audience and he got very discouraged. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, but it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's not what you do.
L:  Yeah, I know -- I know.
R:  [MN]
L:  Ah, but do you go to plays very -- very often?
R:  Um, not as often as I used to 'cause --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'm too busy doing them, so --
L:  All right -- all right.
R:  -- which is -- which is good in a way.  But, I -- I miss a lot of good stuff.  And --
L:  [MN] It just so happens my ex -- I used to work with -- at Channel Thirteen.  And my ex girlfriend -- one of -- one aspect of her -- her jo- -- of her job was to go review, ah, different plays to possibly be considered, ah, for great performance.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was really a great gig because of the fact she got [MN] a right to bring a guest and dinner also.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  We used to go to the plays all the time.  And the producers would -- we were, like, you know, twenty three -- twenty four years old at --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the time.  All these producers were, like, "Oh, how'd you like the play?  Oh --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- would you like to go for drinks?" and everything.  And we --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- were very impressed.
R:  Yeah -- yeah, I know.  It's -- it's -- I mean, I -- it seems like every time I have a chance to go for free I'm in rehearsal, or --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- something --
L:  -- definitely.
R:  -- you know, so that's -- ah, I just haven't got to see -- I mean, for instance, before the Academy Awards -- I'm a -- a member of SAG, and I can get into see almost anything for --
L:  Sh- she was --
R:  -- free.
L:  -- a member of that too.  That was -- that was a --
R:  And I --
L:  -- great perk too.
R:  I saw one -- I saw Chicago, and then I was in rehearsal for something.  I couldn't go.  
L:  Oh.
R:  And I was, like -- so then, after the show closed I'm, like, "Oh, now I could go to the movies", and now I have to pay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Sorry. [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you see, ah, the John Malkovich movie?
R:  No, mm -- mm.
L:  Oh, do you like him?
R:  Not particularly.
L:  Oh, really?  Yeah, I -- I lo- -- I -- I think he's great.  Yeah, I think he's great.  I always liked him.
R:  Kind of menace to him that disturbs.
L:  Wait.  What?
R:  This kind of menace.
L:  [SIGH] Yo- you know --
R:  Menacing --
L:  -- something?
R:  -- underneath that disturbs me.
L:  You know something?  So -- a friend of mine said the same thing.  And I said, "Jeeze, I've always loved him".  I -- I -- very intense quality, which I've --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- always found fascinating.  Yeah.  No.  And it --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- was a good movie.  It was -- for his first attempt at directing it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was very good.  Yeah.  Definitely he -- definitely has a future in, ah, directing also.
R:  Mhm.  Well, he certainly has the background for it.
L:  Yeah -- yeah.  Do you ever go down to Angelica Theater?
R:  Sometimes, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I'm trying to see -- ah, see some theater now I have a little break.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, but it's -- so, I have passes, but I can only use them for I think two -- two plays.  And I'm, like, "Okay.  But, if I use them for Hairspray then suppose I decide -- suppose I don't like that and wish I had used it for The Producers. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, how you on- only have two.  I can -- and it's -- like, I'm taking forever to decide which two -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I wanna see.
L:  Did you ever see a movie, Ha- -- the movie, Hairspray?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, I like John Waters.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, he -- he's very off the -- yeah, I like him.
R:  And I was cut out of the movie The Producers.  I worked on it for a week.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah, when I was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a kid.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah, he shot two different endings.
L:  Oh.
R:  And he went obviously with the other one, and cut all the s- --
