L:  Hello?
R:  Hello, this is Raphael.
L:  Hi, Raphael, my name is Robyn.
R:  Hi, Robyn.
L:  Hey, how are you?
R:  [NOISE] I'm doing good.
L:  Are we --
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  From Atlanta.
R:  From Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  Yeah.  Where are you?
R:  Oh.  I'm in Provo, Utah.
L:  Oh, wow, this is really cool.
R:  This is pretty cool, isn't it?
L:  Oh, it's ah, what, eight o'clock out there [LAUGH].
R:  It's actually, what time is it, yeah it's eight ten.  What time is it over there?
L:  Yeah.  It's ten oh -- well, ten, ten here.  Ten oh four.
R:  Okay.  Not bad.  How did you hear about this program, this -- this study that the University's doing?
L:  Um, actually I am involved in ah refunding site ah -- ac- -- ah she's from Bolder, Colorado --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and ah her name is Michelle Easter and she has a website up that um she's been doing it for about twenty years and it was posted on this website, so ...
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Um, found out about it there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Ah, one of the guys -- I live in the foreign language housing of [inaudible] University --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and ah one of the guys from the Spanish house heard about it and told me, so here I am.
L:  Oh -- oh, that's neat.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you done this before?
R:  I done it -- I've done it once.
L:  Okay.  
R:  It was on pets.
L:  It was on what?
R:  On pets.
L:  Oh boy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What's ours again?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry?
R:  What's -- what's our topic?
L:  Education and computers.
R:  Education and computers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.  How sh- --
L:  So, I g- -- this is ah -- honestly, Raphael, this is my first time, so if you --
R:  Oh, it's your first time?
L:  Yeah.  But I thought it was really interesting because I'm a teacher and um --
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  -- yeah, I'm an elementary teacher.
R:  That's great.
L:  And it's ah you know I -- it's really neat to, you know, computers and education and here I am doing what I do, so um do you --
R:  Do you use computers in your classroom?
L:  Well, that's ah -- honestly what I was going to ask you.  I have not taught in eight years.  I'm going back to teaching this year, um, I was going to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- let my kids get a little bit older and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um of course ten years ago when I taught we maybe had five computers in the entire school --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but in my kids' school it's -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just amazing how much they do use computers and you know all of the ah resources --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that computers give them, so ah you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm really excited about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So d- -- I'm -- I'm sure you use them a lot?
R:  Well, um, we use them more and more here at BYU --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah what they do is they have a lot of the courses you turn in all of your homework --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you read about your assignments online.
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  Yeah.  So, they have a digital drop box that you can drop off your -- your assignments --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- syllabus is posted there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah I also worked at the missionary training center where all the LDS missionaries are trained to go on missions --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and where they learn the language and um I taught Spanish and we -- the whole -- e- -- education program there, the whole teaching program is done over the computers now.
L:  Oh, isn't that neat?
R:  It's super.  What we did --
L:  That really sounds cool.
R:  -- it is really, really good.  I wasn't completely sold on the idea when I first started using the computers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I thought that the -- the -- the teacher listening to the pronunciation was vital for the -- for the student actually realizing what he was doing wrong --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but this program they have, they can record themselves and then click on a button and hear what they said and then click on another button and hear what a native speaker said --
L:  Oh, that is neat.
R:  -- so that they can compare.
L:  That is neat.
R:  So, it was really good.
L:  Well, m- -- well, my husband took some online courses -- and I took some online courses too -- ah just additional education through our college here --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but um he took some courses through Phoenix and --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- it wa- -- it was really interesting how he could, you know, continue his education that way but he is starting Harvard in the fall.
R:  [MN]
L:  And is going --
R:  Really?
L:  -- to be doing that via the computer.
R:  Wow.
L:  And he's going to do that for two years and then go to the campus for two months and um [LIPSMACK] you know, finish it up there, but yeah, Harvard has a program that he's going to be able to a- -- you know, get into and -- and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- it's -- it's just really -- it's really neat.
R:  Did I understand right, he's going to s- -- he's going to do an online program through Harvard?
L:  Harvard, yeah.
R:  Wow.
L:  He is in --
R:  Good for him!
L:  I know it.  He is --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he's in the IT field and --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- we are um [LIPSMACK] well, another story, but he said that God just literally put it in his lap because it's the only thing that is offered online and it's in his field.
R:  Gee.  That is so --
L:  So, um --
R:  -- amazing.
L:  Yeah, it is neat.  But ah another thing that he does with the computers and education in a -- in a different light is my father in law teachers our Sunday School class right now.  We just finished old testament class --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- now we're going -- but now we're going into new testament --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's going to be for a year, but Eric records his sermons, or his lessons --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and puts them online.
R:  Are you serious?
L:  Yeah.  And he even has voice --
R:  That's awesome.
L:  -- voice bits and everything else on it, so people who are homebound --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- get to you know listen to some Sunday School lessons and it's -- it's pretty cool.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  It's really neat.
R:  It surely is.
L:  So ...
R:  Now, tell me more about the online course you took, 'cause I'm really -- I'm really um interested in --
L:  Oh what --
R:  -- finding out how that works.
L:  Of what he took?
R:  Didn't you take one too?
L:  Yeah.  I've taken ah two courses.  I took a couple through a technical school, I took a medical course --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um but it -- it basically is what almost what you know, what I'm learning from you that, you know, it had a syllabus and we had online chats and took our tests online and um really just communicated via computer and I never met my teacher --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- never met the professor, um and you know being a wife and part time worker --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it was really convenient for me because I could get of course my education, or further my education for my teaching degree and yet --
R:  Mm [inaudible] --
L:  -- still, you know, cook the meals and clean the house and be a mommy and be a wife and everything else.  So, I could sit at the --
R:  Wonderful.
L:  -- computer at ten o'clock at night and you know do my class work.  So --
R:  And how -- how did the tests work?  Did you --
L:  How does what?
R:  Did you sign an honor code that you wouldn't look up the answers or -- that's what I'm really intrigued about.  How -- how does a test work online?
L:  We, well we didn't um there was honestly, even if I had even thought about doing it, there was no way to cheat, um --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- no.  And she basically, it was a timed test --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think we had probably thirty to forty minutes to finish these tests and um, yeah there -- there was just no way, so you either knew your material or you didn't --
R:  Or you didn't.
L:  -- because it was -- it was a very quick test.
R:  Were there any of those tests that were open book and open notes or anything like that?
L:  Um, very few of them were and she would tell us, you know, communicate to us before the test, a couple of days before that, you know, week two would be an open book test or week seven, but we only had a couple of those.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So -- and mainly she graded us a lot on, you know, camaraderie between us and -- and chat groups and things that you know she could see that we were learning through each other.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it was -- it was a really good course and I enjoyed it.  I wish I could take it again, but it wouldn't do me any good.
R:  So the --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's great.
L:  So.
R:  So, the interaction between the students also happened through the Internet?
L:  Definitely, yeah.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  We -- and it was a -- it was a small class, we probably had nine people in it but it um you know we got to know each other through the computer and -- and through what we believed or not believed but what we were each talking about and could go back through and say, "I disagree with you here" or "I agree with you here because" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it gave a -- it gave a forum for us to be critical but yet agreeable, I guess.
R:  That's right.
L:  So and -- and you know we didn't meet each other, like I said, but um it still gave us that you know that ability to try to get to know each other and to learn a bit --
R:  That's awesome.
L:  -- about each other.  So, that was really nice.
R:  One of the most -- that's awesome.
L:  Yeah.
R:  One of the most popular courses here at BYU is accounting two hundred --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what the teacher did is I think it took him three to five years to finish this project of his of videotaping all of his lectures --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- to the class --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he put 'em in a couple of CDs, so you take the CD home and ah you actually see the teacher teaching and doing explanations and writing things on the board and then you would have the quizzes online and the tests online and then once a month you actually met with the teacher in a big auditorium on campus.
L:  Wow!
R:  So it was both online and on campus too.
L:  And see, I would assume from -- from doing something like that you get the students who really want to be in the class but yet um can learn on their own time and y- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would think it would cut down on absentees and you know cutting classes because if you --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- have to go to class once you know actually sit in an auditorium once or twice, I mean that would -- that would have been great
