R:  My name is Casey.
L:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Adrienne.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you, Miss. Adrienne.  Well, ah I don't think that elementary schools need computers so much as when kids get to high school.
L:  Yeah, I mean you could spend that money on better -- on ah teachers and draw you know better people into the schools.
R:  Mhm.  Ah, especially bec- -- especially right now.  I think there's going to be a -- be a time when -- when all schools are going to have computers but right now they get obsolete so fast um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe when it becomes more of an investment than something that you have to keep replacing every few years it'll be more important to have computers for everybody.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  What do you think -- I mean, didn't Bill Gates put a lot of computers in schools and like, you know, the giant food programs that put computers in schools um I don't know, they did in my area.  I was in DC and we would like constantly be turning in like our giant food ah receipts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to get these computers that then would end up sitting there because noone um in the faculty knew how to put them together [LAUGH].
R:  I've seen th- -- seen that happen, too.  Ah it's not so much of a problem up here, everybody's got computers.  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  I'm in Seattle, yeah.
L:  I didn't know that.  I live in Philadelphia right now [LAUGH] that's so funny.
R:  But ah yeah, Bill -- Bill b- -- buys computers for every school here and ah he sees to it that they get put -- get put together and used but ah I'm from South East Texas and right when I was leaving high school my high school got computers and they did sit for at least six months before anyone could hook 'em up.  Um s- -- some private investor donated the -- the -- the computers to the school, but he didn't allow for any money to train the teachers on how to use them.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so that was kind of a shame.
L:  [MN]
R:  But ah -- I -- I don't know, it's important to have computers in the library, of course, but ah -- I -- I've -- I've heard of some experimental schools trying to -- trying to get a -- get a laptop for every kid and letting -- letting them borrow them at -- at certain times, having certain assignments that have to be done on computer.  And I --
L:  Well, one thing that would be nice if it -- if they could get the text books over the computer so the little kids don't have to break their backs [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I don't know.  I can't -- I can't read on a computer though, I can't read a book, ah --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, computers th- --
L:  Do you think that's because of you grew up reading in a book?  Or ah -- if you had grown up reading on a computer, do you think it would bother you?
R:  I don't know.  I -- the -- right now and for probably the past years I spend about four or five hours a day in front of a computer, but there's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's still when -- when a -- computers are good for short information and I use computers to direct me to books but I -- if -- if I can get it on book form I'd rather have it in book form, it's just easier to look at and more relaxed for me that way.
L:  That's interesting.  A lot of people I've heard say that is -- and for some reason, like I find it easier to read for long periods in front of computers.  I don't know if I'm weird or not.  I think because like when I start to read in a book like I just start to slump in my chair --
R:  Uh- -- mhm.
L:  -- and I start to like doze off and I don't know.  But um --
R:  Have you ever tried to finish a novel in front of the computer.
L:  I actually have [LAUGH] finished novels but ah this is actually you know this is like kind of off the topic ah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but um what e- -- um -- I had these -- I had these temp jobs and like there was literally nothing to do but if you were like in front of the computer you looked busy so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I ah -- I did read a few novels um [LAUGH] at some temp assignments.  So, um, over the computer [SIGH] ah --
R:  You -- you just found them on websites or have you -- did you -- did you purchase a novel over the computer?
L:  Um, I've never done that, actually.  There's um some free book projects --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- sites, I forget what they're called, but yeah I've done, I've done that.  Um [LIPSMACK] yeah, but about education.  What about like college education like when they're starting to offer like degrees online?
R:  [SIGH] Hm.  Ah, I'd -- I don't think I could do that.  Um, I know the -- the school I'm going to, they have -- have certain night classes they advertise them for people who are busy and you meet in a chatroom and talk to a teacher that way -- the whole class does.  And I -- I've never seen that happen and it's -- it's not very popular, it's just -- just for people -- people who are working and trying to get some kind of associates' degree, ju- -- just a -- just to have it, but I don't think it's being pushed as -- as -- as formal education, you know it's ju- -- it's just something to get a degree.
L:  [MN] So, people aren't really taking those degrees maybe as seriously?
R:  Ah, I would say so, yeah.  It's not as serious.  But I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't want to do that, I -- I don't have any problem with going to the classroom.  Even -- even if I was pressed for time, I would rather you know, go -- go out of my way to make time than meet over a computer, I think.
L:  Well, I mean and if it's over the computer, I mean what's to stop people from like, you don't know that everyone's there, I mean, you know, um, you -- you -- I think I would get distracted, I would go off and play with the dog or, you know, do something and -- you know what I mean, just not be that focused on it.
R:  Yeah, I don't think I could --
L:  Talking to other --
R:  I couldn't focus --
L:  It'd become like a -- yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt.  It would be like a TV show or something for me where I wasn't really plugged in or something.
R:  Hm.  Mhm.
L:  But -- yeah [SIGH] so ... 
R:  But I -- I can't get by with- -- without computer in what I'm doing now.  I even -- I even do my math homework on computer.  I type it all up, just so I can save it.  It's easier for me to save files than keep track of paperwork.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Me too [LAUGH].  Yeah.
R:  So ah I -- I keep all my papers, I've -- I've got a webpage just -- just for my -- my schoolwork --
L:  What --
R:  -- and I just keep it there.
L:  -- what about the Powerpoint presentations in class?  Have you had those?
R:  Oh yeah.  Um.  I feel a lot better -- the -- the younger teachers all use Powerpoint and then the older teachers all still write on the -- the boards.  And it -- it just seems so much -- so much better when it's -- when it's on Powerpoint.  You don't have to take notes.  You can --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- you can go get the teacher's Powerpoint files.
L:  That is nice.  And it -- it seems to be more efficient, even though it always takes like twenty minutes to start class because the -- invariably there's some like last minute crisis of like the CD ROM doesn't read or something that --
R:  Oh, I've sure seen that too, but it's not going to be like that forever.  You know, there's -- there's going to come a point in time when computers become the way it's done and there -- they're going to have all the bugs fixed.  You know, it's just -- it's just new technology.  Schools ha- -- it's all been installed within the past five years and they've still got a lot to work out.
L:  That's -- that's true, you're very optimistic about it [LAUGH].  Do you think um there's geographical differences in the way people think about computers, like ...?
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Um, back in South East Texas they're still kind of -- they're -- they're still mighty new.  There's -- there's rural areas out there --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that are just getting computers and ah --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I've -- I've seen plenty o- -- plenty of places down there, plenty of towns that don't have computers, you know, you've got to drive to the next town and go to the library if you want to -- want to see a computer.  And it's a big deal.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.  There's -- there's plenty of places in America that don't have Internet that -- available.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um --
L:  That -- I can't imagine.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, I -- I can't -- I don't know how people would function [LAUGH] without the worldwide web, I mean it's like the source of all human knowledge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like everything's there.
R:  My -- my grandparents live out in ah -- in the swamp Alousiana[?] in a small town of about three hundred and ah you know they -- they -- they asked me how -- how did I learn computer but the fact is I -- I never learnt how to use a computer, it just -- it just came to me like -- like English, I never had to work at it, I just -- I've been doing it my whole life.  And ah I've tried to show them how to -- how to do an email and it -- it -- it's just something they're not going to be able to learn or ever figure out, you know, it's not worth it for them.
L:  Oh, yeah.  One of my -- my grandmothers can't double click [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She just doesn't have that um capacity anymore.  But I think they have special mou- -- mouses like you know and they'll probably develop like easier things for well I don't know if they will, com- -- like easier things for older people or -- but by that time like we'll be the older people, so [LAUGH] it won't really matter as much, I guess.  But [LIPSMACK] [SIGH].
R:  I've -- I've seen ah -- there's a -- I used to go to school with someone who -- she had ah cerebral palsy --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or -- or something.  She -- she was c- -- completely normal mentally, but she just -- and she -- she could walk and everything, but there was something -- something with her hands that made her twitch and she had um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she had a mouse that she can -- she can move with her mouth.
L:  Really?
R:  It was a --
L:  Like with her tongue?
R:  Um, she could u- -- it was something she -- she could kinda hold in her hand and move it -- move it with her -- move it with her lips.  She could actually hold the thing but she would -- she could move a like a tube around with her lips and she could -- it w- -- you could blow in it to double click.
L:  That's pretty cool.
R:  But, you know, I -- I'm sure other people have ideas too and the -- the thing that she had to carry that mouse with her, she had to keep it with her because it wasn't something they just left in the lab.  You know, it's not something you share with somebody.  You put it in your mouth.
L:  Yeah.  I heard about this one guy who um he trained his computer using an EEG --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to like respond to his thoughts like he -- 
R:  Uh- --
L:  -- like he could have a thought like move the mouse cursor here and it would move there but [MN] you know, he had to train it for a long time and he like nobody else like it wouldn't work on anybody else, everybody would have to like train it individually.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I thought that was like so cool.  It was like something out of science fiction.
R:  [MN]
