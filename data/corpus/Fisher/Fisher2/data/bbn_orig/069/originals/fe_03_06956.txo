L:  Hi, I'm Debbie from Illinois.
R:  Hi, I'm Sarah from Virginia.
L:  [NOISE] So, we're supposed to talk about education and computers, huh?
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] I guess so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it's a good idea.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I love 'em.
R:  Yeah, because it's like my kids are learning things in elementary school now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they had -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That they taught me [LAUGH] 'cause I didn't know a lot about computers and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And then when they started learning they're help -- they're able to help me out, so ...
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I just bought mine this year and I'm on it right now.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I, um -- I learned, oh, probably about a year ago --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is when I first put my hands on the computer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I -- it took me a while to get through it but I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know it pretty good now [LAUGH] but, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like I said, if my kids didn't learn it in school --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, I --
R:  -- I wouldn't --
L:  I had a couple of classes in, oh, probably about eight years ago in college but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I don't remember anything. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's too --
L:  Nothing relevant anyway.
R:  Yeah, you just seem like you mostly do it by hands on, you know.
L:  Yeah, and everything changes so quick that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eight years ago, everything's different now.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause I never heard of that in -- when I was in school, it -- you know, computers weren't heard of back then. [LAUGH] I was in high school, like, in the seventies, so ... [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, all mine have computer literature as a class [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- in grade school.
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  Yeah, so do mine.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Even when my kids were in kindergarten --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they were learning it.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm, they learn early and they need to.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause that -- that's, um --
L:  [NOISE] Our world is nothing but computers these days.
R:  Yeah, that's true. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, if you don't know them, you're not doing very good. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I feel like I'd really be lost without it [LAUGH] and my kids use it for, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, their homework all the time and to do reports and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- all that stuff.  We --
L:  Oh --
R:  Go ahead. [LAUGH]
L:  And I think it's great they use it do their book reports, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if they can't type that fast, [NOISE] well, I can do it.
R:  Right [LAUGH]. And, uh, just like my son's getting ready to coll- -- go to college this year and he's able to go online and go onto that fast web and fast [inaudible] financial aid and all that stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  He's able to do all that right on the internet.
L:  Oh, yeah, and that really helps them out.
R:  Yeah, and -- and, you know, he was able to apply for scholarships --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through the internet --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- so ...
L:  That's why I say you have to know computers these days.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I just, uh -- I was really computer illiterate [LAUGH]. Like I said, like ab- -- up to about a year ago and when I first started getting on it was really, um -- oh, [SIGH] you know, I'd get really upset easy [LAUGH] because it was so hard to deal with at first, you know, but once you start getting into it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it, you know, seems like it starts to, uh, you know, be more common to you.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I didn't know how to do a lot of things at first, trial and error, I figured it out.
R:  Right. [LAUGH] That's the worst part of it but then once you get through that it's not so bad but, you know, when you're growing up as a kid and you're in school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you just learn it like you're learning math and science and everything else, you know.
L:  It's second nature to 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH] -- which probably means they're going to be a lot better typers than we are.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Lot, um, um, smarter and everything [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, 'cause they'll want to know how to do all that stuff.  You don't get anywhere without computers these days.
R:  Yeah, I think they -- seems like, um, you learn a lot, you -- there's just so much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  There's a whole world of learning on it.
L:  Oh, yeah, and I have computer programs [NOISE] you know, and -- that help 'em learn different things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, like, um, some things that kids aren't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're kinda slow on or whatnot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can get the program and, I mean, just -- sometimes they'll learn it just by having fun on it.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So ...
L:  Or most of the times they're learning stuff and they don't even know it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're just having fun playing.
R:  I mean, just like all these Nintendo games and stuff, they're nothing but computers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It's all computerized --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so they just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When they get on the computer, it's just so second nature to 'em.
L:  Yeah, and my guys have Playstation Two and X Block so ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got all them, too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah --
R:  They're, you know, just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's computer games.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah.  They're just so high tech these days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's a necessity that they learn it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- or they'd be behind everybody else.
R:  Yeah.  I tell ya that, uh, if you're in school nowadays and you have parents that don't have a computer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're almost lost [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Oh yeah, you're by -- you're way behind everybody else.
R:  Yeah, 'cause there -- I -- I mean, there was a time when I didn't have a computer and, you know, they were -- they were really in demand at the time --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know.  My kids had to go and use, you know, their friends' computers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff like that and --
L:  Or the library.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, mine had to do that, too.
R:  So, they, um -- seems like, you know, when the -- when the teachers can read their writing and their reports and everything and they -- you know, they give them better credit for that too, you know, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, school needs 'em, they just really need 'em.  Now when I go into, um, my son's, um school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the elementary school, the library's got nothing but computers in there.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, and they have, um, a computer room in mine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in my kids' grade school and also at the junior high and high school.
R:  Even in the, um, classroom --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they always have at least about three or four of them in there.
L:  Yeah, you just really have to know this stuff.
R:  But there's like little things here and there that, um, you know to go into the system and -- and see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how you can change your screen and do all --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, little things like that, all that stuff they learn at school, and that -- that stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I learned from them, [LAUGH] you know it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- little things here and there but things I wouldn't have known about unless someone showed me, you know.
L:  Yeah, my old [NOISE] -- my older ones didn't start learning as fast as the younger ones.  You know, they didn't start it as early --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- having computer class in school so they're kind of behind a little bit where the younger ones are.
R:  Yeah, I -- that -- I think that's good that you start 'em from the very beginning up. [NOISE]
L:  And then they're comfortable with them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause they're not really half as complex as they look.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Might take a little time to figure out what you're doing.
R:  I think they -- you know, by them being young, too, they absorb it much quicker and, you know, it's easier for them to pick up whereas it was hard for me to deal with at first because I'm grown and everything and [LAUGH] I just didn't, um, grasp on to it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like a child would, you know.
L:  Oh, it wasn't really all --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that hard for me.
R:  Yeah, that's good.
L:  Matter of fact, the older ones'll holler for me when they run into a problem.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And I just got on it in, like, March.
R:  Oh.
L:  So [NOISE] -- and they'll be hollering at me 'cause they can't figure out what they're supposed to do there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like changing the text size and all that stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, like you said, it's pretty much commonsense, you know, just to look at it and --
L:  [NOISE] And somehow you just go to play with it a little bit sometimes --
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  -- clicking different things and see what that says.
R:  Well, um --
L:  But the younger ones, you know, they're learning that so much faster.
R:  It's like my son's going to be going to college --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, in the fall and he's going to need a computer there, you know, in -- for his -- in his room.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, um --
L:  [NOISE] That's expensive.
R:  To do -- I mean, that's going to have to -- he's going to have to have one.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That -- that's what -- unless he just lives in the library all the time, [LAUGH] he goes and does his homework in the library or whatnot but you pretty much, you get into college, you have to do everything through that computer.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Well, as young as -- well, my fifth grader [NOISE] had to have, uh, his typed last year.
R:  Oh yeah, yeah, I believe that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, so as young as, like, fourth and fifth grade they're starting to make 'em type all the reports.
R:  That might be good --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because some of the kids just write so terrible [LAUGH] the poor teacher can't see, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I got a couple of 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, me, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Couple that write real nice and a couple that are terrible.
R:  So once my -- well, mine's in fourth grade now so once he gets in fifth grade maybe they'll have him start doing that, too.
L:  Well, it also makes them a lot better in -- in the world market, competitor wise, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because everybody's wanting computers. [NOISE]
R:  They start 'em out young and ...
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, 'cause when I was a -- when I was little, my dad said some day computers are going to be the big thing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and you want to get into computers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he always told me that of [LAUGH] -- as I was growing up, you know, when --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  When they come out, you need to learn 'em. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So he really knew what he was talking about, I just didn't take his advice. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And back then, you know, computers were so expensive, it's terrible.
L:  Oh, I know.  I shopped for one earlier this year, argh!
R:  Yeah, I mean, even, um -- even if you see them ones on TV or whatever, them Dells or whatever, they look like they're really cheap but after you get to talking to them they add this --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they add that and [LAUGH] you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ends up being more costly than what you thought it would be but --
L:  Oh yeah, because I wanted a faster one, you know, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you add more memory and all this and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I -- I got a pretty good deal on mine but if I had to do it again I would go get a Dell. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah, they are good computers.
L:  'Cause mine -- mine it -- it's crashed already, you know, and it's almost brand new.
R:  Well, I'm waiting for mine, mine's pretty old and it's real slow --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it don't have a lot of memory left in it, you know.  I don't think they could ha- -- add any more memory --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so I'm just kinda waiting along. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah, you can go buy a memory card for it.
R:  Yeah.  I have before but they -- they say that after a while [NOISE] um -- you know, after a while they just, um -- there isn't too much you can do to make it go faster, you know, 'cause it's just so old and obsolete.
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  But, I mean, you have to change 'em every coupla years now, it seems like. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So [SIGH] I really --
L:  [NOISE] I don't look to have mine any longer than two or three years and it won't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It might be high speed now but it won't be then.
R:  Well, um, that's what I mean and the kids, for them to do it in school or whatever --
