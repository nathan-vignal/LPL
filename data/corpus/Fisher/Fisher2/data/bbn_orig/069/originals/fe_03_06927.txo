R:  Hi, I'm Lindsay.
L:  Hi, I'm Joyce.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, do you think any -- any countries are a threat to the US?
R:  Ah, yeah, I would definitely have to say yes on that one.  Um --
L:  Um --
R:  And what about you?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, probably like North Korea and you know like some of the countries in the Middle East that we've [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going into [LAUGH].
R:  Right.  I don't know, but I mean I feel like a lot of um like it's -- it's difficult for them to necessarily like -- it's like that large scale, so like everything that we've done to them, like I mean it's pretty easy to see how like just like a small number of people can do such large damage.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And like you know you always hear about how like a lot of other countries are um like don't really like the US because we always like kind of strong arm and like you know do stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean go in and like you know change things so that it's better for us and [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't know [LAUGH].  So, I think we probably have stuff to worry about [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it was actually interesting.  I was just rea- -- I just got finished reading a book that was like all about um terrorism and stuff like that and this -- this guy went -- came to the United States, took a plane here and like oh, that's what.  There was like bombs on Libya or something or other and ah he like hi- -- his family was killed by these bombs --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- so, he like ever since then he decided it was his personal mission to like the find the eight guys and it was like a secret mission so he like came to the United States like just to kill the eight guys that were flying those planes.  I'm like, it just shows you like people just don't forgive and forget like they, you know, a lot of people just want to get revenge and everything and they're like -- it was scary.  Like, the book was written one chap- -- like every other chapter was written, um, in the point of view of the police force and then the other was written in the point of view of the terrorist, so you could like, like hear his thoughts and like he would say something like, "I'm standing with Paul right now and he doesn't realize that he's going to die in the next five minutes" like --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- so freaky.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, like it was weird and like they made like a few references in it to like the World Trade Center and stuff like that, it -- the book was written, I think, in ninety nine --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they made like different references, like "Oh, you know, it'd be really weird if those were gone one day" and like, freaky.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  But it was a really good book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ... um, yeah, I don't know.  I mean it w- it would be a lot different um I think if -- if the United States went about things in different ways, but then again like how would they go about things, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, because we have to look out for our own interests and then like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- there's always conflicts in other -- there are always conflicts in other places and that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they don't go -- you know, if we don't do something then that could also affect us [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's really scary to think like we weren't doing that -- we weren't doing anything specifically to like -- like the Arab nations and stuff like that necessarily before September eleventh and look what happened.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So ...  Um --
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].  Yeah and it seems like, you know, there are always like people that are super religious, you know, inside our country too [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  That [LAUGH] do stuff and like --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  -- it's like it's in the -- you can only like hold your guard up for so long before you have to say like, "Oh, maybe nothing will happen" and then that's what happens.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, freaky [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  There are very interesting topics on this thing [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  Where are you from?
L:  Um, I'm living in Rochester, New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  What about you?
R:  Um, Tahome[?], New Jersey.
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Near Philly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was interesting, I um went to school in Maryland, so I was nearby like DC at the time of September eleventh.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  So, like -- like it -- it was interesting how like everybody like in my family and stuff like that like freaked out like, you know, is she okay, whatever, like I had so many like phone calls.  And I hadn't even known what had happened at first.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So ... um -- and it was interesting to see, like it was interesting the reaction of everybody.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, I mean it's freaky because there's so much that can go on, like in our country, that we're not aware about until the last minute.  Or until it's too late.
L:  Yeah.  And it's weird now like with the whole like um alert system or you know, like, alert levels --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and like everytime it gets raised and lowered and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like you -- I don't know, you get desensitized to it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what it means and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I know [LAUGH].
R:  I think that's a big reason how it happened to begin with is that people are just desensitized to it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Like, I mean, a lot of people initially thought it was just a plane accident that [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something like losing fuel or whatever the case may be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm.  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So.
L:  Mm.
R:  Hm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] What else can I say about it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I don't know.
L:  Un [LAUGH].  Um --
R:  They give very, very, very open ended questions, but --
L:  Yeah.  Have you done this before?
R:  This is I think my third time, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  This is my first one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The first --
L:  Like every time they -- every time it called like I'm like at a bar or something [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You know, so I'm like, oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- can't really do this [LAUGH].
R:  The first time I -- the h- it was like the worst question.  It was asking us like if we wanted to go back in time, like to redo something or whatever, like what would we do and it was like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the quickest ah we both like said one thing and we were like "Ah, how are we going to do this for ten minutes?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, yeah --
L:  That's funny.
R:  But I think it's pretty interesting, like the questions that they do ask, but ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So ... [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Hm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it was hard to talk about something at all for ten minutes [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  For ten whole minutes [LAUGH].  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH] Can I think --
L:  So, well, do you get concer- -- I mean, I don't know, like I've got desensitized to like when other countries get bombed or, you know, like stuff happens outside of the United States.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I mean because you hear about it all the time and then like it's not immediately affecting, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anyone, you know, in [inaudible] --
R:  I know what you mean.  I actually have a few friends that are like living in Israel right now.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, that freaks me a lot.  Like one of my -- I have a friend who got married in -- what year?  Two thousand I think it was.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  No, two thousand and one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they've been living there ever since and ah like she had sent an email out saying that her husband just got drafted to the Israeli defence force.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  Like -- yes.  It's really freaky.  And like a friend of mine is deciding that she's going to go to Israel in ah -- in August for ten months and she's like do a study abroad type of program --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it's cra- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like it's interesting because I went to Israel a few years ago and like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I feel like in my mind like I feel like it was the safest that it's been in a long time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when I was actually there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But like it's freaky to like I remember my friend was there, my friend is going back in [inaudible] month, like she's been there quite a few times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and ah I know like one of the times that she came back and it was like bombing like two weeks later she was like, "I was standing on that street two weeks ago".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's like, it's really like -- it's freaky because although we're not anywhere near it, it's so close to home because I know people there and I know people who --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have been there and are going back.  And I've been there and [inaudible] like different streets and whatever.
L:  Wow [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  Like, I remember actually there was one day I was up really late like writing a paper, I think, and um I -- all of a sudden I got an email and my friend's email was like, "I just wanted to let you know, we're okay" and that's all the email said [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- and like, I was like, "What the heck?", so I went on to like Jerusalem oh Jerusalem Post dotcom and I looked up and there had been a bombing like maybe up one town over from their house, or something.
L:  Wow.
R:  And like I wouldn't have even had any way of knowing about it except --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the fact that she like emailed everybody.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah, I definitely like -- it's scary to think that there's so much going on with other countries that we have to -- we still need to be concerned about.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It scares me.  I -- I'm like, I'm always scared like maybe there will be something else that's going to happen here, but then again, like how much can you actually think about that before you're like you're just paranoid about everything.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know like every time like a major holiday comes or, you know, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- something happens and like I'm always thinking, well, you know, like maybe -- because, you know, like you always hear like the reports of you know they found out about something that was going to happen and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and I don't know, like, I mean, I know like they're -- like the efforts are a lot better now, but [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  Things can always get through and [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know [LAUGH].
R:  How do they even know, like, about um [LIPSMACK] what do you call it?  How do they know or not?  It -- it's strange to think like how they know enough to make it like code orange or whatever, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just change the level of security.
L:  I don't know, they always like write about like you know the intelligence reports and [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah.
