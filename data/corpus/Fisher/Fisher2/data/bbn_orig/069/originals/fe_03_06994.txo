L:  Hello.
R:  Hey.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hey, how're you doing?
L:  Hi.  Um, I'm good.  How are you?  My name is -- 
R:  Oh, I'm -- 
L:  -- Sara.
R:  -- I'm just fine.  My name is Misha[?].
L:  M- Misha or Neesha.
R:  Misha with an M.
L:  With an M.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, that's different.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  The topic of the day is what do you think about education and computers?
L:  Well, when -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- when they first called in and they said, "Education" I thought, "Oh, that's good".  But -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then when they said, "Education and computers" I -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- thought, "Gosh.  How can you --" 
R:  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  "-- talk for ten minutes on that?"
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um, [MN] education and computers.  Wow.  I -- I -- I -- I -- having been out of school for a long time -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, and -- and not having had computers when I was in school, I -- I guess it must be a good thing for those that are in school right now.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, when I think about education and computers, I mean like for me, I used to, um, go to college and then, you know, I wanted to stay at home, you know, with my mom and stuff like that so I actually I got my education from home over my computer so actually I think computers, you know, are good and then they can be harmful, you know, for kids and, you know, other education, you know?  I [several inaudible words] I mean, but I graduated from, ah, high school, you know, at home on my computer.  So, in a lot of ways it's hampering.  You know, it can be harmful too.  So -- 
L:  Oh, you did?  Wow -- 
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I -- 
L:  So, you -- you did all the course work, everything over the computer? 
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's what -- everything over the computer from high school.  I got my high school diploma from home over my computer.  Also, ah, my licence.  LTM licence.  I used to -- I -- I -- at first I attended Phoenix Arizona University and so, you know, I wanted to stay home, you know, with my little boy.  So, after that, you know, I just, you know, did it from home and graduated and got my licence.  So, computers can be, you know, good, you know, in certain ways and some things, you know, can be harmful, like, little kids go over there and talk and things, you know, and pick up, you know, the wrong information.  So, it's a fifty and fifty, I think. 
L:  Really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  Fifty, fifty.  I'm surprised -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you would say that h- -- you know, that percentage considering that you did everything from home on a -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I mean, I -- I grew up, um -- [MN] there w- wasn't a computer in my house.  There still isn't a computer in my parents' house.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, it -- we have a computer at home.  Ah, actually we have two.  My husband has a laptop.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, he is a, ah, system engineer on -- on computers.  So, that's his thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Um, and my kids know -- both know how to use the computer.  So, you know, it's -- it's -- and -- and they -- they love to get on the computer.  Right now they're real- -- they're little so they're only playing -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- games.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I'm sure it's -- it's going to be a huge help for them as they get older and, ah, with their school work.  The one thing that -- that I notice though and especially with my husband who -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- works on computers all the time is that -- that you don't really develop any handwriting skills.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really.
L:  That's the bad thing about it.  I mean, my husband's handwriting is horrible.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He cannot write property because, you know, he -- well, he never [MN] really tried to, let- -- to write because he was doing everything on the computer.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause, um, I mean, there's so much stuff on a computer these days and so much stuff that a computer, you know, can do so, you know, you can get education from home like home jobs and you get opportunities from home.  You just go in there and type in, there's a thousand things come up, you know, for the computer.  It -- it is real good these days.  I mean, you can go on there, it can broadcast the time and temperature.  So, actually this is good, you know, and there's a lot of bad things on the computer these days too.  So --  
L:  Right, I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it -- they're -- they're -- they're all.  But, I think -- I think that's most of the [MN] -- the bad stuff is -- is there for the people that are going to look for it.  I mean, I don't -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- think everybody -- 
R:  That's right.
L:  -- the regular every day person is going to get on a computer and start, you know, looking for weird nasty stuff on a computer.  That's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're always going to be those kind of people, you know, whether or not they've got a computer to -- to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to -- to find it or not.  I mean, it probably facilitates them in a lot of areas -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, ah, ah, really, um, it's not going to stop them from doing whatever it is bad that they want to do -- 
R:  Yeah, that's [several inaudible words].
L:  -- I -- I -- I don't think.  Um, [MN] but, yeah, the one -- like, ah, ah, for me, the one bad thing would have to be [MN] the -- the handwriting issue.  I mean, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when -- when I used to do stuff at school and used to hand in reports and essays they were -- you know, that was part of the -- part of the -- the -- the overall grade, I guess you could say is -- was -- was the handwriting and how neat it was.  Now, you do everything on a computer, everybody's can look the same.
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree 'cause, ah, I mean, like -- 
L:  I mean, how -- 
R:  -- you say -- 
L:  -- how can you -- how can you differentiate?  And -- and I think also you've probably got a lot -- a lot of kids' parents doing more stuff for them now because they can use a computer better than the k- -- the kids can sometimes and can probably help them out a lot more.
R:  Yeah.  I agree, 'cause I mean the computer is good for little kids, you know, that, you know, can't really read, you know, at certain levels and stuff.  I mean, [several inaudible words] finding software so they can download, you know, for free.  There's a lot of, you know, good educational -- 
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  -- things on the computer these days.  You know, there's a lot of bad things, like you said, negative people, you know, who look for bad things.  You know, tampering some bank accounts.  You know, computers, you know, that's a lot of people [several inaudible words] to you know and stuff like that.  But, to me it is -- it's education 'cause f- for what it did for me, you know, is a blessing and I think computers these days are good.  You know, they build them in so different ways, you know, the kind that you can tote around, you know?  They make them all different styles these days.  So -- 
L:  Oh, absolutely.  It's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's definitely -- it's definitely, ah, it -- technology wise has -- has advanced so fast and it's definitely a huge help in a lot of different areas and, ah -- and education, yeah, I think it's -- it's -- it's maybe helped to improve somewhat.  I mean, but -- but even in my k- -- my kids' school they don't -- they don't have, you know, too many computers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's only, like, maybe one per classroom.  I think -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they have a computer lab where they g- -- the classes can go but so -- so, at -- at their age, I don't -- I don't know about later in school.  My kids are only in elementary so I don't know -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- about middle school or high school unless they use computers on a more regular basis.
R:  Yeah.  I know down here what I seen in Arkansas w- when -- when, ah, my little cousin, you know, he goes to the lib- -- the li- library every day.  You know, these days, you know, the -- the school make 'em is where they can't type in nothing else but, you know, educational stuff, you know, that's focussed on school and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They just can't, you know, go in there and type on, you know -- you know, just stuff.  There's [several inaudible words] school down here that -- that's how they're going to fix up.  But, I mean, that --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible], yeah, it's -- it's neat -- 
L:  Well, I would -- I would -- I would assume most of the schools are like that and that's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, we have a program like that too and, ah, on ours so that they can only, ah, access -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the -- the kiddy web sites and -- 
R:  Yeah.  Stuff like that. 
L:  -- and -- and things.  Um, but the ed- -- yeah, there's -- there's so -- there's so many -- there's so many educational areas though on the computer they -- where they can play and do stuff for free -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is really great.  Um, [MN] -- 
R:  Yeah, it's just, I mean, computers these days, I mean, there's just so much great things out there.  I mean, computers are so educational these days, you know, you can get on there and type a l- -- just education and you know, it's so much -- so many colleges and stuff like that, you know, come up, you know, things.  Material things to learn from.  They're just -- they're just awesome.  You know, people -- I tell them every day, you know, that's how I got my education.  And they're like, wow, you know?  And that's the -- I learn faster, you know, working at home, you know, 'cause I understand, you know, more working by myself.  You know, like, I get nervous sometime I might run a lot of people -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, and trying to, you know, do work so I mean, I got [several inaudible words] at home, like three months my high school diploma.  So, I mean, computers, it's good too, you know?  And they -- and too can get you into a lot of trouble if you, you know, are trying to do illegal things on the internet too.  So, yeah -- 
L:  Right.  No, I -- I -- I -- I -- I definitely think the benefits out weigh -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the -- the negative aspects of it, um, and -- and that's really great that you were able to do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, if -- if -- if you're able to get access -- I mean -- I mean -- I mean -- I mean you can even go to the library -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you don't have one in your home.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The local libraries have them for you to use for free which is great.  Um, so, you know, at least you can get access to it if you -- if you -- if you don't have one at home.  But, I would think most h- -- most households these days have --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, h- have a computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [SIGH] it's -- it's n- -- it's not so great for the -- for the, you know, I guess -- I guess poorer -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- families that aren't able to afford it because it's not really -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a necessity.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I know the -- the computer -- ah, our computer library down here, you know, they -- you know, when you go on -- on the computer and type in the address [inaudible] and then when you go later on, you look, you pull it down you can -- you know, the same thing you typed there with earlier -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that they, um, well, what I say, they -- they're finally stopping that 'cause a lot of people used to go in there and you know, and email their friends in different states about drugs and stuff like that.  And they stopped that so basically my library down here is -- is just based on educational things.  I think that's great too.  I mean, there used to be a lot of things they type in, you know, nasty people on there so --  
L:  Oh, really?  They -- 
R:  -- and they stopped -- 
L:  -- were doing that?  Wow.
R:  Yeah.  Like, you know, W.W.W. dot porno or something like that.  They stopped all of that.  So, you go to this library where I live it's just based on educational things within the library, on history and science and stuff.  So, that -- that -- that, ah, they cut down on a lot of stuff like that too.
L:  Oh, wow, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] I realise [several inaudible words] -- well, of course they can see where -- where people are going.  But, ah, well, that's just really cool.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I say too.  I mean, I got a computer at home and I mean, I go on it every day, you know?  I look up educational things.  There's so much stuff, you know, I see you can download for free for your, like, kids, you know, to read like books and stuff like that and they have the word, you know, and -- and a lot of symbols you can break 'em up --
