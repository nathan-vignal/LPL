L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  This is Fr- --
L:  Hi, my name is -- oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  My name is Frances B Springer.
L:  My name is Amy.
R:  And I'm from --
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Fine.  I'm from Durham, North Carolina.
L:  So, oh, we need to talk about the Middle East.  What do you think about everything that's going on?
R:  Well, I really don't know.  I think they got a line for -- oh, so far as the television's concerned, I think they got a line for us and they got a line --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.  I don't know.  It's sorta hard to tell when the media gets it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- it's just ca- --
L:  I don't think they tell the whole story either.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  'Cause I just -- I'm just looking at the news just a while ago and you know the little girl that got -- got hurt over there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [inaudible] they said -- said that was a wild story --
L:  Really?
R:  -- so they're going back -- uh-huh, they're going back and investigate.
L:  Really.
R:  Mm, that story she told, you know.  And her parents say her mind is good, they was trying to say she was a little baby or something --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but her parents say her mind is good, but they don't know the story yet --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but there's going to be a military investigation; that's the last I heard just about ten or fifteen minutes ago.
L:  Oh, I hadn't heard that.  Wow.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  And you know, it was just before I made this call --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I was looking at the eleven o'clock news and they um [LIPSMACK] one thing I think -- it seemed like to me when the United States went over there, it looked like they did a good job, I think, but [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think they should have stayed there and protected them, you know, from the looting --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and protect -- protect [inaudible] too, you know, instead of just pulling out so quick --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't believe so many [inaudible] soldiers would have been killed if they had left people arou- -- surrounding them because [inaudible] one or two get killed about every other day now --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- other there in Iraq.
L:  Yeah and they -- they I think if they don't get Saddam Hussein out of all this then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody's died in vain.  I think that that's the whole purpose when -- I know they say that the purpose is to give them a democracy, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think, you know, he's going to do it again if they don't get him, they need to get him.
R:  [MN] That's what -- that's what I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause that's who they were going after, they said.
L:  Yes.  They didn't get Osama Bin Laden either and I mean --
R:  Yeah, I know and --
L:  -- you know, you got to get these people, they got to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- focus on that and get them because if they don't all those people --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- all the soldiers that died or -- it's just really said.  I think they you know if the US doesn't do something about that and I mean I -- I'm sure if they could find him they would, but I -- I just think we -- we cannot leave until we've found him.
R:  We find him.  That's right.
L:  You know.  I --
R:  Because he be hooked up with Bin Laden after a while.
L:  Oh yeah.  He'll be planning something --
R:  That is [inaudible] --
L:  -- else.  So --
R:  Yeah.  And they -- and you know what, and they still haven't found all those ah nuclear weapons, you know?
L:  No.  Which is interesting.
R:  And they say -- I saw a picture on TV where they got -- they got a lot of stuff underground.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, they've got like -- I've heard that -- that um he's got like an eight storey down building that's eight stories underground --
R:  Down in the ground, yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, that if they drop bombs on it, it's not going to even hurt his building under there.
R:  Uh-huh that's true.
L:  You know, and he's -- he's got 'em everywhere and so I just think --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's probably out of the country --
R:  What --
L:  -- but, you know he's b- -- he's --
R:  They talk like he was in Baghdad, I don't know.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, 'cause they talked about Syria --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe that Syria was hiding him and giving him weapons and ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's an awful thing, though.
R:  Well, they went into his place where he stayed at Cable Television, had his bed there [MN] and jumped on it, say he had a good mattress and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and you know that walls -- that wall was something like um four feet deep --
L:  Mhm.  Wow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  He's not going to want --
R:  And they have a mask down in there, too, you know, for nuclear --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- attacks and then they have another machine down there to I guess they do away with that if -- in case of a nuclear attack. They got -- got a machine sort of like -- it looks all like an air conditioner or something --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- that -- that they can use in case of a nuclear attack and they'd be down underground --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you saw all these gears, they -- they could put on, you know, the masks and all that stuff [MN].
L:  Geeze.
R:  And all that stuff, go deep under the ground.
L:  Mhm.  And see, they need to destroy all that stuff, too, because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, if he were to come back, ah he's already got that stuff you know ready to go for next time.
R:  Yeah [LIPSMACK] --
L:  But --
R:  -- and then -- and then but you know they -- they still searched in that building.  I saw where they're tearing some walls out, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and now w- -- that's where they found the gold [MN] --
L:  Oh, really?  I never --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- even heard they found any, oh wow.
R:  Oh, they found -- they -- they tore some wa- -- the wall was really l- like cinder block --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- but they tore those walls out and found some gold --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you know and I guess you saw them when they opened that -- that vault with all that money?
L:  No, I didn't ever see that.
R:  You didn't?  I saw it on a whole of United States money --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and then they got some of the United States soldiers, they -- they -- they said they captured them 'cause they took some money, you know.
L:  Oh.
R:  But um, I don't know how that ever come out with the picture on TV, they were just in blocks --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- just blocks of money, just blocks and blocks --
L:  It's too bad they can't take that.
R:  -- I guess it's about two -- it's about two or three feet high.
L:  Oh, wow.  No, I never saw that.
R:  All that money.  Mhm.  It's [inaudible] --
L:  It -- it's too bad they can't take it and give it to the people, you know, distribute it --
R:  Yeah, what --
L:  -- evenly.
R:  That's right.
L:  Because he's taken all their money from them all these years --
R:  He sure -- he sure has, uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  That would be --
R:  But e- -- but they're trying to set the country up now for democracy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they say they've got a split there that is something to do with the feeling there for Saddam Hussein.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, he had followers that are just -- are just never going to want to change.
R:  And I believe some of them won't believe, but they don't want to show them that they won't believe, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  So, you got a group like that, so I imagine it's kind of hard to get it quietened down, but they're giving up and surrenders and I don't know --
L:  Yeah, I think some of them had the good life for so long with him though because you know all the people that surrounded him, they had money too and it was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- all the people that they took the money from that are -- are really happy about this and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- m- -- you know, now there -- those people that were so greedy are gone, well, now we're going to have to share and you know --
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  Awful.  But --
R:  But you know, it's not a bad [inaudible] long time [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something like this happened.  I think it just pays to live straight all the time, so you can go to bed and rest.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Where -- where -- where do you live?
R:  Durham, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay.  I live in Washington State.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I haven't talked to anybody in North Carolina, so this is my third call.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is -- this is my second one.
L:  Yeah.  I talked to -- I talked to somebody --
R:  I saw the --
L:  -- in my own State and somebody in Texas and now North Carolina, so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- wow.
R:  Yeah, the -- the last one I talked to was Washington DC.
L:  Oh.  Mm.  This is really kind of interesting.  I don't know what they're going to do with the information --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but it's pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think it's interesting too 'cause a lot of times, you know, you stay round the house and unless you want to talk to somebody that's interested in what you're interested in.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And um, it's good 'cause I -- I'm -- I've been sick about um -- ever since last December -- I got burnt.
L:  You got burnt?
R:  I got burnt [inaudible] home --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- and then -- and I'm in a wheelchair and it does me good to talk to people.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  I guess that's one reason why I see all these ah -- see all these -- this news 'cause I wake up sometime around two --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I can't go back to sleep and then I get the news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there's a whole lot of ne- -- it's a whole news after -- after one o'clock.  
L:  Yeah, there is.  That's pretty much all there is, huh?
R:  Mhm.  And I get it --
L:  So, you're feeling better, though?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Doing -- doing fine.  Yeah.  Doing fine.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and early in the morning I wake up early and I turn the TV on, where the news is, 'cause we've been having tornadoes down this way --
L:  Oh, you have.  That's right.
R:  Mm.  And I tell you, when they look at it, our -- our State when it tear up, it looks just like the Middle East.
L:  Oh.
R:  All tore up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I say, well, we getting tore up too, just like the Middle East.
L:  Yeah, it's amazing, when you see the devastation that happens from those, it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- oh, we didn't -- you know, we don't 'em, we have little tornados that will come out of the sky, but it won't ever touch down and I can't remember what they call those, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, but they -- I mean we've -- we're very lucky that we don't have that problem.
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.  And who knows --
R:  I guess --
L:  -- the way the weather changes all the time, we may end up --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- getting 'em one day, but at this point we're --
R:  I wonder if the Middle East get tornados and -- and ah -- I know they get sandstorms --
L:  Yeah, you'd think they would.
R:  -- but um -- unless it gets all in the -- all in the machines and ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- artillery and guns --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- gets jamming and in the eyes.  I mean, that's awful.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But they say --
L:  Oh yeah, that --
R:  But they say these --
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  -- [inaudible] comes the same time, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Same time of the year.
L:  Yeah.  That's awful, I can't imagine a sandstorm ugh.  They have to put up with a lot over there.
R:  Yeah, they sure do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm sure hoping they will catch Saddam Hussein e- -- go back, oh and sometime I just feel better, sometime I feel like our tax money is wasted --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- when they don't go in and -- and do the right thing
