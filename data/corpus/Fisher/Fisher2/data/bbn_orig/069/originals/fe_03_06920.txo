L:  Hi, I'm Liz.
R:  I'm Scott.
L:  Hi, Scott.
R:  How ya doing?
L:  Okay.  Where ya calling from?
R:  Ah, Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia?  Really?
R:  Yeah.  Where are you?
L:  [MN] I'm calling from Boston.
R:  Boston?
L:  From Boston, yeah.
R:  Ow.  Awesome.  I was born in -- 
L:  I'm not from Boston but I'm from New York but I'm in Boston now.
R:  Yeah.  That's cool.
L:  So, what country do you feel is a threat to us?
R:  Um --
L:  This is going to sound terrible, I'm going to tell you which one I think.  I think China and I also think Israel.
R:  Yeah?  
L:  Unfortunately, yeah.
R:  Why?
L:  Ah, because I think the United States has really put themselves out there, way too often.  And, they're not willing to back any particular side in Israel and I think Israel's really getting tired of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I think that either we pull out, although I think it's really too late, or we do something about it.  Unfortunately --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I think the people of Israel have suffered enough.  Both the Palestine and -- and Israel.  I dunno what they're gonna do.  Over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and China.  Hm. [SIGH] I think China because it's so big and it's -- I think, military wise, they're -- they are very hard on themselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I think at any time, that it could really happen.  I really do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, we're -- we're wasting too much time worrying about Arabs and -- when it's really our fault.  We just keep sticking ourselves out there.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I say, help the people, feed them, definitely help them.  But as far as their dictatorships in their own country, I think, leave them alone.  That's their --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's their thing.
R:  I dunno.  
L:  What about you?  What do you think?
R:  Um, I dunno, um.  I think, probably a lot of countries, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] Because you --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- draw too much attention to ourselves.
R:  Yeah.  We -- I mean, we -- we --
L:  I'm now -- I'm not one that thinks we should go out there and fight and war and all that.  I'm not -- I'm really not.  I mean, I'm from New York.  I worked in the Towers.
R:  Mm.
L:  I know people that have died in the Towers but there's an awful lot of other people that have died, besides our Towers, here.
R:  I know.  
L:  You know, before that.  Look at -- let's go way back.  The point is, we've always had an issue and -- and it's because the United States has to be this conglomerate and we have to look as though we are the leaders of The World.
R:  I know.
L:  And we get ourselves too mixed up.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that's what I think.  And we tend to be very opinionated from where we've -- from where I'm from so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I dunno about how Philly people are?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm originally from Wilkes Barre[?].
L:  From -- from where?
R:  Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.  Wilkes Barre [inaudible].
L:  From Pennsylvania?
R:  Yeah, northeastern Pennsylvania.
L:  What are you doing in --
R:  Now I'm in Philly, which is southeastern Pennsylvania.
L:  Yeah, what made you move to the other --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- other end?
R:  -- 'cause I wanted to be in a city.
L:  Ah, what happened?  You got tired of living out in the sticks?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] And here I'm from the city and now I'm living out in the sticks and I can't take it.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, there's such a big difference in the way people think.
R:  Yeah.  I would have moved to New York but --
L:  Oh, New York is excellent.
R:  A lot more expensive.
L:  Really isn't if you go and you get yourself a roommate.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It -- it really isn't too bad.  And if you don't live in the city.  You can't live in the city, forget about that.  But, you can live in the boroughs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One of -- one -- and don't go to Queens because that's -- forget about it.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't want to go to the Queens.  No.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Go to Brooklyn.  
R:  Uh-huh?
L:  That's where -- that's where I'm from -- I'm from Brooklyn.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  And the people treat you good there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's very diverse.
R:  Cool.
L:  So, now that we've sat on this phone, do they listen to all of our conversation?
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Are we supposed -- so, we're s- -- really supposed to just talk about countries that we think are a threat?
R:  Um, I don't know.
L:  Huh.
R:  I usually don't talk about their topics at all [inaudible]. 
L:  [LAUGH] I think this is, like, my second time I've -- I've done this.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I dunno what.  I've yet to see anything come, so I dunno what's going on.  Hey, listen.  In your -- in your state, do you have a place called Gillette?
R:  Gillette?
L:  The Gillette Co- -- yeah, Gillette Company.
R:  For razors?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not sure.
L:  Aw, you should look into that, you know.  They do surveys and you could get paid for, like, fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Honest to god.  I just did one for a toothbrush and I made two fifty on it.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, look into that.  I mean, if you're into, like, making money with no effort.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That's one -- see if they have the Gillette Company there.  [MN] And if they do, you sign up and just for signing up, they give you a, ah, thirty five dollar check, just for signing your name.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then after that, you can participate in any kind of study that they have, whether it's toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, shaving cream, hair products --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and get paid really nice for it.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, look into that if you've got it over there in your state.  We have it here.
R:  Yeah.  What did you do?  Go to the actually company or ...?
L:  Um, we had -- 
R:  Aw.
L:  -- a fl- -- there was a flyer that came in the mail from the Gillette Company.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I just called.  And when I called, they told me, "Come in".  And I filled out an application telling them my likes, dislikes and all the rest of that.  They ask things like, how many times a week do you shave?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Stuff like that.  What do you use?  Do you use a razor, electric, what?  Um, then they just gave me a thirty five dollar check, just for showing up and filling it out.  And then they send you out a PIN number, and an ID, and they call you on the phone, you enter that all in, they see if you fit that survey, and if you do, you -- you can go either in and do the study in there, in Gillette, or you could do it at home.
R:  Mhm.  Wow.
L:  I -- I went in, got the toothbrush, came home.  Did the study, got paid. [NOISE]
R:  Huh.
L:  Isn't that excellent?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, look -- look for that in your state.  I tell everybody about Gillette.  It's, like, the best.  See if you have it in your state or in your surrounding area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't think you have to live in a particular state to do the study, I mean, as long as you're close to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's one other thing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's cool.
L:  But you can get paid for it.  Yeah, isn't that cool?  Only in America. [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH] [NOISE] 
L:  Since we're talking about our great country, only in America that happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I know.  So, what do you think about our military men?  Do you think they -- and women -- you think they should come home now?
R:  Um --
L:  Do you care?
R:  Yeah, I care.
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  You know.  I mean, I don't know if all troops should be withdrawn.
L:  I -- I feel bad for the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I think they really --
R:  Yeah.  Like, I don't know if it should be an immediate thing, like, just take everybody out of there, but --
L:  But they're being killed.  You know that, they're being ambushed along the way.  Too -- now -- now they're starting to being -- starting getting killed over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I feel really bad for the families that are all here, and I dunno if you have family that are in the military --
R:  My dad was in the marines.
L:  Oh, really?  [LIPSMACK] So, see, you can kinda understand?
R:  In Vietnam. So.
L:  Can you -- can you imagine that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  I would never -- I tell my cousins and all, "Don't you dare join the army, as much as this is my country, but don't do it". 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because once you're in there, you're there -- their's and that's it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  God help you if you don't come back with, you know, this whole family -- there are so many over here, in Massachusetts, that have gone.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, you bump into -- every second person's got a son or a cousin or somebody over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I feel so bad for them.  At least in Massachusetts, they're very military over here.
R:  Are they?
L:  What about over where you are?
R:  Huh?
L:  Over where you are?  Are -- do they tend to be military, over there?
R:  Um, more where I'm from.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, in Washington and Philadelphia.
L:  Huh.  So, what do you do in Philly?
R:  Um, I'm not working right now.  I was a waiter.
L:  Oh, that's not bad.  You make good money doing that.
R:  Yeah.  But I quit because I was getting really stressed out there.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I -- I'm thinking of something --
L:  So, what -- what are you going to do now?
R:  I'm taking some time right now and -- I can probably end up back waitering.  You know.
L:  Go to Aruba[?] [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I went -- I went to go to Aruba, go on vacation, go to Aruba.  Place is excellent.  You'll never want to come home.
R:  I don't have the money.
L:  Borrow, beg and steal, well, I'm not going to tell you steal --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, you know, you know, the last of them that goes there.  Anything --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to get you -- your -- your butt there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hitchhike, you know, do something to get yourself there.  You'd never want to come back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They truly treat Americans there, really, really nice.
R:  Wow.
L:  They really do and besides, the weather, every single day it's like eight six degrees.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Warm as hell and, I'm telling you, you'll never come back.  Every day is eighty something degrees.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yup, and it rains for, like, [NOISE] two minutes and it's done.
R:  Cool.
L:  White sand, absolute white sand.  And the people are so nice.  Talk about getting a job over there waitering, you'd make yourself a mint.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Buy a timeshare and then make other people pay for your rent.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Me, I'm in real estate over here.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Do you like it?
L:  I [inaudible] -- well, not too many people are buying [SIGH] you know, nobody's got money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, not too many people are buying, so, I dunno, I may have to change my -- my career over here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was -- I was doing computer work but that's, like, really boring.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I needed people. [LAUGH] It's like [several inaudible words] so I got into real estate.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's like waiter --
R:  Yeah, I was [inaudible] to have a computer.
L:  Just like wait- -- ah, like what you were doing, waitering.  You must have met a lot of people, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how you did it.  I give you a lot of credit.  I give you props because that's way too close to the public for me.
R:  Mm.  See, ideally, I like coffee shops.
L:  Oh, you like coffee shops?  'Cause why?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're in and out?
R:  No, it's actually more personal.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, you get to know your customers better.  But you know a lot of regular --
