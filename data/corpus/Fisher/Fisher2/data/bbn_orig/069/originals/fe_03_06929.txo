L:  Alexandra.
R:  Yeah, hi, my name's Sema[?].
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Yeah, my name is Sema.
L:  Yes, hi, I'm Alexandra.  I -- I wasn't sure whether we were still on the machine or what was going on.
R:  Oh no, this is a cellphone.  Um, so I haven't actually done this before, but um apparently you just have a conversation about a topic.  Is that correct?
L:  I -- I -- this is my first time as well, but I think this is correct.
R:  Funny.  Okay.  All right.  So, the question is, "What do -- what does one think about education and computers and does it help or not?"
L:  Yes.
R:  Um [LAUGH] funny, I can usually talk forever but right now, I'm like, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, yeah, I think it definitely helps.  Ah, when I was growing up computers weren't that ah commonplace, um, but now it seems that kids are younger and younger and are able to use the Internet and there's a ton of resources out there that they can ah use and ah [MN] lots of things they can read about um that weren't as easy to access --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- when we were growing up.
L:  However, I think um when it comes to things like spelling, because of the spell check on the computer oh, we rely on it so much that when it comes to writing they don't know how to spell.
R:  Yeah, but they, you know that's the case in like possibly any Microsoft like, you know, Word document, they all have the spell checks, so I don't e- e- e- yeah, I don't really know how much of a problem that would be, because any -- any kind of -- any document, at least for years, I remember even when I was in high school, they would come do the quote unquote computer lab where everyone would write their first drafts, instead of on paper, on the computer  and I don't really know anyone who, unless they don't have a computer, have to write something, you know, on a piece of paper first.  Um, in which case that spell check would just sort of be ubiquitous, you know.  Um --
L:  So, you don't think spelling, or knowing how to spell, is going to be important in the future, or even now because of the computers?
R:  I think that the -- I mean, this is -- you're talking to someone who won like several spelling bees when they're young, so I -- I don't think it's a -- it's a talent you don't need to have --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't think that the um I mean I think you have  computers in the workplace as well, people spell check things all the time.  I don't even remember the last time I've seen a dictionary, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I even use the Internet when I want to look up a word.  Um, and yeah, I -- I do think spelling is -- is an important, you know, thing to have, but ah I don't know, I think overall as far as education goes, I think there's just a ton of stuff to be ah read and consulted in there and things I don't even know about, really, that I'm starting to more and more.
L:  Mm.  True.  Good.
R:  I think there's the web in schools these days, am I right?
L:  Pardon?
R:  They surf the web in like schools these days, don't they?  Elementary school.
L:  You know, I -- I -- I don't know, um, my child is seven, so e- they -- I know they have limited access to -- well, they -- kids have some access to Internet, but it's limited to I think like twenty minutes.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Maybe -- maybe like --
L:  But b- 
R:  Sorry.
L:  No, go ahead.  They're -- they're young.  I guess and but I -- I think pretty much every school has Internet right now and -- and computers.
R:  Yeah.  They're pretty -- everything [inaudible] like my younger siblings know a lot more about the computer than I ever did growing up.  Or even now.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, when I was in high school -- when I went to school, we didn't have any computers, period.  We had --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a class, but I never took the class, so I took a typing class, but that was on a good old typewriter, it was not on the computer.  But right now is different.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know, I am um -- I'm more of a, in some ways, a traditional person, so for me technology, even though I work with technology, I'm -- I'm sort of like I didn't necessarily accept it as I don't know, as a full [LIPSMACK] I don't know.
R:  Like I don't know everything.  I mean, that makes sense.  I -- I refused to use the email and Internet or any of that stuff till my compu- till my grades in college came out only over email, so if you didn't have email, there were no -- they went from being posted on -- on -- next to the doors to being in your, you know, email account, which I found so annoying, but if you think about it, it's so much easier than walking across campus to look at this list, you know.
L:  True.  That's true.
R:  So, but I just remember being kind of resistant to it, not wanting to do it.  But um --
L:  That's true.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  No, definitely -- lot a -- in a lot of ways it makes our lives easier and a lot of it, I mean I use my -- my computer and I sort of take it for granted, you know, but then if my computer doesn't work for some reason and I can't do certain things I'm used to doing, like, oh my god, you know, it does make my life --
R:  Nightmare.
L:  -- easier.  So --
R:  Yeah, totally.
L:  But um --
R:  Like, we do a lot of presentations where I work like all like PowerPoint and ah -- and the other day my friend looked at me and goes, "If we didn't have Google on all these images and" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "and PowerPoint, how the heck did people do slides before?" and I said, "Maybe they just weren't very good".  He goes, "I bet they just did a lot more work", ah like actually finding things, um, in the ah um like in different books and down and then Xeroxing them and I don't know, I don't even -- I guess if we didn't have computers we wouldn't have scanners either.  Um, I don't know.  I just can't imagine.  It's a totally different world, basically.
L:  Mm.  True.  Um --
R:  So, I don't know what else to say about it [LAUGH].
L:  I don't know.  I don't think there's like one answer or the other, or -- or um -- and there's ten minutes [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  I don't think I've given this topic enough thought to really -- to really um -- where are you calling from, by the way?
R:  Ah, New York City.
L:  New York?  I'm from Boston.
R:  Oh, okay.  How's the weather up there?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Actually --
R:  They're going to kill us.
L:  -- today -- I know -- today's the first day when we have good weather in three weeks.
R:  Really?  
L:  Yes.
R:  Same.  It's been horrible this year.
L:  We've had, well, it's good weather and it's in the seventies, so it's definitely not summer weather, but at least we don't have rain.
R:  Right.
L:  Which we've had for three weeks.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Just interesting thing is I thought there was like more rainfall, someone was telling me it's been twenty one out of thirty days like this month or something like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- except they said on the news last night that the rainfall is actually you know an inch less than the year before, but I find that hard to believe, it's been disgusting.
L:  Wrong.  It didn't seem, it seemed like much more.  I've never, I don't remember -- and I've lived in Boston for a number of years -- I never remember it being so bad, so grey and wet all the time.
R:  I know.  It's very dreary.  I finally feel like leaving my apartment today for a change, but I still haven't [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Getting used to being indoors.  Um --
L:  Well, there's always --
R:  -- actually -- sorry.
L:  Yeah, go -- no, no, no, go ahead.
R:  Um, I actually don't even own a computer, which is funny.  It's like I spend a lot more money on entertainment and going out and doing all this stuff and I'm at work so often that I can just use a computer there, but sometimes I feel very stuck not having it here, you know --
L:  Oh, and you said you were a student?
R:  -- so [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- or you were?
R:  I'm not actually a student, I'm actually, I'm working but and I'm usually at work and, just [inaudible] computer's going all -- it kind of makes me a little bit nervous, yeah [NOISE] one second.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN] Oh, good.  It's just a friend.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I get kind of nervous when I get paged [inaudible] um but yeah, I don't know what to say about this.  I'm not one of these like people who can just go on and on.  I can go on about my own stupid things, but if you tell me to stick on something, I really don't know what to say.  Um, I think that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kids and Internet as far as um like I think there's sites that I wonder how well things really are restricted, you know, and what kids really are doing on their own --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that their parents just don't know about.
L:  That's -- I'm sure the schools have put restrictions on what can be accessed from the school computers --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- but, yes, you're right, at home and a lot of parents are not even computer literate, they don't even know other --
R:  Like my mom wouldn't even think about you know checking on anything like that, or stopping anything like that.  She'd just be like, "Oh, they're on the computer, whatever", you know.
L:  Mhm.  True.
R:  But ah I think my dad would be a little bit more savvy about that kind of stuff, but --
L:  That's a very -- computers and also video games I think it's very easy also for the kids to get um to spend a lot of time, you know, in -- I just -- I know we -- I have a child and I want him to be outside, I want him to be playing, you know, I want him to be more active and he has a tendency, not so much with the computer but with video games --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if he starts playing it's like try to you know pull him -- pull him out, he does not want to get off, so I think with Internet, the computer's just the same thing.
R:  Even worse, right?
L:  Yeah.  He can get sucked in.  Next thing you know, you didn't do your homework and the day went y and so um ... I don't know, I guess when used wisely it's a good thing, but it could be so abused [LAUGH] that I don't know if it sometimes counterbalances the good things.
R:  And I think you're totally right.  Um, I'll get on it for like two minutes and then next thing you're like an hour and a half later I'm on some totally random topic that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just kind of w- --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- wasting my time, you know.
L:  Which at work, it's worse [LAUGH].  It's like sometimes, it's like okay, I'll go on the Internet and make the time go by faster, but --
R:  Basically screw around a little bit and surfing the net --
L:  Yeah.
