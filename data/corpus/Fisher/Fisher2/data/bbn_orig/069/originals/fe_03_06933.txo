R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Jasmine.
R:  Hi, this -- Lisa.
L:  How you doing, Lisa?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  That's good.  Wow, I think computers are very beneficial to the school today.
R:  I do too.  As a former teacher [LAUGH] that, yeah, I agree.  Ah, kids need the computers.  If they don't learn 'em in school when they get out into the real world, they're not ready to use the computers at all.
L:  Exactly.  In fact, that's what I have, is a Bachelors Degree in computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I remember when I went to college for this everybody told me that it was just going to be a fad and that computers were not going to, you know, go anywhere, I was wasting my time.  But right now I figured, you know, who's laughing now? [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  Both my husband and I are both um -- well, I'm a retired teacher [SIGH] I was a computer teacher, but I've been retired due -- due to um disability and my husband worked for a big company repairing the computers in stores.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Plus --
L:  And my -- that is so de- -- my husband's an IT ah, coordinator, Information Technology.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know
R:  He w- -- my -- he's a network systems engineer.  They run a network programming and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  So, and he just -- he retired recently after twenty years of security and went into computers [LAUGH].  He waited late in life.  I was early in life [LAUGH].
L:  Wow, that is something else.  Y- and in fact, I think they ought to start teaching the children even in kindergarten.
R:  Well, my -- my eighteen year old, my youngest is eighteen and um he's been on the computer since he was three.  And he's a -- he's a whiz with 'em but I've got all my nieces and nephews, I'm getting ready to start my grandchildren on 'em, I've been getting programs and stuff.  My two year old granddaughter, she's already playing on a computer.
L:  And the thing with small children are they -- they are not afraid like adults are.
R:  Exactly.
L:  They'll just go right into it and they have no qualms about, you know --
R:  W-
L:  -- are they going to hit the wrong key or are they going to mess it up, b- --
R:  I don't know, now I do have one.  I have a niece that's six that has computer anxiety.
L:  Oh.
R:  She -- everytime she would have computer class at school she'd get sick that day.  They come to find out, she was scared, she was afraid she was going to break the computer.
L:  Oh, wow, that is so strange.
R:  So, my husband built her a computer.
L:  There you go.
R:  So she'd have her own at home so she got used to it.  Because she was just like flipping out, she didn't want to do it [LAUGH].
L:  Wow.  But --
R:  But I think, yeah, I think the -- if they don't learn it now, they need to start 'em in kindergarten --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and most of the schools now are putting the computers in there.  The only thing that I don't agree with is I don't agree with them doing -- they still need to learn the basics of math --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and English. They still need to just pen and paper it.
L:  Right.
R:  No calculators, no nothing.  They need to learn to add and subtract in their heads.
L:  Yes.  Because otherwise they get so used to the computer doing it for you they can't do it on their own when they're out in the real world.  If they're shopping or whatever, they get change back, they have to know exactly what they need.
R:  Oh, I know exactly.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it's like my husband says, you know, when he's accidentally taken a whole store down and these managers are like handing paper and pen to their employees, they're at a restaurant saying, "Okay, do it manually" and these kids are going "Huh?".  They can't even add up simple addition because they've got used to using calculators.  So --
L:  Y- and yeah, and the computer, like Quicken does it for you.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You don't have to worry about that.  You know, and that's one thing I taught my son, in fact he's going to college for computers too because ever since he was little that's all he, you know, with my husband and I both doing it, he's learned the software, he's learned the hardware, he's learned how to take one apart, put it together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's very valuable to his friends because they're always calling him if something happens to their computer.
R:  Well, see now, my son says he hates computers.
L:  Oh.
R:  But he's been on 'em since he's three.  But he repairs everybody's computers, or he calls his step father going, "How do I do this?" but we try to get him to k- think about a career and he's like, "No, no, no.  I don't want to do computers."  Last week he comes to me and he's like, "Well, I guess I need to get into technology".
L:  Yes.
R:  Now, he's got a child on the way and he's realized, "I'm not going to make it unless I get a computer job".
L:  And -- and unless he gets that piece of paper because you're not going anywhere without that piece of paper.
R:  Yes, and he wants --
L:  Unfortunately.  Just like my son knows everything, but he needs one more year to get that piece of paper.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then he's going to go places.
R:  Exactly.
L:  That -- that degree.  Without that degree paper, you're not going anywhere today.
R:  Well, I think it's very beneficial for the kids to -- to learn computers in school.
L:  Yeah.  Your son should oughta try like a school like ITT.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, Information Technology ah, I forget what it's called.
R:  You know what's funny is my poor Mom she's -- she's turning sixty this year, right, and she wants to learn the computer.  Well, she's got all these grandchildren, she's got nine grandchildren, the youngest one that knows how to work a computer's four and they're all like "Nana, can we teach you?".  She just looks at them and goes, "No, I don't think so" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, she finally did let my son, because he's like one of the -- my daughter's the oldest at twenty one and my son's, um, eighteen, but the rest are from ten on down.  And she's like, she finally let my son teach her.  And she was like, "Oh, he is so patient" [LAUGH].
L:  That's the thing is, you do have to be patient with a lot of the people who are older because they're not used to this technology.
R:  Mhm.  That's what I'm doing now that I'm retired.  I'm teaching the older -- my husband builds computers and sells them on the side.  So, we get a lot of retired people and they're like, "Oh, my grandkids could teach me, but I'm not gonna -- I don't want to sit there and let my grandchildren teach me".  So, they hire me to come in and teach 'em.
L:  Well, that's a good thing, though, that you have the patience to do all that.
R:  I have more patience with them than being in the high school.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  When I was in the high school teaching web design, I was scared to death.
L:  Oh, gee.  Well, the kids are unruly though, today.
R:  Um, well, let me just say I was in a school -- the last school I taught in, most of the kid had -- most of the kids had ankle bracelets on.
L:  W- -- oh, you're kidding me?
R:  No [LAUGH].  No.
L:  Well, now, that's kind of scary.  
R:  Huh.
L:  At least you know that the older adults are safe and -- and they do want to learn.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  That's why they call you, because they do want to learn.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But there's a lot of kids, I mean I was even surprised at the high school level that I was teaching at that there was these kids and I was the last chance -- the school I was teaching at was a last chance school, it was a charter school, and there was a lot of kids that came in there that absolutely knew nothing about computers.  And this was a school that all the kids had laptops.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And they -- they didn't know.  They had went all the way through school and did not know how to use a computer.
L:  That is a shame too.
R:  So, I ended up -- there was a lot of kids that I ended up, you know, doing special tutoring with and got them to learn the computers.  Once they learned it they were like, "Wow".  It like opened up a whole new world for them.
L:  Yeah.  An- -- and on the Internet there's so much information that they can --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gather, you know, to help them with, you know, their school projects, their -- their science projects, their -- you know, so many reports that they can get and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  We put together --
L:  -- instead of spending, you know, an hour at the library having a look through everything, they -- they can have it right there in front of them.
R:  Right.  These kids put together a big presentation, my web design class.  I taught 'em how to go and search for things. They put this big huge presentation together, there was a big write up in the school -- in the -- the local newspaper about it.  They were showing pictures of these -- these websites that these kids did and a lot of these kids, like I said, these are kids that were failing out of school, this is a last chance for them, if they didn't go to this school they were probably going to Juvie, or probably jail --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- so, they were kids that, you know, that got left behind in the system, basically.  And I got 'em interested enough that they -- I mean, they just the -- the website that they put the -- the -- it was a Christmas thing and it was a different ah Christmas traditions ah through different, you know, religions and stuff and they put this together and it rolled together so well that the newspaper in the area decided to do a big write up on it.  It was -- it was great.  I felt proud [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I would be too, you know, c- --
R:  I felt good that I actually got some kids very interested in computers.
L:  Yeah.  And -- and just think where they're going to go f- you know, from now, you know, from that -- from here 'cause that's one of the hardest things to teach is, you know, children is graphic design.
R:  Well, and you know the thing was is I had a couple of 'em that were in gangs and I said to 'em "Where are you going with the gang?  Where can you go with an education?" and there was one kid that his mother come to me and she says, "You have completely turned around my child's life.  You have made him realize that this gang is not going anywhere, but if he was to continue with his education that he would go somewhere in life" and he had a child on the way and I said to him, I said, "Now, how are you going to support this kid through a gang?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- "But if you went on and got an education, got into web design and started making lots of money, you could actually support this child very nicely and keep your child out of the gangs" and that was his biggest thing, he did not want his child in gangs.
L:  Yeah.  And not only that, as he makes more money, he'll move out of that neighborhood.
R:  Exactly.
L:  So, you know, his child won't be subject to
