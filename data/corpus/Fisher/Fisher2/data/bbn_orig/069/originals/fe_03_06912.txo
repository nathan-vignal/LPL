L:  Hi, my name is Catherine[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Ree Smith from Minnesota.  Did you say where you were from?
L:  Oh, I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Our topic is for foreign relations?
L:  Yeah, if we [MN] if we feel though any other country is a threat to the US --
R:  Oh, yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There's -- there's probably plenty of 'em against us right now, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that they don't -- they're not really saying a lot, but I think that there -- there always has been.  You know, there's so many countries -- even the smaller ones now -- that I think are going to be a threat to us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that we're going to have to watch, you know, so o- -- most of the things now that we think that it's going to be just real easy, I think are just are starting to come to a head really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I think [MN] especially now that um we were involved in the war with ah [LIPSMACK] with um Os- -- Osama Bin Laden that there's other countries that are hiding him --
R:  Mhm [MN] --
L:  -- and then w- -- you know, of course that's going to cause problems because we, you know, what he did.
R:  Yeah.  I wonder if we'll ever know if he's alive or not?
L:  Yeah, I wonder.
R:  You know, I -- I forgot w- -- I can't even think of where it was where they said that he -- he could have gone to now that could be harboring him and stuff and, you know, and they're the ones that have chemical weapons and things like that.  There's -- there's got to be all of that out there in those countries that he's -- you know, that have paid for him all these ways and supported him --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  I- -- it wasn't just his country that would have been doing it all along.  You know, there's -- there's plenty of 'em that have been against us and stuff and it's gonna all of it, you know, now that we know -- in fact, I think they knew all along that all these countries have had stuff against us.  I think that they probably knew -- like they said that they knew that there was ah gonna be a hit in the United States before the Towers even got hit --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- so -- so I think that there's -- there's been threats to us, I mean years and years ago, not just the last so many years, I think that's you know, our intelligence knows that there's more against us than what they're telling us.
L:  Yeah.  And you know, it -- it used to be that it was just everybody worried about Russia --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, that that was the -- that was the big threat and I don't think the Middle East was -- was anything back in the -- the fifties and sixties, they weren't a real big threat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and of course we had the Cu- -- the Cubal- -- the Cuban Missile Crisis [MN] but now it just seems like most of the stuff is ah based in the East.
R:  Well, there's so much now that Russia has sold them things, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they've got.  So, the -- I mean, Russia's probably been helping them out all along --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're probably gonna find --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- out more and more --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- as we get into this more --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, like, you know, like they're saying that they didn't find any weapons of mass destruction, you know, yet but they found those trucks and stuff like that.  He knew that we were going to strike him.  He had plenty of time to hide it and he's got other countries.  What, is it Siberia, or that other one that's big though too that's -- that's hiding stuff for him?
L:  Yeah, um, [SIGH] I -- was it Pakistan or -- it was one of those other strange named ones that um they think he -- that they have missiles ah hidden in th- -- those countries.
R:  Yeah, because they -- they hide stuff.  And like that one guy said where they built this place for you know Osama Bin Laden.  You know, underneath the ground and he just went -- I watched that one program where they described it and it's like w- -- we could never get him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's no way and he's underground.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  So, if they could spend that much money you know and he's taken the money.  Now, I had my sister in law and them were over when the ah in Kuwait --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when that all hit the first time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they lost everything, but they -- they were saying how the people over those countries are treated so mean, I mean there -- there is -- they have no -- nothing.  You know, they just -- and that's why they're so against us because we have everything going for us.  I mean, they can't even walk on the streets without trying to -- wondering if they're going to get killed or anything by -- by their own people. 
L:  [MN]
R:  They don't know who would strike them next.
L:  Yeah.  Now, you would think that they would [MN] that they would want the United States involved.  I think a majority of it does, I mean the -- the -- the -- for example, the women over there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- how they're just so persecuted --
R:  Yep.  Well, they're so brainwashed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's just -- it's drilled into them that I am God and stuff and God, you know, is all almighty.  Well, where are they getting these gods from?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's what bothers me.  It's like, how can they teach these people, you know, the -- the how you're supposed to be doing this for Allah and all this type of stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that is -- that is what is so scary to me, that they can get -- well like, now, these young girls that are doing the suicide bombings and I think, "My gosh, these girls have everything to live for and yet they want to do something like this".
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.  Yeah, I think there was -- the first one w- -- that I heard -- that I heard about was when the pregnant woman was the checkpoint and she comes running out of the car and it blows up.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think --
R:  You know --
L:  -- she must have known.
R:  Oh, I -- ah -- they all know, they say that they just know.  And just now, not too many nights ago, I was watching a show where these other girls said they would do it too.  I mean, young, beautiful girls --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they would do this in the -- in all of these different countries.  And -- and why?  Why is their life so bad that they will do stuff like that?  That they have nothing to look forward to and they're doing -- they think they're doing this for their leaders and stuff like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's what's so scary that all -- and even like that one guy who, you know, I think both those guys -- I can't think of their um -- oh, I can't even think of their names, now -- that are always fighting over there, the Pakistan and the Israelian guy --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I -- mean, I can see their faces all the time and I think, "How can those jerks be like that?" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, they're just -- they both pretend like they're not doing something.  Well, these people aren't going to be doing this unless they're being told to do it.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  -- you know they -- they're not going to just go out and I mean, it's like if -- if we would go out and go do something like that we would have to be, you know, dictated and told that this is what you do and stuff like that, otherwise you wouldn't just go do that.
L:  Yeah.  And it's ah [MN] it -- I know after the September eleventh -- because I live here in Pennsylvania and New York for me is about an hour away -- and I -- and I know that the fear that I felt, you know, being so close over there --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and how it affects the everyday lives of people and then I watched a show about how some of the um muslims in the country right after September eleventh were affected by it, that they were people that -- that treated -- especially some of these children, very badly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because they were suspicious and I think that's a shame because the -- they didn't have anything to do with it.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Well, even here, I mean it's just --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I went out of my way because they would walk on the street here and I mean we're not -- where we were threatened by anything except that all of America were, but these people would walk and they looked almost like they were scared to walk on the streets and I went -- I went out of my way to say, "Good morning" to them or something like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- even what we -- I had gone to one of our casinos and this guy was rude at these people walking, he goes, "They don't belong in our" and he was "In our country" and he was being very vocal.  And I thought, "You are so rude" because they had just as much right to be here.  They are not the ones that did it.  You know, and I thought, "How can -- how can we judge the ones that are here like that?"
L:  E- exactly.  Exactly
R:  And I -- I'm -- I should have said something to him.  Afterwards, I thought, "That wasn't too nice of me not to say something to him because he was not making those people feel very welcome" and I thought, "We -- we -- we should not be doing that because just because these countries are going crazy, it doesn't mean the people that are here are all that bad" and w- -- I mean I -- the day when they got that Mosari[?] or whatever his name is --
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  -- we -- we were going on our way up to our lake place and we had to go right by the area, right where we had gone to school and whatever he was doing, that flight school.  And the FB- FBI were all around there and I thought, "What is going on?" and I wasn't putting it together until it hit the news and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean it -- it's -- there were so many areas that have been hit by this and by these countries being like this because I mean these -- these guys were in every single country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, all the countries are affected.  It isn't just the United States that was affected by this, you know, which is -- it's sad because there's so many people that are so innocent that have -- they're worried now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, because they don't know what other people are thinking of them and stuff like that.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I also think that [SIGH] the United States, in some of the countries that are a threat to us, we are viewed as a big, greedy nation that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that maybe we want to take over the world b- by stepping, doing what we did for the people when we did in Kuwait and then again here we did it in Iraq.  So, I'm wondering if -- if the other countries view us as a threat as if we would come to their country and do the same thing?
R:  Right.  And -- and we very likely could have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that keeps on -- if they find out.  Now, is it Turkey that's got the more weapons now?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- they think that Turkey is the one that's harboring um +Osama Bin Laden.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- I was trying to think of the name of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what I was listening too and stuff.
L:  [MN]
R:  And -- and if they are, then we -- I mean, we should go after them because it's got to stop.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We've got to show the world that, you know, this has to stop, that, you know, they're -- ah -- when they find all these graves and stuff of people like w- -- Bin Laden and all those guys and that they just kill --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like, "How do you guys -- how can you stand wanting to live like that?" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, when you're -- when they're taking so many innocent people and just putting them in mass graves --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you would think that they would -- all these countries would say, "We don't want that here" and --
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's, you know, like h
