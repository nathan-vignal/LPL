R:  Hi, I'm Christine.
L:  My name is Darryl.
R:  Hi, Darryl.
L:  Where are you?
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  I'm in Austen, Texas.
R:  Oh.  Pretty far.
L:  [COUGH] Mm.
R:  I think they do that intentionally.  So we might not accidentally know each other.
L:  So, what are we supposed to do?
R:  I guess we're supposed to talk about the topic.  Which is, ah, pretty good because I'm a teacher.
L:  Well, I am too, um.
R:  [LAUGH] Great.  
L:  Teacher educator.
R:  What do you teach?
L:  I teach teacher education.
R:  Get out of here. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yep. 
R:  That's pretty cool.  I'm just a regular teacher.
L:  Good.  What grade level?
R:  Right.  High school.
L:  What subject?
R:  English.
L:  Very good.
R:  But I used to teach computer science.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] well, then you ought to very be -- be very well acquainted with the topic.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]  So --
L:  So, what do you think?
R:  Of course I think they're, ah, that computers are great in education.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It --
L:  I don't think there's any question.
R:  No, no.  I think it's --
L:  I mean, how could you have a contrary opinion?
R:  -- probably not debatable. [LAUGH] You know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's not like calculators in -- in second grade math or anything.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I, ah, I'm -- I'm big for the [PAUSE] use of computers in just about every subject.  I think every subject.
L:  How do you use them in English?
R:  Um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- well, of course there's word processing but then there's looking up information, if you're reviewing something or --
L:  Per- -- things and stuff.
R:  Huh?
L:  For writing things?
R:  Right.  Um, there's a million and one uses in English.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You, you know, you have your research.  You have, um, finding out how to use Word, how to format, like, bibliographies and so on.
L:  Mhm
R:  You can find all that stuff on the net.
L:  That's right.
R:  Everything.
L:  Well, Word does most of it too, just by itself.  You can do all the formatting and everything.
R:  It does do a lot of it.  
L:  Yep.
R:  It does.
L:  And, of course, the number one, most important reason to use it in English is?
R:  Spell check.
L:  Spell check.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm waiting for a pen that has it.  So ...
R:  A pen? [LAUGH]
L:  A pen that has spell check, but in the meantime, the computer's absolutely number one, that's neat.
R:  Yeah.  Kids depend on it a lot when they're -- when they're typing up papers but, ah, I dunno, I don't think the spell check is such a good idea.  You can --
L:  Be- because it teaches them to rely on spell check rather than their own understanding?
R:  There you go.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's it.
R:  Sometimes you can find the funniest errors, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- words that are homophones that -- that misuse.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they'll never know they did it.
L:  And my son had the other problem, his -- he couldn't get the spelling close enough to even let the word check recognize it.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] That's pretty bad.
L:  He siad, "What good does -- does word check do or does a dictionary do if you can't even -- I mean they don't tell me how to spell it and I can't get close enough for 'em to recognize what it is?"
R:  Yeah, it's like some modernized version of look it up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  How do I look it up?  Okay, so we're in total agreement, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Sorry, no debate here.
L:  None at all.  Just, should use it and -- and, um, also, I just think that it's -- it is obviously the tool that every -- everybody's gonna use, no matter what their profession.  If they're going into auto mechanics or medicine or pharmacy or [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- you know, sales clerks or whatever it is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're always are going to have to have computer knowledge any more, from now on.  You're -- it's just not gonna be possible.
R:  Yeah.  Just --
L:  So, it would be a great disservice for any school system to not teach the full ramifications of, um, [LIPSMACK] of computer use.
R:  Well stated.  I absolutely agree.
L:  Well, I guess that would be it.
R:  [LAUGH] That's too bad.  I also have used it for, um, [LIPSMACK] for grades, um, on my own, to do an electronic grade book.
L:  [NOISE] Hm.
R:  So, that's yet another use for it.
L:  Good.
R:  I dunno.  [PAUSE] You can also, um, [LIPSMACK] sometimes in, like, life skills courses, they teach kids how --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to look in a newspaper -- hello?
L:  Yeah.  I'm here.
R:  Okay.  They teach kids how to look in the newspaper to find apartments and -- and things like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Then teach them to do that on computer as well.
L:  Mhm.  [COUGH] Do you do, um, any electronic mail stuff on your, ah, with your assignments, like, being able to put out an assignment to all the kids in class and --
R:  No.
L:  -- V slates[?].  Have you seen V slates?  You know what those are?
R:  Like a whiteboard?
L:  Ah, they're computer boards that, ah, have all the text books in 'em that you can just load -- load a textbook in and then -- then the teacher can get up in the front of the room and just, ah, through an infrared transmission, can send messages to all the kids.  They can send in their papers, they just hit send and -- and then all their, um, you know, all the things would come in, all their reports would come in.  You can just file through 'em, give 'em the grades, send them back, ah, all electronically.
R:  Well, that's pretty serious.
L:  If you wanna do, ah, homework assignments, you know, you just -- you just, instead of writing it on the board, and when they walk in, you just hit send, you've got it in your -- in your little computer slate and you just hit send and then everybody's got their homework in front of them.  It tells them what to do and -- and then they can start doing it, right there with their -- with their books.  And if they wanna write something, they write, right on that computer.  It's -- it's kinda like a [LIPSMACK] -- a, ah -- it's just like an overgrown screen that you just kinda hold and then there's, ah, keys along the bottom, [LIPSMACK] and it's just -- well, it's kinda like a laptop.  And it's just a -- a little larger laptop.  And then you can even, when you're writing in the, um, [COUGH] in the book, I mean, when you're reading the books, the textbook --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, you have whatever books you want to have, you just load 'em in.  And then, when they're reading the textbook, they can highlight, ah, they can underline, they can take out a section and put it in a note part on the side and just, you know, all kinds of things to help 'em do their studying.
R:  I haven't heard of that.
L:  It's really neat.
R:  It's serious technology there.
L:  Yeah.  Very, very neat and they're -- they're pushing it, some of the western states out here have been using it.
R:  Oh.
L:  And to -- to great advantage.  It's, um, obviously, [COUGH] ah, more expensive and so, you know, it's hard to get a school district to get started on it.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But once they make the initial investment, then it's -- it's actually less expensive if they can work out arrangements with the textbooks.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Part of the problem is the getting -- getting by the copyright problems with the textbooks because some of the publishers will allow their books to be -- to be downloaded and some of 'em won't. [LIPSMACK] And so [NOISE] if you happen to be doing, um, [NOISE] if you happen to be reading or assigning a book that's not able to be downloaded, then you have to buy the book, in addition to the, ah, in addition to the computer.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, [LIPSMACK] but, otherwise, works out very well and it's really, really nifty.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it would be in the best interests of any publisher to create an electronic version of their book.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and then sell however many licenses that they have computers and call it a day.
L:  Yep.
R:  I mean, really --
L:  But they're still trying to hang on because they're, you know, they just see so much money going out the -- out the window.
R:  It is. [LAUGH] It is but, um, if the fact is, if they have tho- -- the systems there, they're not going to go and buy textbooks that they can't use with the system that they have.
L:  That's right.
R:  They're gonna go to the publisher that's gonna give 'em what they can use with this high tech system.
L:  That's exactly true.
R:  So if the publishers are not flexible, then that's on them because other publishers are going to be.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, they're just -- they're gonna lose out on the money ei- either way.  So they can recoup a tenth of the money [LAUGH] or they can have none of it.
L:  Yep.  
R:  So.
L:  That's it.  That's the idea but they're trying to hang on for as long as they can before they go down to ten percent. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, the thing about that is, the slower you are to get in on the game, the more chance that you'll never get in on the game.  Because the tea- -- the schools tend to deal with the same publishing companies year after year --
L:  That's right.  And the sooner they get started with somebody, they'll just keep going with 'em.
R:  Yep.
L:  [COUGH] That's right. [LIPSMACK] 
R:  So.
L:  Well, that's something for you to look to.  It's the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the V slate computer with individual laptops for every kid that, um, that you can do all your English stuff with, read all their books, write all their themes, s- send them back and forth to you, do individual messaging to each kid, anything you wanna send to 'em, you just write it on your slate and send it, and --
R:  It's called the V Slate?  V as in, like, very much?
L:  Yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  Originally I thought you said B slate.
L:  No, V.  Victory.
R:  That's pretty cool.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
R:  So, where do you teach?
L:  I was at the University of Texas for quite a while and now I do part of the consulting and training and -- and, um, [inaudible] with Phi Delta Kappa.
R:  Um, no.
L:  PDK, they, um, they used to do a lot of workshops for PDK around the country and, um, so I'm just doing freelance.  I'm doing a lot of training now, I've done more curriculum design and training for, ah, prisoners.
R:  Wow.
L:  I'm working on education programs, ah, character education programs
