L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  
R:  Um, how ya doing?
L:  I'm doing good.  My name is Debbie.
R:  And I'm David.
L:  Huh.  Where ya calling from?
R:  Ah, Fort Washington.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's in New York?
R:  No, it's in -- in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- and you?
L:  I'm in Moscow, Pennsylvania.
R:  Moscow, Pennsylvania?  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, how -- how much was that?  Western Pennsylvania?
L:  No.  It's up -- it's northeast.  It's up between Wilkesberg[?], Scranton.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  In that area. 
R:  Okay.
L:  But our topic was education?
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, computers in -- in, ah, [LIPSMACK] how computers -- computers affect education.  Is that what the you -- the topic is?
R:  Right.  Have you -- have you done this before?
L:  Ah, I think once or twice.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  Have you?
R:  No.  No.  I'm --
L:  Oh, it's your first time?
R:  I'm shocked that there's a human being on the other -- the other line.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We've gotta sit here and talk for ten minutes about education.  And, ah, like, there -- the -- the sus- specifics is an -- the computer in the classroom, do we feel that it's, um, helped or hindered education.  In my opinion, I have young children, I don't know if you have children, but, ah, my daughter's using a computer in classes.  It's really helped her a -- a -- a lot in her scholastic, ah, abilities and stuff.  So, I'm -- I'm all for it.
R:  Yeah, I can't imagine where the -- where the negatives are.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
R:  This is -- this is some topic.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, yeah.  This is a little tough one.  The last one I had was, ah, about food and it was a lot easier than this.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, I +mean, I guess computers can make people lazy, I guess.  They don't -- but assuming the kids learn, you know, the multiplication tables the old way and, um, [PAUSE] you know, this is just -- the computers just enhance education.  I -- I don't see what the -- how they could possibly be a negative.
L:  Right.  I agree.  I agree a hundred percent.
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  I don't know really what else to say. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah --
R:  What happens if it doesn't last ten minutes?
L:  Ah, 'cause I think you have to have three calls to get credited for it.  So, if you don't do the ten minutes, then you don't get credit for it.
R:  And -- and what happens if you get credited?
L:  Oh, after three -- ah, three times, ah, you get -- I think they pay you ten dollars.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  I think that's how it works.
R:  And this is your second call?
L:  Yeah, but I had a -- that call I had a couple of weeks ago.  I dunno if they have to be all in one week.  I'm not really sure exactly how it works.
R:  Oh.  Well, this is -- I guess it isn't at all what I expected. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I signed up for this a long time ago.  And, ah, I -- I -- [inaudible] at the beginning I was getting, like, I had about a hundred messages on my answering machine.
R:  I know.  We did -- we did too.  I think my wife had signed up for this.  Ah, she's the -- probably the one that's supposed to be talking but I happened to answer the phone.  So.  As a -- I -- I thought I could -- I could answer a -- a computer just as well as anybody.  But, ah --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But that's used -- you get used to -- it was every half hour it would ring.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  And --
L:  I was away for the weekend and I came home and I had, like, about a hundred messages.
R:  Right.  I think they --
L:  But this was a few months ago and then I didn't hear anything.  And all of a sudden, the other day, I got a call but I didn't take it and then I got it today.
R:  Right.  I think, ah, I think they've changed the way they do this.
L:  Yes. [PAUSE] But, ah, you know, back to the computer topic [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Yeah [inaudible]. 
L:  -- if you can --
R:  I mean, I -- you know, I can also see where it would be a disadvantage for intercity kids that don't have -- don't have computers.
L:  Right.
R:  And they certainly would be at a disadvantage to the rest of the world.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, [PAUSE] but ...
L:  Even in school now, my daughter's in third grade, and, ah, basically, you -- you know, with her curriculum, I cannot -- she -- she could not function without -- out a computer.  You know, so it's really like it's a necessity for her, at this point.
R:  Well, what is it -- what exactly does she do with it?
L:  Well, she takes -- she has this ex- -- it's called accelerated reader --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where she'll read a book and it scores so many points and then she'll have to go on the computer and take the test on the computer.
R:  Really?
L:  And then it marks it automatically -- marks it and, ah, you know, gives her her points.  And, basically, like you -- you try to reach plateaus.
R:  Right.
L:  And, ah, that's all done for the computer so if she didn't -- so this is like an extra, ah, curricular activity.  It's not mandatory but if she didn't use the computer, she wouldn't be able to do it.  And, ah, you know, it's just for her own self esteem, it's -- it's a wonderful program.
R:  Well, what happens if -- if she doesn't grade well in the -- in the, ah --
L:  Really, nothing.  It's just -- it's for their own personal goals and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  It -- it's not a mandatory thing.  So, it's just, you know, helps them -- see a -- want -- encourages, you know, kids to read.
R:  So, it's sorta like a teacher's aide?
L:  Pretty much.  And then it also encourages them to use the computer and, ah, one of these benefits of, ah, getting to a certain plateau is that she was able to use the laptop in her class, as opposed to having -- going to the library to use the desktop.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  So, it was a great program.  It really, you know, ah, they were having, like, a, ah, a couple of her friends, they were, you know, having a friendly competition.
R:  Right.
L:  Which was nice.  Which also, you know, helped them, ah, you know, read more and, ah, you know, get -- get more involved in -- in the library --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so -- so that was a -- a great thing.  So, I -- I --
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  -- really enjoyed that for her.
R:  But is that all they use it for?
L:  Oh, no.  That's just one aspect of it.  That -- that they use it on their own, that's something that they have -- you know, they do it but they're not -- you know, it's not mandatory.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, it's their own initiative to go and work on these computers.  To do this particular A.R., accelerated reader.  You know, but she also uses it in her classroom so it's I -- I -- I guess it's like you said, I -- I don't see a negative in it at all.
R:  I mean, do you have a computer at home?
L:  Sure.
R:  Does she bring homework home that requires a computer?
L:  No, she -- no, they're not doing that at this point, no, they're not having, ah -- they're not, you know, ah, ah, doing their homework on a computer.  But, um, you know, she -- she has her own, well, software that she uses.
R:  Do they teach -- teach these kids the -- the software packages?
L:  I don't think so.
R:  No?
L:  I don't think so.
R:  I mean, I have -- I have a kid who just graduated college so it's a little --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's a little different than, ah, I mean, I -- I -- I guess, I mean, when he was going to school, I don't think they -- they did a whole lot with computers other --
L:  Right.
R:  -- than research and, ah, and, ah, um ...
L:  I know there's a computer room that they go to, you know, so many times a week and they do things on the computer up there.  They don't have one at their, you know, at their desk.  I don't that happens until she gets into the higher grades.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How -- how big a school district is it?
L:  Oh, it's one of the -- it -- it is the top school district in this northeast area that I'm in.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Um, as to how many students, I really don't know.
R:  But the other school districts have computers, or this is -- or it's just ...?
L:  I would assume so.  I would -- I would assume so but, ah, ah, I don't know anybody else in the -- in the other di- -- I'm not originally from up here so [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  I don't really know anybody else in different districts.
R:  You sorta have a sounding like -- like -- like you have a New York accent?
L:  That's right.  I'm originally from New York.
R:  Oh, are you really? [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, that's not -- it's not far to Moscow then, I guess.
L:  Oh, about two hours and fifteen minutes.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, it -- it's -- I'm so used to it now, it's no big deal.
R:  Are your family still in New York?
L:  Yes.  Even my husband's family also, they're all in New York.
R:  So they have --
L:  We're the only ones up here.
R:  So, was it because of the computers and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- apply it back to the same topic.  I mean, what's -- what triggered it to Moscow in Pennsylvania?
L:  I had -- we had had a summer home in the area and, um, we decided to sell it and buy a house and try moving up here permanently.  We've been up here eleven years, it's not that we're, you know, that new to the area. 
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, and that's what we did.  We figured that if it didn't work out, you know, you -- we could always go back.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, we stayed and we ended up having a family and, you know, settling down, having -- putting down some roots.
R:  Oh, well, you moved -- you moved before you got married?  That's -- I mean before you had kids?
L:  Yes.
R:  That's amazing.
L:  Yes.
R:  That's, ah --
L:  We were pretty young when we moved up here.
R:  So, then you weren't looking at a school district to see, ah --
L:  Excuse me?
R:  You weren't in the school?
L:  Yes, I was.  
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Because that -- that was one of the things with moving up here, is that we wanted to start a family.  
R:  Right.
L:  So, it was very important, you know, what -- what school district we were in.  So, we're in the North Pocano School District so I wanted to stay, you know, where -- where, you know, I knew that-- though -- she -- at least my kids will be getting a decent education.
R:  Well, I guess in -- in -- I mean, were you in the City?
L:  Ah, Brooklyn.
R:  Okay.  So, then -- so there's a place you may not get computers in class, right?
L:  I -- I honestly don't know.  I really don't know.  Most -- most of my family lives in Jersey.  So, who -- you know, my cousins that have kids and out in Jersey, it's like the same thing up here with the computers and, you know, they have computers in school.  As for in Brooklyn, I really don't know. 
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I can't answer that [LAUGH] -- that question.
R:  [LAUGH] This is really bizarre. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, that's what happens.  You start running out of things to say.  You know [LAUGH]. 
R:  Is that what happens?  I mean, do -- when your ten minutes are up, does a bell ring or something?
L:  Yeah, there's something like a -- a -- a -- a tone that you hear.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And it tells you that it's up.
R:  Oh.
L:  And that -- that  -- that's it.  
R:  But how do they know what -- I mean, was everybody -- I don't even know anything about this.  I mean, was everybody -- everybody get paid regardless of whether the conversation was --
L:  I have -- I don't know.  I've never gotten paid so I don't know.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, there's -- this a lot of work for ten bucks, to do this three times.
L:  Yeah, like I say, I don't know if it's three times -- I thought it was three times in one week.  Maybe  it's not, maybe it's just three times, you know, when you reach three times, you get paid for it.  I really don't know.  
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  I'd have to go on the w- -- I don't -- I don't even remember what the website was for this.
R:  Well, hopefully they're not going to ask for, ah -- it's probably some kinda code -- well, there used to be a code you had to give to them.
L:  Right.  
R:  Maybe they're testing to see whether the -- the parents need more computer, ah, literacy.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I -- I dunno, ah, how's the weather?
L:  Has your -- your wife has ever -- has she ever done this or ...?
R:  No.  She was the one that signed up for it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But this -- this is actually my office phone and so I answered it.  And I, you know, I -- I -- like I said --
