L:  Hi, I'm David.
R:  Hi, I'm Vanessa.
L:  Well, I think a- -- I think computers can enhance education quite a lot.  Ah there's just so many different programs that are available to help people, but I think they need to be used in ah -- in a responsible way because I know that when I went to school a lot -- we had computers and they were supposed to be used for education purposes, but most of the times we just used them for games and stuff.
R:  Mm.  Well, when I went to school they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we didn't have 'em around so I don't know like maybe kids kind of forget how to actually study and -- and look up things, you know, I -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  I think --
L:  I- -- it's just very easy to look up things on the computer and not even have to venture out to the library and so I -- I know there's a big problem with plagiarism, especially on the Internet --
R:  Yeah, I suppose.
L:  -- so I think it just needs to be taught responsibly.  I think it's important that children know how to use computers, but --
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  They -- they definitely need to learn how to use them.
L:  I think it's also important that they -- but they also know how to go to the library; like you were saying before, and that they don't -- that they don't rely a hundred percent on a computer, that they don't use it as a crutch.
R:  Yeah, I think kids can get too wrapped up in it, besides using it for school.  I mean, it's -- you know, they're -- most of the kids I know use them for video games and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  They're not really very educational when you use them that way.  But --
L:  Do you think that your education would have been enhanced by using computers?
R:  Huh.  It probably would have made it more interesting.
L:  It does have the potential to be interesting.  But I also think that, you know, it's not very -- even today, computers aren't very widespread, I mean you might have some computers in the library, but in the classroom, I -- I doubt that there's that many computers out there.  I could be wrong, but --
R:  Yeah, I know.  I don't -- I don't have kids, so I don't know exactly what's going on in schools, but yeah I know they weren't anywhere near using them when I was going to school, but I think, yeah, it would have -- I could see how they would hold a kid's interest, maybe --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but I also think it's important for kids to, you know, develop a love for reading and -- and I don't know if you're going to get that through a computer.
L:  That's true.  I know a lot of people -- a lot of kids especially they -- instead of reading, they play a lot more video games than -- than really they should and that's -- I think that's the major drawback to using -- to having computers in an educational environment.  But um I just think as long as there's supervision, I think a lot of people just believe that you know just pop the kid in front of the computer and let the computer do the work, but I think that still the teachers have the responsibility to -- to supervise and to -- to instruct their children how to use the computer in a proper way and as well as parents to get -- to channel children's interests towards the more educational things as opposed to the more dangerous things on computers or -- or the less educational things, like video games.
R:  Yeah and sometimes ah you know, you have to know that you're -- the parents --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the teachers know how to use the computer as well as the kids do, some of them are --
L:  Actually, that's an important part of um -- I guess they need to -- they need to educate especially teachers how to -- how -- what are effective ways of -- of learning on a computer because a lot of teachers that -- when they went to school there probably weren't that many computers around and um and that -- and now that you know they don't -- they're not really sure how to teach using computers and the- -- they don't know everything that's available to you then.
R:  Yeah, it's a whole different ballgame nowadays.  But [MN] yeah, I think I definitely I would have been probably more interested in school and I was just thinking about this today, I saw a commercial for um [SIGH] a program that's you know it's like a whole set of encyclopedias on one CD program and I remember working for a place that -- one of these companies that sold --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sets of encyclopedias and I thought, "God, you know, people wouldn't even waste their time buying a whole set now because they take up so much room and you know, you can have everything on a few CDs" --
L:  That's very true.
R:  -- and have -- available to look up anytime you want and not have to drag out books and stuff, but ah --
L:  Yeah, I -- I don't -- I don't think I know anybody who really has um -- I mean, except for some older people I know but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who doesn't -- who has a full set of encyclopedias.  It must be e- -- it used to be much more popular but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] --
R:  And plus -- you know, they're --
L:  The only encyclopedias that I really know are in the library.
R:  Yeah.  And then you know they'd have to be updated every few years or so [MN] because anybody who has them in their house, they're probably out of date anyway.
L:  It's true.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  So, I guess the computer [MN] the computer also allows people to be much more up to date on things and to um -- and to keep people, you know, on the cutting edge of technology and on information as well.  That's definitely a positive thing.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Associated with computers [MN] but I grew up with -- like I -- I mean in school we had computers, but I don't really think it affected me that much because they just weren't -- like there were computers in the library, but we didn't have computers in the classroom and we had computer class --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but it was just a glorified like typewriting class.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, I don't think that really computers affected me in any real positive way be- -- and like we're saying before, [MN] I think it's because one, teachers didn't know -- really know how to teach with computers and also it's just with -- having computers in the -- in the classroom for everybody's just so expensive.  [inaudible] schools don't have that much money.  They don't have enough money even to hire teachers, so how are they supposed to [NOISE] --
R:  H- -- Yeah.
L:  -- spend all the money to buy for the st- -- buy state of the art computers and -- and send teachers to these trainings.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  They would have to be --
L:  Yeah, so --
R:  -- going to training and constantly updating their knowledge.
L:  And it's -- it's hard for schools that are cash -- cash strapped, so I guess they just rely on traditional methods, which isn't bad but I think it's a shame that they don't utilize all this technology and all these programs they have out there.  I know there's spec- -- there's a lot especially for younger kids, like preschool age and [MN] maybe kindergarten or first grade that really doesn't get to many people because it's not affordable to them.
R:  Yeah.  Whenever I hear about computers in school, I always think of it with younger kids, like they're starting them out really young using it, you know I'm not even sure for the schools that do have computers in their classrooms, you know, how early do they start, but I guess I always kind of -- when I'm seeing, you know, news stories about it or something they always show, you know, six, seven, eight year olds or something.
L:  Yeah.  It's important to teach them when they're younger so they you know I think kids younger can absorb a lot more.  But um I think older kids mainly use it for, like research tools and it -- it is instead of going to the library or to -- or when they're doing a book report or something, it's so much easier to go online, you know, in your own home or at -- at school than having to go all the way to the library.  And a lot of kids now that -- you know, they don't how to -- know how to look, read um, excuse me, look up books and things like that like basic things that people you know a little older than or my parents' generation would, you know, know how to do very well and just [MN] people my age or younger would probably be lost like using a card catalogue or something like that.
R:  Yeah.  I think that's -- that has been lost a lot because --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, you see kids in the library sometimes but ah maybe younger kids because they have, you know, story time or something but ah I don't -- you know, I just think people have lost interest in books.  I know a lot of adults even older than I am that ah that don't read for pleasure at all and -- and I -- I don't know that kids would develop that if they're constantly using a computer --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just not the same.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I- -- I mean, I don't think kids have ah such a big interest in books but now even -- even less of an interest --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than they used to have.  Especially now.  To use -- like especially they -- if they -- kids want to exercise their imagination, all they have to do is, you know, turn on a video game instead of, you know, getting engrossed in a book or something like that.
R:  I know and -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's a shame.  I -- I like it when parents, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- tell me that their -- their kid's into reading because that's so important for education.  You know it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I was always really good with reading and english and spelling and all that, but horrible with math and you know I always had my head stuck in a book when I was a kid --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't know.  I just, you know, kids are basically so TV oriented now that you know, I don't know, I don't know if it's -- they'll be learning the same way ...
L:  Mhm.  A lot of people I think --
R:  -- without --
L:  -- worry about that.  There's -- there's so many distractions, TV, computers and ah you know, all sorts of -- there's like Nintendo and Playstation and Gameboy and -- and TV and Cable and Satellite and all these videos.
R:  Yeah.  I don't ... yeah, I don't think it's very healthy for kids to, you know, most parents, the only peace they get is when they plunk their kids in front of a television and you know stick in a video or something.
L:  They use it as a babysitter.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And --
L:  And maybe that's --
R:  -- it's like, well --
L:  I think may -- maybe some parents see that as they don't have the time to really spend as much time with their children as they'd like to so they use computers as a way to educate them to -- you know, try to steer them in the right direction.  Maybe they buy them some educational software or something like that.  But it just becomes like another TV and it doesn't really get the effect
