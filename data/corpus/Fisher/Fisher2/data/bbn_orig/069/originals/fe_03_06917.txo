L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  How are you?
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm fine.  My name's Angie.
R:  Hi, my name is Joyce.
L:  Okay.  Well, I live in Georgia.  Where are you from?
R:  No, my name is Joyce.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Oh, so where do you live?
R:  In Ohio.  
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Um, we're from Georgia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]  Um, I -- I don't know, Kor- -- North Korea makes me nervous, a little bit, um [LIPSMACK] but ah ah as far as like countries, ah, other countries, I don't -- I don't really have a fear of um too many other countries.
R:  Um, no, I don't either.  I don't have a fear of any country and as far as North Korea's concerned, um, I really think that they can work it out.  I don't really think it's a f- -- a -- a -- fear factor, yet.
L:  Yeah, me either, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it's -- it can be worked out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I wish that um -- I don't -- I don't know, I really feel that we help so many other countries and we send food and clothing and all kind of stuff to other countries to help people, that I don't see how -- how they could like be against us, or --
R:  Oh, North Korea, you mean?
L:  Well, any of -- any country, actually.
R:  Oh, I um --
L:  Because I know that we sent, um, you know, a lot of food and stuff over to Iraq and Afghanistan and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they were still against America and so that sort of confused me when we try to help 'em, but um, I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  Um, well I don't think that it's the -- it's necessarily for example for the country of Iraq and Iran, it's not really the people themselves --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just happens to be that you have bad people in power --
L:  Well, that's true, that's true.
R:  -- so you can send ah -- you can go according to the United Nations with the different aid ah programs that we have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah like UNICEF, the World Organizations and send food and donations, but only so much of it really gets to those particular type of countries --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you have to think about who's in power.  And who's running the country.
L:  Well, that -- that's true.
R:  And if the people are -- are -- are not educated, you know --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and they don't have ah freedom of speech and free press to really know what's going on outside of their country --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you know, they're stuck like living in a -- a vacuum.
L:  Well, that's true.  And I guess they just hear what the people in charge there tell them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like about us.  So --
R:  Yeah, and that's what they --
L:  -- they don't have much to base it on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless they have satellite --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- and then they can -- can see what the rest of the world is doing --
L:  Mhm.  That's true.
R:  -- but when you look at how the people are living, they live ah -- I wouldn't even say it's third world, they live like you know, back in the -- the Middle Ages.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  And it's --
R:  As far as being modern.
L:  Right.  And that's sad, to me [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  With as much technology and things that are available today, it's sad that some of those women still have to cover their faces and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wear the veils and --
R:  Yeah, so it's -- it's just the government --
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  -- I'm quite sure that if the people were given ah a proper government and opportunities ah economic opportunities and ah -- and trade opportunities, I think that the people would be a little bit better, you know, the countries would improve.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, but --
L:  Well, that makes a lot of sense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I think there's like a lot of things in the United States though I believe that we have so many homeless people and um you know, there's so much racism going on, I just think there are things that we need to work on here, not -- I'm not saying not help other countries, but I think we need to help ourselves a little bit.  I think we sometimes help other countries more than we do for our own [LAUGH].
R:  Yes, that's -- that's true, too.  You know, ah America does need a lot of improvement as far as --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- healthcare --
L:  Right.
R:  -- homeless, um, and different neighborhoods --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or cities and towns.  They need a lot of help too to ah to get them running --
L:  They do.
R:  -- and to make them a little bit more stable.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  And I wish some of the [NOISE] --
R:  But America's not perfect.
L:  No, that's true, that's true.
R:  You know?  It's -- it's -- 
L:  And I guess sometimes ah sometimes I tend to think it is, I know it's not, but sometimes I tend to think that we're invincible, or that we're perfect when we're really not, but --
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- America's not perfect, but then you look at what's happening in America and then you have to look at the g- -- the plant itself and it as a big picture since we are the only super power --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah we do have to work like Big Brother.  You -- we have to take care of those without --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it happens to be countries that are even below our standards --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is what we consider poverty here is not poverty over there, that's like living large.
L:  Mhm.  Right.  Right.
R:  You know, so --
L:  And that's sad.
R:  -- you got to look at it like that, too.  Who's --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- poor here and who's doing without, they're rich or doing well --
L:  Well, that's true --
R:  -- according to different countries.
L:  -- compared with that -- that's true.  That is true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially when you don't even have running water.
L:  I know, that's awful.  I don't know how people --
R:  Yeah, no electricity.
L:  -- I don't know how they do it, I really don't.  Ooh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, they are living like way back in the Middle Ages.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.  They do.  But I don't really um sometimes you know well in the past I guess Russia has made me uneasy before but um I don't know, I think our relations are really good with them right now and I know that they were sort of mad at us for going to war, but I think that hopefully everything can be worked out.
R:  Ah, well, I could understand Russia, I don't think Russia was really mad at us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a- at the -- at America for going to war with um Iraq.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think the problem was that Russia did all it could to not get involved --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- because Russia had done so much damage to that country.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Think of it, every arms that those people have, from the +weaponry --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to the rockets --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to the tanks, those are all Russian.
L:  That's true.
R:  That was left behind from Russia.  So, if Russia did all this dirt, you know, trying to make the dollar bill for this country --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then how can you participate, how can you send your soldiers into a country --
L:  Well, that's true.
R:  -- when I gave you the weapons?
L:  That's true.  And --
R:  So, you have to -- I had to look at it like that.  So --
L:  Yeah.  And I'm sure they didn't want the United States to really know how much [LAUGH] they had over there or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, how much they had actually helped, or whatever.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  So --
R:  -- you got to look at that side too.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  At least I did.
L:  [LAUGH] Ah, now, that's true.  That's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you been -- have you traveled to any foreign countries?
R:  Yes.
L:  I haven't.  I would love, but I have toured a lot of the United States --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I've never um gone overseas.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I would love to go to like Paris or Germany or um I used to work at the University of Georgia and we had a lot of um foreign students --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in our program and um a lot of them were from Germany and France and um Spain and they just -- they had the best recipes and they were just so fond of listening to um -- um to learn about their culture and I would love to travel over there sometime.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I spent a -- a lot of time like ah going to -- to Asian countries.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I've been to Japan --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- to Taiwan.  I lived in the Philippines for a while.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have family there, or are you just um --
R:  No.
L:  -- travelled?  Okay.
R:  My -- no, my father was in the air force.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Well, that's interesting.
R:  -- we traveled a lot.
L:  Well good.  Like do you have a stories to tell your children and grandchildren? [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.
L:  That's great.  That is great.
R:  Yeah, but as I got older I still traveled to different, the countries that I really like.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  And ah right now the only thing that I -- place that I would like to travel to is I would like to go to ah -- to Ecuador, to Peru --
L:  Oh, that'd be nice.
R:  -- and ah -- and maybe to Mexico.
L:  Well, yeah, that would be nice.
R:  Yeah, but I've been to --
L:  Those would be beautiful.
R:  -- the Caribbean and all those places like that, so --
L:  I hear they're beautiful --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like the Cayman Islands and all those are pretty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That sounds really nice [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  But I like going places for the culture and not just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- beaches and -- yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  And um, the food, that's pretty interesting to me, too.  Some of the things that they eat and how they cook and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, and their languages are so beautiful.  I wish um -- sometimes I wish I knew more than one language, but I know a little Spanish, but that's about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, do you know another language?
R:  Ah, a little bit of Spanish.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  That's about it --
L:  Um --
R:  -- just ah -- ah -- a couple of phrases in Japanese --
L:  Mhm.  That's neat.  That's really neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, good.  Well, that sounds wonderful.  So, what part of Ohio are you from?
R:  Columbus.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, I'm not from Columbus, Ohio.  I live in Columbus, Ohio.
L:  Oh, okay.  We have a friend that um lives in Canton so --
R:  Oh, I know where that's at.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I saw that on the map.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Canton, Ohio.  That's up by Cleveland, I think.
L:  Mhm.  It is.  It is.
R:  Yeah.  When I went to Cleveland ah a couple of months a
