R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Carrie.
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Selina.
L:  So, what's the question again?  Do we think that there's any other threat -- or what countries are threat to the American people?
R:  Um, I guess --
L:  Did I hear that right?
R:  Yeah, that -- yeah, that was the question.  Yeah.
L:  So, what do you think?
R:  Um, I don't know, I think the biggest threat to the United States is itself [LAUGH].
L:  That's what I was going to say, actually [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was hoping I was going to talk to somebody who'd be like, "Actually" and start enumerating all these different countries that are threats so I could get in a big argument.  But, no, I think that we're -- we're our own biggest threat to ourselves.
R:  M- -- no, I -- I totally agree.  I believe it.  Where are you from?
L:  From Florida, right now living in Brooklyn.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Um, right now I'm living in DC.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  Mhm.  [NOISE] And so why do you -- why do you think the United States is the biggest -- is the biggest threat to itself?
L:  Oh, I think that our government's a bunch of, you know, white bullies, you know, white man bullies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that don't have a fucking clue.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I just -- I mean, I just really think that they're extraordinarily greedy, ignorant, um, hateful, racist, just about anything that's bad about a human being that's, you know, that we're -- I mean, we're going to kill each other off because of these greedy son of a bitches.  That's my opinion.  I'm pretty angry --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- at Bush.  I mean, I'm living in like middle class squalor or you know middle -- what is it?  They call it middle class poverty and I can't get health insurance.  My parents --
R:  Me either, too.
L:  -- are middle class.  But I'm basically like slumming because, because you know the economy's so bad, you know, that I can't even wash dishes for somebody to get a job, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like the economy's so bad and there's just so many bad things going on right now that I mean I just -- it's hard for me to not have hatred for Bush and his -- and his people.  Just hard, because my mom's a Buddhist, so she -- she's like, "Well, we don't hate anybody", but I just hate him.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  Well, okay.  Okay.
L:  So, what do you think?
R:  Um, I mean, I guess with the current state of affairs it's kind of -- it -- it's kind of um, I don't know, not obvious, but it -- it just seems that c- -- like states and -- and people around the world are kind of fed up with um the United States ah kind of bullying co- -- whatever, bullying methods.
L:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
R:  Um, and so like unless the people here actually resist the government, then everybody is going to end up worse off so -- but I think people are pretty disillusioned and pretty like, pretty um, what do you call it?  They don't think that they can do much, you know --
L:  Yeah, there's the --
R:  -- which is funny 'cause --
L:  -- there's a kind of apathy that -- that's grown.  I mean, the protests were I guess the biggest protest in like the history of -- of like the world, you know, more people came out to protest the war and then after that, after all those people came out, I think they're like, "All right, that did nothing, what can I do?" you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then some people do civil disobedience, they get arrested, they go home, then they say, "Now what?  What can I do?  What's the point?" --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So, I think that that -- that's very disillusioning in war, it's like where -- it's how do we -- how do we become activists?  Well, people don't realize that they can be activists in a way that they consume our culture --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just, you know, what they buy and you know what -- what industries they support --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that in itself, like that's a kind of decision making that is as important as anything else.  So, I mean I try to -- I try to you know do things in that regard, but otherwise it's like it's true, how do you -- how do you rise up against, you know, a government that, no, is -- is the world bully?
R:  Mm, I -- I guess it'll be really interesting to see how elections play out, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how like ah -- I mean, 'cause most people I speak to say that George Bush is going to win --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I- -- most people I speak to say that they think George Bush is going to win, but at the same time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they -- they still feel like it's important to vote and to still it, you know?
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Like, do things.  And so, I'm wondering, how does that play out?  Like, if you already think that you're -- this person is going to win and take over the government, then how does that -- like what k- -- like what is the point of your resistance, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because the -- if the goal is to -- if the goal is to win or maybe the goal isn't to win, maybe the goal is to just build a mass movement so that people can recognize that the voting system just doesn't work and that there needs to be a -- a rebellion against the government, you know, that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- out -- out [inaudible] going.  So, I'm not sure how that -- because, I mean like last year, I mean, last election people would probably disagree that he's the right presi- -- like that he was actually rightfully elected, so --
L:  Right.  I know, I know.  I don't think that even the people know how -- how wrongly he was elected and how much or what was involved in him making sure that he would win in the end.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  That's just so depressing.  I --
R:  What do you think of the -- w- w- --
L:  What's that?
R:  Well, what do you think about how like the media's um like how they're -- their coverage of stuff?
L:  Oh, it's totally awful and depressing.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  I- I mean really this has been without a doubt the most horrible and depressing period of my life.  I've been deeply influenced by the goings on and maybe it's because I just graduated college and I kind of came out of the alienation of the liberal arts experience, which is supposed to be so in tune with you know what's happening in the world when really I just felt kind of secluded from -- from a lot of things so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, upon exiting that I think that I was hit with the whirlwind of reality, um --
R:  Can I just say agree with you, yeah.  I agree.
L:  -- so, you know what I mean?  It's kind of like, all right, now I've gotta get a job and have a life and being personally affected by, you know, by the economy and seeing my friends affected by it and people I care about affected by it, not just the economy, but other things, you know, um that are -- that are happening with our own rights and [MN] all this crap, I mean it is just utterly depressing.  And I think that the worst thing is seeing other people, you know, in my neighborhood that are trying -- that have families and are trying to make it, all they can think about is how they're going to get their next bill paid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they don't have time to be reading the newspaper every day, keeping in touch with politics, learning what's, you know, reading the paper online from other countries and knowing what's going on.  It's like, "How do I get up in the morning and feed my children?", you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So, it's like even though the two are so completely interconnected --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, Bush and his people keep us in a position where all you can think about is your immediate circumstance --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even though your immediate circumstance --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is so deeply impacted by what's happening on a daily basis in our government.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  Well, I -- yeah --
L:  It's just -- it's exhausting.
R:  It -- it is -- I definitely agree with you about it being very exhausting to be dealing with all of these like [NOISE] issues when there's so much other stuff that you're thinking about like health care [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  No kidding.
R:  Yeah, I know that's like --
L:  I mean y- -- you must be right in it in -- in -- in the DC area, I mean if you --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Do -- do you --
R:  Oh, I'm in the belly of the beast, I don't know [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  What's that?
R:  Yeah, the belly of the beast --
L:  You're in the belly of the beast, right.
R:  -- as we like to ca- -- yeah, or the -- or the --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't know what you would call it, but yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's um, I don't know, it's interesting.  It's kind of a -- DC's kind of a place, I mean I don't know if you've been here.
L:  I have.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  My girlfriend's from there.
R:  Okay, you're girlfriends from -- okay.  Um --
L:  She's from Tacoma Park, Maryland, actually.  So, just -- just north of DC.  Not -- not directly --
R:  No, but what kind of -- what -- ah -- what kind of work does she do?
L:  Well, she's a student still.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, um, she's a writer and actually she just was -- she's in -- she's in Switzerland today protesting the um --
R:  Oh, she is?  The G Eight Summit?
L:  She's for -- yeah, she's p- -- she's protesting the G Eight, or I guess now she's probably sleeping, I don't know the time difference, but um -- but that's where she was all day, protesting.  She's pretty intense about that kind of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that be- -- what's that?
R:  Oh no, go ahead.
L:  I was just going to say that growing up in the DC, I think that that had a huge impact on her, her high school and being involved in journalism and politics, um, being in the belly --
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  -- of the beast.
R:  I mean, like I know definitely like I mean I um I interned for the National [inaudible] Journalist Association, which is pretty like a --
L:  The National what?
R:  Gay and Lesbian Journalist Association.
L:  Oh, no way.  That's what she did too.
R:  Oh, she did?  What's her name?
L:  Yeah.  She -- actually, she got a scholarship through them, through being a gay journalist and that's how she got to go to -- go to college.
R:  Oh, seriously?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Look into their scholarships.
R:  Wow.  Well, I guess, okay, that's funny.  Did she go to LA for the program?  I mean, I guess it wasn't in LA.  Did she do like the summer program or the September program?
L:  No, she didn't.
R:  Like, oh, okay.  Okay.  That's pretty cool.
L:  That's pretty funny, right?
R:  Yeah, that is pretty funny.  Yeah, um, what was I saying?  Yeah, so it's kinda -- I mean, 'cause like the -- DC's kind of like a -- a city full of contradictions, I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And um it's like -- it's like, you know, people that live here are just -- are um disenfranchised and like they don't have their own r- -- I mean they don't have their own representatives at all and like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this is like, you -- this is like one of the poorest, you know, some of -- some of the parts of the city are one of the poorest parts of the country, has the number one murder rate in the [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- the co- -- um, it has you know homelessness is rising incredibly, more than the eighties, um --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- people are being unemployed left and right, unemployment is high --
L:  So -- so high.
R:  -- just
