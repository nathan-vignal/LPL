L:  Oh, hello.
R:  Hi, this is -- hi, this is Tim.
L:  Oh, hi.  My name's Laura.
R:  Hi, Laura.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Good.  Good.  Well, ah, my first, ah, opinion on this is that, ah, I think computers in school do help education.  I think it's the way -- way of the future.  Um, you know, kids nowadays learn more by the time they're in, you know, fifth grade than, ah, I probably ever learnt.  Ah, you know, whether with computers in high school or in school period.  And, ah, I think with, ah, most businesses and -- and people being trained in computers so it's only going to help them to be more proficient in their jobs in their future.
L:  Um, I absolutely agree.  [LAUGH] It's, um, I'm actually putting groceries away right now, too.
R:  No, great.  I'm just eating something, so go ahead.
L:  [LAUGH] This will just take me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a -- one more second.  I'm just putting the -- the things that need to be refrigerated away.  Um, I agree.  Um, because, let me see now, every era has its things, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Machinery or whatever.  And computers certainly are the machinery, or whatever, of this era.  And, um, it is necessary --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think what [NOISE] I've observed from my nephews and my niece, their so -- children are so [LIPSMACK] adept at learning.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  They're like little learning machines.
R:  Oh, sure.  Sure.  
L:  So --
R:  Yeah, they're -- and it's -- it's very true.  I mean, you know, I mean, ah, I look at, ah, you know, the moldability of kids and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it just it -- it goes to show that, I think, the younger you are and the more that is given to you, the more you can adapt.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the more you can take in and retain.  And I think, ah, that's only going to benefit kids and, you know, in the future.  And hopefully, ah, you know, hopefully, I think in any -- in any situation, there are -- there's a good side and there's a bad side.  And -- and hopefully that they'll -- they'll be able to take -- take whatever they learn and use it for good.  You know, instead of bad because, you -- you know, you see nowadays all these kids, ah, they want to use a lot of the information technology that they've learned for, you know, maybe disruptive things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How many things in the government where people, ah, ah, you know, people who work long and hard and they try to crack these codes and get into the Pentagon and just because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's a challenge --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- to them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and I think you can only be, you know, if they can -- if they can focus their energies on -- on -- on things that are good versus things that are bad, that's where, ah, you know, that's where we're going to all benefit.  You know, and they'll help us, you know, help everybody in the future.
L:  I, ah, totally agree.  I'm -- I'm very happy to find that there's a, um, um, a person, a, um, and I, ah, you being one person has me knowing, of course, that you're just indicative of other people being out there, who's actually concerned about good or bad.  Concerned about --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, the pop- -- the population --
R:  Well, believe me, I mean --
L:  -- and which direction they're going in.
R:  -- that's why -- that's why my wife works out of our house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know what I mean?  I mean, we could have two incomes if we -- you know, if we wanted and she's a very, you know, brilliant person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we could, you know, we could h- have those things but, you know what?  She chooses to stay home and she works her schedule around, ah, office hours, around our kids. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and, you know, she's there for them for all their, ah, ah, things at school.  And for all the things that, you know, that they need and you know what?  Like I said, we, you know, we could have two incomes and have a bigger house and have this, that and the other thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we choose to focus on our kids because, you know, when we leave, that's what the focus of our whole life should have been.  It should have been able to produce, you know, two good kids that will be productive in our society.
L:  Wh- -- uh-huh.
R:  And -- and they'll be able to, hopefully, you know, with these advancements, be able to --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- be more technologically advanced.  And hopefully, you know, help somebody else down the f- -- you know, down the road.
L:  Yes.  Yes. 
R:  And that's what we focus on.  You know, and -- and that's how we -- that's how we view it.
L:  Boy.  That just put me in a good mood.  
R:  Well [LAUGH]. 
L:  Really. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, it's not, you know, it's not -- it's my wife that does it all.
L:  Mhm.
R:  She has the burden.  You know, she's the bur- -- she has the burden.  She -- she is absolutely wonderful and she takes care of these kids and makes them all of what they are.  And that they would not be, you know, the good students that they are and the -- the good -- everybody wants to have -- I'm not trying to, you know, ah, over state this, but I mean, everybody loves our kids, you know, because they come from a stable background, you know?  And -- and I think, you know, being able to put kids into the future in a good situation is only going to be more productive for us.  You know, it's only going to help future generations.
L:  I celebrate, yeah.
R:  And that's what -- and that's wh- -- you know, and that's what we're trying to do.  You know, and I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- computers in the school is -- is one thing that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, you know, we'll be able to, hopefully, you know, if -- and they can teach us things too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean, I'm not -- I'm not a great computer mind by any stretch of the imagination but these--
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- kids will be.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they'll be able to do a lot more things than -- than, ah, than I've every dreamed of.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, hopefully, through, um, you know, through school and through, you know, positive reinforcement, they'll be able to, you know, take that up -- you know, take that challenge on and help other people.  So ...
L:  Well, yeah.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm so happy to hear a -- again, that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, there are at least two, I -- I know --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- there's many but --
R:  Sure.  My wife and I are --
L:  -- you know --
R:  -- you know, are like that.  But, there's you know --
L:  -- non frivolous thinking people.
R:  -- and I think that's what the fiber of America is about.
L:  That's so cool.
R:  You know, I think that's really what it is.  You know, where do you live?
L:  Oh, um, well, I sorta live in Massachusetts but I'm going to school currently in New Jersey --
R:  Okay, yeah.
L:  -- so I sorta live in New Jersey.
R:  We live in Wisconsin.  Right outside of Milwaukee.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, that's where -- that's where we are.
L:  But I lived in [NOISE] California for, like, the last eighteen years.
R:  Okay.
L:  I've been living back here for three that's [several inaudible words] I've only been back here for three winters.
R:  Sure.  Sure.  
L:  Um --
R:  Well, you know, I mean, what have you noticed otherwise?  See, I -- my whole life has been here.  
L:  Mm.  
R:  You know, I mean, I've never --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I've never had an experience outside of the community that I -- that I'm in.  And -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, you know, maybe it be midwestern or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I mean, I think a lot of the values and a lot of the kids that we try to focus our family on, you know, and the families that -- that we focus on, are -- are that way.  You know, they want --
L:  Wow.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- their kids to be -- they want to succeed but, you know what?  They wanna, you know, they wanna take the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and be able to know that, ah, they're doing the right things for their kids and -- and I think that's where, you know, a lot of times, you know, we focus so much more on school and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- their attention.
L:  I think that -- that -- that's really, really great.  Um, I don't have children, on purpose.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, that was something, too big a job for me.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, and, um --
R:  Well, no, that's fine.
L:  Thank you, [LAUGH] really.
R:  Yeah, that's fine.  That's awesome.
L:  'Cause I know I'm pretty much in the minority.
R:  No, don't feel that way.
L:  Ah.
R:  You know --
L:  Thank you.
R:  -- because it's what -- it's -- you know what?  You're helping other people in other ways I bet.  I would only imagine?
L:  Well --
R:  It's by the way you talk and by the way that, you know, by the way you have concerns for --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, for the greater humanity.
L:  I'm, um --
R:  You know, I'm sure you're o- -- people in other ways.
L:  Thank you.  Thank you, and I think you're right about that.  It's interesting --
R:  Yo.
L:  -- that you picked something up about me.  Right now, I'm -- I'm actually, I'm training in -- in health care.  I was --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, fifteen years working with health care, for papers --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and now I'm switching over to patient care.  I'm tra- -- I'm training to be a sys- sonographer.  You know, ultra sound?
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah.  See, well, my wife works for a hospital.
L:  Ah.
R:  She does all the policies for a hospital.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  And she's in charge of all the, you know--
L:  Okay.
R:  -- there's fifteen hundred policies, I think, and, ah, about two thousand policies and she's in charge of all their joint commission stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Everything the joint commission comes, that's who they turn to.  And she's a brilliant person.  But, you know what?  Like I said, she's been offered more pay and different jobs but we chose that this is the route that we need to take because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that's what's most important for, you know, for our future -- our future in general, period.  So --
L:  Mm.  Now, um, the thing -- the thing about computers, I hope we still have time because --
R:  Sure.
L:  I wanted to say that I've been so disillusioned by what people have done with the computer.  
R:  Well, oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, the contents.  The subjects they get into.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, sure.
L:  You know, and that stuff comes across too easily to anybody.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, myself, I don't get into any weird stuff at all.  
R:  Well --
L:  And, you know, I've gotten these things, ah, like, unsolicited things.
R:  Oh, absolutely.  
L:  That's poisoning our children.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  It's -- it's just a temptation for 'em, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah and -- and it's creepy.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  I mean, it's not even happy stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, the stuff that came --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh, to me, like, last week, was -- it was creepy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not that I really even looked, but it was --
R:  No.
L:  -- not happy stuff. 
R:  No.  No.  But, you know what?  It grabs your attention.  It -- it can't help but grab your attention.  You're like--
L:  Yeah, will --
R:  -- "Oh, my god, what's that?"
L:  I would think.  Yes.  
R:  You know.
L:  Actually and -- and it was a trick.  It was a trick.
R:  Sure. 
L:  It came through --
R:  Yeah, oh --
L:  -- an email and it -- it was around Mother's Day and it said, "Mom".
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  Okay.  Well --
R:  Oh, sheesh.
L:  -- it wasn't mom stuff at all.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so, my main gripe is that, like, say in a library, the librarians are too -- too concerned about freedom of whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think America is a little too concerned with don't -- don't, um -- censorship.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think self -- self censorship would be the way to go.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like you, you know, you can't go to a library and get a real creepy book.  They don't have 'em.
R:  No.  Crikes.
L:  But yet they say, "Well, anything that comes on the Internet" and I think that's doing the opposite of what you and your wife and the people you know, who think like you, are trying to do.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, true.
L:  So --
R:  It does -- it does -- it does take you a peg down.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's why you have to work all the harder.  
L:  I love that.
R:  And that's what we do.
L:  Well, a -- a -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm in such a good mood now.
R:  You know.  Because it's self reliant.  It's self reliant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, that's how this country was built.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's -- it's not one -- what people can give you.  It's what you can get the most out of your life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And who you can share it with.  And that's, you know, on, ah, and that's how you empower the people and that's how you empower that -- that type of, ah, ah, self satisfaction. You know, so ...
L:  Yep.
R:  And -- and I think you know, ah, and like you said, yeah, there is a lot of junk on -- on computers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, you know, but, there again, you just have -- if you raise your kids and -- and have them with enough faith and enough background, um, to know that what's right and what's wrong --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, yeah, they're gonna stray, you bet. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But at least you're there to help them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  To make it through those muddy watered times.  You know, and, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that's where, ah, you know, that's where parenting comes in.  You know, and -- and you know what?  I mean, are we easy parents?  No.  I mean, I'm pretty strict on my kids.  You know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so's my wife.
L:  That's good.
R:  But you know what?  Everybody that comes to our house --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or every -- everywhere -- every place we take our kids, they're like, "Oh, my god.  I can't believe how good your kids are".
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean, "Where did you get them?"  You know?  And it's, like, well, you know, what, it's a lot of work.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Huh.  It's a lot of work.  
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.
R:  But they're -- but it's -- you know, they're a product of -- of my wife.
