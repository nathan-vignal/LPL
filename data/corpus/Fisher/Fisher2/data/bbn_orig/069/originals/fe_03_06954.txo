R:  Ok- -- I'm doing really good, Judy.  Uh, I guess our topic is, uh, how the internet or the computer, uh, is in education today?  Um, I --
L:  I -- I didn't hear the whole topic.  Was it how it's good --
R:  [SIGH]

R:  Is it -- okay, um -- is it -- how does it help education?  Is it good --
L:  Does it help education?
R:  Right.  Is it good or is it bad?  Um, I personally feel that it's, um -- it's good as long as it's used the correct way.
L:  I agree a hundred percent.
R:  Yeah --
L:  It -- it --
R:  -- and I think children have to be monitored and I think, um, you know, it's educational, uh, for -- for when we need to look up things.
L:  Absolutely.  It can only be a help to -- to children if, as you said, they're using it in the right way.
R:  [NOISE] Absolutely.
L:  If they're using it to help them get -- selves get, um, more information --
R:  Mhm.

R:  A monitor where they can only go to certain sites on the computer.
L:  Very important.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Unfortunately --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- of what is happening today.
R:  Oh, absolutely, ab- -- absolutely.
L:  It's a sad state but that's --
R:  I get a lot of news on -- on the computer, education -- and it gives me an education on the news because I can't always read, uh, the newspaper.  I don't have time, I have a very busy life. [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's wonderful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It --
R:  Do you, um -- do you use the computer a lot?

R:  Okay, this is -- this is, uh, a -- a wonderful, wonderful educational website, um, there's a lot of chats going on, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but there's a lot of, uh -- lot of information.
L:  Well, all these sites, and the same with education, it te- -- it helps you not waste your money.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And it helps the children not waste their time either and learn facts that we could never learn in school.
R:  Oh, I know, we --
L:  We had to use these horrible encyclopedias for --
R:  Or the library or --
L:  And another good source of information I have found this year, and I didn't know it existed, is the library itself --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, well, I know in Morris County --
R:  Right.
L:  -- can't speak for others, has a way that you can, um -- if you email them and you want information on something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they will look it up and direct you to it.  They also will help kids with their homework.
R:  How about that.
L:  Yep, and I never knew this was available, I only knew it -- found out because I took couple courses --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- free courses at the library on computers and finding information or I would have never known but kids can call there and they get directed to what websites or books --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- will be useful to them and they want to help you and then -- I've written for many things, medical things, other things, um, their answers are very -- they're very quick on answering you back and they said, like, at this course I took, "Please use us, that's what --"
R:  [MN]
L:  "-- we're being paid to do", that's their job.
R:  That's their job.  How about that.
L:  "And if you don't use us, then we'll be out of work someday".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's their attitude.
R:  That's -- that's good to know because I haven't been to the library for a long time because base --
L:  You don't have to go, you can just email them.
R:  You -- yeah, how about that.  You can email for educational things.  I -- I know for my own self when I went to buy a car, uh, you know, I got all the information, um, off the computer, what to look for.
L:  That my husband didn't believe in.
R:  [LAUGH] He didn't believe that?
L:  I disagree with him.  We just got a car and I said to him -- he wouldn't go in.
R:  But it -- but it tells you everything you -- that you needed to know, um, about the car that you were looking for.
L:  Well, he's so into cars, he says, "I know everything I need to know".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's one of those, you know --
R:  One of those.
L:  -- the guy that doesn't -- that doesn't ask directions at the corner.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I say, "Oh, you're one of those".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I -- I -- I know about one of those. [LAUGH]
L:  One of those.
R:  One of those.  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, um, I really think you'll enjoy this res- -- refunding site, Refunding Makes Cents --
L:  Oh, I'm definitely going to go into it.
R:  -- because, um, as soon as, you know -- you'll see what I mean.  I mean, they offer you so many -- so many free items and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and tell you where the bargains are and who's doub- -- who's doubling coupons and --
L:  Well, that's what I like.
R:  -- online codes.  Right now there's a, um -- just to give you a little bit of an education, there's a, uh, kitchen aid mixer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for ninety nine dollars at Amazon dot com.
L:  That sounds very cheap.
R:  Yeah, well it's, um -- and you get a twenty dollar gift certificate back.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's only seventy nine.
R:  It's a three hundred watt, ultra powered, stand mixer, white on white, for nine -- ninety nine ninety nine and it ships free --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and you get a bonus of, um, twenty dollars Amazon gift cer- -- gift certificates and --
L:  I'm going to have to go into it because the only one I have found is Fat Wallet and if you're saying it's better than that --
R:  Oh, it's better.
L:  -- 'cause all this one --
R:  It's much better because it's -- it's women all throughout the United States reporting, educating us, reporting, um, what's good in the areas, what's good in -- in this -- this area and where you can find this item and, um, they're just reporting on where you could find items on the internet for -- in -- inexpensive --
L:  [NOISE] [COUGH]
R:  Inexpensively, and if you have a question you ask does anyone know, uh, where I could get blah, blah, blah, blah --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- and somebody'll answer you.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Really.  They -- they'll tell you where, um -- it -- I mean, it gives you a good education, um --
L:  [NOISE] There's so many things that I --
R:  -- and they're pretty reliable.
L:  -- probably wouldn't know today if it wasn't for the computer. [LAUGH]
R:  Me, either. [LAUGH]
L:  Really, I -- I --
R:  Me, either.  I think once you're over fifty I think, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Over fifty, we need all the help.
R:  We -- we sure do and it -- you know, it's nice that you -- we don't have to go out, that you, you know, you can sit on the computer and actually order things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're less expensive than if you went to the stores.
L:  Sometimes I sit in too often.  But you can also take all these discounts to the store --
R:  Yes, you can.
L:  -- and get it.  Oh, you have to pay for this one?
R:  Refunding Makes Cents?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, you do, you have -- you -- you can join, um -- you can join and, um, I think over the internet and it's cheaper than getting the book.  You know, she -- she does a book every month.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember it as a book, something refunding, years ago.
R:  Right, but I mean --
L:  I'm on the site.
R:  Yeah, did you -- do you see the, uh, Amazon factory reconditioned kitchen aid?
L:  Um --
R:  It's down --
L:  -- I'm right at sub- -- subscriptions, I don't know if --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- they'll let me go into it.  Can you go in?
R:  Um, she puts a -- there's one thing, uh, it's open to all, today's hot de- -- deals.
L:  Okay.  It won't let me back up so I'm going to have to go off of it.
R:  And then all the way down the -- down the bottom --
L:  I guess they're going to make me go off of it and come back on it.  I think my computer just froze.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Typical.
R:  And off to the side [MN] there's all kind of codes --
L:  Gee. [NOISE]
R:  -- that you can use for all -- all different stores.
L:  [NOISE] Son of a gun.
R:  Do -- do -- do you see it now?
L:  It froze.
R:  [SIGH] Oh, your computer froze?
L:  It froze. 
R:  Oh, that's the time to boot it.  At least we're not on the computer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you got paid for any of these yet?
R:  No, I haven't.  How about you?
L:  No.
R:  But there's a lot of discussion on, um, Refunding Makes Cents.  This is where I -- this is where I -- I joined, okay, for the Fisher studies.
L:  Okay.
R:  And they say that you get paid, uh, once a month, um, I think after you complete your fifth call.  I think that's what it was.  But --
L:  Oh, I know they called me the other day but I wasn't home.
R:  But they -- they keep on calling.  They keep on calling because they can --
L:  Yes, they do.
R:  They -- they've missed me several times and, um, I've done two others.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I talked to a girl out in California and --
L:  This is my second.
R:  This is -- okay, and I spoke to, uh, one other girl.
