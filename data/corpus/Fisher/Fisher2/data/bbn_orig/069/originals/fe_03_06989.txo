L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  My name's Dan- -- 
R:  I'm Brenda.
L:  Hi Brenda.  I'm Danielle.  I'm from north Dak- -- 
R:  Hi Danielle.
L:  I'm from north Dakota.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  From north Dakota. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm down here in Saint Petersburg, Florida.
L:  Oh, well, we can't be much further away can we?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, my gosh.  North Dakota.  Wow, that's a ways away.
L:  That's way up there.
R:  Wow.  Okay, I guess our topic for the evening is education and computers.
L:  And I'm a teacher [LAUGH] so -- 
R:  Well, then, you probably can probably tell me a little bit first because I'm not in the teaching -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um -- 
L:  I'm a teacher and I have three children of my own.
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] Um, I guess for me I see computers as helping education because, um, there's very few jobs nowadays that you get when you get out of school that don't have some type of use of some kind of computer system.
R:  That's true.
L:  [MN] Ah, I --  
R:  That's true.  I just -- 
L:  -- don't see it as being a -- 
R:  -- I -- I'm sorry.
L:  [LAUGH] That's okay.  I see it more as a -- as a supplement to what you already learn in the classroom.  I mean, I don't think -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that computers should be teaching anybody their math and doing all those things.  I think it's a supplement -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- to assist the kids.
R:  Right, because even when I was in school -- I date myself.  Um, I graduated in nineteen sixty six from high school.  So, we weren't even using, um, [MN] even a calculator.  I mean, we could use a slide rule in math but computers weren't even -- they weren't even in the schools at that time.
L:  And so now that computers came out, were you scared to use them?
R:  Oh, my gosh.  Um, I couldn't even check my own email back in nineteen -- what, like, in two thousand and one.  I didn't even know how to do it and I -- I think I've done well.  In about a year I've learned how to check my own email.  I research companies now and I think it's -- it's great because it's a whole other ballgame out there.
L:  In -- 
R:  And I was so intimidated by the darn thing.  I was scared of it.  I -- you know, I thought that I was going to kill the computer or something but --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, [LAUGH] it -- I get on line now and it's great.  It's a whole different -- whole different life.
L:  Yeah, I -- I'm on line daily doing, um, my email and I do +coupons on there.  I do all sorts of stuff.  I am on line all the time.
R:  Wow.  That's like the first thing I do in the morning is I check my emails, send out messages that I have to send because now I actually use it, um, [MN] along with my business at home.  So, I -- I think it's great.  I think the fact of people actually using the computer and getting kind of used to it, it can also lead to, ah, being able to make money in other ways.
L:   Mhm.
R:  So, I -- 
L:  And I -- 
R:  -- I think it's good for students.
L:  And I just think the way kids can research different parts of the world and find out things.  You can download live video and pictures and just things that you wouldn't get in a textbook.  Up to date information -- 
R:  Oh, I know.  Um, have you ever gone to -- I -- I guess I can say this, um, base dot com?
L:  No.
R:  It's -- actually it's a NASA site and I was able to watch -- oh, it was like live stuff where you could actually get on there and see these things going live, you know, with the, um, international space station stuff and everything.  It was just -- it's absolutely incredible to be able to watch the stuff live and it's like, "Wow".
L:  [MN] And just like with all the stuff with the war coverage and everything, to log on and see it live right there.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  To have it be updated all -- you know, moment to moment, to see all these new pictures and everything.  It changed everything.  And -- 
R:  Yeah, I mean -- 
L:  -- I know --
R:  -- they're not getting it second hand they're getting it first hand.
L:  Right away instead of waiting 'til the six o'clock news to wonder what happened today you can log on and read it where they change the messages hourly.
R:  I -- you know, I don't even get a newspaper.  I know that's awful.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't get it either except for Sunday's.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay, I don't feel so bad.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  No, 'cause I read it on line 'cause it's free.
R:  Right.  Me too.
L:  And so I just -- 
R:  Me too.
L:  -- read it on line.  I only get it Sundays so I can have the ads for the stores.
R:  Right.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe I was the only one that was really trying to cut back there [LAUGH] financially but -- 
L:  No.  I figure -- 
R:  -- ah -- 
L:  -- I pay for the internet already so I just use it that way.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] But, I see in -- in school the children are on the computer all the time.  But, it's intimidating, I think, for them.  Even my eleven year old son's like, "I can't type.  I type so slow".  But, I said, "The more you do it, the faster you'll get and the easier it'll be".  And I said -- 
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  -- that's the way everything's going to be when you get older.  Everything's going to be like typing on the computer.
R:  Why?  I mean, I even order things now on line and I never [LAUGH] -- I never thought that I would be doing this -- what I do.  It's, like -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I order business cards on line, you know, um, supplies -- 
L:  Yeah, my husband orders -- 
R:  -- all kinds of stuff.
L:  -- all of his office supplies for his business too on line.  He logs on and orders it all up and he'd spend -- and he'd say, "I'm never through the office.  I don't have to go looking".
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, and the stuff just shows up by UPS [LAUGH] at the [LAUGH] door.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] You know -- 
L:  I mean, I -- 
R:  -- I mean, it's great.  And -- 
L:  And kids -- 
R:  -- you can track packages.  I mean, it's, oh, my gosh.
L:  And kids like it too.  There's lots of kids sites out there for kids to go in and just look at and to play on.
R:  I found a site and it has to do with kids that were, ah, very creative and inventing type of things and I -- I think it may have gotten eliminated when my daughter switched out my computer towers.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think all the memory is sitting in the other computer tower but it was -- it was a wonderful website of all these kids that, ah, they were very creative and, um, oh, it -- it was just really incredible.  You -- 
L:  It just -- 
R:  -- know, kids that -- that had, um, come up with different things.  Different toys and all kinds of stuff.
L:  My son just did his science six grade science fair project and he said, "I just" -- I said, "How'd you decide?"  "Well, I just logged on to Google.  Typed in fifth grade science fair and out popped all these web pages and I just decided from that".  So, I was like --  
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just -- I mean, they just went to the computer lab.  Everyone searched and looked and I said, "It was so helpful".  I said, "He didn't need our help.  He did all the research he needed to all on his own and was ready to go".  So, it was kind of nice.
R:  Wow.  You know, my kids are grown so, I mean, I'd be helping out my grand kids now --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- even the -- like the -- the CD's that they have for kids -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for learning.  I know, um, my daughter had picked up some really nice ones, you know, having to do with all the different kinds of science things.  Biology, mathematics, and you just, you know, stick it in there.  Put the disk in there and download it and off you go. 
L:  Yeah, my -- my -- 
R:  And it -- it -- 
L:  -- eleven year old has Maths Blaster and even my two year old daughter, um, she plays on the toddler games that we have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  Yeah.  Ah, Crys- -- 
L:  -- she'll come and ask, "I want to play Pooh on the computer".
R:  Yeah, Crystal had, ah, oh, I think it may have been the  Maths Blaster and then she had some reading stuff that she had ordered -- 
L:  Yeah.  My -- 
R:  -- ah -- 
L:  -- kids have all the Reader Rabbits and -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Reader Rabbit.  I almost forgot about Reader Rabbit.
L:  And my kids love to play the games on there and can sit and I said, "And they're so easy to start out with and the kids are learning".  I said, "My son who's six [several inaudible words] come downstairs.  He can turn on the computer.  He can start up his own game".
R:  Wow.  To -- 
L:  So, I guess we're -- 
R:  -- think that we didn't have that stuff when we were growing up.
L:  No.  Ah, we did typewriters. 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I don't -- I don't know when you graduated but, like, when I graduated in sixty six, I mean [LAUGH] -- I mean, electric typewriters were in the classroom but then they also had, like, the regular manual --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  The regular manual ones and at that time you were using carbon paper.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.  I date myself.  [LAUGH] You know, I think it's a lot better for the kids.
L:  But, the keyboards are still the same.  That's the good news.
R:  Yeah, that's good.  At least they didn't move that stuff around -- 
L:  Yeah, all the letters -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- are still in the same spot and everything.  So --  
R:  Yeah.  From memory A.S.D.F.G. space semi L.K.J.H. space, yeah, ah, okay.  [LAUGH]  You know the little -- the typing --  
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, did you have to do that too and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they covered the keys so that you wouldn't cheat like, ah -- 
L:  I just -- I just think it's a wonderful -- wonderful -- wonderful new resource for -- 
R:  Yeah.  I wish my mom had a computer.  I mean, she's like in her seventies but I -- I think that if she was to get used to it, like how I did because I was terrified of it just a couple of years ago.  I mean, I thought I was going to blow up the computer if I did the wrong thing or whatever.  I think she would be able to, um, correspond with people better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know -- 
L:  It's -- using the phone's expensive --
R:  -- rather than having to do -- 
L:  -- but it's cheap to do it this way.
R:  I know.
L:  And with instant messenger you can sit and talk the whole time.  And my mom and I have microphones set up on ours so we actually just talk.  We don't even have to type.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.  So, I said it's cheap --
