L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi.  
R:  I didn't -- I didn't hear you. [LAUGH] Hi.  I'm Willeen[?].  I'm calling from Tennessee.
L:  I'm Stephanie and I live in New Jersey.
R:  Ah, oh, wow.  East Coast?
L:  Yeah.  We just got all this rain, which is ridiculous but, ah [LAUGH] -- 
R:  It's raining here too.
L:  -- it's sunny and my daughter wants to play baseball.  We just went in the yard but my neighbour put a fence up and it keeps going over into their yard.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, we're going down to the ball field here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry.  Do you happen to be an RMC reader?
R:  No.
L:  Okay.  I was just curious about that because that's how I found out about this.
R:  No.  Uh-uh.
L:  Now, the -- the topic was computers and education?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they wanted to know what?  If they improve?
R:  Right.  If they improve education.
L:  Mm.  Do you have any children in the school system?
R:  I have no children in the school system but I did get a masters degree in -- in the year of two thousand --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and it took me two years.  But during that two year program, I can count the times that I went to the library because I had a computer.
L:  Right.  And that's how I feel about it.  I have a nine year old daughter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hold on a second.  What's the matter?  I know, Loren.  I'm gonna add the time back.  I'm sorry.  Um, yeah, I have a nine year old daughter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm not crazy about them using the computers in the schools because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you don't know exactly what they're doing.
R:  [MN] Mhm.
L:  You don't know what content they're looking at.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But as far as remembering when I was a kid, and being spread out on the floor with mom and dad and the Encyclopedia Britannica --
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  -- and now it's, like, one click you can find, you know, fifty thousand --
R:  Everything.
L:  -- websites on one subject.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think it's a wonderful thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think computers in education ju- -- they had -- they go hand in hand.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the kids need it for tec- technology, I mean, as they get older, you know, they have kindergartners doing computers now.
R:  Mhm.  Mm.
L:  And, I mean, there's some kids who know more than my husband does.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Y- -- I mean, second graders --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and they need it because as they get older and -- and as technology becomes more and more, um --
R:  Advanced.
L:  -- a- advanced, that's it, that -- I mean, it's going to be like the Jetsons soon.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  We're gonna be flying around in these little things, you know [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hand held computers, you know, and all this --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] 
L:  -- so I -- I think it's a wonderful thing.  I think it's a huge plus.
R:  Ah, I totally agree.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I wonder, [PAUSE] knowing what I've just said --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I rarely went to the library --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but the library was a -- a source of, ah, socialization and the computer can be too.
L:  It can be but you don't really know who you're talking to.
R:  Right.
L:  That's the -- that's the downside of it.  You don't know, I mean, there's a lot of, unfortunately, crazy[?] people out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and if your kid is on the Internet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, they post, "I'm nine and I'm a female" that could be a problem.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I loved the library as a kid because there were no computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it wasn't just socialization, I loved to read --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or, I mean, that's all I did as a kid and, you know, you can't -- it's not like reading a book that you took out of the library --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and reading an online book or listening to an audio book --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- are completely di- different things and -- hold on.  What's the matter, Loren? [NOISE] I told you before.  No, not now, Loren. [NOISE] I -- [SIGH] [NOISE] certain contents, I understand that, there's -- there are security [NOISE] I understand that.  The school has [NOISE] I know that.  I know that.  But, also there's kids in the school who will, you know, hack, yeah, and they do things where they can take the security warnings --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- down.
R:  That's right.
L:  So, I mean --
R:  Because they're smart people.
L:  They're -- they're very intelligent.  They are so ahead of where we were at their age --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it's frightening.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  I did --
R:  I think -- [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
R:  [LAUGH] I think some schools even like -- I'm talking [inaudible] about on the university and college level --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some schools even allow the, ah, students to have email addresses.
L:  Yes, they do.  That I have a problem with.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have a problem with them having email addresses and also with, um, [LIPSMACK] I believe that, at one time, they were -- it was like, um, I dunno, steal a thesis dot com or something.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, it was --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it -- that's frightening to me.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  That, you can, like, plagiarize something off of the Internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're not really learning then.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You're not really learning and your computers are -- are good and then [LAUGH] on the other hand, people do abuse --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the power that's within them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's not a healthy thing either because then you're not really learning.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, stealing something off another, you know, person's paper --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and that's not good.  And e- -- I mean, emailing and all this kinda thing, that -- that's, you know, that's for after hours, that's not for school time.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, that shouldn't be allowed.  You know, we have a neighbour who's got twins at Roscoe's[?] University.  This is their first year.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, they're -- they've got their partying and their down time after tests and, you know, email should be part of that, not part of their schooling.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You shouldn't be able to email someone right in the middle of a class, you know --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that -- that's not -- that's not, um, learning at all, so.  
R:  Do you think -- 'cause I was watching, ah, Judge Larry Joe --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] ah, last week and the, ah, there was a parent who bought her son a laptop because he was on his way off to college.  And the laptop was not a good one and they ended up having to sue to get the money back.  But as part of your -- your child's college, going away stuff, would you get your child a -- a laptop?
L:  No.  
R:  Or -- or a computer or a PC?
L:  Computer. 
R:  Okay.
L:  They -- they don't really -- unless you're in the business world and you need --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to be kept in constant contact --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with your colleagues --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I really don't -- you know, people on airplanes, yeah, you need your laptop when you're taking a six hour flight somewhere, across country --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you need to keep in touch.  You need to finish a project.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But kids, I mean, today they've got the cell phones, and they've got the credit cards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the laptops --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where does it end?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's just ridiculous.  When I was a kid there was no -- you know, Atari twenty six hundred was, like, a cool thing.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That little walk a walk[?] pac man thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now, you know, you get your kid a Gameboy, it's not good enough.  They wanna game way advanced six months later.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It just goes -- it's too much already.  It's too much.  Kids should not be nineteen walking around with a cell phone and a beeper and a laptop and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- all these latest gadgets.  
R:  Well, I -- if --
L:  I wonder, sometimes, because twenty five years ago we didn't have these things.  We went on vacation, we went for --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a drive somewhere --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we weren't in constant contact with the outside world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we didn't fall off the face of the earth.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, we didn't need --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to keep in constant contact --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- with one another, I -- so I don't really see the point in students and laptops.
R:  I am -- I happen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be a juvenile probation officer and you would be surprised how many of my juvenile probationers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- have cell phones or pagers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's just always amazing to me.
L:  My cousin and his wife are both, um, correctional officers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at, um, at Richter's[?] Island.
R:  Oh, get out of here.
L:  Both of them are.  And, ah, that's what my cousin always wanted to do, as a kid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's all of like twenty eight or twenty nine now. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he and his wife are both correctional officers there.  And they say the same thing.  These kids come in and they have to, like, confiscate their stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they've got, like, seventeen, eighteen year old kids who are being treed- -- you know, treated as adults --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because of whatever crimes they may have committed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the same thing.  They've got the cell phone, they've got the beeper and they've got all this --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- technology.  They've got these palm pilots and I'm going, "What does an eighteen year old --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- kid need with a palm pilot?  How many addresses could he possibly ...?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  It just, you know, it -- there's -- it has to e- -- it has to end somewhere.  It has to stop.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you get these kids the Gameboy and six months later the Gameboy advance and the Sega, then the Playstation, by the time they're sixteen --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they're gonna want the newest car and they're gonna to expect --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a palm pilot and it's just not right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- I don't think it's acceptable at all, and like I said, we were not in constant contact twenty five years ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't know what the obsession is with, um, having to be reachable every second of the day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I do not own a cell phone.  I don't care to own a cell phone.  I don't want to be reached --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- every second.  That's why I have an answering machine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  When I get home, I'll return my calls.  I don't want to be reached when I'm on the road.  You know, I'm not that important.  [LAUGH] You know, I'm -- I'm only an artist.  If my editors can't reach me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they'll call me the next day, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, that's it.  And, um, have you lived in Tennessee your whole life?
R:  My entire life.
L:  Wow.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wh- wh- what part are you in?
R:  I'm in, ah, Nashville, Tennessee, middle Tennessee.
L:  See now, I don't know where -- I should grab my address book because a friend of ours moved to Nashville.  
R:  Get out of here.
L:  He's, like, really hip on the music scene.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he knows Mor Tierney[?], the woman from Yar[?], they were friends.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  They went to NYU together.  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They went to NYU together and he did the score for her husband's latest movie.  But I'm not sure where in Nashville he lives.  He keeps telling us, "Come down and visit, co- " -- we're from New York originally.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm like, "Nashville, let me see?" [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, I have a nine year old that's, like, if she's not into the music scene, are there museums, is there an amusement park or anything else? [LAUGH] 
R:  The amusement park closed about three or four years ago and they opened up an -- an outlets mall on this premises --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- like a hundred and ten acres.  It was Opry[?] Land.
L:  Okay.
R:  And now it's Opry meal[?] outlet.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Ah, the nearest amusement park is probably Bowling Green, Kentucky, which is about an hour away from here.
L:  Well, that's not too bad.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's not too bad.
R:  They -- they do have a -- we do have a museum, it's called the Frisk[?] Centre.  Our senator, Senator, um, Frisk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who, he was the guy, remember, when somebody, ah, shot -- somebody tried to, ah, to get into -- I -- I don't remember if it was the White House and they shot this, er, the Capitol security guard?
L:  Yes.
R:  He was the, ah, senator that was able to perform CPR --
L:  Oh, no way.
R:  -- on the -- that's it.  He's our senator.
L:  That's funny.
R:  See, so his -- his family has money, obviously, and obviously he is a surgeon, he's a heart surgeon, that's his specialty.
L:  Right.
R:  So, ah, his family, ah, donate, I don't know how many thousands of dollars to the Frisk Centre so they named the Frisk Centre, our museum, after his family.
L:  Well, that's -- that's nice though.
R:  Mhm.  And they also have a wing  --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of a hospital.  I forgotten which -- oh, uh, hey, I just forgot the -- the wing of the ho- -- the name of the hospital too.
L:  That's amazing.  We're actually going -- my daughter has a [NOISE] -- her second school trip this year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We're going to Trenton tomorrow which, I mean, is -- is --
R:  New Jersey.
L:  -- state, yeah, state capital and we're going to the Governor's building --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and supposed to meet the Governor and I've got some questions for him [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Last time they'll invite me as one of the parent chaperons.  [LAUGH] 
R:  But you guys had a female governor a couple of years ago, right?
L:  Yeah, we had, ah, Christine Whitman[?].
R:  That's right.
L:  She became head of the EPA for George Bush.
R:  Okay, okay.
L:  She just, a week and a half ago, resigned.  
R:  Hm.
L:  I didn't realize that when she signed on with him, um, at this last -- if you wanna call it an election [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when she signed on [LAUGH] I don't know what to call that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Fiasco. [LAUGH] Um, when she signed on with him, I never realized she left her children and her husband here in New Jersey.  I thought they went with her.
