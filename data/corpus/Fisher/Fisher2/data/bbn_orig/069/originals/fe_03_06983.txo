R:  [NOISE] 
L:  Honey, I don't know what I'm doing.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Um, hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] My name's Nancy.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we're supposed to talk on the topic of computers in education.
L:  Are we supposed to do this for ten minutes?
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  I'm really confused.  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH] How do you do -- you ever done -- okay.
R:  No, I've not -- I've not done it before though.
L:  Okay.  I haven't either.  Okay -- 
R:  Okay.  So, this is my first -- 
L:  Okay.  So, we're supposed to talk about whether computers harm education or help it?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.  Um, [LAUGH] what -- 
R:  Just that -- 
L:  -- is your opinion?
R:  Well, you sound like a student.  Is that right?
L:  Uh-huh, that's correct.
R:  Yeah, um, how old are you?
L:  I'm -- I'm twenty six.
R:  Oh, so you're an old student?  I don't -- 
L:  Yeah, I am an older student.
R:  -- mean -- I don't mean [LAUGH] -- that's right.
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Well, I'm, um, a substitute teacher, actually.  So, um -- 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And the kids in -- and I do it mostly in high school.  I mean, all the time in high school now and I don't think that they probably couldn't hardly exist without computers in our school, it seems like. 
L:  Oh, yeah, I don't think so either.  I -- I wonder if they mean, um, 'cause I know in the fact of, like, researching things, I think -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's definitely easier.  But, I don't know if that's a helping thing 'cause kids definitely read books less.
R:  Well, that's for sure.
L:  And also like with Spell check and all of that, like they probably don't, um, learn to spell as well -- 
R:  Right.  I would definitely -- 
L:  -- because you always have the -- 
R:  -- agree with you on all that kind of stuff too.  I know, it's really a kind of iffy half and half, you know, half good, half bad just because of the fact that the things you said.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, everything is so much more available at their fingertips.  I mean -- 
L:  Yeah, and it's more -- 
R:  -- in our library -- 
L:  -- and it's -- it's more up to date too.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause encyclopedias is how I used to study.
R:  Right.
L:  And you know, those are -- 
R:  Are you in -- 
L:  -- always -- once you bought 'em they're already outdated.  So -- 
R:  Ex- -- right.  Exactly.  I mean, we don't even -- um, the school -- our school is fairly new, like, less than ten years' old and it's -- I don't think our school even hardly has -- you know, I could probably count the number of books on [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- not on one hand but it's really pretty much the internet and, um, one of the drawbacks, though I do think, you know, it's hard to control.  Not that you want to control, control but -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- be aware of what everybody's always doing on the computer even if you have screens -- I mean, um, [MN] locks on things and -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- all that.  Especially in high school, well I don't know, probably in lower grades as well. 
L:  Yeah, that's another thing too 'cause I know, like with home computers even if you have blocks and stuff, sometimes they can still get past them.
R:  Right.
L:  And I know too like with, um -- like there's different -- ah, like Cinderella and the White House and things the kids would normally be studying, if they put 'em -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in a certain way it's -- it's pornography.
R:  Right.  Exactly -- 
L:  So, if it's -- if they're on a computer that's not controlled then, um, yeah, they could easily get into that stuff which is -- that's definitely not a good thing.
R:  Right.  But, I mean, without kids learning about how do you -- you can use computers in school, I mean, their place in the workforce would just be really still limited.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, that's -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean, I -- I haven't been in, ah, like, grade schools that much at all.  But, lately in the last several years the -- 
L:  Well, yeah, my, um, my niece, well, she's seven now but I know that her school, um -- you're not at school but her actual, um -- she started using computers when she was about two and a half, three.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  She started doing, like, the preschool programs on the computer and she actually probably knows her way around it even better [LAUGH] than me now. 
R:  Really.
L:  'Cause they have -- uh-huh.  In their class -- I think that they have two computers in each classroom.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's in south Carolina though, but I don't know how it is here now.  But -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, yeah, I mean, I definitely think it's good 'cause that's the way that everything's -- that's the direction everything's going in and if they weren't taught on computers then they wouldn't have all that knowledge when they did get out in the workforce.
R:  Right.  Right.  And I think that the main thing is so much of, like, historical things are -- well, I think it's still that's like kind of a -- really a topic that's not, um, [MN] I don't think it's taught accurately or taught enough of --  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- as it is but at least with computers when it becomes reenacted, you know, a lot of times on -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the screen, I think that really helps and, um, you know makes it more real for -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for kids to be able to understand what the -- 
L:  Yeah, I agree with that.
R:  -- background is in all of that.  I don't know if -- I mean, I haven't really seen how much it's used in subjects other than history or you know, lit- literature, that sort of thing as far as math or science and [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  And there's also -- like, that's another good thing.  [several inaudible words] there's a lot of different, um -- I know like with her programs a few -- there's a few [inaudible] it's usually educational programs and I know that, like -- I think, like, well I guess I would say I don't have a problem with the internet but I think that, um, like the CD roms and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like that kind of education I think is really good for 'em.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I think like with the -- like we were saying with the internet and the, um, you know, that you do -- like they -- they have like a thes- -- a thesaurus and a dictionary and all of that right at their fingertips.  I don't know if that's -- 
R:  Is that official or -- 
L:  Yeah, like with the -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- Spell check.  I don't know any kind of thing that makes them lazy.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Well, I mean, I do think there is definitely something to that especially with, like, spelling or and with, um, just composing.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  That too, 'cause I know when I was learning all of that it was like when you, um, [MN] learned how to, ah, like set up paragraphs and all those kinds of things.
R:  Right.
L:  And now on the computer I know from the program we have on our computer if you -- if it's -- that your paragraphs are set up wrong or whatever it'll just automatically tell you.
R:  Oh, really.
L:  And like, it'll tell you, like, if it's an incomplete sentence or if, you know, it's a f- -- a fragment or a frag- -- well, you know, all that stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  And so and I know when I was in school I had to learn all that stuff so -- 
R:  Well, and then that other issue which I'm not that aware of that I know of, you know, how a lot of, um, papers, like college papers or term papers or whatever, they're easily able to just get the whole paper right -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know that -- 
R:  -- off the internet.
L:  -- [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that is -- that's way to easy.  I know [inaudible] -- I know when I was in college, um, in one of my, ah, literature classes a bunch of kids got busted for doing that.
R:  Did they really?
L:  Uh-huh.  The kids, they had gotten them off the internet 'cause there's -- 
R:  How did -- 
L:  -- some -- there's a bunch of different websites for it.
R:  Okay.  So, how were they -- how were they busted.  I mean, how did --
L:  Ah -- 
R:  -- they know?
L:  -- because they say that they were -- I'm trying to remember how they said 'cause there's a lot of sites out there like that.  But, I think they'd just got 'em off of a really popular one.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh -- 
L:  And the teacher was aware of it too.  And I guess he periodically checked it and -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  So.
R:  Huh.
L:  But, that was -- that was even [several inaudible words] -- well, that was probably back in -- that was in ninety seven.  So --  
R:  Right.
L:  Now I think it'd be even tougher 'cause I'm sure there's a lot more websites like that out there.
R:  Right.  No, I would --
L:  So -- 
R:  -- agree with that for sure.  Hm.  Ok- -- 
L:  So -- 
R:  I'm sorry -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I think that's getting a beep but I won't, um -- 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- take -- I won't -- I won't take that [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I promise you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  There was something I saw the other day on, um, the news as well regarding a, um -- that there was actually a benefit to, um, other games and a- -- or kids being on the, um, internet as far as playing -- I don't even know if it was for education really or just video games.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, there was some study about how it is beneficial and, you know, it -- not even just for mental stimulation but even, um -- I don't know.  Did you see that?  It was like either -- either physically -- 
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- or for dexterity.  I mean, it was something you wouldn't expect.  Not just -- 
L:  Really.
R:  -- a learning thing [several inaudible words].  But I of course didn't watch the whole -- 
L:  Because I would think it would be -- I don't -- I just know like with video games on the computer and all that 'cause they're definitely not outside and that has a lot to do with, um, like the obesity rate.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Definitely -- 
L:  I know that, you know, 'cause they're all inside playing video games all day long and I know when I was that young I was outside playing, you know, in sand boxes and all of that.
R:  Right.
L:  And that you were more creat- -- I think also it takes away from the creativeness too.
R:  That -- I mean, that -- 
L:  Because I had to use my imagination a lot more than -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So -- 
R:  Now, to counter that, though, the other day I was subbing in a, um, a class where they were -- it was, ah, like a web design -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- class and you know, I mean, it was, um, [MN] they had to build -- I don't know if it was a web page.  I haven't -- I -- it were a couple of different things and so that was definitely, um, a s- -- a really interesting [inaudible] to see them trying to put that together and find -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- their sources and you know, the cut -- you know, cutting and pasting in the different sites for different, um, graphics and just even type styles and, ah, um, you know, how you would have stuff moving in fl- flashes, flick on and flick off -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and all that kind of stuff.  So, that was pretty -- it's a really popular class at the school too where the kids -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- can, you know, design all the -- and like I say, this isn't high school and they're definitely putting web pages together or putting a web page together for businesses and how they would, you know, go about, um, setting that up and so that -- I mean, that opens a whole new door for -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for educational stuff and versus just, of course, um, you know, typing.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  I know.  Like that's, um -- I think my boyfriend would have been better on this little subject because he's -- his, um, field is information technology so he knows all about this.
R:  Oh, right -- 
L:  But, he [several inaudible words] -- um, I -- see I have a -- I don't like computers.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's not my strength [LAUGH] -- strong -- 
L:  It's not my strength -- 
R:  -- point either.
L:  -- at all.  Like, I'm -- like, I just know with all of that stuff I have a lot of problems with it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, um, yeah, I don't -- I think -- ah, yeah, I think there's definitely pros and cons on both sides, I think --  
R:  So, when you were in high school did you have much access to -- 
L:  Well, see --  
R:  -- computers, 'cause you're fairly -- 
L:  Yeah, I know.  I graduated --
R:  -- [inaudible].
L:  -- in ninety five so I know in my --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- senior year we got a new, um -- in our library we got the computer lab and that's really when we just -- they were teaching us how to surf the net and so -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- I remember in ninety four is when we got our home computer.  So, um -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's definitely -- I know it's a lot more advanced than it was because I -- when I was in elementary school and I remember we had a computer lab and all we did was they would put a -- a maize on the computer like a, um -- a see through maize.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then you would just say, "Right, ninety degree angle" you know, and try to get it to the -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, like, that was it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  And then now when I see what my niece is doing it blows my mind that she's able to do all that at a young age -- 
R:  Right.
L:  So -- 
R:  That's funny, 'cause you're -- like, actually I think you're the same age as my daughter 'cause she graduated in ninety five and so [MN] um -- 
L:  Yeah.  So, it's definitely came a long way.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I -- like I said I think it's good because it's definitely the way the world's going.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, then also, like, I think -- I guess more I don't know if it let's them use their imagin- -- I guess that's --
