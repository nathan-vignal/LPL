L:  Hello.  My name is Sheila.
R:  Hi.  My name is Michelle.
L:  Hi Michelle.
R:  Hi.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Minnesota.
R:  Okay.  I'm in Long Island, New York.
L:  Oh [LAUGH], another New Yorker.  I -- I talked with a New Yorker the other day.
R:  Oh.  This is my first time.
L:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH] In -- interesting.  It -- it's different than what --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- you expect, isn't it?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] So, um, what was it?  Um, [MN] what do agencies think about computers in school?  Do they harm or improve education?  Is that what the question was?
R:  I believe it is.
L:  Okay.  Well, I know that, ah, here in Minnesota it's like everyone is trying to get computers into education and then we read about, for instance, um, some -- someone like Bill Gates or another, ah, person who's a CEO of a technological company and they go back to, like, ah, the school that they went to, you know, that they attended when they were younger and they tried to improve the quality of education, they say, by putting computers in and you know, paying for all of the nice software and hardware.  So, up here I would say most of our agencies would be for it if they had the money.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Oh.  Okay.  I know here in, ah, the school districts they're trying to bring in the computers -- a -- a computer almost for every student in every classroom they want.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so they're aiming for -- they have one in every room, at least one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, [LAUGH] it's a way of life and when the internet goes down [LAUGH] everyone's at a loss.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But -- 
L:  Yeah, and then I know, ah, my son goes to school down in Iowa.  He's thirteen and there are -- [MN] and it's a smaller school.  It's, you know, a consolidated school because they didn't, you know, when you don't have enough people in one town you consolidate the school so that -- I don't think in New York you have that problem but [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, up state New York, I'm sure they do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, not on Long Island.  Long Island we have, ah, like six hundred kids per class.
L:  [LAUGH] Mhm.
R:  That -- that's large.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, some places even are higher.
L:  Here we, ah, in Minnesota we have like about five hundred kids per class and I'm sitting there going, "How do you know the people?"  Because, ah, where I went to school I had a hundred and sixty in my class.  I grew up in Nebraska and it was like, that was the biggest class where -- our class was the biggest class in the history of our school at a hundred and sixty and so -- 
R:  Oh, ah -- 
L:  -- when people say, "Yeah, I graduated with five hundred others" it's like [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH] You -- you don't get to know everyone by any means.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Because -- 
L:  Not even with the hundred and some, you still don't.
R:  Yes, I work in a school district and the three grades -- I work in a high school and, um, the kids are always go -- going to computers and everything but I don't know half the kids at our school.
L:  Oh, [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  You know, just the segment that I deal with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I know as -- as far as computers we have a library where there are banks of computers -- 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  -- where classes come in and, ah, research is done on the computers, no longer in the encyclopedias like when I went to school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that gets [LAUGH] -- 
L:  You have internet access then too?
R:  Yes.
L:  And then it -- I suppose they have quite a few filters to make sure that you can't get onto sites that aren't supposed to be used for classes and stuff like -- 
R:  Yes, they have -- 
L:  -- that or -- 
R:  -- locks on the pornography and even -- even certain things like if the class is dealing with the holocaust.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Certain things they have -- still have a block on.
L:  Oh.
R:  Or even if they do in class where they can -- ah, discussing, um, various moral issues -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, like gun control.
L:  Mm.
R:  The certain sites are blocked.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, the -- the kids have to use it -- do them at -- at home or go sit in the public library -- 
L:  Oh, my.
R:  -- they all have banks of computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, sometimes it's nice to have the blocking on and sometimes it can kind of h- -- like hinder the research.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because sometimes, like, um, they might have a -- like, if you're doing a research on, say, Geoff Gordon, and he's got, like I think, about ten sites that are anti Geoff Gordon and if you were one of those types that you just wanted, you know, positive things instead of wanting to hear about all the [LAUGH] you know, bad things that people say about him, so you block out the bad things that people say.  But, at the same time if you're doing research on it you just get one, you are limited aspect of it then -- 
R:  Right.  One sided and it's -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- not really fair either.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's not.  So -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- did it -- are you -- did you grow up with computers very much or -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah, does it seem really different in the schools compared to when you went to school?
R:  Oh, very different.  I don't know how old you are but I graduated high school in nineteen sixty six.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, how old -- 
L:  A [several inaudible words] lady.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  Um, so we didn't have computers.  As a matter of fact even -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- calculators were h- -- big hand held expensive things.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But, ah -- 
L:  The TI computer -- TIs, ah, calculator was the big computer at that time, I think, wasn't it, or was that even around?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  No, not even.  No, they had the -- oh, they'd plug into the wall big heavy -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  They didn't hardly do anything but other than add -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- subtract, multiply and divide.  You know, that's the way things were then.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know, like my sister graduated in eighty one so, ah --  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- the -- the difference.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, even me -- for me it's really different to see the computers in the classrooms because I wasn't really exposed to computers until I went to college.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And e- -- you know, even though I graduated in nineteen eighty it still was the beginning of computers and, in fact, what I studied was the old cards.  You know, the cards that you would put through the keypunch and you'd -- 
R:  Mm, yes. 
L:  -- punch the holes in 'em and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  RPG Two [inaudible] so you had to feed them through the card reader so that the computer got the, ah, got the coding.
R:  Right.
L:  And then you could work on the coding [MN] with the screen but you had to punch those cards out first and feed them through the card reader and then you could work with it.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness, things have really changed from then.  Oh.
L:  No, kidding.  Ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] even Cobalt I think I had to do that and it was amusing because I took, ah, ah, they had one project that we had to do right before I was going to graduate and you had to do it in Cobalt one.  Well, Cobalt two had a nice -- nice, um, code -- coding that just worked really great with what they wanted us to do whereas Cobalt one, it was -- you know, you had to dr- -- you do, like, a -- you had to write about six hundred lines of coding just to get it to do what, like, fifty lines of coding in Cobalt two would do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I wrote it all in Cobalt two.  Well, unfortunately I was in Cobalt one class so they gave me an incomplete.  They didn't fail me because I didn't complete the assignment but they gave me an incomplete and said, you know, "Very, very forward thinking but you need to do it in Cobalt one".  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] convert it over.  Oh, no. 
L:  So, here -- I'm sitting there doing six hundred lines of coding.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Oh, my goodness.  I -- I've never done anything like that at all.
L:  Oh, well, yeah, that -- that's -- it's an -- it's outdated now, I think.  I mean -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I've heard of it sometimes in some, ah, job interview, you know, in some of the advertisements but mostly, yeah, Cobalt, Fortran, RPG Two, it's like, what?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  That's like a manual typewriter type of thing.  That's another generation, another lifetime ago.
L:  [several inaudible words] and the Olivetti and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, and -- 
R:  And -- and now the kids, they don't even know how to write first drafts.  They do everything on the computer.
L:  Wow.
R:  They go in doing the research.  They cut -- cut and paste into their -- you know, hopefully not too much plagiarism but -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- it makes it easier and with -- with the, um, Powerpoint and the -- the pictures and it's really a -- a first class -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- report that they can turn in now and they can be just in elementary school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've heard their grandparents say, "I don't even know how to turn the computer on" and -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- here are these little kids, "Here, let me show you".  You know, they had to click with the mouse on the -- the games to -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so, by the time they're in school they know what they're doing.
L:  Yeah.  Which is kind of nice but, at the same time, it kind of also takes away the need to learn the skills of, like, putting together sentences and learning penmanship.
R:  Mhm.  I agree.
L:  So, it -- it's -- it's a nice -- it's a -- it's one of those fifty, fifty things I guess.  Six of one and half dozen of another.
R:  Yeah, to gain -- what you do gain, you are giving something else up.
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah.  But, you can even apply to colleges on line.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can pay your bills on line.
L:  Oh, isn't that something else?
R:  You -- you -- you can do, ah, almost anything -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know.  Ah, they're definitely all the negative things, you know, like with the pornography and things like that -- 
L:  And poker and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- and the gambling.  But, ah, it really has added a lot of positive things to our lives.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and there's kids coming out of school, they have so much -- many more benefits than we had.  So much more education, you know, because [LAUGH] it's -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I think a lot of it is due to the computers.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And because they're exposed to more information just by looking through -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everything that --
