L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hey.
L:  My name's Michael.
R:  Hi, my name is Theresa.
L:  Theresa.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hi, I'm in New York City.
R:  [NOISE] I'm in Arkansas.
L:  Arkansas, huh?
R:  Yeah.  So, what do you think about that topic, computers in education?
L:  Ah, I'm actually in school myself, I'm going back to school for some computer ah training I'm going for a Microsoft business applications --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like ah Access and Excel and Word and Powerpoint which I don't know much about so it's all new to me.  I kind of skipped ah getting involved when it was -- computers first came out twenty years go and I never really kept up with it.
R:  Yeah.  Oh.
L:  I don't know, what do you do?
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, ah I -- actually, I got my ah high school diploma off the you know doing it from home on the computer.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  It's interesting.  And so ah also my L.P.N. I used to attend ah Phoenix University --
L:  Okay.
R:  You heard of Phoenix University before?
L:  No.
R:  You haven't?  Okay, it's a college out there, it's a great college and stuff and I went for like a year and then I just wanted to, you know, stay home with my little boy so actually I got my license, you know, like that so it -- it is a great, you know, computers are great these days.  They can be bad, too, you know, you can learn a lot from a computer, you know in education --
L:  Yeah I think it's great --
R:  -- a lot of things.
L:  I didn't know your -- you -- I mean, I -- I've heard of people taking courses online and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I didn't know they could actually get a certification through that.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You can.  Yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah, it's great.
L:  So --
R:  And then too, you know, ah education these days a good for a lot of kids, you know, like hooked on finding some stuff that can go and you know download it, you know, and just read from it, you know, e- -- learn --
L:  Yeah.  I think it's amazing.
R:  -- how to pronounce words and stuff so it's -- it's -- it's good.
L:  I think so many kids go on through school now and know more about computers than some adults.  Obviously they -- they get trained on it so young.  We were trying to think of -- my wife and I were talking about ah when -- at what age or what grade level in school do children get introduced to computers.  Do you have any idea, is it like fifth grade or fourth grade or something?
R:  Yeah.  Ah -- actually, ah, where -- where I'm at it's the second grade, but when I was the one, it was the first grade.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  There here in Arkansas it was the first grade.  When I used to, you know, attend school at that level, but now right now it's second grade.  You know, they start young, you know.  But now --
L:  When did you ah graduate high school?
R:  Huh?
L:  When did you graduate?
R:  Ninety eight.
L:  Ninety eight, all right.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  So, you're like twenty years old?
R:  Yeah, twenty two.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  But um -- but, yeah, it's good and great, you know, but where I'm at now in Arkansas the schools now, you know, stop kids from typing a you know like illegal things, drugs, the pornos on the ah computer so what they did is they went up there and did something, I don't know what they did, but they um --
L:  They have to block that stuff.
R:  Yeah, block that stuff off --
L:  From [inaudible].
R:  -- and now they can just only type in educational things that is regarding the school and so I think that's great, too.
L:  Yeah.  I think that was probably a big concern initially ah when introducing co- -- the Internet to school was the w- -- you know, the dangers of kids getting invo- -- on some sensitive sites, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, yeah, I think that's good that they ah -- but, yeah, I think it's a great tool.  It's -- it's certainly ah -- a wealth of ah information and resources for more information, you know, than ever was available before, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you could look on -- up any topic at all, it's -- yeah, so I think it's a great benefit for education.  So, did you find out about this ah survey -- how did you -- did you find out about on the Internet or ...?
R:  Ah, n- -- let me see, well, my cousin, she is telling me about and I went, I think I went, typed in the address bar what she gave me and it came up some Fisher thing?
L:  Oh yeah, Fisher.  I'm not sure what the name of it is, but yeah.  That's what I heard.
R:  Fisher something like that, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I saw it on the Internet and I just signed up and they called me every night and I keep turning it down.  I did one of them like probably two weeks ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I even forget the topic now, but ah -- every night at ten o'clock the phone rings and my wife and I go, "Oh, what's the topic?" you know and [LAUGH] I -- I just figured I'm -- I'm in the bedroom cleaning and I figured the phone rang, "I might as well follow up with one of these, I haven't done in a while".
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  They're fun, you know, I like the ones -- and basically I like the ones on education and computers 'cause like I say, it's -- it's good.  The computer is good for a -- education things and too it's bad, you know.  Because in my local c- -- local library they did the same thing too it's just ah you know, you can't type in, you know, bad things you just only can type in what's going on in the library, like educational books and history and stuff like that.  I think it's good that way, too.
L:  Oh yeah, they limit it to -- in the library so.  Because I know here in the New York public libraries -- I go in a lot and try to use the computers -- but there's such a long waiting list to use them and they limit ah anybody who uses the computer to one half hour.  So, you have to sign up and wait and then you only have a half hour of use.  And you can't get a lot done in a half hour.
R:  Really?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- you [inaudible] hour, where I'm at you go up and there's like thirty minutes and -- and if the lady good, you know, or nice [inaudible] you know say they can stay on there, but yeah they stop that, too, people going up in there and typing bad stuff on the computers and -- and people of you know emailing other people about drugs and stuff, so once another person come in there and pull up the address bar and you know that's still in there and so --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- yeah, so they just stopped that.  Yeah.
L:  Well, I think it's ah certainly beneficial to ah students in school.  What I'm learning now is how to do ah stuff like that's applicable to business and you know spreadsheets and working out ah just business forms for ah -- for small business as well as large business.  So, it's working out good.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, 'cause --
L:  Do you use the computer at ah -- as an L.P.N.?
R:  Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah, a lot.  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  And then also um you know you can go in there and type in like prescription drugs --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- medicine and contacts and just a variety of things come up everywhere, like home business and working from home and stuff.
L:  Sure.
R:  There's so much stuff come up on the computer, you have to be careful because a lot of those scams and want your money and stuff, yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to do that.  So, are you in a hospital, do you work in a hospital?
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  Which one?
R:  I work in um the [inaudible] in Arkansas down here, Mary Lamb Memorial.
L:  Mary Lamb Memorial.
R:  Yeah.  It's a big hospital.
L:  So, I think it's good for ah -- especially good for prescription drugs you can tap in to see if somebody's taking no -- like ah more than one drug you can tap in and see --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if they're going to counteract each other or have ill effects.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Stuff like that.
R:  Yeah, that's a --
L:  So, yeah --
R:  -- it's --
L:  -- it's certainly a benefit there.
R:  Yeah, there's a lot of prescription drugs I've typed in from the Internet and I just -- I haven't heard of them before and I just go in there and just read about them and what they can do and stuff, you know.
L:  Yeah, it's great.
R:  It's interesting, yeah.  [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's just a great -- great amount of ah information available to everyone now, which is great.  I mean, even the world --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you can get onto different sites all over the world.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think ah for educational purposes, I think well like some of the ah big guys who created all the computers, like Bill Gates and all, have been donating a lot of -- a lot of the [MN] computer stuff to schools and ah you know helping promote it more, you know.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And that helps a lot in education as well.
R:  Yeah.  Then too it's good, you know, for kids, you know, that have the reading problems, stuff like that, they can go on there and download free software, like Hooked on Phonics and stuff --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and yeah, they can have words like -- like long words they can't pronounce, they can break 'em up into symbols and stuff it's -- it's very interesting learning.
L:  I never thought of that, ah, Hooked on Phonics is on -- on the computer, I guess it is, yeah.
R:  Yeah, they got it -- yeah, they -- I downloaded it the other day for my little cousin.  Yeah, it's -- it's a free software and if you want like five more on there you can pay like nine ninety five or something like that, yeah.
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  And there's a lot of more on there, you can type in like learning and stuff like that, there's just a variety of things come up everywhere, you know, for little kids to learn that have disability problems and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  I had never learned to type when I was younger and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- saw a website that said ah learn two -- the number two -- type dotcom.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And it had ah just a free website on how to learn to type.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you got to go in and actually do it and practise on it, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but I think it's a great tool.
R:  Yeah.  It is a great thing for little kids.  And being too, you know, the computers at home and stuff like that these days, you know, kids going there and typing illegal stuff and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know with people all overseas and so like that, you know, it can be bad, a computer could be good too, you know, for learning and stuff like that.
L:  Well, yeah, they have to put limits on ah -- on some of the predator kind of stuff that goes on with computers, obviously.  There's a lot of -- lot of people that aren't too nice out there that try to prey on kids and stuff.
R:  Oh yeah, like those chatrooms and stuff and they're saying -- they type in chatrooms, a variety of stuff you can go in there and talk to people to legal ages so you don't have to be legal for seven year olds -- there's a lot of s- --
L:  Yeah, I've never even gone on one of those, I don't even know what they -- you know --
R:  Yeah.  It's a lot of seven and ten year olds [inaudible] by computers and stuff like that they go in and type the websites in and get in these chatrooms with these guys and give out their phone number and they trace their address and stuff like that so -- though, that's --
L:  That's just dangerous.  
R:  Yeah.  That computer is not good for [several inaudible words].
L:  [NOISE] Well, I don't know if they should put more restrictions on it or just put like locks on different -- different things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or I guess parental ah -- parental influence, parents should be like more involved in what the kids are doing on the computer and be more observant, you know.
R:  Yeah, oh yeah.
L:  And certainly if there's you know behaviour that's suspicious going on they should be --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, aware of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If kids are going out and meeting people that they --
R:  Yeah, 'cause one day I just typed in ah www dot letters from home or something like
