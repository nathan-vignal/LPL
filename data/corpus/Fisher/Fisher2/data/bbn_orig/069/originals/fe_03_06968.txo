L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Mike.
R:  Er, ah, hi.  I'm Susannah.
L:  Hi, +Susannah.  Yeah, I'm -- I'm from Virginia.
R:  Ah, I'm from Texas.
L:  Are ya?  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It sounds like our topic to talk about is whether computers, you know, assist or help education or -- or if it doesn't, huh?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And do you have any strong feelings about that or ...?
R:  Um, actually support, what do you think?
L:  Well, I think, I, ah, [COUGH] of course, I work in the computer field [LAUGH]. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  With information technology and I think that's it really good that they're -- they're using computers and I think that the more knowledge that, ah, kids can get, you know, get, ah, familiar with, ah, personal computing with the different, ah, applications and products and be, you know, and skilled in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing so much stuff with [inaudible] and networks and stuff, that that's all great. [COUGH] The more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they can learn the better because it will equip them for what they'll be facing, you know, using and doing in the -- depending on what kinda career --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they go into.  They'll definitely probably use personal computers or they'll be, you know, a lot of 'em are already using it for home use, [inaudible].
R:  Um, what do you think, what are the main advantages of using, ah, computers in education?
L:  Mhm.  Well, I think some of the advantages I can think of is -- is that, ah, obviously they can get, ah, skilled and understand, ah, what's available to search and look at.  Like, if what's -- what the good stuff that's on the Internet.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they also can -- I would think they'd be able to learn some things, like basic things about how to use spreadsheets and how to do wo- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, develop word processing and how to do graphics and other types of, you know, applications --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they could use.  Both in their school work but also it'd be, ah, applicable to things they do in jobs once they, you know, once they graduate --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and get into the -- to the -- I guess into private sector or to whatever government jobs they might work in.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, do -- do you, ah, feel that there are any disadvantages, ah, of the computers?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  Ah, well, the only disadvantage that I can -- I can think is -- is that I do think with the young people both with, ah, what they get at school and -- and the stuff they learn at home, there is a tendency sometimes to -- to spend more time [COUGH] in chat rooms and chatting with friends and -- and, ah, and sometimes even playing games and doing stuff versus actually interacting and going out and doing things with their friends.  Like, you know, how we used to play football and baseball --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and sports and get outside and go hiking and camping and -- and work and do things with people.  I think there -- there is a danger --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of that kinda gets s- -- can start with education process where they get more into fantasy and then to interacting with people online than they do actual having friendships and doing things with other people.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think you are really right in it, that it kinda [LAUGH] -- somebody has to watch it.  
L:  Heh.
R:  That's really in case of the children, the parents.
L:  Right.  I think that, ah, one -- one of the things where -- where, I mean, with our home use, but I guess in schools they do the same thing, of -- of putting the Internet filters and screens and stuff so you just can't get, ah, all the junk that's there.  But, plus, they sometimes, you know -- I know with our daughter we have to push her to get out and get with her friends and do stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- versus just sitting on a computer and chatting --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with people or chatting with the same friends who are all online.  And at night time, when it's dark and, you know, they're home, that's one thing, but sometimes they want to do it on a beautiful Saturday afternoon --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when there's -- when they could be out doing things together and running around.  And we try to -- we try -- and I -- I don't know that I really say the education process used causes them to be like that.  I think it's just general home use and things that they get -- they get into sometimes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- and sometimes they're playing games versus actually getting out and doing stuff and getting physical exercise.  I think that's -- that's the area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that I guess I would be concerned with, maybe, sometime this whole use of computers, that we get people so tied into it that they forget to do other things.
R:  Oh, yeah.  But do you know what actually, ah, did my husband -- do you realize that when it's really sunny in life --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we have better Internet connection --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because we have the modem connection [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than, ah, when it is not so nice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it looks like people still, kinda, you know, take off when it is sunny and go out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- instead of sitting.  It means, maybe, maybe not.  It depends who is using the modem.
L:  Right.  Wh- who- -- how many people are online.
R:  [NOISE] Um, yes.  [inaudible] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but -- but it looks like, [PAUSE] ah, we still like to go out when it's sunny [NOISE]. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] But I agree with you.  Ah --
L:  Yeah.  And I dunno, as -- as far as, ah, I -- I dunno the -- the programs and stuff that you have but, I mean, the -- they do -- there does seem to me that in our schools, that the numbers of PCs and the amount of time they get in labs and stuff is incre- -- you know, increasing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where they are getting more exposure to -- to PCs.  Plus I [SIGH] -- I generally guess, in a lot of areas, a lot of people do have homes -- home PCs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not that every family does --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but a lot of families do have home computers.  Some have two and three [LAUGH]. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, in their homes and so that makes a difference maybe, if -- than if you're in an area where you didn't have a home PC. 
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  You know, to use then -- then getting some exposure to in school would be more important.
R:  Yeah, you know, I know that even my mom, she's -- she's not, you know, the first generation of people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who would use computers.  
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, but she got one computer just, ah, to make sure that we could, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- get hold of her through the email and she really likes it.  She says, "Gosh, you know, I don't know how I could --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- ah, be in touch with you if I wouldn't have the -- the email that I can write whenever I want and send out if he's there --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- on the very same day".
L:  Right.  It -- that is a -- that is an amazing change that's -- has taken place in the last ten years where people used to writing all the cards and letters, and they still do a little bit, but it seems like so much stuff gets delivered through email.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  You know what?  I saw that, er, at the beginning I was pretty much, er, traditional, rather writing letters than email.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I just do not have time to write letters and right now I treat email the same, you know, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  How do you say?  That, um, the same level of communication as a letter.
L:  Right.
R:  But maybe it's not -- not really true because we do not have that handwriting or the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- personal things.  But --
L:  Right.
R:  -- somehow it is, uh, replacing it.
L:  Yeah.  It seems like it is but -- but I do think that's another advantage to, you know, to the children getting exposed to the different kind of products and typing skills and stuff because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all that is [COUGH] -- is good in their personal life when they -- because this is just going to keep exploding and new things [SIGH] coming up.  You know, how they all interface, interact with people, you know, through the computers --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and stuff.  And then it -- it's also the -- more and more in the future, may even get to voice recognition and other types of tools that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where you can just talk to your computer and it will basically trans- -- you know, you could be doing other things and talking and it will still write letters and do things, and even I- -- you know, remember calendar dates and remind you, and just all kinds --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of neat things that are coming, I think.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think --
R:  You know, even--
L:  -- as they get exposed to that, in school, that's good.
R:  Mhm.  Actually, my son started.  He's six now and he's started writing letters to his cousin.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On the Internet.
L:  Right.
R:  It's really amazing.
L:  Yeah.  But I -- I mean, that's what's neat about it. I mean, like, if they live in other countries and places --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it -- you know, you're -- you're not limited to -- to huge bills for the -- all the mail postal costs and stuff.  You just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- send it and like you say, it can be there in, depending on, I guess, how long it takes it, how -- how loaded up the email servers are and stuff, it can be there in just a few minutes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And read.  Which is really, really neat.  And, of course, the way the -- my daughter does with friends and stuff that she's met on some different trips and stuff, she communicates on a fairly regular basis where she chats --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- back and forth with -- they do some of that instant messaging things that -- that's almost -- it's almost like talking on a telephone.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because you just type in your thing and they respond back to you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and she carries on a conversation, talks about cruises and different things that people are doing and -- and summer vacation --
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- and it's pretty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- neat that -- and I -- and I -- and I guess that I -- I do it, true, but I guess a lot of that activity and knowledge --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of what to do is fr- from their -- both their home computer use plus what they learn in school.  And -- and having --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a -- a knowledge of the different types of products and stuff that are available.  [SIGH] I -- I think all that's important.
R:  Mhm. [NOISE] That's my daughter, just started talking on the phone --
L:  Yes, she's -- she's having fun talking to you, yeah.
R:  -- because I am talking on the -- yeah.  She's -- they are so loud. [LAUGH] I'm sorry.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's no problem.  But I was trying to think what else to talk about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because I think we're both in a -- in agreement, pretty much, that -- that probably computers can be a real positive.
R:  Yeah.  But you know what?  
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  I know that when my son was two, my husband allowed him to start drawing on the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, there was a moment that he would not use paper and stuff to -- just the mouse and the screen and I didn't like it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, you know, I had that impression that, you know, once he won't have electricity, that tide[?] is lost.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Bec- -- you -- you really have to balance it out.  It -- it cannot be actually -- it -- computers are [inaudible] but we have to make sure that they still know basic skills.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, we don't -- we don't use just computers.
L:  Right.  I understand what you're saying there 'cause, ah, some people would be lost if they didn't have a calculator or something else, so it is good to have basic math skills and other types of things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] That they can do.  And, like you said, to work on penmanship and stuff so that they can actually write, so somebody can read it 'cause, I mean, it's a point[?] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, because I'm a bad one to talk because sometimes I'm in a hurry, I write so that no one can write my handwriting anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, but the working on those types of skills, too, is -- is, you know, it does -- we don't want to -- you wouldn't want the one just to offset the other way, never.  Never a [inaudible]. 
R:  And I wonder h- how the grammar is -- will be affected, like in the future.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because now we have that spell checking, that you can, you know, as you type --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and some verbs are automatically corrected --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so you don't even know that you typed it in incorrectly.
L:  Incorrectly.  Right.
R:  And I just wonder, you know, because it is fairly new.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We have it, maybe, like ten years or so.  I don't think we have it longer.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I wonder, you know, how our -- the basic language and all that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Ah --
