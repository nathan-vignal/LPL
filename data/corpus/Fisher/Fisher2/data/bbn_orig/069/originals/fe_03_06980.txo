L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yeah, this is Kathy Gregory.
R:  I'm Rachel Kennedy.
L:  And where are you from?
R:  North Carolina.
L:  Oh, well, I'm going to be there actually in a -- 
R:  Where're you -- where --
L:  -- couple of weeks.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Indiana.  [MN] 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  My aunt has a place in Boston Grove.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so we're going to go take a vacation and visit her for a little bit.
R:  You ever been there?
L:  No, actually.
R:  Ah, north Carolina's a beautiful state.
L:  I've been to north Carolina.  I've been to Myrtle Beach.
R:  That's south Carolina. 
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] --  
L:  Well, then I've not been to north Carolina.
R:  [LAUGH] You must come through north Carolina.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, what do you think of computers in education?
L:  Oh, I think they're a necessity myself.
R:  Oh, I do too.
L:  [MN] Ah, I don't know how my kids would have gotten through a lot of their high school years without having the ability to look stuff up on line and do some of their research at home as opposed to having to stay at school for so long.
R:  I know.  I wish we'd had it when I was growing up.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, exactly.  And I -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- even find it useful now even as an adult to find things and, um -- 
R:  You -- you can look up anything.
L:  Yes, you can.
R:  Medical or just curiosity [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- something.  I think it's very important.
L:  And my grand kids come over and use this one too and, ah, because I have a high speed -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- connection so they like it 'cause it looks things up faster.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, I don't know that, ah, if you did away with internet, that these kids would be able to do as much of their homework at home as they do now.
R:  Yeah, that's true too.
L:  But, ah, do you have children?
R:  No, huh, I never had any.  But, ah -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I have a lot of nieces and nephews and a lot of friends' children, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I know how that works too.  Do -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- you, ah, have a computer at home?  [MN] -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I have a computer at home.  Like, ah, I'm lost without it. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  A while back it kind of -- I lost -- my modem messed up so I just [several inaudible words] my little computer.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, sometimes it's [LAUGH] about as cheap as, truthfully speaking, or -- 
R:  Well, it was time anyway.  I've had that about five years so it was time -- 
L:  It was time.
R:  -- to get another one.  I -- I was lost without it, you know?
L:  Yes, I -- we were without one here.  As a matter of fact I just replaced the monitor on the one [several inaudible words] it was still in good shape but the monitor was fading and you -- it was hard on your eyes to sit in front of it for any length of time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we had to do that and then I have -- my son got a new computer when he graduated and so they take that to -- to college with them and that helps them in -- at college because they use their, um, internet to do some of their research in their college dorm rooms.  So -- 
R:  That's good.  Do -- do children -- do all the children have access to computers now, do you know, in school, in the -- 
L:  In school I think they do.  Um, I don't know how much access they have to it.  I know they even start 'em in elementary school anymore te- teaching them how to use the internet and, um, what internet safety is and -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- of course you know it's -- it's hard with kids.  Parents need to be really involved with them because they sometimes get on to sites whether it be -- 
R:  That's the only bad part -- 
L:  -- accidentally or -- 
R:  -- yeah.
L:  But -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- you can buy protective, ah, software so you can limit what your kids do.  You can lock out certain websites.  I'm not sure what, ah, some of it's free, some of it has some cost to it but if you had to worry about your kids looking at things they shouldn't be looking at, I think it'd be beneficial. 
R:  It's not so much that is, ah, these chat rooms scare me for kids -- 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  You know, 'cause they have a way of getting information out of kids.  Even an adult -- you don't -- you don't even realise you're telling them what you're telling them.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't go in the chat rooms myself.
L:  Ah, no.  I've, um, have AOL service.  Sometimes I do instant message but usually just with people I know I've had -- 
R:  Oh, yeah -- yeah I do that but I had -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- when I first got it -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, I thought I'm going to try this chat room, you know, and I thought, "My gosh" and then you get all this porno, you know -- 
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] I know it.
R:  All these emails coming even porno- pornographic emails.
L:  Well, then you get people asking you --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- questions that it's like, "Where is that coming [LAUGH] from?"
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] And -- 
R:  I hated it.
L:  -- then I just click out of it and -- 
R:  I just don't -- 
L:  -- move on.
R:  -- get in chat rooms anymore.
L:  No, it's really, I don't think, a h- healthy atmosphere.  There's -- 
R:  No, I don't know -- 
L:  -- other -- 
R:  -- what they're talking about [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- at the time.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it's -- it's whether -- better to stay away from it, I think, than it is to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get into it.  Of course, a lot of people meet their spouses or you know, dating partners or whatever on the internet.  But, I'm still a little weary about that too.  So -- 
R:  I've actually known people who, um, met their husbands.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, something like that would be awful.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, it's really hard anymore, I mean, no one -- you usually don't want to meet someone in a bar and sometimes your churches are so full of married couples it's hard to meet someone at church.  So -- 
R:  Yeah, it's true too.
L:  But, even in the work force, then you don't want to get involved in a relationship with someone at work because that can tend to be a little tricky at times.  So, but I think with, um, the education in -- in the computer system, I think that's probably one of the wisest things that they did is to create a portable computer so people at home can buy them.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's good in schools.  Um, I think, it's really great.
L:  Yeah, I do too.  I, um -- so, where in, um, north Carolina do you live?
R:  I live in Pentacle[?].
L:  And where is that located?
R:  You know where Mount Airy[?] is?
L:  No, is it -- [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Home of -- home of Andy Griffiths.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, I'm right ab- about twenty miles below that.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  So, are you close to the south end, east, west, what portion -- 
R:  About [several inaudible words] middle.
L:  Okay.
R:  Closer to the mountains though.
L:  Okay.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Do you know where Boston Grove is?
R:  No, I don't.  What's it close to?
L:  Well, actually they -- they call the place -- it's kind of a church retreat.
R:  Is it in the mountains?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Boston Grove -- 
L:  It's -- it's called Living Waters the place where the church retreat is.  But, this whole town's called Boston Grove.
R:  Mm -- 
L:  I'm not sure what it's close to.  But, my mom said it's on the Blue Ridge Mountain.
R:  Oh, it's beau- -- I know where that is.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  That Blue Ridge is beautiful.  A beautiful mountain.
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm -- I'm looking forward to it.  Ah, like I said, I've not been there before.  I've been to the mountains in Tennessee but never been to the ones in north Carolina.  But, we normally go to the beach on vacations but this time we're going to try something different.
R:  The Blue Ridge -- they're old mountains, but they're pretty.  I mean, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Well -- 
R:  It can -- it can be kind of boring going up and down [LAUGH] there.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It really can.
L:  Yeah, I think it's -- 
R:  I depends -- 
L:  -- that's -- 
R:  Some [inaudible] now, they have things to look at but then there's some stretches in there that are really boring.  Yeah.
L:  What, are the roads in pretty good shape and -- 
R:  Oh, yeah.  The roads are fine.
L:  Oh, good.  Good.  So, do you work outside the home?
R:  Mm, I work at a library sometimes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Library.  My husband let me quit work.
L:  Well, that's wonderful.  How did you get involved in this program?
R:  Oh, I did some mystery shopping and -- and it was on our site.
L:  Yeah.  That's what I do as well, so that's how I got involved with it too.
R:  Yeah.  How do you like the -- do you do a lot of that?
L:  I have done in the past.  I've not -- 
R:  [COUGH] 
L:  -- qu- -- done quite as much, ah, recently because I've been real busy and of course it's an expensive undertaking.  I mean, you end up getting your money back but -- 
R:  Yeah, you have to -- 
L:  -- it ta- takes some -- 
R:  -- up front the money.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.  It takes some -- 
R:  And it's not -- it doesn't pay that much really.
L:  No.  And then I have to travel sometimes in a hundred miles or better -- 
R:  Really?
L:  -- to get to certain places 'cause the town I live in, they have some secret shops here but not as many as they do in the town close to me.  I live close to Indianapolis which is one of the larger cities close to us.  But, it's a good -- depending on where you go, it's a good hundred, two hundred miles round trip.  So, you're talking a good couple of hour drive or better.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that sometimes tends to be not as lucrative as you'd like for it to be.  But, I have done several here in the town I live in.  So -- so, those are the ones I like the most.  But, they're few and far between.  I did sign up for the survey site so I'm hoping to get some, um, surveys to have to do 'cause that would be real simple and easy because I can do those at home on the computer.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, did [several inaudible words] money [several inaudible words]?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the one I did too.  How about that?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] But, ah, but I like, ah, I liked it.  I signed up for it on a whim actually and then I enjoyed doing 'em and -- and then you get paid for it as well.  So, it's kind of nice.  Sometimes you can buy something and get reimbursed for it and get to keep what you buy.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is hard --  
L:  Sometimes it gets me in trouble though -- 
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Really?
L:  I go to places and I probably spend more than I really need to.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And you only get reimbursed for up to a certain dollar amount and it's -- 
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  But, ah, and -- have -- were you born and raised in north Carolina?
R:  Oh, yeah.  But, I've lived in California and Los Vegas and been in the army.  I've done -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- a lot of different things.
L:  Did you like Los Vegas?
R:  Yeah, I loved it.
L:  What part of California were you in?
R:  [COUGH] I lived in LA for a while and then in the -- the Bay area for a while.
L:  Okay.  My daughter's going to go out there next month and spend a month with a friend of hers in San Francisco.
R:  I loved San Francisco.
L:  Yeah, so I -- 
R:  Just so -- so many people though.
L:  Yes.  Los Angeles, I think, would probably be scarier for me than San Francisco.
R:  Oh, yeah, I think, ah, the northern part to me was nice, but the people were nicer.  I mean, you could go through the streets and people would be real courteous on the road, you know? 
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  But, um, LA now, and it's a kind of scary place.
L:  Yes.  You hear a lot of scary things about it.
R:  I wasn't real pleased with the place.
