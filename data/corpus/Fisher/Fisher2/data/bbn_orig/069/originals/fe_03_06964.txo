L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Rose.
R:  Oh, Rose.  My name is Jack and --
L:  Jack, nice to meet you.
R:  Oh, okay.  Glad to meet you.  And I understand our topic for today is computers?
L:  And edu- -- and, ah, how -- whether it helps or hurts education.
R:  Oh.
L:  Right?
R:  Ah, mm, good tha- --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Don't know how much I know about that, ah, I guess some kids, ah, say they're [inaudible] ah, do well with that and, of course, it, ah, allows them to explore a wide range of subjects, ah, then some --
L:  Do you use a computer much?
R:  -- kids say it helps them learn, you know, multiplication, division of basics -- basic math skills and vocabulary.
L:  Right.  Do you use a computer much, yourself?
R:  Ah, not very often.  I -- I go to the library and, ah, have my email there and check out some things there.  But I'm not quite tech, sadly enough, I -- somebody gave me some used equipment some time ago and I've known enough to even get it set up myself. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Got a friend who's coming over, ah, one of these days to help me get it started.  Don't know why I haven't been able to do it myself.  But, ah --
L:  So, you mainly use it for -- for the Internet for email?
R:  Email, yes, although that was just recently set up by a friend of mine and, ah, but also, um, I -- I'm kinda retired and, ah, so I, ah, check out various investments with it.
L:  Oh.
R:  And also my library, ah, usage.
L:  Okay.  So --
R:  Although I'm not completely retired.  I actually have to- two jobs but, ah, well, anyway, that's a long story.
L:  Oh [LAUGH]. 
R:  Are you -- you a big u- -- ah, computer user yourself?
L:  Ah, I'm a writer.  I'm a full time writer --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so, I use the computer exclusively for, you know, writing my articles and books and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I also, you know, go into Internet to do all my research --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, everything revolves around the computer, for me.
R:  Mm.  So, it's really vital to your work?
L:  Um, yes.  I -- I mean, I -- I remember writing reports on, um, on a, ah, a, ah, ah, a typewriter --
R:  Yes, that's how I--
L:  -- you know, and -- and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- used to do it when I was in college.
L:  Yeah, and nowadays, yeah, yeah, nowadays, now that I'm use- used to using a computer and being able to edit things right then and there --
R:  Mm.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I think back and go, "Man, you know, how did people do it on [LAUGH] -- on a regular old typewriter?"
R:  Spell check.  Well, one of the things I did when I was in college was type reports for other kids, ah, occasionally and, ah, of course, you had the little white out stuff or other stuff so you could change when you made an error, if it wasn't too -- too large.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But, of course, over time, your -- your skills, um, developed a little bit so that you didn't make too many errors, but I'm sure with these things it's a great thing.  It's -- it's a little complicated to learn all the different, ah, ah, mechanisms to do that.  I've taken some courses at the library to get that but then I don't get, ah, back to it or cl- -- soon enough or use it often enough --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to really become skilled at it.  I think, you know, if you do it regularly, well, like anything, it's like a language.  If you use it fine, and if you don't use it, then that's a problem. 
L:  Well, at least you, ah, you -- at least you take some classes and get into it.  My mom had the hardest time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just, ah, using a mouse, you know, she doesn't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- get how to, like, move the mouse and that.  You know, moving the mouse will -- will move the pointer [LAUGH] around --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- on the screen.
R:  But you have to know the right boxes to go to and just what they mean and -- and until you've known all that stuff and that's -- that's like a language itself --
L:  Ah, ah, okay.  Yeah, that -- that -- it's real interesting for me to hear it from another point of view, I [LAUGH] -- so, yeah.  But, um, as for how helpful it is for education --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's -- it's a tool like any other --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so, if you know how to use it, it's great.  If you don't know how to use it, um, I guess it's not so useful.
R:  Yeah.  Well, one of the -- I ha- -- of the two jobs that I have, one of them is scoring standardized tests that kids write.
L:  Oh.
R:  And in this work I've been reading, um, hundreds of essays, kids writing something about a most admired teacher.  And one of the things that's come up, occasionally, is that they -- the teacher tells them how to use it or helps them with it, and that they do find it useful.  I've never yet had one, ah, kid who say their teacher pushed them too hard on the computer or that they didn't know how to use it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I'm sure that's possible, of course, they're supposed to be- -- speak positively about the teacher --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, ah, then the negatives --
L:  Is this --
R:  -- might not come out. But, anyway --
L:  Just a --
R:  -- there are occasional references to how helpful it is.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just out of my own curiosity now, are these essays for high school or -- or college?
R:  Well, these are tenth graders.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  At that -- that age, that -- that's the ones I'm reading now but I also, ah, taught a class, a junior high class sex education course over the last several months and those kids are just really into email and wouldn't even think about touching a report without the computer.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  These are generally pretty well off, so they've got computers at home and -- and can use 'em and -- and do, you know, whatever they need to with 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't think, ah, any of 'em would do [LAUGH] -- do it any other way.
L:  I -- I miss letters, actually.  People -- everyone just sends emails to me now.  I -- I haven't gotten, like, an actual letter --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in -- in a long time.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I -- I communicate with my family some, that way although, I, um, dro- -- ah, well, I have two sisters and they both live several hundred miles from here, so I sent the one my new mail -- email address and haven't heard from her that way.  I expect probably hard mail one of these days [LAUGH] but either way might happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In fact, I tried to get on at the library tonight but for some or- other the person who had been using it +before came up.  Ah, my name is not Christian, obviously, and --
L:  Oh, whoops.
R:  -- and that's what kept bouncing back at me and I tried to cancel out and get back in but it wouldn't let me do that.  So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  Curious thing.
L:  Yeah, that is weird.
R:  But these things happen once in a while.  I mean, maybe the computer was sort of stuck, although I could check out all the stocks on it and that was helpful.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And, as a student, well, I'm not a student -- so much a student myself, but as a student of the stock market, it's helpful and you can research a lot of information that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, I had thought about going back to school and, ah, getting a masters degree and -- and I h- hesitated at that time, probably because they said, "Oh, the -- the, ah, curriculum, the whole thing, the -- the, ah, is on the -- on the web at the certain site" [LAUGH] and I thought, "Well, I'm not even going to be able to get on that", at the time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because I didn't, ah, have the -- the email stuff I've got now and so I wasn't even sure how I would do that.  Get the, ah, all the information, the syllabus and so forth.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  So, at that -- at that time I hesitated.  I don't know now about that but, ah, well, anyway [LAUGH]. 
L:  Well, no -- no.  It's -- it's really interesting to me.  I -- I also am curious, and forgive me if -- if I'm -- I'm prying, but I'm -- I'm curious as to how essays are scored?  How do you -- you mentioned that you grade standardized tests but you also grade essays?
R:  That's right.  Well, they give us, ah, a week's training on this.  We have a six point scale on this particular one and then, within that, they're scored according to both the sup- -- the amount of support that children write for the essay, and how they're organized, and focus and those sort of things.
L:  Mm.
R:  Those are the main criteria that we have.  So, I mean --
L:  Do you, ah --
R:  -- a kid that says, "Well, I like Mrs. Smith.  She's a really nice teacher and she's nice because she gives us lots of parties".  That's kinda one type of answer.  It's only a low level thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But if they give a little more support of her -- what they're meaning by nice or funny or what have you, and then they can get to a two, and if they do a little more then they get some -- a three, and so forth and they have to kinda fill up about a page to get, ah, to a three or a four score and have to do more than that and use a, you know, some good vocabulary to get up to a five or six score.
L:  Mm.  And -- and with the standardized testing, ah, don't -- aren't computers used to -- to score that?
R:  Well, no, because these are essays, ah, we have people --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- doing these.  But, with that -- the way the computers come in on this is that, ah, they give us, um, ah, well, we bubble in all our answers.  That is, you know, I get the -- a number for the kid.  I have no -- I have no idea of the kid's name --
L:  Right.
R:  -- don't need that.  But, I, you know, I bubble in a number one, two, three, four, five, six and -- and on these different criteria, and then that is taken, ah, by our company and, at the end of a day, so then -- tomorrow, um, I can look up or they -- thy -- my boss knows just how many I gave a one or a two or a three or a four or a five or a six, how that compares with the other ninety seven we've got working on that project, and so we are measured too.  And, ah, and, you know, to keep us online, or to say, "Well, you know, you -- you scored lower a little more often than other people, or higher", and so the computer really helps us gather all that information.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And -- and, ah, so it really comes in even on the scoring function as well as the kids and their, ah, composing function.
L:  Right.  So to maintain a uniformity in the judging --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they compare your scores with everyone else's?
R:  Yeah.  It's in -- of course, it's a tough thing because if you've got thirty seven or ninety seven or more different people, well, of course we're going to have a little different mind --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- here and there.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, with this -- this computer technique and the information coming back, it helps get your, you know, with a discipline on that a little bit. 
L:  Uh-huh.  I, ah, ah, I -- I judge for a screenplay writing competition --
R:  Mhm.  Good.
L:  -- and -- and the contest coordinators are always having a difficult time, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- coordinating everyone, you know, you know, seven out of ten ch- -- meaning there's seven out of ten for everyone but it never works out that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so it, ah, it's real interesting to me to f- -- you know, try to find out, you know, how do we solve this problem, how we standardize the scoring.
R:  Mhm.  Well, one thing I, ah --
