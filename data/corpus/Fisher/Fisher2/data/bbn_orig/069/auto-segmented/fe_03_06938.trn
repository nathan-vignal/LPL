AND AND THAT'S WHERE I WORK IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT'S JUST THE MOST IMPORTANT PLACE EVEN FOR THE FIRST GRADERS WE START WITH FIRST GRADERS AND GO ON UP SO  (fe_03_06938-A-0008)

THINGS LIKE THAT SO THERE ARE PROGRAMS AROUND HERE AS WELL GEARED AT GETTING MORE COMPUTERS INTO THE SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06938-A-0068)
