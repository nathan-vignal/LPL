NOT REALLY  (fe_03_06935-A-0030)
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY I DON'T IN  (fe_03_06935-A-0031)
REALLY THE GAMES THAT THEY LEARN  (fe_03_06935-A-0032)
IT'S IT'S EASIER FOR THE PARENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY THERE WITH THEM THE WHOLE TIME  (fe_03_06935-A-0033)
YOU KNOW EVEN THE EDUCATION ONES THAT UM THE READING  (fe_03_06935-A-0034)
THE COMPUTER READS THE STORY FOR THEM  (fe_03_06935-A-0035)
YOU KNOW AND THEY THEY CAN READ THE STORY AS IT GOES ALONG TOO SO THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO READ AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT TAKES AWAY I GUESS FROM THE PARENT OR A TEACHER DOING THAT TOO WITH THE KID  (fe_03_06935-A-0036)
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES PARENTS DON'T HAVE TIME  (fe_03_06935-A-0037)
TO SIT THERE FOR AN HOUR AND READ BOOKS AND TEACH YOU DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT  (fe_03_06935-A-0038)
YOU KNOW READING  (fe_03_06935-A-0039)
SO I MEAN THEY DO LEARN A LOT FROM THE COMPUTER I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD CONSIDER THEM COUCH POTATOES BECAUSE OF IT SOME KIDS YEAH BUT I I GUESS MY KIDS NO  (fe_03_06935-A-0040)
YEAH AND AND I KNOW TOO THAT EVEN AS AN ADULT WHERE IT'S THE COMPUTER BASED TRAINING  (fe_03_06935-A-0042)

YOU KNOW TO SEE THAT YOU REALLY RETAINED OR EVEN GOT ANYTHING OUT OF THE TRAINING  (fe_03_06935-A-0045)
'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN JUST CLICK UNTIL THEY GET TO THE END AND THEN THEY'RE DONE YOU KNOW AS AS FAR AS IF IT'S A REQUIREMENT FOR SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_06935-A-0046)
MHM  (fe_03_06935-A-0047)
MHM  (fe_03_06935-A-0048)

YOU KNOW IF YOU WANNA GO OUT TO LUNCH YOU CAN GO DO THAT AND COME BACK AND DO YOUR TRAINING  (fe_03_06935-A-0053)

AND YOU ALWAYS FEEL THAT EITHER THE CLASS IS GOING TOO FAST OR USUALLY TOO SLOW BECAUSE IT IT JUST TAKES ONE PERSON TO SAY THAT OH YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU CLICK YOUR MOUSE AND THE WHOLE CLASS COMES TO A STOP  (fe_03_06935-B-0015)
