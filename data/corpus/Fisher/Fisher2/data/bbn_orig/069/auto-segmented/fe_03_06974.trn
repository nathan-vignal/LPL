MHM  (fe_03_06974-A-0014)
DON'T YOU THINK THEY'LL STILL USE BOOKS ALSO IN SCHOOLS  (fe_03_06974-A-0015)
I FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND WE STILL USED BOOKS  (fe_03_06974-A-0016)
WELL I MEAN UNLESS THAT HAS IT HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST LIKE FOUR YEARS I THINK THEY STILL USE BOOKS  (fe_03_06974-A-0017)

[LIPSMACK] OH YEAH AND ALSO AH IT MIGHT BE HARD LIKE IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE  (fe_03_06974-A-0020)
TO EXPLAIN TO THEM YOU KNOW THE COMPUTER WON'T PROBABLY BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THEY DID WRONG AND WHERE THEY MADE THE MISTAKE  (fe_03_06974-A-0021)

UM WELL AH I DON'T KNOW I KIND OF LIKE WASN'T TOO MUCH INTO COMPUTERS BUT WE WERE KIND OF LIKE FORCED TO USE THEM BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_06974-A-0029)
TEACHERS WOULD EXPECT YOU TO AH LIKE YOU KNOW TYPE UP PAPERS AND ON THE COMPUTER AND TO USE THE INTERNET AS LIKE A SOURCE  (fe_03_06974-A-0030)
AND I WASN'T QUITE TOO MUCH INTO THAT NOW I'M MORE INTO COMPUTERS THAN WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL AS A MATTER OF FACT WHENEVER I HAD PAPERS DUE I HIRED SOMEBODY  (fe_03_06974-A-0031)
TO TYPE THEM FOR ME I JUST WROTE THEM BY HAND AND I PAID SOMEBODY TO DO IT BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT  (fe_03_06974-A-0032)
SO UM BUT UM NOW I'M MORE INTO IT AND I YOU KNOW ONCE YOU GET TO TO LEARN HOW TO USE THEM  (fe_03_06974-A-0033)
[LIPSMACK] I THINK THEY MAKE IT EASIER ON YOU WAY EASIER ON YOU  (fe_03_06974-A-0034)

WHEN I WANTED TO AH DOWNLOAD AND YOU KNOW CO- COMPILE MY OWN C._D.S IT WAS JUST EASIER TO DO IT ON THE INTERNET  (fe_03_06974-A-0039)
THAN ACTUALLY BUYING SO MANY DIFFERENT C._D.S  (fe_03_06974-A-0040)
NO NOT REA- WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS QUITE UNSATISFIED I WAS UM  (fe_03_06974-A-0042)

MORE INFORMATION ON IT A- AND I WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTED I AH WENT TO UM WHAT WAS IT GOOGLE OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_06974-A-0044)
AND AH I TYPED IN AH THE PROCEDURE AND THE MATERIAL AND UM  (fe_03_06974-A-0045)
IT I WAS  (fe_03_06974-A-0046)
[MN] THE INFORMATION WAS NOT VERY GOOD TO BE HONEST I  (fe_03_06974-A-0047)
YEAH IT WAS KIND OF MORE LIKE AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM DOCTORS THAT WAS THAT WERE OFFERING THAT PROCEDURE ANYWAY  (fe_03_06974-A-0048)
BUT YOU KNOW LIKE REALLY LIKE IN INFORMATIONAL ARTI- ARTICLE I DIDN'T FIND MAYBE I DIDN'T LOOK YOU KNOW LONG ENOUGH  (fe_03_06974-A-0049)
YEAH SO I I THINK YEAH I THINK AH YOU KNOW THE INTERNET LIKE ONCE YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND WHERE TO GO  (fe_03_06974-A-0050)
IT WILL MAKE YOUR EDUCATION AND ALL YOUR RESEARCH LIKE EASIER LIKE THAT'S WHAT I FOUND OUT WITH MUSIC LIKE AT FIRST WHEN I WAS AH LOOKING FOR SONGS AND YOU KNOW TRYING  (fe_03_06974-A-0051)
UM IT TOOK ME SO LONG AND YOU KNOW LIKE EVERY SIMPLE STEP WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME  (fe_03_06974-A-0052)
BUT NOW THAT I'M I'M GO- YOU KNOW I'M I'M KIND OF LIKE FAMILIAR WITH IT E- EVERYTHING IS JUST QUICK QUICK QUICK  (fe_03_06974-A-0053)
SO BUT THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IF KIDS GROW GROW UP WITH IT UM I THINK IT MAKES EVERYTHING WAY EASIER ON THEM  (fe_03_06974-A-0054)
YEAH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WE HAD A UM A OUR FINAL YEAR THERE WAS THE ONE AH RESEARCH PAPER EVERYBODY HAD TO DO AND IT WAS A LOT OF WORK IT TOOK ABOUT LIKE TWO OR THREE WEEKS OF WORK  (fe_03_06974-A-0055)
AND UM IT IT IT COUNTED AS LIKE ONE SEMESTER OF A GRADE SO IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND UM SOME STUDENTS DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THEMSELVES AND THEY JUST KIND OF LIKE BOUGHT ONE ON THE INTERNET FROM SOMEBODY ELSE  (fe_03_06974-A-0056)
SO YEAH SOME STUDENTS DID THAT LIKE SOMEBODY WHO HAD RECEIVED LIKE AN A OR A B.  (fe_03_06974-A-0057)
AND THEY JUST BOUGHT IT AND THEY JUST PRINTED IT OUT AND SAID IT WAS THEIRS AND AND TURNED IT IN  (fe_03_06974-A-0058)
SO YEAH I KNOW THAT HAPPENS  (fe_03_06974-A-0059)
NOT SUPPOSED TO I KNOW  (fe_03_06974-A-0060)
YEAH YEAH YEAH USUALLY THEY DID OR AT LEAST YOU KNOW LIKE AN OKAY GRADE BUT IT SAVED THEM A LOT OF YOU KNOW BECAUSE  (fe_03_06974-A-0061)
AVERAGE TIME FOR PA- FOR THIS AH IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A A MAJOR PAPER AVERAGE TIME WAS LIKE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR WEEKS OF WORK SO THAT WAS A LOT OF TIME  (fe_03_06974-A-0062)
AND YEAH THEY DID THAT AND I ALSO HEARD THAT SOME AH DOCTOR HOW DO YOU SAY IT WHEN SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BECOME A DOCTOR THEY NEED TO WRITE A CERTAIN PAPER  (fe_03_06974-A-0063)
IN ORDER TO GET THAT DOCTOR'S CERTIFICATION OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_06974-A-0064)

YEAH THEY NEED TO UM AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY NEED TO WRITE A CERTAIN AH PAPER AND I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT SOME PEOPLE LIKE AH WILL BUY BUY THESE PAPERS  (fe_03_06974-A-0066)
I'M NOT SURE BUT A- YOU KNOW I'M SURE IF IT'S POSSIBLE SOME PEOPLE WILL DO IT  (fe_03_06974-A-0067)
THE ONLY WAY I FOUND THE COMPUTER VERY GOOD IS IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR AH INFORMATION ON CERTAIN PEOPLE LIKE AH BACKGROUND SEARCHING  (fe_03_06974-A-0069)
OR IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR CREDITS LIKE IF YOU IF SOMEBODY CLAIMS THEY HAVE CERTAIN CREDITS AND YOU CHECK IT YOU CHECK THEIR REFERENCES  (fe_03_06974-A-0070)
I ALWAYS DO THAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06974-A-0071)
SO E- I FOUND THIS VERY UM  (fe_03_06974-A-0072)
I FOUND THIS VERY GOOD  (fe_03_06974-A-0073)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06974-A-0074)
HELLO MY NAME IS BOB  (fe_03_06974-B-0001)

[LIPSMACK] WELL LET'S SEE I'M FAIRLY COMPUTER PROFICIENT AH YOU KNOW WITH EMAIL AND EBAY AND THE OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I I DO WONDER  (fe_03_06974-B-0009)
I CERTAINLY THINK THE KIDS HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY KNOW HOW TO USE 'EM BECAUSE IT'S REQUIRED IN EVERY JOB  (fe_03_06974-B-0010)
BUT  (fe_03_06974-B-0011)
BUT WHETHER THEY'RE MISSING ANYTHING BY NOT READING BOOKS AH  (fe_03_06974-B-0012)
[LIPSMACK] WELL I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT I I GREW UP OF COURSE WITH ONLY BOOKS AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE YOU YOU MISS SOMETHING  (fe_03_06974-B-0013)
RIGHT I WAS THINKING ABOUT AH THESE AH COURSES OR WHAT HAVE YOU WHERE THEY TEACH THEM MATH YOU KNOW AND THEY CAN  (fe_03_06974-B-0014)
UM AND MAYBE THERE'S A GOOD POINT TO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY TRY TO SELL IT BY THE IDEA THEY CAN PROGRESS AT THEIR OWN SPEED YOU KNOW AND THEY GET THE TESTS ARE SCORED AUTOMATICALLY  (fe_03_06974-B-0015)
AND I GUESS  (fe_03_06974-B-0016)
MHM [LIPSMACK] WELL I'M SURE THEY  (fe_03_06974-B-0017)

PARTICULARLY LET'S SAY FOR YOU KNOW THE EARLY GRADES WHERE THEY'RE JUST DOING ADDING AND SUBTRACTING  (fe_03_06974-B-0020)
IT'S SO EASY THAT I I THINK THEY COULD TEACH THEM THE WHOLE COURSE ON THE COMPUTER AND THEY WOULD NEVER NEVER SPEAK TO ANYBODY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD OR NOT  (fe_03_06974-B-0022)
THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE ALL THE COMPUTER DOES I THINK IS TO SEND THEM BACK YOU KNOW FOR MORE PRACTISE BEFORE THEY GO ON AND AND THEY COULD GET STUCK  (fe_03_06974-B-0023)
MHM  (fe_03_06974-B-0024)
YEAH THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE  (fe_03_06974-B-0025)
AH IF THE TEACHER IS REALLY GOOD IT IT MAKES PEOPLE  (fe_03_06974-B-0026)
IT GIVES SOMETHING THAT THAT AH BEYOND KNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW IT GIVES THEM THE THE AH MAYBE THE INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT WHERE THEY IF THEY CAN FIND A TEACHER THAT'S REALLY EXCITING  (fe_03_06974-B-0027)
