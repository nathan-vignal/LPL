WHERE ARE YOU  (fe_03_06957-A-0002)
[SIGH] OH MY HEAVENS  (fe_03_06957-A-0003)
WELL REGINA MY NAME IS BEV AND [LAUGHTER] I'M IN SOUTH GEORGIA JUST UH ABOVE THE FLORIDA BORDER  (fe_03_06957-A-0004)
SO WE HAVE GOT QUITE A DISTANCE TODAY [LAUGHTER] NO  (fe_03_06957-A-0005)
OKAY ALL THEY TOLD ME WHEN I CLICKED THAT I WOULD PARTICIPATE WAS THAT THE TOPIC WAS EDUCATION AND NOW I'VE JUST HEARD THAT IT'S COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION  (fe_03_06957-A-0006)
OKAY  (fe_03_06957-A-0007)
YES I'M A TEACHER  (fe_03_06957-A-0009)
I TEACH WHAT'S CALLED ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION I WORK WITH SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN AND I TAKE THEM TO P._E.  (fe_03_06957-A-0010)
AND MY HUSBAND IS A TEACHER AND HE TEACHES AUTO MECHANICS AT HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_06957-A-0011)
HOW ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_06957-A-0012)
OH [LAUGHTER] OKAY SO  (fe_03_06957-A-0013)
AND MY BEST FRIEND IS A TECHNOLOGY TEACHER IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SO [LAUGHTER] I GUESS THIS IS A GOOD SUBJECT FOR ME [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-A-0014)
I USE COMPUTERS I PERSONALLY USE COMPUTERS BUT IN MY PART OF THE OF WHAT I DO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE A COMPUTER  (fe_03_06957-A-0015)
BECAUSE I'M MINE IS AN ACTIVITY CLASS  (fe_03_06957-A-0016)
AND SOME  (fe_03_06957-A-0017)
[SIGH] SOME P._E. TEACHERS DO USE COMPUTERS TO DO UH FITNESS TESTING AND HAVE RESULT YOU KNOW COMPUTER BASED RESULTS AND THINGS [SIGH] BUT WHAT I DO WITH SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN IS HELP THEM TO FIT INTO THE REGULAR P._E. CLASS  (fe_03_06957-A-0018)
SO IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE [NOISE] FOR ME TO USE A COMPUTER BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE A COMPUTER IN THE CLASS THAT I HELP THEM FIT INTO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-A-0019)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_06957-A-0021)
WELL I CAN TELL YOU A VERY BAD EXAMPLE OF COMPUTERS MY SON TAKES UH WAS IN SIXTH GRADE THIS YEAR HE WAS IN WHAT'S CALLED ACCELERATED MATH  (fe_03_06957-A-0022)
THERE'S A COMPUTER PROGRAM FOR MATH THAT WAS DESIGNED TO BE AN ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM TO HELP THE CHILDREN HIS TEACHER USED IT AS THE CLASS  (fe_03_06957-A-0023)
THAT'S NOT YEAH SO THEY BASICALLY TAUGHT THEMSELVES  (fe_03_06957-A-0024)
AND THEY TOOK THE COMPUTER TESTS AND THEY AND DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THEY DID ON THE COMPUTER SHE GOT A REPORT ON HOW MUCH THEY UNDERSTOOD AND I'M NOT SURE THAT SHE EVER ACTUALLY TAUGHT A LESSON  (fe_03_06957-A-0025)
AND THAT'S MY OTHER DEGREE FIELD IS MATH AND I HAVE TAUGHT MATH THAT'S NOT MY PREFERRED FIELD BUT THAT'S MY DEGREE FIELD [LAUGHTER] TO GET A JOB  (fe_03_06957-A-0026)
BUT [SIGH] I KNOW THAT WITHOUT EVER TEACHING A LESSON I CAN'T IMAGINE THE CHILDREN TRYING TO TEACH THEMSELVES MATH  (fe_03_06957-A-0027)
THERE'S JUST SOME KIDS THAT AREN'T GOING TO GET IT HOW SOME ARE VISUAL LEARNERS AND SOME [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW ALL DIFFERENT TYPE OF LEARNING STYLE AND THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO BE  (fe_03_06957-A-0028)
PLUG IT IN THE COMPUTER AND YOU GOT IT  (fe_03_06957-A-0029)
SO THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE I HAVE OF IT BUT OTHER THAN THAT  (fe_03_06957-A-0030)
RIGHT [NOISE]  (fe_03_06957-A-0031)
RIGHT LIKE IN THAT THAT BAD EXAMPLE WHERE THE COMPUTER TEACHES THEM AND NOT THE TEACHER  (fe_03_06957-A-0032)
[NOISE] [NOISE] WELL I TELL YOU  (fe_03_06957-A-0034)
I TAUGHT SOME HIGH SCHOOL MATH AND  (fe_03_06957-A-0035)
OUR PRINCIPAL THAT WHEN I WAS OF COURSE THAT SEE MATH IS THE FIELD WHERE YOU ALWAYS GET IN YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET IN IN P._E. I MEAN YOU HAD TO WAIT AND TRANSFER WHEN YOU HAVE TENURE SO I'VE ONLY I'VE TAUGHT MANY MATH CLASSES AS WELL MY HUSBAND BEING MILITARY WE'VE BEEN TO SOME AREAS BUT ANYWAY [SIGH]  (fe_03_06957-A-0036)
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THIS PRINCIPAL CAME IN AND TOLD US THAT THE FAILURE RATE [NOISE] WAS TOO HIGH  (fe_03_06957-A-0037)
FOR THE NINTH GRADE CLASSES SO HE WANTED US ALL TO WORK ON THAT  (fe_03_06957-A-0038)
AND THE TEACHERS WERE ASKING DO YOU MEAN DROP OUR STANDARDS HE SAID DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THEM TO PASS DROP YOUR STANDARDS SO THE OTHER TEACHERS MADE UP THEIR OWN TEST NOW I GAVE THE BOOK OUT FOR THE TEST BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THEY KNEW  (fe_03_06957-A-0039)
IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN I GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY [NOISE] TO COME AFTER SCHOOL LEARN WITH ME AND AND RETAKE IT HOWEVER [SIGH] THAT BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET BEHIND YOU'RE ALWAYS BEHIND  (fe_03_06957-A-0040)
AND I GAVE THEM A SECOND BOOK TEST AND THEN I KNEW DO THEY KNOW THE ALGEBRA THE OTHER TEACHERS GAVE THEM  (fe_03_06957-A-0041)
[SIGH] A MATH WATERED DOWN LOTS OF QUESTIONS FROM THE FIRST SECTION WATERED DOWN TEST AND I SAID [NOISE] YOU KNOW MY STUDENTS AND MY OWN PERSONAL CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO TAKE THE WATERED DOWN S._A._T. TEST  (fe_03_06957-A-0042)
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SAY EXCUSE ME I NEED THAT TEST UH WHATEVER YOU NEED TO GIVE ME SO I GET A HIGH S._A._T. SCORE  (fe_03_06957-A-0043)
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF MATH I TOOK  (fe_03_06957-A-0044)
I THINK IT'S HAPPENING NATIONWIDE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS TEACHERS AND ANOTHER THING IS TEACHERS ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR IF THEIR STUDENTS PASS OR NOT SO THEY'RE MAKING THEM PASS AT WHATEVER  (fe_03_06957-A-0047)
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PASS BUT NOT MEETING THE STANDARD AND THEN WHEN THEY GO TO COLLEGE [LAUGHTER] THEY CAN'T DO IT  (fe_03_06957-A-0048)
MHM  (fe_03_06957-A-0049)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06957-A-0050)
RIGHT NOW IF THAT IS THEIR THEIR ONLY PROGRAM HOWEVER [LAUGHTER] IF THE TEACHER'S NOT TEACHING AND SUPPLEMENTING THIS IS WHERE I FIND A PROBLEM THEN THE KID WHO WORKS AT THEIR OWN PACE BY THE END OF THE YEAR MAY BE SIX MONTHS BEHIND  (fe_03_06957-A-0051)
AND THAT'S WHERE MY CHILD WAS YOU KNOW THEY THE TEACHER WAS LETTING THEM DO THEIR OWN THING  (fe_03_06957-A-0052)
AND [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH AND MY CHILD TESTED POST HIGH HE'S IN SIXTH FINISHED SIXTH GRADE AND TESTED POST HIGH SCHOOL MATH ON THE STANFORD NINE TEST  (fe_03_06957-A-0053)
HE STILL SCORED HIS HIGHEST SCORE IN MATH WAS AN EIGHTY THREE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T FINISH THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS SHE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO EVERY DAY  (fe_03_06957-A-0054)
BUT HE WAS HE WAS OKAY WITH THAT 'CAUSE HE WAS WORKING AT HIS OWN PACE HE WASN'T TOLD YOU NEED TO DO THIS THIS AND THIS  (fe_03_06957-A-0055)
HE JUST DID WHAT HE WANTED TO DO  (fe_03_06957-A-0056)
NOW AS I AND AS I SAID I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE I'VE GOT A CHILD WHO'S GOT A MATH TALENT  (fe_03_06957-A-0057)
WHO'S NOT WORKING TO HIS POTENTIAL  (fe_03_06957-A-0058)
RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-A-0059)
SO BUT AGAIN THIS IS THEY THINK THAT THIS IS THE  (fe_03_06957-A-0060)
THEY GOT A BIG GRANT FOR ALL THIS ACCELERATED MATH AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A GRANT  (fe_03_06957-A-0061)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-A-0062)
SO BUT NOW ONE SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE A TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM FOR THE CHILDREN THAT THEY GO TO P._E. MUSIC AND TECHNOLOGY  (fe_03_06957-A-0063)
AND THE TECHNOLOGY I THINK THAT THIS THOSE [NOISE] THIS IS WHERE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO BE RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO USE THE COMPUTER WITH THE RIGHT WAY TO TURN IT ON TURN IT OFF TO YOU KNOW WHAT  (fe_03_06957-A-0064)
SHORTCUTS FOR THIS AND HOW TO PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE LEARNING A LOT OF THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN USE  (fe_03_06957-A-0065)
IN REAL LIFE  (fe_03_06957-A-0066)
AND I THINK THAT SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE REALLY CAUGHT ON NOW SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVEN'T CAUGHT ON YET [LAUGHTER] AND THEY'RE JUST THE TEACHERS HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AND THEY FROM TEACHING THEM HOW TO TURN ON THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_06957-A-0067)
YOU KNOW THE WE'VE GOT A TEACHER WHO'S DOING THAT AS A SUPPLEMENT THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TEACH WITH THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_06957-A-0068)
INSTEAD OF TEACHING THE COMPUTER [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-A-0069)
SO I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT SOME SCHOOLS HERE ARE DOING YOU KNOW WHO'VE CAUGHT ON TO SOME GOOD THINGS WITH TECHNOLOGY  (fe_03_06957-A-0070)
I WOULD BET THEY THAT [SIGH]  (fe_03_06957-A-0071)
OVER HALF MAYBE TWO THIRDS  (fe_03_06957-A-0072)
NOW HOW MUCH THE PARENTS WILL LET THEM USE THEM THAT'S ANOTHER STORY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-A-0073)
BECAUSE I THINK A GOOD MANY OF THEM HAVE A COMPUTER  (fe_03_06957-A-0074)
AS A MATTER OF FACT IF YOU SEE THEIR SCIENCE REPORTS OR THEIR SCIENCE FAIR PROJECTS  (fe_03_06957-A-0075)
MOST OF THEM ARE DONE ARE COMPUTER DONE  (fe_03_06957-A-0076)
I WOULD SAY UH AND A THIRD OF THEM ARE PARENT DONE BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY  (fe_03_06957-A-0077)
[LAUGHTER] BUT MOSTLY THERE ARE VERY FEW THAT HAVEN'T BEEN  (fe_03_06957-A-0078)
DONE ON THE COMPUTER AND PASTED TO THEIR SCIENCE REPORTS  (fe_03_06957-A-0079)
[NOISE] SO AGAIN I THINK THAT SOMEBODY'S GOT ACCESS WHETHER IT'S THE PARENTS OR THE PARENTS AT WORK  (fe_03_06957-A-0080)
MY OWN CHILDREN  (fe_03_06957-A-0081)
I HAVE THREE AND TWO OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN COMPUTERS THAT ARE HOOKED UP ONLINE  (fe_03_06957-A-0082)
AND THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T BECAUSE HE USED TO SHARE A ROOM WITH IT [NOISE] WITH ONE AND HE DIDN'T NEED IT [NOISE] NOW THAT WE'VE MOVED HE HAS HIS OWN ROOM AND HE HAS ACCESS TO THE OTHER TWO COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06957-A-0083)
BUT I REALLY THINK THAT A LOT MORE KIDS HAVE COMPUTER AT HOME THAN  (fe_03_06957-A-0084)
THAN THEY  (fe_03_06957-A-0085)
BUT AGAIN THE A LOT OF THE PARENTS DO THE PART THAT TURN IT ON HERE PROGRAM IT TAKE IT TO WHATEVER THEY WANT THEM TO DO AND THEN LET LET THEM GO SO THE KIDS 'CAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST THEM  (fe_03_06957-A-0086)
[NOISE] THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO MESS UP THE COMPUTER AND THEY'LL PROGRAM WHO KNOWS WHAT OR DOWNLOAD WHAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-A-0087)
RIGHT [LAUGHTER] RIGHT WELL I HAD A CHILD MY FOURTH GRADER  (fe_03_06957-A-0088)
THEY DOWNLOADED THAT BONSAI BUDDY THING  (fe_03_06957-A-0089)
WHICH IS A BAD THING IT'S A LITTLE MONKEY THAT TELLS THEM JOKES AND ALL SORT WELL THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS A REAL GOOD THING  (fe_03_06957-A-0090)
BUT IT IT ALSO SA-  (fe_03_06957-A-0091)
PUTS THEM ON ALL SORTS OF EMAIL LISTS AND YOU KNOW BEING WHEN THEY GO TO NICK AND ALL THAT THOSE KIND OF SITES THEY SIGN UP FOR THEY CAN PUT MAKE A PICTURE PUT A NOSE IN PUT A FA- MOUTH IN PUT A FACE IN IT  (fe_03_06957-A-0092)

I YEAH  (fe_03_06957-B-0028)
WELL WE CERTAINLY ARE [COUGH] ENTERING THE COMPUTER AGE AND EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO USE A COMPUTER BUT I HAVE PROBLEMS WHEN THE COMPUTERS BECOME THE CENTER UH THE STUDENT NEEDS TO BE THE CENTER UH  (fe_03_06957-B-0029)
YEAH  (fe_03_06957-B-0030)
YEAH  (fe_03_06957-B-0031)
UM  (fe_03_06957-B-0032)
I GUESS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO MIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW GOOD OR POOR THE TEACHER IS UH  (fe_03_06957-B-0033)
IN SOME CASES THE COMPUTER MIGHT BE A BETTER TEACHER I KNOW [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE MATH IS SUCH A STICKING POINT [COUGH] I JUST FINISHED COUNSELING A STUDENT WHO  (fe_03_06957-B-0034)
IS ENTERING COLLEGE IN THE FALL AND HE SCORED AT PRE COLLEGE MATH AND  (fe_03_06957-B-0035)
HE'S GOT A LOT OF EXTRA CLASSES TO TAKE TO GET UP TO SPEED FOR MATH AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LEARNING IT UM SO MANY OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE NOT LEARNING IT IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_06957-B-0036)
AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE TEACHERS WHO ARE EXPECTED TO TEACH IT IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MATH ISN'T THEIR THING AND THEY REALLY DON'T  (fe_03_06957-B-0037)
UM DO A GOOD JOB AT ALL IN FACT THEY TRAUMATIZE A LOT OF STUDENTS I'M AFRAID WITH MATH AND THEN AS TIME GOES ON MATH ISN'T A FAVORITE SUBJECT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SO IT KINDA GETS PUSHED ASIDE AND BY THE TIME THEY GET TO US  (fe_03_06957-B-0038)
IT'S REALLY TOUGH [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'VE MISSED ALL THAT STUFF IN THE MIDDLE  (fe_03_06957-B-0039)

[SIGH] WELL  (fe_03_06957-B-0056)
RIGHT ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT  (fe_03_06957-B-0057)
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS I KNOW THEY'VE GOT MATH PROGRAMS WRITTEN ON THE COMPUTER THAT ARE PROGRESSIVE LEARNING SO THEY GIVE YOU A PROBLEM AND IF YOU DON'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER THEY GIVE YOU ANOTHER PROBLEM AND THEY BREAK IT DOWN  (fe_03_06957-B-0058)
UNTIL YOU GET THE RIGHT ANSWER AND THEN IT MOVES ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL WE'RE USING THAT IN SOME OF OUR UM  (fe_03_06957-B-0059)
AREAS IN DEVELOPMENTAL MATH SO THAT THEY CAN PRACTISE AT THEIR OWN PACE  (fe_03_06957-B-0060)
[COUGH] AND GET IT SO THAT IS A THAT'S A BENEFIT I THINK OF OF HAVING IF IT'S A GOOD COMPUTER PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE STUDENT DOESN'T KNOW AND GIVE THEM EXTRA WORK IN THAT AREA IT RELIEVES THE TEACHER  (fe_03_06957-B-0061)
OH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06957-B-0062)
