EXCUSE ME  (fe_03_06939-A-0004)
OH YES YES  (fe_03_06939-A-0005)
YES IN MAINE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06939-A-0007)
YES WE ARE  (fe_03_06939-A-0008)
OKAY  (fe_03_06939-A-0009)
DO YOU HAVE COMPUTERS IN YOUR SCHOOL  (fe_03_06939-A-0011)
RIGHT BUT IN YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THERE DO YOU  (fe_03_06939-A-0012)
OKAY  (fe_03_06939-A-0013)
WELL OUR SCHOOL'S JUST STARTED AS PART OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT FUNDING THING LAST YEAR WHERE THEY GAVE LAPTOP COMPUTERS TO EVERY SEVENTH GRADER  (fe_03_06939-A-0014)
YES  (fe_03_06939-A-0015)
OF MAINE AND I WASN'T SURE IF IT WAS A FEDERAL GUIDELINE OR NOT  (fe_03_06939-A-0016)
I BELIEVE SO JUST FOR THE STATE OF MAINE I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OTHER STATES HAVE STARTED OR NOT  (fe_03_06939-A-0017)
OKAY  (fe_03_06939-A-0018)
WELL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVES AS FAR AS IT GIVES THE KIDS MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR  (fe_03_06939-A-0019)
RESEARCH AND THINGS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOW MORE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND THE WAY OUR SCHOOLS WORK IT HERE IS THEY GET THEIR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS YOU KNOW EMAILED TO THEM WHICH ALSO GIVES THE PARENTS THE OPTION OF SEEING IT VERSUS JUST LOSING IT WITH A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE WAY HOME  (fe_03_06939-A-0020)
UM THE OTHER PRO IS THAT THEY LEARN TO TYPE WHICH I THINK IS A HUGE  (fe_03_06939-A-0021)
BENEFIT THESE DAYS  (fe_03_06939-A-0022)
AND A LOT OF FAMILIES DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS SO IT GIVES THEM MORE OF A AN OPPORTUNITY THAN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE AS FAR AS THE CONS GO  (fe_03_06939-A-0023)
I DUNNO I THINK TO SOME POINT IT COULD MAKE THEM MORE LACKADAISICAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T GO  (fe_03_06939-A-0024)
READ AS MANY BOOKS AS THEY PROBABLY COULD HAVE BECAUSE THEY'RE PLAYING ONLINE  (fe_03_06939-A-0025)

RIGHT  (fe_03_06939-A-0029)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06939-A-0030)
RIGHT BECAUSE I IMAGINE A LOT OF FAMILIES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THINGS LIKE ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND AS MANY BOOKS AS AND THEN THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUE AS FAR AS GETTING YOUNG KIDS TO THE LIBRARIES AND THINGS WHEN YOU HAVE WORKING PARENTS NOW SO  (fe_03_06939-A-0031)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06939-A-0032)
GUESS THE ONLY THE ONLY REAL CON I'VE SEEN AROUND HERE IS THAT YOU GET THESE THESE COMPUTERS WHICH ARE LAPTOPS THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN GIVING OUT IS THAT YOU GET THE LAPTOPS IN THE HANDS OF THESE CHILDREN WHO THEN  (fe_03_06939-A-0034)
GO HOME AND IF THEY THE PARENTS AREN'T COMPUTER LITERATE OR HAVEN'T HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM  (fe_03_06939-A-0035)
UM THEY KINDA GET STUCK BECAUSE IF THEY NEED HELP OR ASSISTANCE THE FAMILIES AREN'T GETTING IT BUT YET THE FAMILIES DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT THE KIDS GET AT SCHOOL EITHER  (fe_03_06939-A-0036)
SO IT'S KINDA YOU'RE SENDING HOME THIS GREAT TECHNICAL DEVICE THAT  (fe_03_06939-A-0037)
MAY GET USED BUT MAY NOT GET USED BY SOME KIDS AS WELL  (fe_03_06939-A-0038)

RIGHT  (fe_03_06939-A-0048)
OH DEFINITELY  (fe_03_06939-A-0049)
RIGHT THE THING THE THING THAT WORRIES ME IS THAT  (fe_03_06939-A-0050)
YOU HAVE YOU HAVE CERTAIN STUDENTS IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT ARE GETTING OTHER THINGS I MEAN THEY'RE GETTING  (fe_03_06939-A-0051)
THESE TOP OF THE LINE EDUCATIONAL PIECES AND YOU HAVE SOME OTHER YOU KNOW AR- RURAL AREAS OR SMALLER TOWNS THAT WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE THINGS AND THEN  (fe_03_06939-A-0052)
HAPPENING IS YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THIS GRADUATING CLASS GOING OFF TO COLLEGE AND LOOKING FOR  (fe_03_06939-A-0053)
EMPLOYMENT AND THINGS AND IT JUST IT CONCERNS ME THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE FAR MORE ADVANTAGE OVER OTHERS BY HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE  (fe_03_06939-A-0054)
BY COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06939-A-0055)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06939-A-0056)

THE DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AND AREAS AND AND THINGS THAT ARE UP AND COMING THAT IT'S REALLY A LOT OF POSITIONS NOW YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE  (fe_03_06939-A-0058)
UM WHICH WHICH BOTHERS ME BECAUSE SOME KIDS CAN PICK UP THAT KNOWLEDGE FASTER THAN OTHERS  (fe_03_06939-A-0059)
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EDUCATION THROUGH THESE KIDS YOU KNOW GET EVERY KID WHAT THEY DESERVE THAT SOME MIGHT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND ALL BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE A COMPUTER WOULD HOLD THEM BACK FROM  (fe_03_06939-A-0060)
FROM LEARNING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE  (fe_03_06939-A-0061)

AS YOU YOU KNOW GROW AND YOU GET OLDER IN YOUR IN YOUR SCHOOL AGE AND STUFF  (fe_03_06939-A-0072)
THINGS GET MORE COMPLICATED AND AND WHEN YOU'RE STARTING THESE KIDS SO YOUNG AT COMPUTERS I MEAN I'M THEY'RE TONS OF THINGS I'VE BEEN USING COMPUTERS FOR YEARS BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WAS NEVER LEARN  (fe_03_06939-A-0073)

YOU KNOW JUST THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECT OF AH COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION WHAT'S YOUR AH TAKE ON IT  (fe_03_06939-B-0018)
AH  (fe_03_06939-B-0019)
WELL I I TEND TO AGREE WITH WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM  (fe_03_06939-B-0024)
UM  (fe_03_06939-B-0025)
YOU KNOW AH COMPUTER IN EDUCATION  (fe_03_06939-B-0026)
UM THE THING OF IT IS IS THAT UM OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN EASIER ACCESS  (fe_03_06939-B-0027)
AH COMPUTER OKAY  (fe_03_06939-B-0028)
BUT UM  (fe_03_06939-B-0029)
YOU KNOW ADMITTEDLY THE LACKADAISICAL PART IS IS NOT A POSITIVE THING  (fe_03_06939-B-0030)
BUT UM YOU COULD PROBABLY ACCESS  (fe_03_06939-B-0031)
MORE THINGS ON A COMPUTER THAN YOU COULD OTHERWISE I WOULD IMAGINE  (fe_03_06939-B-0032)
YEAH WELL I GUESS IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT IT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06939-B-0033)
UM PERHAPS THE PROS DO OUTWEIGH THE CONS AH IN THAT REGARD YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06939-B-0034)
FOR FOR AH COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION  (fe_03_06939-B-0035)
YEAH  (fe_03_06939-B-0036)
WELL THE OTHER THING THAT'S WORRISOME THOUGH FOR ME IS UM AUTOMATION  (fe_03_06939-B-0037)
WITH COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06939-B-0038)
IN OTHER WORDS AH  (fe_03_06939-B-0039)
YOU KNOW WORKING PEOPLE  (fe_03_06939-B-0040)
AND EDUCATION KINDA TIES INTO THAT  (fe_03_06939-B-0041)
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THIS WHOLE AGE IS GOING TO YOU KNOW THE FUTURE OF EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION  (fe_03_06939-B-0042)
THAT TYPE OF THING  (fe_03_06939-B-0043)
AND WHERE SOCIETY IS HEADED YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S RATHER WORRISOME BECAUSE  (fe_03_06939-B-0044)
FOR EXAMPLE  (fe_03_06939-B-0045)
AH AT THIS LAST JOB THEY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT AH COMPUTER AH ROBOTICS COULD NOT DO THE JOB INDIVIDUALS COULD  (fe_03_06939-B-0046)
AND UM SO THEY HAD TO DISCONTINUE THE AH ROBOTICS  (fe_03_06939-B-0047)
BUT AH  (fe_03_06939-B-0048)
YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S IT'S IT'S PART OF EDUCATION BECAUSE  (fe_03_06939-B-0049)
UM  (fe_03_06939-B-0050)
YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD TO BE EDUCATED BUT BUT AH  (fe_03_06939-B-0051)
YOU KNOW PEOPLE NEED TO DO THINGS YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING YOU DON'T WANNA ERADICATE  (fe_03_06939-B-0052)
INDIVIDUALS  (fe_03_06939-B-0053)
IN THE WORKPLACE  (fe_03_06939-B-0054)
OR EDUCATION WISE  (fe_03_06939-B-0055)
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A BAD THING WOULDN'T YOU AGREE  (fe_03_06939-B-0056)
SO  (fe_03_06939-B-0057)
I I'M I'M PRETTY MUCH FOR YOU KNOW EDUCATION AND COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06939-B-0058)
BUT IT'S I JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF NEGATIVES  (fe_03_06939-B-0059)
AND UM  (fe_03_06939-B-0060)
SO YOU KNOW I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS MAY EVEN BECOME MORE ADVANCED IN THE FUTURE  (fe_03_06939-B-0061)
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AS AS PROG- AS SUPPOSED PROGRESS TAKES PLACE  (fe_03_06939-B-0062)
[NOISE] THAT COMPUT- BY COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06939-B-0063)
WELL I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING UM  (fe_03_06939-B-0065)
YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN EMPLOY THE PEOPLE OKAY  (fe_03_06939-B-0066)
THEN I'M ALL FOR THE COMPUTER USE  (fe_03_06939-B-0067)
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA YOU KNOW ERADICATE PEOPLE  (fe_03_06939-B-0068)
THEN IT'S YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06939-B-0069)
IT'S WORRISOME  (fe_03_06939-B-0070)
YEAH RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_06939-B-0071)
YEAH  (fe_03_06939-B-0072)
YEAH WELL IT YOU KNOW LISTEN NOW  (fe_03_06939-B-0073)
LET'S LOOK AT JAPAN FOR EXAMPLE OKAY  (fe_03_06939-B-0074)
THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COUNTRY ON THE PLANET  (fe_03_06939-B-0075)
COMPUTER USE YOU KNOW SO WIDELY  (fe_03_06939-B-0076)
USED  (fe_03_06939-B-0077)
AND UM THEY'VE HAD THEIR PROBLEMS ECONOMICALLY EVEN THOUGH  (fe_03_06939-B-0078)
THEY'VE SOLD YOU KNOW THE BEST CARS OR WHATEVER ELECTRONICS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06939-B-0079)
UM BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT UM  (fe_03_06939-B-0080)
YOU KNOW THEY STILL YOU KNOW THE THE RICHER PEOPLE STILL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN  (fe_03_06939-B-0082)
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING USING JAPAN AS AN EXAMPLE IS THAT IT WAS POSITIVE FOR THEM  (fe_03_06939-B-0083)
IN OTHER WORDS ALL THESE GAMES AH LIKE NINTENDO AND NINJA TURTLES AND ALL THAT THOSE WERE DONE BY HIGH JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS  (fe_03_06939-B-0084)
AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE INTELLIGENCE  (fe_03_06939-B-0085)
THAT CAN COME OUT OF COMPUTER USE WHEN EDUCATION  (fe_03_06939-B-0086)
JAPAN IS AN EXAMPLE  (fe_03_06939-B-0087)
AGAIN I I KNOW I SAID IT BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO WATCH AH THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION  (fe_03_06939-B-0089)
WITH COMPUTER USE  (fe_03_06939-B-0090)
AND YOU MADE NOTE OF THE FACT THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR KIDS WHO AREN'T EXACTLY YOU KNOW THAT ADEPT AT COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06939-B-0091)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06939-B-0093)
AND I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF CAN GET PRETTY COMPLEX  (fe_03_06939-B-0094)
DEFINITELY  (fe_03_06939-B-0095)
WELL LOOK AT YOUR AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IT BECAME VERY COMPLEX THROUGH EMISSIONS OKAY EMISSIONS  (fe_03_06939-B-0096)
BECAUSE OF COMPUTERS OKAY THOSE ARE ALL COMPUTERIZED  (fe_03_06939-B-0097)
NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATION WE TALK ABOUT MECHANICS  (fe_03_06939-B-0098)
THAT HAVE TO GO TO COLLEGE  (fe_03_06939-B-0099)
BECAUSE OF THAT SITUATION  (fe_03_06939-B-0100)
AND IT'S IT IS COMPLEX BELIEVE ME THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND IT COULD SEPARATE A GOOD MECHANIC  (fe_03_06939-B-0101)
IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE NEGATIVE WHERE A MECHANIC COULD BE VERY W- GOOD INCLINED ALTHOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06939-B-0102)
THEY LAG  (fe_03_06939-B-0103)
AND THEREFORE YOU HE COULD MISS AN OPPORTUNITY  (fe_03_06939-B-0104)
BECAUSE IT DOES IT IS A COMPLEX MATTER  (fe_03_06939-B-0105)
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EMISSIONS EVERY YEAR THESE THINGS CHANGE  (fe_03_06939-B-0106)
THE STATE REQUIRES A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS  (fe_03_06939-B-0107)
AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO CLASS AGAIN OKAY  (fe_03_06939-B-0108)
FOR YOUR COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE IF YOU'RE A MECHANIC  (fe_03_06939-B-0109)
IT'S NO SIMPLE TASK  (fe_03_06939-B-0111)
I WE BOTH A- BASICALLY SAID WE WERE FOR COMPUTER USE WITH EDUCATION AND WE NOTED THAT THERE ARE SOME CONS TO IT  (fe_03_06939-B-0113)
I SUPPOSE WE COULD SAY THE PROS OUTWEIGH THE CONS BOTH OF US  (fe_03_06939-B-0114)
BUT JUST TO WATCH YOU KNOW THOSE CONS YOU KNOW LIKE LACKADAISICAL BEHAVIOUR  (fe_03_06939-B-0115)
UM YOU KNOW LIKE AH  (fe_03_06939-B-0116)
