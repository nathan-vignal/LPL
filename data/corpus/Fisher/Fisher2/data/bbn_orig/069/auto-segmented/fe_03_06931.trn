YES I BELIEVE IT'S DO COMPUTERS IN SCHOOL OR JUST EDUCATION  (fe_03_06931-B-0003)
HARM OR IMPROVE  (fe_03_06931-B-0004)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06931-B-0006)
I THINK OVERALL IT IS HELPFUL  (fe_03_06931-B-0008)
IT COULD BE HARMFUL IN SOME WAYS TO THE POINT WHERE THE KID MAY NOT KNOW HOW TO HOW TO USE IT I MEAN REALLY BECAUSE TO ME YAHOO DOT COM THAT'S THAT TO ME IS IS A VERY GOOD RESEARCH 'CAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A BIG SEARCH ENGINE  (fe_03_06931-B-0009)
SO I MEAN IF THE KID KNOWS HOW TO USE IT THEN IT IT OBVIOUSLY IT WILL HELP IMPROVE SO I THINK IN IN SCHOOLS THEY NEED TO HAVE CLASSES  (fe_03_06931-B-0010)
POSSIBLY TO TEACH THE TEACH THE KIDS HOW TO USE IT OR WHAT ARE THE YOU KNOW THE HELPFUL  (fe_03_06931-B-0011)

EXACTLY  (fe_03_06931-B-0016)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06931-B-0017)
YEAH BUT THAT'S WHAT I THINK I JUST THINK THAT AH IF THE KIDS KEEP I MEAN IF IT IF THEY USE COMPUTERS OR WHATEVER I MEAN  (fe_03_06931-B-0018)
SEE BUT IT COULD BE DISTRACTING THOUGH BECAUSE A KID COULD YOU KNOW DOWNLOAD A MUSIC AND SIT THERE AND NOT CONCENTRATE OR TALK TO HIS FRIENDS ON THE INTERNET AND SO THAT I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY IT COULD BE YOU KNOW IT IT IT COULD BE YOU KNOW HARMFUL BUT  (fe_03_06931-B-0019)
IF THE SCHOOL  (fe_03_06931-B-0020)
