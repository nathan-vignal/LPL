I'M ROSETTA FROM NORTH CAROLINA  (fe_03_06978-A-0002)
FINE  (fe_03_06978-A-0003)
WELL WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT EDUCATION AND COMPUTERS MM I THINK THEY SERVE A PURPOSE BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING TOO DEPENDENT ON THEM  (fe_03_06978-A-0004)
BUT UM BUT AT THE SAME TIME CHILDREN THAT ARE IN SCHOOL AND THAT ARE SLOW TO CATCH ON A LOT OF THE COMPUTER GAMES ARE  (fe_03_06978-A-0005)
GOOD FOR THEM ESPECIALLY FOR THE HAND EYE COORD- COORDINATION  (fe_03_06978-A-0006)
I THINK  (fe_03_06978-A-0007)
WITH CALCULATORS  (fe_03_06978-A-0009)
THEY JUST DEPEND ON THAT THEY DON'T LEARN HOW TO COUNT  (fe_03_06978-A-0010)
MM MM NO I'M NOT IN EDUCATION I'M A CHILDCARE PROVIDER  (fe_03_06978-A-0011)
AND BY USING A CALCULATOR 'CAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY LITTLE TRICKS THAT WE WE WERE TAUGHT YOUNG ON HOW TO DO THE NUMBERS  (fe_03_06978-A-0012)
HOW SOME OF 'EM WAS USE YOUR HAND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T LEARN THOSE THINGS ANYMORE  (fe_03_06978-A-0013)
RIGHT BECAUSE I'D I W- WATCH THEM DO THEIR TIMES TABLES  (fe_03_06978-A-0014)
MY GRANDDAUGHTER GOES TO A SCHOOL AH  (fe_03_06978-A-0016)
THEY DON'T ALLOW CALCULATORS YOU GOT TO BE IN AT LEAST FIFTH GRADE BEFORE YOU CAN HAVE A CALCULATOR  (fe_03_06978-A-0017)
AT LEAST  (fe_03_06978-A-0018)
AND YOU GOT TO KNOW ALL YOUR TIMES TABLE AND THEY SING THAT THEY LEARN 'EM LIKE WE DID WE SANG THEM WE  (fe_03_06978-A-0019)
SPOKE THEM WE  (fe_03_06978-A-0020)
AND THIS IS THE WAY I THINK EDUCATION SHOULD BE  (fe_03_06978-A-0021)
AND THEN WHEN THEY KNOW 'EM THEY REALLY KNOW 'EM THEY'LL LAST WITH THEM YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER SAY TO ME SOMETIME  (fe_03_06978-A-0022)
OH GRANDMA HOW'D YOU GET THAT NUMBER SO QUICK I SAID BECAUSE I WAS TAUGHT HOW TO ADD AND SUBTRACT  (fe_03_06978-A-0023)
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DEPEND ON A CALCULATOR SHE'LL BE WAIT A MINUTE WAIT A MINUTE LET ME GET A CALCULATOR NO  (fe_03_06978-A-0024)
AND THEY'RE SO THEY'RE SO MANY LITTLE MATHS TRICKS TO YOU KNOW TO HELP YOU  (fe_03_06978-A-0028)
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME TO TO DEAL WITH THAT SOMETIMES  (fe_03_06978-A-0029)
AND THAT'S WHEN THEY START GETTING IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE BORED THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO  (fe_03_06978-A-0031)
HOLD THEIR INTEREST BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TAUGHT THAT  (fe_03_06978-A-0032)
YOU KNOW THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TAUGHT TO SIT DOWN AND AND TO TO REALLY READ AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06978-A-0033)
EVERYTHING IS OH OKAY I WELL IF THERE'S A BOOK I MEAN I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I WAS YOUNGER IF IT WAS A BOOK AND I WANTED TO READ AND I WANTED THE BOOK RIGHT I WOULD TRY TO FIND A  (fe_03_06978-A-0034)

HELEN OF TROY OKAY THERE'S A HELEN OF TROY MOVIE SEE RIGHT BUT OF COURSE IT WASN'T THE SAME AS IN THE BOOK BUT NOW THEY GO ON LINE AND GET SOME ANSWERS FOR EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06978-A-0036)
SO THEREFORE THEY MISS A LOT  (fe_03_06978-A-0037)
AND YOU KNOW I ALSO LOOK AT IT  (fe_03_06978-A-0038)
AS FAR AS EDUCATION IS CONCERNED THEY DON'T LEARN  (fe_03_06978-A-0039)
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES OR FOREIGN COUNTRIES THEY HAVE NO ID- THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHY WE'RE AT WAR  (fe_03_06978-A-0040)
THEY HAVE NO IDEA THEY DON'T KNOW THE BACKGROUND BEHIND IT BUT THIS IS STUFF THAT WE HAD TO WE HAD TO LEARN THIS STUFF  (fe_03_06978-A-0041)
SO LIKE I SAY I HAD THE KIDS WELL HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT STUFF I SAY WELL NUMBER ONE I'M OLDER AND I WAS TAUGHT THIS IN SCHOOL  (fe_03_06978-A-0042)
THEY DON'T HAVE REAL HISTORY ANYMORE THEY DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HISTORY AND I RESENT THAT  (fe_03_06978-A-0043)
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T KNOW HISTORY HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ADVANCE AND THEY WONDER WHY  (fe_03_06978-A-0044)
STUDENTS COME INTO THE UNITED STATES  (fe_03_06978-A-0045)
AND DO BETTER THAN THEY DO BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO LEARN THE HISTORY  (fe_03_06978-A-0046)
WHICH IS MM  (fe_03_06978-A-0048)
SEE EDUCATION IS JUST GETTING SLOPPY SO I FEEL LIKE PARENTS  (fe_03_06978-A-0049)
AND LIKE I SAID I'M A CHILDCARE PROVIDER CHILDCARE PROVIDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE TO TEACH 'EM IF THE SCHOOLS DON'T TEACH  (fe_03_06978-A-0050)
'EM WELL IT IT'S NECESSARY FOR MORE THAN W-  (fe_03_06978-A-0051)
SO THAT THEY CAN ADVANCE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO THE THINGS THEY DO THEY HAVE NO IDEA THEY JUST DO 'EM BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID DO BUT TO UNDERSTAND YOU  (fe_03_06978-A-0052)
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR A QUICK FIX  (fe_03_06978-A-0054)
THEY CLAIM THEY'RE LOOKING FOR MORE BUT IT'S NOT  (fe_03_06978-A-0055)
IT'S NOT IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY NOT  (fe_03_06978-A-0056)
YOU KNOW I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THEY TEACH 'EM THESE CONCEPTS AND ALL THESE FANCY NAMES HEY IT'S MATHEMATICS  (fe_03_06978-A-0057)
YOU KNOW YOU CAN GIVE IT A FANCY NAME  (fe_03_06978-A-0059)

WELL WELL I KNOW THAT I AM  (fe_03_06978-A-0061)
I I KNOW THAT I AM  (fe_03_06978-A-0062)
YOU KNOW BECAUSE  (fe_03_06978-A-0063)
I'LL PUT IT LIKE THIS I CAN REMEMBER I HAD THE SAME MATH TEACHER THAT MY MOTHER HAD [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06978-A-0064)
WHEN I WAS IN AH JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND MY MOTHER TOLD ME IT AIN'T GOING TO BE EASY IF YOU HAVEN'T LEARNT THE BASICS AND WHEN SHE HAD TAUGHT ME THE BASICS IT WAS EASY FOR ME  (fe_03_06978-A-0065)
IN FIRST GRADE  (fe_03_06978-A-0067)
OH MY GOODNESS  (fe_03_06978-A-0068)
OH MY GOODNESS  (fe_03_06978-A-0069)
SO THEY'LL OOH THAT THAT THAT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL  (fe_03_06978-A-0070)
THE EASY WAY OUT  (fe_03_06978-A-0071)
THAT'S NOT GOOD THAT IS NOT  (fe_03_06978-A-0072)
GOOD BUT ANYHOW LIKE I SAID UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY IT IS  (fe_03_06978-A-0073)
AND LIKE I SAY KIDS DON'T READ ANYMORE THEY UM SIT AND THEY WATCH TELEVISION AND AND THEN THEY THINK THAT THEY KNOW THE STORY AND YOU CAN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT OH I'VE SEEN THIS ON  (fe_03_06978-A-0074)
BLANKETY BLANK YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THE STORY YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT MAKING BOOK REPORTS  (fe_03_06978-A-0075)
YOU KNOW THEY  (fe_03_06978-A-0076)
AND RIGHT NOW SHE HAS TO DO A BOOK REPORT  (fe_03_06978-A-0078)
I MEAN SHE HAS TO GO TO THE LIBRARY SO THAT MEANS THAT DAY HER MOTHER HAS TO TAKE TIME AND TAKE HER TO THE LIBRARY SO IT'S NOT JUST THE CHILD THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06978-A-0079)
PARENTS HAVE TO DO A FEW THINGS TOO  (fe_03_06978-A-0080)
IT MAY BE INCONVENIENT BUT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06978-A-0081)
IT MAY BE INCONVENIENT BUT IF THIS IS YOUR CHILD'S FUTURE TO ME  (fe_03_06978-A-0082)
UM MY INCONVENIENCE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO REASSURE THAT SHE'S READY TO LIVE IN THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN TODAY  (fe_03_06978-A-0083)
SO IF I MISS THE TELEVISION SHOW OR I'M A LITTLE TIRED HEY  (fe_03_06978-A-0084)
MY MOMMA DID IT  (fe_03_06978-A-0085)
SHE BOUGHT ENCYCLOPEDIAS  (fe_03_06978-A-0086)
BUT WE DIDN'T DEPEND ON ENCYCLOPEDIAS SHE WOULD TAKE UM SHE WOULD TAKE US TO THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_06978-A-0087)
AND YOU KNOW DO WHAT HAD TO BE DONE  (fe_03_06978-A-0088)
AND THAT'S WHAT I FEEL PARENTS SHOULD DO NOW THEY UNDER USE THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_06978-A-0089)
THEY UNDER USE IT [NOISE]  (fe_03_06978-A-0090)

THE THING I THINK IS THAT THAT WE'RE  (fe_03_06978-B-0008)
MAKING THEM RELY TOO MUCH ON THEM AND ARE MISSING SOME OF THE BASICS SOMETIMES THAT THEY HAVE TO JUST LEARN  (fe_03_06978-B-0009)
BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOW THEY KNOW IF YOU PUT THE NUMBERS IN THE COMPUTER YOU GET THE ANSWER BUT THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S BEHIND IT  (fe_03_06978-B-0010)
BUT OTHERWISE I DO THINK A LOT OF THE THINGS OUT THERE ARE REALLY GOOD FOR THEM  (fe_03_06978-B-0011)

AND THEY DON'T REALISE IT  (fe_03_06978-B-0017)
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GET OUT OF IT OR HAVE AN IDEA  (fe_03_06978-B-0018)
I KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING THAT WITH THE CHILDREN MHM  (fe_03_06978-B-0019)

RIGHT  (fe_03_06978-B-0037)
NO  (fe_03_06978-B-0038)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06978-B-0040)
OR TO PUSH THAT THEY HAVE TO LEARN THESE THINGS  (fe_03_06978-B-0043)
THAT THEY'RE NECESSARY MHM  (fe_03_06978-B-0044)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06978-B-0045)
YES  (fe_03_06978-B-0047)
NO I DON'T MY MY CHILDREN ARE JUST STARTING OUT MY SON'S IN FIRST GRADE BUT YOU CAN SEE THE BIG DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06978-B-0049)
BUT THEN YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OLDER GRADES TOO FROM WHAT WE WERE REQUIRED THAN FROM WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED NOW  (fe_03_06978-B-0050)
IT'S A LOT LESS  (fe_03_06978-B-0051)
NO  (fe_03_06978-B-0052)
YEAH  (fe_03_06978-B-0053)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_06978-B-0062)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06978-B-0063)

NO I KNOW HE HE SEES THAT A LOT  (fe_03_06978-B-0065)
AND I KNOW WITH MY SON WE PUSH HIM THEY'VE THEY HAD MATHS HOMEWORK IN FIRST GRADE WHERE THEY WANTED THEM TO USE THE CALCULATOR AND I WROTE A NOTE TO THE TEACHER SAYING I'M SORRY BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT YES  (fe_03_06978-B-0066)
I I SAID AND AND SO THERE ANSWER WAS WELL WE'RE INTRODUCING TECHNOLOGY I SAID THEY'LL HAVE TO LEARN THE BASICS FIRST  (fe_03_06978-B-0067)
WELL IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONE AND ONLY TIME I FOUGHT THEM SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT THAT HAD AN EFFECT  (fe_03_06978-B-0068)
BECAUSE I SAID THAT'S NOT TECHNOLOGY THAT'S TEACHING HIM HOW TO PUSH BUTTONS  (fe_03_06978-B-0069)
BUT IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEHIND IT THEN IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THAT YOU TEACH HIM HOW TO PUSH THE BUTTONS  (fe_03_06978-B-0070)
YEAH  (fe_03_06978-B-0071)
YEAH  (fe_03_06978-B-0072)
