HI I'M DAVID  (fe_03_06984-A-0001)
WELL I THINK A- I THINK COMPUTERS CAN ENHANCE EDUCATION QUITE A LOT AH THERE'S JUST SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP PEOPLE BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO BE USED IN AH  (fe_03_06984-A-0002)
IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY BECAUSE  (fe_03_06984-A-0003)
I KNOW THAT WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL A LOT WE HAD COMPUTERS AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR EDUCATION PURPOSES BUT MOST OF THE TIMES WE JUST USED THEM FOR GAMES AND STUFF [NOISE]  (fe_03_06984-A-0004)
YEAH THAT'S TRUE I- IT'S JUST VERY EASY TO LOOK UP THINGS ON THE COMPUTER AND NOT EVEN HAVE TO VENTURE OUT TO THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_06984-A-0005)
AND SO I I KNOW THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH PLAGIARISM ESPECIALLY ON THE INTERNET  (fe_03_06984-A-0006)
SO I THINK IT JUST NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT RESPONSIBLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN KNOW HOW TO USE COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06984-A-0007)
BUT  (fe_03_06984-A-0008)
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THEY  (fe_03_06984-A-0009)
BUT THEY ALSO KNOW HOW TO GO TO THE LIBRARY LIKE YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE AND THAT THEY DON'T THAT THEY DON'T RELY A HUNDRED PERCENT ON A COMPUTER THAT THEY DON'T USE IT AS A CRUTCH  (fe_03_06984-A-0010)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06984-A-0011)
DO YOU THINK THAT YOUR EDUCATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ENHANCED BY USING COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06984-A-0012)
IT DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE INTERESTING BUT I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT VERY EVEN TODAY COMPUTERS AREN'T VERY WIDESPREAD I MEAN YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME COMPUTERS IN THE LIBRARY BUT IN THE CLASSROOM I I DOUBT THAT THERE'S THAT MANY COMPUTERS OUT THERE I COULD BE WRONG  (fe_03_06984-A-0013)
BUT  (fe_03_06984-A-0014)
THAT'S TRUE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE A LOT OF KIDS ESPECIALLY THEY  (fe_03_06984-A-0016)
INSTEAD OF READING THEY PLAY A LOT MORE VIDEO GAMES THAN  (fe_03_06984-A-0017)
THAN REALLY THEY SHOULD AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE MAJOR DRAWBACK TO USING TO HAVING COMPUTERS IN AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT BUT UM I JUST THINK AS LONG AS THERE'S SUPERVISION  (fe_03_06984-A-0018)
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW JUST POP THE KID IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER AND LET THE COMPUTER DO THE WORK BUT I THINK THAT STILL THE TEACHERS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO  (fe_03_06984-A-0019)
TO SUPERVISE AND TO TO INSTRUCT THEIR CHILDREN HOW TO USE THE COMPUTER IN A PROPER WAY AND AS WELL AS PARENTS TO GET TO CHANNEL CHILDREN'S  (fe_03_06984-A-0020)
INTERESTS TOWARDS THE MORE EDUCATIONAL THINGS AS OPPOSED TO  (fe_03_06984-A-0021)
THE MORE DANGEROUS THINGS ON COMPUTERS OR  (fe_03_06984-A-0022)
OR THE LESS EDUCATIONAL THINGS LIKE VIDEO GAMES  (fe_03_06984-A-0023)
[NOISE] ACTUALLY THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF UM I GUESS THEY NEED TO THEY NEED TO EDUCATE ESPECIALLY TEACHERS  (fe_03_06984-A-0024)
HOW TO HOW WHAT ARE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF OF LEARNING ON A COMPUTER BECAUSE  (fe_03_06984-A-0025)
A LOT OF TEACHERS THAT WHEN THEY WENT TO SCHOOL THERE PROBABLY WEREN'T THAT MANY COMPUTERS AROUND AND UM  (fe_03_06984-A-0026)
AND THAT AND NOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO TEACH USING COMPUTERS AND THE- THEY DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU THEN [NOISE]  (fe_03_06984-A-0027)
THAT'S VERY TRUE  (fe_03_06984-A-0028)
YEAH I I DON'T I DON'T THINK I KNOW ANYBODY WHO REALLY HAS UM I MEAN EXCEPT FOR SOME OLDER PEOPLE I KNOW BUT WHO DOESN'T WHO HAS A FULL SET OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS IT MUST BE E- IT USED TO BE MUCH MORE POPULAR BUT [MN]  (fe_03_06984-A-0029)
THE ONLY ENCYCLOPEDIAS THAT I REALLY KNOW ARE IN THE LIBRARY IT'S  (fe_03_06984-A-0030)
TRUE SO I GUESS THE COMPUTER [MN] THE COMPUTER ALSO ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE MUCH MORE UP TO DATE ON THINGS AND TO  (fe_03_06984-A-0031)
UM AND TO KEEP PEOPLE YOU KNOW ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND ON INFORMATION AS WELL  (fe_03_06984-A-0032)
THAT'S DEFINITELY A POSITIVE THING  (fe_03_06984-A-0033)
[NOISE] ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTERS [MN] BUT I GREW UP WITH LIKE I I MEAN IN SCHOOL WE HAD COMPUTERS BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK IT AFFECTED ME THAT MUCH BECAUSE THEY JUST WEREN'T  (fe_03_06984-A-0034)
LIKE THERE WERE COMPUTERS IN THE LIBRARY BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE COMPUTERS IN THE CLASSROOM AND WE HAD COMPUTER CLASS BUT IT WAS JUST A GLORIFIED LIKE TYPEWRITING CLASS  (fe_03_06984-A-0035)
SO I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY COMPUTERS AFFECTED ME IN ANY REAL POSITIVE WAY BE- AND LIKE WE'RE SAYING BEFORE [MN] I THINK IT'S BECAUSE ONE TEACHERS DIDN'T KNOW REALLY KNOW HOW TO TEACH WITH COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06984-A-0036)
AND ALSO IT'S JUST WITH HAVING COMPUTERS IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM FOR EVERYBODY'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE  (fe_03_06984-A-0037)
SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY EVEN TO HIRE TEACHERS SO HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO [NOISE]  (fe_03_06984-A-0038)
SPEND ALL THE MONEY TO BUY FOR THE ST- BUY STATE OF THE ART COMPUTERS AND AND SEND TEACHERS TO THESE TRAININGS  (fe_03_06984-A-0039)
YEAH SO AND  (fe_03_06984-A-0040)
IT'S IT'S HARD FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE CASH CASH STRAPPED SO I GUESS THEY JUST RELY ON TRADITIONAL METHODS WHICH ISN'T BAD BUT I THINK IT'S A SHAME THAT THEY DON'T UTILIZE ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THESE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE OUT THERE  (fe_03_06984-A-0041)
I KNOW THERE'S SPEC- THERE'S A LOT ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER KIDS LIKE PRESCHOOL AGE AND [MN] MAYBE KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE THAT REALLY DOESN'T GET TO MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE TO THEM  (fe_03_06984-A-0042)
YEAH IT'S IMPORTANT TO TEACH THEM WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER SO THEY  (fe_03_06984-A-0043)
YOU KNOW I THINK KIDS YOUNGER CAN ABSORB A LOT MORE  (fe_03_06984-A-0044)
BUT UM I THINK OLDER KIDS MAINLY USE IT FOR LIKE RESEARCH TOOLS AND IT IT IS INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE LIBRARY OR TO  (fe_03_06984-A-0045)
OR WHEN THEY'RE DOING A BOOK REPORT OR SOMETHING IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO GO ONLINE YOU KNOW IN YOUR OWN HOME OR AT AT SCHOOL THAN HAVING TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE LIBRARY  (fe_03_06984-A-0046)
AND A LOT OF KIDS NOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HOW TO KNOW HOW TO LOOK READ UM EXCUSE ME LOOK UP BOOKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE BASIC THINGS THAT PEOPLE  (fe_03_06984-A-0047)
YOU KNOW A LITTLE OLDER THAN OR MY PARENTS' GENERATION WOULD YOU KNOW KNOW HOW TO DO VERY WELL AND JUST [MN] PEOPLE MY AGE OR YOUNGER WOULD PROBABLY BE LOST LIKE USING A CARD CATALOGUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06984-A-0048)
MHM YEAH I- I MEAN  (fe_03_06984-A-0050)
I DON'T THINK KIDS HAVE AH SUCH A BIG INTEREST IN BOOKS BUT NOW EVEN EVEN LESS OF AN INTEREST THAN THEY USED TO HAVE  (fe_03_06984-A-0051)
ESPECIALLY NOW TO USE LIKE ESPECIALLY THEY IF THEY KIDS WANT TO EXERCISE THEIR IMAGINATION ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS YOU KNOW TURN ON A VIDEO GAME INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW GETTING ENGROSSED IN A BOOK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT [NOISE]  (fe_03_06984-A-0052)
MHM  (fe_03_06984-A-0054)
MHM A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK WORRY ABOUT THAT THERE'S THERE'S SO MANY DISTRACTIONS  (fe_03_06984-A-0055)
T._V. COMPUTERS AND AH YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF THERE'S LIKE NINTENDO AND PLAYSTATION AND GAMEBOY AND AND T._V. AND CABLE AND SATELLITE AND ALL THESE VIDEOS  (fe_03_06984-A-0056)
AND MAYBE THAT'S  (fe_03_06984-A-0058)
I THINK MAY MAYBE SOME PARENTS SEE THAT AS THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO REALLY SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN AS THEY'D LIKE TO SO THEY USE COMPUTERS AS A WAY TO EDUCATE THEM TO YOU KNOW TRY TO STEER THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION MAYBE THEY BUY THEM SOME EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06984-A-0059)
BUT IT JUST BECOMES LIKE ANOTHER T._V.  (fe_03_06984-A-0060)
AND IT DOESN'T REALLY GET THE EFFECT  (fe_03_06984-A-0061)
HI I'M VANESSA  (fe_03_06984-B-0001)
WELL WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL THEY WE DIDN'T HAVE 'EM AROUND SO  (fe_03_06984-B-0003)

YEAH DEFINITELY THEY THEY DEFINITELY NEED TO LEARN HOW  (fe_03_06984-B-0008)
YEAH I THINK KIDS CAN GET TOO WRAPPED UP IN IT BESIDES  (fe_03_06984-B-0010)
USING IT FOR SCHOOL I MEAN IT'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE MOST OF THE KIDS I KNOW USE THEM FOR  (fe_03_06984-B-0011)
VIDEO GAMES AND  (fe_03_06984-B-0012)
THEY'RE NOT REALLY VERY EDUCATIONAL WHEN YOU USE THEM THAT WAY  (fe_03_06984-B-0013)
IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE IT MORE INTERESTING  (fe_03_06984-B-0015)
YEAH I KNOW I DON'T I DON'T HAVE KIDS SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY  (fe_03_06984-B-0016)

USING THEM WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL BUT I THINK YEAH IT WOULD HAVE  (fe_03_06984-B-0019)
I COULD SEE HOW THEY WOULD HOLD A KID'S INTEREST MAYBE BUT  (fe_03_06984-B-0020)
I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR KIDS TO YOU  (fe_03_06984-B-0021)
KNOW DEVELOP A LOVE FOR READING AND  (fe_03_06984-B-0022)
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET THAT THROUGH A COMPUTER  (fe_03_06984-B-0023)
