AND IN THIS WORK I'VE BEEN READING UM HUNDREDS OF ESSAYS KIDS WRITING SOMETHING ABOUT A MOST ADMIRED TEACHER  (fe_03_06964-B-0031)
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S COME UP OCCASIONALLY IS THAT THEY  (fe_03_06964-B-0032)
THE TEACHER TELLS THEM HOW TO USE IT OR HELPS THEM WITH IT AND THAT THEY DO FIND IT USEFUL I'VE NEVER YET HAD ONE AH KID WHO SAY THEIR TEACHER PUSHED THEM TOO HARD ON THE COMPUTER OR THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT  (fe_03_06964-B-0033)
I I'M SURE THAT'S POSSIBLE OF COURSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE- SPEAK POSITIVELY ABOUT THE TEACHER SO AH  (fe_03_06964-B-0034)
THEN THE NEGATIVES MIGHT NOT COME OUT BUT ANYWAY THERE ARE OCCASIONAL REFERENCES TO HOW HELPFUL IT IS  (fe_03_06964-B-0035)

AT THAT THAT AGE THAT THAT'S THE ONES I'M READING NOW BUT I ALSO AH TAUGHT A CLASS A JUNIOR HIGH CLASS SEX EDUCATION COURSE  (fe_03_06964-B-0037)

AND AS A STUDENT WELL I'M NOT A STUDENT SO MUCH A STUDENT MYSELF BUT AS A STUDENT OF THE STOCK MARKET IT'S HELPFUL AND YOU CAN RESEARCH A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WAY  (fe_03_06964-B-0048)

AND THEN THEY CAN GET TO A TWO AND IF THEY DO A LITTLE MORE THEN THEY GET SOME A THREE AND SO FORTH AND THEY HAVE TO KINDA FILL UP ABOUT A PAGE TO GET AH TO A THREE OR A FOUR SCORE AND HAVE TO DO MORE THAN THAT AND USE A YOU KNOW SOME GOOD VOCABULARY TO  (fe_03_06964-B-0061)
