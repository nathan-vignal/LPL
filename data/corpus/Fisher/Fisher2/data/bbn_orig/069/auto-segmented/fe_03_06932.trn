THE CHILDREN THAN A COMPUTER CAN NOW THAT I I'M I KNOW THEY CAN LEARN THINGS ON THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_06932-A-0012)
IT'S JUST THAT THEY NEED THAT HUMAN TOUCH TO REALLY LEARN IT AND TO BE THERE FOR THEM  (fe_03_06932-A-0013)
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'LL BE QUESTIONS AND STUFF THAT TEACHERS CAN ANSWER AND COMPUTERS CAN'T  (fe_03_06932-A-0014)

BUT YOU STILL NEED THE TEACHERS TO BE THERE TOO  (fe_03_06932-A-0043)

UM BUT I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH THAT  (fe_03_06932-A-0076)
I DON'T THINK  (fe_03_06932-A-0077)
TEACHERS SHOULD BE REPLACED I THINK THE TE- COMPUTERS SHOULD BE THERE JUST TO HELP  (fe_03_06932-A-0078)

THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU CANNOT LEARN FROM THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_06932-B-0011)
RIGHT WELL I THINK THE COMPUTER IS REALLY GREAT TO DRILL AND REINFORCE AND UM  (fe_03_06932-B-0012)
THINGS LIKE THAT  (fe_03_06932-B-0013)

I MEAN THE LOTTERY HAS FUNDED A LOT OF COMPUTERS AND WE REALLY DO HAVE THE COMPUTERS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO MAINTAIN  (fe_03_06932-B-0017)
