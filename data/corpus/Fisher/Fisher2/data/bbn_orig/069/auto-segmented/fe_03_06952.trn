YEAH AND I I REALLY FEEL THAT BY THE TIME YOU LEARN A LITTLE MORE IT IT'S AMAZING YOU'LL FIND HOW COULD I HAVE DONE WITHOUT THIS  (fe_03_06952-A-0059)
IT'S JUST LIKE THE MICROWAVES WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT I DIDN'T THINK WHAT DO I NEED A MICROWAVE FOR I'M A GOOD COOK  (fe_03_06952-A-0060)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06952-A-0061)

WILL PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO TEACH MOM SOMETHING  (fe_03_06952-A-0088)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06952-A-0089)
AND THE THING IS YOU APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CONDEMN YOU IF YOU DO ONE OR TWO THINGS WRONG [NOISE]  (fe_03_06952-A-0090)

[NOISE] OH YES  (fe_03_06952-B-0020)
[NOISE] AT ONE POINT I HAD NOTICED THAT SO MANY JOBS WERE REQUIRING COMPUTER LITERACY EVEN THINGS THAT YEARS AGO THAT JUST WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE  (fe_03_06952-B-0021)
YES  (fe_03_06952-B-0022)
IT'S TRUE I MEAN THEY HAVE COMPUTERS AT REGISTERS NOW EVEN WITH PLACES WITH MCDONALDS  (fe_03_06952-B-0023)
THAT'S TRUE WELL ONE THING I'VE NOTICED BUT SPECIALLY WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE FROM SAY THE AGE OF TWENTIES ON DOWN THEY DON'T HAVE THE FEAR OF COMPUTERS THAT MANY OLDER PEOPLE HAVE  (fe_03_06952-B-0024)
THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR SO LONG THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE  (fe_03_06952-B-0025)
I DID TOO I WAS SO AFRAID OF IT WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT GETTING THEM IN OUR ROOM I THOUGHT OH NO YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO THIS I'LL LET THE STUDENTS DO IT  (fe_03_06952-B-0026)
[LAUGHTER] THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06952-B-0027)
[MN] I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON STARTED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HE'S TWENTY SEVEN AND IT WAS SUCH A BIG THING TO HIM TO OH MUMMY WE DO THIS ON THE COMPUTERS AND HE WOULD ALWAYS COME HOME AND BRAG ABOUT IT  (fe_03_06952-B-0028)

MHM  (fe_03_06952-B-0036)
WELL THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06952-B-0037)
WELL ONE THING WE HAD TO MAKE VERY CLEAR TO THE CHILDREN IS THAT WE WOULD NOT ACCEPT PRINTOUTS OF WHAT THEY FOUND ON THE COMPUTER FOR AN ASSIGNMENT THEY REALLY HAD TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE WHAT THEY LEARNED  (fe_03_06952-B-0038)
BECAUSE WE WERE GETTING ALL KINDS OF PRINTOUTS THESE CHILDREN WOULD JUST SEE SOMETHING PRINT IT UP AND BRING IT IN  (fe_03_06952-B-0039)
YOU KNOW WE HAD TO EXPLAIN THAT I YOU KNOW IF I WANTED TO SEE THAT I COULD TURN ON THE COMPUTER MYSELF OKAY I WANT TO KNOW WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF IT  (fe_03_06952-B-0040)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06952-B-0041)
NOW I REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO DO BOOK REPORTS BY COPYING FROM THE DUST JACKET YOU KNOW AND FOR YEARS WE GOT AWAY WITH IT UNTIL WE HAD A TEACHER WHO WAS WISE ENOUGH TO FIGURE OH NO I'VE SEEN THESE WORDS BEFORE  (fe_03_06952-B-0042)
THAT'S TRUE AND WE WOULD GIVE OURSELVES AWAY CONSTANTLY  (fe_03_06952-B-0043)
MOST OF US DIDN'T THINK ABOUT REWRITING THEM USING OUR OWN WORDS WE'D JUST COPY SO WHEN I SEE THE STUDENTS PULLING THAT NUMBER WITH THE COMPUTER IT'S LIKE OH NO NO NO I COULD HAVE DONE THIS MYSELF DON'T EVEN GO THERE  (fe_03_06952-B-0044)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06952-B-0045)
