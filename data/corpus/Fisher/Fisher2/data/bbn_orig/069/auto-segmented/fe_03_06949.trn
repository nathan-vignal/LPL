I'M RITA  (fe_03_06949-A-0001)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06949-A-0002)
WELL [LAUGHTER] THERE WAS A LOT OF NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WAS I BELIEVE THE QUESTION WAS WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT COMPUTERS AND WHETHER IT IMPROVES EDUCATION THROUGH CHILDREN IS THAT CORRECT  (fe_03_06949-A-0003)
[LAUGHTER] UH I THINK IT UM BASICALLY IS AN IMPROVEMENT HOW DO YOU FEEL  (fe_03_06949-A-0004)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0005)
THAT'S TRUE I BELIEVE THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE  (fe_03_06949-A-0006)
DO THEY  (fe_03_06949-A-0007)
THAT'S TRUE AND UM  (fe_03_06949-A-0008)
THEY MAY GIVE A LITTLE MORE ASSISTANCE THAN WHAT IS REALLY NECESSARY  (fe_03_06949-A-0009)
UH AND NOT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO  (fe_03_06949-A-0010)
UH I DON'T WANT TO SAY USE THEIR IMAGINATION BUT TO CHALLENGE THEM [NOISE]  (fe_03_06949-A-0011)
NO I DON'T THINK SO EITHER  (fe_03_06949-A-0012)
THAT WAS MY NEXT  (fe_03_06949-A-0013)
THAT WAS MY COMMENT  (fe_03_06949-A-0014)
THEY ARE TAKING FOR GRANTED IT ALSO GIVES CHILDREN UH MORE OF A CHANCE TO USE COMPUTER IN NON CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS LIKE GAMES AND VIDEOS AND THAT TYPE OF THING  (fe_03_06949-A-0015)
AND  (fe_03_06949-A-0016)
[LAUGHTER] AND SOME OF THEM GET SO ABSORBED IN THEM THAT THEY FORGET THERE'S AN OUTSIDE WORLD [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06949-A-0017)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0018)
AND WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL PARENTS DO THAT CORRECT  (fe_03_06949-A-0019)
THAT'S TRUE BUT IN THE SAME RESPECT THOSE SAME PARENTS PROBABLY DON'T MONITOR UH THE T._V. VIEWING ASPECT [MN]  (fe_03_06949-A-0020)
WELL I'M NOT SURE IN THIS AGE WHETHER IT'S LIKE USING D._O._S. AND WINDOWS SEE I REMEMBER THE D._O._S. WORLD  (fe_03_06949-A-0021)
AND UH THE COMMENT FROM OUR M._I._S. PEOPLE WAS NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS WELL DO WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW  (fe_03_06949-A-0022)
AND I'M NOT SURE  (fe_03_06949-A-0023)
MHM  (fe_03_06949-A-0024)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0025)
YEAH  (fe_03_06949-A-0026)
YEAH THAT'S A REAL DRAWBACK  (fe_03_06949-A-0027)
WELL YOU KNOW YOU DO HAVE A POINT UH MY CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING COMPUTERS AS MUCH AS CHILDREN DO NOW THERE WERE SOME COMPUTERS BUT THEY WERE VERY LIMITED AND THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF  (fe_03_06949-A-0028)
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DEPENDED ON THEM AS MUCH  (fe_03_06949-A-0029)
AS WHAT THEY ARE NOW  (fe_03_06949-A-0030)
WELL IT WASN'T A TOY NOR WAS IT AS VIS- UH THE VISUALS WEREN'T SOMETHING THAT WERE DRAWING YOU THERE WERE THEY  (fe_03_06949-A-0031)
GRAPHICS AND SOUND [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06949-A-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0033)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0034)
YEAH  (fe_03_06949-A-0035)
SO I GUESS THE CONCLUSION IS IT'S NOT REALLY GOOD ALL THE TIME IS IT IT SHOULD BE MAYBE KEPT TO A LIMITED  (fe_03_06949-A-0036)
MHM  (fe_03_06949-A-0037)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0038)
THERE'LL BE PROBLEMS FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD  (fe_03_06949-A-0039)
MHM  (fe_03_06949-A-0040)
RIGHT AND I GUESS YOU MORE OR LESS ANSWER YOU KNOW YOU DO NEED SPELLING  (fe_03_06949-A-0041)
AND YOU DO DO NEED TO KNOW THE BASICS OF MATH WITHOUT  (fe_03_06949-A-0042)
SO YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] WELL THAT RELATES BACK TO D._O._S. AND OTHER THINGS BUT [SIGH] THEY ARE GETTING A BIT CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM  (fe_03_06949-A-0043)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0044)
MHM  (fe_03_06949-A-0045)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0046)
REALLY AND IT REALLY DOESN'T IT WOULD PREVENT CHILDREN I THINK FROM MAKING USE OF THE WONDERFUL LIBRARIES THAT WE HAVE  (fe_03_06949-A-0047)
AND NOTHING'S NICER THAN GOING INTO A LIBRARY AND GETTING LOST IN A WORLD OF BOOKS  (fe_03_06949-A-0048)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0049)
AND SOME OF THEM AREN'T CONSTRUCTIVE  (fe_03_06949-A-0050)
YEAH  (fe_03_06949-A-0051)

YOU DO HAVE SOME POINTS YEAH  (fe_03_06949-A-0055)
I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU AND  (fe_03_06949-A-0056)
UM  (fe_03_06949-A-0057)
LIKE YOU SAY MAYBE IF THEY WOULD JUST USE IT ON A LIMITED BASIS BECAUSE  (fe_03_06949-A-0058)
IN THEIR ADULT YEARS THEY DO HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO USE IT EXCLUSIVELY FOR ALL OF THEIR HOMEWORK WHEN THEY'RE YOUNGER  (fe_03_06949-A-0059)
RIGHT AND THEY'RE DEVELOPING BAD HABITS AS FAR AS USING A KEYBOARD BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY FIVE YEAR OLDS OR EVEN SIX SEVEN EIGHT THAT KNOW HOW TO UH TYPE UNLESS THEY TEACHING TEACHING IT AT A YOUNGER AGE BUT  (fe_03_06949-A-0060)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_06949-A-0061)
NOW THAT IS SCARY  (fe_03_06949-A-0063)
THAT IS SCARY  (fe_03_06949-A-0064)
[LAUGHTER] IS THIS EASIER FOR OUR TEACHERS  (fe_03_06949-A-0065)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06949-A-0066)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-A-0067)
YOUR SIX YEAR OLD IS IN KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE  (fe_03_06949-A-0068)
AND THEY HAVE COMPUTERS  (fe_03_06949-A-0069)
REALLY  (fe_03_06949-A-0070)
THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION  (fe_03_06949-A-0071)

HI RITA I'M CALLING FROM VERMONT  (fe_03_06949-B-0002)
UH WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE TOPIC  (fe_03_06949-B-0003)
THAT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD YES  (fe_03_06949-B-0004)
WELL I I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THEY GET THE COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE UM SINCE THEY NEED TO USE IT SO MUCH MORE NOW THAN WHEN I WAS A KID  (fe_03_06949-B-0005)
BUT I WONDER IF MAYBE BY INTRODUCING IT AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE THERE MAY BE MISSING TIME THAT COULD BE SPENT ON SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_06949-B-0006)
I MEAN MY SON IS IN KINDERGARTEN AND THEY HAVE COMPUTERS EVERY WEEK  (fe_03_06949-B-0007)
ON YEAH IT SEEMS SORT OF SILLY TO ME THAT A YOU KNOW KINDERGARTENER WHO CAN'T NECESSARILY EVEN IDENTIFY EVERY SINGLE LETTER YOU KNOW IS IS USING THE THE COMPUTER TO SAY MAKE PICTURES OR WHATEVER UM  (fe_03_06949-B-0008)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-B-0009)
WELL I KNOW A LOT OF TIMES UM  (fe_03_06949-B-0010)
LIKE AS THE KIDS GET OLDER UH MY DAUGHTER MY DAUGHTER IS TEN AND SOME OF THE HOMEWORK PROBLEMS THAT SHE'S  (fe_03_06949-B-0011)
GOT TO DO HAVE THEM USING COMPUTERS YOU KNOW AND IT WILL SAY YOU KNOW USE THE INTERNET TO LOOK UP  (fe_03_06949-B-0012)
UH AND I DON'T KNOW IF I NECESSARILY THINK THAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE THE INTERNET AT TEN YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06949-B-0013)
YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WHAT IF THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS AT HOME  (fe_03_06949-B-0014)
YOU KNOW THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW FIND ONE IN THE LIBRARY OR OR STAY AFTER SCHOOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM TO FINISH THEIR HOMEWORK [NOISE]  (fe_03_06949-B-0015)
THAT'S VERY TRUE  (fe_03_06949-B-0016)
RIGHT WELL WE GET AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SCHOOL YEAR WE GET A UH NOTE THAT COMES FROM THE COMPUTER LAB THAT WARNS THAT YOU KNOW THE INTERNET IS A DANGEROUS PLACE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU YOU KNOW SIT THERE AND MONITOR WITH YOUR CHILD SO THAT  (fe_03_06949-B-0017)
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T COME ACROSS ANY SITES THAT THEY PERHAPS SHOULDN'T BE COMING ACROSS AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF  (fe_03_06949-B-0018)
THEM GOING ON  (fe_03_06949-B-0019)
RIGHT RIGHT AND HOW MANY OF THEM ARE OUT THERE DOING LOOKING AT SITES THAT MAYBE DON'T REALLY HELP THEM WITH [NOISE] WHAT IT IS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ACCOMPLISHING [NOISE]  (fe_03_06949-B-0020)
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06949-B-0021)
AND I MEAN I'M WONDERING TOO IS CAN THE NORMAL TEN YEAR OLD NOW GO INTO THE LIBRARY AND ACTUALLY USE THE CARD CATALOGUE TO LOOK SOMETHING UP  (fe_03_06949-B-0022)
I MEAN THEY'RE SO USED TO GOING INTO THE COMPUTER ROOM AND SITTING DOWN AND TYPING YOU KNOW RABBITS OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEIR PROJECT IS ON BUT COULD THEY ACTUALLY GO TO THE CARD CATALOGUE AND AND  (fe_03_06949-B-0023)
OH YEAH I DO TOO  (fe_03_06949-B-0024)
TRUE  (fe_03_06949-B-0025)
[NOISE] I STILL THINK THEY NEED TO KNOW THE BASICS I MEAN IT IT'S GREAT TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER AND YOU KNOW TYPE IN A WORD AND HAVE THE COMPUTER DO THE WORK FOR YOU  (fe_03_06949-B-0026)
BUT IT'S LIKE CALCULATORS IF ALL YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS PUNCH THE BUTTONS THEN DO WE STOP TEACHING THE KIDS MATH BECAUSE THE COMPUTER WILL DO IT FOR THEM  (fe_03_06949-B-0027)
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SPELL CHECK ON THE YOU KNOW TERM PAPERS OR WHATEVER WELL THE KIDS CAN'T SPELL ANY BETTER THAN THEY DID BEFORE YOU KNOW BUT THE SPELL CHECK WILL FIND ALL THE SPELLING ERRORS FOR THEM  (fe_03_06949-B-0028)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06949-B-0029)
WELL I KNOW MY PARENTS HAD A COMPUTER WHEN I WAS GROWING UP BUT IT WASN'T EVER ANYTHING THAT I SAT DOWN IN FRONT OF TO PLAY WITH OR DO MY HOMEWORK ON OR YOU KNOW IT IT JUST WASN'T IT WASN'T A TOY I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING  (fe_03_06949-B-0030)
TRUE TRUE I MEAN NOWADAYS ANY PROGRAM YOU OPEN UP YOU KNOW IT HAS YOU KNOW CARTOON CHARACTERS AND IT HAS MUSIC AND IT HAS YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF FUN EXCITING THINGS ON THERE WHEREAS WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN I  (fe_03_06949-B-0031)
FIRST WENT INT COMPUTERS IT HAD WORDS [LAUGHTER] AND THAT WAS IT MAYBE SOME OF THEM WERE ORANGE AND SOME OF THEM WERE WHITE BUT THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH JUST WORDS  (fe_03_06949-B-0032)
WELL I THINK IF THEY HAVE THE  (fe_03_06949-B-0033)
BASICS I MEAN IF IF THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE ALREADY AND THEY USE THE COMPUTER TO SORT OF  (fe_03_06949-B-0034)
EXPAND ON THE BASICS THEN THAT'S PROBABLY OKAY BUT IF SOMEBODY'S SITTING DOWN WITH THE COMPUTER AND DOESN'T HAVE THE BASICS ALREADY  (fe_03_06949-B-0035)
UM YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S HURTING THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING  (fe_03_06949-B-0036)
SURE I MEAN IF IF YOU TAKE A A NINE YEAR OLD WHO CAN'T SPELL BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY RUN ALL THEIR HOMEWORK THROUGH THE SPELL CHECK THEN YOU KNOW AT TWENTY FIVE WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SPELL ANY BETTER  (fe_03_06949-B-0037)
WELL I THINK BE I MEAN I CAN UNDERSTAND THEM WANTING TO KNOW HOW TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE  (fe_03_06949-B-0038)
AND IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR SAY A TINY SCHOOL TO MAKE THE INFORMATION ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB AVAILABLE TO A CHILD DOING A TERM PAPER  (fe_03_06949-B-0039)
THAN IT IS TO TRY TO HAVE A MILLION BOOKS IN A TINY SCHOOL LIBRARY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO LOOK UP FOR THAT SAME TERM PAPER  (fe_03_06949-B-0040)
BUT I THINK THAT IF YOU IF YOU SKIP OVER THE KNOWLEDGE AND FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE TECHNOLOGY PORTION OF IT  (fe_03_06949-B-0041)
I MEAN MY DAUGHTER CAN SIT DOWN WITH THE COMPUTER AND DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE WORLD TO FIGURE OUT A MATH PROBLEM BUT YOU GIVE HER A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL AND SHE COULDN'T DO IT ANYWHERE NEARLY AS GOOD  (fe_03_06949-B-0042)
TRUE  (fe_03_06949-B-0043)
VERY TRUE AND I WONDER IF I MEAN I'M VERY LUCKY BOTH MY KIDS LOVE TO READ BUT I WONDER HOW MANY KIDS THAT DON'T ENJOY READING DON'T ENJOY IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SPENDING TIME IN FRONT OF YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF READING  (fe_03_06949-B-0044)
RIGHT I MEAN I I GUESS IF THEY  (fe_03_06949-B-0045)
IF THEY'RE CLOSELY MONITORED IN SCHOOL SO THAT THEY'RE  (fe_03_06949-B-0046)
YOU KNOW GETTING THE BASICS AND GETTING THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS FIRST  (fe_03_06949-B-0047)
THEN SLOWLY I GUESS USING COMPUTERS TO TEACH THEM HOW TO ACTUALLY TYPE AND WHAT THIS KEY DOES AND WHAT THAT KEY DOES  (fe_03_06949-B-0048)
THEN THAT'S PROBABLY OKAY BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU KNOW HAVING MY FIVE YEAR OLD SIT IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER TO PAINT A PICTURE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN  (fe_03_06949-B-0049)
IS AS USEFUL AS SENDING HIM TO ART CLASS AND ACTUALLY LETTING HIM DIP HIS FINGERS IN THE THE PAINTS AND AND DO IT HIMSELF  (fe_03_06949-B-0050)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06949-B-0051)
THAT'S TRUE ESPECIALLY THE THE KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE THE COMPUTERS AT HOME  (fe_03_06949-B-0052)
THAT'S TRUE THEY'RE  (fe_03_06949-B-0053)
WELL BOTH OF MINE JUST SORT OF POKE AT THEM SO I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY STRESSING THE TYPING SKILLS MAYBE WHEN THEY GET OLDER THEY TEACH THEM MORE OF THE  (fe_03_06949-B-0054)
YOU KNOW THE APPROPRIATE FINGER PLACEMENTS AND STUFF BUT I THINK THEY'RE JUST  (fe_03_06949-B-0055)
TEACH I MEAN MY SON LEARNED HOW TO SPELL HIS NAME ON THE COMPUTER AT SCHOOL [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY WERE TEACHING HIM YOU KNOW PUNCH OUT PUNCH OUT THE LETTERS AND YOU KNOW HE COULD DO THAT BEFORE HE COULD ACTUALLY PRINT IT WITH THE PENCIL  (fe_03_06949-B-0056)
I MEAN THAT THAT'S FRIGHTENING I MEAN LET'S TEACH HIM LET'S TEACH HIM HOW TO DO THE BASIC STUFF FIRST LET'S TEACH HIM PENMANSHIP SO YOU CAN READ HIS WRITING BEFORE YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT YOU KNOW SHOWING HIM WHERE THE LETTERS ARE ON THE KEYBOARD  (fe_03_06949-B-0057)
WELL IT'S PROBABLY  (fe_03_06949-B-0058)
IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO READ THEIR WRITING [LAUGHTER] WHEN THEY TYPE IT ON THE COMPUTER YOU KNOW TRYING TO INTERPRET SAY A SEVEN OR EIGHT YEAR OLD'S PENMANSHIP YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY TEACH PENMANSHIP ANY LONGER IT'S PROBABLY EASIER TO HAVE THEM TYPE IT ON THE COMPUTER  (fe_03_06949-B-0059)
HE'S IN KINDERGARTEN HE'LL GRADUATE KINDERGARTEN IN TWO WEEKS  (fe_03_06949-B-0060)
OH YEAH ONCE A WEEK THEY GO TO COMPUTER CLASS YEAH  (fe_03_06949-B-0061)
YEAH YEAH AND I MEAN WE LIVE IN A A SMALL TOWN SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE IN SOME  (fe_03_06949-B-0062)
NO IT'S GOT ABOUT FORTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE IN IT SO IT'S  (fe_03_06949-B-0063)
DEFINITELY NOT A BIG [LAUGHTER] HUGE CITY OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_06949-B-0064)
