AND IF THE ACTUAL GUYS WHO WERE WHO WERE OVER THERE DOING THE FIGHTING WERE IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNING OF IT THINGS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW MAYBE WE COULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY SAY COMMUNICATE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO RAISE ARMS TO DO IT  (fe_03_06913-A-0018)
AND SEE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST  (fe_03_06913-A-0019)
ABOUT  (fe_03_06913-A-0020)
YEAH BUT I THINK THAT IF THEY COULD SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND PLAN THINGS OUT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY MORE WARS THEY COULD COME TO SOME TYPE OF A MUTUAL AGREEMENT THAT WOULD BENEFIT EVERYBODY  (fe_03_06913-A-0021)
BECAUSE A  (fe_03_06913-A-0022)

TO TAKE RESOURCES FROM HERE TO REBUILD ANOTHER PLACE I WISH THAT THERE WAS A WAY THAT EVERYONE COULD DO AS THEY DID IN THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW CREATE THEIR OWN RESOURCES AND BE MORE SELF AH SUPPORTIVE  (fe_03_06913-A-0030)
YOU KNOW THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO RELY ON SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT  (fe_03_06913-A-0031)

YOU KNOW HOW YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY IS GETTING BAD AND YOU KNOW SO I REALLY FEEL THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06913-A-0036)
I I DON'T FEAR SO MUCH THREATS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AS I DO OF OUR OWN COLLAPSE BASICALLY YOU KNOW ECONOMICALLY AND AND AH YOU KNOW FOODWISE EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06913-A-0037)
BECAUSE SO MUCH IS GOING TO SO MANY OTHER PLACES YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06913-A-0038)

THERE'S SO MUCH THEY COULD DO HERE IN BUILDING AND CARRYING ON AND THEN TEACH PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO THE SAME THING  (fe_03_06913-A-0050)
YOU KNOW IN THAT IT IT'S STRANGE THE WAY I THINK ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IT'S JUST  (fe_03_06913-A-0051)
TO ME LIKE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY TELLS ME BECAUSE I'M IN ANIMAL RESCUE THAT AH I SHOULD THINK MORE ABOUT HOMELESS PEOPLE AND STARVING CHILDREN  (fe_03_06913-A-0052)

YEAH BUT UM I GUESS LIKE I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I I THINK MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE REPORTS I READ ARE ALL ABOUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN BEING YOU KNOW RAPED AND  (fe_03_06913-B-0007)
THINGS RIGHT NOW I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THAT EVEN AFTER THE REBUILDING THAT THEY WOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO REALLY COME AFTER US AND I THINK THE TERRORIST CELLS THAT ARE ALREADY  (fe_03_06913-B-0008)
IN EXISTENCE ARE STRONG ENOUGH AND THOSE AREN'T THE PEOPLE WE'RE HELPING TO REBUILD BUT I HAVE A KIND OF TAINTED VIEW ON THAT SUBJECT  (fe_03_06913-B-0009)
UM  (fe_03_06913-B-0010)
YEAH  (fe_03_06913-B-0011)
MHM DEFINITELY  (fe_03_06913-B-0012)

YOU KNOW THEY HAVE JUST SUCH AN AN ENDLESS ARMY AND SUCH A HUGE CAPACITY FOR  (fe_03_06913-B-0015)
FOR DESTRUCTION AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND IT KIND OF UM I THINK IT KIND OF WORRIES ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE THREATS TO STOP THEM BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE SAME ARMY CAPACITY THE SAME WEAPONS I MEAN THE IT WOULD JUST BE  (fe_03_06913-B-0016)
I THINK THERE'D BE MORE FOR US TO LOSE FROM NORTH KOREA THAN IF IF BY THEM ATTACKING US THAN IF WE ATTACKED THEM  (fe_03_06913-B-0017)
SO THAT'S A LITTLE SCARY TO ME  (fe_03_06913-B-0018)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_06913-B-0020)

UH-HUH  (fe_03_06913-B-0024)
YEAH  (fe_03_06913-B-0025)
YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT THE THING IS THOUGH AS WELL THAT EVEN WHEN WE DO HAVE TO RAISE ARMS TO DO IT I THINK THAT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY WARS IN THE U._S. IN  (fe_03_06913-B-0026)
YOU KNOW SINCE WHAT LIKE THE CIVIL WAR I THINK THAT IT'S PEOPLE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT A WAR IS REALLY ABOUT AND SO IT'S LIKE AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY SAYS THEY'RE FOR IT THEY NEVER TRULY COMMIT TO WHAT THE REALITY OF A WAR IS  (fe_03_06913-B-0027)
I MEAN PEOPLE KNOW YOU KNOW VIETNAM AND WORLD WAR TWO AND ONE AND EVERYTHING BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A L- I THINK FOR AT LEAST ME AND A LOT OF THE  (fe_03_06913-B-0028)
THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW IT'S YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT WAR IS BUT YOU REALLY DON'T COMPREHEND LIKE THE TRUE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION THAT THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT HERE  (fe_03_06913-B-0029)
SO  (fe_03_06913-B-0030)
YEAH THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN WARS AS LEADERS  (fe_03_06913-B-0031)
YOU KNOW THEY KNOW THE REALITY OF IT  (fe_03_06913-B-0032)
MHM  (fe_03_06913-B-0033)
YEAH  (fe_03_06913-B-0034)
HUH I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GET RID OF WAR I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GET TO THAT POINT  (fe_03_06913-B-0035)
YEAH YEAH I DO THINK THAT OUR BIGGEST THREAT IS COME COMES FROM THE DEVELOPING WORLD SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE YOU'RE WILLING TO RISK EVERYTHING  (fe_03_06913-B-0037)
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW EUROPE IS GOING TO ATTACK US THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH TO LOSE ECONOMICALLY YOU KNOW  (fe_03_06913-B-0038)
YEAH BUT THE WAY EVERYTHING'S GOING I THAT I THINK THAT ONCE YOU KNOW GLOBALISATION HAS SET IN AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY TURNING BACK YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO BE THE NEW REALITY OF IT ALL BUT I WHAT SCARES ME IS THAT WE'VE LEFT OUT  (fe_03_06913-B-0041)
A HUGE PART OF THE POPULATION OF THE WORLD AND UNTIL THEY'RE TIED INTO IT AND FEEL THE NEED TO PRESERVE IT THEN I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN OUTSIDE THREAT  (fe_03_06913-B-0042)
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING  (fe_03_06913-B-0043)
IF YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED YOU CAN CUT YOURSELF OFF FROM YOU KNOW TWENTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND IT'S NOT GOING TO AFFECT YOU  (fe_03_06913-B-0044)
UNLESS YOUR AGRICULTURE GOES DOWN AND THEN YOU NEED FOOD [LAUGHTER] SO  (fe_03_06913-B-0045)

OH THAT'S INTERESTING H-  (fe_03_06913-B-0051)
YEAH  (fe_03_06913-B-0052)
IT'S LIKE THE U._S. GO- WE HAVE LIKE A VERY SMALL FOOD AID THAT WE GIVE TO THE RES- JUST BECAUSE I WORK WITH IT THIS IS WHY I KNOW THIS BUT WE DON'T GIVE THAT MUCH FOOD AID AWAY AT ALL IT'S ALL ALL OF OUR SURPLUS AND THE FARMERS ARE ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE PUSHING FOR IT BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH HUGE  (fe_03_06913-B-0054)
SUPPLIES THAT WE COULD FEED OUR NATION I THINK THE STATISTIC WAS LIKE TWICE  (fe_03_06913-B-0055)
FROM WHAT WE HAVE STORED UP BUT THEY FORCE IT FORCE US THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE IT AWAY SO THAT IT DOESN'T ROT AND IT DOESN'T DROP THEIR PRICES AND THEY VIEW AS LIKE THIS'LL BE A NEW MARKET ONCE THEY CAN AFFORD IT  (fe_03_06913-B-0056)
BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD HATES THAT WE GIVE AWAY SOMETHING LIKE NO WE DON'T EVEN GIVE MORE FOOD THAN MOST OF EUROPE BUT THAT WE GIVE FOOD AID BECAUSE THEY SAY WE'RE DUMPING IT AND CUTTING THEIR PRICES SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU THINK THAT WE GIVE TOO MUCH LIKE IT'S  (fe_03_06913-B-0057)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_06913-B-0059)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06913-B-0060)

MHM HUH THAT THAT'S AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE  (fe_03_06913-B-0063)
I DON'T THINK IT'S AWFUL  (fe_03_06913-B-0064)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06913-B-0065)
MHM  (fe_03_06913-B-0067)
MHM SEE I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AT ALL I MEAN AS I THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER OF COURSE BUT EVERYBODY YOU KNOW NOT EVERYBODY CAN FOCUS ON HOMELESS PEOPLE AND STARVING CHILDREN THERE'S MORE THAN  (fe_03_06913-B-0068)
THAT ISSUE THAT GOES ON I THINK THAT'S LIKE WHAT WE HAVE THAT A LOT OF C- OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TO JUST DEAL WITH IT THE BASIC NEEDS OF SURVIVAL WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE WHY I THINK THAT IT HELPS TO  (fe_03_06913-B-0069)
GIVE OUR EXCESS TO OTHER COUNTRIES BECAUSE I THINK IT HELPS CURB SOME OF THE RESENTMENT THAT'S BUILT UP TOWARDS US BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH  (fe_03_06913-B-0070)
AND THAT'S KIND OF WHY I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH WE CAN FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS THAT ARE A PROBLEM AND  (fe_03_06913-B-0071)
I DON'T KNOW FOR ME I THINK ANIMALS ARE A PRIORITY BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES YOU'VE GOT RABID DOGS AND CATS AND LITTLE KIDS PLAYING WITH THEM AND THEN THEY GET RABIES AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TREAT IT  (fe_03_06913-B-0072)
I MEAN THESE KIDS ARE HALF STARVED ANYWAY SO YOU GET SOME KIND OF DISEASE FROM AN ANIMAL AND IT'S WORSE YOU KNOW AND YOU HAVE ANIMALS THAT ATTACK SMALL CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY'RE WILD AND NO ONE FEEDS 'EM SO IT'S LIKE IF THERE'S NOTHING TO EAT AND THERE'S A LITTLE KID THEY'LL GO AFTER IT  (fe_03_06913-B-0073)
YEAH YEAH BUT I DON'T I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE I THINK WE WE SHOULD BE TEACHING THEM YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE U._S. THAT LIKE AND WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT IT'S GONNA BE OTHER PLACES LIKE I WAS IN PEACE CORPS AND  (fe_03_06913-B-0075)
THEY HAD NEVER SEEN AN AIRPLANE BEFORE UNTIL LIKE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND THEY CALLED IT LIKE THE SILVER OR THE FLYING BOX YOU KNOW IT'S WHICH AND THEY HAD NO IDEA W- LIKE THE MAP THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I COULDN'T GET ON A BUS AND DRIVE HOME TO SEE MY PARENTS WHEN I MISS 'EM  (fe_03_06913-B-0076)
SO IT'S LIKE IT'S HARD TO TO TO FEEL THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T SEE US AS A THREAT BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH SO MUCH THAT  (fe_03_06913-B-0077)
