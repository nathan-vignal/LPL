OKAY UM COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION  (fe_03_06959-B-0011)
WELL UM [NOISE] I THINK COMPUTERS ARE A USEFUL TOOL IN EDUCATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT OUR SOCIETY HAS UM KIND OF PUT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THEM  (fe_03_06959-B-0012)
AND HAS GOTTEN AWAY FROM THE FROM THE BASICS  (fe_03_06959-B-0013)
[NOISE] I AGREE A HUNDRED PERCENT  (fe_03_06959-B-0015)
[NOISE] RIGHT EMAIL IS TAKING THE PLACE OF UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0016)
WRITTEN LETTERS WRITTEN WORD AND UM I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0017)
THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE PLACING MORE EMPHASIS ON COMPUTERS THAN THEY ARE ON LIKE MUSICAL EDUCATION  (fe_03_06959-B-0018)

I'M NOT AGAINST PUBLIC EDUCATION BECAUSE I WENT TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT I THINK THAT IF POSSIBLE THAT A THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN GET YOUR CHILD TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL WHERE THEY ARE  (fe_03_06959-B-0023)

UM WE HAVE MAGNET SCHOOLS WHERE THE CHILDREN CAN UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0030)
WHERE YOU CAN DECIDE  (fe_03_06959-B-0031)
LIKE IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL THEY CAN START GOING TO LIKE A COMPUTER  (fe_03_06959-B-0032)
UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0033)
WHERE THE EMPHASIS IS ON COMPUTERS OR LIKE ON MEDICINE LIKE IF THE CHILD THINKS THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN MEDICAL SCHOOL  (fe_03_06959-B-0034)
AND UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0035)
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD PROGRAM BUT BUT AS FAR AS COMPUTERS I THINK THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO LEARN IT SOONER OR LATER AND UNLESS THE CHILDREN ARE PLANNING ON GOING INTO PROGRAMING  (fe_03_06959-B-0036)
THAT UM YOU KNOW THAT THAT SHOULD COME SECONDARY TO EVERYTHING ELSE  (fe_03_06959-B-0037)
RIGHT EXACTLY AND I MEAN IT'S LIKE WHEN WE WERE IN SCHOOL WE HAD TO DO THE UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0038)

AND I THINK THAT UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0049)
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DANGEROUS INFORMATION COMING FROM THE INTERNET  (fe_03_06959-B-0050)
JUST BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_06959-B-0051)
