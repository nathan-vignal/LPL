'CAUSE I SO WE JUST DIDN'T FINISH THE CALL BUT UM  (fe_03_06986-B-0004)
SO YOU HAVE YOUR INITIAL THOUGHTS  (fe_03_06986-B-0006)
YEAH AND I GUESS THEY SAID DO YOU DO WE FEEL LIKE IT HELPS EDUCATION OR IT HARMS EDUCATION  (fe_03_06986-B-0007)
SU- SURE I GUESS SO  (fe_03_06986-B-0008)
YEAH  (fe_03_06986-B-0009)
SURE I MEAN I UM WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I GRADUATED AT HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO NINETY AND THEY HAD JUST BARELY STARTED EVEN OFFERING  (fe_03_06986-B-0010)
COMPUTER COURSES BUT YOU KNOW JUST THE LAST DECADE YOU JUST YOU HAVE TO REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AN- ANYBODY WHO WOULD BE GRADUATING TODAY I WOULD SUPPOSE WOULD BE AT A REALLY BIG DISADVANTAGE IF THEY ONLY KNEW WHAT I KNEW [LAUGHTER] WHEN I GRADUATED SO  (fe_03_06986-B-0011)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_06986-B-0013)
RIGHT  (fe_03_06986-B-0014)
KEYBOARDING  (fe_03_06986-B-0015)
YEAH BUT DID IT TEACH YOU HOW TO TYPE  (fe_03_06986-B-0017)
'CAUSE WE DID WE DID WE LEARNT ON SOME APPLE PROGRAM HOW TO TYPE IN A MEDIA CENTER IT WAS FUN BUT IT WAS ON THE COMPUTERS BUT THAT'S ALL WE LEARNT HOW TO DO SO [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06986-B-0018)
OH REALLY AH  (fe_03_06986-B-0019)
MAYBE SO  (fe_03_06986-B-0021)
WELL IT SEEMS LIKE UM YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT TO  (fe_03_06986-B-0022)
A LOT OF ADVANTAGES TO THE COMPUTERS JUST BECAUSE IF THEY IF THE CLASS IF THE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET  (fe_03_06986-B-0023)
A BIG ADVANTAGE OF THAT IS THAT YOU CAN GET SO MUCH INFORMATION JUST FROM WHAT SPOT YOU KNOW RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO THE LIBRARY AND FIND THE RIGHT BOOKS WITH THE RIGHT YOU KNOW CHECK THEM ALL OUT AND DO ALL THE RESEARCH LIKE THAT IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE INTERNET WOULD MAKE  (fe_03_06986-B-0024)
MAKE IT FASTER AND EASIER  (fe_03_06986-B-0025)
BUT A DISADVANTAGE LIKE  (fe_03_06986-B-0026)
RIGHT I DON'T EVEN KNOW OF PEOPLE OLD ENOUGH [LAUGHTER] ANY MORE  (fe_03_06986-B-0027)
WE HAD  (fe_03_06986-B-0028)
RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_06986-B-0029)
NOW THE DISADVANTAGE THAT I WOULD SEE OF THAT ESPECIALLY WITH WITH OLDER KIDS LIKE YOU KNOW TEENAGERS IS THAT IF I WAS A PARENT I WOULD BE CON- I KNOW THAT HERE WHERE I LIVE IN VIRGINIA THERE UM  (fe_03_06986-B-0030)
THE SCHOOLS SOME OF THE SCHOOLS IN ONE OF THE COUNTIES AROUND US UM EVERY STUDENT AT HIGH SCHOOL HAS THEIR OWN LAPTOP  (fe_03_06986-B-0031)
WHICH SEEMS KIND OF  (fe_03_06986-B-0032)
NEAT TO SOME DEGREE BUT I WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT MY  (fe_03_06986-B-0033)
THAT MY TEENAGER HAVE JUST ACCESS TO ANYTHING  (fe_03_06986-B-0034)
I MEAN 'CAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH THERE'S SO MUCH THEY WELL IT'S IT'S ISSUED BY THE SCHOOL AND I AND I GUESS THEY I DON'T THINK THEY GET TO KEEP IT FOREVER THEY PROBABLY HAVE TO RETURN IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR BUT THEY THEY KEEP IT WITH THEM THEY TAKE IT HOME THEY TAKE IT TO ALL THEIR CLASSES  (fe_03_06986-B-0035)
AND I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF ADVANTAGES TO THAT BUT I WOULD WORRY THAT MY CHILD WOULD GO EXPLORING TOO MUCH ON THE INTERNET AND  (fe_03_06986-B-0036)
SOME TYPE OF CONTROLS BUT I KNOW THEY'VE HAD THE THE FIRST YEAR ANYWAY THAT THEY HAD 'EM IT WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS' AGO I REMEMBER HEARING IT ON THE NEWS THAT THEY THEY HAD TO RECALL THEM ALL ALL THE STUDENTS HAD TO BRING THEM BACK IN FOR A DIFFERENT  (fe_03_06986-B-0037)
YOU KNOW SO THEY COULD INSTALL DIFFERENT SOFTWARE TO KEEP THEM FROM GOING HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE  (fe_03_06986-B-0038)
BUT I GUESS IF THEY COULD IF THERE ARE WAYS TO TO KEEP TRACK ON THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T THEN THAT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD THING JUST BECAUSE  (fe_03_06986-B-0039)
OH THAT'S GOOD IF THEY COULD KEEP YOU KNOW SO SO IF I HAD A TEENAGE CHILD AND I KNEW THAT WOULD THAT THEY WERE GOING TO USE IT ONLY FOR THEIR SCHOOL WORK I THINK IT'D BE GREAT  (fe_03_06986-B-0041)
SURE  (fe_03_06986-B-0042)
AND THE WAY EVERYTHING IS DONE IN BUSINESS AND IN HEALTHCARE AND ALL THOSE POTENTIAL CAREERS OUT THERE IS YOU KNOW COMPUTERS ARE SOMEHOW INTEGRATED YOU KNOW FROM A LITTLE BIT TO A LOT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S HARDLY A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO  (fe_03_06986-B-0043)
GOT A COMPUTER AT SOME POINT  (fe_03_06986-B-0044)
MHM  (fe_03_06986-B-0046)
MHM  (fe_03_06986-B-0048)
SURE  (fe_03_06986-B-0049)
MHM  (fe_03_06986-B-0050)
SO THEY'RE I MEAN I GUESS IT'S MOSTLY HELPFUL TO THE KIDS IT'S BECAUSE WHEN THEY ONCE THEY'RE GROWN UP AND HAVE TO MAKE THEIR CHOICES THEN THEY'RE THEY CAN INTEGRATE WHEREVER THEY FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO AS FAR AS WHATEVER CAREER THEY CHOOSE AND  (fe_03_06986-B-0051)
[SIGH] AND OTHER AND DIFFERENT JOBS WHERE THEY WOULD BRING IN NEW COMPUTERS AND THEY HAD TO TEACH EVERYBODY HOW TO USE IT IT WAS KIND OF  (fe_03_06986-B-0052)
YOU KNOW IT'D KIND OF PUT A STOP TO ALL THE WORK  (fe_03_06986-B-0053)
FOR A WHILE EVERYBODY JUST LEARNED HOW TO USE THE PROGRAMS AND THEN THERE'S A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO SO  (fe_03_06986-B-0054)
THAT WOULD BE GOOD I GUESS ANOTHER AREA WHERE IT MIGHT BE HARMFUL WOULD  (fe_03_06986-B-0055)
UM  (fe_03_06986-B-0056)
NOT THAT IT'S EVEN IMPORTANT BUT IT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MANY HOW MUCH CHIL- KIDS ACTUALLY  (fe_03_06986-B-0057)
WRITE THINGS OUT ANYMORE LIKE MAYBE MATHS BUT BUT YOU KNOW I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I MEAN EVERY REPORT THAT I DID WAS HAND WRITTEN AND I IMAGINE THAT MOST OF THE TEACHERS GET THEIR REPORTS IN  (fe_03_06986-B-0058)
IN THEIR COMPUTER THAT ARE THAT ARE PRINTED OUT  (fe_03_06986-B-0059)
MAKE IT EASY TO READ BUT  (fe_03_06986-B-0060)
I GUESS THAT'S NOT A BAD THING AT ALL I DON'T KNOW EXCEPT THE  (fe_03_06986-B-0061)
YOU'RE NEEDING TO KNOW HOW TO WRITE I GUESS I DON'T KNOW [LAUGHTER] BUT  (fe_03_06986-B-0062)
IT JUST SEEMS STRANGE TO ME  (fe_03_06986-B-0063)
YEAH I SUPPOSE NOT  (fe_03_06986-B-0064)
MHM  (fe_03_06986-B-0065)
I CAN'T  (fe_03_06986-B-0066)
RIGHT I KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK I THINK THAT ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM HANDWRITING WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY FOCUS ON THAT ANYMORE  (fe_03_06986-B-0067)
MHM IT'S TRUE  (fe_03_06986-B-0069)
DO THE COMPUTER KEYBOARD RIGHT ALONG WITH LEARNING HOW TO WRITE THEIR LETTERS I IMAGINE I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_06986-B-0072)
I HAVE UM LIKE MY OLDEST ARE ENTERING KINDERGARTEN THIS YEAR I HAVE TWINS AND SO THIS WILL BE MY FIRST EXPERIENCE I KNOW THEY HAVE UM  (fe_03_06986-B-0073)

CLASSROOM IN THEIR KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM SO  (fe_03_06986-B-0075)
AND THAT I THINK THAT SHE SAID THERE'S LIKE SEVEN IN EACH CLASSROOM SO I'LL I'LL BE INTERESTED TO FIND OUT WHAT  (fe_03_06986-B-0076)

JUST LISTENING TO THE TEACHER DO WHATEVER HE OR SHE DOES  (fe_03_06986-B-0083)
