L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]  My name is Lisa, how are you?
R:  I'm well, how are you?
L:  Uh, I'm doing fine. [LAUGH]
R:  My name is Gabby.
L:  Gabby?
R:  Yeah --
L:  W- --
R:  -- and we're supposed to be talking about comedy and --
L:  About comedy, mhm.
R:  And how the line of bad taste happens and [NOISE], uh, where would we draw the line?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, uh, I think that the most appropriate place that bad taste humor is not allowed is at work.  And I know, I used to have a boss that was so horrible --
L:  Oh my gosh!
R:  -- at telling jokes that were just so inappropriate.  I mean --
L:  They're like, off -- off them -- off -- way off the mark.
R:  I mean, just completely off the wall jokes that, I mean, and it was my boss, so you know how you kinda have to be polite --
L:  You kinda go uh-huh --
R:  -- about laughing?
L:  Uh, uh-huh. [LAUGH] --
R:  It was --
L:  -- and you kinda go, "Uh-huh, uh-huh". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, and I mean, my eyebrows, I guess, told the whole story that I was just not approving it and, you know, you politely make your way out as soon as possible, but jeez, it was just -- I mean, just bad taste jokes like --
L:  Mhm.  Hey, did you --
R:  -- a- about --
L:  -- have any children?
R:  No I don't.
L:  You don't.
R:  Yeah.  M- --
L:  Okay.  'Cause we -- you see, we have to watch 'cause we have friends that tell stuff off -- off the mark and we have kids.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  So it's kinda like -- y- yeah.  So I mean, you had to kinda say, "Oh no, that's not like, really appropriate for them to hear" 'cause we have a twelve year old and then a -- a [MN] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] soon to be three and soon to be five, so we have to kinda watch that too.
R:  Oh yeah, no, most definitely.  I +remember my dad used to do that all the time when he'd have his friends over and -- and his friends were about, "Let me tell you this joke" he was like, "Uh, let's go over here" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  So [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Let's go i- --
R:  I knew what it was about.
L:  -- in a different place, yeah.  I have not, um -- I'm trying to think if I have encountered that at work or not.  I don't know if I have encountered that at work more than --
R:  Yeah, but you're not supposed to encounter that at work.  I always -- you know how when you read the pamphlets on harassment, on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all kinds of things that you're not supposed to do, you would think people would at least --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thumb through them.
L:  Oh, and if [LAUGH] --
R:  -- but I just -- I -- it's very bizarre that, you know, my boss who I thought, you know, at first, you know, I was -- he was highly respected in my book but as soon as he said that one comment I was like, "Okay, well maybe it was a slip up and he honestly doesn't think that that's inappropriate".
L:  Off the mark, mhm.
R:  Yeah.  But he knows -- he knows where to push the envelope 'cause he kept on saying stuff like that.  I mean, I -- I don't understand how he didn't get it, how every time he was about to start a story I'd be like, "Oh, I gotta do this".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Oh, I gotta do that".  You know, so ...
L:  Um, did you just end up -- is it your boss currently?
R:  Oh no, no --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no, no. [LAUGH]
L:  How did you finally say some- -- or did you fin- ever say anything to him?
R:  No.  No, no, I -- yeah, I could never bring myself to -- to point it out.  I mean, everybody knew it though, that's what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They -- they -- everybody let him get away with it 'cause they would listen to him.
L:  [SIGH] Well, and he's the boss and they felt like if they said something, probably that they would not be allowed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be allowed to do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they -- or they would get fired or something like that.
R:  Most definite.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  And he -- and he would do something like that.
L:  Oh!
R:  You know?  So people wouldn't -- yeah, I -- I guess people felt that out 'cause he would do something inappropriate like fire you in case you didn't like his jokes, he would.
L:  R- right.  Or he was saying something --
R:  So --
L:  -- or -- or he maybe he maybe didn't think that he was saying something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so far off the mark or something.  Isn't that wild?  Now I don't think -- like, the -- we, um, our family's really good and, um, you know, my husband's family is really good about it, especially around the kids, but we've been around other people where, um, if I -- if they've said something kind of uncomfortable I'll just kinda look at my husband, like, "I'm not --" and I'll just kind of walk away or, um -- do you think that women tell more off the mark, or men?
R:  Well, I mean, in my -- in my scenario I -- I've just seen men do it but, I mean, I'm -- I'm never out purposely looking for it.  One of the things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that also had happened to me is the -- uh, when I first met my, um, husband's parents --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, I thought, you know, everything was gonna be okay and they were having a party over at his house, so a bunch of people came over and then it got right into the evening and some gentlemen started drinking and in the middle of the whole circle, [LAUGH] was Chris's dad, [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh no!
R:  Oh, yes, to my horror --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- this is the first time I meet them and all this, you know, great disaster, I'm like, "Oh my goodness, is this how he is all the time?"  And it turns out that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that was really once in a lifetime --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it really was, 'cause he had a --
L:  He --
R:  -- bit too much that day.
L:  Much to drink.
R:  Oh --
L:  Well, do you think people do that too?  Exce- well, I guess if your boss didn't 'cause he wouldn't be drinking on the job, but do you think alcohol influences it at all?
R:  Oh most definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Most definitely.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  That just b- [MN], you know, uh, blurs the line of, you know, "Hey, is this appropriate or not?"  I mean, you don't think rationally when you're telling a joke in the first place, uh, but -- but he was telling strangers these jokes like, he didn't know if, you know, like jokes --
L:  Oh no!
R:  -- about people -- people that, you know, he may have [MN] said a joke about -- like, something about parents, and he didn't know that half the room were parents or something like that, you know what I mean?  So --
L:  Oh no!
R:  -- yeah, it was -- it was pretty bad.
L:  Bless his heart!
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- I -- I made myself quietly out of the room.  Uh, that's how I deal with --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it 'cause I'm not the -- I'm not a confrontational person to say, "Oh my God, that is so ridiculous, stop that" you know?  And [MN] I first met him, you know, I'm in his house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I couldn't say anything.
L:  No.  See, I probably couldn't have done that either, I probably would've done what you did and just kind of -- kinda maneuvered myself out and just kind of --
R:  And sometimes I -- I think that if I don't say anything I'm condoning it.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes I think though -- sometimes I think other people get the idea that -- that you're -- without you saying anything, sometimes I think people still get it.  I still think, you know, if y- uh, if -- I don't know, I don't think people are that blind to, um, [LIPSMACK] that blind --
R:  But I -- I wish I was strong enough to say, "Hey, you know what?  Uh, I don't care to listen to that at work" or you know what I mean?  Like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would love to be a powerhouse where I could be like, "You know what?  That's really inappropriate and I wish you wouldn't say that, you know --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- at work".  But yeah, right, I -- I mean, I'm not.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just like [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, no, I'm not -- I'm not confrontational either and so I probably -- I'm -- I'm with you, I probably could not step up to the plate at work because I -- especially if you needed the job, you know, 'cause sometimes if you need a job you're a little bit more reserved in -- in how you would approach somebody if they are saying something --
R:  Most definitely.
L:  -- off color.
R:  You're right.  As a matter of fact th- you're right because at the end of my stay at that job, I used to work for Toys R. Us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and at the end of my stay, um, you know, before I -- I decided to turn in my resignation letter, I was a lot more free with what I wanted to say, I'd say, "You know what?  I don't like that".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "I never have and [several inaudible words] to stop" [LAUGH].  So, uh --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, right before I resigned I, you know, I -- that gave me a little extra push in the power --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- mode and --
L:  And well -- and sometimes --
R:  -- it -- it feels good.
L:  -- it's like -- yeah, well, sometimes I think what happens too is that people take it and then you -- they -- you don't know they might have had a big turnover as far as that goes, because of him [SIGH], you know --
R:  Oh, I guarantee you there is.  I know some people because of him --
L:  Oh! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh girl!  Oh no.  He was bad.  I mean, 'cause people that --
L:  How old was he?
R:  He was, um, he was about forty five.  But he was -- he was always talking about women in inappropriate ways, and then one time we had a company trip to New York and he came back saying that, um, he -- they were riding around in the limo and they almost ran over some prostitutes and, I mean, just at work.  I mean, it's like, y- you know, I don't -- I don't know you that way.
L:  Right.
R:  I know you as my financial advisor --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of what we used to do with our P&Ls, don't go anywhere else --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know what I mean?
L:  Don't go --
R:  That's all --
L:  -- in other direction.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Was he married?  Was he married?
R:  No.  Well, he was so bitter towards marriage 'cause he had three wives and he's working on a fourth one always.
L:  Oh my gosh.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Mhm.
R:  He is always working on a fourth one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what he always says.
L:  You know?  And then when I told him --
R:  How funny.
L:  -- you know, uh, w- I told him I needed two weeks off for my wedding, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he was like, "I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry you're gonna do that" you know?  It was just like, "Well thank you for your support but I don't really care what you think 'cause, you know, you're not on the lines of where I wanna go, so ..."  It w- -- it was sad.
L:  Oh, and, uh, now where do you live at?  Do you live ...?  D- --
R:  I -- I live -- right now I'm calling from Texas.  I don't know if --
L:  I live in Arkansas.
R:  Oh, well that's not too far.
L:  So you're cl- -- you're pretty close.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's pretty close.  Well see, I'm in -- originally from California and I had, um, I was really good 'cause I had bosses that were really good as far as that was concerned and they, um, you know, they didn't do -- I mean, I had, uh, they would say some things but nothing really that was so offensive that I would go, you know, "Don't --"
R:  No, there's -- he was slimy.
L:  So I was really lucky.  Yeah.
R:  You are lucky.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, all my other -- all my other bosses --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- aren't like that, and I mean, I do th- -- I think he was just the one guy but -- but he was just --
L:  And sometimes one is enough. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No, yeah.  It did creep me out.  It was just like, "Is this what it's gonna be like forever?" so --
L:  Oh, how wild.
R:  No.
L:  Now, are you planning on having children?
R:  Yes.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.  I al- --
L:  Now, when somebody -- if somebody came up to you in front of your children and said something like that do you think you'd be able to say something?
R:  Oh yeah, no, yeah most definitely.  I -- I -- I feel like you have to be really protective, especially with what's on TV right now, on -- I mean, on normal hours --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for like from -- from, I mean, I know that Friends is a funny adult --
L:  [NOISE] [NOISE]
R:  -- show --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they play, like, the reruns at, you know, right after school.
L:  Uh hm.
R:  Like, three thirty i- on, I mean --
L:  Uh [LAUGH]
R:  -- kids can see that, they have inappropriate --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- inappropriate innuendos that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you come across in the little script that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, some of the kids might ask, "Hey, what does that mean?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And what are you gonna say, "Hey, you know, don't say that" you know?  Of course you're gonna say that, you're gonna find out what it means --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  --  you know, so --
L:  Well, it's really funny 'cause I have a stepdaughter and sometimes they, um, it's weird that you said that 'cause sometimes they say, in the other house that she's in, they treat her more like an adult sometimes and so they --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- say, you know, they [SIGH] she's, uh, surrounded by adults more than -- than usual, and sometimes she'll say things that she thinks are funny, I'm thinking -- and I have to tell her, you know, "That's not appropriate for a twelve year old".
R:  Right.
L:  You know, "That's not what twelve year olds normally say".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so she kinda has to look at me and, um, [LIPSMACK] so I think sometimes [COUGH] the kids [MN] --
R:  But don't you -- oh, is that your twelve year old?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, that's my twelve year old.
R:  Okay.  But she's in a --
L:  Yeah, well, it's my -- it's my husband's twelve --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- year old, yeah.  But, I mean, [MN] we've been together for s- --
R:  In front of your -- your other --
L:  Um --
R:  -- ones, your younger ones, right?
L:  Right.  My other ones are, um --
R:  Five and three.
L:  Yeah, five and three.  Or soon to be.
R:  Mm.
L:  Each of 'em, they're just, uh, like, twenty months apart, so
