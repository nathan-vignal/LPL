L:  Hi, there.
R:  Hi.  My name is Josephine.
L:  Hi, I'm Dana.
R:  Oh, hi, Dana.  I am ...
L:  I'm in California.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Hawaii.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, wow!  Okay.  You're a long way away.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Not too bad.
L:  Well, this is only the second one of these I've done.  So, I guess I'm getting a little more used to it, um ...
R:  [NOISE] This is the first one I've -- I'm doing.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you just start talking basically.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But anyway I guess the topic was life partners.  What -- what do you look for in a life partner?  What would be your view on that?
R:  What do I look for in a life partner?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I think ...
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
L:  Oh ...
R:  Do -- do you have something you wanna say?
L:  No.  No.  No.  You go ahead.
R:  I think the first -- the most important thing for me would be somebody who, um, serves God first and then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- somebody who's a -- a family person, loves kids, has a lot of humor.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know, it's funny because I was thinking about that and the first thing that popped into my mind I think was honesty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know -- and when you said someone who -- who serves God well, that kinda covers it all, doesn't it?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean -- I mean, basically -- I mean, if they're -- if they're truly -- you know, do -- are trying to -- to -- to be the way that -- that God wants them to be then automatically they're gonna be honest.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, um ...  Are you married or ...?
R:  Yes, I am.  I'm married and I have three kids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, are you married?
L:  Well, actually I am divorced, but I, um -- my ex husband and I are sort of trying to work things out.  But, um, we do have two children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you -- do you feel that -- that -- that your life partner meets your standards for honest- --
R:  You know ...
L:  -- you know, for being a religious -- you know, following God's word or ...?
R:  Uh, well, I -- I too was divorced before --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I got remarried and I think that the thing that makes the difference is that I -- I changed and I'm not playing such -- placing such high expectations --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on him, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I'm just trying to go about this in a realistic way I guess.
L:  Well ...
R:  That we're realizing that everybody makes mistakes and you gotta allow for that.
L:  Yeah.  That's definitely true 'cause that's -- I guess that's kinda the situation I'm in as well, it's just with the same guy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, he -- he and I both definitely made mistakes.  So, we're trying to come back to accepting those and -- and moving forward.  But I guess that goes back to -- to where my -- my point was honesty.  I think if you -- if you can have that honesty of knowing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, that you can go to the other person and say, "Hey, I've screwed up" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that that ...
R:  Honesty's definitely important --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- 'cause if you don't have that trust how do you, you know ...?  'Cause with honesty comes trust --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because if you don't -- yeah -- if you don't feel like the other person is being honest with you how are you gonna trust them?
L:  Right.  And, um, that's something -- 'cause I think that's -- in my situation that's what we're both a little weary of is trusting the other person and, you know -- I don't know.  It's just -- relationships are hard.
R:  It's great that you guys are trying to work it out though, you know?
L:  Yeah.  You know --
R:  That's ...
L:  -- we've -- just with kids it's so hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's so hard not to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, huh --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- I guess -- relationships are crazy and sometimes I almost think it would be perfect if we just lived in a duplex, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If we each had our own house [LAUGH] and -- right beside each other it would be great.
R:  Gee, that would be great.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know.  I don't know why that option hasn't been explored more.  Um, goodness, I don't know how much longer we need to talk.  [LAUGH]  That's the --
R:  I know.  Really.
L:  -- that's the thing what I was doing the first one.  I was like oh, my gosh.  I've got to keep talking.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I never did one of these before and I thought oh, my gosh, what time am I gonna put -- pick -- put, you know, for people to call because I live in Hawaii and I don't know, what time is it there where you're at?
L:  It's nine o'clock here.
R:  Yeah, it's only six here.
L:  Oh, you're only three hours behind us.
R:  Yeah.  Three hours.  Not too bad.
L:  I guess ...  Well, now I have a friend who moved to Hawaii, but I lived in Georgia at the time so it seemed like she was so --
R:  Far away.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- completely opposite, but she was six hours then.  So, yeah, I guess it is just three hours now.
R:  Yeah.  From Georgia I would think that would be six hours.
L:  Yeah, because it's ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, three hours here -- and there, um ...  Huh.
R:  How -- how old are your kids?
L:  Mine are eight and ten.
R:  Well, that's a good age.  My kids are all little.  I have a four year old, one that's almost gonna be two, and a four month old.
L:  Oh, my gosh!  You have your hands full.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Well, now, do you get to stay at home or ...?
R:  Yes.  I just stay at home waiting for them to get older.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  You think it -- I always thought it would get easier, but it seems like there's just more stuff.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At least when they were all preschool and little I could kinda control what was going on.  Now it's "I've gotta go to soccer.  I've gotta go to basketball.  I've gotta go to Girl Scouts".  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I'm just starting that.  I just started.  My daughter's taking band classes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and her swim classes, my oldest one, and I thought oh, my gosh, what am I gonna do when they're all doing that?
L:  I -- it's hard.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it really is.  Luckily I have a lotta Moms around here, we kinda all work together to get people where they need to go.  [LAUGH]  So, you know, it works.
R:  Well, that's nice.  That's nice.
L:  Um ...
R:  That works.
L:  Huh.
R:  Uh, what else about the topic?  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  That's what I was thinking, like oh, you're really talking about the topic.  Um, let's see.
R:  What's ...?
L:  Life partner, um ...
R:  Yeah, life partner.  What else would I look for in someone?  I -- I guess something really important for me is somebody who is -- mirth and not so serious.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because then we come across situations you don't have -- it's not too intense, you know?
L:  Right.  You know, I think that is important because, you know, you've gotta -- when you can kinda roll with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you -- 'cause, I mean, stuff happens.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Stuff you never think in a million years could come your way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I know that -- I mean, I think that's true of everybody --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and if you've got somebody who -- who can at least take it with a grain of salt and smile through it -- it's gonna be hard.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Either way it's gonna be hard.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's gonna be hard, but at -- at least it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you at least say you can smile while it's hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, 'cause I know like one of the -- a guy I dated, um -- we've been divorced almost three years --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and a guy I dated in between he just was so uptight and so serious.  He was never -- could never have joy in his life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's like, you know what?  Loosen up.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like it's -- it's not all bad.
R:  Oh, yeah
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- let's see.  I'm trying to think of anything else I look for in a partner.  I wish I could say I looked for a lotta money, but I don't.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Money.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Somehow it's not as important -- it's not as important and it shouldn't be, but it'd be nice.
R:  No.
L:  Um ...
R:  It can make things easier sometimes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, it definitely can, um, but that's not what I look for.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  Let's see.  Well ...
R:  I think ...
L:  Oh, go ahead.
R:  How, um -- being -- being divorced with children -- when I was divorced I never had any kids.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How was that?
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Was it difficult or ...?
L:  It was difficult, but I have to say that my ex husband and I have always been fairly good friends, except for maybe the -- I would say maybe the first eight months afterwards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- were bad.  But after that we kinda came to an understanding that we've got to make it work and, you know, it -- it is hard on kids.  I don't care how many people say oh, they'll get over it or they'll be okay, it's -- it's hard, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They don't know ...  Luckily I think mine were young enough that it wasn't so traumatic.  But, you know -- and we -- we did split custody, we had joint, both -- each -- each had a week --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is the way we worked it 'cause we lived fairly close together and even that, you know, you -- who's got the shoes at what house and --
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's right.
L:  -- and who's got ...  You know, it was just kinda ...
R:  And who's gonna drive who where and when and ...
L:  Right.  And, um -- and even beyond that they just -- you know, I don't think kids of any age understand why you're getting a divorce, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that they get kinda scared --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um, I -- honestly I think mine have handled it as well as any kids can but, um -- and that's the one thing I'm worried about right now with us trying to get back together is if for some reason it doesn't work out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- God, they've gotta go through it twice.
R:  Yeah, and then it'll be hard for them.  Yeah.
L:  So [LIPSMACK], I guess we've gotta make it work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I will say one thing about my ex husband [LAUGH] that's very positive.  He, um, um -- let's see -- in terms of a life partner he, um -- well, I'm trying to think of something [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, other we've mentioned.  I think for the most part he is now honest and he's funny.  Um, let's see.  But -- but he is a very good father.  I mean, I think he understands that responsibility --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I think if you -- if you want children that that's something that's important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I don't know.
R:  Wow!  Ten minutes is a long time.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  It's a long time, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  I didn't think it would be this long.
L:  Um, the first one I did was like on the public education system and it was like, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
