L:  [COUGH]
R:  Hello, I'm Amy.
L:  Hi, I'm Peggy.
R:  Hello.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  How -- how are you?
L:  [COUGH] Doing fine.  Uh, where are you from?
R:  I am from West Virginia.
L:  West Virginia?
R:  Yes.
L:  I'm from Arkansas.
R:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] I was -- I was calling about the topic of the day --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- which was the minimum wage.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, our minimum wage is five fifteen here as well and, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't feel that that is enough.
L:  Uh, I agree, uh, it -- it's not enough to live on, uh, with things costing the way they do, uh, every time you go to the grocery store you're paying a higher price.  Uh, automobiles cost more, uh, utilities have gone up, uh, as well, and, uh, the minimum wage is like, five fifteen an hour is just not enough for people to live.
R:  Right, I agree.  Um, I know that, um, my husband has to work two jobs here, um, just to make enough to live on to keep off of, you know, welfare.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, 'cause, you know, we don't want to be on welfare.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, he has to work two full time jobs just to make enough money to provide our food and shelter, just your basics.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  And I think that it needs to be, um, raised.
L:  [MN]
R:  Quite a bit.
L:  I -- yeah, yeah.  Uh, and because y- you go up [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You -- you go to fill out an application at -- at a, uh, uh, what- whatever, uh, that would normally pay a minimum wage and -- and most applications ask what you want, you know, in the way of salary, and you -- you put down anything above minimum wage, they don't look twice at the application.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, that's just my opinion.  But employers don't wanna pay more than that [NOISE] --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and I can understand why because, you know, things are -- are more expensive for the employer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as well as the person, you know, seeking the employment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh, what -- what the government needs to do, instead of just, you know, raising the m- minimum wage, is to cut out all the wasteful spending [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and, uh, uh, cut down on some of their outrageous salaries --
R:  I --
L:  -- and -- and, uh, uh, l- lower, uh, well, get rid of, uh, or make the taxes more fair.
R:  Right.
L:  Instead of getting -- instead of giving tax cuts, uh, which benefit mostly the rich.  Let -- let's make the taxes more fair.
R:  Right.  Well, you know, like with the taxes, you know, they held out federal and state and local taxes out of our tax[?].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then when you go to the grocery store you're taxed for your groc- -- I mean, I don't know about there --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- but we're -- here we're taxed for our groceries --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anything that we're buying, you know, we're taxed --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for as well.  So really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're not making anything --
L:  No.
R:  -- by the -- by the time we pay taxes to our government and to our grocery stores, everything that we purchase.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And now we're not making enough money to really live on.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  And then they wonder why the poverty levels are so high, you know.
L:  Mhm.  And -- and we're supposed to be the richest nation on earth.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That, uh, half of our people, you know, living in poverty are just barely above poverty, uh, you know.  And, uh, they -- they -- instead of giving all this money to poorer nations --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they need to start giving it to the people that need it.
R:  Well I agree, I agree.  I think that, um, you know, that people here in the United States should come first.
L:  Yes --
R:  You know.
L:  -- exactly.  Exactly.  They need to take care of people here at home.
R:  Right.  You know, I manage --
L:  Before they go giving money to other countries.  I can understand why they want to.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I --
L:  You know, it -- it's good relations, you know, and, uh, trade and all that sorta stuff, that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wonderful.  But the thing is, they need to take care of their home first.
R:  Right.  Well, you know, there's children here that are homeless and -- and people that are homeless and starving, just as well as they [inaudible] in other countries.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  But I think that the United States should be their first priority and if they raised the minimum wage then more people wouldn't want to work and stay on welfare.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mm.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I think that, uh, it would cut a lot of the welfare and things out.  And [several inaudible words] therefore that would help them too.  You know, help the government and help the people.
L:  Well, it w- -- I think it would help businesses too.  People would have more money to spend.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, peop- people that are service based, uh, businesses or -- or, uh, certain goods like TVs and cars and stuff like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that people, uh, uh, get for their everyday comforts, you know, they would have more money to spend on these things.  And -- and they -- they, uh, uh, would have less, uh, less people, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on poverty --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, spending the government's money that way.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, with Medicaid and, uh, all the other, uh, poverty programs that they have.  They'd be spending less in there because people want to do for themselves, people want --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to work and -- and have a nice living --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, for themselves and their families.  You know, uh, they -- they don't want this government assistance, they'd rather do it on their own.
R:  Uh, right.
L:  They need to give 'em the means to do so.
R:  Mm.  Yes, I -- you know, I agree.  I think that, uh, a- and you know, by w- raising the minimum wage therefore they would be helping, um, people here, you know, by wanting to work, cutting out the welfare programs and the government assistant programs and, you know, a lotta people do want to work but the minimum wage, you know, I know here in West Virginia, well the welfare benefits are higher than the minimum wage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, they're not gonna work if they can get more --
L:  Why -- why would they want to?
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Why would they want to?
R:  Right.  And they can get more food stamps and more checks from the government than minimum wage. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  And -- and people, you know, that -- that, uh, are, you know, facing retirement, uh, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if -- if -- if they can't save enough to make a living --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- uh, you know, how are they gonna contribute, uh, to their own retirement?
R:  Right.  Well that's like us, you know, we -- me and my husband's been married thirteen years and, um, which I've had some college education but he hasn't, and, you know, he has to work two jobs and then I have to work, and you know, we just barely, you know, have what we need.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And we can't really save anything towards retirement.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, because the money that we do make --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- needs to be spent on what we have to have now.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And -- and, uh, you know, what are our -- what are our children facing?
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  A- as far as the workforce in the future.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you know, there -- there's as many jobs available, uh, uh, without [NOISE], you know, needing college, uh, as there are th- those with college education but, uh, uh, i- if they can't make a living, uh, w- with the minimum wage, then, uh, you know, what are our children gonna face in -- in the future as far as jobs and homelessness and ...?
R:  Right.  Yeah, I know I worry about -- I have two daughters and I worry about them and I encourage -- try to instill values in them that -- to -- to go to college, you know, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from our area there's not a lotta people that, you know, attend college.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And, you know, I try to encourage them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "You have to go to college in order to have an education, to be able to make enough money to live on".  But you know what's --
L:  That's something else that's gone up, is the college tuition.  I heard on --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the news just the other day, college tuition all over the country has gone up.
R:  It has.  Uh, that's because the economy is so bad --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, everything has just, you know, been raising and people are losing jobs and it's been really hard.
L:  Right and left.
R:  Yes.
L:  Right and left.  Yeah, uh, uh, state governments, uh, are having to lay off hundreds of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, because the state just can't afford it, they're not getting the federal money that they used to get [NOISE], you know, and so these people are unemployed.  And -- and, uh, they have to go out there and try to find a job and if it only pays minimum wage, five fifteen an hour, how can they live?  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  You know, it's been, um, five fifteen for a long time here and I just think that they need to raise, and I think they need to raise it at least to seven dollars.  At least.
L:  At least.
R:  Yeah.  At least.
L:  At least.  Because the, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it just -- it just doesn't cut it.
R:  No, it doesn't.
L:  Uh, it just, you know, and, uh, uh, I don't know what the answer is.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I really don't know what the answer is.  Uh, you know, if -- if things keep going up how are people gonna live?
R:  Right.
L:  I --
R:  And then too, you know, with, if -- if minimum wage does raise
