R:  Christina Brerer[?] [NOISE].
L:  Hi, my name is Veronica, I'm -- I live in Arizona.
R:  Hi, I'm Chris, I live in, um, New Jersey.
L:  Okay.  I guess we're supposed to talk about comi- acceptable comedy or humor?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]  Um --
L:  Okay.  Um, I don't know. [LAUGH]  I just don't like anybody that talks about people in the offensive manner.  You know, I mean, whether it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- because of like, I guess discriminate- discriminatory comments.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I'd rather listen to people who were, you know, non ethnical with making a joke and also, uh, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] people who generally aren't vulgar. You know, you don't need to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- curse. [NOISE]  They don't need to curse or anything like that [NOISE] to, uh [NOISE] to be funny. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, totally. [COUGH]
R:  And I think too, you know, depending on, especially comedy in T- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on TV, they have to be -- be careful that it's not too sexual because of kids watching.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  I think --
L:  -- unfortunately I think most shows --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't let my kids watch, like, "You guys should go in the other room or turn off --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- the TV" 'cause it's bad.
R:  Because, you know, you have so many comedy that's really funny and they don't use any vulgarity and they just make li- -- make light of everyday life, which I think is the comedy I prefer, as to, you know, the one that's very ethnical or discriminatory, you know, or, you know, putting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people down to make themselves feel good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think that's terrible.
L:  Yeah, that is bad.  Hm.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] I [NOISE] --
R:  I'm trying to think what else.  Well, I have a friend that's a comedian and his -- I haven't gone to see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- him in a while but he was pretty funny.  And he -- what he does is, he uses --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everyday life experiences.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And th- they're really great, they -- it's just funny because there's a l- -- and I prefer improv as opposed to, you know, this comedy sketch that is all laid out, because you really don't know how people are gonna take it.
L:  Right.  Yeah, there is that new comedy, I don't know, Last Comic Standing or something?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  I haven't watched them.
L:  [MN] I watch it because I only get two channels and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it happens to be on one of 'em! [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  But th- they weren't too bad.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, and the ones that did talk about ethnic, they talked about their own ethnicity.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  I guess that was to, you know, not offend anybody.
R:  You see, that I don't have a problem with because, you know, that's kind of your everyday life.
L:  Right.
R:  And usually you're not very derogatory, you're just kind of saying, you know, "Well, you know, I'm this ethnic -- [LIPSMACK] I'm this --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- I have this kind of background and we generally do this".
L:  Right, and --
R:  You know, that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't think I have that much of a problem, but [inaudible] --
L:  No, I don't either, I s- -- yeah, it's the people that are talking about the other --
R:  Right.
L:  -- race that --
R:  And they're nasty about it, you know, it just seems so --
L:  And it's not to be --
R:  -- -grading.
L:  Yeah, it's not to -- I don't know.  I think those people are just ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- just --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I don't know, not happy with themselves or maybe they --
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  -- had a bad experience, I don't know.
R:  That must be it because I know that, you know -- and you hear a lot of comedians now without using profane language and they're good, you know, you don't have to be profane to be funny.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I mean, even if you look --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at Saturday -- what is it, Saturday Night Live?
L:  Saturday Night Live.
R:  They're usually pretty funny and they're not vulgar. [NOISE] 
L:  No, you know, they're not.  They just --
R:  But they're --
L:  -- make fun of people! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but they make fun of everybody --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it's kinda like -- and, you know, the other comedy I don't mind is when they make fun of actors of presidents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because, I mean, if you accept that job then you have to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- know that people are gonna make fun of ya, that's just part of the job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  And I -- yeah, 'cause, uh, I don't know, like the past couple of nights I've been watch [inaudible] -- up late watching Jay Leno.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he has some funny things.
R:  Mm.
L:  I never really watched him before and it's funny. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, some of -- and he is really -- he'd -- I don't think he goes overboard.  Like, have you ever heard of Howard Stern?
L:  Oh --
R:  Like, he's overboard.
L:  He's just -- I think he's nasty.
R:  Right.  I -- I think, you know, he takes it to -- although I would think a lot of people feel the same way he does, he just goes over the top.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In my opinion.  You know, it's not comedy, it runs to nastiness.
L:  Yeah, he's -- yeah.  I -- that's one person I don't like.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't listen to him either but, you know, he always makes the news or something, somebody's always talking about him. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  But I really tend to [MN] I prefer improv because you know what?  It's usually a topic and it can go any way.
L:  Right.
R:  And it just becomes very funny because you have no clue where the next person is gonna take it, or bring it back.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] Although some of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- those I guess can get a little racy. [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE]  I don't know. [NOISE] 
L:  I don't know what else we're supposed to talk about! [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Is this the first time you've done one?
L:  I did one once, like a month ago.
R:  [NOISE] I [inaudible].
L:  And I don't remember what it was.  I have no --
R:  Well, this is my first one so ... [NOISE]
L:  Usually they're sitting on my answering machine with the recording of, you know, this -- that lady.
R:  [several inaudible words].  [SIGH] Do you find that men are funnier than women?
L:  [LIPSMACK] You know what?  I think they are.
R:  I -- I think so too, I think with --
L:  Probably have more time on their hands! [LAUGH]
R:  More than likely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think a lot of the women, they stick to -- I -- I don't think the women are as, um, nasty as the men are. [NOISE]  I think a lot of 'em stick to a cleaner fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, they -- they tend to bring families and stuff like that as -- where men just bring, generally --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the sex and [NOISE] vulgarity, most of the ones I've seen. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's true. [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE] I don't know what else we can say about comedy.
L:  I'm not sure either, it's kinda ...
R:  Yes, it's a tough topic.  Well, I -- uh, we used to go --
L:  I mean, it's not tough, it's just I don't know what else we're supposed to say.
R:  There's not a lot, yeah.  Well, we used to go to a comedy club every few weeks, and you know what, there are some that were just so funny and they were wholesome.  They -- you know, you just laughed because they were so honest but yet the way they presented it was funny.  And then you'd see some that -- you know what?  Although what they were saying was kinda true, the topic was just so inappropriate that you kinda just turned 'em off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I mean, I -- I like stand up comedy, I just think that some of them are so funny.  But you know what?  I found that the ones that I enjoyed the most were the ones that, you know what?  Although they were somewhat racy, they really weren't getting across the line and they weren't nasty to people, making fun of people and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  We've gotta be close to the ten minute mark.
L:  I know.
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't -- I didn't really look at the time when I called them 'cause I wasn't expecting that.
R:  Yeah, neither was I.
L:  Mm.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.  [NOISE]
L:  I wonder what this person is doing?  Why they're paying people to talk?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or supposed to be anyways.
R:  Yes.  [NOISE]  I'm not s- sure.  Maybe he's a comedian trying to think of how to change his act.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  I don't know.  [PAUSE]
R:  And another thing they don't really have is, um, they don't have a lotta comedians for kids.  Like --
L:  None I don't think.
R:  R- yeah, I've never seen [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some things for just kids.  Although I know here we have like, a radio station that does the kid joke thing.
L:  Oh.
R:  Which I think was good.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE] [MN] [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Oh God, I don't know what else to say about it.
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
R:  I mean, do you think most comedians nowadays cross the line?
L:  Not the ones I've heard! [LAUGH]  I ha- you know, I -- I mean they said, "How do you avoid it?" or something on the message, but I mean, you just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know --
R:  I think I'm --
L:  -- if you don't agree with something you just don't support that person.
R:  Right.  You don't go see them a second time or
