R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Richard.  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Hi, Richard.  My name's Heather.  I'm in Nova Scotia, Canada.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.
L:  Right off the coast.  [LAUGH]
R:  What's the topic, minimum wage?
L:  Min- -- do you feel that the in- -- minimum wage increase is sufficient?
R:  Uh, no, because I think, uh, minimum wage isn't livable because, uh, there was a time when I worked two minimum wage jobs and it was not -- even with two of them it was not a livable wage.  [LAUGH]  So, I think it should be a very realistic amount because not everybody who works minimum wage jobs are students or -- you know?  For me working has never been a hobby.  So, I've made a tough -- to make serious money and sometimes I've had to take minimum wage jobs and that -- in my view is not serious money.
L:  Oh ...
R:  It should be livable.
L:  I absolutely agree with you, um --
R:  But ...
L:  -- especially in this day and age where the cost of living --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- rises so quickly.
R:  Yes.
L:  I just [SIGH] ...  Minimum wage is -- is below poverty as far as I'm concerned.
R:  Oh, hey, I totally agree with you because, I mean, I'm fifty four and gone are the days when I was eighteen and I used to go to the gas station and ask for a gallon of gas with a quarter and get change.  Those days are all gone, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  And I -- I don't even fill my tank and twenty five dol- -- you know, twenty five dollars is gone without, you know, not even filling my tank.  So, everything is so expensive.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I know.  Unless you -- you go to, uh -- to secondhand stores --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you can't even buy a pair of pants for under seventy five dollars these days.
R:  I know.  And, um, I have some friends who are struggling and the second -- some secondhand stores are too expensive for them, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  And I --
L:  Yeah.  I just ...
R:  -- and I know I have friends who, uh, own their own business and, you know, say that minimum wage they -- they're doing their employees a favor, but you -- you can't -- you can't live on ...  Like in Washington minimum wage is seven dollars and one cent and everybody I know who's on minimum wage has two jobs and they're still struggling.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think, um, like in -- in certain places the seven dollars may go a lot further than it would be --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in -- in the city.
R:  Totally agree.
L:  So, they should probably have a sliding range.
R:  Yes, totally agree.
L:  I know the rural areas are -- it's much cheaper to live then --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- than in some places like Seattle, Washington, or New York City or --
R:  Yes.
L:  Delta.
R:  Yes.
L:  Minimum wage just -- just -- well, I -- I can't even comprehend.  Nova Scotia is a lot cheaper to live in than --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  U.S. and ...
R:  Oh, I wouldn't have guessed that.  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Because like the friends I know -- 'cause I have all kinds of, you know, fr- -- all kinds of social strata, have all kinds of friends, and the ones that are making minimum wage or even eight dollars, you know, they're still going to food banks and still getting as much outside additional help as they can.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  You know?  Just like even me my job is not minimum wage, but like I just left the dollar store because I needed socks and I'll be darned if I'm gonna pay, you know, eight dollars a pair [LAUGH] when I can spend a dollar.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Like I -- I -- my husband and I have it a little easier.  We can work whenever we wanna work.
R:  Good.
L:  Like he works for a golf course and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he gets minimum wage.
R:  Okay.
L:  But we're at that age -- we're in, you know, late forties, early fifties --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and we've gone and done -- got everything that we need to buy. We've -- we've paid for all our bills.
R:  Good.
L:  We've done the career and we've had the -- the, um, big paying jobs.
R:  Excellent.
L:  So, we can afford to go to the minimum paying jobs that are -- are low stress and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- spend time with the family and stuff.
R:  Cool.
L:  But kids that are growing up these days --
R:  I know.
L:  -- I mean, I just had a grand- -- my first grandchild was just born and my daughter she works minimum wage and I just don't know she's going to afford to -- to keep the boy.
R:  Right.  Right.  And, um, like I have a -- a couple of friends that are young and most of their money goes just to -- to basics, you know, rent, food, um, and they still hit the food banks and they're struggling.  Every day they say is a struggle and they're both working --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and they're young.  And you're right, you're -- I totally agree with you.  But there's a huger hole for them if they can't get some training and get -- you know, specialized training and get decent money 'cause they're gonna live like this their whole life and it's sad 'cause they're young.
L:  Exactly.  It just seems that like -- like -- like I'll go back to my -- people my age and -- and it was cheaper to live, therefore it was easier to get things even at minimum wage --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- when I was young.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, now we've gone through that, we've gotten all that, and now the kids these days -- things are so expensive --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and minimum wage doesn't seem to have moved very much.
R:  No.  No.  And like my -- going back to my friends it's like their -- their life is just one day after another filled with stress and then it -- we start being forced to cheat, you know, well, can we lie and get into this other food bank and get extra?
L:  Mm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yep.
R:  They're not talking about robbing a bank.  They're talking about living from day to day eating.
L:  Yeah.  And it doesn't -- like, it doesn't make them wanna go out and better themselves.  It's easier to go on welfare.
R:  You know, like -- and -- and it's interesting that you said that because I was talking to one of them yesterday and she said, you know, "I -- I think we could do better if -- if we split up and we went on welfare".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  'Cause she said, "We'd -- we'd have an easier life".
L:  Yep.
R:  'Cause I have a- another friend and she went on welfare just 'cause she -- I mean, she has a better house than I do --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and she's on welfare and she has a better car than I do 'cause she's on welfare and she has cheated and she's kinda scammed, but I can kinda see her point, you know?  She had had it with the minimum wage jobs and wondering how she was gonna feed her three kids --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and so she caved in and -- and the system is rewarding her and I'm not gonna -- you know, I'm not gonna judge her for one second.
L:  No.  No.  My son he went on welfare just recently.
R:  Yes.
L:  He was working, you know, doing the flipping burgers and this, that and the other thing and he just couldn't make it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, now he's got the government paying for his -- his rent.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  So, it's -- it seems -- minimum wage seems to put the kids in a home where then -- help them out.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.  And, uh, I think it's sad that minimum job does not reward people for working hard.
L:  No.
R:  You know?  And when I've worked minimum wage jobs it's like I'll be fair to you as my employer, but I'm not gonna kill myself --
L:  No.
R:  -- to -- to work a minimum wage job.
L:  And it seems that the minimum wage jobs you have to work harder than -- than the --
R:  I was just thinking that.
L:  -- white collar jobs.
R:  I was just thinking ...  And you're right.  I've had pretty decent jobs and I've had minimum wage jobs and the ones that pay minimum wage I've had to work harder, there's more stress.  It's like -- it's almost like my -- my work was never good enough --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and they always wanted more and I was thinking, you know ...?  The last time I worked a minimum wage job it was like four something and it's like I'll be darned if I'm gonna kill myself for four something an hour, or even seven dollars and one cent, I'm not gonna kill myself.
L:  No.
R:  I will be fair to you, but I'll be fair as -- as far as I think your seven dollars an hour goes.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  It doesn't give them any incentive.
R:  No.  And I think ...
L:  It's just like ...
R:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I was just gonna say like -- and like we have a Labor Ready here and those four people who stand in line at four in the morning when they get a job they're worked like animals.
L:  Yep.
R:  I've had, you know, a neighbor tell me he had to be breaking up concrete with -- with -- you know, not -- not electrical -- not electric equipment, just with, you know, um, some manual jack hammer, just with his strength, and it's like for a minimum wage all day in the hot sun are you nuts?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not worth it.
R:  And everybody I've talked to says that a minimum wage [LAUGH] job is harder --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- 'cause like I was a paralegal and I did not have the stress in a lawyer's office as a paralegal as I did with any of my -- my minimum wage jobs.
L:  No.  No.
R:  And -- you know, and I have a friend who says anybody can get a job that's true, probably anybody can get -- but you wanna job where you can survive --
L:  Exactly. 
R:  -- and I ...
L:  It's just -- it just seems --
