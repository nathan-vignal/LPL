R:  Hi, this is Sandy.
L:  Hi, this is Angie.
R:  Hello.  Um, so, what do ya think?  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's not sufficient at all.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  No.
R:  Why?
L:  I don't think a person can live on that.
R:  Well, I agree with that and -- and I guess that's where our -- our differences are 'cause like when they talk about minimum wage I don't think that it's not like in the fifties where they're talking like a living wage --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and if they're talking about like a kid that's gonna be working, you know, doing something then I think it's -- it's fine because if -- if they keep raising the minimum wage then like teenagers are gonna be the ones that suffer 'cause like jobs are gonna price themselves outta the market and they're not gonna, you know, be able to -- to do it.
L:  Well --
R:  So, like that for that reason I -- I think that the minimum wage is fine.
L:  -- for teens.  Yeah.
R:  Well -- well, for certain jobs.  I mean, I think the job is -- is becom- -- like, I mean, I -- I hire people all the time and -- and, you know, I'm hiring for a job not for a person and -- and like there's certain jobs that just, you know, aren't ...
L:  And what jobs do you hire for?
R:  Well, here like I work in a university, like secretarial or finance and ...
L:  And do any of 'em pay minimum wage?
R:  No, but they also all require a degree.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I mean ...  [LAUGH] You know what I mean?
L:  Right.  But my thing is ...
R:  But we have like people who clean out the rat cages and stuff and -- and, you know, we have people that like, uh, just do nothing but like empty out a trash can or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or work in the cafeterias and stuff and -- and their jobs aren't really like demanding and -- and a lot of 'em are young kids and, you know, it's -- it's just ...
L:  Well, let me just tell ya my background.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm a social worker and I have a degree.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I work with a lotta people who make minimum wage who come to me because they've broken the law because they can't pay their bills because they're adults and they make minimum wage and so I think, um, maybe that what your point is, which is an excellent point, that a teenager that lives at home their minimum wage level may be -- or should be actually different than someone who is raising children [LAUGH] --
R:  Well ...
L:  -- that they have had a tough life and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- couldn't get the degree and, you know?
R:  But, I mean, all right, so I'm just saying like the example of working at McDonalds and you're the person that's behind the register.
L:  Right.
R:  So, do you think that if a teenager were to have a job that they deserved they only should get the five fifteen, five twenty five, or if it's an adult then they should like nine fifty --
L:  Well, I ...
R:  -- for the same job? 
L:  But your point -- your point of pricing themselves out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the teenagers suffering 'cause the job's pricing themselves out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I agree with that, you know, and, you know, maybe there should be just like [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- maybe there should be, um, something like, you know, how waitresses make a different wage because tips are involved.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, maybe some other -- if you're -- if you can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's taxes, maybe a different level, you know?
R:  Right.  Like if you're a dependent then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then you can have a level?
L:  Right.  Um, but I definitely know that most -- I would say ninety nine percent of the population cannot work -- live on five fifteen an hour --
R:  Oh, oh ...
L:  -- unless they're working a hundred hours a week, you know?
R:  Right.  And I agree with that, but I -- I just, you know, look at it, um ...  But, like I -- I also don't think like people, um, like deserve a hand out.  Like I guess --
L:  No.
R:  -- what ir- irritates me is like when they keep bringing the bottom up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- like they're meeting the bottom, is meeting the middle class down the mid- -- and like so there's no incentive -- they'll be no incentive at some point for people to even, you know, uh, try to do better because why -- why go out there and bust your ass to make a -- you know, spend a ton of money on getting a degree and then having someone else who doesn't have --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a degree get the same job --
L:  Yeah, I agree with that.
R:  -- and make the same amount of money?
L:  I -- I -- I agree.  I -- I mean, there's -- there's no question.
R:  You know what I mean?  You obviously have a master's degree if you have a -- a social work degree.  So, it's like ...
L:  No, I don't have a -- a master's.  No.
R:  Oh, you don't?
L:  No.
R:  I thought they -- I thought you had for a social worker.
L:  No, I have a master's.  So ...
R:  That's what I mean.  Like if you have a mast- -- you have to have a master's degree for that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, like I work in a ...
L:  But guess what?  The pay is not -- you know, I mean, it's kinda like along the line of teachers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Social workers.
R:  I -- I mean, I work in a university.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I -- I'm the same ex- ...
L:  You -- you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  But, um, you know, still I work with -- I run a website, I teach people how to save money, how to make ends meet, I -- I deal with many people who cannot pay their bills because of the minimum wage standard --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, if they wanna keep the minimum wage the same then they need to find a way to lower the cost of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- gasoline and housing and [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, other things.
R:  Right.  Hey ...
L:  It's just -- I -- I think minimum wage should be the minimum a -- a -- a person could make to survive on the average --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the average cost of living.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  I -- I just -- I'm -- I'm -- I -- I get really upset --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- about the minimum wage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, this is a good topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Do you --
L:  Last topic was --
R:  -- you said you, um ...
L:  -- terrorism and I ...
R:  Oh, I did that one too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's ironic [inaudible] for, um, public health preparedness.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it was fun.
L:  Oh, I hated it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I didn't have a thing to say.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I thought oh, you know, what do ya do, but ...
R:  I just told him what like we were doing here at the university.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But said you run a website.
L:  Yes.
R:  Is that, um, Freelance dot com.
L:  Ye- yes --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- it's Freelance by You.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, that's me.
R:  I've seen your website.
L:  [LAUGH] Is that where you heard about this?
R:  Um, probably.
L:  Yeah.  So, yeah.  So, I'm Angie [LAUGH] and, um --
R:  Hi, I'm Sandy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Like I said, I -- I deal with people every day --
R:  Right.  Oh --
L:  -- that, um ...
R:  -- but, I mean, I guess 'cause like your daughter Kelly, I mean, like she -- she wouldn't be able to get a job if they keep raising the minimum wage up.  That's what I think is gonna hurt.  Like, I look at my niece and it's like, you know, she's gonna life guard for summer --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's like that's cool.  But, you know, and she's making five twenty five.
L:  Well, my daughter works for less than the minimum wage.  My daughter works right now for a dance studio for less than minimum wage.
R:  But not legally.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, actually she does it in trade --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, for her -- some dance classes.
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's -- it's legal, um, but it's not --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a pay check.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's less than minimum wage when you average it all out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm -- I'm cool with that, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because ...
R:  Oh, I mean, I used to baby sit.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I would do all that kinda stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I -- that's fine, but ...
L:  I'm cool with that for the people who are depending on other people to support 'em.  It's just the people who -- who cannot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- support themselves that are -- or are supported by others that I have an issue.
R:  Because, you know, like we had this issue come up in the university and you know what ended up happening is where they keep saying, "Oh, we need this living wage.  We need a living wage" and like well, that's all fine and good, but I can tell ya as a finance person what's gonna happen is we're paying two people now --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- to do the job at five twenty five an hour --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and if you raise the minimum wage too high we're gonna have one person doing the same job that both of you did.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, it's gonna affect unemployment then.  So, it's kinda like it -- it -- it just ...
L:  It's -- it's a vicious circle.
R:  Right.
L:  It is.
R:  And back in the day with living -- like a living wage in the fifties it was acceptable, like the min- -- it was one person, the man went out and worked, they only had one person.  But now it's like it's almost impossible for a family to live off of one income.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  You have to have two.
L:  Unless you are very creative, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know [several inaudible words].
R:  Well -- but, yeah -- but you -- you go through a lotta work to do it and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- there's a lotta people that won't go through it.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean -- and -- and I -- I get made fun of all the time 'cause I do the same thing and ...
L:  And that's great.
R:  It's fun.
L:  And -- and you're smiling at the end, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I mean, people are always laughing at me.  But then like when they find out they're like, "Oh, my God, you won a thousand dollars on I Won dot com.  Are you kidding me?" 
L:  Right.
R:  I'm like yeah, what did I do?  I clicked a bunch of clicks and that was it, you know?
L:  Right.  And if they see something you got like ...  Yeah, I have that all the time, you know?  Well, where did you get that?  How can you afford that?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, I work at it, you know?
R:  Right.  I mean, it's definitely an art.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, it's funny.
L:  But I -- I have -- like I said, I deal with so many people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so many women in particular --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- more so than men who haven't had the benefit that -- of even having a computer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to -- to save money or to make money or to win money and they have had poor parenting who cannot work for anything but minimum wage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and end up prostituting --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because they can't pay their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- feed their babies, you know?
R:  But I'd -- I'd rather -- rather than changing our -- our pay structure like -- if they -- I mean, if the government's gonna do this and step in like they should change it and like have a -- if they can -- an effective --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- type of welfare system like --
L:  Yeah.  Well ...  [LAUGH]
R:  -- something where you'll -- you'll be helping them, but not hurting ...
L:  Well, and -- and -- and again I have an issue with that because all of the welfare system is reactive --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not proactive --
R:  True.  Right.  That's true.
L:  -- and, you know, that's what I'm working personally towards is creating a proactive educational system for Social Services to teach people how to do what I do --
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  -- you know, and so that way they don't have to -- they can work for the minimum wage and still mystery shop and do the other things to make their life simpler.  But you gotta provide the computer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  So you get 'em to the -- you say, "Well, you've got free computers in the library you can use".
R:  Right.
L:  Well, they don't have a car.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  That's funny 'cause you know what though?  Like we -- we have computers.  We -- we -- we can't give 'em away at this point, like 'cause they're always updating our stuff, like I can't run off with any -- like I -- I run off websites all day and -- and H.T.M.L. and all.  So, I need like to update computers and we're giving away Pentiums and we can't even give 'em away.  So, it's like ...
L:  Give 'em to me.  I've got plenty of people I can give 'em to.  Plenty.
R:  The only thing is like I'm in Baltimore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like we're not like ...
L:  I'll pay your shipping.
R:  Okay.  Then you know what?
L:  I'm serious.  Contact me.
R:  Oh, I have your -- obviously I have your email.
L:  Yes.
R:  I'll -- I'll ...
L:  Contact me.  Please.  Because I have a plethora [LAUGH] of, uh, individuals who need computers that could --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- make their life a lot simpler, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I tried -- my Mom worked -- in fact, my Mom works at, um, the county gov- -- the county, um, library and I called her up and I was like, you know, we've got these computers that are better than the ones that are sitting in your library.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're Pentiums.  Do you want 'em?  And, you know, she went through all the circles and -- and it just was just too much red tape.  They just didn't -- and they're like oh, no, you know, you'll screw this up and they didn't -- they didn't want 'em --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I couldn't believe it.  It was like ...
L:  Trust me --
