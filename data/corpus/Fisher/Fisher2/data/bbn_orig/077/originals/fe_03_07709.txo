R:  [NOISE] Hello, this is Cathy.
L:  Hi, um, my name's Debbie.
R:  Hi, Debbie.  It almost sounds like we've talked before.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think it sounds familiar.  Um ...
L:  Yeah, same here.
R:  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I think you were the first person I talked to.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I'm sorry.  I'm still thinking about moving to Canada.  Is that what we talked about?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  No.
R:  Nope.  Okay.  Then it wasn't you.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Um, uh, did you wanna go first?
L:  Um, okay.  Sure.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I -- oh, what do I look for in a life partner?  Um, somebody that's decent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- honest, uh, reliable, doesn't lie, doesn't B.S.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, hmm, a sense of humor, uh, a good person.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I'm not quite sure exactly how to define a -- a good person, but definitely somebody that doesn't life, use or abuse and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  That sounds good.  I'm sorry.  My list wasn't as long as yours.  I was just thinking of honesty and, um, I just -- I -- I totally agree with everything else that you said.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think that's exactly right.
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  Is you want someone to be honest and kind and considerate.  Um, honesty kinda covers it though, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess.  If they're not honest then they're not gonna be honest in the relationship or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- or kind to you or anything else, so ...
L:  Exactly.
R:  I don't know.
L:  And certainly not in any aspect of it.  Jeeze!
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you -- just out of curiosity -- are you married?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I am.
R:  So ...  Yeah, 'cause I was -- I was gonna say well -- well, I'm sure you had those -- those things in mind when you got married.  Um, I was looking for someone who was spiritually, um, close to God too.  So, I think that was the big thing for me was just spir- -- his spirituality and would he make a good Dad.  I'm terrible.  [LAUGH]  I married late.  So --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- I kind of, um, was looking in a more practical sense.  Like would he -- would he be a good Dad?   Would he be kind to me?  Would he -- does he love the Lord?  Does he -- you know, does he -- he -- does -- do his values match my values?
L:  Yep.
R:  And, you know, I have old fashioned values.  I don't ...  I know it's not real popular these days, but [LAUGH] just kinda -- we're raising our kids kind of old fashioned and I'm glad -- I'm glad for the choice that I made with him because it seems -- it worked out good for -- for me.  I don't know.
L:  Good.  Good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I agree with that too.  Um, I -- I got married late too, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think, um, that we've been married -- we got married in ninety six.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like, uh, thirty two that's what I was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- I had, uh, always actually said I was never gonna get married [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is kinda funny, um, and I based that statement on my parents' relationship because --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- they had a really bad relationship --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, extremely abusive -- physical, mental and all the shebang --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and honesty didn't really play much of a part in it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that's why I'm absolutely adamant that I want somebody that's decent, um --
R:  That's decent.
L:  -- not gonna stab me in the back.
R:  I like that word that you used.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Um ...
R:  That's something that ...
L:  There's just no way in heck I wanted to go through what I saw my mother go through and I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no part of it [LAUGH], you look that way and I'm gonna run a hundred miles the opposite direction.
R:  That's it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember not going out on a second date if the guy looked like he'd beat me.  I was like [LAUGH] -- that was kind of a ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, I was -- I went out this one man and he said he liked me 'cause I looked so maternal.  I mean, that kinda [LAUGH] -- that was [inaudible] -- I mean, what can I say?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm like, "Well, thank you very much".  I'm like okay, I look I'd be a good, um, breed mare.  [LAUGH]  That sounds good.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, he -- he told me ...
L:  Um, next.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Next.  [LAUGH]  Right.
L:  Shoot!
R:  He had told me that his Dad beat him and I just thought, you know, there's some anger in his eyes and -- and some of the ways that he talks to me, even on a first date, trying to make a good impression he just seems a little rough around the edges and a little bit prone to violence.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I thought this would not be a good idea.
L:  No.
R:  I did not pursue that one.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  No.  I mean, it -- it can go either way with -- with kids that have -- that have been abused 'cause I -- I'm --
R:  It can.
L:  -- in that group, um ...
R:  Yeah.  My Dad was too.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I -- I -- I can -- I can -- I can be good.  I mean, like I try to be rational and -- and objective and that.  But, I mean, there -- there are times when if I get really ticked off --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like especially when I've been wronged and back stabbed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which unfortunately I have been by the rest of ...
R:  That hurts.
L:  Oh, yeah, big time, the rest of the bozos in my family.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I can -- I can get -- if I'm pushed I can get really bad whereas I can ...
R:  Everyone has that in them.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Absolutely.  But for the -- for the most part, um, you shouldn't act like that.  I mean, no matter what the heck you've been through --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, unless you're pushed to that extreme level, but that's --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- not always the case.
R:  No.  I -- I agree and it's like the defenses go out the window and it's like well, you know, okay, you asked for.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Here it comes!
L:  Exactly.
R:  'Cause -- and that's hard because that is from patterning from -- from being young and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's -- but you made a choice.  I really admire that.  That you made that choice not to be like that.  That's like my Dad did.  He was -- he was verbally and physically abused by his Dad --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and he at times was not very supportive and could be very hurtful with things that he said.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But he never physically abused us or -- or I could say actually verbally abused us 'cause we were children.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  So, he really -- he cracked up every now and then when we'd really do something bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But my sister and brother and I we were the only three kids.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, it was I'm sure we really were three times the trouble, uh, more than he ever asked for and we really pushed him and so maybe we thought it was kinda fun to do that.  [LAUGH]  We were really nasty kids.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um -- but, you know what?  I have to just really admire that in him that he just -- he really had a lotta restraint.  But we could tell 'cause he'd -- he'd like pucker his lips and like he'd stick his lips together real tight and -- and like you'd see air in his cheeks and we just knew he was --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- gonna explode and that's how --
L:  Oh oh.
R:  -- he held it in.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, just, uh, yeah, I know that feeling.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  But it's just -- yeah, I'm really grateful that he wasn't that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It sounds like you -- sounds like you did good too.  Do you have any kids?
L:  No.  No.
R:  Not yet?  No.
L:  We -- we met an active choice not to.
R:  Yeah.  I don't blame ya.  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  That kinda ...
L:  I -- I didn't, um -- I didn't want to for a number of reasons.  I didn't want to because my childhood was -- was absolutely horrid --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, because -- because of my Dad and my Mom was there protecting me, but she put up with a lot of crap to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to stay with him.
R:  That must've been awful.
L:  Oh, it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was absolutely awful.  Like, I'm still -- I'm still -- I'm going through like -- I'm -- I'm on, uh, I -- I guess the tail end of a depression kinda thing.
R:  Yeah.  That's leads me into it.
L:  Post traumatic stress, all that kind stuff and I'm ...
R:  Well, you don't have any control over what happened to you --
L:  No.
R:  -- and I think that leads to depression and the anger -- where is the outlet, you know?  You still were wronged and --
L:  Oh, big time.  Yeah. 
R:  -- there doesn't sound like there's an- -- been ever any outlet for that at all and --
L:  No.
R:  -- and, um, you know, you can't act out on your spouse, although I'm sure that's tempting at times.  But it's -- it's hard.
L:  Yep.
R:  It's hard.  I think ...
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  I'll pray that -- pray that he helps you grow and that and is supportive.  And he's a good guy, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  So, you're gonna be okay.  Oh, good.
L:  Yeah, he's very good.  Yeah, luckily I didn't fall into that pattern, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They say that you sort of, uh -- girls go with the father image and --
R:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he was extremely abusive and I --
R:  Oh, gosh!
L:  -- fortunately didn't go that route.
R:  Yeah.  I'm so glad.  Yeah.  'Cause then -- then they -- they bring the children into the world and it's just -- it goes right around again.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But, uh, most -- most of the people that I've met have gone the way that you are and the way my Dad d- did though --
L:  Good.
R:  -- and I think they need to -- you know, the media needs to do a report on those people 'cause I think they're heroes --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- that they can take that and turn it around and not be like that.  That takes a tremendous amount of inner strength to be different --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and to actively be different --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- 'cause most people don't realize what effort it takes --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and you have to -- you have to decide, where most people don't even have a clue.
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  Check.
R:  I have to be in the not have exactly a clue category.  So, I understand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Try to -- try to empathize, but I can't totally understand what you guys must've gone through.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I mean, I've -- I've -- I've had sort of, um, flash blacks of the way is I kinda describe it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I -- I was five and I was in -- I was at, uh, our kitchen table and eating a bowl of chicken noodle soup --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't remember what the heck happened, but he went off on a tangent and shoved my head in this big bowl of soup --
R:  Oh, how horrible.
L:  -- and I remember thinking oh, my God, I'm gonna drown in a bowl of soup.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  So, it -- it was --
R:  That must've been awful.
L:  -- not funny, not funny.
R:  Oh, that was awful.
L:  It was.  Yeah.
R:  How demeaning.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, big time.
R:  Yeah.  How demeaning.  That's terrible.
L:  Yeah.  Well, he can -- he can -- he can be really, really bad.  I mean like I'm -- I'm overweight and -- and his ...
R:  So, am I.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L: Well, his idea of helping me was, you know, "You're a big fat cow and you shouldn't eat that 'cause you're gonna turn out to be a bigger fat cow".
R:  Oh, that just really helps.
L:  Oh, yeah, that helps!  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Oh, gosh, you poor thing.
L:  Yep.
R:  That -- that was hard.
L:  Which -- which is -- which is why I kinda go, you know -- well, I definitely know I do not want any of this nonsense --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I want, like I said, a decent person, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Did you -- when you were young you were overweight did you by any chance -- did you have your thyroid checked?  'Cause I ended up having thyroid disease after I got over two hundred pounds and they finally caught it.
L:  I did ...
R:  So, on a personal note I -- I wanna help you that way 'cause I -- if you need to have that checked get it checked 'cause I was hypothyroid and it caused me to gain weight even though I wasn't even eating a lot --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and chicken noodle soup isn't fattening if that's what like what you ate --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- a lot when you were going up.  That's not gonna, you know, make you fat.  So, it's ...
L:  No.  Um, I think I did have that checked.  I did have that checked a few years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then I believe somewhere prior to that and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't think that it was a problem, but ...
R:  Well, keep -- keep on 'em on though because I know a lotta people who are borderline that they just don't wanna medicate, but it helps when they get medication 'cause it's just a hormone that you take.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Easy.  Easy, easy stuff to take and, um, it helped me so much.  Yeah.  It doesn't help me lose weight, but at least I have energy again --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- and, um, it does -- it does cause depression if you're low also.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, that can aggravate that too.  So, I'm just learning all this stuff about this lovely disease.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Really.
R:  But I'm really trying hard to help anyone that I know that -- you know, that I meet that it might h- have a problem, um, with the thyroid gland 'cause it's not your fault, then there's a lot of, you know ...?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's so nice to talk to you.  I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, that's okay.
R:  Debbie, I'm sorry.  This is just like one of those things where we won't get to talk again.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um -- but, um, I'll be praying for you and your husband that -- that things go well and that --
L:  Oh, thank you.
R:  -- you know, the Lord watches out for you and helps to heal that anger 'cause he can actually heal that better than anybody and, um -- I just -- I know religion is really hard to accept when you've had a bad Dad because father imagines stink [LAUGH] and --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- I mean, that is really a hard thing to change in life.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  'Cause when people say father you go yeah, right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, pretty much.
R:  Father in heaven, who wants it?  And ...
L:  That's pretty much exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I know.  It's hard.  But, um -- but you can -- he -- he can help 'cause he's helped me heal other things in my life and I was a --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- came to the Lord like thirty three years.  So, I was old.  I mean, I was much older than a lotta people are when they raised in it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I wasn't raised in it and I tried everything else.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  I think that ...
R:  But it just didn't -- didn't help like that did.
L:  I think that's a better --
