R:  Hi, there, my name is Shelley. 
L:  Um, hi, I'm Calvin from, uh, Los Angeles.  Where are you from, Shelley?
R:  I'm in Seattle.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] is it raining up there?
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] Yes, it is.
L:  Oh, well --
R:  It was just --
L:  -- [SIGH] we could be in New York or something, because we don't have any sun down here, so --
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  [SIGH] Well, acceptable [MN].
R:  [MN]
L:  I didn't see Dumb and Dumber.  Did you? [SIGH]
R:  Um, no.  
L:  The new version?
R:  Oh, no, I haven't seen that.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] actually, I think it's a [MN] takeoff on that Jim Carrey one, you know, and --
R:  I haven't seen that one either [SIGH].
L:  Oh, uh, neither did I, but, uh, they say there were a lot of flatulent jokes [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, uh, things of that sort, which I guess kids sort of like.  But, uh, uh, I don't know [MN].
R:  I still have a kid sense of humor though.  I can't help it.  I -- I do laugh at stuff like that, that I [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, people buy whoopee cushions [LAUGH] all the time, so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I dunno [MN].
R:  Um, I --
L:  Do you get out to the movies very much?
R:  [SIGH] I try not to actually.  I don't like the crowds, [LAUGH] um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, yeah, that's a good thing.  I'm actually watching a [SIGH] television program -- I guess it's Foul Play, which, uh, Goldie Hawn --
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that's an old one, yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's an old.  It's in San Francisco, which is my home town --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, uh, [SIGH] I really like San Francisco, but we -- as I say, it's really strange down here.  We're having Seattle weather.  We had drizzle and [SIGH] I think there's some rain, um.  But what was the -- Sleepless in Seattle or what -- what was the movie?
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.  I have not seen that movie.
L:  Well, that was pretty good [MN] --
R:  Was it?
L:  -- that was comedy romance, so that -- that's innocuous, but, uh [SIGH] --
R:  I don't like romantic comedies --
L:  No? [LAUGH]
R:  -- personally, no [LAUGH].
L:  Well, they say there's a new one out, um, which is a remake of an earlier one.  I can't remember what it is, but, uh, um, [LIPSMACK] they said it wasn't very good, it wasn't very funny and there was no chemistry between the people, [MN] so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't know why they made it, but, uh [SIGH] --
R:  I don't know.  I [LIPSMACK] -- see I -- I am getting older, but I still laugh at really imm- immature things.  I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I like South Park and things like that, and --
L:  Oh, yeah, that -- that's good.  Actually, there's a lot of, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't have cable, but my godson, who is twelve, has cable, so I see all these, um, shows.  Uh, there's one with, uh, [LIPSMACK] Anton Krishna, uh, where they do practical jokes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Is that Crank Yankers?
L:  Um --
R:  There's that one and there's another --
L:  Punked Out -- Punked Out.
R:  Okay.  [SIGH] There's so many --
L:  Uh -- yeah, I think that started a trend --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and the one I saw, and I thought it was quite funny, is they [SIGH] went up to Justin Timberlake's house and they pretended to repossess his house.
R:  [MN]
L:  They had all sorts of agents, you know?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In uniforms, and they had, [SIGH] um, boxes where they -- which were empty, of course, but it was like they were moving furniture and they said he owed seven hundred and forty seven [SIGH] thousand --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- dollars [LAUGH].  And then the punch line is Punked Out, so -- I guess you can do it when you know the people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  And not get punched, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he started crying, actually.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, but I guess there's a lot of stuff like that on cable.  As I say, I don't --
R:  I don't have a TV.  I -- I go to friends' houses to --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- watch these things.  Um --
L:  That's good.  You know, I [MN] -- the things I miss are sometimes they have some of these, uh, public television things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which are pretty good, you know?
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, and I would like the bible channel and the arts and entertainment channel, I guess, but --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- I don't really watch that -- I watch television, but I'm talking to you, [SIGH] and I usually read while I'm watching television, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- put on the, uh, the, um, captions, you know?  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Which, uh, you know, I guess we don't have too much time [MN].
R:  [LAUGH] No.  Um, [SIGH] well, uh, you know, some things on South Park that they get away with, um, are -- are kind of outrageous, but it still makes me laugh, so --
L:  Well, who -- who do I like?  Um, [LIPSMACK] which is pretty interesting, um, Spongebob Squarepants, do you ever watch him?
R:  No.  I've seen the little dolls, but I've never seen the --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- the program.
L:  -- um, it's actually fairly adult humor, you know?  Y- y- -- there's nothing, um, you know, nobody really gets hurt or anything, but [SIGH] there are some insights in that.  And it's pretty popular with adults, I understand.
R:  Hmm.
L:  Uh, because they make, uh, we sell Spongebob cakes -- I work in a Baskin Robbins, and [MN], uh, people get 'em for the, uh, [LIPSMACK] adults besides the kids --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?  And they have the little Spongebob Squarepants and [SIGH] -- same thing with the Hulk.  I haven't -- I don't go to movies very much now because they're quite expensive [MN] actually.
R:  But they are, I know.
L:  You know?  And I prefer to, if I can, go to, uh, well, [LIPSMACK] sometimes you get free movies.  In -- in Los Angeles it's very good, because [SIGH] if you get the [SIGH] papers, like the LA Weekly and I think there's probably a Seattle Weekly, [MN] down here they -- they wanna test market the movies.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, um, if you go to a certain store, if you go to Boaters or if you go to Tower Records or something, [SIGH] and you're there early enough, they give you free passes for two people.
R:  [SIGH] We have -- I don't think it's a test, [LIPSMACK] um, screening.  I don't -- I don't know -- we have that, um, sometimes, and they give away free passes [SIGH].
L:  Yeah, well, a lotta times in -- in other cities, they -- I guess they, um, try to get word of mouth, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, [SIGH] and, um, down here they'll -- they actually do, and sometimes they, uh, [SIGH] make you fill out forms and [LAUGH] you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Tell 'em what you liked and didn't like and so forth.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, it's kind of hard for comedy.  I don't really know what makes people laugh, though.  I -- I kind of like the, uh [SIGH] -- the last comedy thing I saw was Hugh Grant, uh, Only a Boy, I think.
R:  I don't know that one.
L:  Uh, which was very good because it, uh -- he was, uh, [LIPSMACK] um -- well, he -- he was wealthy, because his father wrote a jingle [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so he didn't have to work.  All he had to do was spend the money, you know, off the jingle?
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH] But he wanted to meet, um, [SIGH] women, so he pretended to be a single parent, and then you can meet all these other single parent women.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Uh, so, technically it was a -- a good scheme, but [SIGH] he got involved with this woman who had a boy who had problems.  And he began to bond [LIPSMACK] with, uh, the boy along with the woman, of course.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And what was good is that, uh, he changed him, uh, so he didn't become so -- quite so deceitful and deceptive and he started to understand other people's problems.  And [SIGH] I thought that was a -- a very good comedy, you know?  Uh --
R:  Yeah, there are a couple like that that I've seen --
L:  Um --
R:  -- one of them was with Tom Hanks, I can't remember the --
L:  Yeah, the --
R:  -- Big -- Big Daddy, that was a --
L:  Oh, yeah, that kind of thing.  And, you know, th- that -- it's true there's so many single parents around.  My -- my godson, uh, [SIGH] who's twelve, he's, um, [LIPSMACK] his mom raises him because his dad died, and his dad was my best friend --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- from England.  Um, [LIPSMACK] so that makes it hard, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think, you know, people get separated earlier these days, and [SIGH] you -- you know, in a Baskin Robbins, you find, uh, [MN] the, um, parent taking the kids and maybe that's the only time they see the kid and they, you know, in the week.  Every other week, they, uh, [SIGH] have an outing with them and they go to movies and stuff, and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Well, you know the -- the older stuff, like Bill Cosby and stuff like that?  Um, in his early [SIGH] years?
L:  Oh, yeah, uh, he -- he watches that too on Nickel- -- I don't know that that's on Nickelodeon, but [SIGH] -- yeah, and they talk about jazz and -- and, uh, he's a great jazz player, but --
R:  I didn't know.  But he's -- uh, see, I like him, because he can [SIGH] make you laugh without being profane, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] The old stuff.
L:  Well, there is a lot of really filthy comedy out there, which I guess they -- they wanna make you laugh, uh, by shocking you.
R:  Mhm, yeah [MN].
L:  Uh, [LIPSMACK] and, uh, it's sad, because the kids get into that, and they think it's, you know, appropriate but, uh --
R:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  
L:  Yeah.  In fact, one of the things that is sad about the Iraqi war is that I understand that the [SIGH] Americans don't have much [SIGH] common sense over there.  The soldiers, they're ju- -- some of them are young kids and they use the F word all the time, and, uh, [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's a different, uh, you know, in America --
