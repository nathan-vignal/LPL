L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Debbie.
R:  Uh, I'm Sarah Woods from Oregon.
L:  I'm Debbie from Michigan.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you, Debbie.
L:  Yes.  You too.
R:  How many times have you done this before?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I think this is my fourth time.
R:  [NOISE] This is my third time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  How did you hear about it?
R:  And it's kinda interesting.  Online.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I actually, uh -- I think -- I think that, uh, I was sent an advertisement through my email --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for it.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Me too, online [LAUGH], that's how I learn about everything.
R:  Could I ask you a question really quick?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  Um, have you actually gotten paid for doing any of this?
L:  No, not yet.
R:  I was sort of -- yeah, I was sort of wondering if they do it after you've, um, done it ten times --
L:  I think --
R:  -- or what.
L:  -- I think it's -- is it five tim- -- five calls that you take?
R:  I'm not sure.
L:  I thought ...
R:  I thought it was ten.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, may- -- you know, I don't know.  [NOISE]  Maybe there's different plans or something.  But I don't know -- or if you call them plans or whatever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I know that, um ...  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  An unruly two year old.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, I -- I think that I signed up for five calls.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, I thought that's what they were.  [NOISE]
R:  So, they must pay at the end of it or something.
L:  Yeah.  Close to it.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So, what do you think about the minimum wage increase?
R:  I actually didn't know about it.
L:  Me either.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've been outta the workforce for so long that it doesn't matter to me.
R:  Um, well, it, uh -- I -- actually I just don't know how anybody even makes it on that in the first place because, um ...
L:  Well, if you're supported by your parents, you know, most ...
R:  If what?
L:  If you're supported by your parents, you know, most kids -- I mean, when I was in high school I was making, you know, minimum wage, but you live at your parents' house, you don't have bills --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that.  I guess that's ...
R:  I suppose, um, if I had to say yes or no to it I'd say that I would approve of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I probably approve of something more than just, um, for it to go up like -- it went up like fifty cents or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I, um -- I think I would -- I would approve of something a little more than what we just got --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I know that we've owned a couple of businesses and I know sometimes they say that, um, it's -- it's more than just someone making, uh, a little more than an hour, but it also affects the businesses and so, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but as a -- as a business owner I think I would still approve of another one.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [NOISE]  I guess so.  I haven't -- I -- I have four kids.  So, I've been outta the workforce for [LAUGH] quite some time, um ...
R:  I have five kids.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have girls, boys -- a mixture?
R:  Two boys and three girls --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- and they range in age from ten to one year.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  But I don't work either.  Well, I do --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- um, sort of.
L:  Yep.
R:  I stay at home with them, but I also do other things.  I have a [inaudible] and I -- I'm authoring a couple of children's books.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  But my husband actually works outside the home.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  I do other things at home too, but I just -- I can't say that I don't work.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  As you know with five kids you do work.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You definitely can't say that you don't work.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And my husband does work out of the home too.  So ...
R:  Now, what is the minimum, uh, wage in Michigan for the statewide minimum wage?
L:  I don't know actually.
R:  You don't know.
L:  I ...
R:  I -- I know that here in Oregon it's actually above the national minimum wage.
L:  Oh, I think when I was working it was five [NOISE] -- oh, I wanna say like five fifty three or some, you know, odd -- it was an odd number.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think five fifty three or five twenty three and then, um ...
R:  In Oregon I think it's six twenty five.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  And every time the national minimum wage goes up our Oregon minimum wage also goes up, um, because they try to stay above --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it by so many cents.
L:  Now, you guys, what percent tax do you have?
R:  Oh, boy.  Um, I think we're about the thirty one percent tax bracket.
L:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I mean, um, like your state tax on goods.
R:  Oh, oh, we don't have one.
L:  Oh, you don't?  [MN]
R:  No, we don't.
L:  I was gonna say, okay, you and Montana, and I think that's all that doesn't have a tax, is that right?
R:  Yeah, I think you're right.
L:  Yeah.  We're actually ...
R:  I think you're right.  I think that it is just us -- us and Montana.
L:  Yeah.  We're actually headed out to Montana tomorrow.  [LIPSMACK]  My parents live out there.
R:  We used to live in Montana.  We just moved back from Montana.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, where did you move -- where did you live?
R:  Great Falls.
L:  Oh, I have relatives that live in Great Falls.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.  Oh.
R:  I liked it, but I didn't really -- I liked the people there.  They're very, very nice people.  [NOISE]  But it was really flat --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not very many trees.
L:  Even in Great Falls.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I grew up in Bowsman.
R:  Oh.
L:  In Bowsman, you know, Bridger Mountain Range.  It's, uh ...
R:  And it's beautiful on the other side of the lake, but on -- or on the other side of the mountains, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- over here in Great Falls it's kinda of, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's sorta plain and I definitely like, um, the -- there's not as much wind here --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Great Falls is really windy.
R:  -- and -- and extreme temperatures --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- aren't near what they were in Montana.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was just awful.
L:  Now, Oregon gets quite a bit of rain, is that right?
R:  We do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But we def- -- but we have definite seasons here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we have four seasons and in Montana there's really only two seasons -- cold and hot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going out -- my, uh -- my -- I have grandparents and parents and aunts and uncles and all that that live up there and usually my husband drives us out and then the girls and I will stay out there for a month and then he flies back and he'll drive us back.
R:  Oh, how neat.
L:  So, it works out good.
R:  Yeah.  I know ...
L:  That way we get to do all the family reunions and all that.
R:  Oh, neat.
L:  So, it makes ...
R:  And, uh, how's the weather in Missouri right now?
L:  Uh, we're in Michigan.
R:  That's where you're at, right?  Oh, Michigan I mean.
L:  Michigan.  Mhm.  It's really good.  W- we're actually supposed to -- or, you know, we have four seasons also.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's a lot like Montana, but it's, um -- we live right by the lake.  We're like five miles from Lake Michigan.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Um, so, it's -- it's really damp --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so trying to adjust, you know, when it's cold it's like frigid cold because of the dampness in the air.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  And in the summer it's really humid, um, you know, once we hit -- excuse me -- past, um, July first is when it starts getting really hot and humid.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I'll miss all that.  Darn!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, you're gonna Montana, you'll be there for a little while and then instead of having the, um, moisture --
L:  Now, I'll just have the hat -- hat.
R:  -- you'll just have the really grueling --
L:  Dry heat.
R:  -- hot.
L:  Yep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Actually where my parents are at they're -- they're not in the mountains, but they're in a -- in a bridger range or in the basin type.  It's in Bowsman, between Belgrade and Bowsman.
R:  Which city are they in?
L:  I'm sorry.
R:  They're in Bowsman then?
L:  Mhm.  And --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so they get -- I mean, it's hot, but it -- I don't know.  I guess the dry heat is so much different than a moist heat.
R:  Yeah, that's ...
L:  So ...
R:  Have you been up near Polson or, uh, Kalispell?
L:  Mhm.  Actually my ...
R:  I absolutely love it up in there.
L:  Yeah.  If -- actually if we were to move back, if my husband and I and the kids were ever to move we would move near White Fish.
R:  Yeah.
L:  White Fish or Kalispell, that area.
R:  It's absolutely beautiful up in there.
L:  Yep.  And it's by the lakes, which we're used to the lakes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, now, what made you move to Great Falls?
R:  Uh, my husband's job.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  He works for a big company and, uh, they transferred him over there and then, uh, we transferred back a year later --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then we switched jobs, staying in the same industry, but just sort of moving up the ladder a little bit --
L:  Right.
R:  -- up to, um, Northern, uh, Oregon instead of Southern Oregon.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, he's actually moved three times the last, uh, twelve years with his job.
L:  Oh, wow!  Wow!  And with kids.  I don't think I could move.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  You have ...
R:  -- it has been hard definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's been worth it.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's ...
R:  It's definitely been worth it.
L:  That's ...
R:  Each move is, you know, a little -- little step up and the -- the kids have enjoyed that part of it.  They have a little more room, a little bigger house and stuff like that than --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they had a few years ago.  So ...
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Um [LIPSMACK], um, shoot.  Sorry.  I thought I was gonna ask you something too.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ...
R:  How long does it take you to get from where you're at over to Montana?  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, twenty six hours.
R:  Wow!
L:  It's a long drive.
R:  That's I guess about what it -- that's about what it took though to -- for us to get, uh, from Oregon to Montana.  Although I -- I think it was a little bit less than that.  I think it was more like twenty to twenty one hours.  But it was a very long drive.
L:  Oh.  Now, Oregon, Washington -- oh, Idaho, Oregon, is that right?
