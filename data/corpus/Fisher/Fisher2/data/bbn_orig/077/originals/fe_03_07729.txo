L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Marnie.
R:  Who?
L:  Marnie.
R:  Pat.  I'm Pat.
L:  Okay.
R:  How are you?
L:  Okay.  How are you doing?
R:  Fine.  I didn't quite hear what the discussion was supposed to be about though.
L:  Um, we're supposed to talk that if the minimum -- minimum wage of five dollars and fifteen cents an hour is enough.
R:  Oh, that's what she said?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  I got it.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  Okay.  I heard that and I didn't know, you know -- I was listening to -- I was trying to turn the T.V. down at the same time.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, do you want me to begin or would you ...?
R:  Yeah.  You go ahead.  You begin.
L:  [NOISE] Um, I don't feel that it is enough, at least in the area where I live.  I feel that it needs to at least be maybe six dollars an hour --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then even that might not be enough, but at least it would be more than what they get now.  Now, right now I don't work, but the job I used to have I did get more than minimum wage and ...
R:  You did or did not?
L:  I did get more --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my husband was working too and that was just -- I mean, we lived comfortably --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- while I did that.  But, I mean, at five fifteen I really don't know how people are living even if they don't have children.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  My son and his, um, girlfriend -- or his wife I should say, they just got married -- they both just make like ten dollars an hour --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they live in Iowa and that happens to be enough for them to live on, but not save a lot.  So, I don't know how ...
L:  Yeah.  See, that was our same problem.  I mean, we could live week to week, but we didn't have much put back.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  They are, um ...  I don't know how anybody, any family, any person can live on five fifteen.
L:  Yeah, even just one person.
R:  No.  One person ...
L:  I mean -- 'cause if you put in, you know, whether, you know, you're paying a mortgage or rent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- you know, and then just even every weekly bills, just to eat and things and to keep your life going.
R:  Luckily my husband has a very good job.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Luckily.  And he's, um -- well, I'm a -- a little older I guess -- because, uh, he's been there thirty years --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- at the same place.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, and that's -- that's -- that's good.  My son has a fairly pay- -- you know, ten dollars an hour is not -- it's ...
L:  No, that's pretty good pay.
R:  It -- it -- it is and -- and the jobs here, uh -- when he started here before he moved to Iowa they, um, started at -- I think he started at eight.  Yeah, he started at eight dollars an hour.  So, five fifteen to me just is [LAUGH] simply not enough.
L:  [LAUGH] Either it is to me.  I mean, I have an L.P.N. license and around here we begin like at twelve to fifteen dollars --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- an hour.
R:  Really?
L:  [LAUGH] So, I mean, how people live on five fifteen an hour --
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.
L:  -- [LAUGH] I have no idea.
R:  I don't either.
L:  I mean --
R:  You know?  It -- it ...
L:  -- it just --
R:  It just ...
L:  -- seems a little unbelievable.
R:  Oh, that is unbelievable.
L:  I mean, I -- I do know of a few people who work at minimum wage jobs, but they do it more just for extra money.
R:  Yes.
L:  They usually have a spouse or somebody --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- who -- who has the main job, you know, that pays for a lotta the things and theirs is just more extra money, like at Christmas time or --
R:  That ...
L:  -- or to go on vacation or stuff like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Or buy a new T.V. or a new car.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That kinda stuff.
L:  That -- that I can understand.  [LAUGH]
R:  That I could understand too.
L:  I mean, you know, but to actually have to live on it from week to week.
R:  No, I don't -- I don't -- no, because, um, we happen to have a little -- we've lived here for twenty seven -- twenty -- twenty nine -- twenty eight years and I don't know how anybody could live with five fifteen and even pay their, uh, house payment like we pay.  I don't know.
L:  I -- I mean --
R:  It's crazy.
L:  -- I've been in my -- the area I am with my husband now for ten years --
R:  Ten years.
L:  -- and where I grew up ...
R:  Do you care tell -- do you -- do you care to tell what state you're in?
L:  I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in North Dakota.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  And, I mean, here in Pennsylvania it's not real, real high living.  But still at five fifteen --
R:  Neither in North Dakota.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] I mean, it's not like we're in California or -- I mean, those places really are outrageous.
R:  Yeah, North Dakota's very low -- low key too.  I happen to live in Fargo, which is the biggest city in North Dakota.
L:  I was gonna say I'm -- I'm in Altuna.  It's sort of a smaller town.  I mean, it's not even considered one of the larger towns of Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ...
R:  I've never been to Pennsylvania.  We've been in thirty eight states.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  You're really not missing much here in Pennsylvania.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's nice being here at certain times of the year, but other than that there's not a lot to -- I mean, we're not real touristy either or anything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I mean, in that rate you really don't need a lotta money --
R:  No, we don't either, you know?
L:  -- to -- to survive on.  So ...
R:  But coming back to five fifteen even -- you couldn't live here for that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I don't -- and I'm pretty sure you can't -- I know you can't in Pennsylvania.  That's, you know ...?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, it's ...
R:  I don't think there's any place you can.
L:  Well, I'd hate to go to some places and have to try and live on it.  I mean, like New York or --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I have a friend and --
L:  -- or some of them places.  I mean, you'd just -- you wouldn't make it.
R:  -- she -- I have a friend that lives just outta the city of Washington D.C. and it -- I think she said a small apartment, efficiency, was over a thousand dollars a month.
L:  Yeah.  That's what -- my husband had a friend years ago that lived up in New York --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he couldn't live right in New York.  He had to live like out in Rhode Island and drive in every morning because he couldn't afford the rent on even just a small apartment for himself --
R:  And he was making ...
L:  -- let alone paying for anything else.
R:  And now things are so much worse than they used to be.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everything is way -- you know?  Uh, what I don't understand is things keep going up.  Our gas jumps around like a yoyo.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gas around here is astronomical for this area.  I mean, we were used to like sixty, seventy cents a gallon --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and now we're up to like a buck fifteen, a buck twenty a gallon.
R:  That's cheap for us.  We're ...
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's cheap for other places.
R:  Yes.
L:  But around here people complain 'cause we were just used to so cheap.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  No.  I understand that.  I understand that perfectly.  Well, we pay like a dollar -- we're up to a dollar forty two and then just last week it was up over a dollar fifty.  Now it's down to one thirty nine.
L:  Yeah, I know, and then they expect, you know -- 'cause some people to travel to work.  I mean, I know I used to before I got married.  I -- I traveled sometimes half an hour, forty five minutes just to get to a job and, I mean, I didn't get -- for the jobs I didn't get any money for that.  I mean, that was out of our own pocket.
R:  [MN]
L:  And I don't know how some people, you know, can afford to even travel in their car to their job [LAUGH] --
R:  The -- the question ...
L:  -- especially at minimum wage.
R:  At minimum wage they can't.
L:  I mean, you -- half your paycheck would go just in your car.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  And with your -- with gas prices jumping around like crazy, you know?
L:  I mean ...
R:  I guess five fifteen wouldn't even last a weekend for some of the --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- places you have to drive to.  Five fifteen an hour times forty -- if you work forty --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you work forty.
L:  And usually I don't think at five fifteen an hour you're working forty hours a week.
R:  I don't either.
L:  Usually -- I -- my guess would be around twenty if that.
R:  There you go.
L:  That might even be a little high.  [LAUGH]
R:  That twenty might even a little high because I know a lot of the college kids here -- well, this is the tri state, uh, college area up here.  We have three big colleges and they don't take ...
L:  Yeah.  We have a college close by too.
R:  We have -- well, Minnesota's the -- Market, Minnesota, is right across the border.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're right -- right across the river.
L:  You're real close.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  We're real close.  We're six miles from the river and that's the border and so there's three col- -- big colleges and they don't take minimum paying jobs.
L:  All right.
R:  Or if they do they take the, um -- what should I say? -- the better ones like in, uh, restaurants where they get good tips.
L:  Yeah.  You'd have to.  I mean, you have to have something to make up for the low wage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just to live.
R:  And if you -- if you -- if you ever go to fast food, which we don't a lot, you found a lot of, like you said, the older people working there that are just, uh, doing it for something to do or a little extra.
L:  Yeah, I know.  We do go -- we go to fast foods 'cause we have three children and I'm ...
R:  Three children?
L:  Yeah.  And, um ...
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  I have one and he's married.  So, we have none at home.
L:  [LAUGH] No, all three of mine are here.  They're like seven, five and one's just turning a year old next week.
R:  Oh, my!
L:  So, we frequent the fast foods and there really aren't a lot of o- older people that work even during the day.
R:  Yep.
L:  I mean, they're all more younger and ...
R:  Because, I mean ...
L:  'Cause you can't live on that.
R:  No, you can't.
L:  And quite frankly how you have to work in them places it's not worth it for five fifteen.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, if they actually want people who are going to work I think they need to up the wage.  [LAUGH]
R:  You're right.  Absolutely.
L:  I mean -- or -- or at least if they want competent help 'cause a lotta the younger people don't care.
R:  This is also what my husband always says.  They don't care.
L:  Well ...
R:  You still there?  Are you gone?  [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] You there?
R:  Yep.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  You still there?  I'm still here.
