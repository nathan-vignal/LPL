R:  Hi, Yuka.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi!
R:  Um, do you know what the topic is?
L:  Um --
R:  I could not un- understand what they were saying about the topic.
L:  She said, um, where do you draw the line with acceptable humor, um --
R:  Oh, acceptable humor.
L:  Yeah, and like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- what do you think is in bad taste?  So --
R:  Oh, in bad taste.  I could not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make out -- I'm on my cellphone.
L:  Yeah, it's really hard to hear.  Me too.  It's -- it's kinda hard to hear but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um [LAUGH] -- should I start talking about it first?
R:  What?
L:  Should I like, start saying something about it first?
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  I guess --
R:  What's your -- what's your thoughts?
L:  Okay, um, I think that I -- I'm pretty -- like, I like to think I'm pretty humorous, I don't get really too offended with like, most humor these days but it -- it is getting like, a little out of control these days I think.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, [LAUGH] it's --
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I like -- I -- I mean, I like good humor.  I like it if it's funny.  I -- if it gets a little too sarcastic or disrespectful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of either, you know, women or men or ...
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, races or something, I don't care for that, I don't like that all, you know, I don't -- I don't appreciate that kind of humor 'cause to me that's just not funny, you know?
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  Um --
L:  -- just stupid.
R:  But I -- I do like -- I -- I'm k- -- I kind of run on the corny side, I like corny humor, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, just kinda making -- making fun of like, a certain word or, you know, using it in a different context or something.
L:  Right, right.  And I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, I guess that I would think that, um, I don't really find it too offensive, it's like, someone talking about like, culture maybe.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But like, uh, racist stuff like, I don't know, like lately even if I wa- -- do you watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, The Comedy Channel or anything?
R:  I don't, I don't, so I don't have a lot of exposure to like, comu- commercial comedy --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, like --
L:  Like --
R:  -- comedy for ...
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  'Cause I was in New York and like, all the comedy clubs here, it's like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can't go in without hearing like, racist comments and -- like, even --
R:  See that's --
L:  -- if the person's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, even if the person's like, making fun of their own race.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, the -- it's kinda funny but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at the same time it's like, it's like I was just shocked, like, can't people think -- like, think of regular funny things anymore?  Like, not like, insulting people, you know, like --
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm -- that's what I'm thinking too.  It's like, you know, I don't -- I d- -- I guess I don't think that there is that -- is really all that funny, you know?
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  So, I --
L:  It gets old.
R:  And I know that a few of the things I've seen, um, uh, not -- I don't know, I don't think it must have been on The Comedy Channel but some of the funny, you know, people are laughing or something at some of the stuff on TV and I'm kind like, well I don't, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not all that funny to me, so ...  But, um --
L:  Do you think that, um, like, did you ever see, um, [LIPSMACK] J- the Jackass movie or anything like that?
R:  No, I did not.  I -- I --
L:  Oh, well, h- -- are you familiar with that show at all?
R:  Um, no.  I -- I saw commercials for it or, uh, maybe a preview or something on a different movie that I watched.
L:  Yeah, that's -- I don't know, like, I don't find that funny either really [LAUGH] like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're kind of like injuring themselves and --
R:  Oh, is that where they're -- they're d- -- oh yes, do really stupid daring things --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and find it funny.  Yeah, I don't think that's funny either. [LAUGH]
L:  Like, all my friends think it's funny and like, I could see how it -- it could be like, interesting but it's not something where you would like, laugh out loud.
R:  Yeah, or --
L:  [inaudible] you know.
R:  -- or like, plan to watch it, thinking, "Oh, this is gonna be really good" --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you know?  I -- I would just be kinda like avoid it probably.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But I tend to think like, yeah, I kinda go with like, stupid humor like, maybe like Austin Powers or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't -- I've -- I have not seen a ton of his stuff, [inaudible] stuff sometimes I don't -- I don't care for but, um, I'm trying to think of -- of ... like, some of, um ... like, some of like, Billy Crystal's cleaner stuff, you know, or Robin Williams cleaner stuff.  I don't --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  I don't get into a lot of profanity or, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- se- -- or too highly sexually overtoned [several inaudible words].
L:  Right, right.
R:  But like, some of that -- or -- or some of the later Steve Martin stuff, you know, I like that kind of stuff but I don't -- I don't go for -- if they're gonna be cussing every other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- word or, you know, talking about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sex overtly --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and stuff, I just don't get -- I, uh, you know, I just don't find that funny, it gets kinda old and ...
L:  I'm wondering like, maybe if it's like -- like, uh, male female thing?
R:  It could be.  I think guys like stupid humor more than girls.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you even seen like, [inaudible] in the Moonlight?  Have you ever --
L:  No, no.
R:  -- seen that movie?
L:  No.
R:  That's really -- I found that to be ridiculously stupid, but like, my husband and my son thought it was just hysterically funny.
L:  Really?  Well, yeah --
R:  So, you know --
L:  I just -- I just [inaudible] --
R:  -- it might be that, you know, women like different types of humor than men.  Well, you know --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- they were doing just dumb stuff.
L:  Yeah, I know men seem to think like, a lot of things are funnier like, I think women have more like, specific taste in like, what they think is funny and what they think is just stupid.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think -- I think it takes a lot of talent to be funny all the time too, you know?  And I just don't think there is that much --
L:  Well, I think Jim Carrey's funny.
R:  What?
L:  I think Jim Carrey is funny.
R:  Yeah, he's had some funny stuff.
L:  But he's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- getting kinda like -- uh, his is more like funny like, if you were just listening to him on the radio it wouldn't be that funny.  But because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're like, watching him and he does all this crazy stuff with his facial features and everything.
R:  Facial features, yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I find that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- find that funny like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely find that funny.
R:  Yeah, sometimes it does, it -- it -- you have to see the person that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- talking.  So --
L:  [LAUGH] I mean, can I ask you like, do you know what exactly this is for like, this phone call thing?
R:  Oh, their research?
L:  Yeah, like --
R:  Yeah, I -- it's a research study.  Um, I think it's about linguistics, you know, just the way different people talk and --
L:  Oh right, okay.
R:  -- and that type of thing.  They're doing studies for, um -- like, I know when I filled it out I had to put it down where I was born and -- and that kind of stuff, and so I think they're trying to study different --
L:  I feel like --
R:  -- the way different peoples talk.
L:  I don't r- --
R:  You know.
L:  Yeah, I don't really remember like, when I filled it out, so -- I think I did put where I'm from and everything.
R:  Yeah, they asked me where I was born and, um, [LIPSMACK] how old I was and that kinda thing, and so I'm thinking they must be studying people's voices.  My brother told me about it and -- and he thinks --
L:  Oh right.
R:  -- they have something to do with the government wanting to map people's voices to --
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he thought.
L:  Do you think it is?
R:  I don't know.  I don't know.  It seemed to be like, kind of a interesting study though and, um, I just thought it would be kinda cool to participate in it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, and [MN] you get paid ten dollars for each phone call, right?
R:  Yeah, I know, that's -- yeah, that's even simple enough.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, it's -- I was wondering like --
R:  -- this is only my second call.
L:  Oh, w- what was your first one?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, my first one was about a week and a half ago I think.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, what was it about? [PAUSE]  Reality TV, that's what it was.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  And, um, so we talked about reality TV and it was really funny 'cause I'm from Michigan and I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ended up on a call from a gal who was also in Michigan.
L:  Really?
R:  Just a different part of the state.  Yeah, that was pretty unusual I thought.
L:  That is pretty unusual.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just unusual that like, so many people know about this that they can like, give you a partner for each time you make the call.
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  'Cause --
R:  -- almost spontaneously I think.  You know, they just keep --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- trying until they can connect.  Like, today I connected with you really fast, and last time --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- um, it took just a couple of minute I think [inaudible] till they found somebody. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it took me like -- like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   -- a couple of seconds I would say.
R:  Yeah.  So it's kind of interesting, you know, you get to just chat with people you don't know and -- and --
L:  It's kind of awkward --
R:  -- you know.
L:  -- 'cause, like, you really don't know the person at all, but it's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's kinda fun.
R:  [LAUGH] It is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It is, it's kinda interesting.
L:  I really do wonder like, are they using it -- are they using it for like, good or evil, you know?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  Like, I mean, I -- I guess it could be just for, um, like, advertising or something, right?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Like --
R:  It could be, yeah.  You wonder what the purpose is, but my husband -- or not my husband -- my, um, my brother really thought it had something to do that -- with the military.  Because if you look up their, um, [LIPSMACK] at that website, it did kinda have that flavor, you know, of, um --
L:  Oh like ... really scientific, like, top secret.
R:  -- gover- -- it was a governmental kind of -- i- it was -- I think it was a dot gov, G.O.V. website that you went to, which would be a government site.
L:  Oh, r- really?
R:  So, um --
L:  Really?
R:  -- it might have something to do with defence or, um, you know -- everybody talks on -- on wireless phones and stuff now and I -- maybe they have a way to track that or something and they're trying to figure out, you know, how they'd be able to tell who -- who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somebody was or something like that, I don't know.
L:  Maybe, yeah, maybe.
R:  'Cause they're --
L:  Or
