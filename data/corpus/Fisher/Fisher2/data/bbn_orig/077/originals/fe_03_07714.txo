L:  [NOISE] Hi --
R:  Hi --
L:  -- my name is Tony.
R:  Hi, my name is Dulcie.
L:  Hi, how are you doing?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  Oh, just fine.
R:  Cool.  [NOISE]
L:  So, the topic is life partner, huh?
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Should be a very interesting topic.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, um, well, um [NOISE] I don't where shall I start? [SIGH]
R:  Well, I guess they were saying, um, what you -- what things you look for in a partner?
L:  [SIGH] Well, for myself, um, it wasn't necessarily a, um -- it wasn't even a physical thing for me.  I mean, it was just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] It was more of an intuition, I guess.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause actually I -- I had met my wife nine years ago and my wife and I used to do reenactments eighteen century.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And I just happened to go one year and I just happened to see her --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing her, uh, bit, a- she was doing a gypsy.  Uh, for the reenactment and it was just -- something just clicked.  I mean --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'd never even talked to her before.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, the guy that I was with, you know, I just made the comment that, you know, "One of these days, you know, I'm gonna be with her".  He kind of like, "Yeah, sure, whatever".  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I mean it wasn't even that, you know -- that I had met her or even talked to her.  Um, it was just [LIPSMACK] -- just a gut feeling really.
R:  Right, right.  Yeah, I share that sentiment.  I, um, got married in August.  We'll actually be two -- two years so, um, I met my husband about eight years ago.  He was in the military and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we [SIGH] -- I -- I think when we first met, I was really looking for just more like a friendship, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with someone that I could kinda go out to the movies or go dancing or whatever.  And just h- kinda have fun.  Um, and so he really -- a- again like you were saying.  [LAUGH] I kinda have to echo what you said because I really kinda had an intuition that he was probably the one that I really wanted to be with.  And, um, you know, a few years passed and a lot of things happened in between that time --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but we still -- we were really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- comfortable with each --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- other so I -- I was looking for someone that really, um, accepted my kids because they were teenagers at the time we were dating.  Um, someone that like I said I could just go out and have fun with that kind of understood me.  And it was not -- [MN] it -- I didn't want it to -- to be a relationship so to speak but just friends.
L:  Right, just a -- just a, um [LIPSMACK] -- a platonic relationship [NOISE] pretty much sounds like what you were looking for at first.  [NOISE]
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it just developed into something else.
R:  Right, so --
L:  Well, that's good then.
R:  Yeah, it -- I mean -- I mean it was really -- it's worked out really well.  Like I said, our two year anniversary will be in August so it's -- it's been [MN] a journey because [LAUGH] he was in a [inaudible] and now he's going in the navy but there were so many qualities that he had that I really, um -- things that I was looking for in him because I -- my father had passed a few years before and -- and I had a really wonderful image of my father so I was looking for a lot of things, um, in the relationship.  Even though I wanted to be friends, I was still [LAUGH] like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- maybe -- maybe this is [NOISE] what I'm looking for.  [NOISE] Maybe I'll -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I'll be able to, you know, go out and do things with this person or what have you but, um, I- I think it's hard some times because you don't know [NOISE] in a relationship what you're really looking for.  I -- I think you can -- I think it can really be, um [NOISE] -- it can be difficult.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Well, I mean -- it c- it can -- it's really difficult for a single mother too.
R:  Right, exact- --
L:  Because a lot of guys don't wanna get into a relationship with someone that already has children.
R:  Right, exact- --
L:  Um, I mean, I'm fortunate, you know -- actually, I wouldn't even say fortunately but -- but my wife she never -- she didn't have children.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, we've been married five years and we now have two kids. 
R:  Mhm [MN].
L:  And, you know, I -- I know a lot of guys that have dated women and when th- when they found out that they had children they blew 'em off.
R:  Right, absolute- --
L:  And I'd say, "Wait a minute.  Come on".  
R:  Right, ab- --
L:  Y- you know, "Be realistic here".
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, "Sh- you're already past all the expensive part".  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, exactly, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's -- it -- and -- and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- with my husband, he had a lot of good qualities, um, that I looked for.  One was he was really good with kids.  I -- I didn't know that from the beginning and, you know -- and kind of being around him more, um, for the first year, I -- I just said, "Oh, you know".  He [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- he has nice qualities and then sitting down with his mom and she would, you know -- she would, um, kind of talk about the kids that in the neighborhood that came to see him to play with him.  And he's also been teaching so he -- he just has a lot of -- a lot of good qualities and it is hard, like you say, when you're a single parent, it is hard.  A lot of the people that you, um, meet or whatever, they -- they're not willing to go further than saying, "Okay, well that person has children, I'm not gonna even try to --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- to get past that".  And he was [inaudible] --
L:  And it -- and it -- it's a true shame because th- you know, there's -- there's a lot of good single parents that need a partner --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to make it easier for them.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I mean, you know, it -- had I known that she had children, it -- it would not have changed my mind a bit.
R:  Right, right, and you're looking for the certain qualities in that person.  And -- and once -- sometimes even it works to the point where you may say I -- I -- you know, you're mind is closed.  "I don't wanna get involved with someone that has kids".  And then as you get further on and [MN] down the line and you get attached to them.  And you see what quality they have or qualities that they have and you really, you know, willing to -- to stay in that relationship and that -- that's what happened with us so it -- it -- it ...  
L:  Yeah, I mean, th- the biggest, um, advantage for a guy having -- being a single father or single parent is that women are drawn --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- towards kids, generally speaking.
R:  Right, right
L:  Um, but it's the total opposite for women.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And that's just -- doesn't make a darn bit of sense to me.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, you know, you can have just a -- a good relationship with someone that has children already then someone that doesn't.
R:  Yeah, there's so many -- there's so many qualities, um, things that you look for in a mate and you know like you said at the beginning of the conversation, you just know when -- when that person is right for you.  Um, and -- and that's trial and error.  Like [LAUGH] a lot of other things in life, it's trial and error.
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, but [MN] it -- it [LIPSMACK] -- it [SIGH] -- I'm just thinking on different relationships that I [LAUGH] had and the qualities that I look for in a mate and -- and, you know, at the beginning of a relationship, I was feeling, "No, they don't have these qualities" and I would know, nine out of ten.  Um, a- you know, and then just this one, my marriage here is -- was just totally different from my first, um, marriage when I was eighteen.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  So, there's so many different things to look for.
L:  Well, I -- I -- I think that the easiest way to find someone is to not look.
R:  Right, right.  [inaudible]
L:  Um, because my wife, she was in a relationship with, uh, another guy for several years and he broke it off and just left so she was single for two years and then we got together and, [NOISE] you know, it was just something that, uh, you know, she talked to me about a lot of personal things and -- and I talked to her.  And this was, you know, really only a -- shortly after we started seeing each other.
R:  Right.
L:  And it just, you know, blossomed from there and -- and became -- well, you know, she's truly my best friend.
R:  Mhm.  That's --
L:  Uh, and -- and I couldn't ask for a better friend than she is.
R:  Right.  I think that's really -- that's really one important thing to look for in a relationship.  Um, whether you're -- you're marriage or -- you have to be friends and, you know, to say someone is your best friend, y- that -- that's really -- that's a true statement.  Um, because I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I feel that same way about my husband.  Um, that was one of the qualities and -- and there were just so many other qualities that, you know, patience and understanding and -- and so many different things when I would be late, you know, doing something with my kids and we were going to a movie or what have you so I -- I really -- those things I had a little list --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a little mental check list and I just thought of, "Okay that [MN] he has this quality, [LAUGH] that one". 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and then I -- I went from --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- there so, um, that -- that is important.  I think that it's really important.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it sounds like you -- you found somebody that really understands --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- uh, how your life changes after you have children.
R:  Right, right, because he --
L:  Uh, because, you know, my wife, uh, our son is three and our daughter is nine months.
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  And she's been n- -- she's nursed the both of them.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, like -- she just can't up and pack off at seven oclock and I can come home at midnight.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, or e- -- or even in the middle of the afternoon for four or five hours.
R:  Right, right.  [MN] That's -- that's neat.  Um ...
L:  So, it -- it's -- it's really stressful on her at times.
R:  Right, right.  And -- and y- you know, when you say you're her best friend, those are all things or qualities that you have to -- y- you know, you look at her and you appreciate all those things would -- before you were dating, you know, and you're thinking about, you know, y- you made the right decision.  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the things that -- or the qualities that people have that you look for in a relationship is so -- [MN] there just is [MN] too many to even count.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but ...
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's not necessarily even one thing.  It's just a -- a -- a overall combination and, um, just, like I said for me, it was just a gut feeling.
R:  Right.
L:  And the more I got to know her, the more I know that I was right about that.
R:  [PAUSE]
L:  A- --
