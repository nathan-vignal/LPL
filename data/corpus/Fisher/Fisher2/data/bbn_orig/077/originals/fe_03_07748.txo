L:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, my name is Linda Steve, I live in Florida.
R:  Hi, my name's Judy, I live in Iowa.
L:  Hi, we're talking about minimum wage?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay, this is my first call.  Um, [LIPSMACK] it's five fifteen an hour, I think it's horrible and ridiculous, um, it doesn't make any sense because of the cost of living has gone up more than fifteen cents, um, do you have any feedback?
R:  Yeah, I agree with you.  And, yeah, I don't even remember what minimum wage when I started working.  I don't even remember what it used to be.  I don't think it was enough then either.  [LIPSMACK] But I agree, it, um, probably needs to be l- at least, I don't know how much -- much more than fifteen cents more.  At least twenty five cents more than that probably.
L:  I -- I think it should be five seventy five.  A gallon of milk is almost three dollars, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  A tank of gas is a dollar fifty, depending on where you get it from as long as you buy the cheapest gas.  Um, a pound of hamburger is three dollars and twenty nine cents, depending on the grade of hamburger that you buy.  You're not even making enough an hour to buy a gallon of milk.
R:  Food.  Yeah, I agree, exactly. [COUGH]
L:  It seems that your mortgage goes up, your rent goes up, your electricity bill gets an increase, telephone company gets an increase, but the minimum wages, it -- it -- it --
R:  Stays the same.
L:  -- it stays the same or it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doesn't climb very fast at all.
R:  Exactly.  And how is anybody supposed to accomplish anything when they're always going backwards.
L:  I don't know if we're going backwards but we're definitely going slow --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- forward at a very slow pace.
R:  That's tr- -- that's true, yeah, that's correct.
L:  Um, minimum wage for waitressing is two thirteen an hour.  Agreed, they do make their tips.  Um, but when it comes to working, if they think for some reason that they're not doing the same task that a person that makes minimum wage is, they're completely -- I mean, they're out of line, they -- it's not true.
R:  Yeah, I know, yeah.  I agree.  I, um, I waitress and, uh, it's a lotta work.
L:  I wish that the lower class and the middle class could, um, have some kind of an input on the minimum wage, uh, some kind of input on, um, uh, the loaf of bread or child support enforcement, or, um, the -- the standards of getting a g- government home opposed to ... the minimum wage.  It's -- it should all could be combined.
R:  Right.  Exactly. [COUGH]  I think, um, I don't know, I think the pe- uh, I think the people who make the decisions don't know --
L:  I don't think they've ever worked for minimum wage to begin with! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly, they've never -- they don't even know what that's like, how would --
L:  No.
R:  -- they know what's it's --
L:  No.  They've been blessed and they're fortunate and they have no idea what minimum --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wage would mean for them and their lifestyle.
R:  Exactly.  If they had to live like that for a day they'd never make it.
L:  Actually, I'm surprised it's five fifteen, I thought it was five thirty five.
R:  Oh, no.  I don't think it's gone up a- again.  They talk about it but then they don't do it.
L:  Hm.
R:  And I c- -- I can't remember how long it took but the last time they increased it even to five fifteen, I think it took 'em a while.
L:  What did they say it was?  Five twenty five?
R:  Five fifteen.
L:  Five fifteen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] That's -- that's ridiculous.
R:  It's -- yeah, it's crazy.
L:  And --
R:  And then even if a, um, even if someone wants to start someone above minimum wage they don't have to start 'em on that much more.
L:  No, but they've --
R:  You know what I mean?  If --
L:  -- they sure got a big in- -- a bigger incentive than five fifteen an hour if they did --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- start 'em higher than minimum wage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They'd probably get a lot more out of them.
R:  Right.  Well, some jobs you -- you -- most jobs that you get for five fifteen an hour you work a lot harder than -- it's worse to come to work for five fifteen an hour.
L:  Mm, and probably you pay three seventy five an hour for a babysitting, so you've got, what, [LAUGH] you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a little over two dollars left an hour.
R:  Shh.
L:  That -- that -- that makes no sense.
R:  Wow.  Is that what it is?
L:  Well --
R:  Hm, that's amazing.
L:  It's almost --
R:  Yeah, I think e- when I was younger and I was babysitting I made -- I could make five or six an hour just babysitting.
L:  Well, minimum wage is five fifteen an hour and if you drop your child off at a daycare, that's fifty dollars a day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're not gonna make that in an eight hour shift.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, that they're -- it's a shame that they don't let us vote on it.
R:  Yeah, that would be a very good thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I hadn't thought of that.
L:  Or at least pay us minimum wage to go down to the Child Enforcement Office --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and let us collect the money!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] I'll be ya we do a better job than they do.
R:  That's right, exactly.
L:  And they'll only have to pay us minimum wage.
R:  M- yeah, yeah.  What harm would that do in it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Mm, they'd never give us, uh, give anybody that, that's for sure.
L:  No.  I'll pay five -- somebody five fifteen an hour to, um, undo what all the, um, uh, [LIPSMACK] AFDC or CDS workers do and, um, put -- put us in their place because right now they've probably haven't been in our place, so --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  They're --
R:  Mm, never --
L:  They're more out to -- they're more out to get work -- better work from somebody that they pay, um, six or seven dollars an hour than five fifteen, that's just, you know, you're asking an awful lot.
R:  Yeah.  There's no way for someone to [inaudible].
L:  You know, minimum wage --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you're gonna get a minimum, um --
R:  Yeah, that --
L:  -- sort of, uh --
R:  -- you get what you paid for.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  You get what you pay for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I go -- it -- people just like anything else.
L:  Dedication's only gonna go so far.
R:  That's right! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I -- if they can't even fill a tank to get to work, how are they gonna, you know, what -- what point is there in you having 'em there?  'Cause they can't put money -- couldn't pay -- can't pay the gas to put the gas in the car to come to work.
L:  They should, um, take everything into consideration before they rule on a minimum wage like that, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're not being realistic. [SIGH]
R:  No.  And e- by the time that they say, "Oh, we've had a living increase" we've had our, you know, the living increase has, you know, that it's probably gone up three times --
L:  Well, I don't --
R:  By the time they say, "Oh, there's one".
L:  What I don't understand, I believe the Post Office gets a, um, a -- an increase in their pay twice a year because of cost of living.
R:  Yeah, I think that's it.
L:  But then, when -- I wish I knew the last time minimum wage was raised and I almost, I don't think it was once a year, I don't think it's once a year.
R:  No, no, no.
L:  So --
R:  I think it's been at least a couple of years.
L:  Oh.
R:  At least.  From what I remember.  'Cause they don't know.
L:  Gosh, how m- --
R:  I don't know.
L:  How many minutes of --
R:  I don't remember --
L:  How many minutes have gone by?
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Aren't they supposed to come into -- isn't it funny how long ten minutes seems when you have to ...
L:  When you don't know what you're doing.
R:  -- talk -- yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when you have to talk and talk and talk, yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  Hm.
L:  Sometimes it'd be better to know who you're talking about so you can give your honest opinion about this minimum wage stuff.
R:  Right.  No, no, it's crazy.  I -- and I -- I see people go through it all the time.
L:  Oh yes.
R:  People come -- employees have come to me saying, you know, you know, I nee- -- I'm -- I'm paying them more than that and, um, they still need more.  You know, like, some people in parts of the country you can't get by on more than -- on less than --
L:  No.
R:  -- seven or eight an hour --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and you're supposed to get by on five fifteen?
L:  No, it doesn't.  unfortunately it doesn't work that way, they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're keeping the middle class and the lower class right where --
R:  Where --
L:  -- they're at and they're not gonna --
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  -- they're -- they're not gonna give 'em --
R:  Right where they want 'em.
L:  They're not gonna give 'em a boost up and n- especially not by minimum wage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh my lord, five fifteen an hour, that's a joke.
R:  It'll be five years before it gets up to six dollars.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Probably.  Because they won't --
L:  I don't know about that but [SIGH] I don't know.  It seems like I was a kid making five dollars an hour and I'm definitely not a kid anymore.
R:  Yeah, you know.  I don't remember what it was when I was making it but it doesn't seem like it was much less than that.  As I recall.  It seems like it's gone down but maybe I'm wrong about that.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  Um ...
R:  Hum --
L:  Oh gosh, I'm running out of things to say.
R:  But that's -- it's -- you know, it's even harder when you agree, you know what I mean?  'Cause you can't even ...
L:  When you agree?
R:  When you agree on something, you know, it's not -- it -- you know, there's not as much to say.
L:  No, there's not.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Um, I think it's appalling.  I think -- I wish our congressmen and our, you -- you know, our president, oh for that matter how I wish our County Commissioner --
R:  Would do --
L:  Would -- would have --
R:  -- do more about it.
L:  -- worked -- would've -- well, no --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- I wish they'd live on minimum wage for a year.
R:  And see what it's like.
L:  Um, six months, they couldn't last a year actually.
R:  Yeah, no.
L:  They'd be blowed out.
R:  I'm not sure they'd give it six months.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, they'd be blowed out.  It's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they'd be -- they'd be selling drugs on the street corner.
R:  Yeah.
L:  "I can't make it on five fifteen an hour".
R:  Exactly.  I don't know why this doesn't come up being discussed every year.  I don't know why ...
L:  I mean, they say --
R:  -- somebody has to --
L:  They say that --
R:  -- I don't know --
L:  -- we have a voice when we vote but [MN] not really.
R:  We don't, no.
L:  Not -- not as much as we should.
R:  Only on what they say we can have a vote --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a voice on.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  And that doesn't count.
L:  I think if we had a voice -- did she say our time was up?  [PAUSE]  Hello?
R:  I don't know.  Are you still there?
L:  Yeah.  Did she say --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- our time was up?
R:  I didn't hear anything.
L:  Okay.  I think if we had a voice on the minimum wage I think it'd be a lot higher.  I don't think we'd -- I do- don't think we'd go astronomical and ask for something that we didn't deserve but I don't think we'd work for peanuts anymore either.
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  No.
R:  'Cause most people I know don't think are surprised to find out that it's low.  Most people don't think it's that low.
L:  I really didn't, I thought it was five thirty five.  That really, really amazes me.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Five fifteen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My Lord.  I just hope it's -- it's a better
