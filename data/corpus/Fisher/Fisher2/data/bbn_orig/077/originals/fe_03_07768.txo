L:  Hey, I'm Robert.
R:  Um, I'm Anna.
L:  Hi, Anna.
R:  This is the first time I've gotten one of these calls.  I was kind of intrigued -- what's it about?  Just -- y- --
L:  Um -- I'm not exactly sure --
R:  -- you talk about it?
L:  -- I -- I believe they're doing, uh, linguistic studies.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, for, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- computer recog- recognition and stuff like that. 
R:  Okay.
L:  It's the University of Pennsylvania doing it.  Uh, this is my second one.  They actual- -- we got -- we got connected very quickly here, so that was good.
R:  And we're supposed to talk about minimum wage?  
L:  Well, the topic of the day is, uh, min- minimum wage, do you think the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- five twenty five minimal wage -- I guess it was just increased to five twenty five -- is sufficient.
R:  Absolutely not [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, that's -- uh, my -- I would say probably it is, because, um, number one is, uh, you know, the -- the living wage argument's a fallacy to begin with.  It's just not really compatible in economic, a true capitalist economic system.  And most people who earn a living -- or work on the minimum wage do so as a transit type, uh, job onto a more productive, uh, employment later down the road.
R:  [NOISE] Well, you also have to take into account that many people on minimum wage also have to, um, accept welfare [SIGH] and when they do accept welfare and are on minimum wage it makes it very difficult to get out of that cycle.
L:  Sure, yeah.
R:  It doesn't -- [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I agree.  [SIGH] But also, too, you know, once you're in, um -- you know, you can use welfare there as a -- you know, a form of conduit to identify who these people are, maybe work with them [SIGH], and that way you separate the people who are just, you know, kids working after school than people actually trying to support a family.
R:  [NOISE] That would be me [LAUGH] [NOISE].
L:  Uh, so any time you start jacking with minimum wage it hurts small business.  And that's something I -- I've got a lot of experience with.  You know, I just, you know, you just, uh, there's always two sides to any argument.  And, uh, I mean, you -- you can jack minimum wage to ten bucks an hour, fifteen bucks an hour [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE] Well, but that would --
L:  -- all it's gonna do is --
R:  -- just increase inflation and make cost of living go up.
L:  Well, yeah, it would.  I mean, [MN] the minimum wage, that's a solution to the -- to the probably people who are -- are truly, you know, under skilled in society and unable to [SIGH] -- to, um, develop or generate sufficient income.  
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I just, um, I -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- it's great -- great for politicians, it makes good PR on the -- on the radio, but in an economic cycle doesn't really do any good.  And many -- and many times it dries up, you know, the very same jobs they're trying to quote enhance, uh, because, you know, people [SIGH], especially a small manufacturer, uh, you just jack the minimum wage to seven bucks an hour, I'm -- I'm gonna move over here" or, "I'm going somewhere else" --
R:  [NOISE] Exactly.
L:  -- or worse, "I'm just gonna go offshore".
R:  Exactly.
L:  [MN]
R:  And, well, not only does it make it di- -- it makes it more difficult for employers, too, because then they have to [SIGH] increase the cost and it -- it's --
L:  True.
R:  -- all about supply and demand, basically.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Jack- -- jacking up minimum wage, making -- making it higher than it already is just makes everything else cost more.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't get those --
R:  That's basically --
L:  -- cheap tacos any more [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, definitely not [LAUGH].  No, I'm in -- I'm in that actual situation myself.  I -- I receive --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- just above minimum wage trying to support a family as a single mother.
L:  Really? 
R:  And I'm on welfare, and I can't get out of it [SIGH], so ...
L:  Well, you gotta -- you gotta increase your skill sets out there [MN] --
R:  Well, I -- I -- I have skills.  I do wanna go back to school though.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  But, anyway, so [MN] ...
L:  Just gotta really be marketable.  I'm -- I'm an IT guy, and actually, I'm laid off right now, but, uh, you know, I make a really good income.  So, I'm -- I'm pretty, uh, pretty comfortable financially right now.  I also got -- taking off going to Singapore, uh, five days through next month, and, uh, just taking a little trip.  But, um, I tell you, you know, um, like IT's a good example.  Now is kind of a dead time, and, uh -- but it's also a good time to go ahead and build your skill sets up because it's coming back.
R:  It -- it really is.
L:  And, um, I mean, it's, um, it's not a bad field to get into.
R:  We've -- we've kinda reached a -- a low in the technology advancement.  I think it's about [MN] time someone starts coming out with new stuff.  And I figure they will pretty soon.
L:  Oh, yeah, I mean --
R:  I know that we've accomplished so -- accomplished so much in the past several years.
L:  Yeah, I mean, if you're, like, in a situation like you're in, you just gotta get out there and -- and just keep, uh, you know, remarketing yourself.  You gotta constantly, um -- you know, my dad went off to college in -- in the nineteen forties and, uh, got out of college and [SIGH], you know, "Well, you know, I got my degree, this is what I'm gonna do" but -- and then -- then did it.  But in my field, I mean, it's so freaking dynamic and really now many, many of the better jobs in the whole economy are becoming so dynamic in how they change, you've gotta constantly be on this treadmill of constantly improving yourself and relearning and updating your skill sets.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I think that you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- also have to take into account the, [NOISE] uh, type of -- type of, uh, I don't know, way that the families are raised nowadays.  It's changed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- quite a bit.  [SIGH] Now you find both parents in the work market; they don't give their kids a lot of [SIGH] attention.  They end up not going to college, which means you have more [SIGH], um, out of high school people and, like, early twenties people who are still stuck in minimum wage positions.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because they don't have those skills.
L:  Well, yeah, I -- I guess I was pretty fortunate.  Of course, I was on the, uh, the twelve year plan to get my four year degree, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Oh, well --
L:  I did eventually get it, but, uh, and actually my dad actually cut me off and, uh, I guess my last two years, um, I actually was at one time working for three jobs.
R:  Oh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that must have been fun.
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Putting a lot of time in, I mean, basically one full time job and two other smaller part time jobs, but, um --
R:  [NOISE] I was basically one of those young stupid teenagers who dropped out of college, got pregnant young and now my husband's in prison and I'm alone [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no [LAUGH].  So, you here in the Dallas area, or ...?
R:  No, actually I'm out in, uh, Saint Louis area. Saint Louis -- 
L:  Okay, well ...
R:  -- Missouri.
L:  I had a, uh, person [inaudible] Dallas with a guy yesterday who actually lives in Dallas, and, uh, I got to talking with him and, uh, it's pretty funny.  He's actually in IT too, but, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, actually, I was -- I used to work for SBC, so I used to --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- do a lot with the, uh, with the, uh, people up in Saint Louis up there.
R:  I could -- I could -- I could definitely see myself getting into that.  It's -- I don't know, it's difficult with my daughter, trying to find time around --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to -- around her schedule.
L:  Well, the best thing to do is, you know, first of all, is begin to learn the subject.  And I -- I tell people if they're really interested in doing this and starting at ground zero, [SIGH] number one, start jerking around with computers.  Build one.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And lot of the smaller mom and pop computer stores, least out here in Texas, they have a -- a build your own session.  [SIGH] Where, if you go there --
R:  Oh, do they? [NOISE]
L:  -- and buy all the components, um, they will have a class on a Saturday that'll teach you how to build it up.  But learn -- learn --
R:  That's crazy.  I'm -- I'm less hardware, more software oriented.
L:  Yeah, well, then they'll --
R:  I mean, I -- I could write my own programs and stuff, but I've just never gone to school for it or anything.
L:  Yeah, yeah [inaudible] and there's actually quite a few colleges now have, uh, non degree programs you can go through that are very structured, very focused and usually about seven months to one year duration, where you can go into this program and learn this particular skill set in, um, a fairly intensive environment.  Usually go about two times per week, and then get certified and come out employable at the other end.  But, something to think about.  Everything's all about timing in this business too, and so, you know --
R:  Oh, definitely, absolutely.
L:  -- you -- this is a really good time to begin building your skill set back up, because we're gonna be in a whole different market here, hopefully, um, eight months to a year out.  And so they'll be looking for people, and there probably some opportunities coming up.  You know, people at entry level.  It's all for -- you know, that's the second step. Once you get to certification, you got the old catch twenty -- twenty two, "Well, they want experience", well --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, can't get experience unless you give me this job.  Then usually the up market, the up cycle, uh, is the best time for entry level to come in then, when they're looking around for people and they, you know, going back to third or fourth person they like, they end up taking a different offer.  So, they come back round to you and give you the shot.  And I got real lucky when I got my break in IT, I, um, I just really waltzed into, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what was a really great job.  And just really kick started my career.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, uh, it's helped me out immensely in the years afterwards --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's all because I've -- I -- I had -- had the -- fortune and -- and the timing in the cycle.  [MN] We were in a up cycle at the time, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my -- I got -- somebody gave me that big shot, and, uh, just -- it worked out well.
R:  Yeah, someone saw something in you that [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably talked their ass to death, that's for sure. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well --
L:  But --
R:  -- sometimes that's what you have to do.
L:  But, yeah, you know -- but minimum wage, it's all about -- it's what you -- what you've got to sell out there, and unfortunately there are a lot of people with skill sets, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- not in -- not in great demand out there.  
R:  That's -- 
L:  And so much of --
R:  -- definitely true.
L:  -- our -- our, um, basic, um, manual labor jobs, of course either gone to the, uh, people from south of the border [SIGH] or they've been, uh, shipped overseas to, uh, somewhere in China [LAUGH] to a person --
R:  That's true.  But the people who do have the certification, or the journeyman status in manual type jobs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- make quite a bit of money. 
L:  Oh, they do.
R:  Quite a bit.
L:  Hell, I met a guy down here who was a, um, foreman of the Texas Highway Department, you know, and he -- he was, basically came to America as a wetback, and got a [inaudible] two years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and made well.  But I guess the point -- my point is, we have a lot of, uh, low skill labor in this country, an oversupply of it, if you will.
R:  Well, all you have to do is go to labor ready to get that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so we've -- we've got over supply of low skill labor, so it's really driven down the -- the -- you know, the -- the overall market need for low skill labor, hence the wage for low skill labor.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, and there's --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- just -- it's an endless -- it's a sea of people who are willing to work for next to nothing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially where I moved from.  I moved from San Diego, which is cri- -- right across the border from Tijuana.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] So, you -- you couldn't find jobs at minimum wage.  They were already all taken, so ... that's --
L:  Oh, that's tough man.  That's just, uh, oh, remember you just -- you know, you gotta have, um, you gotta have the faith in yourself and, uh, and, um, go out there and do it.  Another thing I did too, I got -- of course, I got student loans.  I got one person say, "Oh, I'm not gonna take out a student loan".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I says, "Why?  You don't believe in yourself?" [LAUGH], and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, you gotta have -- you gotta be able to believe in yourself and what you can do, and you know --
R:  Well [MN] --
L:  -- I have no problem, but I get a low interest loan --
