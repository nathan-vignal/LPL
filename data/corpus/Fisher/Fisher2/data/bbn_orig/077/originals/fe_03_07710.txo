L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, I'm Melissa.
L:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Jeremy.
R:  [NOISE] How are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Um, what is it?  The most important ...?
L:  The important --
R:  Characteristic?
L:  In -- in a life partner, right.
R:  Okay, um, [LIPSMACK] hm, I guess for me it would be a tie between sense of humor and, um, just, you know, trustworthiness.  Um ...
L:  Trustworthiness?
R:  Yeah, you know, like somebody who's honest and ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] Um [LIPSMACK] you know?  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but --
L:  It s- -- [LAUGH] It sounds like y- you --
R:  But you know it's really important.
L:  [LAUGH] It sounds like --
R:  I mean, I'm married.
L:  -- you're -- you're des- -- you're describing somebody who's not trustworthy.  
R:   Oh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- no --
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- no, no, no, no.  I'm just saying, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's important in a marriage and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- um, I guess, you know, sense of humor's really important too but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] A sense of humor without, you know, someone who's honest might not be too good.  But, um ...
L:  I hear ya.  Um, that it -- that -- I -- I -- I think sense of humor is -- is -- is absolutely necessary.  I c- completely agree with you.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Trustworthy -- +trustworthy threw me for a second though.  Um, and I don't know what, uh -- I guess considerate which is not all that [NOISE] different from trust -- trustworthy --
R:  I guess that's --
L:  I guess.
R:  -- what I mean, yeah, yeah, con- --
L:  Um, somebody's who's got your issues in mind as much as their own.
R:  Right.
L:  I guess.  That's -- that's love.  How about that?
R:  Right, right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]
L:  But then -- then again I'm a single guy and all I know about love is what I see on TV so ...
R:  Right, right.  
L:  Ah [NOISE] --
R:  Well, I mean I'm married --
L:  -- [NOISE] 
R:  -- and I have two kids so, I mean, that sense of humor thing definitely [MN] you've gotta have.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You're just not gonna make it.  You know, but, um ...
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, do you -- do you think sense of humor is as important before you have kids or is it ...?
R:  More?  No, I think it's more important afterwards.  Because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, there's times where, you know, you're just so frazzled and your day's just crazy and then, you know, if you -- you've gotta have that or you're just gonna hate each other.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I mean it's -- it's obviously a [MN] -- it -- I mean, it was im- -- depends on the person, I guess, but for me it was important just as a -- you know, when I first met somebody like an attraction kind of thing but, you know -- [LIPSMACK] as -- once you have kids and -- or when, you know, you know, when it -- y- your life gets crazy, it's good to have otherwise, you just -- could be depressing, you know.
L:  See, that's -- that's why you're smarter than me about this stuff because y- you [MN] it -- the -- the way you talk about it makes so much sense that it -- like once you have kids and a family --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it -- it's -- it's like y- y- you need this partnership.
R:  Right.
L:  A- a- as opposed to kind of somebody who makes your life more interesting as a single -- not a single couple but a childless couple.
R:  Right.
L:  Y- you -- when you have kids, I guess, al- alternatively you need -- you need somebody who -- who helps you more than interests you, maybe?  I -- I don't --
R:  Yeah.  It --
L:  -- know if I'm misinterpreting but ...
R:  No, I know what you mean.  It like -- it turns into -- I mean, not to say that there's not moments --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where it's still like -- but it's -- it's n- -- you've gotta be willing to, you know, forego some of the like, uh, about it being all about, you know, the two of you and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so ...  That's hard.  Like when you first -- like, you know, when you first have your first child it's like, "Oh, wow".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I think it's harder for the guy because, you know -- like for me I was so into the baby thing and --
L:  Right --
R:  -- doing all of it --
L:  -- right, right, right.
R:  -- I think he was like, "Wait a second" [LAUGH] you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] [MN] "What about me?" but -- so that's -- I don't know, I mean, for me it -- for me it was, uh -- [MN] my husband's like really a pr- pretty funny guy just in general so I mean h- the fact that he can make me laugh when I'm upset or you know, everything's crazy or I'm worried about the kids and that -- that's a big deal but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't [LAUGH].
L:  That -- that's -- that's -- no, that -- I -- y- you know, it's -- it's such an obvious -- not an obvious question but it's a question that seems like it wouldn't be so difficult.
R:  Right.
L:  To have to -- to have to, you know, er, but, uh -- but in a short period of time, you've said something that actually, er, makes me think.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How -- how old are you?
L:  I'm twenty nine.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm thirty so ...
L:  Oh, all right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um ...
L:  We're just -- we're just in very different [MN] spaces in life, that's all.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, a lot -- I mean, you know -- m- we -- we married -- well, we met in College and married pretty soon after college so ...  But I mean most of my friends are either, you know, not married yet or j- you know, m- my friends from before were -- are not married yet or they're just now getting married or ...  I'm actually one of the few people that like from my group of friends in school that are -- is already -- has kids and stuff.  [LAUGH] I'm actually --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think people are, you know, doing that later.  Which is good too but, um ...
L:  Well, are you from a city or -- or from like [MN] [MN] ...?  I -- I -- I guess are you from the coast or are you from, kind of --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- midwest?
R:  Oh no, I -- I'm from the coast.
L:  Okay.  
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I think it -- it seems like I'm originally from -- well, I'm orig- -- I don't know like what we're supposed to say here but I'm -- I'm --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- originally from New York.  Um --
R:  Right
L:  And went to school in Philly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, uh, uh -- not all but the vast majority of my friends are unmarried at this point.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, they're the same -- same age as me [inaudible].
R:  Right.
L:  Um, but it seem- -- and I'm -- but I'm in Colorado now and -- and out here it seems like people are, uh, much more eager --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to kind of get married, get a job, settle down --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it's just kind of a different -- different perspective, that's all.
R:  Yeah, and I don't -- like I think I always thought I'd get married like -- like, you know, initially, like if you had asked me when I was twenty one I would have said, "Oh, I think I'm not gonna get married 'til like my thirties" but, you know, then it just happens and I don't know, to me like when you find the person that you -- you know, you're not gonna say, "Well, I'm not ready" or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- d- I guess, you know, depending on ...  Some p- some people would I guess but [LAUGH] for me it was just, you know.
L:  This is a bizarre conversation to be having with a stranger.
R:  I know and it's weird --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- right?
L:  Like -- like it whoa.  When -- when I heard the topic I was like, "Ooh, okay".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Are from the city in New York or, um, like from ..."
L:  I'm from the su- from the suburbs.
R:  Suburbs, okay, 'cause I have family that lives there.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and then -- and my friend lives in the city and she actually is someone who just got married a couple of months ago but like I don't think she'll ever have kids but sh- -- but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she's, you know, my age and ju- [MN] really like I -- I -- I can't think of any of my friends -- you know, I have friends now that I've met, you know, just in my life now.  You know, through my husband or th- through my kids or whatever that -- that are [MN] my age but most, you know, the people I know from like school th- still don't have kids, they're still not --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, just now getting into that like lifestyle so it's weird --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because, you know.
L:  Well, y- my -- my best friend is getting married, uh, next month.  And just getting back to, I guess, the t- -- the topic at hand --
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  Um [LAUGH].  Um, y- you know, he -- he's like pretty -- he's a pretty dirty guy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and [MN] I -- I, uh -- I never would have expected it but at -- at one point he just -- he's just like, you know, "I met her and she's -- she's cool and she calms me down and, er, you know --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- I -- I thought I needed --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- all these things from my --".  He didn't use the word life partner but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- since, you know?
R:  Well, who does?  [LAUGH]
L:  That's [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's just that we're supposed to.  Uh, it's like -- he's like, you know, I didn't -- I didn't know exactly what -- what would click with, you know -- with the -- with the girl that end up with him.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  And -- and I'm surprised that it is what it is.  But, um, yeah, I think his [SIGH] -- his, uh -- his priorities in, you know, what was most important in selecting a mate --
R:  Right.
L:  -- changed.
R:  Right.  I guess that everybody has like their own idea of what's the most important thing, you know?  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not the same for everybody but [SIGH] for some people it might just be, you know, [MN] that they're fine or whate- -- you know what I'm saying but --
L:  Right.
R:  It just depends on, you know -- I have friends that [MN] [LAUGH] definitely don't have the same, uh, ideas that I have about it but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but for me I would say like in -- you know, I'm sitting -- I came up with that o- offhand but, you know, just the first thing I could think of is like sense of humor and someone who's caring or, you know [SIGH] [MN] -- you know, s- --
L:  Right.  I didn't --
R:  Not selfish.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.  So, y- you're describing the ideal person to sh- like share a life with.
R:  Right, as opposed --
L:  -- not necessarily --
R:  -- to just date, right?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  It's not -- not necessarily the best person to like take on a vacation to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Rio for a weekend but --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that sense of humor would be good for that too, I guess.  At least for me but ...
L:  Yeah, no, you're right.  You're right but it doe- -- the priorities definitely shift.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But ...
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] ...
L:  [SIGH] Ah, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Hey, this is a -- this is a pretty easy question, that's the problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um ...
R:  I mean, it -- it's not like so --
L:  But, right.
R:  -- like you're gonna debate on it, you know.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Like "No, they don't need a sense of humor".
L:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah.
R:  What would you have said like w- was the most important thing, you know, if someone had asked you -- [MN] a friend had asked you, you know?
L:  Er, like in a -- in a -- in a girlfriend, you mean?
R:  Right, right --
L:  But would it [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- like for a wife or for, uh, someone you're gonna live with?  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeh.  [SIGH] [MN] Um, I --
