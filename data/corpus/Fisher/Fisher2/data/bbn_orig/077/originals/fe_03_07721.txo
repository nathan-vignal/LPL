L:  Hi, my name is Nancy.  I'm in California.
R:  Hi, Nancy.  This is Emily and I'm in Oregon.  So, most important thing to look for in a life partner, I would definitely to have say is honesty.
L:  I was gonna say -- I agree with that.  I was gonna say a sense of humor.
R:  Yeah.  Yes, that is important as well.  Definitely.
L:  But I think -- I think honesty comes before that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you ...
R:  Honesty -- honesty is pretty important I think.
L:  Yeah.  If you can't trust then you don't really have anything.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Which makes it -- I have been thinking about this.  Um, I've met a few people that have gotten married just right away after meeting some- somebody and I'm just, um, actually confused on how they know that this person is completely honest.  They haven't even given them enough time to know that person and so I think -- I mean, someone can be honest, you know, with you for a week, but you really have to get know the person a little bit longer to know their -- some of their character I would think.
L:  Yeah.  People can put up a -- a facade --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that'll last, um, for a short while, but it doesn't last forever --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and soon as the facade is dropped then the real person comes in.
R:  Yes.  Definitely.  A sense of humor is important though too.  I agree with that as well and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- why was it you would say that though?  I mean ...
L:  Well, because at times life can be pretty grim, but if you can't find the humor in it, um --
R:  You're doomed.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you're kinda lost.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'd agree with that definitely.  Yeah.  Life can be pretty stressful, um, especially with the economy and, you know, if people didn't have a sense of humor I guess it can make for some pretty hard or -- or pretty hard home life and a lotta stress at home.
L:  Yeah.  But, uh, what -- what you said about people getting married before they really know one another --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that is so true --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and when they do -- when they do start to get to know the real person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they married sometimes they don't love that person --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- that that person can be very unlovable.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  What's funny is I've been with my fiancee now four years.  Um, we'll be married next May and I knew for, you know, a long time now that he's the one.  But, um, to be honest I don't think even a year after we were together that we would've been ready just because we didn't know each other well enough and even in the last -- I mean, a year's not bad -- but I just -- it just surprises me that some people get married after knowing each other for two weeks and so I just don't understand.  Oh, my gosh [LAUGH], that's pretty amazing.  You just ...
L:  Why the long engagement for you?
R:  Um, the reason is we've been actually -- this sounds really funny -- but we've been, um -- we had a child together really early on and we lost that child and we've been going through, um, a lot of fertility treatments and things like that and it seems really kinda strange since we're not married, um, but just kind of concentrating on that.  He knows how much I -- that I want kids and he's just scared that if we can't have kids together that, um, it would make it really hard on us because he actually has a daughter and that's -- that issue has made it hard for the fact that he has a daughter with somebody else and we haven't been able to have our own kid, a healthy child together.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, he's been worried.  But I'm actually expecting next month with twins.  So, we're doing well.  We were actually planning to get married this last May, but his mother passed away and so -- but it's been ...
L:  Did you say you're -- you're gonna have a baby next month?
R:  Yep.  Yes, we are.  We're having twins.
L:  Wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, thank you very much.  We're really excited and I think, you know, just everything that we went through has been really trying 'cause I've had three miscarriages plus we lost our son.  We found we were carriers of Spinal Muscular Atrophy and that really -- you know, even though that was a horrible thing to go through it was great, um, in getting to know him better and knowing what he was really like inside and probably the same for him for me, um, just because that can be so trying we got to know each other much better, um, and now there's nothing that I really worry about because he's been completely honest and some things that I have liked and some things that I haven't liked, but now I know what I'm getting myself into for sure.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And how old is his child?
R:  His daughter is going to be five in August.  We've been together since she was eight months old.
L:  Oh, okay.  And do you know what sex your twins are?
R:  Yep, they're both girls.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  That is great.
R:  Well, thank you very much.
L:  I had two sets of twins.  They were both boy and girl.
R:  Oh, wow!  That's neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Neat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Both ...
L:  Yeah, it was neat.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I liked it.
R:  Yeah.  I'm looking forward to it and -- so -- and this is another place, you know, I guess with the kids coming where he's been very honest and it's something that I can expect because he's not looking forward to the baby stage, um, just because he's not really good with crying babies and he's scared to hold them in case he might drop them or not sure what, you know, they want.  But at least he's honest and that's another thing that I'm not gonna get myself stuck into once we get married and have kids not knowing, you know, if he were to lie to me and then I found out later that he had a hard time.  That'd be more difficult.  So, I'm thinking ...
L:  And you -- and you also know what kind of a parent he is.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And so that's very important too.  So, yeah.
L:  So, do you -- do you live together?
R:  Yes, we have actually for the entire time we've been together --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- for -- for about four years now --
L:  Good.  Okay.
R:  -- and we've gotten -- we've gotten to know each other really well.  So ...
L:  Did -- did you ever ask him what he thought was the most important attribute in a marriage?
R:  He -- you know, we have talked about that before and I know honesty is a big thing, but I think for him the most important thing is that you -- you're supportive of each other and that's the most important thing for him and the fact that, um, I am supportive of him or he is supportive of me because if you're not supportive of each other, you know, whether right or wrong, or try to through it together, it probably isn't gonna work --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so that could be -- that I think is another good attribute because if you're not gonna be supportive then what's the point?
L:  Sure.  It's not a competition.  It's a partnership.
R:  Exactly.  You have to work toward the same goal instead of [LAUGH] against each other, towards separate goals I would think.
L:  So, honesty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and loyalty certainly.
R:  Loyalty.  Definitely.  Loyalty is very important.
L:  Um, so what have we come up with?  Honesty, loyalty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a sense of humor, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- support.
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I was just thinking of -- of the attributes that we'd come up with.
R:  Right.  I didn't hear the one last you said.
L:  Oh, support.  Supportive.
R:  Oh, support.  Yes, supportive, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would have to say those are probably my top -- my top picks for ...
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sort of universal, um -- universal characteristics that you need in friends and lovers too.
R:  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  You would expect those same things as your best friend or close friends or even relatives I would hope.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that's like a general rule I guess, or the general idea of any relationship, whether it's your life partner or friends or family.
L:  I wonder what they're gonna do with all this research that they're doing.
R:  I'm not sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  Is -- is -- have you taken a couple of calls?
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  Yeah, I have too.
R:  Yes.  Um, yeah, I don't know.  It's -- it's kinda neat to know as far as the ideas they come up with for you to talk about because this one's a good -- a good one 'cause it really gets you to thinking ...
L:  Yeah.  All of the calls that -- that I've had --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, after I hung up it really started me thinking about things.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Maybe that's the purpose of the research.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  To get people to think.  [LAUGH]
R:  You never know.  So, what do you, um -- do you have a life partner and do they -- does that person -- is there anything you're noticing in your relationship that seems to be a pretty important attribute?
L:  Um, I think consistency.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's important.
R:  Mhm.  I agree with that.
L:  Um, I -- I think that's important to me because I tend to be kinda flighty and ...
R:  Because you tend to be flighty you said?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or they do?
L:  No, I do.
R:  Oh, you do.
