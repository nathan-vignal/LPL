L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Aye.
R:  Hi, I'm Glenda.  [MN] 
L:  Hi, um, the topic is, ah, what do you look for in a life partner, right?
R:  Right.
L:  The most important that is, um, go first.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Me first?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well, I -- I have a lot of ideas it's just I never end up with that person.  Um -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I know, I think they should be more, like a goal oriented person, you know, where they're actually able to get work done.  [MN] 
L:  [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  'Cause if -- you know, if they're too lazy, they're never going to, you know, get anywhere and you're going to be upset with them a lot.  [MN] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  That's one of my ideas.
L:  [MN] I was thinking, "Intelligence".  Someone that knows -- that knows, like, what you're looking for and has the intelligence to actually, you know, try to be that someone or, like, to become what you want.  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And not just sit around, basically.  Be a -- and, um, hm, [MN] a life partner.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [SIGH] 
R:  Um, I'm just kind of going off of, um, who I have dated and what was -- what were their flaws and that was -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the reason why I broke up with them.  So, I'm narrowing down what the life, you know, things are.  Like, um, [MN] I don't know, they -- they should be somebody that's not really a needy person.  Like, they don't need you to be around them all the time.  Um, they can actually function without you.  That's always a really [MN] important thing for me, personally.
L:  True.  I mean, you don't want them clinging on to you.  But, it -- it -- it is, um, it -- it's nice in a way.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah.  I kn- -- I'm -- I'm not saying that I -- I -- I don't want to ever see them but I don't want somebody that, um, will, you know, make you stay on the phone with them all the time and -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't really have your own social time either so -- 
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- that's what I mean by not needy.  You can have your own -- 
L:  But -- 
R:  -- life too.
L:  But doesn't it kind of merge once you're married though, like, your social life and his, or like -- you know?
R:  Well, I -- I've talked a lot to married people and they seem to think that even if you're married you really need to have your own space or else you're going to just fight and start to hate one [LAUGH] another.  So, you -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- need to have your own friends and your own hobbies or else you're just doomed to failure.  [MN] 
L:  Oh, really?  Hm.  That's -- 
R:  That's just what -- 
L:  -- just int- -- 
R:  -- I've heard.
L:  Oh, well -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- I -- I don't really know -- I -- I don't talk to that many couples 'cause, um, ah -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- well, my parents, they -- you know, they -- but, they're like, you know, socializes basically the same, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they have the same hobbies.  They do the same things together and they seem to be fine right now.  I mean -- 
R:  Wow.  Well, mine -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are divorced.  So, I know that -- that they really did need to have more time on their own.  So, and -- and that would have helped them because when they actually did get divorced they were really short on friends and they started doing, like, searches on line to meet people.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So -- because they didn't, you know, try hard enough to -- to keep their own time so, um, that's why it's one of my top needs.  [MN] I -- 
L:  Ah, someone -- 
R:  -- don't know.
L:  -- that's independent basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Without you.  Hm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Yeah -- 
R:  That would be good.
L:  -- yeah, um, yeah, I mean, I -- I'm not sure yet.  I mean, people I've dated it's like it's sort of I notice what I don't like so far.  It's, ah, I -- I don't, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like I know what I don't like now but it's not like I know exact- -- I know some things I like but it's like I don't know everything, you know? 
R:  Right.  Well, I'm just trying to go for the must have or else I'll just -- 
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- not be happy because, um, like I'm dating somebody right now that's a total not marriage material.  Not a life partner person because like they've got -- um, this sounds really shallow but they have bad credit history and like they haven't really made anything out of themselves and they're, you know, at an age where I feel that they should have done a lot of things.  So, um -- 
L:  Then why are -- 
R:  -- I think -- 
L:  -- you still dating him?
R:  What?  Why?
L:  Why?  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, because I'm not looking for a life partner right now and -- and he is very entertaining which is one of my other things.  But, um, if you're going to actually stay with a person they need to have that goal oriented frame of mind.  They have to be financially secure and they need to have all that taken care of.
L:  Right.  Right.  See it's -- ah, yeah, I mean, I want to be entertained sometimes but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I want to be like -- now there's times when I want to be fun, you know?  And -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there are times when I want to be goal oriented, you know?  I mean -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it doesn't really mix at all.  Like, if I'm -- I'm not having fun it's just no way I can, like, be goal oriented, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  It's no way I can get anything done and to be that exciting it's just -- it requires time and you know, energy.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  It -- it -- ah, which takes away from the whole goal oriented thing.  So, it's like it has to be one or the other.  It doesn't really mix, you know, as well as it -- 
R:  I don't -- I don't know.  Sometimes people that are fugal oriented get really kind of crazy on this [inaudible] like, I'm a teacher and teachers go nuts on the weekends sometimes.  Like -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, they'll be some of the biggest partiers you've ever met because they're so driven and they do so much during the week that they just need some kind of release.  So, like, they kind of get the best of both worlds but two extremes.
L:  [LAUGH] What grade do you teach?
R:  Seventh.  But -- 
L:  That -- 
R:  -- that's off task or off -- off our conversation.
L:  Oh -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- okay, so what?  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [several inaudible words] -- um, sorry?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] You're not allowed to do that, are you -- 
R:  No, we're -- 
L:  -- kidding me?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- not.  So, um, on the topic, let's see, um -- 
L:  What else do you have then?  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  What else do I have?  I want somebody that's really comfortable within themselves and they usually make me pretty comfortable with them.  Like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they'll do things that -- I don't know, I'm not really -- I want somebody that's going to extend my mind and will -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do things that I'm not normally, ah, one to do because I -- I sometimes get a little stuck in my minds.  I'm -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- very stubborn.  So -- 
L:  Yeah, I mean, ah, I -- I get what you're saying.  Someone that's like -- that's able to laugh at themselves and you know -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have the time and just -- that's true -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that, you're right.  I mean, I can see that happening.  Hm.
R:  But, those are fun people too.  And -- and usually -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those people are not the -- the goal orien- oriented financially stable people either.
L:  Yeah -- 
R:  So, that's kind of a bummer.
L:  -- as usually.  Usually -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- usually it's a -- that's a main word.  You know, that -- you have [several inaudible words] between [several inaudible words] people, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, it's just mainly you see [several inaudible words], like, you know, I mean, that -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- workaholics a lot, I think some of them -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, are like -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- partiers too.  I mean, y- y- -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  One or the other.
L:  Or party, yeah, it's -- it just doesn't -- it -- it -- 
R:  No middle man.
L:  -- yeah.  There -- it -- there are, but it's hard to find, you know?  I mean -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  Um, let's see.  Oh, yeah, I had this one person that I dated who actually was, um, made me so uncomfortable that I would get physically ill.  So, I put that on my -- like, when I was thinking about this for a second, I w- -- 
L:  Why did you -- 
R:  -- I thought -- 
L:  -- date him then?
R:  I know.  Well, you know, that's why I stopped.  So, [LAUGH] like, you know -- 
L:  Well, why did you date him in the first place?  I don't under- -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- okay.
R:  -- ah, well I -- I don't want to get into my past relationships but you know, it's somebody that you really love and you've known him for ten, fifteen years and you don't want to just drop it off.  So, um, I used to kind of stick with it a little bit longer than you should.  And, um -- 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but somebody -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that kind of makes me feel -- like, use of myself and you know, doesn't -- makes me very unhappy all the time.  And, um -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that goes along with the not needy thing, I think.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I see what you say.
R:  Yeah.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  I know, do you -- 
L:  -- I mean -- 
R:  -- have any other ideas?
L:  Ah, someone who's not as controlling.  I mean, there are times when there's someone's like so -- um, there's no controlling a girl like that, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like, it's just little stuff too.  It's not like they tell you what to be or like they want you to be like, you know?  They don't want to tell you like, "Oh, I want you to be -- be a doctor" but they're like -- they're -- they're like, they command you to do everything, you know?
R:  Yeah, or people -- 
L:  And even if it's -- 
R:  -- that just kind of make those little comments on the side, like, um, [MN] ah, let's see, if you don't clean enough or if you do something that they don't really approve of or your hair should be [inaudible] -- just little things, those comments -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- that make you feel like kind of less.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- ah, they're just little stuff like I was going to do anyway but, said, "Because you, like, are commanding me to do it I feel like I'm just like" you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like, I -- I'm just doing it because you said it.  Yeah, it's like it happens so much that it's like, what the hell, am I -- am I doing it just because you said it or am I doing it because I want to, you know?  You know?
R:  Right.  Right.  So -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you don't want the -- ah, that's bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.  That's annoying -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when people are like that.  [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, um -- 
L:  But, you've got -- you've got -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH] Mm -- 
R:  [MN] Let me think.  [MN] [NOISE] I don't know -- 
L:  I guess -- how about the age range?  Do you think the -- ah, how old would you, like -- you know?  I mean, how many years --  
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- like, would -- 
R:  -- you know, I think that that depends on how old you are at the moment 'cause it seems like as you get older your age range gets a little bit wider.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, like -- 
L:  That's really -- 
R:  -- in college you may not date anybody past twenty five or something like that.  I don't know, but, like, people always have their ranges.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And as you get older it -- it expands because -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you kind of get more experiences and you start matching up with older individuals so, um, like I would personally date anybody that's ten years older than me and have no problem with it.  Um, some people might not do that.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it depends what you're comfortable with and --  
R:  [MN] -- 
L:  -- yeah, how -- 
R:  I think that -- I think that that is -- a -- a reasonable, ah, a, um, age difference because, um, like there's not that much difference in what's happening in the world and they can't really pull the parent figure, kind of, "I know more than you" thing.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, which, you know, older people like to do.  So -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, that -- that's what I think.  Like a ten year difference is okay.  [MN] 
L:  But, then ten years' later they're more driven.  They're like, you know -- it -- it's -- they're like -- they're not -- they're past -- the partiers are, like, past that stage, most of them -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I'm thinking, you know?  I mean, it's like, yeah, I had -- I had my fun, now it's time, ah, to get my life on track.  You know?
R:  Not necessarily.
L:  Mm.
R:  Like, I know some -- I know forty five, fifty year olds who like to go out and party and go to bars and hang out and just do all sorts of stuff.  So [MN] -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I mean, you decide what you're going to be like and you don't have to settle down and -- and watch TV every night.  It's really up to the person what they want to do.  [MN] So, if you choose a person that's more active and wants to go out and do things and, um, they're probably going to be doing that when they're older too.
