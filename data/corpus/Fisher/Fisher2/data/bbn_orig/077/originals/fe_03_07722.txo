L:  Good morning.
R:  Yes.  My name is Lorie.
L:  Lorie.  I'm calling from Los Angeles.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Los Angeles as well which kind of surprised me that -- when they said the increase to five dollars and fifteen cents is appropriate.  What state do you think -- they think -- talking about?
L:  I just heard the topic is life partners.  What is the most important topic of life partners.  So, that's our conversation.
R:  Okay, um, I was under the impression the -- okay.  Let's talk about life partners.  What do you find is important in a life partner?
L:  [LAUGH] There's a lot of issues.  [MN] The number w- -- 
R:  What is the most important?
L:  The number one thing is you got to talk with the person.  I mean, you can have sex, you could, you know, think they're really beautiful and all that, even talk real well for, like, you know, a month or two.  But, after the honeymoon wears off you got to be able to sit down after a day's work and say, "Honey, how are you?  What are you doing?"  You know, "Whats -- how are you feeling?"  What do you think? 
R:  Well, I think, number one that the -- when you pick your life partner it has to be somebody that you feel that you can talk to every day for the rest of your life.  This is the person you're going to have to talk to every single day.
L:  But, things -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- change.  I mean, people -- what happens, ah, just maybe somebody wants to have more romance, more sex.  I mean, maybe these people go to, like, the strip clubs because, you know -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- their -- 
R:  -- I think that communication's important in a relationship as far as when interest is starting to get lost or maybe things are getting a little humdrum and I think that a little spice, ah, could be necessary in all -- 
L:  I don't know about that.  I wouldn't want my girl, like, cheating on my just because -- 
R:  No, spice -- 
L:  -- we -- 
R:  -- between the two partners.  So -- 
L:  Do you have a s- -- do you have a life partner?
R:  I do have a life partner.  Well, I don't have a life partner.  I have just been with somebody for a long time.  Um, and you?
L:  No. Not at the moment, um, but -- 
R:  So, what -- 
L:  -- one -- 
R:  -- attracts you to a woman?
L:  Well, you -- I ha- -- you know, to be honest with you -- I don't mean to sound superficial but, um, there has to be some type of physical attraction, um, you -- you know, to something, um, and then the communication's there.  Ah, is -- ah, is attraction -- I mean, is that a factor for you or is it just, ah, being --  
R:  It's the very -- 
L:  -- able to communicate?
R:  -- big attraction.  I mean, attraction is it -- it -- there's got to be chemistry or you can't get beyond that.  You can't get mon cherie without some kind of chemistry.  But, you know, just to change the subject briefly, Michael, when I called in just now they told me that the topic was the increase of minimum wage to the five dollars and fifteen cents.  I'm a -- 
L:  Okay, look -- 
R:  -- little confused at w- -- should we -- a little touch on that as well?
L:  Yeah.  Let's tou- touch on that then because when I just called they just said, "Your topic is life partners, the most --" 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- important thing".  So --" 
R:  Um, what state do you think they're referring to for five fifteen because here in the state of California it's six seventy five an hour starting January first, two thousand three.
L:  How do you know that?
R:  Um, 'cause we -- at work we have it posted here in the kitchen.
L:  I see.  Six seventy five.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.  And -- and it was six twenty five in two thousand one.
L:  Okay -- 
R:  In the two thousand two and then it switched.
L:  When I hear that I think that's a pretty good wage.  I mean, what do you think?
R:  Six seventy five an hour?  Well -- 
L:  As a minimum wage.
R:  [MN] I think that, ah, it would only bring in a full time employee about, after taxes, maybe eight hundred a month and I know rents here in Los Angeles, and that's where I live and you're -- you -- you're from Los --
L:  I -- 
R:  -- Angeles as well -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- can you find -- I mean, have you see that there's many places to rent in a nice neighbourhood that you can get and pay all your utilities and your food for eight hundred a month?
L:  That's a good question.  I w- -- I would think if there's a double income family or maybe three people contributing, ah -- 
R:  So, you think that -- 
L:  -- just the -- 
R:  -- there's -- it should be -- you think that -- you know, and let's talk for a minute on the five fifteen an hour.  Let's assume that this is going to be in a state where rent is probably maybe three hundred dollars a month. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or four hundred a month because that -- so obviously in a state that is paying under five dollars an hour minimum wage, like, right now, so the rent there has got to be -- you know, the cost of living in that state -- 
L:  It's lower.
R:  It's got to be much lower, so -- 
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- do you think that it would be -- do you think it's fair to have three people living in one -- a one bedroom just to make ends meet?
L:  Well, we have things in L.A. -- ah, probably the other place, called section eight which is, like, if you make below a certain level, the city or the county of Los Angeles will kind of supplement your rent or you can qualify for -- I don't -- food stamps.  I guess that for some -- it depends on whether you have kids or not.  So, it's not like we let people fall through the cracks.  Um, I think minimum wage is just like a liveable wage per -- if someone just didn't -- 
R:  It's a barely liveable wage.
L:  Right.  Well, what if -- what if there was not a minimum wage?
R:  Well, that wouldn't be good because then people would be taking advantage of -- oh, the immigrants that come in at all and such.  But, ah, there should be a minimum wage.  There actually should be some k- -- or people would be working for two dollars an hour and that would just, you know, take back --  
L:  Well, I've heard an argument on the other side saying, well, in a capitalist society, I mean, it's supply and demand.  You know what the market will bear and the same thing for the job market, that there should not be a minimum wage because it's the higher education will get the higher jobs and the -- 
R:  Do you think it's fair to take advantage of somebody because they don't have education and pay 'em a dollar or two dollars an hour?
L:  That's a good question.  I haven't run that.  I haven't really thought about that, like, really deeply whether it should or should not be minimum wage but I guess -- for now I guess there should be 'cause there -- it -- it does protect a certain level of society.
R:  Well, let's say there -- that the minimum wage is applying right now into a small town in Minne- -- in, ah, Michigan, let's say, or -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- In- -- or Indiana.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where rent would probably, I'm sure, be anywhere between maybe three and eight hundred depending on what size of a place you end up getting or even more.  Do you feel that [MN] they -- the people out in wherever they're talking about making four dollars and something an hour, do you think that is a reasonable pay?  Would you like to work eighty hours on a pay check and receive five hundred dollars for those two weeks of work?
L:  I've actually had made minimum wage in my life.  Of course, I was a teenager and probably in -- in my early twenties.  Um, but, if there's another -- ah, no, I th- -- I think five fifteen is probably -- is not sufficient but people can go to school and there are loans and grants where people can get education.
R:  My first job minimum wage was a dollar ninety six an hour.  Isn't that interesting?  So, back to life partners, I guess, since we have to dis- -- you know -- 
L:   Sure.
R:  -- talk on both subjects -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess.  What would you say, um, well, give me your -- 
L:  Let me ask you something else too?
R:  -- ideal -- ideal life partner would be, what, somebody that -- 
L:  My ideal life partner also won't be ha- -- will -- I don't care if she doesn't work or not and I have to support her but she can't be like, you know, just letting herself go and just -- and so I look at her and I have no respect for her.  How about you?
R:  If she gained weight would you tease her?
L:  No.  Never.  Never.
R:  Or just be supportive.  What if -- 
L:  Well, my -- 
R:  -- she just wouldn't lose it?
L:  Well, also money is a -- the weight -- 
R:  You want her to work?
L:  -- isn't the factor.  But, the money is a factor too.  I hear a lot of people, they break up because of money issues.  Let me ask you, I mean, is it important that your -- if your life partner works or has a -- 
R:  Yes.  It is a -- 
L:  -- good job?
R:  It's important that my life partner works up to his earning potential.  Um, I don't think that he should take two dollar, you know, or two day a week jobs part time and -- and I, for instance, cover most of the household expenses while -- while he just has to cover a little bit of it and then he has more of the freedom.  Ah, I don't think it's fair.  I mean, it all changes, of course, when you have kids and -- 
L:  That's another good point.  Children.  I mean, children are another im- important thing for life partners because that little kid is, you know, part of your and his life.  How does that affect?  Is that important for you and your husband?  Who teaches them?  Who -- who -- do you want to -- 
R:  Both.
L:  -- raise them Jewish or Catholic.  I mean, if you're -- if you're separate religions.
R:  I think you need to have a sit down conversation on just about every level of how to raise your children.  I think it's, ah, both a male and the female's responsibility.  Of course, ah, it -- when I was growing up it was wait till your father came home.  Ah, so, it made you afraid of your father. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, your father really never hurt you but you were still afraid of him because of that phrase and you'd sit in your bedroom scared.  I don't know if that ever happened to you.  But, ah, I think that -- I think that both male -- the male and the female should play a role in how to raise a child and -- and with religion, that gets into a whole another topic whether marriages can work with different religions.
L:  Was it important for you and your life partner to have the -- to bel- -- to have the same belief system?
R:  Well, I really never gave it much thought.  I don't know if -- ah, I'm not Jewish, but if I met a Jewish man w- -- I'd -- if he was Orthodox I don't think I could, because I don't understand it.  I wouldn't understand, well, why do you have to do this or that or that or this or why do you believe in this or that or this and why is it so strict that you have to do this and that or this and that.  So, I don't think I could -- would probably get myself wrapped up into that because that would be one of the chemical or one of the, ah, the attractions that probably would not be there.  The chemistry.  I don't think it would initially be there.  What about you?  Would you -- are you Jewish or are you -- 
L:  I'm -- to be honest with you I'm -- I'm -- I -- I am -- what they say, a [MN] -- 
R:  Agnostic?
L:  -- a heathen.  [LAUGH]   I'm a heathen -- 
R:  You're a heathen.
L:  He- H. -- 
R:  Well, that I -- 
L:  -- heathen with an H.
R:  -- a heathen.  That is really -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- saying that you're just a bad boy, aren't you Michael?
L:  You know, I had this step mother named Margarita and she wasn't really good to me and that's -- I don't want to get into that right now but --
