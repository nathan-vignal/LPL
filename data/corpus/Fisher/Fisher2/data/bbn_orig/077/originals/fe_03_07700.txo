L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Are you there?
L:  Yes.
R:  Um, my name is Susan Rebatta.[?]
L:  I'm Kim.
R:  Um, I live outside of Atlanta.
L:  I'm in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  You're getting a lotta rain right now, huh?
R:  [NOISE] Um, we've gotten a break today.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, that's good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, really it hasn't been too bad around our house, but some of the --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- some of the other metro areas ...
L:  I know I've seen pictures on the news I'm like [MN].
R:  Yeah.  Um, it's been -- pretty much the spring it's been raining.  [LAUGH]
L:  Great, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, I kinda misunderstood the subject at first when they said life partners.  I thought that it was gonna be a gay issue.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  But when they said what are you looking for in a life partner ...
L:  Um, the last thing I heard was, uh, what's the most important thing to look for in a life partner?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, for me it -- it was religious belief 'cause it's important to me and that's how I wanted to raise my children.
L:  Oh, that's a good one.
R:  So, that's what I was ...  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you don't want theirs to different too much --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if that's something very important to you.
R:  Right.  Um ...
L:  Um, to me [LAUGH] ...  I'm -- I'm sorry.  I have my little one here having to tell me something.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, for me a big one was just somebody you can be yourself with, you know?
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  I mean, shoot, if it's gonna last for a lifetime you don't wanna have to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- putting on for a lifetime, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  So, somebody you can just be yourself with and laugh when you need to or cry or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- whatever it takes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to get through the day.  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't have to worry about him walking out if you get hysterical about something one day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Which has, uh, happened once or twice.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fortunately my stepson is, uh, watching my little one so I could talk on the phone.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's nice.  [LAUGH]
R:  Whenever I get the phone -- the number one caller a day -- I looked at him and I said, "I can earn ten dollars.  Can you -- can you watch the ...?"
L:  I know and you're like help.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I'm surprised because I recently signed up and this is already my second phone call in like a week.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, that's pretty good actually.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I had one that I had to hang up on because they -- both of them were running around --
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I was trying to fix supper and everything else.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, this is the first one I've actually done.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, so life partners.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, gosh, what else?  I don't know.  Anything else really important to you besides religion?
R:  Um ...
L:  Religion is important to us too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We wanted to make sure we had the same religious beliefs, not two completely different --
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  -- backgrounds.
R:  Yeah.  Um, oh, mo- motivation I guess or ambition would be one.
L:  Yeah, that's good too.
R:  I mean, not that -- I mean, I wasn't looking for some guy that made a million dollars a year, but somebody that --
L:  Worked hard.
R:  -- you know, had the ambition, that was gonna keep a job --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and that was ...
L:  That is important and especially when you're thinking about a family.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I guess those are my top two.  [LAUGH]
L:  Your top two, religion and ambition.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know ...?
L:  Ambition's a really good one because gosh, I have friends with husbands -- with men and [MN] the things they go through, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, ambition's a really good one and I think somebody too that's gonna -- I don't know -- be a big part of the family, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have those Dads that make a lotta money, but they're never home with the family --
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  -- and to me -- I don't know -- that's not worth the trade off I don't think.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd rather cut coupons and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- wait for a sale than ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Shop for sales and whatever.
R:  Yeah, than --
L:  Me too.
R:  -- than my husband never be home.  Yeah.
L:  Me too.  That's a big one for me.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Right now, um [NOISE] -- and we're going through that right now.  But to me the trade off's totally worth it.  My husband's able to volunteer in the kids' schools --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- at -- at elementary and in high school level and we're around a lot and everybody knows us in the schools --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's important I think.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  And I think the kids will remember that too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I was just thinking today -- well, I went to see my parents, they don't live far from here and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, my father was playing with my kids and I thought I don't remember that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- too much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- from when I was little.
L:  He was busy working to raise ya.
R:  Ex- exactly.  Yeah.  And, um, he worked shift work when I was little.  So, you know, a lotta the times he was asleep when I was awake and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, he's ...
L:  And I so didn't want that.  It's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I mean, if they work in one of those jobs it's like by the time they get home the kids are asleep.
R:  Right.
L:  When they leave the kids are still asleep and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just don't think that builds a relationship.
R:  I have a brother in law that works second shift --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, he gets up -- well, actually he leaves about four or five in the afternoon and gets home about four or five in the morning --
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  -- and he actually wakes up to get the kids off to school because that's the only time he sees them.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  I mean, he's only been asleep two or three hours.
L:  How great of him to sacrifice and do that.
R:  I know.  You know, at first I got upset with their mother and then I realized wait a minute, he asked to do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he offered.  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, she's been sleeping all night and he lets them -- her get up -- him get up.  Uh, somebody has something in their mouth that doesn't be- -- oh, oh, that's handy.  Okay.  [LAUGH]  I'm sorry.
L:  You're like hold on a second.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, she's supposed to have that.  He -- my stepson just gave her some candy.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, candy's okay kinda, sorta, right?
R:  Yeah.  But, um, I'm trying to think.  My -- also my next door neighbor her husband travels probably ninety five percent of the time --
L:  Oh, gosh, that's another thing I wouldn't want I don't think.
R:  -- and they've got a little girl that's almost two --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, uh, there are times when I know she's having a rough day when I say just bring her over and get ...
L:  How nice of you.
R:  You know?  But, you know -- and she -- I mean, she -- she would do the same thing for me I'm sure.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  But, you know, when I have a birthday my husband will be home by four.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When she has her birthday her husband will be home Friday night.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So ...
L:  I don't know.  Somet- -- I don't know if it's worth it.  Well, not in our particular family I don't think it is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I guess it works for some people obviously, but to me it's just not worth it.
R:  Right.  I completely agree with you.
L:  I'd rather have the support here at home --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- than in the checkbook.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, exactly.  [LAUGH]  You know, I -- I've known so many people over the years that said they couldn't afford to stay home once they had children.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But then they were spending money left and right.
L:  Oh, yeah, 'cause if you have it you're gonna spend it.
R:  Yeah, and, "Oh, I just can't afford to stay home".
L:  You're like really?
R:  Yeah, and as a matter of fact when I was pregnant with my first one somebody said, "Well, I wish I was married to a rich man" --
L:  Oh, gosh!
R:  -- and -- and I thought oh, no, no.
L:  And you thought if you only knew, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  You know, I hated to snap back at her, but at the same time I was thinking, you know, we're not gonna have it easy, but it's worth the sacrifice.
L:  Oh, definitely.
R:  So ...
L:  I have to agree with you there.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  But, you know, that was also the thing that I wanted somebody that agreed with me staying home --
L:  Yeah, your whole ...
R:  -- because that was gonna be a big issue if they didn't wanna me to stay ...
L:  If not.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That wasn't gonna work at all.
L:  Yeah, and that's a good one too and I've always stayed home with our kids --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we have two teenagers and a six year old.  The six year old was a complete surprise 'cause our other ones are seventeen and fifteen.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Oh, well, what are ya gonna do?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  And, yeah, I think that's an important part too.
R:  Yeah.  But, I mean ...
L:  And I don't think that's something you can do without the support of your husband or your spouse --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, because --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it just won't work.
R:  Yeah.  Well, this is the easiest ten dollars I think I've ever made.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I know.  Not bad at all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  At first I thought I was gonna feel so funny talking to complete strangers, but it's not been bad.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was your first subject about?
L:  Um, what was it?  Oh, holidays.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Uh-huh.  It was what is your favorite one and why and if you could create one what would it be?
R:  Oh, that's a fun ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was kinda fun.
R:  Huh.  M- my daughter asked me the other day, "Why isn't there a kids' day?" --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I said, "Every day is kids' day".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no kidding.  [LAUGH]
R:  But she -- I mean, she said, "We just had Mother's Day and now it's Father's Day, where's kids' day?"
L:  Oh, boy.  Let's see.
R:  And I thought hmm.
L:  That would be a good one.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh!
R:  But -- so that's ...  Uh -- this is kind of an interesting study.  I really thought it was gonna be some kind of deep --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- you know ...?
L:  Things I had no idea about or know what to say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But so far --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- it's been okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Life partners.  We've been ...  How long have you been married?
R:  Six years.
L:  Oh, we've been married eighteen years.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yep.
R:  And haven't killed each other yet, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Not yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what my mother always said.
L:  And we've only had a couple of close calls.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, gosh!
R:  I have a, um -- a two year old and a five year old --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and then my stepchildren are fifteen, nineteen and twenty one.
L:  Oh, boy, that is a big gap.
R:  Yeah.  So, um, but ...  Oh, I'm sorry.  My stepson is correcting me.  He'll be sixteen in September.
L:  Oh.  I'm sorry!  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's a big deal.  Within three months he will be sixteen.  [LAUGH]  But they are -- I mean, especially the younger two stepchildren are so good with my girls, just ...
L:  Oh, that's so good.
R:  I mean -- as a matter of fact I mean ...
L:  And that had to be important for you too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's, um -- they're really good.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  You can hear my five year old laughing next now probably.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] What are you laughing about Sally?  Oh, she's not laughing.
L:  Oh.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  You were completely mistaken.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But [NOISE] ...  I'm surprised they gave us ten minutes to talk about the most important thing to look for in a life partner.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems like that would be ...
L:  Well, everybody I'm sure has very specific ideas about that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't think it's something you'd probably have to ponder too much, you know?  [COUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I'm sure everybody really has their things and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- probably for the most part shouldn't be willing to compromise on those two very much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I would think.
R:  Yeah.  You know, it's funny, I went to a class reunion not too --
