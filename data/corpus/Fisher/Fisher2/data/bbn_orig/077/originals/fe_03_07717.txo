L:  Hi -- 
R:  Hello.
L:  -- I'm Adam.
R:  I'm Alexis.
L:  [MN] Ah -- 
R:  Hello.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Nice to meet you.  Um, [MN] I think that the most important thing in life partners is, ah, compatibility in as many areas as possible.
R:  I would agree with that but I think communication.
L:  Well, wouldn't you say that's part -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- of compatibility?
R:  Um, I think it could be but [NOISE] if you aren't -- if -- even if you aren't compatible, even if you don't enjoy all of the same things or have all of the same interests, you can still get along well as long as you communicate with each other.
L:  [MN] But, what if, ah, in your communication you realise that you're not compatible in -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- certain key areas?
R:  I think that would probably happen [NOISE] pretty early on.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  That's probably true.
R:  [NOISE] Sorry, my youngest just woke up.
L:  Oh, no problem.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Um, [MN] let me think.
R:  How many relationships have you been?
L:  Ah, thirty.
R:  Okay.  I've been married twice so I have kind of a whole skewed vision of it all.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
L:  Really, um, um, what caused those -- ah, that one that ended to end?
R:  Bad choices.  [LAUGH] --
L:  Was that --
R:  I made -- 
L:  -- communication?
R:  -- I made -- [NOISE] I made bad choices the first time.  I never should've gotten involved.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  Oh -- 
R:  So -- 
L:  -- but, was it a communication problem?
R:  No.  Ahah.
L:  Okay -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- so then why do you think communication's the most important thing?
R:  [MN] Um, because -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- I see too many people not working hard enough when I think they probably could save [NOISE] things and they get worse.  [NOISE] But, they get -- I think people give up too soon, too early.  What happened in my situation was [NOISE] irreconcilable.  There was no way it ever would have gotten better.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  But, I see other, [NOISE] you know -- what Hannah?  [NOISE] I see other people my age who a- a- you know, they just -- they give up too easy.  The whole instant gratification thing -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and it's got to be this way or that and that's not how it is.
L:  I see.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  My parents have been married for twenty five years and they've been through, I don't know how many battles and -- but they always work it out because they don't just throw in the towel.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] Oh, that's very interesting.  What do you think the people need to communicate about?
R:  Everything.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  [MN] People -- there are -- my -- my belief on it is that -- sorry, I'm just getting over bronchitis so -- 
L:  Oh, that's all right.
R:  -- it's kind of hard to talk but, um, I've always kind of felt people have a political correctness issue problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're too afraid to touch certain areas because they might offend someone.  Well -- 
L:  Yeah, but not -- 
R:  -- you know -- 
L:  -- when you're in a relationship.
R:  Oh, no.  I think people do in a relationship too.  They're afraid that they're going to say something wrong and the other person will take it the wrong way and walk out.
L:  Even when they're first dating though, once you're involved -- 
R:  No. 
L:  -- with someone for a while, I think that -- 
R:  N.
L:  -- the walls come down on that.
R:  I think it's still there a little bit.  But -- 
L:  'Cause that's why, you know, people argue --
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  -- about things and discuss things 'cause if you don't do that you're not really in a relationship.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  [NOISE] -- I guess it depends on what a person's view of a relationship is, um, yeah.
L:  Well, what's your definition of a relationship?
R:  Oh, boy, that's a loaded question.  Uh-hum, [NOISE] --  
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- people who are seeking somewhat the same thing in life and are working together to try and achieve it with each other.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE] So, at what point do you think that -- that, ah, people can stop trying to be politically correct or should stop trying to be politically correct?
R:  From the very beginning.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  I see.
R:  I don't think you should ever try to be [NOISE] politic- -- I hate being -- I hate the [NOISE] whole term.  The phrase to me bothers me.  You -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- should just say what it is you think.  [NOISE] Let it out on the table.  To me --  
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- people are worried about what others [NOISE] are going to think.  Ah, there you go sweetie.  Right there.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  I see.  So, the first time you would ever meet someone you would just lay it all out?
R:  Yeah, I usually do, now.  I didn't use to. 
L:  So, has that caused you any problems in the past?  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah, I was, um, too concerned of what other people would think instead of [NOISE] being more concerned that they knew who I really was -- 
L:  I see.
R:  -- or [NOISE] started to learn who I was.  [NOISE] -- 
L:  I see.  So, has, ah, being up front caused you any problems?
R:  Sometimes.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] Sometimes people are put off by it and think that it's, um -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- intimidating.
L:  I see.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  But, I don't think so at all and I admire that trait in other people as well.
L:  I see.
R:  And you?
L:  Ah, I try to be as up front as possible.  I think it's important as well.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, ah, I think that when you first meet someone it's very difficult to be up front with them about everything.  Like, you can't -- 
R:  Well -- 
L:  -- in your first meeting with someone, or your first several meetings, you can't get to know someone completely if you're at odds with them the whole time or telling them -- 
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, you don't want to go into it looking like, you know, here's -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- I don't know, probably [NOISE] a poor analogy but, "Here's all of my armor.  I have it on but I'm going to just show you --"
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  "-- little glimpses of what's inside".
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  You can't -- you can't face it with that view but you also don't want to be so closed in your shell that they can't see who you are.
L:  [MN] Yeah, that's true.
R:  Because how are they e- ever going to see what it is that is going to interest 'em?
L:  [MN] That's true.  [NOISE] Ah, but back to compatibility -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is the other thing that you, ah -- you would agree that that is important though?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  I mean -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you -- you've got to have some things in common.  I mean, 'cause if you didn't, you know -- 
L:  What do you think are the, ah, essential things that you need to have in common?
R:  Um, [NOISE] I think that probably, ah, a major thing would be [SIGH] -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- I don't know really how to put [NOISE] it but some people have more of a desirer [NOISE] for knowledge than others do.  Some people are fine, ah, with just, you know, [NOISE] -- oh, how do I put it without sounding egotistical?
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, [NOISE] just that some people prefer to just kind of go on through life and pick up what they get and others directly seek it.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think that that [NOISE] needs to be compatible. 
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  It doesn't -- [SIGH] [NOISE] I think that can cause a lot of -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- friction if a person has, um -- [NOISE] if you seek out someone else it's -- I think it's more [NOISE] like the whole mentor relationship idea, you know?  Trying to find somebody who can guide [NOISE] you and that's not -- you have to have an +equality -- 
L:  Okay.
R:  -- to it.  You can't -- I don't know if I'm making myself clear enough.  I know what it is I want to say but -- 
L:  Yeah, I understand what you're saying.  Okay.  
R:  [NOISE] -- 
L:  So you think that, ah, someone who yearns to be educated who, for instance, maybe reads a lot, couldn't be with someone who just likes to watch TV all day. 
R:  Well, no, I'm not saying that situation.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I'm saying somebody who -- 'cause I -- I used to read a ton and -- well, actually, that's not a good example because he [NOISE] -- that didn't work out but -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- um, [LAUGH] I think that a person who reads a lot can get along fine with somebody who watches TV all day but [SIGH] what I'm saying is, somebody who directly goes out -- goes to college, spends a lot of time, um, going to museums and doing things like that, isn't going to get along so well with somebody who is, um, not so interested in those things.  Someone who wants to just, you know, pick up what they get off of the news or, you know, they're like, "Oh, I went to high school.  That's good enough for me".  You know, that kind of outlook.
L:  All right.
R:  Somebody who's not actively out to seek more knowledge.
L:  All right.  That makes sense.  Now, here's something a little bit, ah, slightly less in depth would be just to share interests in the same leisure activities.
R:  I see -- 
L:  Which -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That would be essential in my opinion if you, ah -- 
R:  Somebody who likes the same kind of music or likes -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- to go see movies.  Goes dancing.
L:  Or whatever -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you like to do.  Like -- 
R:  I agree 'cause if you can't share your leisure time with each other because you like different things, what do you -- 
L:  I'd say that would -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- actually be the key component.
R:  Oh, I think you're right there.  Yeah, that does have a huge -- it has a huge amount to deal with that just, you know, you really -- I think you shouldn't work with somebody that you have a relationship with.  [MN] I think that complicates things and so [LAUGH] when you get off work what would you do, you know? 
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, it mightn't be a good idea to have a, ah, relationship with someone you work with anyway.  So -- 
R:  Ah, yeah, I always -- I -- I know a couple of people who have actually made it work and it --
