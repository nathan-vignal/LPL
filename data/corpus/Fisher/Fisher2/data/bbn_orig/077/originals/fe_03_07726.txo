R:  Hello.  My name's Clarke from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.
L:  Hi, mine's just Christine from New York. [NOISE] -- 
R:  New York city.
L:  Yes.
R:  And baby in arms, yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Hello baby in arms.  The minimum wage.  And you're the first, ah, female I've talked to [several inaudible words] I did wonder if we're talking about idioms or well, how -- how we talk to people and wh- what we ask and so forth.  But, I don't know.  It's not my --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- business what the study's about.  Is it important?  Kind of a boring subject really.  Ah [LAUGH] -- ah, for me anyway.
L:  True.  Me --
R:  Um -- 
L:  -- too.  Do you think it's fair?
R:  Mm?
L:  The -- 
R:  Is it fair?  [MN] I -- I think it's just a political football.  I -- I think it doesn't matter where it goes.  Ah, I -- I think it floats all the boats, ah, so, yes for people who are on the bottom of the scale, they're happy but I think it's a fool's paradise.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  I don't think it's -- 
L:  So, what -- 
R:  -- that it makes much difference whether they get, ah, five dollars an hour, five fifteen or five dollars or four eighty seven.  That does --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- to them, of course, ah, on paper --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, ah -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- what effect does it really have on your buying power and all that stuff and -- and just like Bush saying how much he's going to cut our taxes and we're going to be so happy with that.  The person that really benefits is the -- the entrepreneurs in those people that create businesses, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  Right?
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, money's important but, you know, it's economics and like, well -- well I -- I'm fifty five years old.  I was, ah, [MN] I'm a jazz musician.  You know, I've struggled my whole life but I've followed my heart.  But, back when I was just got out of high school I worked for t- two dollars an hour which was --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- minimum wage in nineteen sixty six.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, [MN] I was happy with that.  I [LAUGH] went out -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- had a car, went to, you know, had fun, you know?
L:  I think it's fine for -- especially kids out of high school.  But, if you have a family it's, you know -- 
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- harder to -- 
R:  Sure.
L:  -- try and survive -- 
R:  I've had a -- 
L:  -- on something like that.
R:  Yeah, I've had a family for thirty five years so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I know that too.
L:  Right.
R:  And to be a musician it's just not easy just to -- you have to have something else to make money even though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what I -- who -- when someone asks me who I am or what I do I always say that even though that's not how I make the majority of my money.
L:  Right.
R:  You just can't survive.
L:  [NOISE] No, you can't.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  You know, and, ah -- 
L:  No.  And I think at this stage if my kids had to, ah, make that -- that --
R:  W- -- 
L:  -- [several inaudible words] it wouldn't be a problem for me.
R:  What's that?
L:  If my kids made that.
R:  Oh.
L:  That wouldn't be a problem.  I wouldn't be appalled, like, "Oh, how could they pay such a little --" 
R:  Y- -- 
L:  "-- amount".
R:  -- yeah, work's good.  You know, working -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- working for a dollar or whatever is good but, you know, ah, we could talk about the, ah -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- wonder of, you know, capitalism --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and what -- what -- 
L:  Right.  [NOISE] --  
R:  -- def- defects are but they want to talk -- want us to talk about minimum wage. 
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  Then we have to stay on the subject or we don't get paid.
L:  True.
R:  So, you know, I, ah, [SIGH] it's a greedy system.
L:  Yes.
R:  It has defects but I guess --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's one of the -- it's all we've got.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know, what are you going to do?  You have to swim with the rest of the people.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Ah, we don't know our neighbor's names.  We [LAUGH] -- we all have pets.  Ah -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- New York city has more pets, I think, than any --
L:  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  -- other city.  I've just come back from there.  Ah -- 
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and I perform there all the time and, ah, but, ah, even with the strike it was difficult.  Is the strike still on?  I don't know.  I just had some problems with the strike, ah, coming -- 
L:  In Manhattan?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought it was over.  I -- 
R:  Yes.  Yeah. 
L:  -- could be wrong.  But, I'm -- I'm in Long Island and -- 
R:  Yeah, I do private parties.  My brother went to Kings Point there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's a part of Long Island, yeah.
L:  Kings Point.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a merchant marine academy.
L:  Okay, yes, so, [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Yeah.  It has been, ah, see, ah, two dollars an hour I guess would be equivalent to, like, [SIGH] four times that now.  So, minimum wage really hasn't, ah, gone -- 
L:  No, it hasn't climbed much.
R:  -- gone up that much --
L:  No.
R:  -- relative to the --
L:  Exactly.  Right.  Right.
R:  -- economy.  So, maybe I should be already thinking that way, you know, rather than thinking about those people who are on the bottom of -- 
L:  True.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- of the scale.  You know, it's -- they should be making eight dollars rather than five --
L:  Eight -- exactly.  Right. 
R:  -- dollars but, you know?  
L:  Exactly.
R:  And -- and -- and my --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- wife in nineteen seventy three we lived in Allentown.  She worked at a gro- -- I ran a retail store and she -- she, ah, I performed on the side, you know?  And she had a, ah -- cashier in a grocery store.  She made twelve dollars an hour in nineteen --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- seventy three.  That's equivalent to making, like, thirty five dollars an hour now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or more.  Three and a half times.  I don't know what the multiplier is.  I used to use all kind of indicators of what -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know -- I mean, what a man's suit costs, what rent you pay and on various -- of course it -- ti- time plays condition whether you're in New York or Pittsburg, it's a big difference --
L:  Right.
R:  -- relative to rent and housing costs and so forth.  But, that's a big difference.  
L:  It is.  I don't even know do they make as much nowadays?
R:  Oh.
L:  The wages?  I know they go a lot on tips.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  They rely mostly on their tips.  [NOISE]  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But -- 
R:  And your -- your child's going to be -- g- grow up and, ah, will have to work the jobs for minimum wage maybe [LAUGH] before they -- when they go to college or whatever.
L:  [NOISE] Sure.
R:  You know, and that's okay, you know, but, ah, I don't know, I think it's a -- 
L:  I don't know.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- you know --  
L:  I -- I -- I find -- I would find it totally hard to survive on something like that.
R:  Huh?
L:  Um, I would find it hard to try and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- survive on something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Well, in New York city you ca- -- 
L:  Oh, yeah, it's -- 
R:  -- ah, the minimum wage, I don't think anybody would work for five dollars an hour.  They couldn't work for five --
L:  Oh -- 
R:  -- dollars an hour.  It'd be better to stay and pick up cans.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly.
R:  In New York?  I mean, come on, yeah, I don't think people come out of their door for under -- 
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- what? 
L:  But, I guess, you know, that they're forcing them to go and to -- to find these minimum wage jobs by cutting their welfare -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] as they once used to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and then they -- ah, you're better off, ah, scratching and they wonder why people are hustling for a --
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  -- living, that's why they're hustling for a living.
L:  Yes.
R:  They can't survive on [MN] --
L:  Right, 'cause you do -- 
R:  -- it's ridiculous.
L:  -- long hours and you know, then you have to deal with babysitting and -- 
R:  And you're exploited.
L:  Yes.
R:  Let's face it.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And treated, you know, like as if you're worth nothing.
R:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
L:  The bottom of the barrel.
R:  That's the fall out of capitalism, I'm afraid.
L:  Yes, the bottom line.
R:  It [several inaudible words] just the stock market itself is like a big gambling casino which -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, but that's the system we're -- we're in, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And [MN] you know, say, for instance, I spend my life -- I -- I sleep 'til eleven o'clock and I -- I play to two and three A.M.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not very healthy with all that breathing in all that smoke and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I like it.  It's my art.
L:  Right.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  But, then -- 
L:  If you don't like what you're doing it's like, what's the sense?
R:  Yeah.  So, during the day --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- I do things -- I did this because someone said, "Hey, you make thirty bucks in three" [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it's better than the minimum wage, isn't it?
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, ah, ten dollars for a -- for ten minutes.
L:  Oh, yeah, [NOISE] I know, but it's only, what, five times you're allowed to do it.  [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
R:  How many times?
L:  [NOISE] Five.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  They told me three.  You're allowed to go five, huh?
L:  [NOISE] I -- I heard five.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE] I heard five.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Well -- well, that's cool.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] [NOISE] -- 
R:  I'll have -- I'll have to call -- I'll have -- have to call a couple more times then.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, um -- 
L:  Oh, you have to make the call.  [NOISE] I thought this call just comes to you.
R:  We only have a couple more minutes, I think, for this minimum wage talk.  What else can we talk about minimum wage?  Did -- 
L:  I know.  I know.  I know.
R:  -- did you ever make minimum wage?  Did you alw- always live --
L:  I did.
R:  -- in New York?
L:  I did.  I did make minimum wage.  I worked at, um, [inaudible] -- 
R:  You're not from New York.
L:  Yeah.  I'm from New York.
R:  You don't have a New York accent.
L:  [LAUGH] No.  My fam- -- 
R:  What hap- -- 
L:  My family's, like, originally from [inaudible].
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [inaudible] so -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  There's some, you know, from the islands mixed in there. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I did to some extent.  I worked, um, when I was a teenager minimum wage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And once I turned nineteen and twenty I went on to work with the bank and things like that and then -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- now I'm a registered nurse.  So, minimum wage is -- 
R:  Oh, a registered nurse, yeah.  Fantastic.
L:  -- out of the question.  [LAUGH] 
R:  So, you have a caring job then.
L:  Right.  Yeah, [NOISE] that's -- 
R:  Yeah, that's -- 
L:  -- what I do.
R:  Yeah, a registered nurse is rough.
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  A v- very few nurses are very old that work in the hospital system.  They're usually for [inaudible] people or something.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I [NOISE] --  
R:  They -- 
L:  -- I mean, I [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- they have some old people where you're working?
L:  I've seen one or two.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  Yeah?
L:  I've seen one [NOISE] -- 
R:  That's about it.  The rest of them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have bad backs don't they?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  That's exactly what it is and you know, they'd like to keep working but -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after a while it takes a toll 'cause there's a lot of, um, walking around.
R:  And, ah -- and -- and -- and a lot of hours.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A lot of hours --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- and, ah, you listen to a lot of complaints and they're piling a lot on the nurse's backs and the doctors --
L:  Right.
R:  -- come in and scribble things and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- the nurses run everything really.
L:  Yes.  Those eight hours -- 
R:  But -- 
L:  -- that is kind of -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- disappearing.  They're moving towards twelve hours on almost all units.
R:  And bankers are being -- in a bank -- like you say, working in a bank's an exploitive -- ah, they exploit you, um, you really.  They don't much money.
L:  No.
R:  It's, I think, sometimes worse than minimum wage and yet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they can get away with it.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] -- 
R:  And they have all this responsibility for what?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  It's like you said, it's exploitive.
R:  -- is minimum wage fair?  Well, I don't know.  I just -- I think it's way below what it should be but -- 
L:  It's just -- right.
R:  -- and, ah -- 
L:  I think so.
R:  -- and g- given what I just --
L:  I -- 
R:  -- thought about it, we'd be getting paid two dollars an hour in sixty six, three and a half times that --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- is a lot more than five fifteen now.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, if that's the multiplier you use.  I know it is for nineteen seventy, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  It depends who's looking at it I guess.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what scale -- 
R:  And if you're on the bottom of the scale everybody wants money, ah -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, um, are -- when I -- ah, economically speaking are you really being able to buy the same amount of -- 
L:  Right. [several inaudible words] not at all.
R:  -- you know -- ah, it changes everybody's salary.  If the minimum wage goes up it -- it has an inflationary effect on the economy I would think.
L:  I would think so, yes.
R:  Yeah.  Well -- 
L:  And they sure wouldn't want that.
R:  -- but nurses -- nurses get paid pretty well.  I have --  
L:  Yeah, we do, we do.  It -- it -- it depends on the state, um -- 
R:  But, you work hard.  You earn it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  New York you do make a pretty penny compared to some of the other states.
R:  Mm.  Mhm.
L:  When you take -- 
R:  And our per[?] -- our friends are per day[?] nurses in San Francisco that -- that, ah, get paid per day and housing costs and everything.  They're making a fortune, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A couple that live together they get fifteen hundred dollars a month per day -- for --for the month and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- plus they get five thousand dollars a month each.
L:  That's the thing you have to look at, that minimum wage is just a stepping stone.  You cannot -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stay there.  You -- 
R:  Yeah, I just -- 
L:  -- have to find other means [LAUGH] of, you know, in -- 
R:  'Cause even though -- 
L:  -- terms of -- 
R:  -- it's a fragile stone, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, it is.  Um [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] If a stone at all, ah, it -- quick sand maybe.  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you just -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- use minimum wage to stay a- afloat.  You got to -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- find another means.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, my, um --
