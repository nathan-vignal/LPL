R:  Hi, my name is Amy.  [PAUSE]  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Roberta.
R:  Hi.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  Um, in a life partner I'm looking for someone that would share the same values as me and, um, work together with me and be a fifty fifty partner.
L:  That's -- that's real good.  I have a life partner and he and I are best friends.  We have the same interests.  Um, sometimes my kids think I do too much for him, but I have found that when you do something for someone who loves you they do something back and we have a very good relationship that way.
R:  That sounds wonderful.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I had thought I had found [LAUGH] the right one and we were together for about fifteen years and it just got to the point where he expected me to do everything and it wasn't the kind of relationship you had it seems like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I became being felt that I was used and, uh, after so many years I just couldn't go on with it.  I needed to find someone that really did care.
L:  Mhm.  I was alone for fifteen years and he and I had gone to school together and ran into each after he had, uh, split up with his wife and we just -- it was love from [LAUGH] the very first.
R:  Way back when.  [LAUGH]
L:  Love from the very first.  We had known each other for years, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, it's been wonderful.
R:  That's fun- -- that's funny.  On the Today Show there -- as I get ready for work in the morning I have that on and they're doing the marriage --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- where the audience picks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and one of the couples on there used to be boyfriend and girlfriend like in high school, the cheerleader, football player, and they both went to separate colleges --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it just didn't work out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then they met at their reunion and now they're getting married.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I thought that was really cool.
L:  Yeah.  We have a very good relationship.  Um, when we got married we thought it was gonna be horrid because he had two boys and I had three girls.
R:  Mm.
L:  My kids were all grown --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and -- but we came from -- I have three generation females in my family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he has three generations of boys.  But we have both adapted and it's been very interesting.  We have ...
R:  How long have you guys been married?
L:  Eleven years next week.
R:  Oh, congratulations.  Happy anniversary.
L:  Thank you.  Yeah.  It's -- it's been great and, uh, I'd marry him again in a heartbeat.  I think every year we get closer together.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yep.
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm, uh, dating I should say somebody that I went out with for about eight or nine years when I lived out of state --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he ended up moving and then we broke up and went our separate ways and he's back here, I guess about four or five hours away, and --
L:  Oh, that's ...
R:  -- and -- and so we're -- we're taking it slow and seeing what's happening.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, you know, at this point in time 'cause when we're together it's like we've never been apart --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I, you know, work two jobs and I go and I come and I still like that, I don't wanna lose that right now, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  I understand that.  Yeah.
R:  You know?  I had lost it for a while and I said no, I'm not gonna lose it again.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we're looking forward to, um, when he can retire in about ten years we can be together all the time --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and we're very lucky because so many couples when they get -- you know, the kids are gone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody's -- you know, it's like what are we gonna do?
R:  Right.
L:  And he and I we have woodworking and photography and we just like to do everything together.  So ...
R:  Oh, that's wonderful.
L:  Mhm.  So, we have a great time and [SIGH] I think it's just gonna get better.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Good luck.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I hope you find someone like that too.
R:  Thanks.  Yeah.  Me too.  In fact, uh, even though I am kind of seeing Dave, I mean, we've made no commitment or anything to each other, uh, I'm gonna go on a blind date I think next weekend.  I think I'll -- he's called a couple of times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's like the lady across the street has -- knows the mother and blah, blah, blah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hate blind dates, but you know what?  I'll give it a shot.  You never know.
L:  That's true.  You never know.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  And I had gotten to the point where I hadn't -- hadn't even dated in a year and a half and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was just unbelievable.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I ...
L:  You just never know.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And when you're least expecting it that might be the one.
R:  That would be nice.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I hope it happens for you.
R:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  There's so much violence in the world --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- between couples nowadays and --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and it's just horrific --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, to hear somebody that has a happy marriage is wonderful.  I ...
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  You know?
L:  We're lucky.  We know that.  We -- our neighbor, uh, just lost her husband and ...
R:  Mm.  I'm sorry. 
L:  Yeah.  Uh, he was fifty years old.
R:  Oh, wow!  Young.
L:  He died of cancer and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I think -- like my husband said -- we tell each other every day how much we love each other --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so many couples are just, you know, you're in, you're out, and it's just there's nothing there.  You forget -- you forget --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to say how much you care because -- like his couple he was not affectionate.  He was not -- you know, nothing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they'd been married about thirteen years and the last two months while he was here at home before he died he said, "If I could only go back".  He said, "And I could hold you and kiss you and -- and tell you how much you mean to me" because when they were married he never did, you know, and it took him on his deathbed before he realized --
R:  He realized.  Yeah.
L:  -- what he had.
R:  That's like, uh -- I -- I don't know if you listen to music, but Luther Vanjos[?] has a new album out and one of the songs on his album is, um, you know, the guy basically just does what he does --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, his wife is there, she doesn't ask for much and it says like if you would only bring me a rose --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- if you would only call me from work to say hi.
L:  Yes.  Oh, I love that song.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You know?  And it's -- it's true, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  It's true.
L:  It is.  It's very true.
R:  We don't need the whole bunch.  One means more.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's what my husband does.  Every once in a while I'll get up -- he works third shift -- and he'll get up on his way home from work and buy me flowers.
R:  Oh, how sweet.
L:  I get up and -- and find them.  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  He's quite a boy.  [MN]
R:  Very sweet.
L:  Yeah.  Well, this is the first time I've been on one of these.
R:  This is my second time.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yes.  And what happens is in like another minute or two -- I -- I didn't realize what time we started -- they say, "Okay.  Time is up.  You have thirty seconds to say goodbye".
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, we just keep talking until they stop us.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  The first one I had to do was on bio -- bio terrorism.
L:  Okay.
R:  But that one was a bit more challenging.
L:  Yes.  I can imagine.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  That would be interesting though.
R:  Yeah.  So, that -- that was -- that was interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it was, but ...
L:  How old are you?
R:  I'm forty five.
L:  Oh, I'm fifty seven.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mm.
R:  Not far.  Not far apart.
L:  No.  Uh-uh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I live in the State of Florida.
L:  I'm in Ohio.
R:  Is it still cold up there?
L:  Um, no.  Thank goodness.  Today was pretty nice.  It got chilly, um, uh, when the sun went down.  It's down in probably the low sixties right now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But we've had -- we've had a terrible year.
R:  Yes, you guys have --
L:  Uh ...
R:  -- and I'm a New Yorker that's transplanted down here and I saw how much my brothers and sisters got in New York and I said, "Thank God I'm not up there" 'cause my blood has been, you know ...?
L:  Thin?
R:  Yeah.  I -- really it's like I can't handle the cold.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that was one of the reasons that I left my love because I told him, you know, "You're just treating me wrong and I'm leaving" --
L:  Well, good for you.
R:  -- and he -- the day the moving van came and took my stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the apartment was emptied he kept saying, "You're not leaving me.  You're not leaving me" --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and I kept saying, "Uh, excuse me.  There's nothing here".
L:  Yeah.
R:  What he thought -- years later he told me was he thought I rented a U. -- a van, a moving van, like North America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they loaded the furniture and they were gonna just hold it for a day and then bring it back.
L:  Oh, he really thought that?
R:  I said, "You know?  You're thinking with I don't know what".
L:  Totally screwed.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  That's too bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And has he tried to get you back?
R:  He actually is in the process of trying to get me back now.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's been -- I've been through another rel- -- I've been down here twelve years and, uh --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- I went through, um, another relationship for seven years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that guy was with me when I had breast cancer.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  So, that's real -- you know, I thought okay, this is it, I'm sick, he's just gonna take off.  But no, he was there through it and really into it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which was cool and then --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- two years ago he just decided that, uh, he was going through a midlife crisis and, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- took off for California --
L:  Uh, unreal.
R:  -- and like, you know, road off into the wind.
L:  That's so sad.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
