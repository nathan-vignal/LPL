R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's Nick.
L:  My name's Michelle.
R:  Hey [SIGH].
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Uh, Minneapolis.
L:  Minneapolis.  I'm from, uh, Orange County, California.
R:  Oh [MN].
L:  Uh, Minneapolis is where you grew up?
R:  No, Iowa, actually [LAUGH].
L:  Iowa?
R:  A lot of people from, uh, from here are not from here [LAUGH].  Everyone moves to Minneapolis [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, everyone moves to California as well.  So, the topic, I guess, is what?  Minimum wage?
R:  That's not what I heard.  I heard it was, uh, comedy, what is acceptable and what is not.  Well --
L:  Oh, you're kidding me?  They gave y- -- oh, we have wrong topics.
R:  They crossed wires [LAUGH].
L:  That's okay.  Um, I have a -- comedy --
R:  What's funny about the minimum wage? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That's it, yeah.  They said something about --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- five dollars and something being sufficient minimum wage.  And I'm wondering -- I guess we could talk about that.  I'm wondering what is minimum wage in Iowa? [NOISE]  Or in Minneapolis, I'm sorry.
R:  Phew, well, let's see here.  Um, both Minnesota and, uh, Iowa have, uh, a higher minimum wage than the national [MN].  I -- I don't know exactly what it is [SIGH].  Not a whole lot higher, it's like five something.
L:  Really?  So --
R:  Isn't national like four eight five [SIGH]?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I'm not sure what national is, but here in California, um, I know in Orange County it's, like, six dollars and in some places as much as maybe six seventy five [SIGH].
R:  Oh, that's good.  
L:  Yeah, it's -- I guess that's --
R:  Is that -- is that like a local municipality thing?
L:  [SIGH] I think it varies from city to city.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  However, [SIGH] I still -- I mean -- I -- 
R:  It's still not a living wage [LAUGH].
L:  It's not -- [MN] the question I think they want us to discuss is, um, whether it's sufficient or not, and I don't know, I --
R:  Whether it's sufficient?
L:  Yeah, you know, for --
R:  Oh, absolutely not [LAUGH].
L:  -- cost of living, yeah.
R:  I mean, it's --
L:  I don't think I even know anybody that really can live on minimum wage.  Do you?
R:  No, uh, no.  I mean, no [MN] -- not unless some part of their expenses is free, like kid living with mom and dad or something [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, if it was a -- if you're only getting minimum wage [SIGH] certainly you're having to get other kinds of assistance as well.
R:  Yeah.  Well, here in Minneapolis, um, somewhere between forty or fifty [SIGH] of all homeless people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have jobs.  They work.
L:  Yeah, that's what I understand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's what I've read too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not -- it's not because they're not working --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [NOISE] just that their --
R:  Right.
L:  -- jobs don't pay ...
R:  They -- they have jobs, and they also frequently have mental problems [LAUGH].
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know.
L:  And --
R:  Not -- not necessarily substance abuse problems.  Sometimes, sometimes not.
L:  [MN] Really?  The people that are just working on minimum wage and [NOISE] with a partial assistance, they're barely even scraping by.
R:  Right.
L:  That's what I notice here in California.
R:  Yeah, that's exactly what it is here too.  They're barely getting by.  Minnesota does have a lot of programs though [SIGH] that -- with recent budget cuts, it's been [SIGH] --
L:  Do you know [MN] --
R:  -- it's been tough [SIGH].
L:  Uh, do you know a lot of people that get assistance with those programs?  I mean --
R:  I don't know a lot of people, but I used to work at a grocery store [SIGH] and, uh, [SIGH] the -- I mean there are thousands and thousands and thousands who get assistance.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, even -- [MN] Minnesota has several health insurance plans, and I think, like, between ten and twenty per cent of, um, of all Minnesotans are on a government subsidized plan [SIGH].  Minnesota has one of the best healthcare, um, tr- tr- -- you know, histories and traditions [SIGH].
L:  Right.
R:  As -- I mean as far as wanting everyone to be covered and [LAUGH] ...
L:  California's pretty good.  It seems like it varies, though, from county to county.  When I was living --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when I was living in Los Angeles [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I actually needed assistance at one time.
R:  Sure.
L:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] I was able to get it right away.  I mean, within the next day they had a place for me to stay, they had several numbers where I could get healthcare [SIGH] and then when I moved to Orange County [SIGH] it was a totally different story.  Took me a long time to get any type of assistance at all.  I was on -- put on all kinds of waiting lists and --
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, so it really -- it really varies, I think.
R:  That's odd.  I think Minnesota's more just everything's the same in Minnesota --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- period.  You know, there's -- there's too many counties here.  One in the Minneapolis County, and the other one's the Saint Paul County, and they each have their suburbs.  [SIGH] Um --
L:  [MN] So, yeah, the que- -- the answer is definitely not sufficient [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, definitely.  I mean, you just look at cost of living increases, inflation, [SIGH], everything -- it's -- it's like [SIGH] adjusted for, I don't know, it's -- it's -- it's ridiculous.  It's like the minimum wage used to be, like, three dollars or four dollars or something, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, [MN] just nationwide, and back then, that -- that actually earned something, you know, that -- it wasn't -- maybe it was sufficient, maybe it wasn't sufficient, you know, but it -- it was significant, and then, since then, the dollar's worth half as much, prices of everything on -- on average have, you know, doubled basically.  Though, like, prices for rent have [MN] more than doubled [SIGH] and, uh, [SIGH] wow.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Another thing is, is that, um --
R:  So, it's not just that -- you know, it needs to keep up with the times.  And -- and it's -- it's been, like, ten, twenty years of Republican leadership -- Democrat leadership too, but Republican especially that says, "We don't wanna increase the minimum wage, 'cause then business will have to pay more", so --
L:  Right.  Um, another interesting thing -- talking about minimum wage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is I recently just went to c- court for a traffic violation that I had.
R:  Sure.
L:  Yeah, and, uh, it was a six hundred dollar fine.
R:  Yeah [SIGH].
L:  And at the time I was thinking, "Well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to come up with that much money within the stipulated time parameters", so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I decided, um, maybe I'd opt for community service [SIGH].
R:  Right.
L:  And so what they do is they [SIGH] give you X amount of hours, and I opted to either do community service hours -- and the way they calculate it is you do so many hours based on what minimum wage pays.  So, it ended up being, like, eighty something hours.
R:  [MN]
L:  And [SIGH], um, that's a lotta time [LAUGH].  And, so, actually --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I decided, you know what?  Eighty hours is a lot of time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I opted just to pay it.  But, um, based on minimum wage, [SIGH] I was thinking, kinda if it was based on what I was getting paid should be a lot less time.  So, it actually paid off for me just to pay it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than it was for me to try to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- spend eighty hours.  Eighty hours I could have made --
R:  I gotta say it, you know, I've -- that -- that is -- that is so true.  Um, and the cost of autos is immense [LAUGH], you know, environmentally and pollution and [SIGH] all these different things.  And just insurance and [SIGH] [LIPSMACK], you know, it's -- it's good to get a Honda Civic and [LAUGH] fix everything before it happens, and then nothing [LAUGH] -- and then, you know, that's what I get.  I -- it's a nineteen eighty nine [NOISE], paid for and -- I don't know, very little maintenance per year, you know?
L:  Really?  I just purchased a Toyota --
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  -- Cressida.  Yeah, a little economy car.
R:  Good.
L:  And here in California they've just, uh -- our governor out here, which has just increased all our D.M.V. fees [SIGH] --
R:  I'm fine with that [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] You're fine with that?
R:  It should cost more to drive, because it costs more for roads [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Oh, you -- you're for that, huh?
R:  [MN] I -- yeah, I'm for it -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm for it.  You know, have -- have fewer cars [SIGH].
L:  Hm.
R:  You know?  
L:  I don't know.  Out here in California you need a car.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's just hard, really, really hard to survive on public transportation.
R:  Yeah.  Well, here you kinda do too.  Public transportation sucks, but, you know, I wanna see more people biking or -- or whatever.
L:  That's true.
R:  And I -- I also wanna see a program where's if -- where if someone is not making enough money [MN] and they need a car to go to work [LIPSMACK], the government should pick up the tab, you know?
L:  I hear you.  'Cause it's almost --
R:  I -- I'd be completely comfortable --
L:  -- it's almost impossible.
R:  -- with that.
L:  Yeah.  They should do -- there should be more programs for them.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Because it's virtually impossible to try to really have a schedule.  I know that it -- when I'm depending on public transportation --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't care if I'm getting up two hours earlier, I cannot rely on the bus to get me there to work.
R:  Sure, sure.  [SIGH] I have another thing to say.  You should check out, like, food co-ops and just any sort of co-op, like a -- a credit union.  It's basically a bank that is owned by its members.  'Cause that's what co-ops are --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- owned by 'em, you know, and so all their money is gonna go back to members [MN] in the forms of savings, or it's going to go to employees for livable wage jobs.  There's a lot of employers --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that are committed to having livable wage jobs, [SIGH] you know?
L:  Right.  Food co-ops, huh?  That's interesting concept --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you ever -- 
R:  Natural -- 
L:  -- purchased --
R:  -- natural food co-ops.  No, not -- not, like, whole foods or [SIGH] -- or, um, one of those th- -- [MN] those aren't co-ops, [SIGH] those are investor owned, and so somebody's making a d- -- buck off of it, but --
L:  Huh.  How does someone find out about participating in a food co-op?
R:  Oh, you can look up online, just food co-op.  Um, they're all over, especially [MN] in California.  And Minnesota too.  Those are probably the two biggest states for them, California and Minnesota [LAUGH].
L:  That right?  
R:  They all over [LAUGH].
L:  [MN]
R:  And some of it's gonna be healthier food.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  And then I also joined a barter network.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, basically, um, like, I -- I can paint, and I can also drive people around in my car [MN].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, if they need a trip to the airport, they don't have to pay forty dollars for the cab fare [LAUGH].
L:  How do you do that?  That's really interesting.
R:  Yeah.  I just -- I found one.  I don't know --
