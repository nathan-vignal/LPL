L:  Hello, I'm Christine.
R:  Hello, I'm Barbara.
L:  Um, I'm sorry but I didn't hear what the minimum wage was --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- that they were discussing.
R:  Uh, they were talking about raising it to five dollars and fifteen cents.  And I think that must be the federal, uh, minimum wage because, uh, I'm in California and I think the minimum wage here is more than that right now.
L:  I moved from California to Florida.  I'm in Florida now.
R:  Oh you are?
L:  I moved from Santa Barbara three years ago.
R:  Oh for goodness sakes.
L:  And it is more -- the minimum wage in California is more money, state, whenever I left.
R:  That's -- oh, uh-huh.
L:  And Florida is like, five dollars and fifteen cents an hour.
R:  Oh you're kidding.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Gosh.
L:  No, it's -- it's very, very poor.  It's, um, Florida -- well, I'm in the Panhandle.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So many -- I -- but I live in a resort area.
R:  Oh.
L:  But there's still no money in this area.
R:  For heavens sake.
L:  And there's no, um, there's no corporations, many of the people are retired so they already have their benefits from their previous jobs.  Many are retired military.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So they have their benefits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's -- here in Florida it's an employer right state.
R:  Hm.
L:  Not an employee right state.
R:  Oh I see.  Well gosh, I don't know.  I -- I don't feel that five dollars and fifteen cents is high enough.
L:  Well, no, because you look for housing, any place in the country, and it's quite expensive.
R:  Oh yes.
L:  And then moving from Santa Barbara, I personally could not even make it on fifteen dollars an hour on my own in rented -- an apartment there in Santa Barbara.
R:  Oh, you know, Santa Barbara is just a gorgeous area, isn't it?
L:  Oh yes. [LAUGH]
R:  Do you -- do you miss it? [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  My house was ocean and island view, so yes I very much miss my lifestyle. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh gosh, I can imagine.
L:  But the +gulf here is gorgeous.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm in the panhandle.  And -- but --
R:  Do you have much trouble with tornadoes?
L:  Um, [SIGH] no because I'm on the gulf, that's more inland.
R:  Oh that's a little more protected?
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Right.  I'm between Pensacola and Panama City.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  I'm in Destin.  So --
R:  Well, I don't know, um ...
L:  But, uh, for, I mean, even for this being, you know, an area where the wages aren't much, and then also another thing too, even with minimum wage position they don't have to offer you benefits.
R:  Oh they don't?
L:  No.
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  Um, many places -- there's one girl that's been working where I'm working now, I owned my own business for two years whenever I came here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And finally I couldn't get benefits on my own so then I went to work at a business here because I could get benefits after three months.
R:  Oh.
L:  But that's only because they put me on as permanent full time employee and I worked for a major corporation.
R:  Oh I see.
L:  So anybody that's just a part time employee, they make one wage and that's it.
R:  Hm.
L:  Which is more than minimum but most places around here only pay minimum.
R:  Right.  Well I would think in your area probably, in fact in a lot of Florida, I would think mainly most of the jobs are service jobs.
L:  Correct.
R:  And of course that's gonna be quite low paying.
L:  Correct.  There's not any type of computer jobs, um, secretarial positions are like, five dollars an hour, five fifteen an hour or something like that.
R:  Oh, that's awful.
L:  And then they don't guarantee you thirty hours a week.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, you know, y- your car insurance, y- you have your living, just -- I mean, I bought a mobile home, a used mobile home to live on -- to live in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because of rent, so I could be able to afford to live.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I checked out -- I mean, even on a minimum wage you just can't make it, even on ten dollars an hour you can't make it.
R:  Oh no.
L:  And I mean, that's doing nothing, just supporting yourself, paying health insurance, just paying your, you know, basic cable you don't even get to get good cable, you know what I'm saying?  With everything.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's like, how can they even ex- -- I mean, when you're a single person then you would be forced to live with somebody.
R:  Right.
L:  To be able to meet your bills and I don't think that's right.
R:  I don't either.  I -- myself I've never had a roommate except for a husband.
L:  Right.
R:  But I don't [COUGH] -- I don't know, I -- I like my privacy and I like my space --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know.
L:  That's the way I am.
R:  Mm.
L:  I'm, you know, I like my privacy and I like my space and I don't want to have to depend on someone else.
R:  No.
L:  And it's not fair that you go into a position with experience, years of experience, and they start you out at the bottom of the total pole of minimum wage.
R:  No, that's definitely not right.  But you know, they'll do anything they can to hold that bottom line down.
L:  Right.  Now where in California do you live?
R:  I live in a small town called Anderson and it's about eight miles south of Redding, California.
L:  Redding.  So you're up north.
R:  Uh, very far north, yes.
L:  Right.
R:  And our, uh, our cost of living here is reasonably low, although it's going through a change, it is starting to go up.  And our real estate prices, and of course this also affects rentals, have just been soaring in the last two years.  So, uh, you know, and the wages are not high here either.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  So a young couple that wants to save and buy a house has a real challenge, you know.
L:  Right.  Even going inland the home prices -- I mean, I lived out in California from like, eight four until just three years ago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's like, I watched the home prices in the Lancaster area just, you know, sky rocket.
R:  Right.
L:  Because everybody was going out there to buy b- -- working in the city because they could make more money, because Lancaster was low payer then you had to go for a government position.
R:  Oh I see.
L:  And even government positions are very low pay.
R:  Mm -- oh, are they really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm kind of surprised to hear that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  Um, you can go in with college education and everything else and still just make ... a little bit above minimum.
R:  Yeah, that's just not right.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  I mean, you know, if you're a single person you can't make it, and imagine if you were like, a single mother or something.
L:  Right.  Now, in New Mexico -- I -- I'm almost fifty, but in New Mexico I was a single mother. [LIPSMACK]
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  But, I owned ten acres, I owned a mobile home, um, I had an excellent paying job.  And I worked for the go- -- I was a contr- -- I was a state employee contracted to the government.
R:  Oh I see.
L:  So I made double the minimum and then I put in, you know, like, sixty, eighty hours a week, so I had time and a half on top of that.
R:  Oh, that worked out pretty well.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right.
R:  Although it kept you awfully busy.  Huh!
L:  Yeah, it did.  Luckily I had my mom and dad to help me out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do that and advance so much at the time.  But when I was in California I really didn't work.
R:  Hm.
L:  I didn't have to.
R:  Oh, that must have been lovely.
L:  [MN]
R:  Especially in a place like Santa Barbara! [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  But now I'm self supporting [LAUGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and it's like, "Oh my!"  I think, should I go eat?  That's ten dollars.  I have to work two hours after taxes and we don't pay state, we only pay federal.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  You know, so you're -- you're trying to think, okay, or, you know, maybe an hour I have to work to be able to go eat out --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- once a week or whatever.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  That just doesn't sound fair.
L:  No, it doesn't but you can't -- entrance into a movie theater is more than minimum wage.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know?  If you stop and think of what you go do ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  And if five dollars an hour or five fifteen, whatever, minus your taxes, how long is it going to take you just to be able to get a tank of gas, that's not including your insurance and your maintenance.
R:  Oh right.  And, you know, uh
