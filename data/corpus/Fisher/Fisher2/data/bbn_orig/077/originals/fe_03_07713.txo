L:  Hello.
R:  My name is Roger.
L:  Hi, this is Marcie.
R:  Hiya.  How ya doing?
L:  Good.  [NOISE] I guess we have to talk about life partners.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yes, we do.
L:  Okay, [NOISE] um, life partner.  What they must think is -- probably I think the most important thing about a life partner is to be a friend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, somebody just start out as friends.  
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Um.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, I think that, uh, you can't as -- as far as, uh, partners go, or [MN] [MN] I believe too that, um, starting out as friends i- is essential.  You can't just jump into a relationship without even knowing the person.
L:  Right.
R:  It's, uh -- it's -- [MN] it's -- because along with friendship th- there's the -- there develops a trust and, uh, everything else that goes int- -- uh -- in that's involved with the relationship like that.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Because, uh, I think that if you start out with sex --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the beginning th- it doesn't really last.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It does not last at all.
L:  Exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, I think it's, uh, essential that over a period of time that, uh, as you get to know a person through friendship good, you get to know that person a lot b- better.  Yeah, as far as how to interact with them it, uh -- in -- in regards to what they think, how they feel and, uh, uh, and things like that.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I think sometimes you don't even know that it's gonna be your life partner.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think that --
R:  Sometimes it usually starts out with, uh --
L: Y- [NOISE] --
R:  -- [MN] quite opposite, you know?
L:  Ex- exactly, and you don't even realize -- I mean, it's exactly it.  That's how it was for me.  You don't even really realize --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that this is what you're looking for.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And all of a sudden it's there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I usually tell people when they're looking for a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, for a partner like not to look.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We say, "Stop looking.  You're looking too hard".
R:  Yeah.
L:  "If you're looking, I --"
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  "-- suggest, you know, go through, you know, your every day things and you're going to find somebody that you just get along with and it's just gonna happen".  And it's not really something you go out and --
R:  Yeah, there's --
L:  -- look for.
R:  -- kind of though something that you least expect.
L:  Exactly.  That's what I tell people.  I said, "You're looking --" you know, "Don't -- don't go out there and look so hard because it's -- it's -- it's just not how it happens".  I said, "Go" you know, "Engage yourself in activities that you like, join different clubs that you like".  I said, "It'll -- it will -- it like appears [LAUGH] when you're not looking".
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, because, uh, usually when you g- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- out there looking for something nothing happens.
L:  Right.
R:  And then --
L:  That's ex- ex- exactly it and then you get disappointed and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then you think it's not gonna happen and I think you become a person that I think it affects you actually finding somebody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because you come kind of a down --
R:  Yeah, yeah, g- gets a little depressing after a while when you're [MN] uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you're searching every -- every day and that -- that you're not finding what you want.
L:  Well, that's exact- -- that's exactly how it happened.  I was with somebody for a very long time [NOISE] and then we sorta like took a breather and there was my husband like when I [LAUGH] -- it was just -- it was like [NOISE] -- like fate.  It was just there.
R:  Mhm.  Like -- it's like kismet.  That's, uh -- that's the word.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.
R:  The, uh -- personally right now I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- haven't had, er -- I haven't been in a relationship for a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- long time and, uh --
L:  You have been or you haven't been?
R:  Mm?
L:  You have been?
R:  I haven't been.
L:  You haven't been?
R:  No.
L:  See, you gotta stop looking.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Yeah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- yeah.  But at -- I'm at a point right now where I'm, uh, just, er, f- [MN] er, f- feel that, uh, just if anything's gonna happen, it's gonna happen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, so don't, uh, ah, keep pining away every day thinking that, uh, uh, you gonna wake up one morning and run into the person that you always, uh -- always wanted, you know.  And --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that -- I feel that, uh, a reality check kind of, um, clicks in after a while and you j- just -- you have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- take things, uh, as they go one day at a time.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Right, and I think also like one of the things you need to do, um, is you have to be a pretty flexible person.  I think as far as a life partner goes, you have to be willing, um, to be flexible.
R:  You have to be c- have to compromise too.
L:  And to com- -- and to -- I mean and to compromise because I don't -- I truly don't think there's somebody out there that, you know, everything's perfect and you're not.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, you're exactly the same and you like to do everything exactly the same.  I think --
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know --
R:  I think that als- --
L: -- compromise and -- and -- is -- is really important.
R:  Yeah, yeah, also too you can't be, uh, c- uh, controlling because controlling i- i- is -- is a negative there as well because, er. when you get to be controlling that's, uh -- it -- it's like monopolizing a person's life, their time.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And they soon be- begin to resent that.  I've known people who have been in relationships where the one party was so dominating in the relationship, it drove the other person away.
L:  Mhm.  And I've actually have been in that position and that's how the -- the man I told you the first relationship that I was in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's exactly what the situation was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I actually drove the person, you know, away.  I don't know what ever could have been with it but -- and, you know, that -- that's it -- that was a big lesson --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for me.  Big, big lesson.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, no, I -- I tend to listen.  I tend to listen and observe things that happen around me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I -- I say to myself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's not gonna happen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me and I'm not gonna be that sort --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- of person towards anyone else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I -- I think that's also essential when it comes to relating to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a -- a- a -- a person, uh, or people in general, you know, because, er, er, um, people or not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everyone is -- is -- is alike and you have to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- look from -- look at it from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a perspective that, uh, [LIPSMACK] uh, that person is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- either going to like you or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're just gonna lose interest in you, you know.
L:  It makes me think and it's like I'm a big movie watcher.  It makes me think of, um ...  [NOISE] It was just a father and daughter but he -- she said in -- in the movie, Dirty Dancing, she said to her dad, "If you love me, you have to love everything about me.  All the things about me".
R:  Yeah. 
L:  "Even --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- the things that you may not agree with and --"
R:  Yeah and he had to not -- you -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also too you can't be judgemental towards everyb- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- er, towards that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- person as well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, because they're gonna do things that you're not gonna like and you're gonna things that they're not gonna really like.  But I think that when it comes to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- communication that's the essential aspect of a relationship as well because --
L:  Right, and I think --
R:  -- if you don't communicate it's not gonna -- it's not gonna work.
L:  Yeah, and I also think like finding a life partner, why -- why it's good not to be like going out there and looking and waiting because sometimes it's exactly opposite of what you thought.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [NOISE] like when I -- when I found my h- -- was with my husband, I never thought -- if somebody would have told me [NOISE] who he would have been, where he was from, how old he would've b- -- you know, what he -- what -- where, you know, what he has done growing up or whatever, [NOISE] I would just say, "Oh, no, no.  That's person's not for me".  That's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's exactly what I would have said.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] But, um, [NOISE] you know, so I think you just have to be, like we said before, extremely open minded --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and not -- you can't like write down a set of like a list --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of what it is you're looking for.
R:  No.  Because no one's gonna meet all those expectations you have written down on a list anyway.
L:  Right.
R:  Because everyone is flawed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in some way or another.
L:  [NOISE] [inaudible] You got that.  Everybody [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] Um, let's see what else about a life partner.  Um ...
R:  You also try to look for similar interests as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or sometimes like which would happen with me is that it almost like somebody who had different interests but things --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I thought, "Wow, that's really cool and I might like to do them".
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, [NOISE] um, the situation with me was that we were both so, so different but we taught each other --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so much about different things in life and about different activities.  He -- he did things and has done things in his life that he thought he would never do and I've done things, um, that I thought I would never do.  Um, and had experiences I thought I would never have but -- a- and if we talk -- you know, if we sit down and we look at it, we've both become so much m- -- you know, so much better people, more rounded --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people.  Much more accepting people.  [NOISE] Um, see we were both from [MN] [NOISE] way different parts [LAUGH] of the world.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And -- and -- and --
R:  And o- opposites do -- do -- do attract --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as well.
L:  [MN] [MN] That's true.  That's true.  I mean, we were different age.  We were everything and it just, um ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  As far as age is concerned --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me that's just nothing more than a chronological manifestation anyway.  I think it all depends on -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on how much you know and how old -- not necessarily like -- well, that, er -- th- th- it also depends on how mature you are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when it comes to relating to -- to one another and I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have to start out as friends essentially because, er, as, er, I've, um, m- mentioned before earlier in the conservation that, er, um, friendships always last, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Friendships last.  [MN] A true friend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is always gonna be there regardless, er, of good times and bad.  You know that.
L:  Right.  It was -- it's kind of weird though.  Because, like, um, we were talking about age.  [NOISE] It's much more accepted when a -- an o- -- like a [MN] -- the guy is older.  Let's say several years older.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's kinda -- it's kinda a strange situation that people get [LAUGH] in when it's the other way around.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now it doesn't mean anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, any more but that was a big issue that was out there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I found.
R:  Well that was, uh, one of those sociological mores, uh, way --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- back in the --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- fifties and sixties.  You know, that the -- the person had to be -- the man -- the male had to be older --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the female had to be several years or a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a year or several years younger --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [MN] in order to be compatible but that doesn't work any more.
L:  I found a big, uh [NOISE] -- big [LAUGH] issue with that.  Um, and like I said, years down the road it stops really meaning anything but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- it was a big, like you said, I guess like a social [NOISE] -- social more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- sort of but, um ...
R:  But that's one of those things you talk about in psych class --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the first year of, uh --
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, uh, college, uh, freshman, uh, one oh one.
L:  I remember that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What was it?  Mores and, uh, [NOISE] folk l- -- folk law--
