R:  Hi, this is --
L:  Hi, this is --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Uh, you go first.
R:  This is Marguerite.
L:  This is [inaudible].  Okay, um, distasteful comedy.  Let's see.  Comedy, I mean, it's -- some of it, it's funny but some of it -- I mean, I guess perverse is one of them.  You know, I mean, yes it's too perverse, you know.
R:  Yeah.  I think it depends on where you're at.  Like if you're at work, you know.
L:  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It depends on, like, what -- what, um, people should try to, you know, talk about that's funny.  
L:  Yeah, that's tr- true that -- true that.  I mean --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- if you're like -- if you're just, like, with your friends and, you know, then it's whatever.  It's -- it's just --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you laugh like anything, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Especially if you're drunk but, yeah, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  Um, yeah.  [LAUGH]  And then tasteful comedy.  I guess that's, like, hm.  I don't know.  I mean tasteful comedy.  I don't -- I don't see that as much nowadays, you know.  It's like -- it's like the Jackass stuff is funny but it's just [LAUGH] -- it's so, I don't know -- it's so stupid, you [LAUGH] know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's funny.  I mean, I laugh at it.  I like it.  You know, but it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just so -- it's so outrageously stupid that it's like what the hell are these guys thinking, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so ...  Um, yeah, I don't know if that's a line really but it's just -- it's still funny but it's just [LAUGH] it's not -- it's not -- it's kind of +distaste- distasteful in a way, you know.
R:  Yeah, well, I mean, I think, um, people laugh at everything.  I mean -- but, you know, when they -- when, like, comedians start talking about, like, cancer or [LAUGH] something, you know --
L:  Cancer?  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- that -- that could be kind of distasteful but then in a way, I mean, maybe, you know, people actually are thinking certain things anyway about, you know, about different subjects like that.  Like taboo subjects.
L:  Yeah.  Well, isn't that like, you know, black comedy and stuff like that.  Like the stand up comics.  Aren't they like ...  You know, uh, that's how they do like, uh, kind of perverse and racist and all that shit, you know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Like Eddie Murphy, I remember, like, I saw something a long time ago I saw, like, him making jokes and, uh, it was always like something about black people or something.  You know how [MN] -- having been poor or whatever --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  They can't afford this or that or they're not losing fat or some -- something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stupid like that.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's just -- yeah.
R:  See people laugh at that though.  Because --
L:  Yeah, they -- yeah.
R:  -- they're like -- I mean, they actually might think that.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But some people might consider that tasteless but then other people might think it's really funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Uh, what about, um -- did you see the movie Man on the Moon?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Wasn't that -- I mean, he was acting out, you know, I mean, he was having a fight but it was kind of staged, you know.  I mean, they were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible], it was like but no one else knew, you know.  It was like -- it was funny to the people who knew, you know, but the people who didn't know it was like, "What the hell?"  You know?  
R:  Yeah.  People were --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think people were kind of confused.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  Like they didn't know if he was -- if he -- it was for real or not.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I'm -- I'm not so sure he's a comic genius because you have to understand him.  I mean, comedy, a part of it's just -- it has to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be understood, you [LAUGH] know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, you have to be funny to [LAUGH] everybody.  If -- if it's not funny then it's not really comedy.  If it's too complicated it's like -- if you have to explain a joke it's not really -- you know, it's not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really a joke.  Yeah.  
R:  I think, um, Kathy Griffin is funny.  Do you know who she is?
L:  I have no clue.  [LAUGH] 
R:  She's a comedienne.  She has long red hair.  Curly red hair.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  She's real sarcastic.
L:  What kind of --  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Like I think -- I think her humor's funny but some people might -- you know, I think some people might not realise that she's actually been -- she's kind of like Jeanane Garafolo.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like real sarcastic but cynical.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I think some people, like, don't find that funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, see, I -- I don't know as much about, um, [LIPSMACK] like, comics.  Like -- like, you know, like live.  I don't watch that as much, you know.  Like -- or on TV actually.  [MN]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Most stuff I [several inaudible words] stuff [inaudible] commercials.  [LAUGH]  Like Steve Harvey is like, you know.  What is -- [MN] uh, what about the comedy TV shows?  Like, I know they don't go too perverse or anything, you know, because it is, like, general television, you know, but some of it is like they're hinting at stuff a lot, you know.
R:  Well, um, last night --
L:  [MN] All the time.
R:  -- on, um, Whose Line Is It Anyway.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I like that show.
R:  Yeah.  Did you watch it last night?
L:  No, I didn't but I like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- the show.
R:  'Cause they had Richard Simmons on.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  It was really funny.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  But, um, you know how --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, I mean, he's pretty ambiguous.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Very.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Well, I mean, 'cause you really don't know.  I mean he's never come out of the closet, technically.
L:  He doesn't say anything about it really.
R:  Yeah.
L:  He doesn't -- doesn't le- -- he leaves it to your imagination basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, he has his voice and his goofy act and, you know, the way he walks and all that stuff, but he doesn't really say anything, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You don't see him with another person like that, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah, you don't really see him -- the media covering[?] him.  So you've no clue what's going in.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  But on the show last night, um, he was like, you know, flirting with Wayne Brady and stuff.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH]
R:  And I mean it was really funny.  But in a way, I mean, like if somebody had, you know, if somebody had like an old -- like say somebody like who's totally anti homosexual or something tuned in -- tuned into that, I mean, they may have been offended.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But it was really --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- funny.  
L:  Yeah, I mean, I would think it's funny too, but it's like there's people that would get offended and I don't know.  I mean, there's always people that are gonna get offended, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Like in a comedy, for it to be really funny, you know, it's gonna have to be pointed -- directed at something, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So somebody would definitely get offended.  That's the fucking[?] problem.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I mean, I think it's kind a stupid if -- if it's -- is meant to be humorous, it's not to be offensive, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean the -- the primary goal.  I mean to take it offensively then it's like you're making more of it than it -- it's meant to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's the whole point of comedy, I mean, is to make people laugh.  
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  And -- and like I think that people laugh at things that they've -- they're familiar with.  You know.  Like things like -- like when, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- comedians talk about their mothers, you [LAUGH] know.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  Or something.
L:  But then -- but then, again, you know, that's just like -- it's not like a really hedonistic attitude like, um, for say if someone likes, like, you know, um, [MN] sadist -- like s- sadist activity, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As entertainment.  It doesn't -- it doesn't mean, like, they should have it, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, there's -- there's a certain line there because it maybe not offensive to them or the people that are doing it with them but, you know, there's some- some- some- something that's not right [LAUGH] there.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean we have some moral line but it's like it's -- it's hard to draw it [LAUGH] really.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, yeah.  I mean, I guess, if the people didn't mind I guess it would be [MN] okay, you know.  But if, I don't know, if it didn't have to do with people.  It [several inaudible words] to be like, you know.  I mean, just -- or animals or something.  I mean, you have to do something, you know.  I mean, something just, yeah, I can't think of an example right --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- now [LAUGH] but -- you know what I'm trying to say, right?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Uh, that there's a line somewhere [LAUGH] is all I can say.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [MN]  That's all I have to say really.
R:  But you like the show, Whose Line Is It Anyway?
L:  Yeah, yeah, I do.  I mean --
R:  They always have, um, sexual innuendo.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wayne Brady, like, kissed somebody, like a guy on the show.  Like, I mean, I -- I th- I think it's absolutely like, I was like, [MN].  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  What the hell?
R:  But it's funny.  Um, last night Richard Simmons was, like, all over him.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  It was hilarious.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And I mean they --
L:  That sounds cruel.
R:  -- were all laughing.  Like all the comedians and stuff were just cracking up.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, [MN].
R:  It was really funny.  
L:  Yeah, I think he kissed Drew once, actually.
R:  Oh, I wouldn't doubt --
L:  He +kissed Drew once.
R:  -- it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Huh?
R:  I wouldn't doubt it.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It was just -- yeah.  I mean, if things -- Wayne -- I don't know.  I like -- I like the black [LAUGH] guy.  He's funny.  He -- he adds a -- a -- he has a little punch to him.  You know, they all have a little different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Different things to them.  And the black guy shows, like his v- -- when he sings, you know.  It's like, what the -- how does he -- how do they sing to those songs?  They just play something on the piano, they start singing, you know.
R:  Oh, I know.  He just totally --
L:  I know his --
R:  He just, I don't know where he gets that stuff.
L:  I know.  And it's really --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- funny and stuff but it's like for him t- to make sense of it.  
R:  I know.  I think he's pretty clever though.  
L:  Yeah.  I mean, [MN] he gets to be on a TV show.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess. 
R:  But ...
L:  Yep, yep.  
R:  Like do you l- -- do you like sitcoms and stuff like that?
L:  Um, [LAUGH].  Kind [LAUGH] of.  Some of them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Depends which ones.  I mean, you know.  It depends.  If I had cable [LAUGH] maybe.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If I had better [LAUGH] cable I'd watch more of them but, you know.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess Friends used to be really good.  I mean ... 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's getting kind of old.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  [MN]
R:  They're all having babies now.  And they're all getting married --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It's breaking apart.  But --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, it used to be pretty good and then, what else is there?  Um.  Hm.  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know I can't think of --
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't really watch that many sitcoms, not like I used to.
L:  Was, uh, wasn't -- there's a [MN] -- there's one that was really good.  Seinfield was pretty good too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Seinfield's funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because it was always --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- different.  
L:  But they cancelled it so ...
R:  Well, I think they -- they thought that they wanted to end it before it started to get like Friends.  Now.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] You know.  Where Friends is --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- getting kind of, um, cliched.
L:  +Yeah. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But still people like Friends, you know.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everyone liked Friends at one time or another, you know.
R:  Mhm.
