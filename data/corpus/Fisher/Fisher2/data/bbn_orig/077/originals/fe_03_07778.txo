R:  Hello?
L:  Uh, yes, hi.  Uh, I'm Sharon.
R:  Uh, my name is Richard and I am calling from Seattle.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm calling from --
R:  Where you calling from?
L:  -- the Midwest [LAUGH], Minnesota.
R:  Cool, I was born in South Dakota.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm calling from Minnesota, so [LAUGH] ...
R:  Cool.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Comedy --
L:  Okay, wh- -- comedy, what is acceptable humor and humor in bad taste?  Uh [SIGH], huh, that's funny.  Uh, comedy happens to be one of my particular loves, so --
R:  Mine too.
L:  Really?
R:  Mine too.
L:  Okay.  Yeah?
R:  I have a roommate who is a wannabe stand up comedian --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and is actually very funny.
L:  Oh, really?  'Cause I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I've thought about doing that, even more so recently [MN] and it's funny 'cause actually, today [SIGH] I thought of something humorous that happened, you know, in -- in the building I live in --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- [SIGH] and I -- and I wrote some [LAUGH] notes down, so that's -- that's really unusual that that would be the topic.
R:  Yeah, like I'm funny without trying, but I don't know [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- having to be funny and having to make people laugh --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- I just think that would paralyze me.
L:  It's really different, yeah.  I -- I know, i- it -- it seems like when you're relaxed, it's easier to be funny, you know?  When you're --
R:  And, like anything, [SIGH] it's easier than it looks [MN].
L:  Uh-huh, absolutely.  
R:  I don't know, I think unacceptable humor is maybe something that [SIGH] truly hurts someone.
L:  Right.  Right, I agree.  Yeah.
R:  You know, like making fun of someone who can't help something, like somebody who's crippled.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it's one thing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for someone to laugh at themselves [SIGH] --
L:  Right
R:  You know?
L:  Right.  The -- [MN] I believe there was a wom- -- young woman, I, um, I haven't seen her for a long time, but I think she had multiple sclerosis or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you ever -- recall her?
R:  I do.   
L:  Like, yeah.  But she made jokes about her condition, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for someone else to do it would be really [SIGH] -- really gross, I think, yeah.
R:  'Cause I -- I know, like [LIPSMACK], um, I forget what we were watching, some kind of amateur thing on TV and [NOISE] the guy was really, really fat, but he made fun of himself.
L:  Okay, were you talking -- talking about the Last Comic Standing?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I think, actually, th- those people are professionals that, you know --
R: Really?
L:  -- haven't hit the big time.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they were awfully good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All of them were awfully good, but this guy, you know, like [SIGH], he was making fun on himself.
L:  Right, right.  But --
R:  But I know, like, lots of times when you're really, really good friends with someone [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know what's okay to [SIGH] make fun of about them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and what will tr- truly trip them.
L:  Exactly, exactly.
R:  You know, like [MN] --
L:  Yeah, you know what their sensitive areas are and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if you -- if you're going to go into those areas, then you're being malicious, I think, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And when you know it'll hurt them.  [SIGH] Uh --
R:  The only time -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
L:  Oh, uh, i- -- I was going to say, you know, when you were talking about that heavyset guy, I know exactly who you're talking about, but [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, are you familiar with Louis Anderson?  He's --
R:  Yes.  
L:  Okay, he's from this area, you know, from --
R:  Uh, yes.
L:  -- Minneapolis Saint Paul area.
R:  I am, and he is fat [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, bu- but, you know, he built, um, [inaudible] originally wrote a book of his I found at a garage sale, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he built [SIGH] his whole comedy act on the si- -- on being heavy.  And then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he was getting a lotta complaints from, you know, heavy people.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they didn't like it.  And some -- some approved and some didn't, you know?  So then [SIGH] he kind of changed the, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the basis of his act, I think, you know, kind of out- outgrew that, anyhow, but ...
R:  Now, that I didn't know about.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I think, uh, you know, a lot of it -- he grew up in a very large dysfunctional family too, so a lot of his humor is based on that.
R:  Probably, because he's homely, too [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, and, um --
L:  Well, what is that saying about humor?  Um, it's -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's like tragedy, uh --
R:  With time.
L:  -- yeah, with time, that's right.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's like, a lot of things are tragic [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then, you know, given six months or six years down the road, it ca- -- it -- you actually --
L:  Right.
R:  -- laugh about it.
L:  Right, you can laugh about things, yeah.  I've been in situations that at the time seemed, you know --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- terrible --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, yeah [LAUGH].
R:  You know, like a -- a funeral service or something that, at the time [SIGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a mistake happens and you don't laugh, because it's a sad thing, but then, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- looking back --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, I have another roommate who, looking back, they can laugh at it, because it was [SIGH] -- it was actually funny, but at the time they were so busy, you know, they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- were in the process of grieving [MN].
L:  Right, right.  That you won't -- yeah.  I can --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- remember a friend's wedding, I mean, it was almost [MN] -- almost a tragic year -- hair -- hair -- she had long hair [SIGH] and her hair caught on fire as they uncovered the -- light the --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- joined candle --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- you know, and so [SIGH], you -- you're not just a -- a --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- but it's more humorous than it was, you know, at the time, because --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it could have been really tragic, but [SIGH], um --
R:  And [MN] I think the only time -- I think the only time that you're kind of, um -- inappropr- inappropriate humor is okay is, like, if you're a heckler.  'Cause if you can --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- dish it out, you better be able to take it.
L:  Yeah.  Like, um, well, Don Rickles --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- comes to mind, right?  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and if this is --
L:  People just know he's -- he's going to do that, yeah.
R:  I -- yeah, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like he always says, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that he doesn't mean any harm, it's just, you know, part of the routine.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And he can be very insulting, but he's so funny --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] [inaudible] I didn't think of him right away, but, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a right --
L:  Th- that reminds me, too, of Dave Letterman, you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- how he -- he -- he heckles, or makes fun of Clinton and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- uh, Hillary and then --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I don't know if you saw Hillary when -- when she was on there the other night?
R:  No.
L:  But -- but, [MN] you know, she -- evidently she knows how to take him, because he said something about her, um, [LIPSMACK], uh, you know, "I'm surprised you're -- came on here, because I make fun of your husband all the time" or whatever, and she said, "Oh, you know, I didn't think you were one of the people that did that".  In other words, "I don't watch your show", [LAUGH] so, you know, so she was able to get one on by him.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In fact, [MN] know that I -- I've always enjoyed co- -- going to comedians and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] that's the only time I -- like I said, the only thing I think -- if you wanna heckle someone who's bad or you don't like, you better be able to, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- take -- take it, take it also.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But I just don't like [LIPSMACK] if -- and it's one thing to -- to make fun of general things, you know, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I always try to be careful not tell -- wait until I know someone, [MN] I know what's off limits and what's not off limits [SIGH].
L:  Right, right.
R:  Because [inaudible] like my -- my friend [MN] --
L:  Yeah, 'cause, uh, you know, especially politics.  I mean, [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- you know, um, I mean, obviously it's wide open right now for, you know, bull in terms of humor.  But if, you know, you're dealing with someone that has the opposite view to yourself [MN], yeah.
R:  It's interesting you say that because [MN] I have a friend, we've -- I've known him for thirty years and [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- we've never come close friends because [SIGH] he's always inappropriate.  He's always telling me my religion's wrong, my religious --
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  -- beliefs are wrong.
L:  -- th- that --
R:  And so, I -- I think you have to be sensitive, to be appropriate, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I just turn a deaf ear, and it's like in one ear and out the other.
L:  It -- it's amazing that you can remain friends, but you probably have other common interests that --
R:  [SIGH] Well, other common interests --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and we only see each other once a month.
L:  Okay [LAUGH].
R:  And then I --
L:  That helps too.
R:  -- I'm -- I always get a friend to come along, 'cause we go out to lunch once a month [SIGH], and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's not as bad when my friend is along.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it [MN] --
L:  A third party can help, right?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Because I just think you have to know what's off limits, and you can't just [MN] assume.  I know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know people --
L:  But do- -- does he make jokes about your religion and that or ...?
R:  [MN] Makes jokes, and if I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know how, like -- he's a dog with a sock.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Just won't get off it.
L:  Oh [LAUGH].  
R:  You know?
L:  Very funny.  He's obsessed with it.  Uh-huh.
R:  Obsessed that --  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- he has to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- think -- let me know that I'm wrong and he's right and --
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.
R:  -- I'm not gonna make it, and, you know?
L:  Oh, my goodness, okay.
R:  And it just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm like [MN], it's -- it's, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I always prepare myself, because [SIGH], um, I don't like to make people feel that way, 'cause I know how it feels, because [SIGH] I always am prepared, I'm gonna have a [MN] lunch with a lecture and [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he brings things that --
L:  You're right -- you're on the defensive right away then?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  And he'll bring articles proving I'm wrong, and it's --
L:  But do- does -- does he use humor when he does it, or --
R:  He's --
L:  -- try to use humor?
R:  -- he's really good, because he doesn't laugh at people.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But he'll, like, [SIGH] he'll laugh at my religion and it's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's -- that just shows that you -- you -- this is an area where you need some work.
L:  That -- that shows disrespect for you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  Yeah, I mean, the whole person.
R:  And I know people who --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] have no social skills [SIGH] and, um, they actually hurt people, you know?
L:  Right, right.
R:  For a while I was having [MN] leg problems and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because of the infection there was an odor, and this guy just thought it was hilarious and would humiliate me --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, dear.
R:  -- in -- in -- in a group.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And it's like, that's not funny.
L:  No, no.
R:  That's mean.
L:  Right, absolutely, yeah.
R:  And I -- I -- I don't ever find being mean spirited funny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, when it --
L:  No.
R:  -- when it's someone else's expense, that's not funny.
L:  Right, absolutely, yeah.
R:  Fortunately everybody kinda agrees with me that he's kind of an idiot [MN] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- with no social skills.
L:  So -- so no one really pays too much attention to him then?
R:  They either --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- totally [MN] -- like me, I'll never go [SIGH] to their home, even though I -- I love his -- I really like his [SIGH] -- his wife, and I really like their stepson --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but he's such a moron.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I think it isn't -- but I think some people have just never developed social skills.
L:  Yeah.  I- it's something, well, probably they've just picked up from their parents.  They never really thought about, you know, what they're doing, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  In terms of -- yeah.
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH] And, uh, [MN] but it's weird that this topic is -- my roommate and I were just talking about it.  We went to coffee and [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I was telling him, [MN] "You should try some amateur stand up comedy, 'cause you're really funny".
L:  Oh, that's cool.  So, he --
