R:  [LIPSMACK] Hello.  Uh, this is Eric.
L:  [LIPSMACK] This is Heather.
R:  Hi, Heather.  How ya doing?
L:  I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Um --
L:  This is going to be a weird topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, why don't you dive right on into it there, Heather?  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, I got married almost two years ago.
R:  Okay.
L:  To my high school sweetheart as they would call it.
R:  Wow.
L:  And we dated for two and a half years during high school I guess it was, [LIPSMACK] and then I went off to University and he stayed in state to another university.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we sort of stayed in touch.  He came and visited me but it wasn't too serious.
R:  Right.
L:  And then we broke up when we were both home one -- I think it was Christmas vacation or something like that.  We were like, "This is just not -- not going to work" you know.  "We'll go find somebody else" basically.
R:  Right.
L:  And then I graduated and moved to another state for graduate school and he stayed there 'cause he'd ended up working full time so he was still finishing where he was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, all of a sudden, once we ended up with email --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all of a sudden we got back in touch with each other and he ended up coming up here to see me.  [LIPSMACK] And I got my masters degree the same day he got his bachelors degree.  And then I went to study overseas for two years.  It was only supposed to be one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- And we ended up getting engaged while I was over there and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- then I came back so I would say he was very persistent that [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it sounds like an unique situation.
L:  Yeah, and he always said, "Well, if we're meant to be together, it will -- will happen" so we're actually leaving tomorrow to go to our ten year high school reunion.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yep.  So that's gonna be interesting.  Everyone's gonna be like, "You didn't get married like eight years ago?"  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, wow.
L:  [LAUGH] Like, "No," so ...
R:  So, is that -- is -- is you -- your husband pretty much the only person then you've really gone out with?
L:  Yeah, there -- there were some people before --
R:  Mhm.
L:  like, um, freshman year, beginning of high school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but nothing really serious.  I mean those were all like, you know, a couple of weeks and ...
R:  Ah.
L:  "This isn't gonna work," but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- after that he was -- he was the only one.  I never -- never even dated anybody else even the whole time when we weren't together.  He dated a couple of other people but he said nothing ever happened with it.
R:  Right, wow, so, it seemed like -- I mean, that sounds great.  I mean, it's great to marry your high school sweetheart, you know, um, but it -- it's definitely sounds like maybe the l- list of things you're l- looking for maybe was, you know, like perseverance obviously the top of the list.
L:  Yeah, and it just s- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- sort of hap- -- well, we met -- everyone says we met in bands because we were both in bands so we --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- always together on the band trips and football games and all of that stuff but it was actually during our math class, during sophomore year.  There was another band person, you know, and we kept staring at each other the whole class, not paying attention at all to whatever was going on, and then this girl said, you know, "I think you two need to get together" and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- and we actually went to her -- her first wedding, then she got divorced, then she got married again.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But she ended up coming to our wedding, which was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- kinda neat.  She was our, um -- was going to be our guestbook attendant.  But then we couldn't get in touch with her and -- but somehow she ended up coming.  I don't know, it's kind of -- kind of weird but she says, "I just always knew that you two needed to be together".
R:  [MN] So, what?  I mean, what -- what im- -- what made her think that?  I mean, what about the two of you really clicked?  You know, what's important?  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  You know, I mean, [MN] talking about life partners here and what -- like what -- looking back I guess you have hindsight.  I'm not --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- married.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean what? 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:   Um, and I guess I'm about the same age because I graduated high school about eleven years ago.
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  So, you know, I'm looking around -- I mean, I'm dating somebody seriously now and I have a l- lot of stuff I look for.  But I mean I'm just wondering you -- with your -- where you're coming from?  I mean, like what -- what do you look back and say, you know, this is the most important thing?  Me and my husband that, you know, make it good.  We work together or what?  Is there one thing you could point to like that?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well for some reason it seems like we communicate well --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with each other.  There doesn't ever seem to be any misunderstandings, you know.  I have -- sometimes have to drag things out of him but he always --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- does things directly.  Um [LIPSMACK] our interest in music even though mine -- that's my area.  To him it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was a hobby.
R:  Right.
L:  That was an immediate connection of things we could talk about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, Kevin always says that we look so good together but I don't know that I really went --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for looks, you know, it's not like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's not -- he's not blonde, blue eyes and what everyone thinks is -- is so great.  His, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- father is from Spain so he's got Hispanic background.  I have Italian background.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it just seemed like we always just connected on almost everything.
R:  Mhm, well that's good.
L:  Yeah, I w- I was too busy worrying about other things all the time when he was chasing me round but [LAUGH] --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- he wanted to get settled down sooner than I did.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  Well --
L:  Uh --
R:  -- [MN] first experience paid off, huh?
L:  Yeah, and I don't really know.  It's hard to explain.
R:  But communication, I guess, is pretty important I mean.
L:  Yeah, yeah and -- and we both support each other's goals.  Like he understood that I wanted to study in France and why that would be such a great opportunity for me and it wasn't like, you know, "Well, if we're gonna be together, you're staying here".
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause he wants me to be happy.  'Cause --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he wouldn't be happy being with me if I wasn't happy.
R:  Sure --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sure.
L:  So, that's been -- been a major thing 'cause we're had various, you know, long distance things and stuff with that.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and I haven't -- it hasn't gone that way in his direction as much but it has -- has some.  Like he decided he wanted to get his pilot's licence and all this stuff and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he still thinks he wants to fly for the airlines and that's all gotten messed up with nine eleven.
R:  Sure.
L:  But once I get all done with -- with school and if I can get a decent teaching position then maybe he can pursue that some more.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause right now he's the one who's doing all the major income work.
R:  Right, right.  So, um, what would you say, I mean [MN] [MN] then to someone else, I mean, you know -- how can someone else be as happy as you and your husband?  Or, I mean, you guys must fight though, right?  If you -- sometimes?
L:  Not very much but --
R:  Oh, wow.  That's really good.  I mean, what's --
L:  I think -- I think [LAUGH] --
R:  -- the secret of that.
L:  -- we -- we did more like when we were first dating.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Just because I wasn't as interested, you know.  Like I -- I didn't care really if I had a boyfriend or not.  It was like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- well, you know, I have other plans now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or I'd rather -- no.  There was a big problem with my best friend from junior high and, you know, she didn't like the fact that I suddenly had this boyfriend and she didn't have anybody and it was cutting in with time with her.  And then he didn't like that I was spending a lot of time with her.  That --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that was a major deal.  But now that, you know, I have friends and he has friends and we have joint friends that's, you know -- that's sort of high school mess.  [SIGH] We don't --
R:  Have you always lived in the same area?
L:  -- have that problem now.  Um, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, except -- 'cept when we were -- we were at, um, you know, different universities.
R:  Oh, right, right.
L:  But, um, they are --
R:  So, it's always the same crew of friends?  I mean, uh ...
L:  Yes, yes.  And now he's got work friends and I've got work friends but, you know, you see those people at work.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm not really sure.  'Cause it hasn't been for that long that we've been married.
R:  What?  A few --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- years?
L:  Almost two years.  But it d- -- it still doesn't seem that long.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Well, that's good.
L:  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there are a lot of marriages that don't even last that long, I know.
R:  No, that's good.  I mean, I was best man at [MN] my good friend's wedding and they didn't even make it to two years, you know.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, um, so ...
L:  Yeah, there was these --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- these people that were -- were here.  I actually -- I took over her job.  She was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- dating this German guy until she graduated and they got married in Germany and they moved to Germany and there were all these rumors that were going around that they were getting divorced.  But they both --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just got this new really good job over there and I heard that they bought a house so I guess they're not but ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They c- -- that -- that was more because they couldn't figure out if they were gonna live in Germany.  If they were gonna live in the US.  You know, when they were going to go to visit various relatives and culture problems and all that stuff.  That's -- that makes it hard.  At least we don't have any of that.
R:  Yeah, so I --
L:  And our --
R:  -- guess you were talking about similarities.  I mean, you and your husband have that and communicate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- well and ...
L:  Yeah, and we've got, you know, our families are in the same place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's not -- not too bad.  And since I'm working for a church I can't really ever go anywhere at Christmas until Christmas day anyway and they all --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they all understand that so I have the same -- the same support that I have from my husband, I have from my parents and that's always ...
R:  That's great. 
L:  [MN]
R:  That's good.
L:  And good.
R:  Wow.  Well, I mean, sounds like you, you know -- I mean, I'm really happy for you.  I mean, it sounds like y- it really worked out.  I mean, it's really, you know, fifty fifty shot with marriages [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, you know, so that's really good.
L:  Yeah, and I wasn't expecting him to ask me when he did.  It was just totally --
