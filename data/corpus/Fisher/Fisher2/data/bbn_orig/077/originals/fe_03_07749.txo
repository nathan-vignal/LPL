R:  Hi.  Uh, hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Polly.
R:  Hi, my name is Jean, how are you?
L:  Fine.  How are you doing?
R:  Okay.  I've never done one of these before. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, neither have I, this is my first phone call. [LAUGH]
R:  I was hoping I would, uh, have somebody who knew what they were doing. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh no.
R:  So we're just supposed to discuss the topic and that's it?
L:  Yeah, supposed to discuss the topic for, I think, ten minutes.
R:  Is this being recorded?  It must be, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  What state do you live in?
L:  Um, this is Mississippi.
R:  Oh really?  Oh, I live in Massachusetts.  Oh my God, totally different.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I don't even know -- I thought the minimum wage was different in every state.
L:  Um, I -- I really think that, um, different states can, um, pass their own laws on minimum wage.
R:  'Cause I --
L:  I mean, I know there's like a federal standard --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- they all have to meet something, but I think they can go over it if they want.
R:  Yeah.  Because I thought in Massachusetts I thought the minimum wage was at least like, six fifty.
L:  It might be.  They might have passed their own state law that makes it a little bit higher.  But I think as long as it meets the federal law --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's fine.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  'Cause when I was y- like, oh my God, when I made minimum wage, probably about fifteen years ago, I think even at that time I was making four fifty.
L:  Yeah, I was -- I think I made like, three twenty five or something.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  I don't remember.
R:  Yeah, I don't either. [LAUGH]
L:  I know it was ages ago.  I didn't even know what the minimum wage was right now.
R:  I didn't either.  When they said five fifteen I was like, "Are you kidding me?"
L:  Yeah, that doesn't sound like much.
R:  No, no.
L:  Especially now with the economy, everything is so high.
R:  I know.  I live in Boston too, so it's so expensive.
L:  It's amazing.  We just moved to Mississippi and I thought that the economy here, I mean, you know, you think the South, I thought everything was gonna be kinda cheap.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And it's --
R:  Isn't it?
L:  -- this little -- no!  Amazingly, this little tiny town we're in is really high.
R:  Really?
L:  So yeah, I don't know what their minimum wage is here, but --
R:  Where did you move there from?
L:  Louisiana.
R:  Oh my God.
L:  So --
R:  I would've thought Louisiana would've been more expensive.
L:  No, actually this whole rural part of Mississippi is outrageous.
R:  Really?  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Ah.
L:  But still five -- five fifteen does not seem like much.
R:  I know, it doesn't.
L:  So --
R:  At all.  I can't imagine.  I mean, you definitely couldn't make that here --
L:  I don't know how you could live on that.
R:  -- and live.
L:  I'm not sure even where the poverty line is.  It used to be like, twenty thousand, if you made less than -- or maybe it was fifteen thousand.
R:  Yeah, you know what, I think you're right.
L:  If you made fifteen thousand or less, you know, you were declared abs- -- you know, in poverty.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, so I'm not sure what five dollars an hour would get you.  Let's see, forty hours a week, what's that?  Eight hundred?
R:  Eight hundred.  Yeah.
L:  Eight hundred a week?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.
L:  So ...
R:  Um, when I -- let's see, like, five years ago I used to work at Sears and we hired people in, you know, just, I don't know, just cashiers, and even they were paid I think like -- how much was that?  I think it -- well, maybe like five fifty was the minimum that we hired people at, I don't really remember.  I don't know.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, it's just not enough.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So the question was, do we support the increase to five fifteen or do we think that's enough?
L:  Oh, I would support the increase if it's less than that now, yes, I --
R:  But yeah, I would too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would think it should be even a little bit higher really.
L:  Yeah, it really should be.
R:  The only people that could really afford to live off of that would be like, teenagers who just [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- are working part time to have a little spending cash.
L:  Yeah.  I certainly hope it's -- n- uh, you know, there's not laborers out there making minimum wage, that would be really awful.
R:  I know, I wonder.  It doesn't seem like it's possible but maybe it is.
L:  Oh, I'm sure it is, I mean, I'm sure --
R:  Where --
L:  -- there's farmhands and migrant workers and all that just --
R:  You think they're paid like, legally anyway though?  I don't know, maybe they're not.
L:  That's true.
R:  I don't know.  Where do -- where is the cheapest place in the country to live, do you know?
L:  Oh, I have no idea.
R:  I don't either. [LAUGH]
L:  I just -- I've always heard that, you know, I mean, and I know that housing and all is a lot cheaper down south, and there's no -- and Louisiana has got really low property tax.
R:  Oh really?
L:  I mean, that's a big deal there, you just, you know, yeah, they'll bite your head off if you try and raise the property tax.
R:  Oh really?  Oh, that's good.
L:  But sales tax is high.
R:  Oh, what -- what is it?
L:  Well, they tax food, I don't know if they do that there?
R:  Oh, really?  No.
L:  And they tax -- see, when we moved to New +York, Nor- -- [MN] New York one time and they didn't tax food and I was like, "Wow!"
R:  Right.
L:  But yeah, we tax food.  They tax, um, everything else, you know.
R:  Do they tax clothing too?
L:  Yes, of course.
R:  Really?  We do- --
L:  And it's all like at eight point --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- five percent I believe.
R:  That's high.
L:  So ...
R:  They call Massachusetts, Taxachusetts! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  But we a- -- we actually don't pay those taxes and our sales tax is pretty low, it's only five percent.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  I think it -- yeah, I think it's five, or it may be six -- no, I think it's five.  But we pay tax -- we pay a lot of miscellaneous fees and tolls.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Like, the big thing here is you pay a toll every mile.  You can't drive a mile without paying a toll.
L:  Really?
R:  Oh yeah, it's crazy.
L:  Oh that's weird.
R:  I drive -- I drive to see one of my girlfriends who lives about forty five minutes away and I end up paying like, six dollars in tolls.
L:  Wow.
R:  We pay tolls everywhere.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  Mhm.  So, but I guess -- I guess we're lucky in other ways.  So, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  You stay on this topic?  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh I know.  Um, let's see, back to five fifteen.
R:  Five fifteen an hour.  Yep, no, don't think it's enough. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well that wouldn't pay your tolls! [LAUGH]
R:  No, it wouldn't.  [LAUGH]
L:  You'd have to work two hours to be able to pay that toll. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Wouldn't it?
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I wonder what jobs actually pay minimum wage now?
R:  I know, I was wondering that too.
L:  I'm trying to think what jobs would start you out.
R:  I don't even think like -- I don't know, McDonald's or a grocery store, but I'm sure they pay more.
L:  Yeah, fast food places probably start you out.
R:  I think that they -- those jobs actually pay a little bit more sometimes.
L:  Really?
R:  More than that.  I can't imagine they would pay so low.  Maybe like, small independent --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like Mom and Pop shops.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have no idea.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't know.  My husband -- we have a business, we have a hair salon.
L:  Uh, um, we're in the army, so --
R:  Oh you are?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  We -- we hire people and even -- well, we pay them like, eight bucks an hour.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, just to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- answer the phone.  But it -- it's kind of, I don't know.  I guess it depends.  It must depend too because you know what?  Here, in this area of the country -- I -- I used to live in Pennsylvania and when I lived there I grew up there.  Like, there are no jobs anywhere, we used to fight for jobs.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if you had a job, you held onto it.  They were so difficult to come by, I mean, it's completely different than Boston.  And, um, if you had a job you held onto -- onto it, you know, kids would be fighting for summer jobs at the grocery store --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- they were so hard to find.  Here, every place is -- every place you go has a Help Wanted sign up.  Hang on a second, my husband is shouting to me.  Hold on.
L:  [SIGH] Okay.
R:  M- Mark, I'm on the phone.  I'm on the phone. I'll -- I'll call you back in a minute.  I'm -- I'm talking to somebody for -- can I just call you in a minute.  I'm doing a survey for ten dollars on the phone.  [several inaudible words]  I know, I didn't -- I can't answer.  I'm -- oh well, I can't.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [several inaudible words]  Only a few more minutes.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Our -- our hair salon is next door to the house.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And he's shouting into me, he -- he was calling me on call waiting and I wasn't answering.
L:  Oh!
R:  He wants me to come help him [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I don't want to! [LAUGH]
L:  I thought I had missed these phone calls.
R:  I did too.
L:  'Cause I signed up a week or two ago.
R:  Yeah, how did you hear about it?
L:  RMC.
R:  Oh, I don't know --
L:  The -- it's a refunding, um, website.
R:  RMC?
L:  I think, [inaudible] yeah, RMC. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, okay, yeah.  I do a different one, Freelance by You.
L:  Oh.
R:  And --
L:  Which one is it?
R:  It's called Freelance by You.
L:  I've never heard of that.
R:  Oh, it's awesome.  It's just Freelance B.Y.U. dot com.
L:  B.Y.U.
R:  It's awesome.
L:  I'm might have to look at that.
R:  Oh yeah, you have to check it out, it's like -- it's really good.  They have like, every day they have different sections.  They do -- they have like, +a -- a whole page every day and they have a section of sales and then like, coupons, and then f- like, rebates, and then they have a section of free samples. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, I'm gonna have to look into that.
R:  I go for that one every day.  I -- ever since I started I get like, one or two samples of everything you can think of in the mail every day [LAUGH].  I get the silliest things.  My husband's like, "Why are we getting all this crap in the mail?" [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my husband does the same thing.
R:  But it's fun, I love it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know. 
R:  Yeah, that's what I do at work all day. [LAUGH]  Yeah.  So anyway, yeah, but I was saying here they, um, like, every store has Help Wanted signs, there's so many jobs.  And also, like, a lot of the bigger stores, they do bonuses, you know, um, apply for a job here and get hired and you get like, a hundred dollars.  At Christmas they usually up it to like, five hundred.
L:  Wow, I've never heard of that.
R:  That's how desperate they are for people to work.  They're s- uh, there's just so much stuff here, they can't -- they can't pay people to work those jobs, you know --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- like at Dunkin Donuts or McDonald's, nobody wants to work at those jobs.
L:  Oh wow.  Jobs are kinda hard to come by in Louisiana.
R:  Yeah.  See, it's different here.  And also like, the grocery store next to me, to -- to start they pay nine fifty an hour to work at the grocery store.
L:  Wow.
R:  I know.
L:  I'd be working part time if I could do that. [LAUGH]
R:  Seriously.  I mean, it pays a lot.  So --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- it's just different here.
L:  I bet -- bet the cost of living is probably, though, is really high, huh?
R:  Oh it is.  Like, housing is ridiculous.  We could never afford a house.  We rent, you know.
L:  Oh, we rent too.  We have to rent everywhere we go.
R:  So what, you're in the military though?
