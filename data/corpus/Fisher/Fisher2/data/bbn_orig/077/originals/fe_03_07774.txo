L:  Really?  Well, actually I'm just another person too.
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's it.  
L:  [MN] I don't know.  Usually, like, talk about the subject for a little bit and then we just talk about whatever.
R:  Like what type of comedy?  Like comedy on TV [NOISE] or --
L:  Yeah, what kind of comedy do you like? [MN]

L:  Yeah?  
R:  No, I'm -- I -- I don't know, I like all -- the Hot Chick, it came round not too long ago, the movie.
L:  Which movie?
R:  The Hot Chick, where the bodies get switched.  And the girl wakes up as a man and the -- the guy wakes up as a woman.
L:  What movie's that? [MN]
R:  The Hot Chick.  It's -- it's hilarious.  I watched it three times, and I laughed all three times [LAUGH].
L:  The Hot Chick --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who -- who's in it?  
R:  Oh, [LIPSMACK] did you ever watch Animal, the movie Animal?
L:  No.  
R:  I can't think of his name.  He's got curly hair, he fits the part just perfectly.  Oh, damn.  I can't think of his name.
L:  No?
R:  [MN] But it's -- it's real good.  I advise everybody to watch it that like comedies.
L:  Oh, okay.  I haven't seen that, I'll have to see it.
R:  Yes.  It's real good -- of course, I mean, I wouldn't know -- you just went in there and rent it.  I thought it'd be stupid, you know, but we had rented all the movies in the movie store [LAUGH] that was the new releases.
L:  Right, right.  
R:  And all.  So, I got that one just to see what it was about and it was a lot better than what I thought it would be.
L:  Mm.  Did you see The, uh, Full Monty?
R:  Oh, I think so [SIGH].
L:  With the guy who -- British guys that were gonna dance? [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  I thought that was pretty funny.  That's actually my wife's favorite movie.
R:  I don't know -- I've seen -- we -- we rent three or four movies a weekend, so --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- like, every weekend.  It's hard to get a babysitter for three kids [LAUGH].
L:  That's true, that's true.  So, are you a stay at home mom?
R:  Yeah, I go school, I sell Avon, oh --
L:  What're you going to school for?
R:  I'm [inaudible] to be a paramedic.
L:  Be a paramedic?  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm a firefighter EMT.
R:  Do what?
L:  I'm a firefighter.
R:  Yeah, I'm gonna try it and hopefully I can be a paramedic [NOISE].
L:  Yeah?  So, are you gonna work for an ambulance service, or a county or a city or what?
R:  Ambulance service.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How far in are you?
R:  Well, I start in August [LAUGH], so --
L:  You start in August?
R:  Yeah, I actually start in June, but I start in August, so I've got enrolled and everything, so --
L:  Well, that's good.  And you're going to class every day or what?
R:  [SIGH] Well, I will be as soon as August gets here.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm trying to enjoy my summer.  Summer is like my time, I can't stand the winter, so --
L:  Is it -- but is it school every day, or ...?
R:  Well, I think so, I think so.  I haven't -- you know, I haven't looked all over my paperwork yet.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I try to wait to the last minute to do everything.  I know that sounds crazy, but --
L:  So, what made you choose paramedic? [MN]
R:  Well, I looked in -- they sent me, uh -- I'm going to Colan[?], they sent me a book with just like a bunch of different careers and stuff, and I only found, like, three or four of them that I was even, you know, slightly interested in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, that was cosmetology, and then the paramedic field, and then, uh, majoring in counselling, which that takes, like, eight years and I'm not a very patient person.  So, ain't no way [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] How long's the paramedic program?
R:  Two years.  
L:  Two years?
R:  Two years.  Gotta learn CPR, how to +resuscitate, you gotta be able to stand blood, that's the main thing.  You gotta be able to handle --
L:  You gonna -- you're gonna learn a lot more than CPR [MN], I'll tell you that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I'll learn more, but, you know ...
L:  You gonna learn how to intubate somebody, you're gonna learn how to cut their throat open and put a tube in it so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they can breathe.
R:  Yeah, how to learn -- how to run a drip and stuff like that.
L:  Right, right.  Well, 'cause I -- I work for, um, Montgomery County Fire Rescue outside of D.C.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, we have a medic unit in our -- in our house.  I ride on the ambulance sometime, and, uh, we get -- we get pretty busy.  Definitely.  
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, where I live [MN] it's a -- dull.  There is nothing down here to do.  All the entertainment we have is a theater [SIGH] and a skate rink.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  There's no Six Flags or anything of that sort.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it gets pretty dull around here, and the hospital's, uh, it's just a little [inaudible], you know?  Not much, you know, they don't do all that much.   
L:  So, what's the big -- what's the big city you live by?  What's the closest big city?
R:  Jackson [NOISE].
L:  Jackson?  So you -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in northern Mississippi?
R:  No, I'm in, uh, I'm further down south.  I'm, like, right below Jackson, toward the south.
L:  Oh, okay [SIGH].  You live close to the Gulf, or ...?
R:  [NOISE] Nope [LAUGH].
L:  You're landlocked.
R:  [NOISE] Oh --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- I'm close to -- I'm close to Louisiana.
L:  You got swamps down there? [SIGH]
R:  Nuh uh. 
L:  No?
R:  Not that I know of [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Did you grow up there?  Spend your whole life --
R:  Yeah.  I've -- I've -- I've been here all my life.  I'm twenty three, I've been here a while.
L:  So, did you get -- you got married right outta high school?
R:  I ain't married.
L:  [MN]
R:  Engaged for the last six years [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah?  When you getting married? [SIGH]
R:  I ain't planning on it any time soon [LAUGH].
L:  No?
R:  [MN] I ain't planning on it any time soon, that's all.
L:  Oh, okay. [SIGH] So, but yeah, you got three kids, gonna be a paramedic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, if you like adventure, you'll like being a paramedic.  And you'll get used to the blood and the guts and the smells and stuff.  It takes a while, but you get used to it.
R:  Yeah, I fi- -- I don't figure it'll -- it'll bother me all that much.
L:  No?  I -- I think, you know, my word of advice to you would be treat every patient like it's your grandma or your grandpa.
R:  Right, yeah.  I mean, I get -- the only th- -- the only problem I think I would have would be getting emotionally attached to [MN] somebody.
L:  Right, and that -- that -- sometimes that's tough, 'cause you meet these people and you feel so bad for 'em, you know?  You're like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what -- what -- you know, what can I do to help this person?  And [SIGH], you know, they're -- they're -- I mean, they're calling you, like, on the worst day of their life.
R:  Right.
L:  You gotta remember that, you know?  And be patient with them.  And some -- sometimes you're gonna get calls that you think are so stupid [SIGH] but you still gotta just be nice to the people, you know?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I'm -- I'm -- I'm a -- I don't know, I'm kind of a people person.
L:  Yeah?  [SIGH] Well, that's --
R:  You know, I can -- you know, I -- I work with people better one on one basis than just, you know, just -- other than being in front of a crowd, so ...
L:  Right, right.  [SIGH] Well, that's good.
R:  Well, my first thing, I was gonna major in counselling, but I don't know, I just don't think I could handle eight years.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And then I was gonna go for cosmetology, but that just -- [MN] well, from the pay these days is something that I can enjoy, so ...
L:  Right, yeah.  Yeah, and probably being on your feet all day.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's probably a good decision.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, cosmetology, it don't pay worse than nothing, and you gotta make, say, a hundred people happy, you know? [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  Someone coming in, they don't know what they want, and then some women will tell you what they want and then when you do it, they're not happy, so ...
L:  Right, right.  
R:  I don't know.
L:  So, have you -- have you, uh, travelled outside of Mississippi much?
R:  Not that much.  I've been to Tennessee, uh, and I've been to Louisiana [LIPSMACK], I've been to Atlanta, Georgia, uh, that's about it.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Well, I've been to -- I've been the coast too, I've been to, uh, Pasagola.
L:  Yeah, down on the Gulf?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a -- I have- -- you know, that's one -- down south, in the Deep South, I have not been to that area.  Never been to New Orleans.  Was gonna go to New Orleans a couple years ago, but we didn't end up going.
R:  Oh, I love it.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure it's --
R:  I love it.
L:  -- a neat place.
R:  Could you hold on a minute?  I got a beep.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  And now I'm waiting [SIGH]. [PAUSE] I am waiting and waiting and you guys are supposed to be recording my voice, and I don't wanna get --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kicked out of the survey for not talking, so --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  That's all right, I'll just keep talking.
R:  [LAUGH] But, uh --
L:  Didn't want all this dead air space.
R:  But New Orleans is -- is, like, I don't know [SIGH].  Depending on the person that you -- you know, what type of person you are, [LIPSMACK] you know, if you like to have fun, if you like to party, you know?  Course --
L:  Yeah, do you like to party?
R:  Huh? [NOISE]
L:  Have you been down there for Mardi Gras?
R:  Oh, I love it.  My brother just got arrested the last Mardi Gras down there.
L:  Did he?
R:  He's fixing to go to [inaudible].
L:  Do you do whatever you can to get beat[?] --
