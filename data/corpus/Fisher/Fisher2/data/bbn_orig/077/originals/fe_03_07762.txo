L:  Hi, this is Davin.
R:  Hi, this is Barbara.  Uh, I guess our subject --
L:  Hi, Barbara.
R:  Hi [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, let's see, I guess we're supposed to note the time.  I've got five after seven.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Um, what do you think about raising the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- minimum wage to five dollars and fifteen cents?
L:  Well, I'm trying to -- I'm trying to think it out [MN].  I thought the federal minimum wage wa- -- already was [NOISE] five fifteen.  Um, are you in California?
R:  Yes, uh, I'm in a little town called Anderson, California.
L:  Anderson, okay, I'm --
R:  And it's about eight miles south of Redding.
L:  Okay.  I'm in, uh, I'm in central Los Angeles [MN].  Um, which, you know, of course here there's a -- there's a higher minimum wage than that.
R:  Yes, I think -- you know, when you get into your real large population areas, they do -- just salaries in general seem to be better.
L:  [MN] Well, they -- you know, one hopes.  In this, uh -- I think in this economy it's a [LAUGH] little bit of harder reality for a lot of people, but, um --
R:  Well, that's probably true right now.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh, wha- what -- what is your view on -- on -- on -- on, you know, maybe not just the five fifteen, on, you know, do -- do you think that the -- do you think that's enough?  Do you think it's too much?  
R:  [SIGH] Well, I sure don't think it's too much, uh, although I remember [LIPSMACK], oh gosh, two, three years back when I was living in Spokane, Washington --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it -- they were discussing th- -- uh, raising the minimum wage and at that time they were gonna raise it, in fact they did raise it to five twenty five, so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I -- I'm not too sure.  Is this five fifteen a federal or a state?
L:  That's a -- that's a federal, uh, that's -- that's the federal minim- -- that's the very minimum that any state [MN] -- and I think that's -- it basically addresses the, um, states which have the poorest economies [SIGH] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- are -- are gonna be the ones who, um, [MN] you know, [LIPSMACK] uh, you know, a state that just [SIGH] -- just doesn't have the jobs --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they're having such a hard time keeping their economy going, and, you know, they can't, uh, [MN] you know.  I -- I think in -- in the larger, you know, th- there's a lot of rural communities [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, it's 'cause it, uh, it sorta depends on, you know, on the cost of living.  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, the, uh -- you know, say in, like, New York City or San Francisco, um, you know there -- there's just a whole lot of problems because rents are so high --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- around there, and -- and you end up with these situations where [SIGH], uh, you've got a whole class, sort of, of, um, service workers say, like people who d- -- you know, wash cars, or work in r- -- you know, in --
R:  Restaurants.
L:  -- kitchens or restaurants, and they can't afford to live anywhere near where they work [LAUGH].  Um --
R:  Exactly, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean Santa Cruz -- no, was it Santa Cruz?  Just in the last couple of years did a radical [LIPSMACK] -- had a radical change because, um, of the dot com boom, and so many people moving into the Bay area.  And people were willing to commute for, you know, two hours to get into the city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And there was people working in San Francisco who were living, you know, as far away as Monterey [SIGH].
R:  Oh, that's terrible [LAUGH].
L:  And -- yeah -- and it got so bad that, you know, the rents got so high that Santa Cruz finally st- -- they -- they passed a local ordinance, I think, on a city level and raised their minimum wage to something like [MN] twelve dollars an hour [SIGH].
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  And said, "Well, you know, these people, you know, we've -- we've -- somebody has to work at Wendy's" [LAUGH].
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  "And we can't ask 'em to drive for six hours to get there, you know, we're just not gonna have any [SIGH] -- not gonna have any services", so this is the only, you know, it was a -- a --
R:  It was the only poss- -- only possibility really.
L:  Yeah, and it -- you know, 'cause of the -- the -- the -- the property value up there, um, you know, was just -- I just came from up there watching a friend get married this last weekend [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, uh, [LIPSMACK] you know, the, uh, the -- the bride's, uh, sister lives on -- in a place in the Santa Cruz mountains on t- -- on top of a mountain, it's a twenty acre spread up there [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's fantastic.  And, you know, when they told me [LAUGH] what they had dropped down for it, I -- my jaw hit the floor [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH].
L:  [SIGH] It was in the millions [MN] though, can say that.
R:  Well, we're undergoing something kinda interesting here.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], Anderson is a really small town --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it only has a population of about ten -- uh, oh, about ten thousand.
L:  Oh, yeah, okay.
R:  And then Redding, to our north --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, they've posted their population now as eighty seven thousand eight hundred [MN] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but really with surrounding areas --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's a good hundred thousand.
L:  Okay.
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- our -- our real estate prices in the last two years have just been going crazy.
L:  Going up?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, and, you know, not only to buy property and a home --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but also to rent.
L:  [SIGH] Right, right.
R:  And, um, I don't know --
L:  It's kind of happened -- it -- I think it's related to what -- what's happening in -- with the economy overall in the country [SIGH], uh, is there -- we're in a rec- recession, or a near recession or however it is that, you know, you interpret the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] those kinda forecasts.  But there's, you know, there's -- there's been a big dip down in the market, and, um, there's joblessness and -- and people just aren't making money [SIGH] and -- but yet, the one thing in our economy that has -- there's actually a bubble in is real estate [LIPSMACK].
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  And this creates this really big tension in so many places because, you know, the real estate's fine, which is great if you're a homeowner [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, uh -- but, you know --
R:  But if you're not and you wanna be [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, if you're not and you wanna be, or if you wanna move to a place and -- and -- and rent for a while, it's -- it's, uh, you know, it becomes, uh, pretty difficult, yeah, to, uh, to find a -- uh, yeah, I worked a -- I -- I work part time at an animal rescue foundation here in LA and then I go to school, trying to finish up a, uh, uh, bachelor's degree [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, rely on the student loans pretty much, and -- and whatever grants and stuff that I can scrounge up --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, and it's -- you know, the cost of li- -- that doesn't -- that's not a -- those aren't a j- -- those are federal so they're not adjusted for cost of living [SIGH] [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, and -- and it's like -- it's really -- it's really a scrape, you know.  Every now and then I can find [SIGH], uh, contract work as a -- as a writer and as a, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing internet stuff, you know, and -- but, uh --
R:  Well, that would be kinda interesting. 
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, it's -- sometimes they're still out there, it just that so many [SIGH] you know -- I was telecommuting from here, uh, in -- in this apartment here in LA, uh, working for an internet company [LIPSMACK] and they --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they said [LIPSMACK], um, you know, "We wanna get you up here, 'cause we like to have everybody in house", and I said, "Well, you know, you know, make me an offer" and they said, "Well, [SIGH] w- we can't really help you relocate, but, uh, you know, we can pay you thirty thousand dollars a year for the job".  And I [MN] was like, "What?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Excuse me?  To live in San Francisco?  You want me to live there on that?", you know, they were like -- 
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  -- and they were serious, you know?  And they said, "Well --"
R:  You'd have to -- you'd have to be a street person [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  I said, "You know, where does it -- you know, where's this magical neighborhood where I can afford to live on [LAUGH] thirty thousand dollars in San Francisco?" and they said, "Well, you know, a lot of people have roommates".  And I'm like, "Okay, so let's see, if I leave at night and get up there, you know, say at like nine in the morning, I'd have, oh what?  And you're not helping -- you know, you're not gonna help me relocate, so I'd have, what, maybe, like, twelve hours to find a roommate?" [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I actually told them this.  I actually said, "Well, here's -- here's the way I'm looking at it, you know [COUGH].  You've offered me that salary and I'll -- you know, I'll take that offer, but the nearest apartment I can find to San Francisco that I can afford on that is this one that I have here".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Okay, so why don't I just, you know, telecommute from [MN] here?"  And they did it -- they we- -- they -- they finally went for it.  Um --
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  But then the dot com crash happened and they just -- they laid off two hundred and forty people from a [SIGH] five hundred person company [LAUGH].  It was just --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah, it was a -- it was a real, uh, it was a real tumultuous time.  But [MN], yeah, so I'm -- I've -- I've kinda been, you know, like a lotta people, acutely aware of [SIGH] -- of those kinds of, uh, you know, conflicts.  You know, you've got a lot of people in this country now who are, you know, underemployed.  They've -- they've taken on, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- whatever kind of jobs to make things meet, and there's a --
R:  Kinda like the working poor, really.
L:  Yeah, yeah, and, you know, and that -- that's who I work -- you know, I work, uh, I work part time in an animal rescue foundation [SIGH] and, you know, she pays ten bucks an hour [LIPSMACK], the -- the -- the founder --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, which as far as -- as animal workers go is, you know, that's a good wage, you know, even here in Los Angeles [MN].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Well, a lot of the other places pay, you know, seven, eight dollars an hour for a -- you know, for kennel help [SIGH].
R:  Hm.
L:  And, you know, part of the reason I do it is, you know, because I love animals and I'd, you know, like to be involved and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I do some adoption counselling.  But yeah -- [SIGH] but it's, you know, the -- the pay checks are just kinda [MN] -- you know, it's -- it's -- it's a little beer money [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  You know, it's -- it's, you know, it's ten dollars an hour.  And I mean, you take taxes out of that and you just, you know, it's -- it's nothing you could [SIGH] -- and I wonder a lot, like, "Gosh, how's -- how are people doing this?", you know?
R:  Well, I don't know.
L:  Uh ...
R:  You know, these -- our real estate and rent prices here are -- are really throwing people an eight ball because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- basically --
