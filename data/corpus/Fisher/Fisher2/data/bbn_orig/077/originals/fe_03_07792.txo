L:  Tammy.
R:  Hi, hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Yes, hi.  [LAUGH] I'm Cindy.
L:  Hi, Cindy.  I'm Tammy.
R:  [LAUGH]  How you doing?
L:  Hi.  I'm doing well, thank you.  Okay, our con- -- our, uh, [COUGH] topic's comedy.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, what do they want -- really want us to dwell on?  Where we draw the line?
R:  Yeah, I guess.  Um ...
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, for m- -- for me it's --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- easy, I'm [COUGH], 'scuse me, I'm -- I'm a pastor's wife.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...  [LAUGH]  It's -- it's pretty -- pretty cut and dry --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- for me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, [COUGH] I'm a sitcom person.
R:  Oh, I am too.
L:  Um, [MN] so I do have a problem though with some of these comedies that are put out and the -- the -- the sense of humor [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, sure, yeah.
L:  -- um, uh --
R:  Well, I've got, um, a [inaudible] called TV Guardian.  
L:  Okay.
R:  And, as a matter of fact, um, on most of the, um, VCRs we have it's built on.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, yeah.  So that we can control and -- and a lot of the movies or sitcoms or TV, uh, shows that we like to watch --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- would be fine if [MN] -- if -- if not for the language.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, the ones that have, you know, sexuality and things like that in it, that's not necessary.  We don't even both with those.
L:  [MN]  Most definitely.
R:  But -- 
L:  I agree.
R:  Yeah, but there a lot of 'em that are -- that are really funny and they're -- they're innocent and they're fun but for the language.
L:  Yeah
R:  Like I feel like they --
L:  And -- and why -- why do they feel they have to put that in?
R:  I don't know.
L:  [MN]
R:  Unless it's -- I mean, I -- I get it for movies.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  They think that G rating is boom, you know, they're not gonna get any people buying tickets so they'll slip a word or two in there just to make that PG rating.
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  [LAUGH]  But for my kids, I mean, we just have the built in TV Guardian, even for ourselves.
L:  That is wonderful.
R:  Yeah, so it -- it works out a lot better.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We can watch those movies and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, not have to worry about it.  
L:  I'm -- I'm very particular.  I don't have children but, like, my nieces are here with me now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I honestly don't let them watch a lot of [LAUGH] television.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, the Disney Channel I just turned on for 'em.  I feel that's pretty safe.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but pretty much anything else, uh, I don't really let them watch too [LAUGH] much.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  It's -- it's -- it's -- 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I got three boys.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, so they -- they want a see everything.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's --
R:  But --
L:  -- really difficult --
R:  It is.
L:  -- these days I think sometimes to really, you know ...
R:  It is.  Um, we have a, you know, we have a policy with movies now.  A- anything that we rent, mom and dad have to see it first.  
L:  Oh, wonderful.
R:  Before, you know --
L:  Wonderful.
R:  -- before the family watches it at all.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But once we've okayed --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- it they can watch it as much --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as they [LAUGH] want to.  
L:  Yeah.  My husband --
R:  So ...
L:  -- and I went to a movie, um, not too long ago, um, we had free tickets.  It was a freebie so we went and I was so disgusted with some of the parents that brought children.  I thought how could you bring your child to a movie like this.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know, it -- it shows, uh, the funny scenes on TV but --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- you know.  [MN]
R:  We went to, um, Titanic --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- when it first came out.  And we s- -- we didn't know anything about it.  This is a few years ago. We stopped at the [MN] -- at the front and asked the man, was this appropriate for -- for our whole family?  For our children?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at the time our kids were, let's see, five, seven -- five, eight and ni- -- and ten.  And he said, "Oh, yeah.  Very educational".
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]  You know.  And we got in there and the first ten minutes --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Now I realise later that the rest of the movie wasn't quite as bad language wise but there still were some scenes in there --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that we didn't like.  But in the -- the first ten minutes where the sink --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the -- the ship is beginning to sink and there's all this cursing and screaming and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, uh, vulgar language.  I just -- I -- I just sat there [MN] [LAUGH] dumbfounded, you know.  And we -- my husband, he picked up the kids and out the door we went.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And he went and told that man, he says, "How dare you tell me this is suitable for this age of children?"
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, we got our money back.  [LAUGH]  And he --
L:  I so agree.
R:  He wanted to give us vouchers or tickets to come back to another movie.  He said, "No".  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.
L:  I so agree.  
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Um ...
R:  But for us it's just a lot easier most of the time we'll just wait 'til it comes on video.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  We can preview it that way.
L:  Mom and dad can preview it first.  I -- I agree.  You know, I --
R:  I -- I like -- I like humor.  My favorite -- my favorite sitcom --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- is, um, Everybody Loves Raymond.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, we love that one too.
R:  Have you ever seen that one?
L:  Yes.
R:  [MN]  I love that.
L:  What a family.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Because it's funny and it's -- it's really funny --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- based on family life.
L:  It -- it so is.  And it's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my gosh, does that remind you of someone?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I know, my husband --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- and I all the [LAUGH] time.
L:  I so agree.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Everytime she'll do something he'll look at me and he'll say, "See.  See".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, that's what you do.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But you know, there -- there -- there are a --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- few things that, you know, I look at and I say, "Well, you know, not in my house but ..."  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, it's still funny.  You can see everybody's not the same and that's fun.  But, um, the TV Guardian.  You know, any time they do slip in those words, we don't even notice it anymore.
L:  That is wonderful.
R:  We love it.  Oh, we love it so much and now we've become very sensitive too.  When we hear other people walk by --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just using that language it just sort of [MN] cuts you inside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because you're so not used to hearing it.  [MN]  Which is great.  And that's what I tell my kids.  I said, "I know you hear this at school" because, you know, one of them's high school now and one's in middle school.  I say, "I know you hear this at school and I know you hear this practically everywhere you go".
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, and [MN] -- it's -- it's that hard to control.  That is so --
R:  No.
L:  -- difficult.
R:  Yeah.  And I said --
L:  You know.
R:  -- but the thing is I want you --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- to be sensitive to it.  
L:  Yes.
R:  I don't want it to beg- -- become to where it's acceptable everywhere you go.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  You know, so that when you do hear it I want it to affect you --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- just like killing and death.  
L:  Yes.
R:  I -- I want it to affect you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- when you see it so if we watch a movie that's really about war and it's really historical, you know, and it's -- it's really got people dying.  I said, I want that [MN] because it does.  They look at that and they go, "Wow, is it really -- was it really that bad?"
L:  Yeah, that's life.
R:  You know, I want it to affect them.
L:  Yes.  And understand.  Exactly.  I agree.
R:  So ...  Yeah, I love comedy though.  I'm -- I'm --
L:  I do too.  I -- you know, [MN] I think I like it [MN] more than over drama because there's so much hatred in the world and so much --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- sadness that sometimes I just need to sit down and laugh a little.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, oh, see.
L:  And -- and, um, I just have a hard time watching [MN] a dramatic show and that.  I just can't.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, my whole day.  
L:  [COUGH]
R:  My end of my day all I want to do is just go in my bedroom, turn on something really stupid that I don't have to think about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't have -- I don't have to make --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- make sense out of.  [LAUGH] 
L:  My brain doesn't have to work for this.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  I know.
R:  And just let them make me laugh.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes, I agree.
R:  I do like that.
L:  I agree.
R:  But, yeah, I think it oversteps whenever they, um, trample on [MN], uh, ethnicity.  They start, you know, talking about culture.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Making fun of people simply but for a color of their skin.  Uh, when they start putting down religious, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- people who stand for r- -- certain religious beliefs.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  You know, I have very, very strong convictions being a pastor's wife.  Extremely con- -- strong --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- convictions and people I totally don't agree with, but I also don't appreciate them making fun of [MN] theirs or mine.  You know, I think that's disrespectful.
L:  I agree.  
R:  But, oh, gosh, there's so much in everyday life to make fun [LAUGH] of.
L:  There really is.  And if you make fun of it in the [LAUGH] right way I guess, just --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- appreciate what's out there, you know, and ...
R:  Sure.  
L:  And, um [MN] ...
R:  A- a- animals are always funny.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, the animals.  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I mean animals are always funny and -- and --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I don't really like those, uh, v- -- hidden videos or --
L:  Those funny --
R:  -- funny video things.
L:  -- videos?  Yeah.
R:  But my husband and kids --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- they crack up.
L:  But [MN] -- well, I will watch that and just, like, you said for the animals.  My husband and I will sit there rolling.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And for other things I'll be like, "Doug, that was, like, so stupid".
R:  I [LAUGH] know.
L:  "Why would anybody even do something like that?  It wasn't even funny".  You know and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But you know, you're flipping --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- channels and y- you know, [MN] it doesn't matter.  We used to get all the channels except the, uh, extra pay movie channels.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We -- we --
L:  Yeah, we don't get those.
R:  Because we figured they weren't worth our [LAUGH] time.
L:  They're -- they're not worth my time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, not worth --
R:  We get all these channels and you can still slip.  You can go through these channels three times and it takes you twenty minutes to go through 'em that many ti- --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, three times.  And find nothing worth --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- watching.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it -- it's -- it is hard.
L:  Grab a good book.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, I just, um --
R:  Or go to sleep.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, but like I teach Sunday School so it's like, you know, even in, uh, Sunday School class, like last week we talked about, uh, I always ask 'em, "So how has your week been?  And what did you do yesterday?"  And, you know, they'll tell me if they went to the movies, like they saw, uh, Finding Nemo.
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, the mom just loved it.  I haven't seen it yet.
R:  Really?  I haven't either.
L:  But, uh, they said, "Oh, it was the funniest movie".  And I've heard such good reviews on it.
R:  I hope it's good.
L:  So ...
R:  Because mine -- mine wa- mine want to see it.
L:  Yeah, I would love to take my nieces.  Um ...
R:  You know, they had Toy Story.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  That was, I mean, I liked it.
L:  I never really seen it yet.
R:  How -- I thought it was great.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Toy Story and Toy Story two.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And I thought, "Okay, I'm an adult and I don't like cartoons".
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  At all.  
L:  That's me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I can't stand [LAUGH] cartoons.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  And I can't stand these -- these kiddy shows.
L:  No.
R:  You know and I have to tolerate 'em long enough to see -- you know, check it out and see if --
L:  Have to -- right.
R:  -- my sons are allowed to watch it.  But, um, I would rather just say, "No, I don't think it's gonna be any [LAUGH] good".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Than have to watch it.  But these -- I mean, the Toy Story shows, they were funny.  And they were great.  
L:  Oh, I'll have to catch --
R:  And so I'm hoping -- yeah, I'm hoping Nemo's like that.
L:  Oh.  Well, the mothers had nothing but good praises for it.  She just loved it.  
R:  Really?
L:  And, um, yeah.  And, uh, even on the radio they were giving it like high -- such high remarks saying this is probably one of the best Disney movies out right now.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know.
R:  We do a lot of veggietales.  [COUGH]
L:  Oh, aren't they wonderful.
R:  They are.  And they're funny.  
L:  Love it.
R:  And they can be so funny.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Anytime you've got a -- a, um --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a cucumber running things.
L:  [LAUGH]  It's wonderful.
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know why --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's funny but it [LAUGH] is.  
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know but, you know what, it held my interest.  
R:  Sure.
L:  So there's something there.  You know.
R:  Yeah. Veg- -- uh, veggie --
L:  And, uh --
R:  -- tales.  Vegetables being in charge is --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [LAUGH] cracks me up.
L:  Yeah, I took my nephew to see Jonah.  It was --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- wonderful.  And then I --
R:  Was it --
L:  -- got him the CD.  We loved it.
R:  We didn't even get to see yet.
L:  I -- and, you know, here I am thirty eight years old and I want the movie and I want the song, you know, the song track.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So I can sit at my desk and listen to this.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh --
L:  I just love it.
R:  -- my husband -- my husband's at a swap meet today and he came back so excited.  He'd bought all these movies at the swap meet and, uh, I was looking.  I said, "My gosh --"
L:  [COUGH]
R:  "-- how many movies do need?"  And -- and six out of eight of 'em were veggietales that we didn't ha-
