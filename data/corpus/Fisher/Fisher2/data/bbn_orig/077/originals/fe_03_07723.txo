R:  Hi.  This is George.
L:  Hi.  This is Glenda.
R:  How are you?
L:  [MN] I'm good.  You?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  Good.  Okay.  So, minimum wage.  [MN] [several inaudible words] -- 
R:  Not enough.
L:  Not enough.  Yes -- 
R:  Not -- 
L:  -- I agree.
R:  -- not -- not even close.
L:  Well, I think it may be for most places, like, um, I don't know, ah, states that have a lot of small towns and things like that where the cost of living is a lot smaller.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, I don't even think California's is enough.  Like, s- -- what is it, six seventy five now?
R:  I don't know.  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's -- I'm in California so, um, like, well, we live in two states where the cost of living is just insane.
R:  Yes.
L:  Um, so I'm going to go with no, and also I think a lot of people choose to be unemployed rather than to work because they can get, um, like what is it, um, unemployment and they'll get paid more than they would if they actually had a job paying minimum wage.
R:  Yeah, that's the problem.  It -- it -- 
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- alm- -- it almost encourages some people to go that route.
L:  Mhm.  I agree.
R:  Which is not -- not good.
L:  No, it's not.  I know.  I just -- I know people that have done that before and it's just kind of, ah, it's just -- it -- it -- it shows that there isn't really as much of a work ethic to me.  But, I don't know, I really hate working for minimum wage too so I can't really blame 'em.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I don't know, it's just -- that's my opinion, um -- 
R:  Ah, I had a speciality food store, ah, for about five years which I -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- closed a couple of years ago and I had -- yeah, I hired a lot of workers that would normally get the minimum wage but I gave them about two dollars more an hour as a starting rate just because of the competition in this city.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And even for people making seven fifty an hour at an entry level job, um, it -- it wasn't enough for them to have any quality of life.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, it kind of didn't even help them meet their basic needs.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, really -- really a tough situation here.  It -- I don't know how to get around it or what the, um, incentive is for the government to do something about it and for the people to have access to more benefits but it's, ah -- just -- 
L:  I know.
R:  -- it just seems so out of line with reality.
L:  Yeah.  Maybe if they -- I was actually like, um, in this office today just staring at that minimum wage poster right before I got on the phone with you -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- oddly enough and, um, like, it -- I -- I wonder if maybe they just created that for kids that are just starting to get their jobs and they don't expect adults to be working for this minimum wage amount of money.  So, the people who should be getting paid minimum wage are sixteen year olds rather than twenty some odd year olds or thirty year olds, you know?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [MN] Um, so, in that case it would be okay but I think once you get to a certain age you have more responsibility, that's just, ah, you -- 
R:  Yeah, kids that -- 
L:  -- education -- 
R:  -- kids that still live at home or are going to -- to school or something.  I mean that's -- 
L:  That's fine.
R:  -- not a bad idea but -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, you have responsibilities and you have a -- you know, you're married and you have children.  It's just brutal for these --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people. 
L:  And that's why they should get more education, in my opinion, but, I don't know.
R:  The other problem with minimum wage is that in -- in -- for most employers there's absolutely no other benefits.
L:  Mhm.  I know.  So, um, yeah, I know, but if it's minimum wage and then, like, there's very little in, like, ways of paying, are you still, like -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- why do you get, like, ten, fifteen cents for a raise?
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, there's not -- 
R:  And the -- 
L:  -- really much -- 
R:  -- and the thing about -- you know, when you look at minimum wage you have to look at the whole picture, I think, of a -- of the, ah, employment, ah, situation.  The -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the unemployment versus employment situation and the other wage scales.  So, you have this humongous gap between regular basic workers doing a basic job.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Whether you're a teenager or you're twenty up until retirement you're still going to get basic wage if you can't get -- minimum wage if you can't get some skills.
L:  Right.
R:  Then you have really unskilled non professionals who are protected by the union who are getting two, three, four and five times that per hour.
L:  That's true.  I agree -- 
R:  Ah -- ah, but, so, what is the alternative?  That the whole country gets unionized for everything, you know, to -- to -- to get people rights and benefits?  There's -- and the thing is just so out of scale.
L:  Yeah, I know.  I'm a teacher so I'm really big on the union thing, um, and, like, how much you should be paid for what you're doing, um, and, yeah, there're a lot of hard jobs out there that people aren't being paid enough for and I think this is truly unfair.  But, I mean, I -- I -- I just don't know how to get people out of these minimum wage jobs, like, aside from educating them and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- like that's -- since that's my field I'm just, you know, gun-ho about all that.  Um, but, I just -- I don't know.  I -- I think that, yeah, it's -- it's acceptable for five fifteen.  Like, I don't know, I grew up in Indiana and that was fine.  Like five fifteen was great.  I mean, it helped me out back there but [NOISE] I don't know, minimum wage in California you'd make, like, a thousand dollars a month and that's what, twelve thousand dollars a year?  You're not going to survive off that unless you're married to somebody rich.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, I don't know.  I'm just thinking of -- it's just your kids.
R:  Yeah.  I mean -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's just no place there that -- that -- first of all, [inaudible] is the biggest problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and the thing is, is that what's not taken into consideration, some companies I've -- I've noticed around the country are providing -- like, I was visiting friends in Vale last year.
L:  Ah, in Vale? 
R:  In -- in Vale.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And Vale has, um, you know extraordinarily wealthy patronage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the people who live there are extraordinarily wealthy people who come there, obviously have wealth to be able to pay the kind of [LAUGH] money it costs to fly there and to live -- to live there -- 
L:  I know.  I know somebody that worked there --  
R:  -- for a week or two and -- 
L:  -- [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.  But, what was really great, it was that they were actually -- you know, these people all expect service.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the service sector is usually in the low end of the -- of the -- of the --  
L:  Pay.
R:  -- of the pay scale.
L:  Yeah.
R:  M- -- ah, cl- closer to minimum wage.
L:  But, you can't live there.
R:  Ah, what -- but, what they're doing, they're -- this is really social responsibility.  They are building housing for the service sector.
L:  Ooh, it's -- 
R:  That -- 
L:  -- like a caste system.
R:  -- that is -- that is -- that provides them a -- a very, very, very low cost housing -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that they can then serve the community.
L:  Oh, that's a good idea.  But, it -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- kind of separates them from everybody else.
R:  Well, but were else are they going to live?  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's true.  I don't know.
R:  I mean, that's the alternative is the -- at least, I think, ah, innovative and creative and provides a solution to a problem.
L:  You know, they -- ah, hm.
R:  So, what they've all agreed is that they will -- they will put up so much for -- for so many people, they'll put up so much housing based on the service number of -- that they're required f- f- for the amount of population that comes in and out of that -- that -- that -- that, ah, city.
L:  Yeah, and you know, there isn't enough housing for the amount of -- like, I -- I was taking this cultural diversity class and the amount of housing for people that make that amount of money, it's like, I don't know, um, there's half as much housing as there are people that make that amount of money -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, um, where are they supposed to go?  And that's why we have so many homeless people and that's why we have all these, like, single mothers who have kids that can't go anywhere and just -- it's just -- it's so sad that we don't have the resources [MN] for all these people that we say should be able to survive off of that amount of money.
R:  Right.
L:  So, [MN] that's as far as we -- 
R:  Interesting.
L:  -- [MN] um, what is it?  Yeah, like the -- the -- what -- what is the, um, the poverty level.  It -- it just -- ah, what is it?  Nearly twelve thousand dollars or something better or nationwide?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Something like that.  Um, [NOISE] I just find that so amusing.  I can't even imagine being able to live off of that.  And I -- and I think that was a family of four.  Maybe it was eighteen thousand dollars.  I don't know, but, um, it's just -- it, [MN] it just -- oh, it's so sad to me.  [MN] Hm.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know what the answer is.  I don't see anybody ever on Capital Hill fighting for it.
L:  No.
R:  Um, you know that's the -- the -- the priorities are so out of whack for what the reality is -- n- needs that the reality of this country are.  It's just, um, [MN] you know, I mean, there are -- there are -- there are, ah, elective officials who -- who do stand for, um, higher wages.
L:  Mhm.
R:  E- especially at minimum wage but it -- it -- just -- things are just -- there's no, y- you know, what I mean, ah, well, how are these people that can't even pay their rent, how are they going to pay for their health care?  How are they going to pay for -- 
L:  They're not.
R:  You know, I -- I mean, and so where do they go?  They go to st- -- they go to city hospitals -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are funded by the tax payers money and they give ten dollars for a five hundred dollar visit because it's all they can afford and the city can't turn them away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, then the -- so, then the tax -- the cit- -- the cities go into debt, ah, w- -- budget.  You know, their budget's tot- totally out of kilter because they're absorbing this.  Why not just face reality and do something about it?
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.
R:  You know, g- get credits for so many weeks you work, you know, and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and -- and have, like, a -- h- have -- it's like you bank your miles, you bank your, ah, your -- your dollars.  How about bank -- y- -- like a frequent flyer [LAUGH] program.
L:  Yeah.
R:  How about bank hours that you work for so many credits for your health care in the future, in it.
L:  Well, I think -- I think they should just have more -- ah, like, my sister lives in a place where, um, if you're somebody that makes the minimum wage you can actually live there and it's a nice place because they go off of how much money you make and then that decides what your rent is.  So, [MN] like if you're not really making a lot of money you can still survive in a city that, you know, a- a- -- you know, req- requires a lot more money generally.  So -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you could get housing like that that isn't scary, people might, you know, be more willing to live there.  But, [MN] I don't know.  [MN] I think that's an interesting idea to -- to -- to space it off of what you make rather than some flat fee.
