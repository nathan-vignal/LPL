R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.  Who am I speaking with?
R:  My name is Kristen.
L:  Kristen?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Um, St Petersburg, Florida.
L:  Oh, oh, I have a -- a friend that lives in Atlanta Lakes.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.  I'm, uh -- my name is Linda and I'm calling from Grand Pass, Oregon.
R:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, what was -- what was the topic that we were supposed to talk about?
L:  The ...
R:  Qualities in a lifelong partner?
L:  Right.  Uh-huh.
R:  Okay.  Well ...
L:  And why it's important to have, uh, a lifelong partner.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, are you married?
R:  No, I'm -- I'm with someone though and we have a little girl --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- but we're -- I guess we're planning on getting married in the future, but we're, you know, trying to get settled first.  [LAUGH]
L:  Good.  Yeah.  Well, this is my second marriage and I was married for eighteen years the first time --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and very -- in a very unhappy relationship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and my second marriage -- I never ever expected to be married again and I married a man who was, uh, an alcoholic, uh, of past.  He -- he's been sober now for thirty years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he's probably the nicest, kindest man in the world.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Because of his troubles that he had had in his earlier years he -- he very definitely appreciates the -- the quality of -- of life with a lifelong partner and we've been married now for twenty two years and plan to be married forever.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  And you -- you just seem to, um [LIPSMACK] -- you seem to work harder when you have a marriage because you, uh -- you have that commitment to each other.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And so -- so we're -- we're very firm believers of -- of a marriage commitment and a lifelong partner, someone who -- who not only is your husband or your wife, but they're -- they're -- they're your best friend.  They're someone you can talk to and tell your deepest secrets to --
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  -- and it's -- and it's, uh -- it's a very good feeling and in my -- in my position my husband and I are both Christians and we both attend church.  Um, when I -- when I first moved here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, to Oregon, uh, I wasn't attending church, although I did believe in God I -- I wasn't attending church, I'd had a -- a bad marriage and -- and it just wasn't there for me.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, I met my husband and he did attend and I became attending with him after we had been going together for about a year --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and now it's our life.  So, I -- besides having him in my life I have him to thank for bringing me back to Christ.
R:  That's good too.  That's very good.
L:  Yeah.  So, tell me about yourself?
R:  Well [LAUGH], um, let's see.  Um, I -- well, I've -- I've lived here pretty much all my life, but then, um, I moved to Tennessee with my Mom and, uh -- for a while 'cause things weren't going so good here and, um -- and eventually, uh, the man I'm with now, uh, he was a friend a long, long time ago.  We dated previous --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then, um, things just didn't work out at the time 'cause we were both kinda young and it just didn't work out very well and, um -- and then [SIGH], uh, I was having some problems up there and, um, he drove up there and picked me up and brought me down here and he bought me and my, um -- and our daughter a -- a house to live in and --
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and stuff like that and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so we got back together and he -- he is like -- you know, like you were saying, he is like my best friend.  I can tell him anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We talk about everything and -- and, you know, that's -- that's all important like you said.
L:  That's very, very important and ...
R:  Very important 'cause if you can't talk to them as a friend then how are you supposed to be anything else?
L:  Right.  But, you know, you'll -- you'll find -- you'll find it even a closer relationship once you marry --
R:  Well ...  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because you ha- -- you have that commitment to one another --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and things just become closer for you.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  It's -- it's amazing and -- and -- and maybe you don't believe what I'm saying --
R:  I do.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it's true.  Yeah.  It's very true.  Uh-huh.  How old are you?
R:  I'm only nineteen.  That's why we're not rushing this whole marriage thing --
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and that's -- you know, I'm -- I'm kinda still, um -- I'm going to school and stuff and, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and trying to get things together so that, you know, I can provide a life, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Where -- where do you -- where do you go to school?
R:  Well, right now, um -- right now I'm doing this, uh -- it's like a home school program 'cause my daughter's oh, only eighteen months --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I found it kinda hard to find somebody that -- take care of her during the day while I was at school --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and to work and everything like that --
L:  I see.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so, um, I'm doing a home --
L:  Well, that's ...
R:  -- school program.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I guess as soon as I'm done with this since I'm almost done in like a month or two, um, I'm going to, uh, S.P.C., which is St Petersburg's College [LAUGH] and --
L:  Oh, how wonderful.
R:  -- and I'm gonna go for my, uh, degree in psychology there.
L:  Oh, wonderful.  Wonderful.
R:  So, that's what I'm planning on doing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which he's very supportive and all that too so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he helps me.
L:  I lived -- I lived for ten years in Florida.  I lived over in -- in the Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale area --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] and, um -- and when I divorced my husband -- well, I had -- I hadn't worked.  I married right outta high school at -- at the age of seventeen --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- you know, and had my first baby when I was eighteen --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, uh -- and so I was totally unskilled.  But -- but yet I knew that I didn't want to, um, sling hash [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- you know, for a living and -- and so I went back to school and -- and he paid for it and -- and I became a nurse.  I went to, uh -- to school in, um -- in, uh, Brown -- Brown County, uh, Brown Medical Center is where I trained.
R:  Right.  I've -- I've actually seen that.  I used to go by there all the time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And -- and so I got my training there and I worked there for a while and then I finally just moved out here with my daughter [LIPSMACK] and my son had graduated from high school already and, uh, I moved out here with my daughter in nineteen seventy six and she was -- she was thirteen at the time.  So, we, uh -- we just began living out here.  My parents had moved here and -- and actually I am an Oregonian by birth.  I was born up in Portland.  So, uh, it was familiar ground to me and, uh, so I'm very happy to be here and it's just, uh -- it's a -- it's a great way of life and [LIPSMACK] so, in fact, my daughter is -- is leaving, uh -- she lives up in Vancouver, Washington, and she and her husband and family are leaving Saturday night, they're flying back to Florida.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  They're going -- they're gonna go to Orlando and, uh -- and take the kids to Disney World.  They've never been to --
R:  Oh, Disney World.  Yeah.
L:  -- either of the Disney parks.  So, one is thirteen and one is ten.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, uh, I think the boys will really enjoy that.  [LIPSMACK]  But, uh ...
R:  Oh, that -- yeah, they will.  I -- I used to [LAUGH] love Disney World when I was little.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, uh -- that'll -- I've been there -- I've been there once and that was just about -- oh, about six weeks after they opened up [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- and it was pretty sp- sparse looking at that time, but I understand they have a lotta new parks and ...
R:  A lot of stuff.  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- I know the kids are gonna stay -- they're gonna stay in one of the Disney resorts, but I don't know which one.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  But they're sure looking forward to it.
R:  They -- yeah, I -- yeah, I like Disney World myself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's fun.
L:  Yeah.  And her -- her Dad lives over in Tampa and so she'll be able to visit him.  She's not seen him in thirteen years.
R:  Wow!
L:  So -- so she's gonna, uh, be seeing him and then she's gonna visit with her brother who lives up in Stark and so it's -- they're gonna have a little family reunion, which is nice.
R:  That's real nice.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And then she has a very, very close relationship with my husband who she calls her Pop [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh. 
L:  -- and, uh, they're very close, uh, they couldn't be much closer than -- than if he were her biological father --
R:  That's so nice.
L:  -- and a lot of it is because of him and how he has always treated her, you know?  He's always been so good to her and -- and, um [LIPSMACK], has always been there for her and, uh -- and that's just part of the, uh -- the make up of him when he stopped -- well, after he stopped his drinking and then he became a Christian, just became part of his everyday make up and he's, like I said, probably one of the kindest men I've ever known in my life.
R:  He sounds like a great guy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  He -- he really is.  He's, uh -- he just turned sixty six in March and he's just, uh -- he's a wonderful man and he -- he sure has been through a lot with me.  I -- I didn't realize when we were married in eighty one that -- that I had, um, a bad illness.  I had to have a liver transplant --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- five and a half years ago --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- and, boy, he was right there for me every step of the way and it's -- and it's a fight every day of our lives, you know?  Even now after five and a half years --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it's -- a l- -- a lotta medications, very costly, and he just hangs right in there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, he's so sweet.  [LAUGH]
L:  And from the sounds of your -- of your boyfriend I would say he sounds like he would be the same way with you.
R:  He is.  He's sweet.  I mean, he -- we're both young, you know?
L:  Sure.
R:  He's -- he's -- he's only twenty.  So, I mean, we're both young, we're -- you know?  And his -- his family got, um -- got us a deal on this house and it's a really, really nice house and we'd be paying -- we wouldn't even be able to afford it.  But, um, we pay, you know, three fifty a month for this house, which is outrageous comparing to what it is, you know?
