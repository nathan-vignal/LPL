L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  My name's Bruce Williams.
L:  Hi.  I'm Patty.
R:  Hi, how are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  Good.
L:  I w- -- I work -- I'm glad they told us what the minimum wage was 'cause I didn't know what it was.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Five -- five dollars and fifteen cents.  That's pretty low.
R:  Yeah.  It's been like that for some time now.
L:  Okay.  And they want to increase it.
R:  I don't think so.  I don't think they're going to try to increase it any time soon.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yeah, that's not, ah -- of course, it depends on, um, I guess what your situation is.  Whether, you know, if you're a kid at home with your parents, five dollars that would be probably okay but if you're trying to feed two kids and pay an apartment [MN] then it probably wouldn't work out.
R:  No, definitely.
L:  You know, it depends -- it depends -- I think it depends on your situation.  Of -- 
R:  Well, I'm -- 
L:  -- course -- 
R:  -- I -- 
L:  -- if you're low income you could probably get help with housing.  I don't know.  I don't know what, ah -- 
R:  Yeah, even with -- even with that, ah -- given that, I don't -- I think it should increase.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do, ah, 'cause it's been like that for sometime now and -- 
L:  Oh, has it?  Okay -- 
R:  -- e- everything else is going -- 
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- in- increasing, why not that?
L:  Okay.  So, they don't increase that every year then?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, yeah, maybe since they increase, like, social security benefits and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- things like that that -- like a cost of living increase -- 
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- then maybe they should do that.  Of course, they could increase my pay check too.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] That's what I'm talking about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Everyone can [inaudible] use an increase [MN] especially around now when everything is so -- I mean, I'm in New York and due to that World Trade Center thing, I mean, it's really hard and -- 
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  -- I think they should definitely try to do something to benefit the public now.
L:  Correct.  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  You know, and it seems like they're doing everything backwards.  I mean, instead of increasing jobs they're -- it seems like we're losing jobs, they're, ah, increasing budget cuts and it's like there's some craziness going on here.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I can imagine.  Yeah, I couldn't live on five fifteen an hour so [MN] I guess -- I guess we agree then that they should increase it and they should increase it every year by a certain percentage or cost of living or however they handle social security.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's what, ah, I think.  [LAUGH] And then maybe -- yeah -- 
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- maybe take into consideration and -- 
R:  Well, how do -- what do you -- I mean, if you really wanted -- if you wanted to complain about that, where do you go?
L:  [MN] I have no idea.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, because they definitely -- I mean, that's something to really think about.  I mean, most people don't really think about it but -- 
L:  Right.  I don't know who decides -- who decides that the minimum wage is that.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I don't know +whom.  I guess the government.
R:  Probably.
L:  I guess you could probably, ah, complain to your, ah, senators or something like that.  Yeah.  I'm not really sure.  Thank God I don't make five dollars and fifteen cents an hour.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I couldn't -- I could probab- -- I couldn't live on it.  I'd have to -- I wouldn't be in a house or have a car, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause you figure five -- I mean, that'd be like two hundred dollars a week -- 
R:  Yeah, that wouldn't even -- 
L:  -- less taxes, you know, you'd be -- that'd be --  
R:  -- that wouldn't even pay -- 
L:  -- oh, maybe a hundred and fifty a week.
R:  It don't even pay the -- 
L:  I don't know.
R:  -- rent.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] And then you -- you know, you figure -- I mean, most rents are, like, around here are like five or six hundred and I'm sure in New York -- 
R:  Yeah, it's a lot more.
L:  A [LAUGH] lot more.  So, I mean, you would -- you wouldn't be eating.
R:  No.  You'd just be surviving.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You'd have to move in with about twenty other people.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Really.
L:  Oh, my.  Oh.
R:  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.  That's not good.  This is definitely not -- five fifteen is not good.  But, it's good for a kid that's living at home with his parents.  You know, like a sixteen year old.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, that's plenty of money for them.  Of course, they have those expensive -- 
R:  Yeah, that's what I mean even -- 
L:  -- sneakers and jeans.
R:  -- even with the kids now, I mean, they -- they -- they would probably be complaining about it also because -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- they [LAUGH], I mean, they -- they have a budget man that's out of this world nowadays.
L:  Yeah, that's true -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] 
L:  -- but then maybe they don't -- maybe they'd realise they don't need those fancy shoes and fancy cars and -- 
R:  Yeah, I tried -- 
L:  -- you know, everything that we have that we worked for, ah, all -- you know, most of our life.  So -- 
R:  Ah, try telling them that though.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's true.  Kids are different nowadays.  So -- 
R:  Yeah.  They -- they -- 
L:  [MN] Yeah, definitely -- definitely change five dollars and fifteen cents an hour.  I didn't even know -- I -- I was thinking when they called, I thought, "I hope they tell me what the minimum wage is 'cause I don't know".  And then I thought maybe it was around seven.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I mean -- 
L:  You know?
R:  -- and actually I was -- ah, I was talking about this the other day [several inaudible words], ah, I had actually forgotten or really thought it may have went and -- went up by now but it was five fifteen.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and that's --  
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I mean, that's been like that for a while now.
L:  Mm.  That's awful.
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  Of course, when I worked -- started working, um, I was a -- worked as a tipped employee and I think I made ninety cents and -- ninety eight cents an hour, something like that for a tip and I think minimum wage then was only, like, a dollar fifteen.
R:  Ah.
L:  And now, not that I'm not old, but [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, gosh, that was awful and -- you know, when you thought you were making ninety eight cents an hour but then you -- you depended on your tips. 
R:  Right.
L:  You know, which took you well over five fifteen an hour, you know?  So, but, it's really bad.  It's really bad.
R:  Yeah, I guess, I'm -- I'm going to look into it though 'cause, you know, it's a reason for me.  I mean, I'm -- like I said the other day it just -- for some reason I asked a girlfriend of mine what was the minimum wage because like you I had totally no idea.  I -- 
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- thought maybe it at least went up to six something, I mean, it's still -- 
L:  Yeah, well -- 
R:  -- five -- 
L:  -- you get caught up in your own little s- -- world you don't really consider other people's -- you know, what they're making or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  The only thing I know is that people like Madonna and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] Really?
L:  -- or movie stars and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the sports figures.  [LAUGH] But, they're making a whole lot more than I am.  So, yeah, that's sad.  Five fifteen, that's really sad.
R:  Yeah, and even the kids, ah, [MN] the kids don't even want to work for that now.
L:  Mm mm.  No.  Well, they don't -- I don't think they really want to work, you know?
R:  Yeah, aside from that, huh?  [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] You know, they want their parents to take care of them all the time.  So -- 
R:  And this five fifteen definitely is not an incentive.
L:  No, it isn't.  But, I know I worked when I was a kid 'cause I wanted things.  So -- and my parents wouldn't give them to me so I did, you know, I worked. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- 
R:  Me too.  You know, you did what you had to do then.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But -- 
L:  Right.
R:  Now things have -- 
L:  Yep.
R:  -- changed and it's really -- 
L:  So, are you in the heart of New York?
R:  Basically right across the street from Manhat- -- well, across the Hudson from Manhattan, Staten Island.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I just could stand right here and look at the World Trade Center -- 
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- from my house and -- 
L:  Were you there -- were you there when, ah, the World -- 
R:  Yeah.  I wasn't in the city, thank God, that day and I was scheduled to be over there that day and you know, about a week before my sch- -- ah, schedule changed and -- 
L:  Oh, good.
R:  So, I wasn't actually there.  But, I was [several inaudible words] like, the next day.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I even have ashes from the, ah, ground zero.
L:  Oh, okay.  Wow -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a sad day.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  Ah, [SIGH] well, I don't know what else to say about five fifteen an hour except we agree that it needs to be increased.  Definitely -- definitely increased.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Of course -- 
R:  And a -- 
L:  -- everybody -- I guess everybody feels that way, their pay check should be -- 
R:  Well, I'm going to -- 
L:  -- their pay check should -- 
R:  -- look into it.  I'm going to find out -- ah, I don't know if you go to the labor department or government or senator -- 
L:  Yeah, all right -- 
R:  -- or whatever, but -- 
L:  -- you know, I think they have it -- but, I think there is something posted on the bulletin board here at work that does tell you what the minimum wage is but I never really paid attention to it.  So, maybe even if you -- well, could find something like that then you could, ah -- 
R:  Oh, yes, I've seen those things, yeah -- 
L:  You know what I mean?  Write to somebody or -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I -- [inaudible] -- I think when I'm done I'll go look at it.  [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's over in the lunch room but, you know, it's one of those things, you know, a big bulletin board but you never read it [LAUGH] --  
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause it's -- 
R:  Yeah, there might -- 
L:  -- you know stuff -- 
R:  -- be some information on it I could use.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'll --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- check that out.
L:  [MN] Yep.  I think our ten minutes is almost there.  [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sometimes the topics are -- they go quick -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then this one here is kind of a -- 
R:  Yeah, I think we've probably -- 
L:  -- a dragging -- 
R:  -- been over ten minutes here.
L:  [LAUGH] A drag -- drag -- a dragging, ah -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's like, "Well, do you like it or don't you?  Yes or no?"  That doesn't take ten minutes to answer.  You know, it's like, oh, you know?  Of course, it was interesting to find out what, you know, maybe we could do about it or, you know, go look -- go look at it in the caf- cafeteria and actually read it, you know, and see what it does say and see -- 
R:  Yeah.  Well, I hope this -- they -- they --
