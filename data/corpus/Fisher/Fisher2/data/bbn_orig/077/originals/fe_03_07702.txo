L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, hello.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  My name's Audrey and I'm in Los Angeles.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] I'm Steven and I'm in Orange County.
L:  [NOISE] Ah, so we're in California?
R:  Yes.
L:  Sometimes people are in M- Montreal and -- and goodness knows where.  Okay, so, um, [NOISE] topic is what is, ah, er [MN] -- what do you find most important in a life partner?  Um, do you wanna start?  [NOISE]
R:  Sure.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Basically I look for, uh, trust --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, attraction --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to, um [LIPSMACK] having p- similar --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things in common, a person to relate to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- somebody's that's outgoing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [LIPSMACK] uh, down to earth.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, what about yourself?
L:  [NOISE] Um, okay, well I think friendship.  [NOISE] Friendship is the most important thing because, um, [NOISE] things like sex and things wear off in time and if you're not friends, [NOISE] uh, there's no -- you know, that's an end to the relationship so friendship, [NOISE] common interests, um, mm [PAUSE] [NOISE] ...  I -- I think age is immaterial because sometimes, uh, a younger person can -- can bring new interest into your life and sometimes an older person with their [inaudible] is, um, hopeful- hopefully wisdom, um [NOISE] can also be, uh, interesting.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [NOISE] this is a difficult subject.  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] I can't really think.  Uh, [NOISE] I know that, uh, I -- I -- I find difficulty in -- in making friends because, uh, I'm from England.  [NOISE] I'm outspoken, opinionated, um, [NOISE] and, uh, it -- it's not [MN] [MN] [MN] -- you know what I find strange is, um, [NOISE] in America, people don't, for some reason -- don't publicly speak their minds.  [NOISE] They may think something and say something privately but publicly they don't do that.  Whereas in Britain, people are very outspoken.  [NOISE] Um, [NOISE] why do you think this is?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I -- I kind of think the opposite of you.  Uh, because, uh, th- the people I -- I, uh, [COUGH] associate with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we're all extroverts.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And basically we all sh- -- uh, [MN] speak our mind.  [SIGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, we -- we hold nothing back.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] if, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- pretty much if somebody has a difference of opinion, well go ahead.  Express your differences of opinion --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I'll respect it.  [MN] Obviously, we're all respect it.  Um, but I haven't found anybody that really --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- hasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had, um, to hold anything back from like telling the other person what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what's on their mind or what's in their heart or -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or whatever.  Um, basically just, um, I -- I'm an extrovert.  I'm a Scorpio.
L:  You're a what?
R:  I'm a Scorpio.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So Scorpios are more, uh, in line to, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- strong opinion about everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Um, as the zodiac sign says, um, [LIPSMACK] and pretty much, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I haven't met anybody yet that [MN] doesn't speak his or her mind, so ...
L:  Ah, obviously then your friends are well educated and intelligent but they are not the majority.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I haven't met somebody yet that's -- that's not educated or who's like pretty much says like the most stupidest things or -- or what not.  I mean, they have, um -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they voice an opinion and they have, um -- they have facts to back it up.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, um, I understand what you're saying that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, where you're from everybody seems to voice whatever concerns or what, uh, their opinions are.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, as far as [MN] me, um, I haven't met anybody yet who doesn't have an opinion about anything 'cause people'll voice it and it's like, "Hey, that's cool".
L:  [LAUGH] Anyway so, um, the lifelong- -long partners, uh, mm ...  So, if you think that -- do you think that, um, two people can be lifelong partners if they have opposing opinions and can argue in a reasonably, um, [NOISE] [MN] intelligent manner without getting abusive or [MN] [NOISE] very hostile, do you think that a lifetime partner can have opposing opinions?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, i- i- in a re- life time partner situation, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- i- if -- if both, um, [MN] parties of the -- of the partnership have the same opinions about things, it's kinda boring.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  For a while and so, what's the use?  But it's al- it's always good to have difference of opinions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about things.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, I think -- I think it can work out with the right partner, um, with difference of opinions.  It's just you have to know, uh, how to stay calm and rational.
L:  Right, rationality is the thing.  Right [MN].
R:  And basically, just hear the other person out, [MN] get their feedback, get their input on what they're saying, um, hopefully they'll have some, uh, facts to back it up on what their saying and, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, I have a -- I ha -- I have a girlfriend who's -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a long term relationship too.  We've been boyfriend, girlfriend for the last five years and been dating, uh, for like a year before that and we are thinking about, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- settling down with each other.  Just for paying bills off.  But we do have like --
L:  Just for paying bills?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow, that's -- th- [MN] you know, well, I don't know.  [NOISE] On a friendship basis you mean?  Not as a -- or do you mean as an intimate couple?
R:  W- w- -- um, w- we're totally, um, serious towards each other.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's totally monogamous.  Totally, we're -- we're just -- we -- we --
L:  But what a --
R:  -- don't seek other people.
L:  -- strange reason just to pay the bills.  That doesn't sound very romantic.
R:  No, no, w- w- we're trying to pay the bills --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- first before we get married. 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Be- be- because we -- we have, um, our separate bills that we pay, and we're trying to get a house.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Th- that's wh- -- I should have said that earlier.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, w- we're trying to get a house so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right now w- we're, um -- we're gonna set a date in the next couple of weeks [MN] but, um, as far as like opinions go, [LIPSMACK] um, she has different opinions than mine and I have different opinions, [MN] um, than hers.  Um, like on certain topics and discussions but we both remain calm and cool and collected and not really like blow our tops and, uh, we're for- very much, uh, rational people who are just, uh, respect each other's opinions.
L:  [NOISE] Right, because, um, in a lifelong partner, you don't need a partner who bears grudges, [NOISE] you know, and -- and -- and sort of hates you because you feel one way and they feel the other way.  [NOISE] Um, I'm just trying to get back to the lifeline p- the life, uh, I -- I find this a very, very difficult topic for some unknown reason.  [NOISE] Uh, maybe because I haven't found a lifetime, [NOISE] um, partner.  So, what do you think about age differences?  A man being much older than a woman or a woman being much older than a man?  How do you think?  [MN] [MN] [MN] Do you think, um, that that can work out in -- in certain circumstances?  Or do you think that there's no -- no real hope for a couple like that?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, to me age is n- is a [inaudible] because I'm twenty nine and she's twenty three so I'm like six years ahead of her but, um, it doesn't really matter to me.
L:  Well, that's not much of an age difference but supposing you were forty?  Well, you don't know because you're not forty.  But, um, I don't know.  I was just wondering because, you know, there is certain famous people, who, uh, the man is maybe twenty, thirty years older and they recently got married and then there's somebody in the news now who is an older woman whose boyfriend is [MN] [MN] twenty or thirty years younger --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I just wondered if they had any future or there's just a -- well, with the marriage, uh, thing and the birth of the child in the actor's case, that probably will last.  But I guess the other one is just a fling, you know.  You know, just variety.  Just something to spice up.
R:  It's just matters if -- if you can make the other person happy.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  It's just, um, basically, um, if he -- if each other -- if each person's happy then, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE] Then age shouldn't matter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm. Mm.
R:  Age is only a number.  [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] This is a long ten minutes it seems to me.  [NOISE] [LAUGH] Usually I get so involved in the -- in the thing that they say, "Your time is up" and I haven't, you know, really but as I say -- I -- I -- I really don't have a lot to say about lifetime partners.  [NOISE] Only because I can only ch- use other people as an example, not myself, so I can't speak from personal experience.
R:  Well, I find my -- my, uh [LIPSMACK] -- my girlfriend to be absolutely wonderful and, um, she does a lot for me and I do a lot for her, um sh- --
