L:  Hi, my name's Faye.
R:  I'm Christie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Well, what do you think about what did they say five twenty five?  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, yes, five fifty or five twenty five or something.  Um, I don't really think that's enough for a minimum wage.  [LAUGH]  That's not really much money at all, uh, to be making to live off of.
L:  No, we can't live off of it.
R:  No, definitely not.
L:  Definitely cannot live off of that kinda wage.
R:  Mhm.  'Cause I live -- I live alone.  I just have me to support and I couldn't support myself off of that, like let alone if I had a family.
L:  No.  Yeah, but, you know, most -- most of the jobs that are -- are minimum wage you either take 'em because maybe you're in school or, you know, you're taking to just make -- make some extra money.  But I'm -- you know, I'm sure there are some people that are -- that are all around that do have just minimum wage jobs.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, I mean, you know, they're usually pretty unskilled.  So, I mean, you know, like I have a master's degree and -- in the pro- -- teaching profession.  I mean, some college graduates are starting out on what I -- what I'm making now after almost thirty years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it just depends upon, you know, how well valued the profession is.
R:  Yeah.  It's weird --
L:  Yeah.  Some ...
R:  -- how that happens.  [COUGH]
L:  I mean, you're talking about minimum wage would be grocery stores, fast food restaurants.
R:  Yeah.  I guess a lotta service jobs maybe, like, um -- like --
L:  Drug stores.
R:  -- retail clerks or something.
L:  Yeah, a clerk.  Clerking in a store.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Something like that.  But, you know, you ...
R:  I just couldn't understand how anyone could live off of that 'cause that's four -- four times five is twenty, that's like before taxes about two hundred dollars a week --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for forty hours.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's ridiculous.
L:  You know, eight what -- it's two hundred dollars a week, eight hundred dollars a month.
R:  Yeah, before taxes and then you have to pay rent and buy food.
L:  So, you can't rent a place.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it takes more than one person.  I mean, you have -- minimum wage is, like I said -- you know, it's like maybe a kid that's going to college.
R:  Yeah.  I guess for that, I mean, I've definitely had minimum wage -- wage jobs and at the time I didn't think it -- I thought it was a lot of money at the time.  [LAUGH]  I was like wow, I'm making money, this is great.  But now that I'm older I couldn't imagine.
L:  Yeah.  So, that's -- yeah, you know?  It's not really enough, not for anybody that's gonna be using it for their main income.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Definitely --
R:  Definitely not.
L:  -- would not be enough.  But, you know?  [SIGH]  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, are we willing to pay for those higher wages because it's gonna be reflected in the prices of our hamburgers and how much we pay for our motel rooms or how much our groceries cost or how much the prices are at Wool Mart?
R:  Yeah.  But, I mean, I don't know.  I'm just thinking that ...  Hello?
L:  Yeah, I'm still here.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, that -- that if, uh -- you know, would the people be happier to work there 'cause I go into C.V.S.  Do you have C.V.S. drugstores?
L:  Yeah, we do, but I don't usually go there.
R:  Oh, okay.  I go in there and the people just look so bored and every time I go in there they just like are staring into space and just I'm sure they make minimum wage because it's -- I don't know.  I mean, not that -- I don't know if like giving them more money would make them more satisfied with their job or if it's just a really boring job, you know?
L:  Well, it might make them more, um -- I think you pay for what you get, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if someone's getting a better pay for their job then they probably do better service.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I mean, have you ever noticed that when you go into, um, some -- like -- like, um, I do some mystery shopping on the side where you go in and rate a store and stores that I go to, like grocery stores or, you know, shops in the mall and stuff like that the guys there -- and they're not -- you know, they're not real concerned about the customer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, they're talking on the phone to their girlfriend or the girl's talking on the phone to her boyfriend or they're talking to each other or one of their friends has stopped by --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and you've got all that kinda stuff going on.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know -- I don't know and, yeah, maybe if you -- if you pay more you could expect more.
R:  Yeah, I guess so.  Like when I go into nicer shops the people are more accommodating.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, usually they're -- they might have a minimum -- a minimum salary, but they're also working on a commission too.
R:  You know, also I think that a lotta times it just depends on the management too because there's this --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  --  Dunkin' -- there's a Dunkin' Donuts by my work and I go in there a lot just because whoever runs that place is a genius because everyone who works there is -- is just like always cleaning and working and just like "Hello.  How are you doing?  What would you like?".  Just like get -- get you your whatever -- croissants, um, you know, and it's -- you know, that's that and they seem to enjoy their job, they laugh and talk when, um -- you know, when no one's in the store.  Like when I first walk in they're talking to each other but then, you know, they stop and -- and it's -- I don't know -- who -- they're -- they're probably making minimum wage.  But they all seem very happy there.  So, it's prob- ...
L:  I think that that plays into it too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, um, the management can make a big difference in a place.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A big difference, you know? 
R:  Definitely.  'Cause then there's this other coffee shop.  I don't know if you know -- like it's a chain up here called Cozy, but they ...
L:  No, we don't have those here.
R:  Okay.  It's this like coffee shop.  It's kinda trendy.  And you go in there and you basically stand in line for like a couple of minutes and you'll be the only person in line and people are just standing around staring at you [LAUGH] and it's just ridiculous.  I've -- I've stopped going in there, but ...
L:  So, like, uh, yeah, I think management can make a big difference too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But all I can say is I'm glad I don't have to go out and look for a minimum wage job.
R:  Me too.  Yeah.  Me too.
L:  No way.  I can spend two hundred dollars in one day let alone --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, in a whole week.
L:  -- get that for a whole week.  Oh, well ...
R:  I know because I -- now that I think about it when I was in high school and like the summers during college I would be working minimum wage jobs and I was living at home.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I wasn't paying rent and I still really didn't have that much money [LAUGH] like now that I think about it.  Like once I paid for my gas or, you know, food and going out with my friends that's not so much.
L:  No.  And kids, you know -- a kid starting out who hasn't, you know, really got much of an allowance or anything they go to work and they've got all this money, but they're living at home, Mom and Dad are helping out with different things and they take care of their medical, they pay their car insurance if they've got a car, you know, they pay the car insurance on the family car, they -- you know?  So, the kid's buying gas and -- and doing that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But when you go out to, you know, work and live on your own oh, well [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's different.
R:  Definitely.
L:  That's -- no, that's not a good wage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't think to live off of.
R:  It's not.
L:  It might be -- you know, I've thought about sometimes taking a -- a second job that might be, you know, start out at the minimum wage, but just as a, you know, temporary basis, you know, to -- you know, to help out on my other income and pay some bills off or something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But not to live off of.
R:  No.  No.  No.  No.
L:  [PAUSE] I don't know.  So, you have anything else you wanna say about this topic?
R:  [LAUGH] Not really.  Um, where are you --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- where are you from?
L:  Uh, Florida.
R:  Florida.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
R:  I live, um -- I'm from Virginia, but I live in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yes.
L:  Big town.
R:  Yes.  I like it here a lot.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, I live close to Tallahassee, but out in the country.
R:  Yeah.  I think I've been to Tallahassee before out camping or something, or around Tallahassee.  I think that's where -- that's in the, um, Pan Handle, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I've been out there before.  It's nice.
L:  Actually it's been lousy for the last two weeks though.
R:  Raining?
L:  Yeah, like every day.
R:  That's how it has been here too.  It didn't rain yesterday, but it's completely pouring right now and it has been for a long time.
L:  All it's been doing here is pouring and pouring and pouring.
R:  Yeah.  We didn't really get a spring [LAUGH] at all.
L:  Well, we had, um -- we had a lotta rain in our early spring, then it totally dried up for a month and now we're back to raining every day.
R:  Yeah.
