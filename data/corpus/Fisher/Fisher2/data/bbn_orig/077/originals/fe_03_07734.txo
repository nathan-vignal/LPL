R:  Hello.  My name is Calvin from Los Angeles.
L:  Yes, hello, this is Kelly from Dallas.
R:  Ah -- 
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay.  It's kind of cloudy out here and, ah, they say the minimum wage is five fifteen.  I think California is, ah, oh, at least six twenty five, six -- 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- fifty.  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's higher out there?
R:  Yeah.  The st- -- 
L:  Yeah, I didn't realise it was at -- it was only five fifteen.  Gosh, that's low.
R:  I mean, how can you live [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Really.  How -- 
R:  -- on that?
L:  I mean, it's just sad that people work so hard every day to bring home and then after taxes and stuff there's just -- and there's no telling what they bring home especially out there in California even six fifty's still low.
R:  Right, well, you know, ah, certain of the, ah, cities, like Los Angeles have what they call a living wage, ah, for city employees that work at the airport or something like that and that's pretty good.  I think that's almost up to ten dollars.
L:  Oh, because they've a- a- averaged out how much they think it would cost them to live.
R:  Yeah.  Which -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, is a sensible thing because, ah, Los Angeles is quite high including the rents and the gasoline and all that.  I -- 
L:  Yeah.  Have you lived there a long time?
R:  Well, I have lived here since about eighty eight and -- 
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, wow.
R:  -- and are -- are you a native of Dallas. 
L:  Um, I am.  I, oh, um, lived in Dallas and then I moved to Austin with my family and then, um, I'm here with my -- we're trying to get back to Austin.  We love -- have you been -- 
R:  Oh, Austin -- 
L:  -- to Austin?
R:  -- is great, you know?
L:  Yeah, we love Austin.  That's our -- both my parents and my husband's parents are both there so we're trying to get back there and -- 
R:  Do you think the minimum wage is really that low, five fifteen? [LAUGH] -- 
L:  I -- I guess.  You know, I didn't know and they -- when she said the topic of the day is the minimum wage I thought, "Well, gosh, I don't even know what the minimum wage is" but, um, I mean, I know my sister, she's at college too.  She's graduated college and she's trying to, um, find a job and yeah, most of the, you know, starting salaries and stuff are, you know, twelve and thirteen dollars so -- 
R:  That's in Dallas, twelve or thirteen?  Yeah --  
L:  In Austin, yeah.  And -- and well she thought, like, that was so low so I can't even imagine five dollars.
R:  Well, [MN] she has a college education, I guess, right?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, she's just graduated.  So -- 
R:  But, it's hard to get a job now.  They -- they were saying that, ah, you know, I was reading in the newspaper people used to be get -- coming out and getting fifteen dollar an hour jobs but I don't think that's the case anymore.
L:  Yeah, no -- 
R:  Because, ah, people -- you know, it seems to me that, ah, companies are firing or, you know, down sizing by, ah, cutting, of course, the people that have been there the longest because they get the most money.
L:  Right.
R:  And then they want to hire at the lowest [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Level.
R:  -- level.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's cheaper.  But, I think in the long run it's, ah, penny wise and pound foolish because all those people that may have been there for ten or twenty years have a lot of experience and knowledge, you know?
L:  Right, and they're -- yeah -- 
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  -- right, versus, you know they -- 
R:  What -- ah, what is your sister trying to get?  What kind of a job?
L:  Well, s- -- um, actually now Nordstroms is building a new Nordstroms in Austin and so she is interviewing for that.
R:  And they will offer her twelve dollars you think, ah -- 
L:  Well, I don't know what they're offering.  I think they're, um -- they say -- I mean, from what it looked like, you know, on their website and in the paper they had a pretty good, um, offer.  But, she hasn't gone for the interview, it's Saturday.  So, she's just going to wait and see.  Um, she got a business degree but she hasn't really done anything.  A lot of these jobs now, like these sales jobs, are a hundred percent commission so, gosh. 
R:  And no benefits.
L:  And no benefits.  Oh.
R:  I think Nordstrom has good benefits so that's -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- where the minimum wage -- if you come in and you can get some benefits -- 
L:  Yes, some good health insurance.
R:  -- you know, it's worth -- it's worth k- -- you know, if I was offered and I'm retired actually but I'm offered -- you want to get in on the ground floor.  You know, you can go in and see what happens and then --  
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can prove yourself but, um, gee it's -- it -- you're talking five fifteen.  Let me see.  If you're working a forty hour a week and then of course, ah, all -- it's not only the taxes, you know, but it's the social security and -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then we have the unemployment so -- five point one five.  Okay, just -- that's two hundred and six dollars.  That's ridiculous. 
L:  Yeah, a -- a week.
R:  For a forty -- for a forty hour a week, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, and you have to pay the, ah, social security tax and then the workers comp and all that other stuff so it's not what you would call a living wage, I think.
L:  No.  I mean, I can see minimum wage more like, you know, if you're a high school student, you know, working at a- -- you know, just a convenience store or something.
R:  That's right.  Well, you know, ah, they -- there've been a lot of articles in the paper out here about people that had really good jobs and then they're fired, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, they maybe analysts for, ah, you know, ah, securities companies or what have you and they try to get jobs at the entry wage and they've got to sort of lie about their background because people see that you've earned a lot before, they say, "Well, you're not going to last" you know, "You're not going to stay on the job".  But, a lot of these people really need to work. 
L:  Right.
R:  And it's frightening because I hear that, ah, [MN] ah, people that, ah, graduate -- I heard a statistic the other day and I don't know if it really is true but they say so many can't get jobs they're moving back with their parents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah, my sister's not at that point yet but I -- my parents have mentioned that and she said -- 
R:  Really?  Oh, boy.
L:  -- but she says, "No.  [LAUGH] --" 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- No, please".  [LAUGH] --" 
R:  But, she has a -- she has a business degree, right?  So -- 
L:  Yeah, so she's had a couple of little things, you know, but she's just kind of -- you know, she's just graduated like a few weeks ago so she want's to kind of see.  Um, and my husband, he just got his deg- -- masters and we're hoping to get back to Austin but -- 
R:  Well, Austin's a beautiful city because it's got a downtown.  [LAUGH] It's got a life, you know?
L:  Right.  But -- 
R:  Ah -- 
L:  -- I hope -- like what you say about lying about your experience I kind of almost thought my husband may have to do that because -- 
R:  What's his master's degree in?
L:  In finance, um, but -- 
R:  Oh.
L:  -- right now he's, um, yeah, like the worst one.  Right now he's in technical sales and so, um, you know, ah, but definitely we've seen a downturn but so I don't know.  We're just hoping to get there and we're trying to, you know, keep +an open mind about it and you know, he may not get the best job, we'll [inaudible] when we get there until, you know, the market turns around but, um, you know, I do things like this and [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Yeah, I know.  Well, that's what -- 
L:  -- you know, what -- 
R:  -- we're all doing and stuff.  Well, that's the other thing you might tell your sister.  There are a lot of, um, jobs for alumni of universities, like, UCLA out here.  They always, ah, hire alumni or students to talk to alumni about fundraising and stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, they were advertising nine seventy five an hour -- 
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- you know?  And the thing about that it's completely flexible, ah, in terms of your time.  So, if you want to work at night, because that's when most of these things go on, you know, ah, cold calling, you call at night so that you could be out during the day hunting around things.  But, if you're make -- making nine seventy five a night, you know -- 
L:  Yeah, at least it's something.
R:  -- even for five hours it's better and it's quite flexible and -- and, ah, they want people that are really graduates of the university so they -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- know and they can relate to the people and so forth.  So, that -- you know, I'm just suggesting that might be an idea.
L:  Yeah, just some kind of odd jobs that -- 
R:  Yeah, you -- 
L:  -- can -- 
R:  -- know that give you the flexibility, ah, of that and as I say, nine seventy five is certainly better than the minimum wage -- 
L:  Yeah, and then -- 
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- find something.
R:  And you're sitting down.  You're not doing physical stuff.  You're talking on the phone, you know, um, but that's -- that's pretty frightening.  Um, and you've got a -- you have parents in Austin?
L:  Yes, my parents and then my, um, husband's parents are both there so --  
R:  Oh, okay.  So, if you needed to you could stay with them temporarily. 
L:  Yeah, yeah, we could.  I -- um, we have a two year old too so I don't know how long we could stay [LAUGH] with them -- 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [several inaudible words]
R:  Well, as I say, they said something like sixty percent of the -- of the graduates.  Now, how about, ah, you know, if you graduated from a business school, ah, out here at least, you know, people like Arthur Lee Anderson are not hiring or, you know, they cherry pick and just take ten or twenty instead of fifty or a hundred people.  Did they have any kind of, ah, ah, gatherings for, ah, graduating students?
L:  You know, they do.  But, they're so driven towards Dallas jobs.  Dallas really does have some jobs but, see, we're trying to g- go to Austin.
R:  Ah, yeah -- 
L:  So, they don't have a very good recruiting program down there.  Um, so I could get -- I see emails all the time for jobs in Dallas but nothing in Austin. 
R:  And that's the problem.  Well, do you happen to know what wages they offer on -- on those jobs?
L:  Like, how much the salary?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  He said, when he --
