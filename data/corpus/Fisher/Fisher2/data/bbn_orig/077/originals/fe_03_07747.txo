R:  Elizabeth.
L:  Dana.
R:  Hello. [LAUGH]
L:  Hi.
R:  I haven't done this before so I don't know what I ought to do.
L:  Okay.  Well I think we're just supposed to be talking on the topic of --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- minimum wage and if we think that is sufficient.  Um ...
R:  I don't.
L:  -- uh, at five dollars and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- fifteen cents an hour. [LAUGH]  I don't know -- of course that's not --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- sufficient.
R:  No, it's not.
L:  No.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, when you think about -- especially about women working minimum wage jobs making five fifteen an hour, um, there's no way they could support a family on that.
R:  No, it's not.  And even when they're waitresses they don't completely make up to the five fifteen an hour --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they get their tips.
L:  Right.  Absolutely.
R:  Leave me alone for a minute.
L:  So no, I certainly don't think that that's a sufficient --
R:  No, it's just --
L:  -- minimum wage, uh, you know, for anyone.  And I -- I also don't think paying five fifteen an hour that the employer is probably getting the best quality of work.
R:  Of course not.
L:  No.
R:  More call ins, if they can, 'cause people don't, I mean, wanna work for fif- five fifteen, they can go to McDonald's and make more money than that.
L:  Right.  Absolutely.  I -- I think the only people it probably is sufficient for are teenagers who are in, um, high school or in college.
R:  Yeah, pay for books, something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  But still it's l- long hours to be working for five fifteen.
L:  Yes it is.  But you know what?  It has -- it has dramatically increased.  I'm thinking back to the times when I was working for minimum wage when I was in high school and, um, I -- I know when I started I was making three seventy five an hour and that was minimum wage.
R:  You're definitely older than I am then! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  'Cause it was like, four something -- four fifteen, four seventy five, what was it?  When I was working.
L:  Yeah.  And I remember thinking, actually, that that was a fortune --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at that point.  And I was fifteen when I started working.  And I remember it -- it -- it -- raising somewhat, you know, throughout the years but, um, you know, after I went to college that that wasn't an issue.  But I -- I mean, I can certainly understand that in -- I guess I think that the minimum wage being --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- five fifteen an hour really contributes to a lot of social problems that we have as well.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And that's that I think if people can't support themselves and their family on their income then they're gonna turn to, um, to various criminal activities to support themselves.  They're gonna supplement their income by selling drugs, by stealing, um, and by prostitution.
R:  [MN] [inaudible] later.  Okay.
L:  And I know this to be true because I worked in a prison, um, for the last five and a half years.  And that's what we frequent -- frequently saw there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With women, w- you know, it was a -- it was a women's state prison and, um, what we worked with there were women who just couldn't support their families because they weren't educated, they didn't have the same opportunities and many of them are minorities and the same opportunities just were not available for them.  And so they work in jobs like housekeeping, you know, McDonald's, fast food, that paid minimum wage and -- and they just couldn't do it.
R:  No.  A lotta people can't.  I mean, I don't know how m- a lot of my family live with -- I mean, they work at gas stations and they've been there for ten years and they're not even making what I make now.  I just don't know how they do that.
L:  Mm.
R:  There -- there's -- of course there's three of 'em in the house but still all of 'em work in a -- a minimum wage.  It's just impossible to live and work like that.
L:  Right, absolutely.  But I think the problem though is that if they raise minimum wage and they start paying the employees more, then the cost to everyone else for their products will go up.
R:  Probably.
L:  That's the dilemma.  But if we wanna keep prices reasonable then pay the workers minimum wage.  And on the other hand, if they can't afford to support themselves they're gonna be, um, they're gonna end up in prison and other places where we end up out of our tax dollars supporting them anyhow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's definitely a -- a social problem.  And although it's increased somewhat, you know, five fifteen, I mean, when I think about five dollars and fifteen cents an hour and my family now and trying to support my family on that, that's crazy.
R:  [SIGH] If --
L:  We're making more money for this ten minute phone call [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- than they make! [LAUGH]
R:  Say, you're good at this, aren't you?  You like to talk! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I -- [MN] just -- I just came back from Kr- -- Mike[?] Kroger[?] and I would say with them making the money that that -- that they make, they're not very nice people either.  They can be very rude.
L:  Oh absolutely.  But, you know what?  I -- maybe I'd be rude too if I were, you know, working long hours for minimum wage.
R:  For m- -- yeah.  And they have to.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  G- um --
L:  It's not --
R:  I say I've been lucky with my jobs, I've never made the minimum wage, I've always made more than the minimum wage, so ...
L:  Yeah, I really haven't since I was -- I was in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- high school and college and I was working my way through there.  And, um, but -- but since then I've been very fortunate and I haven't been in that situation ... where I've had to do that.  I can do things like this to supplement my income on the side. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] This and the coupon clipping.
L:  It's very -- it's difficult to talk for ten minutes on these topics, isn't it?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So I'm thinking, it's, uh, been four minutes? [MN]
L:  Uh, maybe, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm standing or sitting here trying to type a letter.  I was sitting here trying to type a letter when the phone came in, so [MN] yeah.
L:  [MN] So th- these calls came out randomly then?  You didn't call me?
R:  No, they come in randomly.
L:  Oh I see, okay.
R:  Right.
L:  Well I know you have the option of placing the phone call yourself.
R:  Yeah.  I'd -- I've haven't had the chance to do that yet. [SIGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well, I -- I hope they're not listening to the content and, um --
R:  [NOISE] No!
L:  -- going to [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- pay us based on that!
R:  I know!
L:  'Cause I am just outta conversation about the minimum wage [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's rough to work like that.  I would just -- I don't -- I don't know.  M- -- I know my mom, when she babysat she could make more money babysitting than going out and getting a real job, I know my Mo- --
L:  Oh sure.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, my dad worked --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's what she did to supplement more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then she stayed home to watch us, so that they could afford it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, for myself right now, I'm an Ebay seller so I make far more than minimum wage, um, at what I'm doing.  I quit my job, I was actually a psychologist at the state prison and quit to sell on Ebay because it actually pays more than my state prison job did and I'm able to stay home.  But I -- oh, I wouldn't wanna go back to those days of working at McDonald's and working at Aim's[?] and working at the places that -- although I have to say I loved working in retail and, um, but they just don't pay enough.
R:  They don't.  I've never -- I can honestly say I've never had the option of working in a fast food restaurant or a retail, I've always had office work because of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  My mom was able to teach me what she kno- -- what she knew and passed it on down to me and that's how I stayed in the office setting to make the more money.
L:  Well that's definitely very fortunate.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can remember --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- at my minimum wage job, leaving with the -- we wore visors at McDonald's at the time -- and leaving, um, with a ring around my head! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where the grease, it kinda got in your hair! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  I would never work in a -- I -- I hate --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- food, I could -- I mean, working with food, I could see me working in a fast food --
L:  Right.
R:  -- restaurant, uh-uh.
L:  And it -- you know, I -- I -- I truly believe that, um -- we actually just got back from vacation in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area and, um, I -- I can -- you can look around and see who's making minimum wage and, you know what?  They don't give a crap! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They don't.  [SIGH]  I was just amazed in that area at the McDonald's and some of the grocery stores and the Walmart and some of the other places that we just ran into quick, at, um, the attitudes of the people working there and, um, I mean, it's very obvious what places they're paying minimum wage to their employees.  I mean, they're not getting good service, they're not getting -- they're not getting good quality work out of these people.
R:  They're not.
L:  The store was filthy and, um, I mean, you can just look around and see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, that if they paid them a little bit more and offered better benefits and didn't try to hire -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the other things that employers are doing today is trying to hire everyone on a part time basis instead of a full time basis, 'cause then they don't have to pay the benefits.
R:  Of course, and then, you know, I mean, that's outrageous 'cause even if me at my level, it's outrageous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially for a family. [SIGH]
L:  Yep, that really is.  And like I said, I d- -- I don't know what the answer is for it and, um, it's definitely a problem that's larger than our ten minute phone call.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]  I don't think there'll ever be a -- a solution to it 'cause you mean, I just -- I guess I've always wondered why if we can make our own money why can't we make enough money?
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] With the, you know.  I just don't understand all that stuff I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really, I suppose this is better than, um, you know, my sister's been doing this too and she had to talk for ten minutes on bio terrorism.
R:  I refused that call.
L:  Oh you did? [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I did! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I said, "Oh, I'll be darned".  I said, "I'm not sure I could have a ten minute conversation on that". [LAUGH]
R:  Me either.  Th- -- I know that, I said, "Uh-uh".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  [SIGH] I suppose that -- that the minimum wage -- in fact, I never -- I did not realize, I have to say, that the minimum wage was five fifteen right now.  I kinda lost track of that when I stopped working at minimum wage jobs, I didn't realize that that's what it was.
R:  Well, when I first, uh, started working in the office setting I was making five dollars an hour.  And I knew when it had changed to that, five fifteen, and I still, because I was part time, I mean, I just worked there after school to help out my mom, th- they didn't move me up to the minimum wage.
L:  Ah.
R:  So I've -- I've always kinda kept track of it, I don't know why, but --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- just I guess so I always know.
L:  Hm.
R:  Now, I know it's been nine
