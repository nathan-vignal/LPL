L:  My name is --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- Joyce.
R:  Hi, my name is Pam Pullman.
L:  Hi, how you doing?
R:  Pretty good.  How are you doing?
L:  [LAUGH] I'm pretty good.
R:  [NOISE] And what was your name again?
L:  My name is Joyce, I'm in California.
R:  I'm in Colorado.
L:  Oh, well that's pretty cool.
R:  Um --
L:  So how -- how do you draw the line with your comedy?
R:  Well, [SIGH] I'm probably a pretty [NOISE] -- I like different types of comedy.  I'm not a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  There is not anything that's particular. [NOISE]  It seemed like for the longest time I liked to watch like, if you got the -- the comedy sitcom or -- not sitcom -- the standup comedy that would be advertised on TV from time to time.  [NOISE]  Just various things.
L:  Yeah.  I'm pretty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, I have three kids so I'm pretty, you know, I'm -- I'm pretty --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- relaxed, I'm not, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, like, real particular and there's like, well, there's almost hardly anything that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to where you have to draw the line unless it's obscene.
R:  D- I think when -- when things get to be racial [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or --
L:  Well, that's not a good [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [MN] That's -- I mean, because it starts to be kinda -- or the language.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  When the language starts to get pretty fierce it's -- it just becomes -- I know we used to watch a lot of the -- the comedy shows and stuff like that, but when the language would get bad we'd just have to change the channel or something because I've got kids in the house and I don't wanna hear that.
L:  Yeah, you don't want 'em hearing that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, I have a son who likes [MN], um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, I have a teenager --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then I have two smaller kids, um, ages five and eight, and my teenager likes to watch South Park.
R:  Oh gosh.
L:  [LAUGH] And so, you know, I mean, he's gonna be seventeen in a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- couple of months, so I let hi- -- I'll let him watch it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but I don't want the other kids watching it, you know, like, h- he needs to be in his own room with the door closed and --
R:  [NOISE] That's it, right there.
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  'Cause it's --
L:  -- I won't like a [LAUGH] --
R:  -- too adult for little ears.
L:  Yeah, like way -- like way too adult. [LAUGH]  I -- and I do, you know, I mean, I heard that -- on TV that it was controversial and stuff but I never, you know, I never watch it so I never really paid attention, and then one day he -- he was watching it and I ended up walking into the room and the little kids weren't there but, you know, it was the first time I heard it and I couldn't believe what they were saying.
R:  [NOISE] It --
L:  I mean, it was -- some of it was funny like, for an adult, but there's no way I would want my kids hearing it, at all.
R:  [NOISE] Definitely.  [NOISE]  There's a lot I think out there that we think is acceptable but you gonna -- once you start listening to it you realize, this is not really for kids.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words].
R:  But, I mean, I don't know, even personally I don't like to hear, [NOISE] you know, you get one or two jokes with a couple of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things and it's not that bad but [MN] at a -- at a certain point it's like, this is just a little bit much.  'Cause I know -- I mean, we went to Las Vegas and did -- and heard some standup comedy and some of it, it was just kinda like, at one point we're going, "I'm not sure that we should even be sitting here anymore".
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause it's not even really funny anymore when the language starts getting a little outta control.  And I -- I don't know, I haven't heard too much racial stuff.  The only time I've ever really heard any racial stuff is usually when it's come from black people against white people.
L:  Yeah, yeah, like the other way around.
R:  Mhm.  Trying to do a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- reverse discrimination kinda thing.
L:  Yeah, I -- I've -- I've kinda seen some of that before.  I was listening to a radio show yesterday, um, Richard Jenny was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, they were interviewing him and I guess he's a -- he's a standup comic and he s- -- he said a few racial things but they were, um, it wasn't too bad.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, like he just -- he was just -- he was talking about an experience he had when he was doing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, uh, his standup show and he made --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a joke, um, about flying on airplanes.  And he -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he said that he just wanted, you know, like, "If -- if there's somebody out there that wears a turban, just don't do it on my flight, 'cause I don't wanna be nervous" you know?  And he was saying how -- how much hate mail he got.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] You know, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he was just saying he go- --
R:  Well, it's kind of --
L:  -- he says --
R:  I don't know, y- --
L:  "I'm not saying I have anything against 'em".  He goes, "I'm just saying that, you know, with everything that's happened, uh, you know, like that doesn't mean that everybody's a terrorist that has a turban, but I just, you know, that's something that would make me nervous". [LAUGH]
R:  It would [MN] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I don't know, it's funny 'cause it seems like sometimes people say something, thinking they're funny --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then it's not.
L:  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
R:  It's like they're -- they're trying to be funny or make a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- joke of a serious situation and it's not.
L:  Mhm.  Well, that's what I, you know, what I thought was funny was that the producer of the show got -- you know, the radio show -- got on and he said, "Go to Richard Jenny dot com because I [several inaudible words]" you know!
R:  [SIGH]
L:  He goes, "Nobody here said that".
R:  Said that right there.  Disclaimer!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I [inaudible] --
R:  The opinions of those speaking --
L:  Yeah, I [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- do not necessarily reflect the management.
L:  Yeah, right away he said, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you know.  So --
R:  Well, it is because people are very touchy about that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I could see, you know, 'cause every -- there is so many different, you know, there's so many -- just like Hispanic, there is like, so many different kinds of -- of Hispanics [NOISE] they're -- and they're all, you know, they're not all the same. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know.  In -- it's just like saying, you know, like, all -- all white people don't know how to dance.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's like it's not entirely true, it's --
R:  It's the stereotypes.
L:  Yeah, it depends on the person, and so none of that is pretty good and I definitely don't like [several inaudible words].
R:  Well, I think -- what was the funniest thing we were talking about is some of the stereotypical jokes.  My dad told me -- I remember some of the blonde jokes that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- circulate around.  It used to be they were Texas Aggie jokes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  From the Texas A&M High School, you used -- they used, to -- or college -- they used to make fun of the -- the college kids that went out there because they weren't necessarily the brightest on the block.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he said almost every blonde joke that he's heard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- used to be a Texas A&M joke once.
L:  Yeah, they make the rounds.
R:  Or it was a Polack joke or it was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's like the same joke, you just change the nationality of whoever.
L:  Yeah.  I remember somebody forwarded me an email --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- once and I actually laughed because it was, uh, uh, the title was, Something to Offend Everyone.
R:  Oh, I think --
L:  They just --
R:  -- I've seen that one.
L:  Yeah, they -- well, they went through like, every possible scenario, so nobody would be left out, you know?
R:  That's it.  And, I mean, 'cause, I mean, I --
L:  'Cause like, I mean, how ridiculous.
R:  -- I don't wanna be overly sensitive but at the same time there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there comes a point where you do have to -- I mean, I think to a certain extent we all have to laugh at ourselves.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I g- -- I got two kids [NOISE], I feel like sometimes I'm constantly laughing at myself.
L:  Yeah, well they kinda bring it out more. [LAUGH]
R:  Most definitely.  But, I don't know, it is sometimes -- I know -- my husband's from the east coast, he's from New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when we were first dating and first married there would be certain things that I would joke about [NOISE] and he'd be looking at me like, going, "That's not funny".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and the same thing, I'd -- he'd be joking and I'd be looking at him going, "I don't find the humor in that". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it depends on --
R:  'Cause it --
L:  -- where you were raised and what kind of humor you were exposed to.
R:  Oh, I mean -- I -- and I think, you know, the culture of your family and everything else of what's acceptable and what's not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] It -- it does become quite a -- a touchy situation from time to time 'cause you don't know how people will react.  I mean, something that you think is pretty hilarious ends up being --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something that somebody else doesn't really appreciate.  And vice versa.  [NOISE]
L:  Have -- have you ever seen that -- that, um, that show on MTV called Jackass?
R:  No I haven't.  We don't have cable.
L:  Oh okay.
R:  [MN] About the only time I've ever really watched cable is if we've been in a hotel or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- something like that.  I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- figure that I'd probably watch too much of it if [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, well it's true, it's true, it -- it happens.  My husband was in the marines up until recently and so, you know, he was exposed to, you know, a lotta man humor and a lotta, you know, and all the --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- all -- and all the young, um, young guys were into this show and it's like a spoof show like, where you -- you just go out and do [inaudible] stunts and weird things and see how the people react, like in the public.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And some of it was okay, you know, like it -- it's all right, but, you know, some of it was just dumb and just, you know, like really, really guy -- punky young stuff. [LAUGH]  To where, you know, like, I just didn't wanna see it and didn't have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- any kinda interest in it, you know, and he was just talking about -- well, even he said, you know, he says, "I don't see how they think this is funny".  But, you know, like, thinking, you know, if you were like, a twenty one year old guy, you know, some of that might have been funny.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I -- I think the -- I'm still hooked on stuff like Candid Camera!
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  [SIGH] I mean, because it's -- it's simple, it's straightforward
