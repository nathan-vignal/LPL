R:  Hi, I'm Jackie.
L:  Yes, hi, this is Rose, how are you?
R:  Good thank you.  You said Rose?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.  Have you done this before?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh okay, well I haven't, so this is very interesting. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh well, we just have to do little chit chat. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [MN] So are -- are -- comedy is our [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm not good at knowing how to draw the line. [LAUGH]
L:  Co- -- yes, comedy, uh, uh, uh, draw the line, well, I -- I draw them -- if I'm watching it on TV and it gets outta hand I just leave the room and let the other people watch it. [LAUGH]
R:  Well that's true.  I wasn't even thinking about TV.  You know what happens at work is, uh, a lot of times, you know, people are telling the jokes and then they're off color and I'm like --
L:  Oh [several inaudible words].
R:  -- okay, do you laugh or don't ya? [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  Well, uh --
R:  [SIGH] Even though I don't want to.  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Well, anymore if you don't -- if you are quite, you know, y- you're offended or anything and you're at work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- I find people will stop because they're all afraid of th- this here, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- uh, getting charged with something.
R:  That's probably true.
L:  But, um, I mean, years ago, um, I had bosses would sit there, you know, and make comments and jokes about, uh, uh, they would pick up an issue of, uh, Cosmopolitan or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they would sit there, you know, and -- and -- and, uh, makes jokes about this one's shape and that one.  You don't see that anymore.
R:  That's true.
L:  They -- they don't do that --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- no.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I was in nursing so I was mainly with women, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then when I went into emergency nursing and there were --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot of medics and then I w- -- I was with men, and they're really bad. [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Uh [MN].
R:  But they knew, I don't know why, I don't know why, but they knew that it wasn't something that I cared for, plus I was their boss so I guess they had to be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- more careful. [LAUGH]  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um --
L:  But I -- I mean, I watch like, the Comedy, uh, Channel, sometimes but that's really -- that seems to be really, um, a lot o- -- a lot of um, uh, where I would draw the line.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, a lot of sexual things.
L:  Do you get that channel?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Do you get that channel?
R:  No, we don't.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  M- but --
L:  There was s- -- there was some real, I mean, it's really, um, just what you would come across if you went out to the actual, um, comedy clubs.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And it's, yeah, cursing and everything.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I don't, uh, I mean, I don't watch it that much.  But my son will have it on and I'm really shocked at [MN], you know, the language and all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's like you have your choice, you know, if you don't wanna watch it then ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um -- but if he's watching it and I'm there it's -- yeah, I get embarrassed sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Especially if it's your son I would think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And he doesn't think anything of it 'cause he's --
R:  Huh, I know!
L:  [MN]
R:  Younger people are so different with comedy, I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  I -- I do enjoy like, uh, Seinfeld.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  I -- I think --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I mean, that [inaudible] -- even some of the things on there that could be really offensive, they put it in a cute way.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  And so you -- you -- you see those shows?
R:  Yes.
L:  I think they're cute.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think -- I -- I get a kick out of Seinfeld, I really do.
R:  Yeah.  I like those.  I -- and see, I don't watch a lot of TV, so most of the shows that I would see would be older rerun kinds of things, but when I do turn on at prime time it's -- they -- they have just changed so dramatically.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's really not worth it to me, although sometimes, you know, you're just stretching out after work and you're sitting in front of it and you just sorta sit there, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It doesn't matter what they say and you g- -- you might not like it but I'm too lazy to get up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So you -- you can watch it sometimes just to take your mind off things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But then I don't get like what you were talking about with -- with the channel that you get, it's not all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that dramatically bad.  But I've heard people talk about that kind of stuff so I don't really have a desire to worry about getting the channel.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  But --
L:  It's amazing how it's changed over the years.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  What was considered bad back then is not --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is nothing now.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It's just a -- you know, that's -- that's like, just harmless --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but compared to what they do say in all. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, well I'm --
L:  But I just -- I --
R:  -- I'm fifty six and so I've seen it change quite a bit over time.
L:  Yeah, well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm your age.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Isn't that amazing?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, I just, um, [LIPSMACK] -- and I love to laugh, you know, like when you're around people and everything it's just so relaxing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do that, but the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- some of the stuff isn't as funny to me as when you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I was never into that slapstick stuff like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- with The Three Stooges and stuff.
L:  Well, y- you -- you remember Bob Hope then?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh yeah, those kinds of things I loved. [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- I was telling my kid, you know, he said about -- he said, "Bob Hope!" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, when he had his birthday --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- recently?  I said, "He was one of the best comedians".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that was like, uh, y- you know, that's fun to me, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- enjoyable.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- and -- d- and when you stop and think, he never had anything really dirty or anything in his acts and yet he was so funny.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  And you wonder why people can't laugh at that kinda stuff now.  Maybe they could if they showed enough of it or, you know, I -- I guess whoever produces these shows feels that they have to go this extra mile --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, um, but I don't know, it always made us laugh and I don't think we're a lot --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- different than the --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- younger [LAUGH] generation.
L:  I told -- I told my kid, I said, "I wish I had some, um, some of his taste to show ya", I said, "He was always funny".
R:  Mhm.
L:  I said, "That's one of the best comedians".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And enjoyable to -- to watch and all.
R:  Mhm.  And Red Skelton.  I remember --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my dad, we'd sit there and he would --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just howl, and my dad was a very quiet person, but he would just howl at this, and I got him some, um, tapes of those old ones and, um, [LIPSMACK] this one girl that was there, she was about ten, she just loves them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She'll watch them and really like 'em.  So it can't be that different. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  That's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now that to me is -- is a nice, uh, way of -- of -- of seeing comedy and -- and, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Good -- good comedians and -- and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think like, it started with, um, like, Buddy Hackett, he started --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- bringing it down.
R:  That's right, I forgot about him.
L:  Yeah, he started the downhill --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you wanted downhill or risque then you'd [LAUGH] end up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] the [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I had forgotten all about him, but I know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, my mom and I would talk about, like, we always wanted to go to Las Vegas, which we didn't do, but anyway, my uncle would -- would talk about Buddy Hackett and his shows and we'd always say, "We're not going there" and then my uncle would get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- offended because he -- it was like we would tell him he was bad 'cause he listened to this.  But, um, yeah, I had forgotten all about him. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he was the one that -- that would do the -- the, uh, off color, and I'm -- I guess in person he's pretty bad, you know?
R:  I bet he'd be worse --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like simple things so it's okay.  Um, most of my friends, now that I'm older, you know, we're kinda like on the same wavelength, we don't -- you don't get into having to worry about, "Oh, I'm not gonna listen to this kinda joke or whatever" 'cause they don't do it either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, now my stepson, when he comes, some of those, but he's learned, he's learned they're not what I wanna hear. [LAUGH]  But --
L:  Oh.
R:  But, um, we don't see him a lot so I guess he just doesn't realize initially where he is or whatever and, uh --
L:  Yeah.  With the younger kids too, they're -- they're all doing that and -- and --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- that's in their environment and -- and, you know, what their situation calls for, and so I guess to -- to t- tell them to stop or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you just can't because that's how they're going to be.  It's a shame that -- that the world has to change that way.
R:  I know, I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, well I -- I, um, [LIPSMACK] go on the Internet sometimes and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- look at jokes and there was this one place I went to --
L:  Oh, Joke of the Day or something?
R:  I -- it could be, it's that kind of site, and they have all kinds of jokes but then they have like, X. rated, X. X. rated and so I thought, "Well, I gotta look at this" so I did.  Oh my gosh, I can't believe that they put that on there and anybody can go in.
L:  Ah.
R:  I mean, the kids would be able -- it wasn't a restricted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- site or anything.  But then they had some of the kind, you know, like the knock knock jokes [LAUGH], I just clicked that.
L:  Oh, so they have like, all different levels?
R:  Right.  You could pick --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you could pick.  It's just that they didn't, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- didn't restrict anything, so --
L:  Well, you can imagine, if you're a young kid sitting there and your parents, uh, looking to see what you're doing and they see Joke of the Day and they see a knock knock --
R:  Right!
L:  -- they think it's innocent.
R:  Right.
L:  And then when the parent leaves the room, you go down and look at the triple Xs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So it's --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So the kids are not having any kind of sheltering anymore --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whatsoever, I guess.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK] I know, that's what I think, if I had a young child I'd just -- I don't know what I'd do because I c- -- I would feel bad watching 'em all the time but if they were in those kind of places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'd be yelling at 'em! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah because, um, what they would do see, that the kids do, um, uh, the one -- if -- if the one's computer's restricted they'll go over the house of the other one's.
R:  Oh that's true.  Then they can still -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, you know how kids are always thinking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- so you can't say, well, um, you know, "I don't want you reading these bad jokes" or whatever.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- then the kid'll say, 'Oh, well gee, I won't -- I won't --'"
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  "-- go there, I won't wa- --" and then they, you know, then they go over the other one's and they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  And you're more inclined to do it if they tell you not to, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah.
