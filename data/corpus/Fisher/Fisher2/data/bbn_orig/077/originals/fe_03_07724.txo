L:  Good afternoon.
R:  Hello.  Ah -- 
L:  How are you?
R:  Okay.  My name is Elise, and you?
L:  Mine's Gill.
R:  Hi.  Where are you located?
L:  In, ah, [inaudible], New Jersey.
R:  Oh.  I'm in New York city.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yes.  So, ah, do you want to begin or -- 
L:  Yeah, sure -- 
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that, ah, five dollars and fifteen cents.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Does anybody work for that?
R:  No.
L:  That is ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, I mean that's -- um, nobody can live on that.
L:  No.  Not at all.
R:  And it's an insult to people I feel.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, people do work hard even in menial jobs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They do work hard and -- 
L:  Very much so.
R:  -- and, ah, that's -- especially with, you know, the, ah, costs so high today -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, just for food, just for the basics -- 
L:  Sure.
R:  -- it doesn't go very far and then -- 
L:  No, not at all.
R:  -- and then the taxes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- 
L:  Then when you -- when you did five fifteen an hour and they take off, you know, twenty five or thirty percent in taxes -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's just really ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.  But, it -- I think that's been an increase over the past so they must think that's a little better, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, it was five dollars, ah -- 
R:  Yeah, but it -- it -- it needs to be increased more.  How much do you think it should be increased?
L:  Actually I think minimum wage should be about ten dollars an hour.
R:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, you know, who knows if that would ever happen, I mean -- 
L:  No probably not.  But, most of the, ah, fast food places and things like that are paying seven or eight dollars an hour and, ah, even, ah, janitors, you know, cleaning services and so forth -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the contracts -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're paying seven and eight dollars an hour.
R:  Yeah.  So, ah -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, it -- it's a real problem.
L:  Very much.
R:  And even in -- you know, now with the job situation, I mean, you're in New Jersey and so you're pretty close to New York.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How many people are out of work?
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  And, um, you know, I don't know what could be done.  I guess, you know, there has to be more legislation.
L:  Well, I -- I think people -- one thing they have to figure out, you know, that if they're working, be appreciative of the fact that you're working -- 
R:  That's right.  That's -- 
L:  -- and just -- 
R:  -- just the plus right there.
L:  There's too many people that are working for either five dollars an hour or fifty dollars an hour that aren't doing the job.  Um -- 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  We certainly w- -- you know, there's a thing in the paper this morning or on the news this morning about the IRS people.  Ah, they spend, ah, up to half their time surfing the web on unauthorized sites and personal business.  Now, how many of those people get paid five dollars and fifteen cents an hour?
R:  Right.  [LAUGH] None of them.
L:  They can't. 
R:  No.
L:  You know, they're -- they're working ten, twenty, thirty dollars an hour -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, in -- in the IRS -- 
R:  What kind of -- what kind of work do you do?
L:  Mm?  I'm a security consultant.
R:  So, that's, you know, a -- above the, you know -- that -- that's -- that's a -- a hard kind of job then?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah -- 
R:  Yeah.  As -- 
L:  But, it's a -- 
R:  -- a consultant?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Anything with a consultant.  But, ah -- 
L:  Yeah, as long as you can keep working.
R:  Yeah, you know -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ah, it's -- it's very difficult and, ah, I believe someone wrote a book about this whole s- subject.  Um, ah, Nickels and Dimes.  Somebody went -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- undercover who was really a writer and, ah, she -- she worked, um, you know, for minimum wage all -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- across the country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, I believe her name is Barbara Aronreich[?] -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it was the best seller and she wanted to see, you know, the situation first hand so she was a maid.  She, you know, ah, [MN] --  
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- cleaned rooms and she cleaned bathrooms.  She did -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- menial work and she said she couldn't survive -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- on the pay.
L:  No, not at all.
R:  And, ah, you know, she's, you know, a writer and she -- you know, it was a sociological study.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I don't know what the solution is.  How it would ever, you know, be able to get to, like, ten dollars an hour.  Maybe in private industry, you know, that's more easy to regulate.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, in private -- you know, in corporations and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's, you know, it's -- ah, the majority of people, you know, I -- I would say, you know, do have these kind of jobs.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  One of the things that they're doing -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, to combat the minimum wage is many places that, ah -- or many [SIGH] local government -- when anybody that has a contract with a local government, they're required by contract to pay a living wage, you know, for the -- for the geographical area. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, ah, here in -- in New Jersey.  Ah, the living wage in m- most places, ah, would be about eight and a half or nine dollars an hour.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, that's with certain contracts.
L:  Yes, only those with -- that there are contracts with the, you know, city, county or state.
R:  Right.
L:  So, if -- if -- I -- if I -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  -- have a cleaning company, let's say -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I clean City Hall.  The -- you know, the City Hall, um, the city would dictate to me that I must pay the people at least, ah, eight and a half or nine dollars an hour.
R:  Right.  And I guess that -- that applies to the union jobs.
L:  No.
R:  Well, what about the union jobs?  They don't get five dollars and fifteen cents.
L:  No.  The -- the unions have their own prices and it's more than eight or nine dollars an hour.
R:  Right.  Right.  The union jobs like the government jobs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, ah, it's -- the -- I guess this -- this, ah, menial wage is really for, like, the low paying jobs.
L:  Right.  That are n- non union.
R:  That are non union.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And the -- these people are the poorest people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because the union jobs, you know, are covered, you know, with a higher wage -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a lot of them make their -- you know, thirteen an hour -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fourteen, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  City workers that -- that are unionized and, ah, so -- ah, so this minimum wage really applies to, like, low level workers.
L:  Basic laborers.
R:  Basic laborers who's -- who do a lot.
L:  Yes.  Yeah, they do more work than more of the high paid people.
R:  You know, they -- they, like, lay the foundation -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for, you know, things to go on -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a daily basis like -- 
L:  Right.
R:  -- cleaning and, ah -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, but they're the -- you know, they're the least educated probably.
L:  Well, in most cases, probably.  But -- 
R:  Probably, you know, bec- -- and, ah, well the --  
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- you know, I would s- -- you know, I -- I would, you know, as- assume mostly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because people of a college -- you know, graduates, you know, would not tend to have those kind of jobs.
L:  Correct.
R:  So, mostly, you know -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there may be a few now because of -- you know, but the interesting thing is now with so many [MN] people laid off in -- in -- in white collar jobs -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and advertising and journalism -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and really, you know, um, jobs where they got more.  I've been reading that people are accepting these menial jobs -- 
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in the meantime, you know -- 
L:  Yes, they have to.
R:  -- the -- the people of higher -- you know, who got higher, um, wages are now taking these menial jobs to tide them over in the meantime --  
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, well, because something is better than nothing.
L:  Right.
R:  So, you know, I -- I've been reading about people working, like, in, ah, department stores or, you know, in supermarkets just to get some money.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, you know?
L:  I think one of the -- th- th- th- the real thing has to do, I guess, with, ah, the -- the unions.  Um -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that mentality that -- you know, the union, the way it was meant to be is -- is great -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, in protecting workers' rights.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, they've gone to such an extreme that now if once you join a union, as long as you remain friends with your superiors -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you do -- you don't even have to work.
R:  Really?
L:  And if you do anything wrong you can't even be fired or disciplined.  They're -- they're so many cases of that all over the place and -- 
R:  So -- so you're saying that if a person is a union --
L:  [NOISE] -- 
R:  -- worker they may do little work and still collect their money -- 
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because they're protected by the union.
L:  That's correct.  That's correct.
R:  Well, but -- 
L:  Especially in New York city.  I mean, the -- the -- the big union there, ah, thirty[?] two[?] B.J.[?] um, [NOISE] it's crazy and it's -- 
R:  And what union does that cover?
L:  Ah, all the building services.
R:  Oh, you know because you're security -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's a -- yeah.
L:  You know, all the building services.
R:  Yeah, but don't people -- so what do they do, like jan- -- like, supers and -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- security people?
L:  Yeah, doormen -- 
R:  But, don't -- 
L:  -- janitors.
R:  -- they have a lot to do though?  I mean, wouldn't -- 
L:  The -- 
R:  -- the -- 
L:  -- the jobs entail a lot in -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- most cases.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The problem is they don't do the jobs.  You know, they just goof off.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  My -- my first run in with a union was in nineteen eighty five.  Um, the company I was with took over new, ah, office space.  One of the -- and they remodeled it and of course it was all union labor.  One of the things they forgot to do was to put in, ah, a light switch.  You know, a toggle switch on the -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- wall?
R:  Yeah.
L:  When we -- [MN] it -- well, because the contract had expired, um, the same people wouldn't do it.  They wouldn't come back and finish it.
R:  Right.
L:  So, we went out to get somebody to do it.  You know, it was a company.  But, we had to have a union person.
R:  Yes.  Yeah -- 
L:  Well, what happened was this.  It took ten minutes.  One person to do the job, one person to stand by in case the first person got hurt or electrocuted.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And a supervisor.
R:  Mm.  They all -- 
L:  Each -- 
R:  -- had to get paid.
L:  Each paid two hour minimum which was six dollars -- or six dollars for a ten minute job and the total cost was six hundred and fifty dollars.
