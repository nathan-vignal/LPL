L:  I'm Laura.
R:  Hi, I'm Karen.
L:  Hi, Karen.  Well, I guess we start talking now, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  Um ...
R:  Minimum -- minimum wage is it sufficient?  Is that what the question was?
L:  Yeah.  If it -- if it -- if the -- the pay increase to five dollars an hour is sufficient I guess or was it five fifty.
R:  Five fif- -- I thought it was five fifteen.
L:  Okay.
R:  Uh, is that correct or not?
L:  I think so.  I'm -- I'm so out of it.  I'm complaining about my own husband's salary.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And ...
L:  Um, I think it's only sufficient if they're gonna increase everybody else's pay.
R:  You -- that's the thing.  Um --
L:  You know?
R:  -- it -- it doesn't keep up with inflation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anyway.  So, I -- I don't know, you know, uh, it -- to [MN] -- to tell the truth I don't know if minimum wage matters much, uh, if you go -- drive by the -- the fast food restaurants, you know, they -- you would think that they normally pay minimum wage, but if they really need to hire people it says on there "We're hiring at five fifty an hour.  We're hiring at five seventy five an hour".
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  So, if they need people they'll raise it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  That's what I'm saying.
L:  That's -- I notice that too and -- and with -- if you -- if you look now ...  I mean, for instance, my husband and I we didn't go to college, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that looks bad to begin with and you can only get a job at minimum wage.
R:  Right.
L:  If you've got a job that's starting at minimum wage and you've got a family there's no way in God's green earth you're gonna make it.
R:  It's not gonna happen.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, you can't make ends meet even with two people working.
L:  Right.
R:  There's no way.  There's -- there's absolutely no way and then if you've got kids too, which I do --
L:  So do I.
R:  -- then there's ...
L:  I've got four.
R:  Four.  Well, see, forget it, with two I don't -- I couldn't do it.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I mean ...
L:  Even both -- even if both of us -- and I don't work.  I stay at home.
R:  Mhm.  I work.  Uh, well, I work part time, but I work about twenty five hours a week --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, there's no way.  There's no way.  If we both got minimum wage and we both worked forty hours a week or even fifty hours a week we couldn't pay for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for a sitter and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, everything that's involved.  There's no way.
L:  Exactly.  And so, you know, if they're gonna raise minimum wage make it worth everybody's while and -- and raise it to ten.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I -- well, that -- I guess that's true.  [LAUGH]  Uh, a little bit here and a little bit there isn't gonna do it.
L:  Right.
R:  If -- if that -- if they're trying to get people above poverty -- poverty level, but -- 'cause minimum wage even at five fifteen an hour is pover- -- pover- ...  I can't say that word.
L:  Poverty.
R:  Thank you.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's okay.  I can only say it once in a while too.  No, and that's just it, you know, five fifteen an hour once you take out for taxes and everything --
R:  Oh, yeah, and that's true. 
L:  -- you might as well not be working.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, especially if you're paying for a sitter --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then -- then [LAUGH] you definitely shouldn't bother.
L:  You know, that's ...
R:  It's not gonna do any good.
L:  Five fifteen an hour is not suitable by any stretch of the imagination.  Jeeze, what was it, you know, ten years ago?  It was like four something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The -- the problem is deeper than what minimum wage is.  It's more that the economy it -- you know, inflation --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's going up so much.
L:  And that's not gonna stop.  It's just gonna keep going up.
R:  Right.
L:  And no matter what you do it's gonna keep going up.  So, you have to compensate for that somewhere and the only way to compensate for that is to have pay increases, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and starting on at minimum wage and getting a fifty cent pay increase that's nothing.
R:  It really is nothing --
L:  You know?
R:  -- especially, you know, with the tax situation.
L:  Right.
R:  But ...
L:  You're paying through your nose for taxes, through your nose for a sitter anymore.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I mean, I don't know -- how much are your sitters, uh, when you ...?
L:  I'm -- I'm very lucky in the fact that I get my sisters to baby sit for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, oh, that's good.
L:  You know?  Um, I call them up and I say, you know, "Come -- come baby sit for me" and I hand them twenty bucks --
R:  Right.  Well ...
L:  -- and they're happy with that.
R:  What ...?  Right.  And -- and my kids are school age.  So, you know, I don't need a day care or anything like that.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I'm -- I'm not familiar anymore what day c- care goes for.
L:  Outrageous.
R:  Is it?
L:  It's like a hundred and fifty bucks a week --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for one child.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, see -- and -- but when I do get a sitter for the evening or some -- you -- you know, some afternoon or, you know, a Saturday or something like that, um, I pay five dollars an hour --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so if I were going to work on a Saturday and then had to pay a sitter [LAUGH] ...
L:  You might as well not have worked.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's not gonna -- it's not gonna do it, you know?
L:  Right.  That's why, like I said, I'm fortunate when it comes to -- to baby sitting.  I can get one of my sisters to do it.  Hand 'em the twenty bucks 'cause that covers, you know ...?
R:  Whatever.  However long it took you.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Even if it only -- even if it was two hours or six hours it at least covers their gas money.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And with two college age sisters, two high school age sisters --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and a grade school age brother, you know, 'cause my --
R:  You can find somebody.
L:  -- my brother's old enough to baby sit now, you know?
R:  And he might as well baby sit rather than go take minimum [LAUGH] wage somewhere --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- 'cause of all the taxes that come out of it, you know?
L:  Exactly.  You're better off finding a job working under the table somewhere where you're getting paid cash than -- than getting a job where you have to pay for taxes because minimum wage is just -- it's not high enough.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It really isn't.
R:  And when you're starting that low, you know, it increases -- uh, not minimum wage -- but, you know, if you -- if you're working somewhere for -- for a year, you know, you would expect a pay increase.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- but, what, you get three and a half percent pay increase or something like that, you know?  How much is that gonna be?
L:  Right.
R:  What's it gonna be?  Twenty cents, you know?
L:  Here's a case in point.  My husband.  Every six months they're supposed to get a fifty cent pay increase, not to mention a pay increase for the cost of living.
R:  On top of it?
L:  Right.  Everybody is supposed to get a pay increase for the cost of living, period, end of story.  My husband probably hasn't seen a raise, either part of it, in two years.
R:  [LAUGH] And why would that be?  Just that the economy or the -- or the ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The economy because -- see, and he works for family.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?  So, knowing how the family's doing as far as the business end of it he can't very well go, "You know, I haven't had a raise in two years" whereas a ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  That's right.
L:  Because he knows how it's going.
R:  Right.
L:  If it was any other employer he'd go in there, "I haven't had a raise in two years.  Where is it?" and they'd either give it to him or fire him.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  But with the cost of living, I mean, you're lucky if you can find a house less than two hundred thousand dollars.
R:  Yeah.  Depending on where you live.  That's true.
L:  You know?  Two hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money.
R:  [MN] You're not gonna do it on minimum wage.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  Ever I don't think.
L:  Exactly.  I mean, you're gonna have to be working like a mass of overtime and -- and even still working overtime you're not -- you're ...  Overtime pay is what, time and a half?
R:  Yeah, usually.  But even that's not a lot, you know?  That's what, over seven fifty, but that's still a lot.  How much --
L:  That's still nothing. 
R:  -- how much overtime are you gonna get?
L:  Right.  So, no, they need to do something with minimum wage.  Yeah, it was nice that they had increased it.  But even so, like you said, the fast food places if they need -- they need to hire people they're gonna raise it on their own to get those kids in those doors.
R:  Well, and it's kinda backward anyway.  They're -- everything keeps going up.  The price of everything goes up, goes up, you know, food, grocery bills --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- electricity, gas for the car and, um ...
L:  And that's just ridiculous all on its own.
R:  Well -- well, right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- and so, you know, just trying to keep raising minimum wage doesn't ever -- it doesn't keep up with it.  Why not try to keep prices down for once, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  The houses, the cost of housing or, you know, the cost of ...
L:  The cost of gas.
R:  Right.
L:  'Cause even working minimum wage how are you gonna pay for your gas getting to and from work --
R:  Well, exactly.
L:  -- with the price of gas --
R:  Depending how far it is.
L:  -- uh, with gas prices right now?
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, they're crazy now.
L:  They're almost two bucks.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  You know?
R:  A dollar -- I just said about a dollar seventy five.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know.
L:  And, I mean, most people are -- are getting smart and they're not getting the premium or the supreme or whatever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the highest grade gases now.
R:  Right.
L:  They're getting a lower grade gas.  But those are the same people that have to read their owners manuals to make sure they can take the lower grade.
R:  Yeah, that's true 'cause it might affect the car.
L:  Right.  Most cars now are taking, you know, regular gas.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They -- they -- they tell ya --
