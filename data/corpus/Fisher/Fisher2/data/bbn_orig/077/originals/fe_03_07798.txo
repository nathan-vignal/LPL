R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Desi.
R:  Hi, Desi, my name's Jenny.
L:  I'm calling from Ohio.
R:  And I'm --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- from Virginia.
L:  Okay.
R:  And now I didn't, uh, my son answered the phone so I didn't quite hear the topic.  It's, uh, bad humor and good hum- -- was that it, something about humor?
L:  Yeah.  Where do you c- -- where do you draw the --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- uh, line at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, bad taste in comedy.
R:  Well [NOISE], daughter is sixteen. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  And she -- no, she -- she is a -- she thinks sh- [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] -- she thinks she's a comedian but some of the things she does, because she's a bit heavy set --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so she does -- she'll joke on herself, like, she'll say, "I'm so fat I can whatever, whatever" and I tell her, "I don't think that's ace- --" I mean, for me, not just because I'm her mother but I don't feel that's acceptable because [NOISE] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- even though [NOISE] the other kids are laughing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, with her rather than at her, I still think it's like a put down to herself.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I mean, that's how I feel.  I --
L:  That's a good point.
R:  And I just don't agree with, um, I don't like that kinda humor, the Tom Green kinda humor, I don't ...
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I don't [MN], um, I'm more like Dick van Dyke type of humor. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, how do you feel about it?
L:  Yeah, I do -- I feel that way too but you just don't get, um, the Dick Clark type of humor anymore, hardly.
R:  That's true.
L:  But, uh, yeah, I agree.  I mean, we -- well like, um, when Roseanne, didn't she used -- did she do that at one time?
R:  She did, uh, she used to stand up.  Her and -- like, Rosie O'Donald, she was okay.  Roseanne I like but she was a little bit brass and then I think Ellen de Generes did it too.
L:  And her husband and he -- didn't he joke about the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- drug addiction a- as well?
R:  Right, Tom Arnold, yeah.
L:  And I just, I don't know, I guess you have to make light of some situations --
R:  Well, I know recently --
L:  -- but you can't go too far.
R:  Y- like, um, I don't know if you've watched th- they have a new show now on Channel Ten, I don't know if you've -- th- The Last Comic Standing?
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.
R:  And some of them are really funny.
L:  Yes.
R:  But, um, then they had one comic that was like, making fun of the nine eleven incident, so that, I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- really partial about, I don't like any jokes about that regardless of --
L:  Me either.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  But I don't know.  I mean, do you, um, like any other kind of -- I mean, do you have any favorite comedians like Eddie Murphy or ...?
L:  Yeah.  I'm not gonna lie and say that I don't --
R:  No! [LAUGH]
L:  -- like 'em to get down and dirty sometimes but --
R:  I like him and I like Martin.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I love Martin.  I love him too.
R:  I love Martin.
L:  I don't know, I mean, I like, um, people like, um, Jim Carrey.  I like the, um, [LIPSMACK] -- the improv type comedy, like Drew Carey, that show that he does.  Um --
R:  Oh, you do like Drew Carey?
L:  Yeah, I like him.
R:  Yeah, my daughter likes Drew Carey and she likes Tom Green but I don't -- I don't like Tom Green too much.
L:  I -- I mean, sometimes Drew Carey -- I like -- like, I like his show.  And I like when they do the -- when they act out the little scenes, I like when he does that.  As long as they don't go too far.
R:  What about Saturday Night Live and stuff like that?
L:  I like Saturday Night Live.
R:  Did ya -- I watched it a lot when -- well, we didn't say our ages so, but I mean, I watched it a lot when I was a teenager.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think it came on like, in the seventies.
L:  Okay.
R:  And [LAUGH] -- and I like -- I thought -- to me it was funnier then than it is now, but I sometimes watch it.
L:  Oh, of course it was.
R:  And, um, Comedy Central to me is funny.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I was like, five year- -- I'm thirty -- I'm thirty four, so I was like --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- five years, six years old I guess.  Maybe a little --
R:  Yeah, I'm five years older than you, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  But at least we're in the same genre! [LAUGH]
L:  But I -- I wrote -- I watched it with my -- my older sister, you know, and I just thought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was really funny then, with Steve --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Martin, Gilda Radner --
R:  Oh, I love Steve Martin.
L:  People -- all of them.  Yeah.
R:  And Gilda Radner.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I liked her comedy too.  I liked Roseanne -- Roseanne [inaudible].
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I loved her.
R:  Even though she [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she used to talk about like, the --
L:  And when she played the little girl.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I liked that too.
R:  And she would talk about the, uh, the gritty stuff on your tee- -- but you know, it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just the way she did it.  It was [LAUGH] --
L:  I like her.
R:  It wasn't like, offensive to anybody.
L:  So yeah, I mean, I don't know, some people, you know, I didn't like Don Rickles when I -- when, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I was younger, and I would watch with my mother.  I didn't like him, um, during that Dean Martin and over --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that period.
R:  Right.
L:  And s- -- when I think about going back, he was the one I didn't like. [NOISE]
R:  I'm trying to think back then who I didn't like.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I really can't think of any me- -- uh, I know that I love, um, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of the -- of the older comedy, Lucille Ball and --
L:  Well, now --
R:  -- she's funny.  I -- Lucy, I even watch that now and laugh.
L:  [SIGH] Oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, she -- she was --
R:  She's funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like, Carol Burnett was funny.
L:  Yeah, I like her too.
R:  And so -- but now, I mean, there's -- I guess there's a difference what they want us to talk about.  There's some I guess you could consider raunchy but it is funny.  I think it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- depends on the comedian and how well they can carry it off.
L:  Like Sandra Bernhardt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She can get raunchy.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  'Cause some of 'em though are funny.
L:  Well what --
R:  And they just know how to do it.  But like, you could get Roseanne to tell a joke and maybe Sandra Bernhardt tell the same joke and for one it would work and for another we would be like, "Oh, well that's just nasty".
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] or something.
L:  Well what do you think about like, um, I don't know, uh, what is her name?  Like, Rosie O'Donnell?
R:  Do you li- -- well I like Rosie O'Donnell but that's personally.
L:  Yeah, I like her too.
R:  But, um, I mean as far as her humor now and, um, her show -- and as far as her personal life, I think that her announcing her, um, preferences and stuff, I think that that might have hurt her, which I guess it shouldn't have but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with America, you know.  Um, that's her choice but I know that me and my mom discussed it and she said, "She should've never -- " said, "As soon as she said something, you know, it was all downhill from there".
L:  Mhm.
R:  See, but I like her as far as her comedic talents go.
L:  Yeah.  I think she's funny.  I enjoyed her in the cop movie with the Sheen --
R:  Uh, yeah, I liked that.
L:  I liked that.
R:  Now, do you like the new ones like Chris Rock and ...?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well --
R:  -- um --
L:  -- I don't get to see much of Chris Rock 'cause we don't have cable.
R:  Oh okay.  And -- well, there's another one, um, oh, I don't know, the Waylon brothers I think, he's on a show, it's on Channel Thirteen with Jean [inaudible] Martin but I can't think of the name of that show --
L:  [SIGH] Oh.
R:  -- but I think he's funny.
L:  One of the Wayan brothers.
R:  Do you know who I'm talking [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I can't think of the -- something about married.  I don't know.  I know it's on on ABC, I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- watch it too much but he's real funny, I like him.
L:  Yeah, he's funny.  He's -- he's -- he m- -- he reminds me of like a, um, Bill Cosby kind of thing now.
R:  Yeah [MN] --
L:  And it's really positive, you know.
R:  Now, I like Bill Cosby but my, uh, my dad never liked him, he said he was -- thought he was too, um, static and tried to make people laugh.  Well, I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- didn't see it like that but [SIGH] my dad didn't like his humor too much.
L:  He have -- h- he would have to really do something special like, his cartoons are funny.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Fat Albert.
R:  The Fat Albert.
L:  And stuff like that.  You know.  It -- you have to be -- it's really picky for me with him.
R:  [NOISE] But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there is nothing -- I mean, where do you think that they should -- should stop and draw the line at?  As far as being acceptable and non acceptable.
L:  I think that it's a form of creativity and no matter what it's America.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they should just go ahead and do their thing because some- -- believe me you, somebody's gonna follow 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  I think that.  You're exactly right though --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that.
L:  Somebody's gonna follow it, you know.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But my personal choice is, you know, like Will and Grace, topics like that -- I like Will and Grace though.
R:  I love Will and Grace.
L:  It's tasteful, you know.  And it, um, my five year old watches it --
R:  I like Will and Grace.
L:  -- and she thinks it's funny, you know.
R:  My -- yeah, my sixteen year old watches it.  My twenty year old son, he's no longer [MN] in the house but he calls me every -- well, not now 'cause we're on reruns -- but every Thursday --
L:  Mhm.
R:  "Shaun Hayes is the funniest thing in the world.  Deborah Messing is the funniest thing in the world".  So yeah, we love that show.
L:  And then did you see when he did the Jerry Lewis, um --
R:  Perfect.
L:  Oh wasn't he good?
R:  [LAUGH] He was --
L:  He was so good.
R:  -- very good.
L:  Yeah, I enjoyed that.
R:  Did ya?  You know, everybody that I talked to at work, they said that they did not like it, they didn't think it was --
L:  What?
R:  Th- they said, "Oh what?  He's not Jerry Le- --"  I said, "Oh you [several inaudible words] is dumb and he was just wonderful".
L:  I mean, well, it just -- he -- he was able to pull that part off.
R:  But see, even when I watch Will and Grace though, well, before even Jerry Lewis even came along I would say, you know, "He reminds me of Jerry" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  This is way before the movie.  So I --
L:  That kinda slapstick sorta comedy --
R:  So I --
L:  -- in a new way.
R:  Yeah, I already thought, y- -- I have someone -- when they announced he was playing him I -- 'cause I said I could definitely see it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It wasn't like a whole stretch for me.  But yeah, that -- that was funny.
L:  Yep, I enjoyed that.
R:  And, uh, [SIGH] --
L:  Now, um, I don't know them -- I don't know their real names, uh, Will -- the guy that plays Will, he has a movie coming out too and it looks like it may be good.  I saw that.
R:  Now I haven't seen the previews for that, is that gonna be a comedy that -- do you know?
L:  It's kind of a comedy and some kinda -- where he's playing a, um, [NOISE] a author or something and there's a lady that's -- that's writing the book for him.  I mean, don't quote me on that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it looked like it -- I don't know, it didn't look as good as the Jerry Lewis movie.  So ...
R:  Uh, we might wa- -- yeah, I don't know.
L:  His movie did a little better.
R:  I -- I like comedy anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Drama better but the subject is comedy [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, do you go to any comedy clubs or anything in your ar- -- I know here they're all over the place because I'm about thirty miles from Virginia Beach, so there's a whole lot of comedy --
L:  Boy, you're lucky.
R:  -- in my area.  Well, I'm right in tourist land.
L:  No, we don't have any com- -- we did have a comedy club but not any more.
R:  No?
L:  We just, uh, like, if -- I think people like, do stand up at open mic and stuff like that but, um, there's no specific club here in Ohio.
R:  Well now, there's one club here where you already know this -- so I was telling my daughter 'cause she can't wait to turn eighteen and go -- but they -- the comics purposely make fun of you, like, if you're in the first three rows.
L:  Mm.
R:  And she thinks that's the funniest thing.
L:  I don't.
R:  I mean, she just -- her humor is so -- but that's fine for her.
L:  No.
R:  But she said, "Oh, I would love to do that, I'd love to be up there and, you know, tell somebody that they look ugly or --" [LAUGH] --
L:  No! [LAUGH]
R:  And I tell her no.
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  But --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she [LAUGH] -- this is how this club works.  I mean, it's very popular but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't go to it, 'cause I like -- I don't wanna be made fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'd probably start crying.
L:  There are comedians that will point you out in the audience.
R:  [COUGH] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  If I know me, I'd be crying, [LAUGH] "Please don't!"
L:  What do you think about Bernie Mac?
R:  Oh, I like him.  So I hope you're not gonna tell me you don't!
