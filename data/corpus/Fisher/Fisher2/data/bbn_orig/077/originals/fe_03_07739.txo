R:  Katrina.
L:  Hi, my name is Penny [LAUGH] and to me raising the minimum wage to five fifteen [NOISE] I wouldn't know how that would -- a family would survive on that amount of money anyway.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I would think the time they bought groceries and the house payment or rent or -- for a young mother with kids to try to work I wouldn't see how she could make any money.
R:  Right.  I agree with you.  I mean, I'm -- I'm a single parent and I have two young children.  So, I know that if I was starting out in the workforce and trying to go to work for five dollars and fifteen it -- you know, it -- it probably would barely cover whatever bills I had, you know?  I can't see that it -- it would meet everything, but I'm sure, you know -- I'm sure the increase has helped, but I don't think it's enough.
L:  No.
R:  I think, you know, with the economy being as sluggish as it is right now and so many people being out of work, you know, the people who are working are not gonna complain about it because they -- they're lucky to have their jobs.  That's -- you know, that's probably the mindset that I'm lucky to have this because I could have nothing.
L:  Right.
R:  But really -- it's -- it's really not enough for what -- you know, what we need just to -- to basically survive, just your basic, you know, groceries and bills and, you know, you -- you can't even factor in health care and that, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I don't even know how people would survive on that and then try to take care of children if they had any or just themselves.  If you get sick and you have to miss a day of work most minimum wage paying jobs they don't even have good coverage.
L:  Right.
R:  Or if they do have coverage you have to pay a huge deductible.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's just one of those situations where I -- I really cannot comprehend how you using a payroll -- somebody's working for five fifteen you expect them to be held accountable to the same standard as somebody who's making ten or twelve dollars an hour.
L:  Right.
R:  But yet, you know, you don't give 'em a break at all.
L:  Nope.
R:  You know, especially where health coverage is concerned.  They pay more for health coverage than a company who get employees that make, you know, twelve, thirteen, twenty bucks an hour and it ...
L:  Yeah, 'cause your union companies or your bigger companies are going to have --
R:  Right.
L:  -- some health benefits.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And as I said, I ...
R:  But a company ...  Uh-huh.  Go ahead.
L:  No, go ahead.
R:  The company that I was working for, uh, we recently just got bought out by Tyson and -- but, uh, I remember when we -- I -- it's a plant that I work for and the way the plant worked when you first, uh, sign on they give you a tour so you can understand the business from the ground up and so it's a ham processing plant and one of the things that they do is take you down to the -- to the -- the basement where you can see where the ham is made and that kinda thing.  And most of the people there, I mean, have been there for like twenty years, they've been in the same position, they're real good [inaudible] always and most of 'em -- a great majority of 'em are like Hispanic women because they carry the weight of their families on their back and these women work in -- you know, the conditions are horrible.  It's freezing.  It's cold.  You know, they have to constantly deal with meat and stand in the same one little position all day for eight hours every day and they get paid minimum wage, you know, and -- and I would think oh, you know, oh, my gosh, I couldn't ...  You know, where we were upstairs if I had to sit at my desk for a straight eight hours I would go crazy.  So, I can't even imagine trying to sit at a desk and be confined in that area.  And these women had to be confined to just a certain little box, you know?
L:  Wow!
R:  That's -- it -- it makes you think about what people have to do for five fifteen an hour.
L:  So, realistically as you say they were taken advantage of?
R:  Yeah, I really do think so.  I mean, there's -- there's no way that I could say in good conscious that okay, that's a great job that, you know, what you're -- and -- and they perform a huge service because I remember once several of the people had gotten sick and we just -- production was just -- there was a [inaudible] on in production because these people produce everything.  So, you know, it's up to us to have to call the customer and you gotta go your meat's gonna be delayed because we -- we supply meat to a lotta the major grocery stores across the country and with these people not working it's like okay, well, the meat's not gonna be produced, it's not gonna be -- it's not gonna be produced, it's not gonna be packaged, it's not gonna shipped, all that stuff that they do and they get paid way less than we do.  I mean, the ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, they carry the company on their back --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they don't get well paid for it at all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think that's probably the case in most jobs where the people, you know, work for minimum wage they do a great percentage of the work with no credit, no recognition and, you know -- and no break whatsoever.  So, I don't know.
L:  I just don't know how they, you know, function though.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as I say and, I mean, even I'm sure there's a lot -- even if the husband and wife are both working at that amount of money --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- it's still -- they both still gotta lotta work expenses and -- you know, and for young couples or young single people even just starting out --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  I just do not understand how our government thinks that they can ...  And, I mean, most of those businesses are making big bucks.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I mean ...
L:  You know, it's --
R:  -- it's like here ...
L:  -- it's just more fat in their pockets.
R:  Right.  And see I live here in Houston.  So, I -- I -- well, the Enron scandal here, I mean, it was just, you know, horrible and it was just -- you know, and then they kept spurning out more and more stuff about Ken Delay[?] and his family and his wife and, you know, it was like look at -- they got these hundred thousand dollar bonuses and these huge raises and, you know -- and just scamming all these people and -- and just taking advantage of them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they never missed a beat, you know?  They could hire these fancy high price lawyers to help them get out of these situations and, you know, the other half of the company is all filing for unemployment.  It didn't seem to bother them whatsoever, you know?
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, he seemed to be a little bit disturbed when they had to, uh, auction off some of the things at his house.  That was the -- you know, that was when he kind- kinda got a little perturbed.  But, you know?
L:  That was sad, wasn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm so sorry we have to auction off the things at your hundred thousand dollar home, you know, to pay for some of the things that you've taken from all these people.  But I don't know.  I just, uh -- I mean, I understood our system and I understand it's a -- you know, our economy's -- and we're -- you know, we're a capitalist society.  I understand all that.  But I just think that sometimes we need to remember that, you know, we're all human and we all need the same basic things to survive and we should be able as a country to make sure that we can provide for everybody on the same economic level and that's --
L:  And that's definitely right.
R:  -- where I don't think that we do.  You know, we -- we don't do that and -- and then we don't encourage people, especially I think minorities, they don't encourage minorities to be more, to do more, and I think that's kinda sad because when I look at those women, you know, I think gosh, you know, I -- most of them -- you could tell some of them are like maybe eighteen, nineteen, twenty, they are just getting outta high school and coming to work at the mill, you know, that's what the family does, that's what they're gonna do and, you know, their Mom started there when they were like eighteen, twenty, somewhere around -- and they've been there for twenty years and there's just got no hope, you know, there's -- there's no -- no progress.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, you -- you just wanna see people do more.  You wanna see people expand.  You wanna say, "Hey, you know what?  You could go to school and be, you know, X. Y. Z, whatever it is that you wanna be if that's what you wanna be".
L:  Oh, these days you definitely can.  As you say, these young people getting outta high school need to realize that too.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, there's so many wonderful opportunities out there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- right now and especially for women I think.
R:  Yeah.  I think so too.  I really think so.  I mean, like I told you, I -- I'm a single parent and when our company got bought out by Tyson the options were we could move to Arkansas, which is where the headquarters for Tyson are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or we could just, you know, loss our job and take the company buy off.  So, I did that and I decided that I'm going back to school.  So, I've been doing my paperwork and getting everything ready and, you know, this fall I'm gonna go back to school full time because I don't wanna be in that situation again where, you know, I'm out of a job because upper management feels like oh, we are gonna move the headquarters or, you know, no longer need you, or whatever.  I wanna be in a position where I'm always needed.  So, I decided I'm gonna go back to school and, uh, become a teacher and I know it's probably not the most lucrative business, but you're gonna always need teachers.
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  And I'm just -- I'm -- I'm really comfortable around kids.  I love teaching kids.  I've been teaching sign language to children for years but, you know, at no cost.  So, I decided I'm gonna go and get my elementary education degree and specialize in sign language because that way I can provide for myself and assure a better future for myself and my kid --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because I just -- you know, I don't see myself -- I -- and not that -- I don't think that -- well, I think everyone should in their mind think that I can make more than minimum wage.  I think we should all have that mindset, you know, to make us wanna do more.  But I know for myself I just really cannot see just trying to maintain the monthly bills on minimum wage without, you know, ever thinking hey, maybe I should -- maybe I can do more, maybe I can achieve more.  I don't wanna get in that mindset.
L:  And so many of 'em know that they're making the minimum wage and they're just barely -- barely getting by.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Then they're scared to try for everything else though --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because then if that job doesn't work out or they lose that job, you know?  Then they're really in trouble.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know?  And they can't save any money or get ahead to even --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- have a cushion to be able to do anything different.
R:  Right.  And I think it's that fear factor that holds a lotta people back too, thinking okay, well, you know, it was good enough for so and so it's gonna be good enough for me and, you know, I should just take it and move on.  But you -- you can't let yourself get caught up in that.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  But I know it's, you know -- the thing is you have to be able -- you have to find an outlet and you have to know where to go as far as resource wise to be able to get you some financial aid or whatever to go to school just to know that you can do better.  But a lotta people are just, you know, like you said, they're afraid, don't have any cushion, so they're afraid to make waves where they are because what happens if things don't work out, then you'll be out there looking for another job and, you know -- and so people just grab at whatever the first job they can find, they hold on to it and they stay dedicated to it and -- and never move ahead and I think that's sad for our society to just allow that and accept it.
