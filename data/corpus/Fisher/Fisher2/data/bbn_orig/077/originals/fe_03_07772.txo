L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Erica.
R:  Hi, Erica, my name is Nancy, I'm from California.
L:  Yee -- oh, I'm not from California but I am in California.
R:  Oh, all right.
L:  I'm actually in San Francisco.
R:  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Awesome.  Nice to talk to you. [NOISE]  I guess, um, I've not done one of these before, have you? 
R:  I've done several [NOISE], yeah.
L:  Okay, great.  All right.
R:  So the -- the minimum wage is five dollars and fifteen cents.
L:  I thought it was six seventy five.
R:  Is that what she said?
L:  She said five fifteen.  But, on minimum wage I think it should be more than that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  How hi do you think it should go?
L:  I don't know.  I think maybe like, you know, eight dollars?  And there's a lotta people on this city who live like, three or four people to a house, you know, or to a room, because they can't afford, you know, anything.  I mean, [several inaudible words] is, I guess San Francisco's extremely expensive to live in, but, you know, people -- I guess, you know, in other parts of the country, like, I'm from the mid West originally and a person could [NOISE] live and maybe even someday buy a house like, working at Home Depot, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or the grocery store.  In a city like this [NOISE] that's -- you can't even pay your rent with a job like that. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And the same would be true down here.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Um, where in the mid west are you from?
L:  [NOISE] Minneapolis. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I'm from Iowa, that's why I ask.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I'm from Minneapolis and my folks are from Chicago. [NOISE]  And so I'm kinda from both but I was raised in Minneapolis, or outside Minneapolis. [NOISE]
R:  Did you ever have to -- you yourself, did you ever have to work for minimum wage?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, actually my first job was minimum wage and I think it was four and a quarter. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When I started working.  And I worked -- I think I had a part time job at a drug store and I was still h- like, in high school.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  So [NOISE] --
R:  I was in Los Angeles and I think it was probably in the seventies and the minimum wage at that time was three fifty.
L:  [NOISE] Oh wow. [NOISE] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow. [NOISE]
R:  Y- --
L:  And that -- that -- was that enough for you to survive off of?
R:  Um, well, I did, uh, I -- I was raising a whole bunch of kids --
L:  [SIGH] Mm.
R:  -- by myself, but it -- it was tough.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It was really tough.  But then, prices were --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- much lower again.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, I'm --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- not talking about, um, rent or anything like that, what I'm talking about food prices.
L:  Oh.  I see.  Wow.  I mean, the places up here are expensive, you know, [several inaudible words] regular old block of cheese or yogurt it's like, a dollar -- like, a dollar for a thing of yoghurt where like, back home would be three for a dollar. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.
L:  And like ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And like, cheese is like f- three or four dollars a pound.
R:  Right.  It is --
L:  And --
R:  -- down here too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I -- I -- yeah, on the west coast I think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- things are much higher than they are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in the mid west or in -- but I don't know.
L:  Or even the south east.  I know in the south east some of my friends have gotten houses to rent there for four hundred, four hundred and fifty dollars [NOISE] a month, for like a three or four bedroom, two bathroom house.
R:  And that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would be unheard of out here.
L:  Yeah.  That would be -- yeah.  Huh.  Unless you'd been paying off a mortgage for, you know, twenty or thirty years.
R:  Yeah.  Do you feel that if someone is here without documentation and say, working in a restaurant --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that they should be paid minimum wage?
L:  Hm.  Versus what?
R:  Versus being paid under the counter.
L:  I guess I think that they should be paid minimum wage then because of, um, so then the government would get taxes off that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Right?
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [NOISE] but then the -- that person wouldn't be making anywhere near as much money [NOISE] and they wouldn't be able to [NOISE] -- they wouldn't be able to afford to live there -- live here either, you know?
R:  Yeah, they wouldn't have to pay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- taxes and they wouldn't have to have withholding also.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  I mean, I think that [NOISE], you know, I think fair's fair, you know?  You should -- they should pay taxes.  I mean, I don't like paying taxes at all, [NOISE] but [NOISE] --
R:  Uh, [MN] --
L:  -- I think that they should.  I mean, I've been paid under the table before [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for like, for very small amounts of money but [NOISE], you know.
R:  Uh, I -- I'm gonna digress for just a minute, um --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- i- if you don't mind.  The, uh, California governor is talking about massive cuts in services and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- also raising taxes, sales tax.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- car registration fees and so on.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you think that that is a good idea?
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] No.  [NOISE]  I mean, I don't know, see, the problem with California that I [inaudible] 'cause I've only been out here for three years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What I've learned is like, California really screwed themselves like with [NOISE] -- with the power issue a couple of years ago, where they'd like [NOISE] really [inaudible] really, really screw the California government.  Or like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the government, like the [NOISE] [SIGH] -- let's see, what did they do?  The made the state like, power used to be public and then it became a private enterprise [NOISE] and then the power company like, goes bankrupt.  You know?  And the people there make a ton of money, right?  Now the California citizens are paying again for the power, you know, that they had already paid for 'cause California's in debt.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And preferably, I mean, I don't -- I mean, in a perfect world, you know, California and the government could take care of the debt and take care of like, all that without having to [NOISE] impose any more of a tax on us.  I mean, I pay a -- I mean, I'm a single -- I'm a single woman, I don't have any children or anything, but I might -- I mean, I eat well [NOISE] and I'm also a vegetarian, so I don't spend money on meat or anything, and my [NOISE] weekly food budget is [NOISE] -- not counting takeout or anything -- is like thirty or forty dollars a week, maybe even more, maybe fifty. [NOISE]  And that's a lot for a single person to be paying --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for food.
R:  Yeah, for one person.
L:  And especially -- and I cook.  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  And then our raised sales tax on this and that, you know.  [NOISE]  And there was a store and even like, [NOISE] the cheese tubes [inaudible] like, three dollars a tube or something.
R:  Yeah, true.
L:  And then tax on that and all, you know. [NOISE]
R:  Do you ever use --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coupons to cut down the -- the cost of the market bills?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  When I can. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  When I can.  I don't buy a lot of prepackaged food.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I buy mostly fresh fruits, vegetables or grains in bulk. [NOISE]  Cheese and eggs. [NOISE] 
R:  Oh, okay.  So there are very rarely coupons on -- on those things.
L:  Yes, exactly.  I don't buy a lot of like, um, manufactured items or, you know, like, food in a box.  A lot of times I can't afford it.  And, I mean, I make over minimum wage.  What I make is fifteen dollars an hour.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I work probably thirty five, forty hours a week.  [NOISE]  Probably closer to thirty five. [NOISE]
R:  So, you're making a- about three times the minimum wage?
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And I'm s- -- and I'm barely covering my bills [inaudible] per month. [NOISE]  I mean, heaven forbid I should ever become ill [NOISE], I would be in serious trouble. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Uh, no insurance?
L:  [NOISE] No, no insurance.
R:  Uh.  W- what do you do?
L:  Um, I'm a pharmacy -- I'm a pharmacy tech and lab technician for a non profit animal hospital.
R:  Uh, okay.
L:  In San Francisco.  It's called, um, Pets Limited. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...  I was unemployed for two months this year as well, so it's a pretty new job to me. [NOISE]
R:  Do you like it?
L:  I love it.  I love it.
R:  Oh good.
L:  Yeah, I love it.
R:  Great.
L:  It's great.  I love animals.
R:  You gonna stay in that field then?
L:  Mm, I don't know.  I'll probably stay in the hospital but I may change departments eventually. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it -- it seem- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- increasing more and more difficult to make ends meet.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.  [NOISE]  I think it's just like, our cost of living just keeps rising and rising and rising and rising.  And you get minimum wage is still the same.  Actually, minimum wage right now is really six seventy five.  At least it is in California. [LAUGH]  Um, but even then, I mean, I was ecstatic 'cause I used to wait tables out here, and my, um, minimum wage went from five fifteen [NOISE] to like, five seventy five to like, six seventy five or something like that.  [NOISE]  It slowly has creeped up over the last like, each year, you know, a little bit more, a little bit more. [NOISE]  But making six seventy five or f- -- even or five fifteen like the study is talking about, like an hour, you're making like [NOISE], [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I don't know the calculation off the top of my head but you're making
