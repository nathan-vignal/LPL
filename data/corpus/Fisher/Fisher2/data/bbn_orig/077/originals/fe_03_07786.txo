L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm --
R:  My name's -- I'm sorry --
L:  Go -- go ahead. [LAUGH]
R:  My name is Tamara.
L:  And my name's Pat.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Michigan.
R:  Oh nice, I'm from -- well, I'm Boston right now.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, I'm hoping to move to Chicago, so a little closer out your way.
L:  Oh [LAUGH] -kay.  And we're supposed to discuss --
R:  Humor.
L:  Humor, huh.  Okay.  Oh, humor, I don't know.  Uh, [SIGH] I find nothing humorous on TV anymore, you know, but ...
R:  That's fair enough.  There -- well, John Stewart, I like him, political humor.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Stuff like that.  If it's a little smart and clever.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Uh, some of it's kinda sick though, you know, and uncall- --
R:  Yeah, I think that's what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uncalled for and, yeah, you know, in bad taste.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ... yeah --
R:  And it's just a little too easy.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  They go for the, like, simple humor.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think some of the, um, black humor is funny but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] carry it too far sometimes, but --
R:  I still think Eddie Murphy is, um, [LIPSMACK] like, cable TV comedy stuff --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- is the funniest ever in the whole world --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but that might have been pushing the line.  He was still funny though.  And it was clever, it was smart humor.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [several inaudible words].  But there's some good stuff still out there.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  Well, I'm not much -- I'm not much of a TV watcher anymore, I used to be but not anymore and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know, once in a while I'll turn into something funny but then I like, mm, you know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, the late night TV shows aren't as funny as they used to be.
L:  No.
R:  Although I like Saturday Night Live, still.
L:  Oh do ya?
R:  Do you know the -- the head writer, Tina Fay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think she's really funny and she does a good job.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, so I think we're supposed to be talking about one that crosses the line.
L:  Oh, cr- --
R:  [inaudible] on television --
L:  Yeah.
R:  and [several inaudible words] inappropriate and I don't know.
L:  I don't know any --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- any -- I think a lot of TV is inappropriate anymore, it's not just, you know, humor but --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I don't find the four letter word, uh, used on TV very, um, humorous, you know.
R:  No.
L:  But ...
R:  And the talk shows aren't very good and --
L:  No, no, no.
R:  -- there's -- they get violent and stuff.  I don't know, I feel like people have to work harder to make you laugh, they can't just like, beat each other up or put on some dumb sitcom or something, that people are getting wiser and they want -- they want better quality television.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like, um, [LIPSMACK] some of the shows they have on HBO now, I think they're better, but we don't get it, so I have to go over to a --
L:  No, I don't either.
R:  -- friends apartment to watch it.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't.  And, you know, some of these, um, survival shows, you know, I --
R:  Oh, I can't watch them.
L:  I find a little humor in them but when it comes to eating the bugs and stuff I think, "Oh, I can't deal with this".  [SIGH] The --
R:  Oh, the Fear Factor stuff?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't understand why anybody would go on those shows.
L:  No, I don't either, I don't either.
R:  'Cause the most -- this -- it doesn't make any sense.  The most money you can win is something like thirty thousand dollars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But you're not guaranteed, you have to do all that disgusting stuff and you might go home with nothing.
L:  Really?
R:  So I don't even know why you'd wanna compete, you know.
L:  And I'm -- I'm not gonna eat something that [LAUGH] [inaudible], just for the money.  And I think, yeah, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of a sick, sick show.
R:  I think people just wanna get on television.
L:  Yeah, I do too, I do too.
R:  Pretty much.
L:  But you know, TV has changed a lot.  You sound like a young person.
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- twenty four.
L:  Yeah, well I'm older.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, over the years, you know, with, um, comedy and humor --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it has changed a lot, you know, compared to --
R:  I think it goes back and forth.  I think it's getting a little better, sometimes, in some ways.  Like, the comedy shows might be getting better [NOISE].  And the newspapers and things like that, sometimes they get pretty good. [NOISE]  There's, um, there's an author I like, David Barry.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He writes for The New York Times.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  And he's hysterical.  He's really funny.
L:  Oh.
R:  [inaudible] a lot of political humor.  I just don't think you can go wrong with -- with that kind of thing, 'cause everybody likes be- having the politicians and stuff --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [inaudible] fun of.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You can't really insult anybody with that except for, well, the politician! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Oh.
R:  I don't know.
L:  I -- I've never read him.  I never read him.
R:  No?  He's --
L:  I'll have to -- I'll have to, you know -- is that --
R:  Do you ever like ... what's that?
L:  I didn't know if they cut us off or what, but --
R:  Oh no, I hear ya.
L:  Oh.  I -- I've never read him.  Now, he's just in The New York ...?
R:  In The New York Times.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, he also wrote a couple of books, he's real funny.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  Do you have any comedians you like?
L:  Well, like I said, I'm older and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my favorite used to be George Carlin.
R:  I love him.
L:  Oh, I used to crack up at [LAUGH] --
R:  He -- I used to listen when I was, um, when I was a kid, I probably shouldn't have been listening to this but we used to listen to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the, um, [LIPSMACK] the, what was it?  Like, seven words you can't say --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- on television or something?  Man, is he funny!  He used to be brilliant and then he had that horrible TV show.
L:  Oh I know, I know.
R:  It was bad.  Yeah, George Carlin was one of my favorites.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  And it was -- it was r- kinda raunchy but my family, we would all watch it together --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause he was so funny.
L:  And let's see, um, I don't know.
R:  He --
L:  Uh, I can't think of the guy with the -- the heavyset guy with the guy with the glasses with a book, uh, he's on, uh, um, sitcom, oh, Drew Carey.  Drew Car- --
R:  Drew Carey?  I never got into that show.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I don't watch his show but once in a while I'll see him on a talk show or a -- and he -- he's real funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, he's real funny but -- and I --
R:  George Carlin used to be great though.
L:  -- I like Robin Williams, oh, he's funny too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  He is funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wish they still had more of those comedy shows on like, um, cable television that they use- --
L:  I do too, I do too.
R:  And then again I'd have to get cable [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to start watching them.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  All the good stuff's on cable.
R:  And they used to do that comedy sh- -- I don't know if they still do, for homeless people.  Once a year they would do, um, [LIPSMACK] do you remember this?  It was Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They used to host that show once a year.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah.
R:  Like, Comedy Aid or something?  That was a really good show.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, we used to watch Carol Burnett when I was growing up.
L:  Oh gosh. [LAUGH]
R:  She was funny.
L:  Yeah, she was funny back then.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't find her fun- -- and just like Lucy, oh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, well, see, I grew up with Lucy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now I -- I don't find 'em funny at all.  Now, isn't that terrible?  I don't know, maybe I've gotten old.  Too old.
R:  No.  I think -- I think humor has changed a little bit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was more maybe like, slapstick funny.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  We used to watch Benny Hill too on Nick at night.
L:  Oh did ya?
R:  Mhm.
L:  No, I --
R:  [LIPSMACK] [inaudible] was fun.
L:  I know --
R:  And it was all in good humor.
L:  Yeah.  I never watched him.  I don't know why, I never watched him.  But yeah, you're right, humor has changed, you know.
R:  And some of it's gotten better and some of its gotten --
L:  Yeah, worse.
R:  -- worse I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible].  But there's some really smart stuff out there.
L:  [SIGH] Well, what kinda channels do you get?
R:  Just the regular like, um, lo- -- like, basic cable.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  We get --
L:  Me too, me too, bas- --
R:  -- like, we get some -- I guess there are some cable shows 'cause we get Comedy Central and we get like, a learning channel and stuff like that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Discovery.  I don't know, my roommate set it up, I don't know what was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she said it's basic cable.
L:  Oh, you have a roommate, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Two roommates, yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't get much comedy on basic ch- uh, cable here.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  Mostly movies or, um, mm, talk shows and ... so --
R:  Some of the movies that have come out, like some of the comedies now are just not funny anymore.  They -- they got old real fast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, they found out some sort of like, you know, basic idea that they're gonna follow every single comedy, I saw, um, Bruce Almighty --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- did you see that movie?
L:  No I haven't.
R:  It was with Jim Carrey and it thought it was -- and Jennifer Aniston -- I thought it was supposed to be funny but it was just awful.
L:  Was it?
R:  Yeah.  Huh.
L:  You know, somebody else I don't -- I don't like that Jim Carrey.  I don't like him at all.
R:  Really?
L:  I don't find him funny.
R:  Yeah, I guess I didn't -- I never really did.  I didn't like Ace Ventura, I didn't like The Mask --
L:  No.
R:  -- and of that stuff, Liar Liar.
L:  I -- he overdoe-
