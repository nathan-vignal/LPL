R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Susan.
R:  I'm Debbie.
L:  Hi, Debbie, how are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Okay, where do we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- draw the line between comedy?
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Is that it? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  Myself, I have a pretty good sense of humor, a sick sense of humor, so, uh --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- I -- I don't really know how to respond [NOISE] to this one.
R:  No, I guess I -- I don't -- I mean, I [NOISE] -- I have a pretty good sense of humor I guess, I -- I'm not into a l- -- you know, a lot of really vulgar stuff but --
L:  Oh no, I'm not, but like, I like South Park --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think there's a line to be drawn like, uh, on a certain --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- age limit on that because of some of the things --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- on that.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But other than that, I mean -- and there is some --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, stand up comedy I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kids don't need to see.
R:  Right, right.
L:  But I don't --
R:  Well and I mean, like, South Park is on MTV and you just generally know that little kids is not -- are not [NOISE], you know.
L:  Yeah.  Well, and at the time of the night that they have that on, they shouldn't even be up out of bed anyway.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know?  And I've got a TV in my bedroom to where they wouldn't see it anyway.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  So -- but other than that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't --
R:  Yeah.  I'm not --
L:  -- know, you know, I think a lotta times they go to extremes like on, um, when they're poking at, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the comments made on the president's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stuff.  Y- you know what I'm saying?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I think sometimes they overdo -- overdo it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes they go a little bit far.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, on the Saturday Night Live skits and stuff sometimes they --
L:  Oh yeah.  See, that's another one I like to watch too.  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, I -- I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, I'm not real, you know [NOISE] -- some people find things, well, you know, funny, that I don't, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then --
L:  Well, Saturday Night Live sometime- I honestly sometimes don't -- I wonder how they get by --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- saying some of the things they say.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, and I do too, I [NOISE] --
L:  You know?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause I'm thinking, you know, it will be like you or I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we'd be up on a slander suit or something.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  But I don't know how --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they get by with it but as far back as the basic question where the line should be drawn, I don't know how to answer that because ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I don't know, you know.  Huh.
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda whatever, you know, people will bear I suppose.
L:  Yeah.  And then there's always such a thing, you know, you don't like it, you can always --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- change the channel too.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know.  And I'm a firm believer in that.
R:  Mhm.  Yea.
L:  So ...
R:  And sometimes I do and if it, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if enough people switch the channel well --
L:  Yeah.  I mean, that's -- that's their option.  G- d- that's what that button's there for.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But --
R:  [MN] Um --
L:  So where are you from?
R:  I'm from Nebraska.
L:  Nebraska?  I live in West Virginia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We've been getting a lot of rain here.
R:  Yeah, we haven't -- it's been really windy here lately.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah, so -- today it's been twenty and thirty mile an hour winds so it's --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- not real fun to be out. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  But it's been really -- we've had a l- um, rains --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to where we're having mud slides and --
R:  Oh.  Ooh.
L:  -- oh, it's been bad, so we could use some of that wind.
R:  Yeah, dry everything out.
L:  To -- y- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, yeah, we haven't -- we haven't had just tons of rain lately --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so we could actually kinda use it.
L:  Yeah.  You know, and as far as on this comedy thing too --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- [NOISE] uh, we limit [COUGH] like, what the kids watch on TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, they've got children's -- their own comedy things going on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know.  So it's not like they watch the ones that we would watch, the adult I guess you would say.
R:  Right, yeah.  My kids have, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they have the Disney channel and they've got --
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's the same here.  And you know, Disney channel, they've got their own comedy stuff on it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, that ... they watch though.  I don't know, I -- I hate to see 'em do away with it on TV.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Because [NOISE] everything out there is so negative I think anyway, right now. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  You know, the --
R:  It's good to have the -- kinda the break.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] So --
L:  And I don't know what else they want us to do here, do you?
R:  Not real- --
L:  I know w- we've gotta stay on here ten minutes.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Um, I was just trying to think of, you know, if there's anything else, um [NOISE] ... Uh, [NOISE] what's the comedy on the kids?
L:  I just, uh -- what -- wh- --
R:  I mean, they have a totally different sense of humor so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, you know, and they -- they don't get the -- fortunately don't get the [SIGH] [NOISE] -- kinda the vulgar stuff, so --
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  W- now, what --
R:  So --
L:  -- was it they're wanting us --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to know where we think ... ?
R:  What?
L:  The original --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- question was the fine line between the comedy ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Was that it, right?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, wha- -- yeah, what's --
L:  [MN]
R:  Where's your line? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, like I think what it is is when they go overboard --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the -- well, you know, with the govern --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, with certain people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- even the Michael Jackson stuff, they're taking that stuff like, to extremes.
R:  Right, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Sometimes it's -- you just kinda start thinking, "Just leave him alone".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  Exactly.  Other than that -- and then the -- the president's mess.  I mean [NOISE] -- I know that's our president but they've got -- they went overboard on it quite a bit too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  There for a lotta year- -- uh, I'm talking on Clinton.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Monica.  And hell, that's done, uh, that's happened, it's over.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  Leave it alone, let it [LAUGH] -- you know, that -- that's my feelings toward it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just let it go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on [inaudible] but there's always gonna be somebody, you know.
R:  Right, yeah.  Somebody's gonna keep bringing it up and [NOISE] stuff.
L:  Well I --
R:  Um --
L:  I just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  It sounds like you got a little one there.
R:  Yeah, I've got two actually.  Three and one.
L:  Oh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you got your hands full.
R:  Yeah, my three year old's making a mess right now.
L:  I have a three year old granddaughter that lives here with me.
R:  Oh.
L:  So I -- I know what you --
R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  And she's a holy terror.
R:  Yeah!
L:  And, huh, it's kinda hard to do these, just --
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  It -- just by luck tonight they're having a concert at the city park and her mom took 'em to it.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  It's a cultural thing where they've got all different heritages and, uh, thought it would be nice to take them to see the -- they do the different dances --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  And that's the only reason I've got peace and quiet right now, otherwise this house would be in an uproar. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  It would not be this quiet.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, it's not normally -- actually, it's quieting down, so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Because, uh, well, my son's -- he's playing with some water and daughter's digging up --
L:  And your one year old, is he or she walking and stuff?
R:  Um, yeah, mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Well, she's actually, um, almost eighteen months --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- she's seventeen months.
L:  Oh my gosh, and three?
R:  So -- three.  Yeah, he turned three in April.
L:  You poor woman.
R:  So -- yeah, I don't know that I'd have 'em that close together again.
L:  Argh!
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE] Well, I guess you'd have to have a sense of humor here. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes! [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, the three year old --
L:  'Cause you've got your hands full.
R:  -- in particular is starting to say some pretty funny things, so ...
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So that's -- oh --
L:  I know that one I've got, you never know what's gonna come out of her mouth anymore.
R:  Yeah.  Well, and the things he notices, you just never know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, what ... what he's gonna notice and come up with next.
L:  That's the same thing here.  She watches, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Nickelodeon and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Tune --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Disney.  And some of the stuff she comes --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- off with on that stuff --
R:  Yeah, some --
L:  -- you know.  And it's like --
R:  I kinda wonder if sometimes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, like, he -- I thought he'd really enjoy the whole Monsters movie --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it wasn't until the very end --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the -- Mike's new car, that just was rolling on the floor laughing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, it -- it's weird.  I know, she's the same way.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  But she's in --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But she's into the Dora Explorer stuff and Bob the Builder and i- it's a little girl.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, my daughter is actually, she's really into Bob the Builder.
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The -- Harley loves it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, that's -- that's the idol.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, she -- I mean, I -- that's the only video that she'll watch, is the Bob the Builder. [NOISE]
L:  Now that's weird.
R:  [NOISE] So [NOISE] ...

R:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
L:  And then she watches the
