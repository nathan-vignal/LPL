R:  Hi, this is Sharon.  I'm on the East Coast.
L:  Hi, uh, Sharon.  This is Karen.  I'm in the Midwest. 
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Sharon and Karen.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  Okay.  I guess we're supposed to talk about what's the most important thing in a life partner.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, okay.  You wanna start?  [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.
R:  Okay.
L:  They have to be alive.  [LAUGH]
R:  Huh?  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Alive.  Right.  Okay.  This is true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  This is true.
L:  You should have something in common with them --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, and a good sense of humor and adaptable and --
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LAUGH] not manipulative.
R:  Exactly.  Right.  Right.
L:  So, what -- what else do you think?
R:  Well, now for me, um, the first thing I'm hoping for a lifelong partner they have to, um, uh -- they have to deal with life from a spiritual point of view for me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, I'm a born again Christian so they gotta deal with life through God's point of view.
L:  Mhm.
R:  For me and, um, they have to love God first, love themselves second, love me third.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They have to have good self esteem, um, I have to deal with the character, you know, see what kinda character they have --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, then from there we can see.  I gotta make sure I don't any signs of, um -- any -- any signs in advance of, uh -- of domestic abuse, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- coming down the road, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  Um, what else?  Um, if -- if -- well, I guess we should have a lot in common, but we should be able to be at a point in our lives where we can compromise.
L:  You bet.
R:  You know, 'cause, um, especially ...
L:  And have some time of your own also.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You know?  And, um, I'm in the arts, so whoever I hook up with they have to understand a person like myself in the arts --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's -- that's kinda like not -- you know, uh, a lotta people don't understand that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], what else?  [MN]
L:  And I'm in the sciences.  So --
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
L:  -- education, especially science education --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- is extremely important to me.
R:  Exactly.  I would like the person that I'm gonna live with for the rest of my life to be, um -- come from the same cultural background and I would like for them to be educated.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, um, formal education really would help because I've been people who are not formally ed- educated.  They're smart.  They're extremely smart.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we've gotta be able to hold a conversation.
L:  You bet.
R:  You know?  Um, they have to be stimulating for me mentally.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, they have to -- they have to like to read.
L:  Yes.
R:  They have to like to read because I have so many friends who don't like to read and it's just so dah to have -- to have a conver- ...
L:  Yeah.  It's strange.  You wonder how they function.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Uh, you can't have a conversation with them.  I just let them talk [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause you really can't have a conversation with them 'cause they don't read anything, you know?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Um, and I can't -- that's pretty much it for me, you know?  Oh, and whoever it is they have to keep the toilet seat down.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That alone gives ground for divorce.  If I keep coming in the bathroom and the toilet seat's up that's ground for divorce.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, what else?  Uh, they have to like to go -- well, not -- they don't have to like to, but they have to feel an obligation or commitment to, uh, uh, go to church.
L:  Oh.
R:  I don't care which day it is.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just as long as they have a commitment to -- to go to church and, uh ...
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  And I -- I guess that's kind of for starters.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  For starters, yeah.
L:  It's strange, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to try to look for a life partner.  I've found at my age that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I don't look anymore --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because if it's gonna happen it happens unexpectedly.
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm not looking at all.  I'm -- I'm engrossed in what I'm doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and I said, um -- you know, as -- as I'm doing what I'm doing if I meet someone along the way I'm -- I'll attract somebody who's attracted to what I'm doing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and ...  Yeah.  And I'd like to be friends first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I'd like to be friends first.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's real important.
R:  Yeah.  You know?
L:  That's what most kids don't understand.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, 'cause ...
L:  They -- they let their emotions run away with them and then --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- there's nothing left after a while.
R:  Exactly. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I find that some of my best male friends have been the ones after the relationship is over --
L:  Mhm.  That's right.
R:  -- you know, after -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I -- I decided from here on in if we're gonna take it -- we'd be friends first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No sex whatsoever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  None of that, you know?  To be friends, get to know each other first, get to ...  I have to try my best to get to know them in all kinds of situations.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That I wouldn't ...
L:  You want a companion.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that I -- I wanna see them when they get angry over something so I have an idea how they're gonna react.
L:  How they're gonna react.  Yeah.
R:  Different kinds -- different kinds of anger, you know?
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  How they react under stress --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, 'cause I want -- I wanna know and then whoever I'm -- I'm staying with for the rest of my life, um, I just gotta sit back and watch how they treat their mother and their sister.
L:  Oh, you bet.
R:  You know?  If I see any negative stuff going on that -- you know, that's unreasonable --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm -- I'm -- I -- I can't handle it.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  Uh, and I know it's a long list of stuff, but [LAUGH] after having been around the men a little bit ...
L:  Yeah.  That's right.
R:  Yeah, you know, I'm like okay --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I ain't bullshitting no more [LAUGH], you know?  Uh ...
L:  Yeah, you don't need the hassle in your life.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.
L:  After a while you've --
R:  No.
L:  -- been through it.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know?
L:  Yep.
R:  So, now I'm -- I'm -- I'm really focusing on, you know, my career, what I'm doing, and I'm -- I'm happy, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've got what -- I'm at a point where I'm kinda -- I'm happy to be single, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's almost like oh, get married to who?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  I don't flip the kite and I'm happy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  That's kinda how I am too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't want anybody putting conditions on me.
R:  That's it.  Yeah.
L:  I'm kinda, um, an activist in many different areas --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't want somebody saying, "Oh, you shouldn't do that" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or you shouldn't ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know, let those people be in --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and go solve their own problems or ...
R:  Right.
L:  You don't have to go out and, you know, yell at people who wear fur or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you don't have to go out and do all those kinds of things and --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- I think okay I don't need you.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  You know, even if they don't agree with you they support you, know, in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in what you're doing because, um, you know, they wanna just make -- make -- let you know that you've got support.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  They don't have to go and do it with me --
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- just don't, uh ...  Yeah, supportive, people that you need.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  So ...
L:  But a life partner that's -- that's scares me.  I mean, I've -- I've been married twice.  Two and a half times.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I -- I'm not doing it again.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is -- it is kinda scary because I figure, you know, I wouldn't wanna live with my -- my -- my -- my family the rest of my life.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, so a total stranger that you get to know over, you know, maybe a year or so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like life, for the rest of my life, you know --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- and -- and through thick and thin, through richer or poorer, I don't know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's so scary when you really sit down and -- and contemplate it.  It's a little bit scary.
L:  And the older you get --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the harder it is for you to, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to make, uh, accommodations for someone else.
R:  Exactly.  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is -- it's really true.
L:  You're used to doing it your way and that's the way it should be.
R:  That's it.  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And I've gotten to know myself in a way 'cause I'm, uh -- I've -- I've -- I've come to understand that I'm a selfish person.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm aware of it.  I tend to indulge myself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And, um, I'm -- I'm able to, um, not be selfish with other people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I leave room to be selfish for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so it's kinda, you know -- it's a little bit ...  And usually I -- I think sometimes if ya tend to be selfish -- I notice it myself -- I tend to have friends who are selfish, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's -- when I see them doing certain things I just have to say okay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, you know, I know my thing too.  So, just them alone and let them do their thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So, it's interesting.  It's, uh, real interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You -- you know?  I think people get married like in their teens or something they got a way to go.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, even if the marriage doesn't last over the years I know they -- they've been through some storms.
L:  Mhm.  That's right.
R:  I know that they've been through storms.  Yeah.  So ...
L:  I was listening to, uh, um, an interview with, um [LIPSMACK] -- oh, heck, what's the old actor that just died?
R:  Oh, Hugh Cronin.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he was talking about his marriage with Jessica Dandy --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and how long they had been together --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and just everything that they had in common --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and things that they didn't.
R:  Yes.  Right.
L:  And they just supported each other --
R:  That's it.
L:  -- and that was the whole key.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And you have to be able to -- be able to compromise, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on the things where you don't have -- and I -- I think it's -- it's good to know before the marriage -- that's why ya gotta try to know the person well enough the marriage -- to know if there's something there that you know you absolutely don't wanna compromise on --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- it's something that you've really gotta think about.
L:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
R:  You know?  You really have to think about that, you know?  Um, yeah, it's just -- it's -- it's hard, it's hard, and, um, you know, I would like to do a lotta things, hobbies and everything, and traveling that I'd like to do before I would get into a marriage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, um, after I get married that w- -- I want that to be my prime focus --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I think it's -- you know, it's nice to be able to say a woman of the nineties can do all this and that, but for me personally I think it's hard to concentrate on so many different things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and I -- I would -- I'm not into feminism at all.  I'm like I wanna do one thing at a time, enjoy it, then move on to the next thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] You know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh, I'm enjoying my -- you know, what I'm doing now for a living and when I decide to get married I'm gonna focus on that.  You know what I mean?
L:  That's cool.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  You know?  So, my energy's not scattered all over the place and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, just ...  I -- I would imagine it would wear me out.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it would just wear me out and I -- I'm not trying to be a power woman at all. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, but it does wear you out because you have to put so much into a relationship --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to keep it fresh and going.
