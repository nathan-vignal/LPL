L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name's Linda.
R:  Hi, Linda, my name is Cathy.
L:  Hi Cathy, where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Illinois.
L:  Illinois.  So I'm in San Diego.
R:  Oh how nice.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  It must be beautiful out there.
L:  Ah, we've got our -- our June gloom, but yeah, it's okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's awesome.
L:  It's cloudy but it's still like, seventy one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's about the same here only, um, clear skies.
L:  Mm.  I see.  Well this is a funny subject for me because California has its own minimum wage.
R:  Oh does it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it the same price?
L:  No, it's up to six twenty five.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That is great.
L:  I think it'll be up to six ninety five by the end of this year, or next year, I'm not sure.
R:  Great.  I -- I know that here in Illinois they have -- they're -- they are -- I think there's a bill in the congress to increase the minimum wage.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And so that is something that needs -- desperately needs to happen, I feel, because, um, it's i- -- with everything increasing, with gasoline increasing in price and -- and, you know, food increasing and -- and -- and rent and everything increasing in our area, I feel it's necessary.
L:  Oh, yeah, def- --
R:  Just to have it, um, increased just so that people can live.
L:  I agree.  I think -- I agree, I think it should be, you know, what the -- well, shoot it up to, what, five fifty?
R:  Five fifteen.
L:  Five fifteen.
R:  I think is where it started at.
L:  Oh.  Yeah, uh, defin- -- well, like I said, being here in California it's -- it's up higher anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So in --
R:  And see, I don't know about in -- in, uh, San Diego but here in Illinois they did away with the whole DCSS program and it was a program where, you know, single moms could get money and living expenses and -- and food stamps and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they've done away with all this so that there is no more case workers or anything like that dealing with it.  They had a, um, t- To Work program, where in a year they would send you to school or do whatever you had but in a year you had to f- -- uh, within a certain time you had to have a job.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know.  So a lot of the women went to work for Burger King and were -- were, um, you know, it -- it came up on that, you know, the bare necessities, they were not even provided for.  The girl brought in paperwork saying, you know, to a case worker, "This is how much it costs to live -- and this is without a phone or a car -- and this is how much money will come in if I work at Burger King, and it's not enough money".
L:  [MN]
R:  And it ended up the girl lost her apartment and all of her furnishings and everything and had to be homeless.
L:  Oh no.
R:  And so I -- I -- you know, with that story I remember, and it was a true story, I really truly believe that in order for people to feel good about themselves they have to make enough money just to survive.
L:  I agree, definitely.  Yeah, it needs to be higher, you know, just l- like you said, the cost of -- of living, gasoline and -- and, uh, food and everything else.  I know, especially here, the -- the gas is so much higher than everywhere else anyway, [LAUGH] we pay --
R:  What is the price of your gas out there?
L:  Um, one sixty five a gallon, one --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- seventy five a gallon?
R:  That's about what it is here.  It's like --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- one fifty seven.  If you go to more of the expensive places it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one sixty five.
L:  Okay.  It just varies where you go but I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they were having the -- the crunch and they said it's -- ours is on the rise again, and they were just talking on the news, the guy said, "Yeah, I was back east somewhere and the gas price is about forty -- forty cents cheaper".
R:  Wow.
L:  "A gallon".  And I went, "Oh!"  But ...
R:  Yeah, we're, um, where I'm at I'm about forty five minutes from the Indiana border --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you can save twenty to thirty cents a gallon, you know, if you go halfway into the Indiana border, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, it's -- it's really something about this minimum wage, it really affects everybody.
L:  It does.
R:  Um, I mean, before, people used to live with their families and things like that and so, you know, they -- they moved out of the house and -- and -- and started their own families and it used to be, remember how mom stayed at home and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm, yeah, I remember that.
R:  Now it's -- now it's a two pay check family and even with two pay checks, if -- that sometimes isn't enough to -- to support a family of three or four.
L:  I agree.
R:  Yeah.  So I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I really do believe that this -- this, um, increase needs to happen.  And wasn't there a woman that, um, she went undercover and tried to live in one of these towns, one of these small towns, and live on minimum wage?  And she said it was utterly impossible, you know.
L:  Um, I don't remember that story but I, yeah, I would think it would be tr- -- you know, definitely would be hard to do, especially if you don't have family backing you up and helping you out and ...
R:  Correct.
L:  I agree, you know, definitely that's gotta be, you know, it needs to be higher.  Even for people who just, you know, are trying to put themselves through school or work part time and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] You gotta be able to -- to afford it because they're not gonna drop bus fares and they're not gonna ga- drop gasoline or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- electricity or anything of that -- that -- th- those prices aren't coming back down.
R:  Yeah.  And then a lot of the families, um, that are doing minimum wage are, um, in our area a lot of the Mexican families who have come across the border to work because in our area we didn't have enough teenagers that would accept jobs, you know, at minimum wage.
L:  Right.
R:  So, um, we've got a little bit of a crunch going on where -- and then if these -- in -- in Illinois I think over fifty five percent of the families have divorced, so women who were, um, taken care of and had a husband that went t- to -- to his job and she stayed at home and -- and took care of the house and the children, she's now faced with finding a job.
L:  Mm.
R:  So we have these displaced homemakers also who are out there and -- and so much of the -- the stresses on women now because of the men not paying child support here in Illinois.
L:  Yeah, that's a --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- problem all the way around, yes.
R:  Is it -- is this the same thing in California?
L:  Yeah.  There's a lot of single families.  There's a lot with being -- well, right here next to the border we have a lot of people cross the border every day to come in here to work.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Because not only do you get, you know, at least, what did I say, six twenty five minimum wage?  And then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they get the benefits on top of it.  They just have to sit usually an hour or so in the line to get across the border. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, they deal with that or they take the bus and stuff.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  But yeah, there's a lot of single f- -- single moms and single families and -- I'm a single mom and I know it's difficult.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And some of the other guidelines like, I know my daughter's in school and stuff and s- the guideline sometimes are so low for her to get extra help like for -- to get reduced lunches.
R:  Oh definitely.
L:  Like, I mean, I make a modest income but I -- with even just the two of us I make too much for her to get free lunch.
R:  That is ridiculous.
L:  And so, you know.  I guess it's -- if these people who really -- who make that amount -- that little amount of money really need the free lunch then I guess I should look at it a different way. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, i- it's hard because as single moms -- I'm also a single mom -- and, um, you know, we're always looking at ways to, you know, increase, you know, the income coming into the house.
L:  Right.
R:  And unfortunately -- and fortunately we have a father that is involved in my daughter's life and is very, you know, much into paying his child support, um, so we're very appreciative of that where, um, we just set it up through the courts, so I don't even have to deal with saying, you know, "Where's your child support at this week?" you know.
L:  Mhm.  That's how I have mine set up too but, um, there's still instan- -- my -- my ex was out of work for a whole year.
R:  Oh w- --
L:  And he wasn't drawing unemp- -- he wa- -- he didn't draw on, claim it, the first six, eight months of it.  So I got nothing.
R:  Wow.
L:  Or I got one little bit he decided to throw to the courts to give down to me, so yeah, I know how that is, it's -- and he's -- now he's back to work but he's working one day a week.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  So [LAUGH] -- supposedly! [LAUGH]
R:  That's so hard.
L:  It is. But --
R:  That has to really be difficult.
L:  It does make life difficult.
R:  Definitely.
L:  But, like, [inaudible] said, you need -- you need that income, you need that minimum wage.
R:  Yeah.  And I -- and I truly, um, look on our people that -- that do work for minimum wage, you know, that's gotta be very difficult for them, um, to be bringing in a little -- little bit of money but not a lot of money, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, um --
L:  And the jobs that pay minimum wage are the ones that most people don't want anyway.
R:  Definitely.
L:  For -- for the job or for, you know, the atmosphere or something else like that.
R:  Yeah.  And a lotta people, you know, like -- like, the minimum wage job may be at a McDonald's or something like that, you know, and they're like, "I don't wanna work at McDonald's around that greasy food or ..."
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  You know, "Or -- or work with a bunch of kids".
L:  Mm.
R:  "I wanna work with adults" you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And so -- and then i- if you have or you've gone to college and then you, you know, have, um, you know, gone and -- and now you want to ge- take your college, you know, degree, and do something with it, you know, that a lotta people look at, "What is your education?  What have you done?  What, you know, what is your work experience, basically?"
L:  Right, McDonald's.
R:  "You have the education but show us what you did in work" you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you have to be a little creative there. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  This is true.
R:  But I -- I --
L:  This
