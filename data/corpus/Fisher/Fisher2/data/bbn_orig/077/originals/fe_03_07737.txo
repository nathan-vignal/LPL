L:  Hello?
R:  Uh, yes.  Hi.
L:  How are you doing?
R:  Oh, fine.
L:  I'm Susan.
R:  You -- you must be on a speakerphone, huh?
L:  No, I'm on a cell phone, but ...
R:  Oh, a cell phone, okay.  Um, my name is Sharon.  What -- what is your name?
L:  Susan.
R:  Susan?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi.  Uh, I ...
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Okay.  Uh, are we supposed to wait for our topic or have we heard it already?
L:  She said the ...
R:  Oh, the minimum wage, okay.
L:  Yeah, about the minimum being --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- five fifteen.
R:  Yeah.  Uh [LAUGH] ...
L:  I think it's kinda low myself.
R:  Uh, yeah.  I -- I don't think anyone can actually survive on that amount of money, you know?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  So, I think ...
L:  I don't live in -- I don't live in a big city.  I live in a little town, but --
R:  You do, huh?
L:  -- um, the bigger -- what I've been told is bigger cities make a lot in pay.  Of course, the -- the -- the -- the --
R:  The expenses are higher.
L:  -- expenses are higher.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, the expenses are high everywhere.
R:  Right.  But even in a small town I don't think five fifteen an hour would go very far.
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] It doesn't.
R:  [LAUGH] If you, uh -- especially if you're the only wage earner for instance.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If -- if it's -- if it's five fifteen an hour most likely both adults in the household have to work --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in order to make it because you've got medical supplies you've gotta worry about and food and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the kids -- clothes for your kids and stuff like that and you just can't do it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I -- I would think in this day and age, you know, a minimum wage of like seven dollars an hour or something like that would be more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in line with -- with the --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- cost of living, you know?  Five fifteen for, uh, uh, a young, uh, sixteen year old starting out working ...
L:  Yeah.  And like in the fast food joint where they just get outta high school and stuff.
R:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  So ...
L:  But ...
R:  And they're living at home an everything like that, you know, uh, obviously their -- their money's not used to pay a lot of the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- different expenses.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, here -- I live in Louisiana --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, um ...
R:  I can tell you have a little accent.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I've been here for years.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm originally from Pennsylvania.  So ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um, down here it's just -- it's bad.  The economy is bad.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Everything is bad.  You can't find a job anywhere.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's not too good up in the north here either.  I -- I live in Minnesota.  So, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's not much better.
L:  But I bet ya your weather's better.
R:  Uh, right now I think so.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it -- but it was -- you know, in January I think I -- I might change my mind about that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's humid down here.
R:  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in town now if you're -- you're a guy and you go look for like a labor position --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they usually start you out at six bucks an hour here.
R:  Uh-huh.  A basic --
L:  But ...
R:  -- labor position?
L:  Yeah.
R:  With- without any training though?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  But ...
R:  Well, I know, uh, like, uh, if somebody's taking a job as a waitress or something where there are gratuities, tips involved, you know, they'll -- they'll even, uh, pay them less than minimum wage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know they get around that, but they do.
L:  I know that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my sister was a waitress and she was only getting paid two dollars and something cents an hour.
R:  Oh, my goodness!  But did she ...?
L:  Plus she had -- she had to share her tips. 
R:  Oh, my.  Did she make enough then or ...?
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, she -- I guess -- I guess she just talked to the manager or someone after working there for about four months and asked --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if she could get paid minimum wage and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with the tips and he went ahead and agreed to it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because she -- you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, uh, obviously, you know, unless you're making really good tips --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're not gonna make a great amount of money.
L:  And it's not a big place.  It's just a small little place and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's -- it's good tips, but not all the time good tips, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.  I -- I don't know they get around that actually, you know, um --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- but ...
L:  -- I don't understand it either because they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you have -- if you have to split the tips then you should get paid minimum wage.
R:  Right.  Right.  Uh, that's an addition, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- obviously because minimum wage is not -- well, when -- when we're talking five fifteen an hour we're talking a forty hour week, we're talking a little over two hundred dollars before taxes and then after taxes, I mean, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It cuts it down some.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, you know, in the city I live in I -- I mean, you can't even rent an apartment, a one bedroom apartment for less than six hundred.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, obviously you -- you -- and -- and, you know, in the winter would be, uh, kinda cold to use a tent.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, we own a trailer.  We own a -- we live in, uh, one trailer and we own another trailer --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, it's a twelve by eighty or it's twelve by sixty, something like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- two bedroom and we rent it out for a hundred dollars --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because we know how hard it is for people to -- to actually --
R:  To find ...
L:  -- trying to find something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But the property's not ours so we have to add a fifty dollar -- fifty dollars on to that.  So, actually it's only a hundred fifty dollars that we rent that trailer out for --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and right now it's being used.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, I would think so.  That's -- that's really reasonable rent.  Yeah.  Are ...?
L:  I mean, peop- people around here their -- their -- their prices are so high and you can't afford it because you don't make enough money.
R:  Are -- are there, uh, apartments available though or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Um ...
R:  But -- but they're expensive I assume?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think you can get an apartment down here for about two fifty --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- a one -- a one bedroom apartment --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for about two fifty.
R:  So that's ...
L:  That's not including utilities.
R:  Yeah.  That sounds reasonable to me.  [LAUGH]  But, you know, obviously, you know, as you said, wages are lower in -- in your town too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, you have to look at everything.  Yeah.  And obviously, you know, if you're, uh, making minimum wage well, then we're talking -- you're probably getting, um, oh, probably, um ...
L:  That is if you get forty hours a week.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Right.  Well, you're -- you're probably getting six hundred a month or something, you know, seven hundred.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  And two fifty of it going for rent and then think of all the other things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in addition to that, you know?  It's just, uh -- yeah.
L:  It's -- it's bad all around and I -- I keep getting these surveys on the Internet, do you think the economy's getting worse, better, or the same?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's getting worse.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah.  I -- I think so.  I think that, you know, there needs to be a balance.  I mean, I -- I remember reading about, you know, Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream when they started out.  I think they've sold it now.  But, uh, like the [COUGH] lowest person on the scale got about twenty five thousand and then the highest person got like a hundred thousand, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's -- that's so different from a lotta these big corporations, you know, where the, uh -- the C.E.O. is getting four million or something with all the benefits, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then people are getting laid off on their end or -- or like, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- getting minimum wage it doesn't -- it doesn't make any sense.  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Our -- our town down here it's strange.  It won't let any other companies in -- in to build.
R:  Uh-huh.  You have like one major company that's, uh --
L:  Well --
R:  -- that's kinda got a monopoly in or ...?
L:  -- the mayor doesn't like -- the mayor wants to have a hometown.  He doesn't want to let -- he doesn't wanna let new companies in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to build and I don't understand why not because then that would produce more jobs for the people and they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- wouldn't have to be on welfare so much.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But I don't know what his reasoning is not letting -- because ...
R:  So, the mayor sounds like a dictator.  I mean [LAUGH], you know, is there a city council or something too though?
L:  Um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he just -- he owns just about everything in town.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, that's why he doesn't want any other business.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He doesn't want no competition.  [LAUGH]
R:  Wow!  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  But we, um -- we have an industrial park and the only thing in -- in it is, um, a place that makes trailers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that's it.  He won't let anybody else in --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- and it's like a -- I don't know how many acres it is, it takes up a whole bunch of room and --
R:  Yeah.   So, there's additional spacing for ...
L:  -- it's just going to waste because --
R:  Yeah.  That's strange.
L:  -- somebody could build in there and they're not building.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's strange.  Yeah.  Because obviously, you know, it would help the economy of your -- your town, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It would.
R:  Uh ...
L:  Um, but I just -- five fifteen an hour -- I can't remember when it was the last time it ...
R:  Yeah.  Uh, five fifteen I thought that was, you know ...?
L:  It's been a while.
R:  Yeah.  They haven't raised it recently have they or ...?
L:  I thought it was supposed to go like from -- what was the last thing, four seventy five --
R:  Oh, gee.
L:  -- or four eighty five?
R:  I don't -- I don't recall.
L:  And then I thought it was supposed to go to five fifteen and then five twenty five.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  But I never saw five twenty five.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It -- it just sounds -- you know, it just sounds like it's ...
L:  And when they do raise it that's all they raise it is ten or fifteen cents.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, what's that --
R:  That doesn't --
L:  -- what's that gonna do?
R:  -- that doesn't help.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Huh.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I ...
R:  In -- in our city too, you know, uh, well, we've got a huge deficit, you know, just like the -- the federal government.  But they've cut back on, um, bus services, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and a lotta p- -- the people that, you know, make the minimum wage obviously take the bus.  I -- I take the bus myself and -- and where I live they don't even have bus service on the weekend and fortunately I like to walk, you know?
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I can walk --
