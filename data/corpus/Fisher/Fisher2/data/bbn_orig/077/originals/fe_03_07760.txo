L:  Hi, this is Wayne Dalton, calling from Duluth, Minnesota.
R:  Hi, I'm Nancy from Atlanta, Georgia.
L:  How are you doing this evening?
R:  Fine, fine.  How are you?
L:  Pretty good.  I wouldn't normally be calling this on a Friday night, but I'm getting ready to run Grandma's marathon tomorrow morning.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, you're -- uh, let's see, it's -- er, it's nine thirty here.  What is it there?
L:  Eight thirty.
R:  Eight thirty, okay [LAUGH].
L:  So ...
R:  So, you're trying to be good to stay in to, uh, be in shape for it, huh?
L:  Exactly --
R:  Oh, well --
L:  -- staying in tonight, and just getting some rest.
R:  Well, good, good.
L:  But, um --
R:  Well --
L:  -- wanna give a call.  I understand the topic of the day is minimum wage and whether five fifteen an hour is sufficient or not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  It -- it's, um -- I tell you what, I remember when it went up to two ten an hour and I was so excited.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm in the same boat.
R:  [LAUGH] I remember being paid -- I think it was like it went up like, um, [LIPSMACK], twenty cents or some- -- I can't remember.  It was quite a jump though, and I do remember I thought, "Oh, my God, this is so great".  Now, mind you, I was probably sixteen and [SIGH] -- and when you're sixteen anything is, uh, is pretty good -- or at least it was, let me put it that way.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, I don't know.  Five fifteen an hour's -- sure doesn't sound like much.  And then you'd have taxes on top of it, but on the other hand, I suppose, you know, you -- you do have to start somewhere.  
L:  Yeah, and I know a lot of people [LIPSMACK], or at least where I live in Chicago, um, you know, they -- they're getting hired for much more than five fifteen an hour.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If there are jobs available.
R:  Exactly --
L:  And ...
R:  -- exactly.  I mean, where -- where I work, um, you know, we are -- we start people off at, um, [LIPSMACK] nine something an hour.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, that's -- that's -- and then that goes on up from there, so, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  It's -- there are -- that -- that's just it, there are jobs out there, and you know -- I don't know.  Personally, I guess I think that five fifteen an hour for starting, you know, it -- it -- there has to be a baseline.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's been increasing over the years, um, if they wanna decrease taxes instead of increase [NOISE] minimum wage, that would help everybody.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I agree. 
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, I also teach economics, so --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I've seen, you know, both sides of the argument on minimum wages as well [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  That, um, you know, in times when things are going great, nobody gets paid the minimum wage anyway, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it really doesn't matter.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] but the opposite argument is that in times of weakness, like we're in right now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is the minimum wage causing people to be out of work that might otherwise be employed if -- you know, if they could earn, say, four seventy five an hour.  And that's one thing that I have my students discuss.
R:  Is that what it is right now?  Four seventy five?
L:  No, it's actually five fifteen.
R:  It is five fifteen. O- -- I -- I --
L:  But --
R:  -- couldn't even have told you what it was.
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, you know, if it was lower, could you be employing more people, instead of having this floor and saying that, "You know, look, you have to pay at least this much".
R:  I don't know.  Because, I mean, the way I would think about that is it depends on who the people are.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, okay, if you hire, you know, two people at four seventy five, and yes, now you have two people, um, but you have somebody at five fifteen [NOISE] -- I guess I'm th- -- I'm thinking more the quality of the worker --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- versus, you know [MN], one against two sometimes doesn't make, you know, doesn't matter.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, [NOISE] yeah, I d- -- what do your students say? [NOISE]
L:  Well, we're kinda split, because obviously they're just entering the workforce, they have part time jobs and they make that amount.
R:  [NOISE] Do they?
L:  Yeah, and they think it's adequate for them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you know, for them it's okay, but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, families working --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it probably isn't okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean five fifteen an hour, what is that?  Ten thousand bucks a year?  You know, ho- --
R:  Pro- -- yeah, maybe.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Maybe.  [SIGH] I mean, but I guess and the way I look at it again too, is, you know, you are -- you're a teacher, you've done something with yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You've -- you've, you know, gotten above that minimum wage standard, and for a family to be earning five fifteen an hour [SIGH], um, if they don't give it their all and try to make more --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they will always be there, so why should they be supplemented?
L:  Yeah.
R:  As, you know, without merit.  
L:  Mhm.  [MN] Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah, and that's -- that's a side of the argument I usually come down on as well.  [MN] I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's one thing to give a training wage, or to give kids this wage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, if -- if adults wanna earn that, fine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if they wanna do something with their lives, you go at it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Don't --
R:  Ex- --
L:  -- complain to -- don't complain --
R:  Exactly.  And -- and then you don't have to worry about that minimum wage any more.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And -- and again, you stay at minimum wage, you're at some place, if you're a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- great worker, you may very well get a -- a bonus and a raise quicker than the next.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Depending on, you know, what the company is and the -- the, um, standard is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, yeah.
L:  [MN] Yeah, and that's -- you know, yeah, it -- it's interesting that they left the question that narrow.  Um, because if they said, you know, "Is the minimum wage right or not?" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that probably, you know, would have opened it up for much more discussion.
R:  Yeah, it definitely would, wouldn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean -- but [MN] I don't know, I mean, is it right or not?  If we were to ask that question ourselves.  I mean, I guess again I think that should everybody be given the opportunity to -- to decide their own wages?  Would most people -- I mean, I know several people who have their own businesses [SIGH] and they don't start at minimum wage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because they do want to attract [NOISE] higher quality --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- workers.  So --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- you know, if you're going to start at the minimum wage, I suppose you have your factory workers and things like that, uh, I -- you know.
L:  Well, let me ask you this.  Um, you know, it's a federal law, um, I got out of business school about four years ago, and most of my friends coming out of there were taking consulting jobs.  It didn't matter where you went in the country; they were paying you the same amount of money.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, [MN] y- you can't tell me that the cost of living in New York City is --
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  -- equal to the cost of living in the Twin Cities.
R:  Right.
L:  So, is it really fair to have a federal minimum wage, or should there be different minimum wages for different parts of the country?
R:  No, I -- I don't think that -- I definitely don't think so on that.
L:  Okay.
R:  I think there should be one minimum wage.  And the reason I think that is because the -- the government has not said, "You must work here, you must live here".
L:  Mhm.
R:  If people know that they live in New York and -- and they're still living there knowing that, um, they might be able to get someplace else and live someplace else for a lot less.  I mean, I live in Atlanta for a reason.
L:  Mm.
R:  And part of the reason is the cost of living.  It is fairly inexpensive.  I had been asked with my job to be moved to San Francisco [SIGH].  I said, "Sure, find me a two hundred and -- you know, find me a twenty five hundred square foot house".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  "I don't care what the cost is, just find me a twenty five hundred square foot house and -- and I'll move in".  
L:  Yes.
R:  But I'm not lowering my standards just to move someplace else.  So, see, it was my choice.  And -- and again, I think the same thing [SIGH].  There -- there's a -- a federal rule, but just because, um, it is more expensive to live in one place anoth- -- even in Atlanta it's more expensive to live in the city of Atlanta as opposed to the suburbs, so --
L:  Well.
R:  -- should the city of Atlanta be a higher minimum wage pay? 
L:  No.
R:  You know, it's, um, no, I don't think so.  
L:  Yeah, an- and then you come down to the plan of how would you be able to figure out what it should be?
R:  Right.
L:  And [MN] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you get politicians involved in that, it's getting --
R:  Oh, exactly.
L:  -- [MN] even bigger mess.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, you know, I -- [SIGH] I think that, um, [LIPSMACK] [MN] I would like to think that you should be able to leave it up to private enterprise to come up with their own, um, wage scales.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it's their business.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And not to have the federal government included in it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, on the other hand, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, it's -- should there even be one?  I mean, you're right, that's -- that's -- that's a much, much broader topic than is it just -- is it -- should it be raised to five fifteen [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  We kinda got off that though, didn't we [LAUGH]?
L:  Well, I mean, [MN] --
R:  It is still.
L:  I mean, considering the topic I think we did a pretty good job --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, as far as discussing some of the merits that other people might not have discussed.
R:  Right.
L:  Um --
R:  What do you think?
L:  [MN] I really don't think there should be a minimum wage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- period.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think it should be up to private --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- private businesses to determine how much people wanna get paid.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, [MN] really -- it's almost like rent controls in New York city, where you cap the amount of rent that individuals are paying --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you -- you -- government price controls do not work in the long run.
R:  No, I agree with you there.
L:  Um, people are always gonna find ways to cheat it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just like with the income tax code.
R:  Right.
L:  Every time a new tax package is passed, accountants, lawyers, et cetera, come up with ways to figure out how to get around it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know, because I do some of that on the side [LAUGH].
R:  Sure, but -- but, sure, but that's -- yeah, that's exactly right.  Get rid of the entire income tax system.
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, and -- and have a fair sales tax.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean that -- that's personally what I think it should be.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  You know, you -- you pay taxes on what you buy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, you know?  
L:  Right.
R:  Not -- not on the money that you earn.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we'd all be buying a lot more.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Because right now, you get penalized to save and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah, just doesn't make sense.
R:  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't -- I -- I agree with you on that -- that boat.  
L:  Mm.
R:  That's for darn sure.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  E- e- even though my taxes are being reduced, it could be reduced a lot more.
L:  Yeah -- I feel --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the same way.  I -- I lived in Wisconsin --
R:  Pardon me?   
L:  -- um, right up --
