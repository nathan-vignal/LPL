L:  Hi, I'm Alex.
R:  Hi, I'm Janet.  How are you today?
L:  Pretty good.
R:  Ah, yeah, where are you from?
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  Ah, [several inaudible words], New York.
L:  Okay.
R:  All right, ah, minimum wage.  No, it's definitely too low.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  I don't see how anybody, whether they're single or a family or what have you can get by on that pay.
L:  Yeah.  Down where I live, um, the newspaper published once that it was, ah, um, it would take like eleven dollars and some odd cents an hour just to get by in Philadelphia.
R:  I know, and this is, like, ah, less than half.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's ridiculous.
L:  And, um, before I got laid off I was making [MN] -- I was making, like, ten an hour plus full benefits and bonuses and I still couldn't afford to pay rent.
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I wish we were making that ten an hour.
L:  [NOISE] I know, I mean it's just -- it's ridiculous and then I had, um, there were so many employees that worked there with fa- families that were making, you know, minimum wage or a little bit above minimum wage and it just wasn't cutting for them.  They were working two, three jobs.
R:  You have to in this day and age.  Both husband and wife both have to work and even then, by the time you pay for childcare, what do you have? 
L:  Yeah, that's all [several inaudible words] if you have children, ah, I don't -- I don't know how people do it.  It -- I mean, it's -- I guess it's just a -- a sad fact of how greedy people are in this country.
R:  That explains too why people do this thing, like Fisher study, in order to make a couple of extra bucks just to put bread and milk in the mouth.
L:  Yeah, I'm like, you know, huh, it's just -- ah, and I -- I mean, I see like, um, on TV and I see in the newspapers -- like, I live in a metropolitan area where, you know, work is -- it's -- it's hard to get but it's a lot easier than in some places like -- I'm not -- I'm n- -- I'm familiar with New York.  Do you live in New York state?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, um, h- how is it up there?  Is it, like, no jobs anywhere?
R:  No.  That's why we're losing more and more people.  I don't know if you've been, ah, catching the paper about Buffalo, how a major city Buffalo [MN] -- they're driving people out left and right because everything's so expensive.  There are no jobs and the jobs there are it's all minimum wage, if that, you know, I mean, even your wait- waitresses don't even get minimum wage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause they depend on their tips.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But, if people don't tip because they can't afford it 'cause they don't earn enough money, they get screwed too.
L:  Yeah, and I mean -- I mean, it did -- it doesn't look like there's any, um, end in sight because, um, I believe Clinton raised it from five seventy five to -- I mean, four seventy five to five fifteen and -- 
R:  Which isn't --  
L:  -- that was like nothing.
R:  I know, it's -- it is.  It's nothing.  Actually -- actually it's nothing.
L:  I mean, [LAUGH] you can't even buy a pack of cigarettes where I live for that, so I mean -- 
R:  [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] -- 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I -- I hate to tell ya.
L:  Yeah, and I mean -- I mean, people and it's -- what's about it is the -- ah, around here we have really bad education, [several inaudible words] system in our schools and stuff.  And people, like -- and every year they cut funding even more and more and more and less teaches and less books and less everything and -- 
R:  And they're -- 
L:  -- just -- 
R:  -- closing schools left and right out here.
L:  Yeah.  And we have so many people in the city who don't even go to school -- who don't -- don't even graduate from high school, who don't even, like, fin- finish a year of high school.
R:  'Cause they figure, "What's the point?"  Even if you go to college there's no jobs out there.
L:  Yeah.  And then I have all -- I have all these friends that decided, you know, "I'm going to join the military" you know, and start up -- my brother did.  My sister's going to.  And you know, they get out [MN] of the military and they -- they can only get minimum wage jobs because everything -- 
R:  It -- it -- 
L:  -- they've been taught really doesn't have anything to do with anything outside the military.
R:  I hear you loud and clear.
L:  Yeah, and it's -- 
R:  So, what -- what do you do for -- oh, you're laid off but what do you do for a living?
L:  I was a mechanic.  I just, um, I -- I didn't even study to do that.  I just -- I started one day as a, um, a gas pumper at a gas station and two years' later I had my licenses and the state inspection licenses.  I, um, you know, I did it that way, the old start from the bottom.  And then, um, the company I was working for which is, um, Geddy[?] which is from New York, um, they just -- they closed down the, um, the franchises so we were all -- 
R:  Oh -- 
L:  -- out of business.
R:  I didn't know Geddy was from New York.
L:  Ah, well, that's where we got our, um, our fuel from.  That's where the main offices were.
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  Yeah, they're in, um -- I th- -- [SIGH] I think White -- maybe White Plains.
R:  Could be.
L:  I don't know.  But, ah, yeah, we -- and they just, ah, they decided that they -- I mean, things were killing them because they're a full service only down here and they, ah, they just couldn't handle it so they -- I mean, I think almost three hundred people lost their jobs out of nowhere.  We had no warning or anything.
R:  Well, I think minimum wage, whatever it is, is definitely too low no matter where you live.  And I think cost of living should be equal all over -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- therefore minimum wage should be equal all over.  I mean, you go to other places their cost of living is much higher therefore their minimum wage is higher.
L:  Yes.  I mean, it also is to do with industry.  I mean, where I live there's no industry anymore.  It used to be booming, now all the steel's gone.  That's why pretty much everybody doesn't live in Philadelphia.  Um, there was work -- you know, in steel fabrication and you know, in Bethlehem and what not and then you have a -- in the city we had -- used to have a ton of factories, now there's none of that.  And factories are decent because they're unionized and those people don't make minimum wage, they're making money.  But, ah, I guess the union's sort of scared all the, ah, American companies out of the country.  I mean, except for the Teamsters -- 
R:  Yeah, well -- 
L:  -- they're the only ones that have been able to stay in this country and stay strong with, like, UPS and Trucking and Fedex and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  Because everything else has just gone.  I mean, my brother worked for Lucre[?] before he joined the military -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they laid off, like, two hundred thousand people.  He, um -- and Lucre Technology is one of the largest companies in America.  He was working for them fine.  He was a Teamster and they just -- they said -- you know, one day [LAUGH] it was just like this company was going under.
R:  Well, it's hard to get a job anywhere right now.  But, even so the -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you start minimum, it takes you forever to say, "Okay, I'm up to eleven, twelve an hour" which -- it's ridiculous.  It should start -- I think, to start around eight for starters. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even that's below what you need.
L:  Well, that -- that's actually -- that's more -- that's more what I'm seeing with at least profitable companies and companies with a lot of cash revenue like, um, like, I guess, um -- like, where I worked at a gas station, they started all the gas pumpers at seven dollars an hour which was pretty enticing for, like, all these college kids and high school kids like me who just decided, you know, seven dollars an hour, you can't beat that for, you know, our age.  It beats working at McDonalds.  But, then the problem is, you're right, they're -- it's like they tell us, you know, "You can get raises but, you know, it's fifteen cents a year" and it's just, like, it takes so long to get anywhere and I mean, you never know if you're going to get laid off.  So -- 
R:  I know.
L:  And -- 
R:  I know.
L:  -- then they have like -- I look at, like, the cost of houses where, ah, [COUGH] my mom lives and, ah, she, ah, she bought a house for, like, a [MN] I -- I think like a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and she had it appraised because she had to refinance the mortage -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they reappraised it two hundred and fifteen and that's like three years' later.
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  Well, yeah -- 
R:  It -- 
L:  -- but, well, the pro- -- the problem that is, is property values going up like that and unemployment is up, you know?  So, everything keeps getting expen- -- more expensive, but nobody's making any more money.  You know, people have to, like, I don't know, sell their soles to, like, [LAUGH] buy houses these days.  It's just un- -- it's unbelievable and -- 
R:  And what -- what the w- -- 
L:  -- and I mean, the cost of living is just so high.
R:  And what the wages people make they can't afford to send their kids to college, you know -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get a bet- -- to get better, you know?
L:  Yeah.  My sister, she's just graduated and my mom made a -- she showed me the, um -- their was this thing in their school paper, it was like where everybody's going to school and like everybody was going to community college and I mean, like, people we knew were, like, real smart kids, straight As, four point oh, going to community college 'cause their parents cannot afford to send them to a regular college.
R:  I believe it.  I believe it because of the -- the wages to, you know -- I mean, these wages would be fine with -- ah, back in the old days when a loaf of bread was a quarter.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly, yeah.
R:  But, the prices keep going up.  Packages keep getting smaller of what you purchase and but the minimum wage doesn't go up and it makes me laugh -- 
L:  And -- 
R:  -- with the cost of living they give you to, like, ten cents.
L:  Yeah, and then they -- then they -- 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- cut the, um, then they cut -- 
R:  Then the state -- they take the taxes out of that besides.
L:  Yeah, and then they cut all the taxes for the [pause] highest percentages and the people they leave out are people that make less than twenty eight thousand dollars a year and twenty eight thousand of dollars a year is, like, sixteen dollars an hour.  So, it's a lot more money than I make.
R:  [LAUGH] A lot more than us too and I -- I have kids.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- 
L:  Ah, it's rough.  It's rough.  Ah, I don't -- I don't see an end to it.  That's the biggest problem.  I mean, it's going to take a lot of things to end it.
R:  It makes a lot of people, when they get married, not want to have kids because they can't afford 'em.
L:  Yeah.  Well, um, my boss, when he got laid off he'd just bought a house and he'd just gotten married and he's my age and I --
