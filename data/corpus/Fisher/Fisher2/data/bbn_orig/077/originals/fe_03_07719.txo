L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  My name is Nicole.
L:  Hi.  My name is Ellen.
R:  Hi, Ellen.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Rochester, New York.
R:  Okay.  I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
L:  So, where it's cold?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Right now it's not.  But, yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  In the -- in the winter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're supposed to talk about, um --
R:  Life partners.
L:  -- life partners.
R:  Yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, I -- I'm married --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I've been married for, uh, twenty f- -- twenty four years next week.
R:  Congratulations.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Thanks.  What about you?
R:  Um, actually I'm single.  So, I haven't found that special someone yet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, I think that it's awesome for people to sustain a relationship for that amount of time --
L:  Thanks.
R:  -- like you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's hard to -- it doesn't seem like it's been twenty four years.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, I don't know.  We -- we met and were married within a year --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- which is pretty unusual.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I think that when -- we just realized we had the same [LIPSMACK], um, values --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I think that's pretty important.  We do come from different religions and that's been ...
R:  You do?
L:  Yep.  He's, uh, Catholic and I'm Protestant and that's -- that's been tough at times.
R:  Right.
L:  But the values are still there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and we've been able to -- we have three children and, um, raise the children with both churches and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, so I think that -- that as far as a life partner we're -- we're life partners and ...
R:  Right.  So and, of course, communication is the key as well.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Definitely.
R:  Right.
L:  That -- that helps a lot.  We have, um [LIPSMACK] -- with the three -- three kids it keeps us pretty busy --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if you're not communicating forget it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And, of course, the delivery of the communication is just as important.
L:  Mhm.
R:  How it comes out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yep.  This is true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I guess you consider your life partner your soul mate as well?
L:  Yes, I do.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  He's my -- he's my best friend --
R:  Awesome.
L:  -- and ...
R:  That's definitely awesome.
L:  Yes.  If I can't talk to him about things then I don't know who I could talk to.  [LAUGH]
R:  Then there's really a problem, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yep.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, it's great.
R:  Right.  Well, I mean, I think that -- I think that it's possible for a person to have more than one soul mate perhaps, um, I mean, I'm not sure if that's really the case or not.  But, I mean, I've met so many different people in this world and connected to them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so to speak.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, I don't know if there's like one specific life partner that, um, each person is meant to have if that makes sense at all.  I mean, it comes down to --
L:  Well, that's --
R:  -- probably ...
L:  -- that's probably why there's so many divorces in the world.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, you think you've found the life partner and then you find somebody else --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or somebody finds somebody else and, um, I've not had that experience.  But I -- I -- I'm sure --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that that would be the case.  I -- I like to think that -- that he is my life partner.  That we're together forever --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and beyond.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, with other people that probably isn't the case.
R:  Right.
L:  Maybe we're unusual.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are you both very independent people as well?
L:  Yeah, I think so.
R:  Mhm.  I think that helps a lot as well.
L:  I do worry about that though as we get into, um [LIPSMACK] [inaudible].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We're not -- we're not there yet.  But I think we're so independent, we do so many things separately that when we don't have the kids to hold us together what will happen.
R:  Mhm.  Right.  Um, also like what I mean by that is you don't necessarily have to rely on each other for everything everyday.
L:  Okay.
R:  You're able to kind of still live your own lives even though you're together so to speak --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that for both of you to be independent keeps you connected --
L:  That's -- yeah, that's true.
R:  -- because you're not -- if one person feels like the other person needs them to get by every day then there's a problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that's where a lot of divorces and -- and break ups occur is because of that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You lose your independence and your self --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if you have to rely on anybody else besides yourself then I think people really start to wonder about you.
L:  Yep, that can be very true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I hadn't thought about it that way really.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I can see where that would happen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  No.  We're ...
R:  Or like a lot of women when they -- of course when they're dating they would make themselves look pretty or whatever and then they start, you know, going out with someone or getting -- they get married and they kind of don't bother with their hair and make up and they kind of don't care about themselves after a while --
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  -- and they don't think that that's a factor, but I think it's a definite factor in that equation.
L:  Oh, I think it definitely is.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I remember when, um, I was twenty years old I got contacts and I remember the optician telling me that as soon as I was married that -- that it would be okay, I didn't have to wear my contacts anymore.
R:  Wow!
L:  Well, I -- I -- I still wear my contacts and [LAUGH] --
R:  Really?
L:  -- it's been like twenty seven years.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I don't know.  But I think that's what he meant.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, once you have -- you have, um [LIPSMACK], gotten the person that you are married to or whatever you don't need to bother anymore and that's ...
R:  Right.  People tend to get too comfortable.
L:  Yep.  That's true.
R:  Yep.  And there is this thing, you know, you can't get too comfortable.  You can't totally lose that -- that mode --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- anyway --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it -- it -- it definitely makes sense to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, even though I'm single I feel like I have, um -- oh, boy -- [LAUGH] I have gone through so many like lessons in life about relationships --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that when it comes time when I do meet that life partner I guess you'd call it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or they're calling it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that I think I'd be definitely prepared for that because, I mean, I -- I'm so aware of the trials and tribulations that you go through and the essence of communication that it's -- it's really the key, it really is --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and if you don't have the communication you don't really have much.
L:  No, that's true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's true.  Yeah.
R:  So, but I think it's great that you guys are both independent people and you can kinda do your own thing and -- and, of course, you have your kids also.  So, I mean, you have a lot going on.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  There's probably never a dull moment really.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, there's not.  [LAUGH]  That's for sure.
R:  Which is a good thing too.  I mean, I'm sure you would probably wish that you'd have a dull moment --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- now and then, but ...
L:  I do.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just -- sometimes I feel like I'm on a merry go round [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it just doesn't stop ever.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um -- but that's a good thing.  Yeah, I -- I like to be busy and, um, fortunately I only work part time.  If I worked full time I don't know how I'd fit it all in.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  And your husband works full time or ...?
L:  Mhm.  Yep.
R:  Okay.
L:  He works full time.  He's been at the same place for thirty years.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  That's awesome.
L:  It is.
R:  That's awesome.  Huh.
L:  Yes, especially this day and age with all of the -- the lay offs and everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you hear about all over the place.
R:  Yes.  Absolutely.
L:  So, yeah.
R:  [MN] Um, where did you guys meet?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, at a, um, play.  We were both in a -- a musical as a matter of fact.
R:  Oh, that's awesome.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was kinda neat.
R:  What a way to meet.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know it.
R:  I'm into theater and acting also.  So ...
L:  Are you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  We haven't done any since then.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's too funny.
L:  But we both sing.  We sing in different -- different groups.
R:  Wow!
L:  But we like to sing.  I sometimes wish we could sing in the same -- in the same group sometimes.
R:  Right.
L:  That'd be fun.
R:  Maybe eventually.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully.
R:  And that would help you, um, grow together in another aspect of your lives.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right, yeah, later on when we need to do that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.  But there's a reason for everything I totally believe.  So, probably for the time being you need to be around other people too --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to do that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, that makes sense, you know?
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It does.
R:  [LAUGH] Food for thought.
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]  That's a good thing.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.  And, I mean, I meet so many people every single day.  I'm -- I have two different jobs.  Actually I have three, but two kind of full time.
L:  Oh, two full time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that keeps you busy.
R:  Yeah.  I'm a server at a restaurant and I also do mortgages.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  You must meet a lot of interesting people.
R:  Um, yes [LAUGH], to say the least.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's great.
R:  Yeah.  And, I mean, I kind of look at people's personalities on a daily basis --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it just really makes me think -- I mean, going back to that conversation about, you know, soul mates and it's just -- you kind of -- kind of see through people I see --
L:  Mhm.  [MN]
R:  -- and you kind of have a feeling, like you just know how they are.  You don't even necessarily have to talk to them. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  You can kind of just look at people and know what their whole demeanor and candor is about and --
