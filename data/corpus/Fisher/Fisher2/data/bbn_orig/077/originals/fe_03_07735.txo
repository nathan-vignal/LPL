L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, I'm Gina.
R:  I'm Joyce.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Good meeting you.
L:  So, um, minimum wage.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Five fifteen an hour just doesn't seem enough.
L:  Uh, no way.  [LAUGH]  Um, I think personally that the people who make up these minimum wage things don't have to live in the real world.
R:  No, they don't have a clue.  They haven't been --
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they haven't been in the trenches.  They don't know.
L:  No.  I mean, five fifteen an hour you can't survive on your own.  That's [LAUGH] ...
R:  Well, you can't -- that's not even a decent second income anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't -- I don't get it, um, but then, you know, how -- how -- how high can it go?
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah.  Right now you're -- it's getting to the point with -- because of minimum wage workers you can't hardly afford to feed your family at McDonalds anymore, you know, 'cause their prices are going up.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, it's -- it's all -- it's ...
L:  But -- but then again you think about it like this, okay, what are the corporate bigwigs making?
R:  Well, that's where it needs to be cut.
L:  You know?  I mean, don't cut the minimum wage.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cut the bigwigs back.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  They're the ones pulling in a million dollars a year and stuff.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- it's just like with our schools, you know, the -- the administrators make all the money and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and the teachers get nothing.
L:  I know.  I think it's ridiculous.
R:  So ...
L:  But, I mean, they relegated minimum wage to like teenagers and not everyone has a huge education to go out and get those twenty five dollar an hour jobs.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I think there should be student wages --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- paid for student -- students --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, their first time job in training and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I -- I think that's fair to have student wages and I think years ago they used to.
L:  That sounds good.  That actually sounds very good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, who knows how it would fly but, you know ...?
L:  Yeah.  Well, see, but it -- it all comes down to, uh, the corporate people because, I mean, even, um, just recently one of the airlines was talking about how they had to, um, uh, cut all these jobs, yet at the same time secretly they were pushing, you know, uh, an idea for the corporate bigwigs to get a raise, you know?  So, they're gonna cut jobs and give themselves a raise and I really think that's what -- why, you know, they can't raise the minimum wage because the little franchise companies can't afford it because it doesn't trickle down.
R:  I agree.  I agree.  I think that's a big part of our problem is it's all the -- all the power is at the top --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there is no trickle down, um, they don't allow the -- I don't wanna say subordinates -- but the, uh ...
L:  Well, it's pretty much to them.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It is.  Um, I don't know whether it's a -- a power trip or -- or what.
L:  I think it is.  I really do.  I think it is.  And -- and when you think about how hard the minimum wage people work compared to, you know -- I mean, yeah, the corporate guys might put in seventy hours a week, uh, you know, sitting in an office.
R:  The little guys would do that --
L:  But the little guy does that ...
R:  -- but the little guys would do that too.
L:  Yeah.  And they take home pennies.
R:  Well, and not only are they minimum wage workers, but they're not allowed to work full time and receive any benefits.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  So ...
L:  That's the other thing.
R:  Yeah.  That's always a problem.
L:  You know?  Or what they'll do is they'll have them work just close enough that, uh, they're almost full time but not enough that they can get those benefits.
R:  Exactly.  And that -- that happens way more than -- than anybody would probably admit to.
L:  Oh, oh, all the time.
R:  And that's because it costs --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- the corporate level --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- too much money.
L:  You know, they don't wanna spend the money on the benefits, they don't wanna pay these, you know, poor people I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, and, yeah, we have the working poor and then -- and then we have all the immigrants that come over and --
L:  That's true too.
R:  -- and they're -- you know, they're happy to get those jobs, or used to be happy to get those jobs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, you know, it's -- I don't know -- it's -- it's -- it's difficult to -- to put into words because there's too much emotion there for it.
L:  There -- there is.  It's -- it's sad really.  I mean, I feel bad for, you know, the immigrant people who wanna come in, um, you know, to find a better life because really it is a better life compared to what they're coming from --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and you can't blame them because our ancestors did the exact same thing.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, we can- -- we can't really look down on them.  [LAUGH]
R:  But with -- with the influx of -- of the, um -- the people from Mexico especially --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I live in California --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and the influx of the people coming in from Mexico they're happy to get whatever they can and they're -- they don't have -- they don't have the -- I don't wanna say that they're not spoilt because they --
L:  I -- I know just what you mean.
R:  -- they're used to living in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in bad conditions --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and they accept --
L:  So, anything is better.
R:  -- they accept it.  You're right.  They accept, you know, um, secondary housing and everything else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's not until they've been here long enough to understand.
L:  That they start to realize.
R:  Yeah.  And then there's an uproar and then, you know, they -- they start to rebel.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, but ...
L:  You know, and who can blame them?  I mean ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, it's --
R:  But ...
L:  -- it's like free slavery.
R:  Well, pretty much.  Yeah.
L:  I, um -- I live in Pennsylvania, but I lived in North Carolina for a while and I remember the, uh, immigrant workers in the fields and the way they lived was just deplorable.  I mean, no one would've stood for that.  But they considered it, you know, great.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's better than what they had at home --
L:  You know?
R:  -- and they're still able to send money home.
L:  Right.
R:  They support themselves and they still spend -- or send probably more than half their pay home.
L:  Right.  And even on the little minimum wage --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or less because, uh, just a few years ago, um, minimum wage, uh -- I worked as a -- a waitress years and years ago and, um, minimum wage for a waitress was like two dollars and seventy cents [LAUGH] and I think how could you survive on that kinda money?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I -- I did the same thing.  I think it was a dollar seventy five --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and then I worked in a restaurant.  So, they took meals out daily.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, if you had a lunch break you had to have a meal and -- and whether you ate it or not --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you're dinged --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- you know, however much each day.
L:  Yep.  I mean, it's just not fair, you know?  I -- I really think that they take advantage of people who rely on minimum wage jobs, um, simply because they may not be quite as educated, um, not saying that they're -- they're, you know, not intelligent, but they just don't have the opportunities to see that this isn't right.  Do you know what I'm saying?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  They -- and it's not until they're here --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a longer period of time that they start to see how -- how the majority of Americans live and what's expected --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- and then -- and then they are looking for more.
L:  I know.  You know?  But it's sad.  Uh, I really do think they should try and raise it.  But I think it should be at the cost of, you know, the corporate ...
R:  Coming from the top.  Cut the top --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and bring it down.
L:  Cut the top.  Right.
R:  Bring it down to the ...  You know?
L:  Because, I mean, companies learn and have learned in the past that the happier your employers are -- I mean, your employees are the better they work.
R:  Exactly.
L:  If you pay them more, if you treat them better they work harder, they work better.
R:  That's right.
L:  They're happier.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  If you stiff 'em all the time that's -- you know, that's why they have to have security cameras up because people are always stealing from the till.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're -- you're really -- you -- you're right on there, um ...
L:  You know, it's -- it's a shame.  The companies that treat their employees good always seem to prosper and pay has a lot to do with that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, okay, start 'em out at minimum wage, but at least make it so that the raises come, you know, quickly not, you know, you have to wait a year and then you get a quarter.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean a year and a quarter that's, you know [SIGH] -- that's not even the cost of living raise.  Do you see what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah, I do.  And -- and you're right, um, there are -- but again, you know, to raise the minimum wage means that the cost of --
L:  I know.
R:  -- product --
L:  Right.
R:  -- goes up --
L:  Goes up.
R:  -- and, you know, if ...
L:  And of course then the rest of us pay for it.
R:  Exactly.  So, minimum wage really doesn't mean anything.
L:  No.
R:  When you raise minimum wage there's no gain for anybody --
L:  That's -- that's exactly right.
R:  -- especially the minimum wage worker because ...
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  Yeah.  You know?  So, it -- the -- the cut -- the cut needs to come at the top --
L:  Yes. 
R:  -- and benefit all the way down --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because it's ...
L:  I think that's the only way.  Unfortunately I really don't see that happening.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  No.  But --
L:  Those bigwigs are not going to take a cut.
R:  -- it -- it doesn't -- it won't do any good to raise -- I mean, not that it won't do any good -- the minimum wage worker will feel better about themselves that they're making more money, but it will -- it will be meaningless.
L:  Yeah, because everything else will raise right around it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  'Cause as soon as the minimum wage goes up then -- then the cost of everything else that they're -- they're going to be needing --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- will go up --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- to meet that need.
L:  You know, I -- I feel the same way.  It's really, um, like a catch twenty two.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I don't know.  Are we just accepting that it -- that it is or -- or are there solutions to the problem that ...?
L:  I think there's --
