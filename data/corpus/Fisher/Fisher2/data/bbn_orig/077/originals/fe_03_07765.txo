L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm in Indiana, my name is Sue.
R:  Uh, I'm in Florida, my name is Kirsten.
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I guess we're supposed to talk about the unemployment rate, or the --
R:  Um, minimum wage.
L:  Minimum wage, yes.  I was close. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it's kinda low.
R:  Uh, I didn't -- it -- it was [inaudible] -- I didn't even know what it was.
L:  I had no idea until she just said it was five dollars and fifteen --
R:  Fifteen.
L:  -- cents an hour.
R:  Yeah, I didn't know that either.  I, um, don't work for minimum wage. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't either.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So I had no idea, but I think if they're gonna try --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to get people off of [NOISE] welfare and whatever, if they can get 'em --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to work --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think five fifteen is a little low. [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  If --
R:  The problem is that a lot of these jobs that are at minimum wage, it might be okay except that if they have kids or a family or whatever, they can't get -- they don't have health insurance, I think that's the bigger issue.
L:  Right, I think so too.  That's, um, the health insurance is a big issue, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not a lot of places even offer if that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, that they get minimum wage.
R:  Yeah, I know.  I know that -- I mean, I know that it's important to us that we have -- that one of us has health insurance, I mean, I don't work but my -- my husband, um, he works and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's one of the important things, is that we have health insurance so that we're covered. [NOISE]
L:  Right.  That's -- my husband works also and I'm -- I'm a stay at home mom and I -- we couldn't do it without his insurance at work.
R:  You can't -- you really can't work, if you're a single parent and you're not covered by health insurance.
L:  Right.
R:  Because of your kids.  I think that kids get sick [NOISE] and kids get sick a lot.
L:  Right.  I have, um, a friend of mine that has a -- a son that right now she's not able to work and she still can't -- couldn't get any kind of help or coverage for him.
R:  Really?
L:  So it was [COUGH], excuse me, that she also needed health coverage too and even though, um, she wasn't working, she couldn't get anything for her son.
R:  Huh.
L:  And a lot of people that are working that, um, make six or seven dollars an hour even, have to pay their own insurance.
R:  Yes, yes, I know, I know.  And it's expensive.  It's very, very expensive to pay your own insurance.
L:  Yes.  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] my --
R:  So --
L:  -- sister just had to take out a -- a policy through her work because of her --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- husband got laid off.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's like, maybe three or four hundred dollars a month.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well I don't know ... I bet my husband pays that much because he has family cover. Before, when I was working, we each had our own health coverage, so we paid the single rate, but now that I was, um -- when we moved down here I went to school so I was paid to be in the research[?] [several inaudible words] benefits of any kind and, um, and I'm not even working now at all, I'm still finishing up my degree, and, um, [LIPSMACK] we had to have the family coverage to cover both of us, and I bet he pays bi weekly two hundred and fifty bucks to his health insurance.
L:  Wow.
R:  I'm not sure, I'm not sure.  I'm trying to remember.
L:  I think they take very little out of -- out of my husband's check, and, um, we only pay, um, a fifteen dollar co pay after we pay our deductible, which makes it good.  And it --
R:  Um, we don't have to pay a deductible.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, only if we use something out of network.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, it's not an HMO and the co pay -- the offices[?] at co pay is twenty dollars and the drugs for co pay, it's just changed and I'm trying to remember, there's two tiers of drug co pay, there's if you order a mail order you get -- you pay like, a fifteen dollar co pay for -- for each -- you pay like, thirty dollars for three months I think is what it ends up being, um, if you have recurring prescriptions.  And then if you get a generic I think it's fifteen dollars each prescription.  And then I think if you get a named drug [inaudible] it's up to twenty five or thirty.
L:  Wow.
R:  So I'm trying to remember.  Neither one of us takes any regular drugs though or regular prescriptions so it has never been an issue for me, the co pay with the drugs, because [SIGH] we use them for [inaudible].
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Um, we have a very small co pay on our [COUGH], excuse me, on our drugs because our son has [LIPSMACK] allergies.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it's -- w- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He was taking the Clarinex[?] and then when they put, um --
R:  And so it's non prescription.
L:  -- uh, Clarinet[?] -- Claridon's[?] what it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then when it went out on the market --
R:  Now you have to pay for it.
L:  Well, his doctor told us, he said, "Uh, when he runs out of this prescription let me know" he said, "And then instead of you having to pay fifteen dollars or whatever it is for like, ten pills" --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he says, "I'll switch him to Clarinex instead of Claridon".
R:  So that the insurance will still cover it.
L:  Right.  So that it would still be covered for him.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And when they take it off the -- the prices of that stuff just sky rocketed.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, but, no, no allergies here either, no, we're -- we're fortunate that way.  Very fortunate.  But, I don't know about minimum wage, I don't -- I don't know what to say about that.
L:  I didn't even know how much it was.  I had --
R:  No, I didn't either.
L:  I had no idea.
R:  I didn't either.  It's not something that is directly influenced on my life.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm just trying to think about what I have to say about minimum wage.
L:  Um --
R:  Other than I'm glad I don't work for it.  Of course, I don't know why I say that seeing as I don't work at all and I don't make any money.
L:  Right.
R:  The minimum wage would still be a vast improvement over whatever salary I'm bringing in now at zero.
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that feeling, been there. [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh [LAUGH] -- no, it's fun, it's not a big deal, um --
R:  Well this survey ranks right up with the one I did the other night on sports and football.
L:  I did that one!  Television sports.
R:  Ye- well, this one was, um, what do you think about any kind of sports and what do you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's just --
L:  And television, sports on television was the one I got.  It was last Friday I think.  Oh no, it was just two nights ago and, uh --
R:  That's what mine was.
L:  -- I talked to the woman and she said -- I said to her -- she introduced herself first and introduced myself and I said, "And I am a really big hockey fan".  She goes, "Good".  She says, "Because I'm not a fan of any sport of any --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- kind and I never watch it".
L:  Yeah, that -- the lady that I talked to was kinda like that and it was like, she says, "Well, I've seen hockey on TV" [LAUGH].
R:  We ended up -- actually it ended up being a really interesting and longer discussion and easier for the conversation to flow because she kept asking me questions about hockey and we ended up having a big long talk about hockey.
L:  Right.  This -- this gal that I -- did pretty much the same thing and that's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Some of the -- the subjects they have been trying to get a hold of me and it -- I can't find anything, it's on my Internet answering machine and on my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my regular answering machine and I -- I just now get, mm, getting through to 'em.  Now this is my third survey I think.
R:  This is my third also.  But, um, I have nothing to say about minimum wage.
L:  Well I know -- I w- got to thinking about that today and people were talking about someone -- someone had mentioned minimum wage, like, working at McDonald's and places --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like this and, um, they said, "Well, I'd never work there".  I said, "You know, minimum wage or not, how would you be w- eating there if nobody would work there for minimum wage?"
R:  Yeah, but it's one thing if the person who's working there is, um, retired supplementing their income, if they're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sixteen getting spending money, or if they're a single parent trying to support three kids.  I think that's the difference.
L:  Yeah, and it's -- it's one of those things where you can say -- can't say really that you would never do it because you don't know what's gonna happen.
R:  Oh, I was just gonna say, if you needed the money and they were gonna hire you, you would work there happily.
L:  That's right.
R:  For whatever they pay you.
L:  And I just -- I don't know, myself, I think, even not really knowing a whole lot about the minimum wage and the -- and the market for wages nowadays, um, I just think it seems kinda low if somebody's trying s- -- trying really hard to get off of any kind of government subsidized programs.
R:  You know what the other half of the equation is though?
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  If you set the minimum wage you start influencing the market and the market should have to pay whatever wage will be -- will -- will bear, that the market will bear.  So if workers won't work for the wages they're paying then they will have to pay more.
L:  Right.
R:  But I think a business owner should have some flexibility in determining what wage they wanna pay.  I don't know, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I'd -- that's -- I kinda feel the same way.  It's just, um, yeah! [LAUGH]  I forgot what I was gonna say.  I guess it was --
R:  And then when they hire people that are -- are crappy employees because they're the only people that work for the crappy wages that they'll pay them, their business will be run into the ground.
L:  Right.  And that's -- and it's getting to where a lotta people, even though they're minimum wage jobs, they're jobs, they will pay, uh, at least their gas to get back and forth and to put food on their table and that.  But around in these parts they say, "Well, there are no jobs, there's no jobs".  Well, I could go out today and get a job.
R:  I could've got one today, I was in a store and there was a big sign.  Lots of mall jobs, the mall's hiring.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, if you absolutely have to have a job -- but then there's another thing, I mean, you know like with me, I'm an engineer.  I mean, for me to go work in the mall, I can't be working full time to find a job as an engineer if I'm working in the mall.
L:  Right.
R:  And I would much prefer to work as an engineer, that's what I love to do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and that's what I study, I'm working on my -- my doctorate and when I get done I don't wanna, you know, go work at the mall.  But we've talked about me going to work at the mall while I'm looking for a job, so that I, uh --
L:  [NOISE] But it -- it's like --
R:  -- I get a g- --
L:  It'll be hard to really get used to those wages after, um --
R:  Yeah, but I -- I don't work at all though.
L:  Oh.
