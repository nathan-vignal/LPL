R:  Hi, I'm Louise.
L:  I'm Chrissie.
R:  Hi, Chrissie.
L:  How are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  Fine thanks.  And you?
L:  I'm doing good.
R:  Um, okay, what we consider to be the most important, uh, characteristics or something like that about a lifelong partner.  Do you wanna go first or ...?
L:  No.  Go ahead.  You can go first.
R:  Um, someone who's considerate and understanding.
L:  Right.  I'd have to agree with that, and honest and trustworthy.
R:  And mature.  I don't know if, uh, that's ...
L:  Nah.  Not really so much mature.  Ya gotta be a little [inaudible] I guess.
R:  Well, mature.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Men never seem to grow up.  A lotta them --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- a lotta them remain eternal little boys that's why I said that.
L:  Very true.  Hear ya there.  Well, let's see.  [LIPSMACK]  Someone that would -- actually remembers birthdays and anniversaries 'cause mine doesn't.
R:  Well, yes, considerate --
L:  Not at all.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- is part of it.  When you're -- when you're thoughtful --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, when you're -- gee, I usually have all the answers to this one.
L:  [LAUGH] Gotta have [SIGH] stuff to talk about.  Communication's very good.
R:  Oh, absolutely.
L:  That's a definite plus.
R:  Yes.
L:  Good with the kids.
R:  Yes.  Um, yes, that's true.  Well, I don't have children so, uh --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I didn't think of that one and even when the children are older I guess you have to be -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and when they're out of the house --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then it's the grandkids.
L:  Right.
R:  Um ...
L:  Good worker.  Good, hard worker.
R:  Well, this is gonna ...  Excuse me?
L:  I said a good, hard worker.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], yes, to be reliable, to be dependable, to -- to know how to share.
L:  Right.
R:  Communication is the big one, no question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], I think we're pretty much, uh ...  Let's see.  Thoughtful, considerate, um, uh, being able to share.  Well, we did name a lotta them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I'm sure after, uh, this conversation -- as soon as it's over I'll think of a few others.
L:  I hear ya.
R:  But, um -- and someone -- as you get older you change and hopefully --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- when I said mature that person changes as well.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I mean, not dramatic changes by no means, but that's part of the growing process.  Um [PAUSE], well, again, I guess that's it.  I have to ask you a question.  Did you put your social security number in to this thing?
L:  Yeah, I did.
R:  Oh.  I did not.  I should've realized that it was the University of Pennsylvania and, uh, a cousin of mine who also signed up said that she understands that if you did not that you don't get paid and this is my second call.
L:  Huh.  Can you email them?
R:  I don't know.  I have to see if I can find the site.  I was afraid to initially.
L:  Right.  I kinda thought about it too.
R:  Is this your first call?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- and I'm curious as to why they want men, but they pref- -- not prefer --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're looking for male --
L:  I -- I read that too.
R:  -- men -- male referrers -- referrals.  I know my first question probably could've been better handled by a man.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah.  Let's see.  I don't know.  Once you're actually faced with the question it's hard to answer it, you know?
R:  It is because I'm not a quick thinker unfortunately.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's a very good question.
L:  Right.
R:  It's a very important one and, uh -- but I guess to capsulize[?] -- would you like to do that?  [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what did you say, I'm sorry?
R:  Would you like to capsulize whatever it is we discussed?
L:  Well, let's see.  My idea of a good man -- someone who does dishes, laundry, picks up after themselves [LAUGH], knows where the garbage can is.
R:  Well, yeah, like no role playing.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Right.
R:  That, um -- yeah, the -- the -- just because you're the female and he's the male the role playing.  But I -- I think again that could fall under being considerate and thoughtful and understanding --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and communicative.
L:  See, my husband and I -- well, I should say my husband lacks in everything we just mentioned.  [LAUGH]
R:  I assumed as much.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, he is just --
R:  Well, I'm divorced --
L:  -- not right.
R:  -- and that's one of the reasons I'm divorced.
L:  Yeah, he's very -- very, uh -- needs help.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Definitely needs to be a good Dad.  [NOISE]  Hold on please.  Mm.  That's kinda hard.
R:  And you're obviously much younger than I am.  When you get older you could better understand a lot of what it is that you should've had.
L:  Right.  Oh, I -- I know what I should've -- I should be getting from what I've seen from my parents and I knew how I -- you know, I saw how good my Dad took care of my Mom.  So, it's just -- that's what I was raised into believing a man should be like and boy, did I miss out on that.  [LAUGH]  That is one thing.
R:  Yeah.  And -- and -- and with all the right things, you know, then there's that element, that important ingredient, respect --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that you respect each other.
L:  Right.
R:  But that comes only if you have [SIGH], you know, someone ...
L:  You need that trust.  Trust is a big --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- big thing.
R:  And it -- especially in the beginning.  I mean, trust obviously once you're married a long time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's either there or it isn't.  But while you're building it it's difficult.
L:  Right.  Yeah, 'cause we've been together for eleven years and I don't have a clue as to how we do it.  Don't have a clue.
R:  You're married eleven or you're together eleven?
L:  Together.  We've been married for four.  But it's -- it's not easy.
R:  [PAUSE] Well, as I said, I'm divorced.  I never remarried.  I don't think I ever will get remarried because all those things I want in a man I don't believe there is anyone who possesses that --
L:  Correct.
R:  -- and I know like I'm anti man.  I'm really not.  Oh, I -- romance.  I love -- I miss the romance.
L:  Yeah, that's one we missed, you and I both missed.
R:  Yes.  And that's an important ingredient as well.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, that, uh, the flame doesn't necessarily die or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean -- but that takes two to keep it going.
L:  Right.  That it does.
R:  Um, what's [SIGH] -- Diane -- no -- can't even -- I am so caught off guard.  Shirley Bassey is one of my favorite singers and my favorite is How Do You Keep the Music Playing?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that's the r- -- you know, and that says it all.
L:  Right.
R:  In a marriage how do you do that?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know, all that wonderful romance pre marriage and then it gets buried someplace --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, not lose yourself in someone else and whatever the words are it's just perfectly said.
L:  Right.
R:  So, whomever's listening from Fisher they should go play that song --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that's my ideal man [LAUGH] whomever she's singing about.
L:  That's works.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes you gotta go back -- like take a nice vacation or something to get that back.
R:  Oh, absolutely, especially when you have children.
L:  Right.
R:  It's hard once the children -- once -- I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, and observing my family and friends once children come into play they become the most important and the first, second, third and then everything else men feel like they're being left out -- when they feel like they're being left out.  But the vacation helps.
L:  Right.  Yeah, it does.  We just came back from one and it was very nice.
R:  Alone or with the children?
L:  With -- by ourselves.
R:  How long did you go for?
L:  We were gone for four days.  We were at a, um -- like a working ranch in Arizona.  So, everything was just done for you and it was nice.
R:  Did you -- were you able to communicate?  Were you surprised by anything while --
L:  We -- we were ...
R:  -- when you had this alone time?
L:  It -- it was relaxing.  We talked a little bit and, of course, the last night we were there we had a fight 'cause we just can't -- can't go without something stupid happening.  So, that's just how we are.  But it was a nice time.  It was a nice time.
R:  Well, I mean, there's hope.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, obviously if there was nothing left you wouldn't have even had -- I doubt you would've had a good time.
L:  Right.  Yeah, it was a great time.  Can't complain about a free vacation that's for sure.  But it was perfect.
R:  Free?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's nice.
L:  Yeah, it was free.
