L:  Hello?  I -- this --
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes, hi, this is Rena.
R:  Hi, this is Gene.
L:  Hi, Gene.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How are you?
R:  Uh, I'm good, thanks.  [NOISE]
L:  Good.
R:  How are you?
L:  Okay, so, um, we're just supposed to talk about the -- the topic of the day, huh?
R:  Ah, yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Life partners?
R:  It's, uh, just --
L:  Is that what they said?
R:  Yes.  [MN] [inaudible].
L:  And -- and what was the question?  What do you think is the most important thing?
R:  Wow, it's, uh, uh -- it's a -- a big, big topic, huh?
L:  Th- --
R:  Then I think it's, uh, the -- the -- the -- the -- the most +important thing I would look is shifting from time to time.  
L:  [NOISE] [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  [MN] Yeah, I'm sorry.  I -- I didn't hear you.  I just wanted to make sure I got the question right.  What was it?  What's the most important thing for -- in a life partner?  Is that what -- what -- what the question was?
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  Oh, okay.  I just wanted to make sure 'cause the T- -- my husband had the TV on.  That's an important thing for a life partner.  For them to cooperate.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Right?  Okay.
R:  [MN] Huh.
L:  S- so we're supposed to talk about, uh, what's important for a life partner.  I think that --
R:  So, I think -- I think, uh, we should talk what you -- or what are you looking for in your husband and what I'm looking for in my wife.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You wanna go first?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh ...
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [MN] ...
L:  I think, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- companionship --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and I think, uh, what I'm looking for now is definitely different from what I'm looking for five years ago.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Tell me about that.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Y- --
R:  Ah --
L:  What do you mean?
R:  Well, er --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now I'm looking for, er --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- why, why, why, it's difficult to share it.  How -- how about you first?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay, I just wanted to know what?  I was just curious what you meant by that.  Because that makes a lot -- I think it makes a big difference as far as age.  We're -- we're in our thirties and right now I guess, um, [LIPSMACK] what I'm looking for in my life partner is, um, probably s- uh, to set some goals.  We have a lot of things that we wanna accomplish, you know, and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we -- to, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess, kind of, be on the same wavelength as far as what goals we want in our life and -- and you don't always have to agree on things but I get frustrated sometimes because, um, I'm more of a, you know -- a pusher --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and a m- m- m- -- I guess, a little bit more motivated.  He's a little more laid back.  [LAUGH] So, I guess one important thing for a life partner is that you are able to [LIPSMACK] communicate what you each want and then try to meet your goals together.  So, like we're looking for a house.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  And I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what's important is that, uh, you know, we're on the same, I guess, wavelength as far as, you know, where we wanna live and the kind of house and, um, uh, that's really important.  See, when you're dating then what's important is, you know, that they're good looking and that they're fun to hang out with, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] That -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is that what you meant by what's important now is different than five years ago.
R:  Uh, yes --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think so.  Yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because now I'm, uh, more clear what -- what I am and more clear what my wife is.
L:  How long you married?
R:  Eight years.
L:  Eight years.  Okay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so you're not married that long.  But it's [MN] --
R:  Not that long.  It's -- it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- long enough to know a person, I think.  
L:  Is it your first marriage?
R:  Yes.
L:  And you have kids?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, [MN] do you have two kids or ...?  How many kids do you have?
R:  Ah, one.  I have a --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- daughter.
L:  Oh, okay.  So that's important as far as [MN] parenting, right?  What -- what, uh, is important with a life partner as far as parenting?  Because we're not parents yet.
R:  Oh, mhm, yeah.
L:  What's it --
R:  I don't actu- er, [LIPSMACK] -- but we don't have much, er, difference on how to parenting but we have s- some difference, um, er, how to, mm -- how to, er, er, look at the life itself.  You know, I -- I -- I'm a person that's, em, easily satisfied but I keep, uh, uh, advance myself.
L:  Advance --
R:  I'm a person, uh, easily satisfied, uh, with, uh, what I have but I'm also, er, not, er, er -- I'm also, er [NOISE] -- well, er, it's -- I'm satisfied with what I have and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- keep, uh -- I keep, uh, working.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  And, er -- but --
L:  -- and -- a- --
R:  And my wife is always not satisfied.
L:  Ah, that's a woman thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  We always want more?  Is that what you mean?  She always wants more?
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  Or she's unhappy with what she has?  Or she just always wants more?
R:  She always wants more and she --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- she's not h- -- she's always not happy.
L:  Ah.
R:  And she always looking for s- someone better than her.
L:  Oh.  Looking for -- oh, you're meaning that she thinks other people have qualities --
R:  No, not -- nothing, no, no.  Not -- she always, uh -- n- no, not for other people.  Look for s- something else.  She always wants more money or more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pleasure.
L:  Mm.
R:  More --
L:  Me too.  What is -- it must be a woman thing, huh?
R:  Well, this --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- may not be a -- a -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- related to gender but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just to her personality.  I think some males who want more money, more power.
L:  So, does that, uh, create any kind of like, uh, problems [MN] between -- 
R:  Yes.
L:  -- in your --
R:  So --
L:  -- relationship, I guess?
R:  Well --
L:  'Cause I'm like that.  My husband and I are like that.  I always want more.  I always want more.  And he's always satisfied, you know, with like basics and I always want more, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so, er, I -- I'm al -- sometimes I'll feel re- er -- feel like, um, she's always pushing me.  And I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- don't like that.
L:  Uh-huh.  You know what?  You have the same kind of marriage we do.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm always pushing him.  But you know what?  I try to understand the type of person he is and, you know, like I said.  We're only married two years so before we got married, we kinda knew, you know.  We didn't live together before we got married.  I tried to do it the traditional way.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  Nowadays everybody lives together but, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- w- he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of knew the kind of person I was and I knew the kind of person he was and I think maybe that's what attracted us to each other.  So --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as the question about what's important in a life partner is to accept one another for who they are.  But instead of maybe putting the other partner down for who they are, try to relate to them maybe and try to meet in the middle.  You know, we're always trying to like, kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I always try to get him to understand me.  He doesn't always understand me [LAUGH] and I try to understand him and then we try to [LIPSMACK] m- we make a lot of compromises 'cause we got married by a priest and a rabbi and they both said about marriage is all about compromise.  You -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you think?
R:  Er, yes.
L:  [LIPSMACK] That's important in a life partner is to accept the person for who they are but also try to, I think, help each other grow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the relation- -- and help the relationship grow which is usually what the woman --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think has to do.  Right?  Does the woman usually -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- y- you think?  I know I'm going back to the gender thing but [LAUGH] I don't know, uh ...
R:  Yeah, I don't think it -- it's a gender thing but it's just some kind of personality.  Just habit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to, er, you and my -- my wife has this -- this kind of --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- personality.
L:  Yeah, it's -- I -- I think that --
R:  And, uh, yeah, and -- and that's, er -- I think it's a philosophy.  It's how you see this world.  Er, you can --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- do the same thing but you can feel differently if you [MN] look at it from --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a different point of view.
L:  Are you a philosopher?
R:  [MN] N- no, I'm not a philosopher --
L:  What are --
R:  -- but I like to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- view from several point.
L:  That -- that's a good observation.  It's very true.  Two people could be experiencing the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- same relationship and one could be happy and one unhappy.  You know?  Or one satisfied, one not or -- you know?
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  That's very true.
R:  And yeah -- y- yeah, somewhere if you are not married, er, and s- you [NOISE] -- yeah, before you -- before you're married, you should appreciate your, er, single life.
L:  [LAUGH] I had a lot of [inaudible] --
R:  Af- after you're married, you should appreciate a marriage life.
L:  Ah, that's good.
R:  But you can see it another way.  Before you married y- you -- you -- you can just w- er, um, don't like -- like s- uh, single life but want a marriage life [MN] [MN] [MN] badly.
L:  Wants a l- married life --
R:  But af- --
L:  Did you say, "better"?
R:  -- af- after marriage you -- you go back to you want your single life badly.
L:  [LAUGH] We -- people -- human beings are never satisfied, right?  They're -- the grass is always greener on the other side.  Is that what you're saying?
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  Well, I had a lot of years of single life and, you know, [MN] [MN] I made the best of it.  I got a career, I went to school, I went back to graduate school and I did my thing and, you know.  I waited until I found s- somebody.  A life -- somebody I could share my life with, quote life partner type thing, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, I mean I waited [MN] and you're right.  I think that if everybody could appreciate when they're single, they could appreciate their single life but then when you're married, appreciate that.  My husband and I were just talking about that.  Sometimes I don't feel -- I mean, I -- I'm a doer and I'm a giver, you know?  But I also like to receive or at least be appreciated and, um, [LIPSMACK] I think that life partners need to, like you said, appreciate what you have and do n- kind things to one another to keep the good --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- spirit and feeling in, um, the relationship.  You think?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
