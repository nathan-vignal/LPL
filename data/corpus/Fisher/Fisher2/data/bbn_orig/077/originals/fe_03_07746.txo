L:  Latoya.
R:  Shelley.  [PAUSE]  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  So, we're talking about minimum wage.
R:  [LAUGH] I guess so.
L:  Okay.  Um, uh, well, I don't think five fifteen is sufficient enough for people these days.  The cost of living is too expensive.
R:  I agree with you.  Um ...
L:  Is there anything in particular, like, I mean, you know, is there like -- well, it's, you know -- it's all just about minimum wage is what I'm saying.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  How is the flow of the conversation supposed to go?
R:  Uh, this is my first time doing this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mine too.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  Well, huh, I don't think that, like I said, five fifteen is sufficient enough for anybody to live off.
R:  I agree.  Oh ...
L:  That's the thing I've kids.
R:  Right.  Well, what state do you live in?
L:  I'm in Illinois.
R:  Oh, I'm in New Jersey.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  So, I know the cost of living is higher in New Jersey.
R:  Right.  Car insurance alone will kill ya.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And I'm in Chicago, so ...
R:  Okay.  Well, that's still expensive there too.
L:  Very.  Yep.
R:  But, uh, I -- I don't know if you have to talk about minimum wage the whole time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I -- I thought they said the topic of the day was minimum wage.  I'm not sure.
R:  Yeah.  For ten minutes.  I mean, how are ya ...?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh ...
L:  Okay.  Well, I mean, five fifteen I think is, uh, uh -- someone that's maybe just in high school or something.
R:  I agree.  Yeah.
L:  Probably someone -- for a summer -- a summer job or something.
R:  Or something part time.
L:  Yeah, part time.
R:  But for ...
L:  For a child though, someone with no children, no responsibilities, no car, no -- no apartment --
R:  Right.
L:  -- anything like that.
R:  As I said, five fifteen out there is nothing.
L:  Right.  So, like eighty hours a week at five fifteen probably is about, what, maybe five hundred dollars?  Probably not even that much.
R:  And the taxes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  Um [MN], well ...
L:  And we gotta talk for ten minutes.
R:  I know.  This is crazy.  Um ...
L:  What else about minimum wage?
R:  Well, right now I don't work.  I don't know what you do.
L:  Huh.  Uh, well, I work, um, in accounting.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I ...
L:  I ...
R:  Go ahead.
L:  If I had -- I guess if I -- you know, if I was in a position where I really, you know, needed it or something I guess five fifteen would be okay, you know, just for an entry level or something just so I can get my feet wet, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Just so I have some kinda income coming in.
R:  Right.  Um ...
L:  So, what type of job did you have before you got unemployed?
R:  I was a correction officer.
L:  Huh?
R:  I was a state correction officer.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I left 'cause I had a baby.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, my husband's a police officer.
L:  Oh, okay.  Congratulations on your baby.
R:  Thank you.  So, I -- I don't know if you've ever heard of Camden.
L:  Uh, Camden, New Jersey?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I've heard of it.  I -- I actually travel to New Jersey a lot.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's where my husband's a police officer from.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I mean, even there -- I mean, that's one of the poorest cities in the country.  Minimum wage doesn't cut it there.
L:  Right.  Minimum wage probably wouldn't cut it for, uh, the prisoners.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They get paid for working.
R:  Yeah, they get paid more than that.  [LAUGH]
L:  What about the thing?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, hell, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But, well, in -- in the prison I worked in they had a meat processing plant --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [NOISE] and, uh, they process all the -- the meat for all the state prisons.  Oh, my phone is horrible.
L:  Is it?  Oh, you're on a cell phone too?
R:  No, I'm on a regular phone.  But, uh, it's really raining here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I can tell you're on a cell phone.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I'm on a cell phone.  So, it's like -- you said this is your first time doing it as well?
R:  Right.
L:  So [MN], I thought it was like more than two people on a call.  Well, I guess not, huh?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How did you find out about this?
L:  Uh, on Volition.
R:  Oh, okay.  Uh, a friend of mine told me about it.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I'm just trying to get into the mystery shopping thing and get paid to do everything type of stuff.
R:  Yeah.  I've been doing that too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's -- it's pretty neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You even get paid more than five fifteen an hour for that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  And that's for like maybe five and ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  So, I mean, you can't complain, but ...
L:  Right.  [MN]
R:  I guess ...
L:  Well, five fifteen an hour you would have to be living at home with your parents [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.  That's ... 
L:  -- basically.
R:  Yeah.  No -- no bills, no nothing.
L:  I think that they have enough money to make, um, minimum wage more than five fifteen.  They can afford it.
R:  You know, in New Jersey [several inaudible words] have a different rate because isn't the minimum wage just a federal ...?
L:  Um, no, I think -- I think it's all the same.
R:  'Cause I know in New Jersey they normally hire at like six fifty.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  'Cause I know right now in Chicago it's I think maybe five dollars.
R:  [NOISE] That's gotta be hard out there too living in a big city --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause big cities are more expensive.
L:  Right.  Right.  And then like to rent an apartment or a studio nowadays is around like six and seven hundred dollars an hour -- I mean, not an hour.  [LAUGH]  A month.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's -- that's a lot for a studio.
L:  Right.
R:  But ...
L:  Yep.  So ...
R:  I guess nine more minutes to go.
L:  Nine more?
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  I thought we got about two minutes.
R:  Oh, that's not too bad.
L:  Huh?
R:  [NOISE] That's not too bad.
L:  No, not too bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm trying to find a spot where -- there we go.
L:  Did you have to put in a pin number?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, okay.  Me either.  So, when we hang -- when we get ready to hang up when the ten minutes are up they prompt us and let us know where we can leave our comments?
R:  I guess.
L:  Okay.
R:  I hope.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Actually it came up on my thing, University of Pennsylvania.
L:  [MN] Right.  They said it was gonna be a one eight hundred number, but a two one five area code came up on my mine.
R:  Yeah.  It's silly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you -- did they catch you at work?
L:  Uh, no, actually I just left work.  I'm on my cell phone right now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Stuck in rush hour traffic?
L:  Uh, no, we just actually, uh, pulled up to where I was going to.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yep.  So [MN], had your friend, um -- the -- your friends do this all the time?
R:  Yeah, they do all kinds of stuff like this --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the mystery shopping and getting paid for the phone call surveys and all that.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I figured I'd try it out and see -- see what's what.
L:  [LAUGH] So, have you tried the mystery shopping yet?
R:  I did a couple of 'em so far.
L:  Did you like it?
R:  Well, I -- I went to restaurants --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and, uh, yeah, they -- ended up taking my son, which he's -- he's two now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That was a mess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Me -- me and my husband we took him and woo, they kicked us out.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] They kicked you out?
R:  No, but they -- they threw [inaudible].
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it's -- it's fun though.  But do you use Best Mark?
L:  Uh, I use -- wait, I, uh [LIPSMACK], service [inaudible] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, uh -- it's actually -- I signed up with a few.
R:  Try Best Mark.
L:  Uh-huh.  Is it Best Mark dot com?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, they -- they do a lotta restaurants --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, they reimbur- -- they tell you how much money you can spend and they reimburse you up -- and they reimburse you fast.
L:  Okay.  Oh, okay.
R:  So, all you have to do is go and fax the stuff from home and in about three weeks you have your money back.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they're -- they're pretty good.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]  Huh, so how many more minutes have we got?
R:  I don't know.
L:  It's ten minutes now.
R:  Well, hopefully they'll come on.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  So, I guess with the last comment [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's -- I guess talk about, um, minimum wage.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh ...
R:  Not enough.  It should be at least eight dollars.
L:  Right.  I think -- right and I think they do have enough for it.  They've got the money to go over and fight and stuff like that.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Take their money and give it to the people that, you know, voted for you and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  They need it.
R:  We should worry about this country first.
L:  Not saying they don't need it.  Yeah.
R:  Take care of our own.  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Come on.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words] and they're all running around.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, they caught me at a pretty wild time.
L:  Right.  I didn't expect, um, to be called so soon because I just signed up yesterday.
R:  Oh, wow!  I signed up like last week.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, God, you're getting what ten dollars a phone call.  That's more than minimum wage for ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  For ten minutes.  Right.  Let me see.  Okay.  Eleven minutes thirty three seconds.
R:  I guess we're just --
