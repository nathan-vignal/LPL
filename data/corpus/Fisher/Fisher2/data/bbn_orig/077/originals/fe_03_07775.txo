L:  Hi, my name's Shaun.
R:  Hi, my name is Elise.  Where you calling from?
L:  Uh, I'm in Virginia.
R:  Oh.
L:  [SIGH] Actually.  [SIGH] Where you at?
R:  New York City.
L:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH] Um, comedy, drawing the line.  See, that -- [MN] for me, I don't.  I mean, I know that there is humor that it's in -- that is in bad taste.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] But if it's -- if it's really done in the spirit of humor [SIGH] then it's still humor.  It's not [MN] -- you know, it -- it's not malicious, it's not mean.
R:  Well, let me ask you something.  
L:  Okay.
R:  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if humor is insensitive to certain groups of people, you know --
L:  Mhm [MN].
R:  -- um, do you still consider that in good taste?
L:  [SIGH] Um, well, it's not --
R:  I mean, for instance, I'll be more specific.  Say, you know, a comedian --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, is doing an act, and he [SIGH], you know, makes jokes about disabled people.
L:  Mhm [SIGH].
R:  And, you know, they're funny -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but would you consider --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- see, I would consider that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in poor taste, because, you know, you're picking on a group, and, uh, who would feel badly about these jokes.  And non disabled people, you know, could [SIGH] -- you know m- -- for most part, may laugh at them.  But the people that are the butt of the jokes, who really have disabilities, you know, they could be, like, hard of hearing, you know, various --
L:  [SIGH] Well, how -- I mean, how different --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than, say, uh, Polish jokes or Jewish jokes --
R:  Well --
L:  -- or Catholic jokes --
R:  -- well, that --
L:  -- or, you know, you take -- you take any --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, you take any given [SIGH] -- this might be offensive to this group --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, yeah, it might be in bad taste, but if it's not -- if it's not [MN] -- I guess it's all in [LIPSMACK] why they're telling the joke, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I- i- is it -- is it because it's something that is funny, [SIGH] or is it because they're mean spirited?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] You know, if I -- if I tell --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] if I told a -- a, you know, just a simple joke of, you know, what do you call a paraplegic in a pool?  Bob.  
R:  Yeah, you see --
L:  [SIGH] You know, it's not to be mean, it's just --
R:  Yeah, but to me, that's not funny, you know?
L:  Uh-huh [NOISE].  
R:  I -- I'm not disabled, but it's -- I don't know.  You're saying --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in other words, you're saying --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- comedy is comedy no matter [SIGH] who's the butt of the joke, and no matter what group is, you know, singled out, you know, as a joke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I just think, you know, bec- -- I'll tell you the reason.  I think [SIGH], you know, we're living in very, you know, stressful times and very sensitive times, and, um, you know, people are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sort of offended at the least --
L:  [MN] Yeah, I think --
R:  -- you know, the least things.
L:  -- that's part of the reason why we need the humor.
R:  I know, but --
L:  Is to just --
R:  -- [MN] yeah, but --
L:  You know?
R:  -- when it gets, like you say, mean spirited, I mean --
L:  Right.  No, yeah, absolutely.  If it -- if it's [MN] --
R:  -- but --
L:  If it's done [SIGH] very intentionally to put down a specific group or just [SIGH] a specific person even, [SIGH] I think that's in [SIGH] -- I think that -- that -- that -- that's not humorous [NOISE].  I --
R:  Yeah, but you see, when people are -- are -- you know, to give you an example, there was a play which is a parody of a Tennessee Williams play.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] And, uh, one of the --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  -- characters in the play was hard of hearing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, you know, they kept going closer and saying, you know, "Do you hear it?", you know, they started yelling at, you know, him, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to make the point [SIGH].  And the audience, for the most part, was laughing, you know, 'cause it was funny, you know? 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because he was trying to get this hard of hearing person to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I hear a baby in the background [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, to -- to, you know, hear him, and most of the audience was laughing.  Now, [SIGH] I -- I heard later on from somebody there was somebody in the audience watching it who was hard of hearing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- who wore a hearing aid, [SIGH] and she found it offensive, you see?
L:  Mhm [NOISE].
R:  Because, you know, even though, you know, it was -- it wasn't intentionally ma- -- mean spirited --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know what I mean? 
L:  Yeah.
R:  People [SIGH] feel offended generally, I think, so --
L:  [MN] Yeah, I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think people should get over it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I've -- I'm very Polish and [SIGH] at one point I was very Catholic [SIGH], uh --
R:  Now, if somebody you --
L:  -- and --
R:  Yeah, go ahead.
L:  -- I've, you know -- Polish jokes -- how does a Polack take a shower?  He spits in the wind.
R:  [MN]
L:  Or -- or the -- the slightly more off color version of that, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, now -- but let me jus- --
L:  And --
R:  So, you -- so, you don't care?  
L:  No.
R:  You know, you don't feel -- you feel it's funny, and ...?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, humor for humor's sake --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- should be accepted as such [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Um [SIGH] --
R:  And what about political humor?  Now there's some Muslims doing polit- -- you think that -- that's funny too?  About hijacking and all of that?
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] Whether or not I find it funny --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, is -- is completely subjective.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it's a matter of personal taste.  Well, [SIGH] you know, I don't think that some [MN], you know [SIGH] -- there -- there -- there's a lot of things that I believe are comedy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and are funny that I don't necessarily find funny.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  And what kind of things are those?
L:  Uh, suppose slapstick.  You know --
R:  Really?  You don't find --
L:  -- just -- just plain --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, yeah, slapstick ke- -- comedy, I think it's [SIGH] fantastic [NOISE] as an art form, but it's not something I appreciate [SIGH].  You know, kind of like --
R:  Like --
L:  -- any other art form [SIGH].
R:  Like silent film slapstick or slapstick comedians?
L:  [SIGH] It -- well, like silent film slapstick.  Like the Keystone Cops --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and stuff like that.
R:  See, a lot of people think it's funny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know [MN]?
L:   Yeah, I -- I -- I get it, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't find it funny really.
R:  Yeah.  I guess --
L:  You know --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- I don't find it offensive either.  [SIGH] Although, you know -- there's a lot of things that [SIGH] e- e- -- what I find most offensive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is there's a lot of things [SIGH] that people in this country used to find really humorous.
R:  Like what?
L:  The, uh, [MN] there's some old Bugs Bunny stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for example, [MN] that you couldn't do nowadays because of all the politically correct and, "Oh, we have to be careful we're not offending anybody".  I'm like, it's just to be funny, then it shouldn't offend people.  People should understand it's just to be funny [SIGH].
R:  I know, but you see --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the thing is, now [MN] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- because of the times, politically, you know, correct and -- and all of that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is -- is the norm.  And [SIGH] people [MN], you know, have to -- I know stand up comedy people have to be [LIPSMACK] a little cautious too.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I mean, [SIGH] um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, because it's --
L:  I mean, it -- it's okay --
R:  -- just that -- yeah --
L:  -- you see, i- i- in today's society, it's okay for a black man to make fun of black people.  It's not okay for a white man to make fun of black people [SIGH].  It's okay for an Irish person to make fun of Irish people.  [SIGH] It's not okay for [SIGH] a British person to make fun of Irish people.  
R:  Right, because --
L:  You know?
R:  -- we're living in these kinds of times, yeah.
L:  And it's like, but what's the real difference?
R:  Well, because there's so much -- I'll tell you the difference.
L:  [MN]
R:  There's so much hatred in this world and so much bigotry --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that some of these jokes really foster --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the stereotypes and foster people -- in other words, suppose a man comes out and says --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- something about women and rape and making a joke of it, [SIGH] well, people might laugh.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It's a serious crime, and a lot of women --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so -- so that's why I think people [MN], you know, I -- I -- I mean, I -- I -- you have to draw the line --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- between comedy and, you know, um [MN] jokes that could be --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mean spirited, also foster stereotypes and more hatred.  Because [SIGH] we're living in a world, you know, as you know.  I mean, you're in Virginia and I'm in New York City --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where, you know, there's hate crimes or, you know [MN], against ethnic people, against diff- -- you know?  And there's all kinds of, um, violence and, you know, a lot of the jokes and a lot of the [SIGH], you know, violence, are against minorities and people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN], you know, who are different in -- in di- -- in many ways.  You know, religiously, sexually, ethnically, and, um [LIPSMACK], it just, you know, it -- it just feeds in to people's hatred.  And, you know, and sets people off the wrong way.  I know women are sensitive about [SIGH] male comics coming on and -- and, you know, and talking about date rape and things like that when -- when it's a reality --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  It's not funny, and -- no, I understand what you're saying, but I guess what I'm getting is humor is -- it's like a personal thing.  What's -- you know, what you say -- you know, it's good for you.  A lotta people find [SIGH] the slapstick very funny --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it doesn't mean they're wrong and it doesn't mean you're wrong.  It's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- your opinion.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, it's just -- it's just --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- your opinion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  And maybe somebody else, somebody else who's Polish might be offended by the jokes that you're not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  It depends how sensitive and how -- like, you know, what people, you know, are into.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  But I guess it's really an individual thing, that you really can't say collectively, you know, this is funny, this should be [SIGH] -- you know?  But everybody's entitled to their own opinion, and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I know that I don't like to hear jokes that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, offend different groups of people.  Because, you know, they have, um, [LIPSMACK], they have these joke books, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- these -- tonnes of books of --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and humor --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the humor section, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, some of them are -- are -- are really, like --
