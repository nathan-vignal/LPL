L:  Hello?
R:  Hi, I'm Molly from Ohio.
L:  How you doing?  I'm Mark from New York.
R:  Hello.
L:  How you doing [SIGH]?
R:  Good.  Um, they said they just raised it to five fifteen?
L:  Um, or if -- or to discuss if [MN] -- if raising it to five fifteen or whatever, five fifteen was acceptable.
R:  Oh, I think it's very unacceptable.
L:  Oh, I would have to agree.  
R:  Especially, um, from New York, huh?  Because --
L:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- uh, yeah, like my friend lives there and she gets, like, ten an hour and she's struggling in -- you know, and she has a good deal [LIPSMACK] on a place, and, uh, yeah, I have three jobs right now.  They're all above minimum wage and I'm --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] struggling, so ...
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  -- it's just --
L:  -- if you had to get an apartment, unless you're gonna live like in a -- a low income housing type apartment, even then it's probably, like six hundred [NOISE] [inaudible] minimum wage gonna really do it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  In New York.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, five -- five dollars an hour you're not gonna do anything, you know?
R:  Uh-uh. [LIPSMACK] No, that's really much at all -- that's really, really not much at all.  'Cause, like, in my neighbourhood, um, [LIPSMACK] nobody has jobs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so -- so everybody, uh, just seriously causes trouble all day long.  And I'm thinking -- and I -- I was like, "People, shut up, I have to get up in the morning and go to work.  I mean --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- get a job".  But then I'm just thinking, like, um, "Okay, why?"  Do you know what I mean?  It's like [NOISE] what are they supposed to do, put some french fries in oil for exactly five fifteen an hour?  That's so -- like, no wonder they'd rather be out causing trouble.  I don't know, it just -- it just really bothers me, and I was just thinking -- thinking that today --
L:  Oh, I -- I would definitely --
R:  -- so ...
L:  -- I mean, I got a couple of my friends who are laid off right now, and if they were to work for minimum wage, their unemployment is four hundred a, you know, a week -- you get, like -- New York is unemployment I think three eighty or f- -- somewhere between ei- -- three eighty and four twenty five a week.  And then, you know, it's after -- technically it's not taxed.  So, if they were to go work forty hours a week at minimum wage, they're still not gonna take home -- they're gonna take home forty -- two hundred dollars a week.  So, it doesn't pay for them to even go work on a mini- minimum wage job, because [SIGH] if you go work a minimum wage job then you gotta come off of unemployment.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it makes [MN] --
R:  That is so messed up, that is so stupid.
L:  -- it ma- [LAUGH] -- it makes no sense, you know?  You gotta find, like, off the book, you know, cash jobs.
R:  Yeah.  I was just -- that's -- [MN] just I guess, waiting, um, [LIPSMACK] for you to get on the phone, and I was just thinking about the best -- last summer -- the best job I ever had, seriously, was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- eight dollars an hour under the table.
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  And I'm like, that's so sad.  I have my degree, and it's like, "Aw, poor -- poor Molly", you know?  I just -- I -- that's really sad.  But I mean, I do live in, you know, a pla- -- [MN] not a -- a high -- a high, uh, you know, standard of liv- -- not, well, not standard of living.  What's the word?  Cost of living, I guess.  
L:  Cost of living, yeah.
R:  Um, yeah, stuff's pretty cheap out here.  Like, I pay one -- one eighty for my rent.
L:  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Uh-huh.  That's a big difference [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, exactly.  So -- but, yeah, so [MN] --
L:  I mean -- av- average of my friends' rent, and we're talking about small one bedrooms, and they're not even like in great, you know, not like the best areas to live.  Just, you know, average, middle --
R:  Normal, just --
L:  -- kind of middle class, right.  And you're talking nine hundred for one bedroom.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like, everyone makes -- you know, if you're, like, in New York, if you're making, like, forty thousand dollars, you're getting by.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's an amaz- -- it's an amazing thing, you're just getting by.  And, yeah, you know, it's, like, forty thousand dollars is actually pretty decent money and it's like you're just getting by.  It's pretty wild, you know?
R:  That is so weird, because that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- seriously is like my dream, you know, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- "Forty thousand dollars, oh my God", it's equal to, like, forty million as far as I'm concerned [SIGH], but, um --
L:  Right, and here the bills are so much more expensive.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know?
R:  Like, that is just crazy.  Because actually, I live in a huge beautiful apartment that was, like, built, [SIGH] like, in the thirties and it's awesome.  And my room is seriously as big as like a fricking, like, Olympic size pool.  It's awesome.
L:  Right. 
R:  But it's totally in the 'hood, you know what I mean?  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I pay -- that's why my rent is so cheap.  And I -- you know, I should of probably thought that -- figured that out when I moved in, huh?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, I'm learning now, now with the nice weather is, you know, all the freaks come out.
L:  Right, right, right. [LAUGH]
R:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah.  So, I don't know.  I -- I -- I -- there was all this stuff, like, when, you know, Ralph Nader was up, all this, um, living wage --
L:  Right.
R:  -- st- stuff.  And like, I couldn't really believe that that was even an issue.  I mean, how would they expect you not to either be a hustler slash have a real job?  [COUGH] How can you make it really, for real?
L:  I mean, like, to put it in perspective, like, the one eighty you're paying for your rent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's what I have to -- that's what I have to pay to take the train to go to work every month [LAUGH].  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's just to get to work, that's just the train.  Then I have to pay three hundred --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- eighty dollars a year for parking on top of that, so it's like --
R:  That is totally -- I m- --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- Dana[?] told me that, um, they are raising the -- they're upping the subway fares too.
L:  Yeah, that's what [MN] -- my subway just went from one forty to one eighty, and -- bu- [MN] -- but then again, at the same point, we've gotten no raises in the last three years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So our cost of living [LAUGH] -- yeah, everything's going up around us, but nothing's going up, like, for our own pay checks.  
R:  Yeah [MN] --
L:  And you can't even -- 
R:  -- scary.
L:  -- yeah, it's scary 'cause you can't even bring it up, 'cause I talked to my boss, I'm like, "You know, we're not getting a raise?"  Like, "Yeah, but be happy you have a job".  I'm like, "Ha ha", [LAUGH] you know?  If that's the attitude --
R:  She said that to you?  Oh, my God.
L:  Yeah, the attitude -- if, like, that's the attitude, the second the market picks up, I'm outta here, you know?
R:  Yeah, seriously.
L:  It's like -- you know, it's, like, ain't gonna put up with that crap.
R:  Yeah.  Totally --
L:  But -- 
R:  -- I know, like I -- I just got hired at Barnes and Noble book store, you know?  And, um, [NOISE] [several inaudible words] and I'm just thinking [inaudible] I worked at this little mom and pop, like, incense store at eight dollars --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now I'm working for Barnes and Noble, this, like, million trillion dollar company, and they're gonna pay me this much?  Like, what?  And they're all, like, supposedly, you know, liberal, like, progressive company, "We care about our employees".  It's like, you don't though, because you're not giving me any benefits.  Like, I had medicine that cost me, like, I don't know, a hundred dollars every three months or something.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] I pay for it on credit card that I can't afford to pay off, and -- I don't know, it's just, I really am getting --
L:  Do they have, like, a, um, post office near you?
R:  A post office?  Yeah.
L:  Try to get a postal job --
R:  You know what, they --
L:  -- at least you get benefits.
R:  -- totally, you're right.  And I even saw some in the paper --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that, um, that -- that they are hiring at the post -- the post office job.  But seriously I am afraid to do that, because I get followed by weirdos everywhere I go and I could just see myself walking through some neighbourhood, having some nasty dude, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- following me, because it is -- that's just my luck, you know, and I'm --
L:  Well -- 
R:  -- just like, uh --
L:  Like I say, 'cause I don't know how it is out there, but, like, in New York, most of the delivery people are male.  The females usually are behind the counters in the post office, and they still get paid --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at the same rate.  Like, they h- -- they pay whatever, eight ninety five is the minimum, you know, to start --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at least here.  And then you have the benefits.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it's a government -- it's a government job, that -- that's [inaudible].  If it's a -- if it's a behind the counter job, well all you gotta do is just, you know, take people's cash all day long and it's -- at least you get the medical to go along with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the salary, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I mean, I could do that too.  But actually, yeah, I -- I -- I'm going back to school because, um, yeah.  It's -- it's just -- it's not fair.  I wanna start doing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a little [inaudible] tantrum and kicking my feet up in the air, but it's just like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I really -- and, like, the thing is, is my roommate is on workers' comp, even though, like, nothing's really wrong with her or whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  And she never works, parties all the time, goes out every night, brings people home every night, when I have to be at work at seven in the morning every single day.  And I'm still -- can never go to the bar because I'm so broke.  It's like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what is wrong here?  It's just -- messed up, so yeah ... they need to -- they need to do that.  I hope whoever's listening --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- can, um, tell, you know the powers that be, five fifteen, what year is this?  You know, come on.
L:  Exactly.  The rates are just -- it's -- it's ridiculous, five fifty.  I don't know, that's just --
R:   It really is, that's -- that's really [NOISE] -- that's quite sad.  Especially because the people who have to work those five fifteen jobs, um, have to do the grossest stuff ever.  It's like I was reading a job application, and this girl was a custodian for a high school --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and she got paid five fifteen an hour. 
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm like, she has to clean up, like, poop and puke, like, every day --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and got paid five fifteen.  I'm like, that is morally --
L:  Yeah, in --
R:  -- gross.
L:  -- New York -- New York custodians make some pretty decent money.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, because you're prob- -- you're getting paid, you know, it's union, so you're getting paid city rates and then, um, you got the benefits on top of that, and then [NOISE] [inaudible] overtime.  So, I mean, there's some custodians who make eighty, ninety thousand dollars a year.  Those are the high end --
R:  Jeeze.
L:  -- guys, but then, you know, regular -- regular custodian stuff is probably thirty to forty, then they get the overtime, you know, that kind of deal [LIPSMACK].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And if some do multiple -- multiple schools, say at the same time, say if they're getting paid from multiple schools at the same time, you know, that kind of deal.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause it's cheaper for New York City to do that, than to pay two --
