L:  Hi, my name is Ellen.
R:  Hello, Ellen.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine.
R:  Okay.  And the topic of the day is ...
L:  And who are you?
R:  My name is Amy Butcher.
L:  Amy?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, Amy.  It's what you look for -- what's the most important thing you look for in a life partner.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], well, I would probably say that -- you know, that trust -- probably trust.
L:  Yeah, that's a good one.  But I don't -- I don't know how much trust there is in the world nowadays.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, uh, I agree.  [LAUGH]  Yes, I agree.
L:  I mean, people are together for years and years and ...
R:  And they find out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lotta secrets.  Yes, I agree.  I, um ...
L:  I also think that one important thing is the ability to, you know, spend all this time with somebody, get along with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, because if you -- if you don't get along or if you don't have anything to do with each other it's kind of an unhappy ...
R:  Right.  Relationship.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I agree.  I think that, um, you know, you have to get along with that person and really love that person before you actually commit to a long term relationship.
L:  But a life partner doesn't necessarily I don't think have to mean, you know, a husband and wife.
R:  No.
L:  It could be -- you know, it could even be like, you know, you -- you know, you and your sister.
R:  Well, that's true.  That's true.
L:  You know, who never wanted to get married and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- they have to -- to get along and ...
R:  Right.  [COUGH]  Which I have several sisters that I don't -- that I don't get along with so ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Yes, I know that feeling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, well, you know, the saying you can pick your friends but not your relatives.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  You know?  I think it's because, you know, everybody -- its -- this is a hard concept for me to grasp --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but everybody thinks different and sees different.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they see the same -- you look at one thing and you see it one way and someone else looks at it and sees it another way.
R:  Right.
L:  That was a real hard thing for me to grasp because, you know, I would look at people and judge them and say well, I wouldn't do that, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or something like that and -- and, you know, I think people do the same thing when they're looking for a life partner, you know, they're like well, you know, I think that this person should've acted this way with me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, that person might not even have a clue that, you know -- that that's what they -- you want them to do.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I think sometimes we have expectations of certain people and, um -- and they're not even aware of what we expect of them or we think that they should do or ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. I agree.
L:  But you think that you -- you know, sometimes you react like -- like they do know.
R:  Yeah, and get upset --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and get ...  I've done that before.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I -- I've been at fault before.  Yes.
L:  Well, I think that -- that one of the things that best helped me not to do that with people is, uh, training that I went through where --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm sure you probably have done this -- where they show the picture to the class --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you have to say what you see in the picture --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and like, you know -- and the, uh, famous one is the one -- half the class will look at it and say that's a -- a young lady and the other half see the old witch in it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and it's just -- it's -- it taught me, you know, like that people actually could see the same thing and see it different --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- and I don't -- I think that that's one of the things you have to do when you try to pick a life partner.
R:  Mhm.  That's true.
L:  Someone that, you know, you gotta realize that they don't think exactly like you.  But --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but then again you don't want 'em to think too different from you either.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Well, I -- I have been married for thirteen years.  So, you know, me and my husband get along really well --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- and -- and I have very -- you know, I have very few friends that -- that I could depend on, you know, that are people that, um, are -- you know, we're alike --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in life.
L:  Right.  Well, this is my third marriage.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  But I think I got -- I think I got a winner this time.
R:  Well, third time's a charm now we say.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Because he -- and -- and the -- the attributes that he has that I think are really good for a life partner is, you know, he's -- you know, he's -- he bends enough to my -- to, you know, my will but still stands strong enough to show his own will --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and that's -- that's important to me because I'm very -- I'm kind of aggressive --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so I can't -- I can't have a man that's, um, too nice --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I'll walk all over him.
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  But I can't have a man that's mean because the two of us will just clash.
R:  Right.  So, you, uh ...
L:  So, he ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Huh?
R:  I'm -- I was going to say that you all probably just get along really well.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because for the most part he couldn't care a less, you know, like if I wanna do something -- you know, he picks his battles, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  He -- he doesn't really care, you know, what I -- what I want as long as it's within reason, you know?  But if he doesn't like it he'll stand his ground, but for the most part, you know, he -- he has his own things he likes to do and he's real worried about it.  So ...
R:  Well -- well, that's good.  That's -- that's about like -- the way my husband is, you know, he's -- he's my first love, but he's the only one I've had so far [LAUGH] -- so far.
L:  Well, I hope he's the only one.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]  But, see, now my mother was married three times and my sister -- one of my sister's has been married three times.  So ...
L:  Who was married three times?
R:  My Mom.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And then my sister, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- older sister she -- she's on her, uh, fourth marriage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, you know, it's not so much that the third time determines -- it's just you gotta keep doing it 'til you get it right.
R:  Get the -- get the right person, that's right.
L:  That's right.  And if you're lucky enough to do it first time -- and I think lots of people do it the first time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's just harder to do it the first time --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause you -- you know, you don't have no mistakes to learn from.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  Well, now, me and my husband we only dated, um, three months before we got married.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- which I just knew that we got along so well, you know, it just seemed like we were meant for each other --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we have gotten on well -- gotten along well with each other over the past thirteen years.  So, you know, we're really happy.
L:  Yeah.  I met my husband online.
R:  Oh, did you really?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Well -- and -- and you've been married for a while or ...?
L:  No, we've been married two years.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you have children?
R:  Yes, I have two children.  I have a, uh, twelve year old daughter and an eight year old daughter.
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...
L:  I have a twenty three year old son and a two year old grandson.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Mhm.  And it's -- you know, it's kinda hard on him because, you know, I'm not with his father anymore.
R:  Right.
L:  Basically I just -- basically walked outta that relationship into this one.  So, it's kinda like he went away to school with his Dad in the house and came back from, you know, on vacation with, you know, Mom's got a new husband.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I mean, you know, sometimes if you just couldn't get along with each other there's no use in staying --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- you know, in a marriage if you're not happy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, you know -- and I've always -- I always tell my husband, you know, if it gets to the point and you're not happy, you know, you need to let me know.  Don't just stay here if you're not happy, you know?  And I wouldn't want him to stay here just for the children either, you know? 
L:  Yeah.  No, that's true 'cause my -- my son told me that that -- 'cause he knows that basically we more or less stayed together because -- you know, to raise him --
R:  Right.
L:  "-- and he -- and he didn't tell me, but he told his cousins and they told me that he said, um, "I wish my parents had never done that.  I -- I would rather that they had went their separate ways and found happiness somewhere else instead of yelling and screaming and ...?
R:  Right.  'Cause it probably hurt him more than you realized --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, by you staying together and not getting along and, um -- you know, and he kinda -- he probably sees that too.
L:  See, that's -- that's why I'm saying I think that's one of the most important things to be able to get along.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's a good thing if you love each other right away, but sometimes -- sometimes that comes later.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It c- -- you know, it comes different or ...
R:  Well, you know, everyone -- you know, when you first get married, you know, you think -- oh, you know, you're so love and -- and you are.  But, you know, usually after the first year or two, I mean, you still love that person, but it's not like, you know what I'm saying, that first --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, new experience and all that and -- and you really have to get along with someone before you can really, you know, be with that person, you know, to -- to build a relationship with that person.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  And I think it depends a lot on like where you live, what kind of upbringing you have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things like that determine, you know, what kind -- how you choose your life partner too because, you know, like for example maybe someone grew up dirt poor --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they might want to look for somebody who is rich.
R:  Right.
L:  Maybe somebody who, you know, grew up in a -- in a house full of a lotta children might say --
