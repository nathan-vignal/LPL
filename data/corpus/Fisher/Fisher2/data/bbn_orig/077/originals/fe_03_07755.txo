L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  My name is Patricia Fair, I'm from Tennessee, Nashville.
L:  I am Rhonda from Atlanta, Georgia.
R:  All right.  [COUGH]  You know, I have to say, I don't have a whole lot of information on the minimum wage.  Um, I do feel like, um, five dollars and fifteen cents is probably not adequate though, uh, but I don't know that I would want it to go to more than five dollars and twenty five cents.
L:  Well, you've gotta think most people that work minimum wage, uh, from what I gather, are teenagers.
R:  [COUGH] Mhm.
L:  And, um, I -- even -- I'm twenty five years old and my first job was ten years ago and I made eight dollars an hour. [SIGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So I can't imagine any adults living off of five dollars and something cents an hour.
R:  No, I quite agree, they could not.  There's -- there's no way in --in today's market place and in today's grocery and u- u- uh, utility cost and things.  But I don't -- I -- I do think at one time they were considering, uh, having a minimum wage that was one thing for teenagers and one thing for other age workers.  I don't know that that would be legal but that would be a way to have kids who just were gonna work, mm, fast foods jobs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have availability of that job to them because they're not really supporting themselves.  Whereas, um, actual workers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who are in industry [COUGH] and supporting a family and child on that.
L:  Well, what I think -- I mean, I just think it's odd that, okay if somebody's working at McDonald's for five dollars and fifteen cents an hour, uh, after taxes and everything that probably comes out to like, four seventy a -- an hour maybe?
R:  [MN] Right.
L:  And then you gotta think of value meal there. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  You, uh, [NOISE] I mean, do they have to work a whole hour just to buy a [MN], you know, a meal?
R:  A meal.  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's -- it's quite bad.
R:  Right.  What would you think would be appropriate?  Would you think, um, six?  Would you think six fifty?
L:  Well, the thing that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- bothers me is if they drive the price of -- of minimum wage up, do you think everyone else in the world would go up?
R:  Yes.
L:  And --
R:  I don't think everything but I think essentially, uh, a lot, that's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the thing.  And, uh, for a worker -- for a worker who is not, uh, minimum wage, sometimes it's to their benefit because obviously their salary then has to be incrementally increased.  But for, uh, consumers who are purchasing products or services, I think the price is just passed on -- the wage increase is passed on to us.  And, um, I know that right now I am, um, I am, uh, retired, I am sixty five.  And I work for six dollars an hour as an usher. [COUGH]  And this is at our Tennessee Performing Arts Center.  Well of course, it's, um, kind of like a hobby and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- kind of like an opportunity to see a play and --
L:  Well, you probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- also get a [MN], you know, some -- most retired people have, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a pension or --
R:  I have other sources of income obviously.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is not my source of income.  And -- and so my six dollars is just put in, you know, just automatically deposited in a savings account.  And -- and, uh, so, you know, six dollars is sufficient because I'm not supporting myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, for people who -- who truly are, uh, [MN] -- who knows, you know, uh, it's almost -- it almost takes ten dollars an hour for it be a living wage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In today's time.  To -- to have any discretionary income at all.  And of course I'm not really familiar with how much, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- food stamps are now available and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- subsidized housing and things like that.  So that, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, are you -- are -- do you think that they are voting on -- on upping it?
L:  I th- -- I think they are.  I -- I --
R:  Obviously they are.
L:  I didn't, uh, I have a lotta driving I do and I've -- I only listen to AM talk radio.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] and, uh, I don't know.  I mean, it's like --
R:  What have they said?  Have you heard any talk on this?
L:  I [MN] -- I've -- I've heard them griping --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- about it. [LAUGH]
R:  Griping that it should not be raised?
L:  Mm, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, they were saying, you know, a- and then they were griping about giving people who make minimum wage tax cuts, and then they -- they were saying, "Why should we give them tax cuts, they don't pay any taxes?" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Why should we give them any breaks?  They -- they barely pay any taxes now, they -- they get all kinds of government help and, I mean, I j- -- I just -- I could not imagine -- you know, every time I go to McDonald's or something I think of this -- I -- I always see somebody in their mid thirties --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, I wonder, uh, do they have a spouse or -- that also works, you know, a -- a good paying job?  And occasionally I'll see older people working at fast foods.  But then I think, well, they probably bought their house thirty years ago and it's either paid for or they have a very, very low mortgage payment.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, and --
R:  Right.
L:   -- then it's like -- my -- my husband makes a little over -- well, he makes about forty five a year.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  [LIPSMACK] And, uh, I know our mortgage payment is right at a thousand dollars and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we're barely scraping through.
R:  Right, right.
L:  I mean -- and then we have a child and we don't have any type of government help so --
R:  Right.  That's the thing.  Well now, see, I have, um, I have retired but my home is paid for.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I decided I would not retire until my home was paid for and I was able to retire slightly early.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I did work for one company that, uh, paid a -- a -- went ahead and paid your, uh, benefit at aged sixty two.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then I could not go out because of the medical.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, for people -- I -- I don't know I -- I -- I feel real ambiguous, uh, I don't want it to go too high and yet in realism I know that that is not a living wage.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't really know what the solution is.  And -- and I think in -- in that way talk radio, while I don't usually agree with it [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because they tend to be so conservative, generally, um, I do think it's correct that the person paying five fifteen or whatever is not paying any taxes.  And -- and of course I think the new tax cut did give childcare credits and they were poo poohing that, that someone who didn't even pay tax could get childcare credits.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  And it's like, "Duh!"  You know, what is that about? [COUGH]
L:  I heard them talking about, yeah, these people that make, [MN] you know, that aren't paying any taxes, that have six or seven children that are being paid for by the state, they're gonna be getting four hundred dollar apiece for these children.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they were --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really complaining about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm agreeing with 'em but then I'm thinking, "Yeah, but you probably have a four hundred thousand dollar home and a -- a fifty thousand dollar SUV, w- --"
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  "-- why are you complaining that these --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- people are gonna get such a --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- you know, minute amount of money?"
R:  Right, right.
L:  And so ...
R:  Uh, it's, um, i- i- it's such a gray area.  It's like sometimes I think what I think, um, and what I'm really willing to do, do not match. [LAUGH]  And it's a little embarrassing to see that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about myself.  And, um, um, it's -- it's, uh, it's funny because you think, well, you do, you know, you really want to support this and that and I think what I resent is when I see or hear, and sometimes the hearing part is exploited so people will feel this way, um, when someone who is using the system in such a way as to gauge because you and I did work or are working to pay into the system.  And if people would just use whatever they have, no matter what their salary was, you know, uh, but people seem to know how to get around the system, or learn very fast, and -- and -- and I think that takes us all down, I think we all pay a -- a large price for that kind of greed or that kind of subversiveness.
L:  Yes.  I mean -- I mean as -- uh, I have a son who's had three open heart surgeries.
R:  Oh, God bless you.
L:  And he is on a formula called --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- Pediasure, which is ten dollars --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- a day for us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, when we were going through some hard times I went to apply to get some type of supplement or --
R:  Right, some assistance.
L:  -- this stuff called Wick[?], you know, because three hundred dollars a month is a lot w- --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- back when my husband was making only thirty two thousand.
