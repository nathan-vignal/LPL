L:  Hi, my name is Roxanna from Dallas.
R:  Hi, I'm Sandy from Chicago.  [PAUSE]  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, hi.
L:  Okay.
R:  How are you today?
L:  Hi.  Good.  How are you?
R:  So, we're supposed to talk about ...  I'm good.  I'm good.  It's nice here today.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Okay.  So, how do you feel a- about the minimum wage?
R:  Minimum wage.  What did it say?  It was being increased to five fifteen an hour?
L:  Yes.  And do you think that would be enough?
R:  Um, you know, I would find it very hard to live on minimum wage.  I -- I mean, I -- I -- we are certainly -- we are kinda above that and -- and I just -- I remember when I used to make minimum wage.  I don't know how anybody could raise a family on that.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I think they should raise -- just ra- raise it up.  I don't think that's enough to raise a family or anything for somebody, you know?  They would just be living, um, in poverty.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- I -- it's definitely a poverty level.  However, I mean, there's plenty of other countries where they don't have a minimum wage, like Hong Kong and, um, in Hong Kong it's -- you know, your skills drive the market, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  If they don't have any marketable skills then, um [NOISE], you know, what are you supposed to pay 'em?  Just for showing up?
L:  Yes.  That's right.
R:  And I don't know if that's really right either.
L:  Yeah.  It really depends on what --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- type of job they're doing too and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it'll all depend -- like the minimum wage -- maybe if it's not a very unskilled job ...
R:  Right.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and -- and -- and I think it's true.  I mean, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- does that mean it includes benefits?  I mean, that's the thing when you start telling employers that you have to pay a certain employee this much then where does it stop?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You -- you have to tell them, "Hey, now you have to give them this sorta benefit".  I don't -- I don't know.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they should -- they should be doing something about it and -- and perhaps we should be going to be the senator or somebody and asking them to raise it up.
R:  See, I don't know.  I -- I -- I -- we own a business.  So, I -- I look at it from the other point of it where we don't pay our employees minimum wage, we give them more than minimum wage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, you know, there's a lot of added expenses in that for employers for -- you know, have to pay in the other half of social security.  That increases your unemployment that you have to pay.  It's -- and that puts a big burden on small businesses.
L:  Yeah.  It is.  Uh-uh.
R:  So, when you're doubly taxing these small businesses then you're essentially putting them outta business because then they have to raise the price of cost for their goods that they're passing on to the consumer.  It's just the consumer that's footing the bills.
L:  Yeah.  They have to raise the price of production and goods and all that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, I mean, it's definitely not enough for somebody to live on.  Employers have to take a look at that.  I just don't know if forcing somebody and saying, "Hey, you have to pay this person this much" is what is --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the answer.
L:  Yeah.  And it really hasn't increased much over the years, maybe just about fifteen cents or something.
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.  I remember when I was in high school, probably about ten years ago, I think I made four seventy five was the minimum wage --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when I worked.
L:  Yeah.  So, it --
R:  So ...
L:  -- it just -- it's not exactly growing, it's just like it's -- it's gonna be just every ten years and that's ridiculous.  It should be just about every two or three years or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It hasn't been pretty stagnant.  I guess -- oh, that's not really, you know, um, representative of the cost of inflation and the cost of living increases that have occurred.
L:  Yes, that's right, and many of them, um, it depends on like, um, where they live and the housing and some parts are just too expensive to live and get a house.
R:  Well, exactly.  Look at the cost of houses.  Houses have risen.  I mean, just in my area alone in one year our houses have raised eleven percent --
L:  Yeah.  That's ...
R:  -- and we're -- and we're just right out- -- right outside of Chicago.  A regular person could not afford my house --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- making one -- making one income on minimum wage --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- you couldn't afford a regular house.
L:  Yeah.  They would have to go look for an apartment or something.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And who wants to live like that for the rest of their life?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You don't.  You wanna get up --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know -- and do better.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And some of them pay -- just to find it hard to go -- go to college and get a higher education.  So, they would have just -- just be sticking to working the minimum wage and five dollars and fifteen cents an hour.
R:  Mhm.  But, yeah, I -- I guess it isn't enough.  Well, it certainly isn't enough.  But, um, when do they say enough is enough?  I mean, are you gonna go to a small business and say all of a sudden well, we're gonna increase the minimum wage to seven or eight dollars an hour?  You can't really do that either without any --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sort of notice and without, you know, expecting some economic pitfalls --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to happen because you're gonna be impacting small business with that.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  I think that the small businesses are gonna benefit from that and they don't have to pay their employees that much.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.  So, I think it would benefit them really well and, um, not, uh -- and on the other hand, you know, somebody that's just making ends meet and has a family, maybe a single mother or something that would be hard for them to live on that.
R:  It is hard.  Yeah.  I can see that.  I was in that boat.  It -- it is hard to make ends meet.  But there's also a lot of government subsidies and stuff for people that don't make that much money 'cause there's W.I.C.K. and there's, um, food stamps and things like that.  I mean, I haven't qualified for that sort of stuff in a long time.  So, I don't know.  But I guess when you're working that hard you don't wanna have to rely on that sort of stuff either.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  There's a lot of government assistance.  But, yeah, some -- I mean, even if they work at a job and that's not very skillful they should just turn it a little bit more than -- it's not going -- it's not going very much through the years.
R:  [COUGH] Um ...
L:  So, I think, yeah, that some- something should be done about it and -- and a lotta people should -- I don't know -- maybe a petition or something to make it change or to -- for the government to consider increasing the minimum wage.
R:  Yeah, I think they should increase it, but I also think too that people need to have skills in order to be paid for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what they're doing, you know?  I -- I mean ...
L:  Yeah.  It really depends.  Mhm.  Some jobs --
R:  It would depend on the type of job.
L:  -- some jobs would -- they -- that would be fine for some jobs, um, the five fifteen an hour, but I guess if it's really like, um -- like you said, when -- like in ot- other countries like Hong Kong how they pay them over there then ...
R:  Right.  They don't have a minimum -- a minimum wage there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just -- it's the way the market is.  They -- they have a flat tax there and, um, it's -- your skills drive -- drive the market.  If you're able to make so much it's because you have the ability to make that much and not because you're relying on the government to say okay, we're only gonna pay you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- this -- minimum wages.  There's no minimum wage.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.  So, I think that's -- that's a benefit of living in this country too that we have a minimum wage.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  At least, yeah, it's better than other countries.  Mhm.
R:  [PAUSE] Um, what do you think the minimum wage should be increased too then?
L:  Um, I think it -- it would be reasonable to increase -- increase it like, um, five seventy five, something like that --
R:  And what ...?
L:  -- pretty close to six an hour.
R:  What is it now?  It's only five fifteen?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think -- forty -- so, for forty hours a week it's five dollars an hour, they're only making two hundred dollars a week?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know how you live on that.  That's only eight hundred dollars a month.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I mean, not even a one bedroom apartment can you get for eight hundred sometimes.
R:  No.
L:  It's -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just hard.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That would be hard.  But ...
L:  Yeah.  So, it really would depend.  I mean, a lot of skillful, um, workers out there they would be earning more than that and then some of them that are not so skilled would have to be stuck on that minimum wage.  What do you think it should be in- increased to?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, you know, I don't know.  I mean, I -- there was a time when I only made eight hours an hour and I managed to live on that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you do -- I mean, you have to look at the overall impact of how it's gonna affect -- you know, it puts a big burden on -- on the small business owners and, I mean, even bigger business owners.  But I don't know.  Like, big corporations I don't know how it'd affect them.  But I -- from owning a business I could see where if we had to pay somebody another --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because the government was making us them another three, four dollars an hour over a week long, um, you know, pay check for a couple of employees that's a lotta money.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  I mean, for a small family run business that would be not necessarily a good thing.  But, yeah, maybe for the bigger corporations like I.B.M. or something then that would be fine --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- depending on ...  I'm sorry?
R:  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, I was talking to my daughter.  She's interrupting.  I told her ...  My husband's on the other line.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So, really depending on, you know -- I -- I would agree that, you know, if it's a family run business and -- it really doesn't necessarily need to increase.  It would just stay the same.  That's fine.
R:  But then it wouldn't be a minimum wage.  You couldn't do that.  It would have to be the same across the board.
L:  Mhm.  Well, just the minimum wage that would be fine for family run businesses, but not the bigger corporations.
R:  Right.  [NOISE]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know how -- I -- I don't know what it would be -- should be increased to.  But I know that five fifteen isn't enough because you can't -- I mean, if you have a kid --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and a wife and then they're both gonna have to work in order to support them and so who watches the kids then at that point?
L:  Right.  Yeah.  That would be -- yeah, it would be very tough on the parents and especially single parents and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- especially if they have a lot of kids and five fifteen and hour --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and eight hundred a month that wouldn't ...
R:  There's no ex- -- there's no extras on minimum wage.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  There, uh -- there's no extra -- there's no extra money for anything on minimum wage.
L:  Yeah.  They -- yeah, and they would probably just have to w- work overtime and -- and do you think they would probably get that or what?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Probably not if they're making 'em pay 'em extra.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So, when -- when, um -- when did the minimum wage all start?  Do you have any idea?
R:  Um, minimum wage started, um, in the -- during the Great Depression I believe when, um, Franklin Roosevelt started all sorts of, um, government grants, like the Tennessee Value Cessation and guaranteed workers a minimum amount --
