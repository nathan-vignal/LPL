L:  Hello.
R:  How ya doing?
L:  Hi, doing well.
R:  Hi.  I'm Mark.  How you doing?
L:  I'm Mary.  Pretty good, yeah.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] All right.
L:  Well --
R:  So, we've gotta talk about life partners.
L:  Yes.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, well [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what did -- what did she just say again about what we're looking for?  Is that what she said?
R:  [several inaudible words]
L:  What are we looking for in a life partner?
R:  -- what's important in a life partner, correct.  [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, you there?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] I guess I was, um -- I -- I'm on the cell phone so it goes in and out.
L:  Oh, okay.  All right.
R:  I can't use my regular home phone because I get call waiting and that supposedly kicks the calls of.
L:  Oh, it does.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- supposedly.
L:  Say, do you know about these calls?  Have you ever got paid for doing any of these calls?
R:  Um, this is the first time I'm doing 'em.  I did one last night and this is my second one so I really don't know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Okay, I've done quite a few and I h- just haven't received anything so I'm just wondering but ...
R:  Do you -- have you done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  'em recently?
L:  Yeah, well, it was in the last six weeks or so.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, um, I would say a lot of them take six to eight weeks.
L:  Okay.
R:  [inaudible] Uh, especially like I know like the surveys do.  Because like when you go to do the survey or something along those lines --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they don't get paid by the companies until after they finish the whole survey and put like a report together.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  So then, now they put the whole report together.  Now whatever company they were doing that survey for then pays them and then they pay you out.
L:  I see.  Okay, well that makes sense.  Oh, what do you look for in a life partner?
R:  Um [SIGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I would say someone who like you really get along [NOISE] with, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And not necessarily have to have the same, like, things you like to do or all that but like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like just you can get along with m- -- you're on a friendship [NOISE] side, as well as, you know, [NOISE] more than that.
L:  Right, right.  Probably somebody that ... 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, sometimes I think maybe somebody that's just a little bit more opposite than you in some ways.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  B- because if -- if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're somebody that's kind of hyper and maybe a little quick tempered, it's kinda nice to have the other partner be somebody that's a little more passive, maybe.
R:  Yeah, calm you down, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  Or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something like that.
R:  Yeh.  Add some balance to it all.
L:  Yes, that's right.  
R:  [NOISE] 'Cause --
L:  Um ...
R:  -- I could see us ca- -- I'm more calmer.  If I was high strung --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my wife was high strung --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and once one gets going, the other one gets going --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- oh, forget it.  That's gonna raise like a -- 
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like a -- like into a tornado.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  And I think some --
R:  You know?
L:  -- couples are like that, you know, and [PAUSE] they lead a pretty combative relationship.
R:  Very true.
L:  But, um, I think honesty's a pretty big one.
R:  Honesty, trust.
L:  Trust [MN].
R:  Yeah, I would think like, you know -- you gotta -- if you wanna have things that are different well, you also have to be able to also do the stuff that you don't like to do 'cause the other one does kind of, you know?
L:  Definitely.
R:  And even if you don't like it, don't say you really hate it because [several inaudible words] get in trouble.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's right.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's right.  It's, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- a little bit of give and take on both parts all the time, you know?
R:  Absolutely.
L:  Yep, um, [LAUGH] my husband's in the back room saying, "I give and she takes".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's not true.
R:  Oh, oh, I -- I would say the same thing.  I give and my wife takes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Whoa. 
R:  Or I give --
L:  So, we would disagree.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um ...
R:  Yes, that's sure.  She would definitely like k- kick me in the butt.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  Yes, um, see, what else can we say about that?
R:  I didn't -- you know, I [MN] -- the other thing like when you have the relationships and stuff that you gotta try to find, you know, k- the thing is not what you really -- what you give for a relationship.  It's is that you gotta find time, treat a relationship because --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I know for me, the hours from work are crazy.
L:  Yep.
R:  So, it's like the hardest thing to do is find time so sometimes you just gotta like, just say, "All right, I'm taking off this day" just because you gotta find time or just --
L:  Right.  Yeh, what --
R:  For us.  See, we [inaudible] to stop because you'll just go c- -- you just keep going and you don't even pay attention, you know?
L:  Yeah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you gotta set your priorities.  What's more important?
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And I think that -- that a marriage is something that you keep putting on the back burner because it's -- it's something safe that's gonna be there --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- when you're done and when you're ready --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for it but then it doesn't always work like that.
R:  Yeah, I mean, uh, I -- I don't have kids but I would assume that if you get to the point where's there's kids then it's even more where there's not enough time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for your relationship.  Because now you've got work, you gotta take the kids to wherever you gotta do and then you still gotta try to find that time, huh.
L:  That's right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Just [several inaudible words].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] [PAUSE] Oh, yeah, oh.  My husband's just wondering if -- if we ever get charged on this end --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with these phone calls but ...
R:  Well, y- we're dialing an eight hundred number.  The eight six six is an eight hundred number so there should be no charge.
L:  Should be no charge, yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't think so either.  But, uh --
R:  [MN] [several inaudible words] on your next phone bill. 
L:  What's that?
R:  It probably would have been in -- on -- I think if you did one, like that was a couple of months ago -- a month ago, whatever four weeks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it shou- y- you would have seen a charge on your phone bill.
L:  Well, that's what I would have thought too and I -- I didn't see anything.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I mean, I know eight six six is an eight hundred number 'cause it's the new one since they ran out of eight -- eight hundred to eight eight eights.  They went to eight six six so ...
L:  Oh, yeah, yep.  So ...
R:  I mean, I think, actually your question when we opened up.  If you have a question I know the email for this [inaudible] has like a number where you can call in and talk to an operator.
L:  Oh, it does?
R:  They should -- they should be able to pull up your account and give 'em your pin --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, you'll go, you know, "When am I su- -- what am I supposed to expect to get paid for this?" you know?
L:  Yeah, maybe I'll -- maybe I'll do that.  Um, I like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- doing these phone calls.  They're -- they're kinda interesting.  Sometimes you get on a subject.  This -- this is a little bit more difficult to talk about tonight.  I don't know why.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, the thing --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is it's -- it's one of those topics that -- like last night I was talking about pets.  I'm not sure if you did that one?
L:  I did too.  Yeah, that was fun.
R:  And I wasn't -- we -- we were just -- she just rolled from one animal to another to another.
L:  Exactly.
R:  This is like, "Yeah, all right, what do you want to have in a relationship?"  All right, "X.Y.Z." --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah, that was -- I enjoyed that phone call last night a lot.  But, um, marriage that's kind of -- you kind basically know what you -- what you look for in a partner, you know, and I think honesty and trust and somebody you get along with and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all that's pretty -- pretty basic, you know?  Um [LIPSMACK] ...
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I think that once you get past like the getting along and you go out on a couple of dates you perceive getting along, the interests may not match but you get along when you're doing whatever, you know, gets along with th- you know, the interests of the other person, then you can start seeing -- then that's where it kind of builds from 'cause you know first time you're like -- I don't know.  Obviously you -- you're looking at looks or, "I think that person's hot" --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- or whatever then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then, you know -- then from there it winds up going more up into, "All right, do we get along?"
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  And then from there, then it builds more as in, "All right, we're going for a w- uh, for a while, now I'm gonna get more serious" you know and then --
L:  Yeah.  It gets a --
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  -- little -- gets a little deeper.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Little more richer and stuff.  And then I think when you go through your hard times, I don't know how long you've been married, but when you go through your hard times sometimes, that even makes you more --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- more tighter to ya.  You know what I mean?  Because you've been there and you've got through it and ...
R:  Sure.  I would agree 'cause, um, getting laid off thr- two and a half years ago, yeah, that was tough.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, yep.
R:  You know, and trust me, you wanna talk about two people banging heads and, you know, going -- going nuts but then you get through it and then, you know, now it's -- it's actually better.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...
L:  Because you've been through some hard times and you've been there for each other.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yep.  And the other thing too, I think, the longer you're married, um, you kind of learn to, you know -- you might just get real upset with each other and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- explode and carry on, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But you don't hold grudges.  You get over it quick.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know, don't -- don't carry that because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- something just kinda sparked you off and maybe it was [MN] -- maybe it was something that didn't even have anything to do with what you're arguing about but, um, just let her go then and move on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't -- don't be thinking about it and bringing it back up and ...
R:  Exactly.  Especially I don't go to sleep, like really pissed off.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You try not to [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] I've done that but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they say you're not supposed to do that but ...
R:  Yeah, they say because you never know what's gonna happen when your sleeping but you know?
L:  Yeah, yep.  I know my husband here, one -- one morning I woke up and for some reason he was laying -- we have a big king size bed and it seems like we lay so far apart but this particular morning he was laying quite -- quite close up to me and I woke up and he was laying really still.  And I thought, you know, in this half dead state of mind, I looked at him --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I thought "Is he dead?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and 'cause I couldn't see any breathing and then I touched him and he was cold.
R:  Right.
L:  So, then my mind does this stuff real fast, you know?
R:  Yeah, yeah, you race -- racing.
L:  It races and then I said, "Doug?" and he didn't answer me and he said he heard me. I think he was -- I think he kind of thought the same thing or something.  He was gonna trick me.
R:  Right.
L:  And then it seemed like a long time and I finally got a response out of him, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But that made me kinda think afterwards, you know.  "What if -- what if he would have been dead?"  You know.  That would have been a awful -- awful --
R:  Very true.
L:  -- thing.  You know.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And that happens.  But ... [NOISE] [PAUSE] [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You didn't hear that, did you?  [LAUGH] He says --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- "Does that mean I'm gonna change my ways now?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Like I'm such a bad person, right?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well ...
R:  Oh, I -- I have to -- I know, I have to take his side, you know, being from the same, um, sex, uh, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm always outnumbered.
R:  See that.  [LAUGH]
L:  I was raised with a whole bunch of brothers and no sisters and then I married [MN] and had a -- had a son and it's like --
R:  Ah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so I'm always --
R:  A guy -- every -- every guy's dream to have the son.
L:  Yep, yep.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then we had a daughter and then we had another son, so ...
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  And now we g- --
R:  Just wanna --
