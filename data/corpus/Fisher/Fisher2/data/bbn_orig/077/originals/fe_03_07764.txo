R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Judy Rentmouth[?].
R:  Uh, my name is Hal.
L:  How are you?
R:  Hi, fine.  Good evening.  I'm -- I live in, um, Arizona.  Where are you based?
L:  Illinois.
R:  Illinois, okay, great.  Okay, well, I didn't even know they'd raised the minimum wage [LAUGH], so ...
L:  Um, well I think Illinois is going for, um, [MN] close to around six dollars an hour.
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  They've been fighting for it for quite a while.
R:  Yeah, um --
L:  Which I think is right, um --
R:  I think it's right.
L:  -- considering -- well, we have a big, high, um, unemployment rate here and we have a lot of places that don't want unions and that, and, uh, they'll work people for nothing, you know.
R:  Yeah, and that th- -- um, the cost of living is quite high there between the utilities in the winter and --
L:  Um --
R:  -- things like that.
L:  No, not really.
R:  Really?
L:  I don't think it's any much higher than Arizona, considering all your, um, air conditioning and that --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- too.
R:  I have --
L:  You know?
R:  -- mine running right now [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it -- it's -- I think that's great that the state of Illinois passed its own.  I mean, in this state they would, if they could override the federal they would do it.  So, luckily --
L:  Oh, yeah, they would.
R:  -- luckily this country's run on the basis of wh- [MN] -- of what the federal go- -- says goes first [LAUGH].
L:  I think we're lucky to where, um, if we bitch a lot then we get what we want [LAUGH], you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, as long as you keep on bitching, then, we usually get what we want.
R:  Yeah.  That -- and I think in Illin- -- people in Illin- -- Illinois seem a bit more inclined to get to speak their mind about what's right or wrong or fair or not fair than --
L:  Um, I -- I don't know about that.  Um --
R:  Well, here the --
L:  -- we have a -- we have a big political system here coming down from Chicago [LIPSMACK].
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, it goes down to Springfield and we have to fight between that, so we have to gripe quite a bit [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  But at least somebody gripes there and then you get, you know, an effective way -- I guess I'm saying that, um, I've only lived here about five years; I'm actually from California --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and there we have -- you know, people have initiatives there all the time and -- and, um --
L:  Now, see, I don't like California any more.
R:  [MN]
L:  I -- I don't like their ideas, I don't -- I don't like what they're doing.  They're trying to sit theirselves, um -- well, it's -- it's like they -- they passed that one federal law, I can't remember what it was.  It was in the news, they passed a federal law [MN] and then that one township or -- or town there in California said, "We don't have to abide by your federal laws", and changed the law and then, like, what [MN] [LAUGH], you know, what is this about?  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to me, th- that's exactly what they griped about for years, um, want to gripe about how, uh, the South did whatever they wanted to do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  [MN] And now they're doin' the same -- they're doing the same thing.
R:  Yeah, but I think on -- at least on the issue of the, um, the minimum wage, that, um, California tries to do the -- the right thing, you know?  I mean, out here they -- I don't know what there is as far as the state law and everything, I don't even keep abreast of state politics.  I don't keep -- there's no --
L:  I think --
R:  -- point to it.  Um --
L:  -- I think in Illinois our minimum wage right now is five twenty five an hour, if I'm not mistaken.
R:  That's probably fair.
L:  I think so.
R:  You know.
L:  And I think the governor is trying to raise it to up around six dollars.
R:  Which sounds, you know, might -- twenty years ago might have sounded like a lot, but it doesn't sound like a lot any more, so ...
L:  Oh, well.  I worked at Sears years ago for four something an hour, so -- yeah.
R:  Well, when I was a teenager I worked for the minimum which was, back then, was four ten an hour, four twenty five an hour in California.  And even then I found that, you know, like, very [MN] hard to live with, so [LAUGH].
L:  Well, it's very hard to get along on.
R:  Yeah, by the time they take out everything, you figure well what -- what was the point of commuting for that, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So -- you know, it's --
L:  I think it should be raised, I really do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think when we raise it, I think what the companies will find out when we raise it is that, um, with the other wages, that they have to coincide also.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, you know, it -- it's getting to the point, especially in Illinois, [SIGH] that, uh, you're getting paid dirt cheap for, uh, a lot of hard work.
R:  Right.
L:  I know with the job I'm doing, um, at McLeans, uh, candy repack, I mean, we're getting [inaudible] with big boxes of candies.  I mean, we're doing the Snickers and the M and Ms and -- and all this stuff, and I mean, they're heavy.  And we're only getting paid to start out at eight ninety five an hour.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they're saying, "Well, if you raise the minimum wage, then these companies are gonna lose".  No, they're not.  
R:  They -- they say that every time that they try and raise it, and it doesn't -- it doesn't adversely affect anything in a way.
L:  No, it doesn't.
R:  It -- it helps raise the bar, it helps, um, it helps push everyone up actually [MN].
L:  And it should.  Well --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they don't wanna -- they don't wanna put up with the unions, okay.  You know, that's fine, that's what you don't want to do, but the minimum wage should be bigger.  To me, minimum wage should be, uh, in my opinion --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- seven dollars an hour.  But that's just me.
R:  No, I think you're probably right in most -- in most parts of -- I think in large urban areas in particular, that, um, that's justified, you know.  That, um --  
L:  Well, we're not that -- we're really not that big.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Really.  You know, compared to, like, places in California and Arizona and especially Chicago, you know?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh --
R:  Well, I find --
L:  -- I think considering -- I think considering the things they want people to do at minimum wage --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- seven dollars an hour's a fair price.
R:  Right.  Now- -- the way the economy is right now, I was just watching something on [SIGH] television about people, um, you know in the job market and going in for jobs where they were -- interviews where they were being paid, um, you know, twenty or thirty per cent less than what they were laid off at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's -- that's really hard to, um, accept that, you know [LAUGH]?
L:  But, see, I --
R:  That --
L:  -- I didn't see that.  So, see I'm -- I'm not on the same plane that you are.
R:  Well, you probably -- yeah, I wouldn't say that [LAUGH].  But, um --
L:  What -- what I'm -- what I'm talking about is for the work that we do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- when we work, I think seven dollars an hour is ...
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  You know?
R:  I'm sure for the -- the wor- --
L:  Because around here they expect you to really bust your butt.
R:  Right.  That's a -- 
L:  And, uh --
R:  -- that's a lot of physical --
L:  -- yeah.  Oh, a --
R:  -- pressure.
L:  -- lot of physical, a lot.
R:  Mhm.  And do they have good safety standards to -- to -- at the same time, or do they have low safety standards and healthcare, um --
L:  Um --
R:  -- you know?
L:  [COUGH] 
R:  Is it standar- -- you know, is, like, what I'm --
L:  Safety standards?  I wouldn't think so, considering when we were trained, that they could just shove right by us and go by us whenever they wanted to and, uh, up and over our head or whatever, and we'd tote -- you know ...  No, I wouldn't think so.  Um, what I was trained on.
R:  Yeah, because I just -- I mean --
L:  Then you have to -- sometimes you have to stand up on the line or to reach a product on the top shelf --
R:  Right.
L:  So, no.
R:  I've --
L:  I wouldn't say that.
R:  -- never worked in, uh, in any kind of, um, factory or warehouse conditions since I was a student, but even then I recall that it seemed, like, very, um [LIPSMACK], kind of low safety standards where I was working, you know?
L:  Well, what they -- what they do is -- is, uh, they put you on a quota.  You have to make so many pieces within an hour --
R:  Per hour, yeah.
L:  -- and then everybody gets hyperactive and rushing around and ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, no, safety standards are not always looked at.
R:  Not a big prim- -- um, priority.
L:  I mean, they drop product on the floor, they leave --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- boxes hanging out, you know?
R:  Well, it's a good thing you don't work in the chicken factory.  I saw that documentary about them [LAUGH] dropping chickens --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- in the [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, no kidding.
R:  Oh, yes, it was a -- it was a huge thing.  It was on Sixty Minutes years ago, one of those shows, and it was just a huge -- caused a huge commotion that, you know, that was conditions where it was, like, minimum wage at the time, somewhere in the south.  And I mean, I do mean minimum.  Like probably three something an hour and, um --
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  -- people were dropping, um, you know, chickens on -- poultry on the floor after they defeathered them or whatever, and then just picking them up off the floor and putting them back on the convey- conveyor belt.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, [LAUGH] you didn't wanna go -- you didn't --
