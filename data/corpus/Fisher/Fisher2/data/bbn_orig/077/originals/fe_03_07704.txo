R:  Hi, I'm Anna.
L:  Hi, Anna.  Lee.
R:  Hi, Lee.
L:  How are ya?
R:  Fine.  How are you today?
L:  Good.  Where ya calling from?
R:  Oregon.  What about you?
L:  New York.
R:  New York?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I guess we're at opposite ends of the spectrum, huh?
R:  Just about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Almost exactly, yeah.
L:  Did you, uh -- are here from Freelance?
R:  Yes, I am.
L:  Uh, so am I.
R:  That's so funny.
L:  Yep.  Yesterday I met a woman from, uh -- and I wish I got the name -- Rebates for -- for Me, or Rebates for Free.
R:  I don't know, but if you go to Google dot com and type in both of those names you're bound to come up with something.
L:  You think so?  I did a search on I. one.  I couldn't find anything.
R:  Do it -- Google has everything I swear.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I find so much on there.
L:  Yeah.  How long have you been a member of, uh, Free- ...?
R:  Of Freelancer?
L:  I know we're supposed to talk about something else, but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  For about two and a half years I think.
L:  [MN] Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, even before she made her big T.V. thing, huh?
R:  So, that was when I saw -- when she went on the Today Show that was when ...
L:  Oh, it's been that long?
R:  No, I don't think it has.  Maybe a year and a half.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  Has it been that long?
L:  I don't know, but I get a lotta --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- a lotta good deals off it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, I get all kinds of free stuff and I've won, um, ten dollars here and there.
L:  I know.
R:  We better talk about the topic though.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  So, you know what I look -- I look for money.  No, I'm just kidding.  [NOISE]  Um, you wanna go ahead?
R:  Well, I would say ...
L:  Are -- are you single or ...?
R:  I'm single right now.  But I would say that what I would look for is respect because that encompasses a lotta things.
L:  Right.
R:  If someone has respect for themselves --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they'll have respect for you.  Respect encompasses honesty and, um, consideration and just so many different things.
L:  Right.  Well, I'm married.  So, I, um -- I actually think I've found, uh [LIPSMACK], basically, you know, the perfect man wrapped up in -- in one.  I mean, he -- he has all the great qualities that anybody could ever ask for.  So, I've been very blessed that way.  He's respectful and, um, considerate and very sensitive and he's, um [LIPSMACK], very unselfish and I don't mean in a monetary sense.  I mean in a giving sense, you know?  He gives time and energy and -- and those kinda things I -- I feel are so important, especially -- we have three little kids.  So, you know, it's a good partnership.  So, um, he was everything that I -- I was looking for and I found him.  So, that was -- that was so good after, you know, ten years of the wrong men in my life [LAUGH] and, uh, I'm -- I'm very pleased.
R:  Does he have a good sense of humor 'cause that's important too?
L:  He has a great sense of humor.
R:  Don't you think that's so important?
L:  Oh, my God!  You know what?  I -- well, that was like one of the biggest things that attracted me to him and he has a big nose, which I always really liked.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I, uh [LIPSMACK] -- yeah, it's -- and, you know what, it just -- I don't know -- it keeps us going through hard times.  It's -- he's very funny.
R:  You say that -- you say he has a big nose and I say this jokingly --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but when we were teenagers we read somewhere that you can tell the size of the hose by the size of ...
L:  [LAUGH] Hands and feet too I've heard.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  But it's always been one of my things, like crooked noses or something unusual.  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that one caught my eye.  So, yeah -- so, yeah, I've been lucky that way.
R:  Well ...
L:  Hopefully, you know, your -- your life partner will come along as well.
R:  I believe there's someone out there for me and I just haven't met him yet.
L:  Well, do you live like in a small ...?  See, I live in Brooklyn, New York.  I'm in New York City basically, you know?  So, I mean, there's three zillion people here and my Mom is single and she lives in this, you know, really small town and it's so impossible for her to meet anybody.  Do you ...?
R:  Well, I live in -- in Eugene, Oregon, which is the second biggest --
L:  Right.
R:  -- city in Oregon, which is only -- not that much compared to you guys -- a hundred and fifty thousand people.
L:  Right.
R:  There's some small communities around here, but there is a shortage of men.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The economy is really bad here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I've been on unemployment for nine outta the last twelve months --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and --
L:  Things are much better here I tell ya.
R:  -- it's just horrid because the kinds of things that I do are like going camping types of things and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not -- for one thing I don't drink.
L:  Right.  I don't drink either.
R:  So, I don't go to the kinds of place where you would meet a lotta people, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  When I do go out I go to the movies or I go to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- dinner with my friends.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm not going to school and I'm not working --
L:  I know.  I know.  See, that's it.
R:  -- and so there's no networking, there's no place to meet anyone.
L:  I know.  [LIPSMACK]  Hmm.  I wish I had ideas for you.
R:  How 'bout your husband, does he have a brother?
L:  [LAUGH] He does.  He's married, but you wouldn't want him anyway, totally different breed.  I don't know.
R:  Nephew?
L:  [LAUGH] No.
R:  Old son?
L:  Fifteen.
R:  Grandfather?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Anything?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what about a personal?  But don't do it over -- well, I don't know.  I -- I've just had a friend, um, who actually met a man over, um -- it's called J. Date.  It's a -- a Jewish dating service and she really liked him and she actually moved to Arizona to be with him, though it didn't work out, um, but he wasn't crazy or any of these ...  You know?  Um, he was a really good stand up guy.  But, uh, you know, they -- they realized it wasn't meant to be.  But, you know, she's still living there and likes it.  Have you ever thought of doing that?
R:  Well, uh, I have an ad on Cupid dot com.  You can look at it if you'd like.
L:  Really?
R:  If you put in -- if you put in that you're looking for a forty one year old woman from, um, zip code nine seven -- I think I put in nine seven -- because I have a different P.O. box -- nine seven four seven seven --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- then my picture will come up and I think that --
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  -- I think it's Brandy Rose that I put on.  But I --
L:  Have you --
R:  -- no one's ...
L:  -- gotten any responses?
R:  No.  It's only been on for about a week.
L:  Okay, good.
R:  But then there's been times in the past when I did those and, um, I either get one of two things, either everyone in your area writes to you and there's --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- a lotta them are just looking for sexual --
L:  Right.
R:  connections --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I'm not looking for that at all --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and like, um, one of the guys that answered my last one was such a loser.
L:  [MN]
R:  He like had this web page where -- and God forbid, I know no one's perfect, but when you're going on a computer and you have misspellings there's --
L:  I know.  Right.
R:  -- spell check and there's all this, you know?
L:  I know.  That says a lot, doesn't it?
R:  Yes.  And he had this story about how he used to be married to this woman and his teenage son was in jail for sexually abusing her daughter.
L:  Okay.  Well [LAUGH], you know, right there ...
R:  But that -- oh, oh, that's not even the -- the -- the -- the main thing is that he was saying well, they were just two teenagers experimenting with each other so he wasn't taking any kinda responsibility --
L:  Oh, God!
R:  -- and I was like yes, if this is the kinda person that I'm gonna meet then ...
L:  Right.
R:  You know?  But that was about two years ago.  So, I thought it would be a good idea and I put it on Cupid dot com and ...
L:  I -- I don't know that.  I -- I mean, I've heard of Match dot com and, um, a couple of them, but I don't even know, you know, what kinda success people have and ...  I mean, listen, I know so many people that are looking for somebody else, you know?  Unfortunately more women than men 'cause, you know, there's a male -- a male shortage everywhere I think.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I -- you know?
R:  Plus around here there's a lot of gay men.  I have a lotta --
L:  Really?
R:  -- close friends -- some of my close friends are gay men and they even say that, um, a lotta straight men have been going to the, um, gay bars lately and just experimenting and stuff.
L:  Really?
R:  I don't know what's going on.  But, um ...
L:  Interesting.
R:  There's a ...
L:  See, I mean, I've heard of that here too, you know?  But we're in such a major, major city.  That's interesting.  Hmm.  Well, you will -- I mean, when you -- are you planning on going back to work?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I've -- I've been looking for work.  Actually I had a promising job interview this morning.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  But, um, there's like a hundred and fifty thousand people in Oregon looking for jobs right now --
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  -- and I don't have any specialized field.  I basically -- I've raised a son and worked, um, part time, like several part time jobs at a time, or a fulltime job and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a part time job and they've all been like menial customer service type --
L:  Right.
R:  -- jobs where when you go from one to the other you just start at the bottom again.  So, I don't have any specialized skills or anything like that.
L:  What about going back to school?
R:  Well, I have a two year degree in community service.  I thought it would help me get into social services and it didn't help me and now I still owe my student loans and so --
L:  Right.  I know.  I know.
R:  -- that's as far ...
L:  I've been in the same boat.
R:  It's just hard because when you're alone it like creates all these other emotional and psychological and financial issues.  So, it would help if you had a partner, you know what I mean?
L:  Right.  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, well, you know, I mean, give the job thing a little time, but maybe if it doesn't happen -- I mean, sometimes -- you know, first of all if you go back to school your student loan will on default -- not default, it'll be -- you don't have to pay it.
R:  Deferred, yes.
L:  Deferred.  And then a lotta times colleges have work study programs.  You could work there part time at least or -- I mean, I don't know what kinda money you need right now.  I mean, there's plenty of administrative jobs and all sorts of stuff at the college.
R:  See, the other thing is, uh, we have great -- our state is going through cut backs and because I don't -- I -- I am my bread winner --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I always have to have money --
