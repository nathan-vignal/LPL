L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Eleanor.
R:  Hi, Eleanor, I'm Karen, I'm calling --
L:  Hi, Karen.
R:  Hi, I'm calling --
L:  Nice to talk to you.
R:  -- calling from Michigan.
L:  Oh, I'm in Tuscon, Arizona.
R:  Oh.
L:  We're in the middle of some wild fires out here but we're surviving. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh no.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah.  So, our topic for today was ...?
R:  Comedy.  And --
L:  Comedy.
R:  -- um, how to draw the line between I guess good and bad.
L:  Oh, and acceptable and unacceptable.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  What are your -- what's your opinion?
R:  [SIGH] [LAUGH] Well, I thought it was gonna be just comedy and then after the recording came on it said, you know, between acceptable and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and unacceptable.  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess that depends upon the person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What may be acceptable to me may not be acceptable to you or --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- what may be acceptable to a male might not be acceptable to a female.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, sometimes men can put, um, you know, like, tell jokes and, um, in a derogatory way and it's not acceptable for female, whereas the guys think it's all funny, you know?
L:  Mhm.  I think also it -- it probably has to do something with the context, um, in which something is brought up.
R:  Exactly.
L:  If it's just a comedy like ... if you're gonna into a stand up routine you know you're -- you're in for comedy and also be [inaudible] or whatever, but if -- in terms of telling stories or bringing up something, [SIGH] it's definitely a judgment call whether the people in the room are gonna be offended or not or, you know, if it just must be told and the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- unacceptable level of it is not as strong as the importance of relating the story [LAUGH] I guess.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Just so -- and then it's like, [SIGH] um, when a person's on the other end, you know, like if somebody's telling the story and it's supposed to be funny and you're in the story but you don't think it's funny --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- you know?  And it's like -- it's embarrassing or something, it's like, how do you react or how do you respond to it, you know?
L:  Absolutely, 'cause I think -- personally I tend -- it's +really difficult for me to be embarrassed and then -- but then it's easy to assume that other people feel the same way that I do, so ...
R:  Yeah, that's true.  +Yeah.
L:  People might be offended and you never know and you walk away happy as can be. [LAUGH];
R:  R- yeah, yeah.  I know.  People th- -- yeah, you know, everybody takes things differently, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- w- one person, you know, thinks it's so hilarious and so funny, the next person might think it's offensive, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I guess sometimes it's a judgment call.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Definitely.  That was -- it's funny that that -- that that was the question 'cause we were talking about that t- this morning.
R:  Oh.
L:  I was at a breakfast with a -- a bunch of girlfriends and it was actually a bridal shower brunch.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, and there were some games and activities and one of the games was to guess [LIPSMACK] -- it had to do with -- they ha- -- we had to tell a true embarrassing story.
R:  [inaudible].
L:  And -- and when I went to tell my story it -- it was a little bit inappropriate for the table --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it was -- had to be told for that moment. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was so funny.  So, um --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  -- I told everyone that it was going to be inappropriate but it had to be told and so I told it and [MN] everyone was just in tears laughing --
R:  Really?
L:  -- by the end of it.  But it was a true story so --
R:  Oh.
L:  And the -- the situation had called for it so [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But yeah.  So, it was funny because we were, you know, we were sitting at this prim and proper little brunch but --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes you have to break the rules and shake it up a little bit I think. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Mm mm, what else could be said about that topic?
R:  Oh boy, I don't know.  Um ... comedy.  What's unacceptable and what's acceptable?
L:  Well, I was actually thinking in terms of stand up comedy routines and things.  We were watching -- my boyfriend and I were watching an old Bill Cosby routine and it was hilarious.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And he didn't have any vulgar words it, he -- he wasn't talking about anything inappropriate and it was hysterical.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it seems that comedians nowadays tend to [LIPSMACK] rely more upon shock value [LIPSMACK] or more vulgar or sexually oriented material, um, in order to -- to make themselves stand out and just shock people into laughing I think.  But there are very few comedians that have good, clean, funny humor and I think it's just because in the cycles of innovation people are constantly trying to shock --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and surprise the audience --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and then that turns it into something a little bit less tasteful.
R:  That's very --
L:  But that's my opinion and I mean, it's like --
R:  That's very true though.
L:  -- that's my judgment, I don't know.
R:  That's very true.  I was just, um, thinking about the topic earlier today and I was thinking about, um, years ago there was a comedian called Red Skeleton.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he was so funny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, he was on TV and he -- and he was just hilarious and he w- -- you know, he didn't have to be vulgar or distasteful or -- but he was just absolutely fantastic and -- and it's like nowadays, like you said, the comedians are a lot different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, he's just absolutely fantastic.  It would be fun to watch some of his, um, some of his old -- old, you know, stand up comedy tapes.
L:  Yeah, it's probably -- it's refreshing in a way to go back to some of them.
R:  It is, absolutely.
L:  Except that was funnier then and it's -- it -- it -- I think it goes through a cycle and it becomes funnier again.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.
R:  And another one was, um, The Life of Riley.  That's was a really, really old one, that's probably about fifty something years ago and -- but again, that was [SIGH] very humorous and very, you know, all clean fun and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh, uh, you know, it was funny.  So -- but they didn't have to, you know, use the vulgarity to, um, make people laugh years ago.
L:  Right.
R:  So ... yeah.  Uh, I would very much like to see some of those tapes again.
L:  Yeah, that would be fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Rarity that you can find some of these old recycled things that come back on TV.
R:  Right, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  So, I -- I -- I noticed on, you know, even like, on TV there's a lot of, um, swearing and cussing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and it's unbelievable.  So --
L:  Shifted standards of what is acceptable and what's not.
R:  Right.
L:  But I feel like the standards have shifted so quickly in the last few years.  I mean, it hasn't been -- I am not that old but I mean, it seems that if -- we've seen a sharp increase of what you can see on TV, it doesn't really exclude anything at this point.
R:  Right.
L:  And sometimes it's not funny, what's considered comedy --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] the sitcoms and things, not even in terms of appropriate or not, but some of 'em are just not funny, they're really predictable jokes and, um, predictable follow up lines and the laugh tracks and --
R:  Mm, mm.
L:  -- tell you when to laugh so that you think it's funny.  But it's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's really not that funny and n- -- or entertaining, most of the time.
R:  I know, there's not too many programs on TV that are supposed to be comedy that I actually find, um, find funny.  Um, one of the programs I do like is, uh, um, Everybody Loves Raymond.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, that's, um -- to me that's very appropriate, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  That's interesting. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm actually though -- I'm fascinated by comedy and I'm fascinated by people who -- who can make other people laugh because it's not a very easy [NOISE] skill to be able to entertain routinely.  Um, and with all of the reality shows that they've been having lately they -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the newest one is The Last Comic Standing, I don't know if you've seen it?  But it's a --
R:  I heard about it but I -- I don't believe I've seen it.
L:  Yeah, I think it just started last week or --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- or some- -- I haven't followed it either but it's an interesting premise because it's -- it's just like the other reality shows in that everyone has a chance to be evaluated and somebody gets eliminated --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and goes to the next round.  And --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it's based on [LIPSMACK] -- it's more of a personality and a skill based reality show than all of these sort of scripted, the dating ones that I don't ever believe in the first place [LAUGH]!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, it's -- it's a sort of refreshing twist on the same old ... on the same old reality series TV that we've been seeing these last couple of seasons, so we'll see --
R:  Uh-huh[?].
L:  -- what happens with it, see if it takes off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I think that's an interesting standard to evaluate somebody on, is their ability to
