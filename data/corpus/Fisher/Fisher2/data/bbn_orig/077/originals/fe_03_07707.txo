R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Karen Neilson calling.
L:  Hi, this is Joanna Wolf.  I'm in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, I'm in -- in, uh, Michigan.
L:  Ah.
R:  So, I guess the topic is what is the most important thing to look for in a life partner.
L:  Yes.  Do you have any thoughts on that?
R:  Um [LAUGH], maybe a list a mile long.  Um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH], honesty I guess would be number one for me, um, and I think, um, somebody that would be easy to get along with would be very important too and maybe, um, things, you know, that you would have in common, you know, certain, um, hobbies, goals, whatever, and I guess values are -- would be really important too.  So what about you?  What -- what are your thoughts on the topic?
L:  Well, I -- I find it interesting that you say honesty is number one [LAUGH], although I -- I would -- I would kind of put that under the umbrella of values.  But it's -- it's -- I -- I -- with something like that it makes me think that there's something in your past [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where that's been really key.
R:  Yes.  Definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- that's very true.
L:  But, um, I -- I think -- I think about my sister quite a bit when, uh, she was going through her divorce and everyone -- everyone at her divorce support group except for her [LAUGH], um, all -- all of them were getting a divorce because of unfaithfulness, which is definitely coupled with honesty.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I -- I would say that -- that the same shared values of honesty and faithfulness, um, certainly come under one of the -- the key things that you look for in a life partner.
R:  Right.
L:  Although when -- when I was given the topic I think a sense of humor but, um ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, that -- that -- that's a good quality.
L:  That's a good quality.  That's just one of many.
R:  Right.
L:  I -- I also think, um [LIPSMACK] -- when I was in college, um, I took a sociology class and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I went to a small liberal arts college in Ohio and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that -- that they -- they had a -- they had a questionnaire that they started the class out with to try to get people's opinions and they went through a whole series of questions of would you be a friend with -- would you live next door -- would you let your daughter marry [LAUGH] sorta thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it was interesting that, you know, they -- they would have classifications of people and types of people and I think that you're very idealistic when you're younger, you know?  It shouldn't matter what the -- the person's race is or how much money they earn or the type of job that they have.  But as you grow older I think you become more practical I guess is -- is the only thing that comes to mind.  It isn't that you couldn't fall in love with and marry somebody who ...  One of the t- -- one of the identified people was somebody who was a -- you know, a -- a trash man or somebody who, you know, was a garbage man or something like that.  And isn't so much that you definitely didn't wanna marry someone who had that sort of career, but as you get older you realize well, if -- if I were -- that person probably doesn't share the same -- you know?  If -- if -- if that's what they're happy doing that's not necessarily going to share the same type of interest and -- and education level and goals that -- that the other person might have.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  That -- that -- that's very true.  I guess, um, that the interest, you know, would be probably different and I guess, you know, maybe you would be interested in going to the theater whereas with somebody that was a sanitation worker, you know, would have different interests, but -- in -- in general, you know, but maybe not.  But who knows?  I don't know.  Society's changing so much.
L:  You know, it -- it -- it is and -- and, you know ...?
R:  And with the job market people are losing their jobs and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- taking anything they can get.
L:  Yes, and -- and that factors into things as well --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because ...
R:  So, I guess you just -- you know, you just never know, um [LIPSMACK], but like, you know, when you meet somebody and you start dating they appear to be one way and then it seems like after you get to know 'em --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] after about three months then -- then the real ...
L:  The honesty comes out.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  And sometimes it doesn't take that long.
R:  Right.  And -- and it's like every put -- everybody puts on a -- a, um [LIPSMACK] -- a bet- -- you know, their best foot or, you know, presents themselves at their best at first, but then after you get to know that person they kinda let their guard down and then their true personality comes out, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's like you meet somebody and you date and you fall in love and get married, but then as -- you know, as time progresses people have a tendency to change too.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know?  Your interests can change and, um -- and, you know, you can change, the other person changes.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think then -- then one of those things that I would add to that list is somebody who has the ability to grow with you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not just grow apart from you.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  So ...
L:  I mean, it's -- it's -- it's interesting.  My parents have been married for over fifty years and ...
R:  Oh, wow!  Do they get along good?
L:  They get along great.  But every one of my brothers and sisters has gone through a divorce.  Some of them are on their second marriages.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  And -- and -- and I -- I've remained single.  So, it's -- it's very interesting to kind of figure, you know, what's acceptable or what's not acceptable --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and -- and so, you know, as -- as you get older I think you get pickier too.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.  Well, you know, my Grandpa and Grandma were married for I think sixty some years or seventy some years.  They passed away in their middle nineties and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they got -- they were married when they were in their early twenties.  But I tell ya, they didn't get along at all.  I mean [LAUGH], they fought like cats and dogs.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, talking about ...
L:  Was it healthy fighting or was it real antagonistic fighting?
R:  [MN]
L:  Because I -- I think arguments and fighting can be productive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- I think it's -- it's more worrisome the people who don't fight and don't argue because I think that, you know, you keep it inside.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's true.
L:  I don't know.
R:  But I said -- this topic I think I could go on talking all right about.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's an easy topic to -- to discuss.  Um, I don't know.  It -- it was really interesting to, um, observe people, couples and just -- you know, to see what makes that relationship tick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, some relationships, you -- you know, you look at them and you think that they're not gonna last, but they do, um ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know several that are in that category.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I was like gee, I never would've thought it and yet --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they -- they're there, they're still together after so many years and something must be keeping 'em together.
R:  Right.  Right.  So, you're single?
L:  I'm single.  Yes.
R:  Never been married, huh?  Well, I've been divorced for many years and, um -- I don't know -- I haven't dated in about three, four years and I really don't -- I don't know -- I really don't have a desire to so -- not anymore.
L:  Oh, I've -- I've reached old crone stage I think.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, there's all -- you know, there's all of the horizon --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there's always, you know, a possibility.
R:  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Pardon?
R:  Yes, I -- I agree with you definitely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um ...
L:  So, I -- I think it's difficult.  I think it's hard to find someone.  I -- I have a -- a friend who has -- is turning fifty this year and she is oh, you know, kinda hell bound and determined not to be alone --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- much longer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so she's -- she's taken stock of her life and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and making changes --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, it is interesting.  I had a friend -- when I was in my twenties I had a friend who was in her sixties who was single and she was very methodically going through various things to meet people --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- uh, and -- and, you know [SIGH], she joined Mensa and then realized [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- this is back to -- back to the sanitation work she -- she -- she joined Mensa and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and felt that all the men that she met basically, um, they -- they -- they basically were members of Mensa because they -- they didn't fulfil --
