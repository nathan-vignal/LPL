R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, my name is Robin.
R:  Hi, I'm Lydia. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, Lydia.  Um, actually this is my first time.  I don't know what to do [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Oh, well, it's only my second time.  Um, well I guess we're supposed to talk about the subject and we're supposed to try and stay only on that subject.
L:  Oh, about the [MN] --
R:  [NOISE] Minimum wage.
L:  -- five dollars and --
R:  [NOISE] Minimum wage.
L:  -- and minimum wage?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  
L:  Well, I believe the [MN] -- they should be ten dollars an hour [LAUGH].
R:  [NOISE] Oh, at least.
L:  Yeah.  I don't think that anybody can survive with six dollars an hour.
R:  [NOISE] What kinda work do you do?
L:  I work in a hotel --
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  -- um, here in Beverly Hills --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- in Los Angeles.  Um, over here, actually for hotel, they're paying in the twelve, thirteen dollars an hour.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, for --
R:  [NOISE] What do you do?
L:  Oh, just front desk.
R:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.
L:  Just, like, uh --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So that --
L:  -- the checking in, checking out.
R:  [NOISE] That's a higher paying job than, like a waitress or, um, bellboy, things like that.
L:  [MN] Oh, believe it or not, the -- the waitress and waiters over here in Ca- -- or at least here in Los Angeles, they make more money than me.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  They making, uh, at least twenty to twenty five dollars an hour.
R:  [NOISE] With tips though, right?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Especially if they work in a upscale place --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- like -- like a five diamonds place or something like that.  Make -- make hell ton of money, like two --
R:  [NOISE] Can I ask what -- what hotel you work at?
L:  The L'Hermitage.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  It's like one of the --
R:  [NOISE] That's a nice one, yeah.
L:  You know, where all the celebrities are staying.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, cool. [NOISE].
L:  So, [SIGH] yeah, they work there, um, um, so the waiters in my hotel, they make, um twenty five to three thousand a month.
R:  [NOISE] Oh my goodness --
L:  Yeah, just in tips --
R:  -- I have to move down there [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Where are you guys are?  Wh- where are you?
R:  [NOISE] I'm -- I'm in Seattle, Washington.  In --
L:  Oh, you're in Seattle.  How's the weather there?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, well today it's cloudy and -- and, uh, not so warm, but [SIGH] it's like one day it'll be [SIGH] really hot, the next day it'll be cold.  It's been weird.  But, um, our minimum wage is sev- -- uh, seven dollars an hour.
L:  Seven dollars an hour?  
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  I'm moving to Seattle [LAUGH].  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I believe the -- uh, there -- um [LIPSMACK], I hear, actually, it's a well paid.  The only thing in Seattle is the weather, and that's wh- -- a lotta reason why a lotta people doesn't move.
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  [SIGH] But I hear that if you can do computer system, it's -- it's like the best paid city in America.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, but see the thing is is that our economy has gone bad because, um, [NOISE] you know, Boeing is having difficulty and the economy is -- I mean, it's not dependent upon Boeing, but it is a big part of it.  And, um, so I don't know what our current place is, but I know a while back we were the -- like the number one state for unemployment.  I mean, like, we had the highest rate of unemployment, so --
L:  Really?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  So, like, I'm looking for a job right now and it's tough.
L:  [MN] Wow, I'm kinda surprised.  Seattle is, uh, because I thought it was southern California, like, with the highest rate of [SIGH] unemployment, because everybody want to move from this place.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, here everybody want -- from all over the country, people move here [SIGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and right now, the state of California has the third part of the population of the United States.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  This is how much people we have here.  [SIGH] So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of course, uh, with that amount of people, [SIGH] we have a lotta competition trying to find a job.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Like, uh, a lot.  And, uh, that's why they pay over here six seventy five an hour [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, fiv- -- like, uh, this machine say about five seventy five an hour?  That's ridiculous.  
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  Nobody can survive with that.  I'd --
R:  [NOISE] No.
L:  -- probably be better applying for unemployment before I [LAUGH] -- I worked for five seventy five.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Do you know?
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.  
L:  'Cause when unemployment you can get two -- two, three hundred per week, um, until you find a job.  I don't know how the unemployment --
R:  [NOISE] But you have to have enough hours in -- in yo- -- in the system before you can get unemployment.  Like, [NOISE] um, I haven't worked in a long time, so I -- I wouldn't be able to get unemployment. [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, really?  
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, you have to have, like, I don't know if it's different in each state, but I know the last time I applied, you had to have, like, mm, I -- a hundred and eighty hours, or so- -- no, it -- I don't remember.  It was quite a bit though.
L:  Like -- like an amount of hours before? [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE] No, not a hundred and eighty, that would only be ...
L:  Here the rule is --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- you can never be fired, or you can never be la- -- um, um, quit.
R:  [NOISE] Oh.
L:  You have to lay -- be lay off, by the --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- for the job.
R:  [NOISE] Well, that's dumb though.  I mean -- I mean, [NOISE] you know, then that -- nobody would get it, if you're -- if you can only be laid off [NOISE].
L:  That's right.  [LIPSMACK] Uh, yeah, because, um, like, September eleven, that was the only time in my whole life that I actually was with unemployment benefit --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I -- I was off on unemployment for, like, two months.  I got lucky a little bit.  I work, uh, right there, like in December.
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  Even though the economy really sucks at the time, uh, I been work --
R:  [NOISE] You mean you were in New York?
L:  -- two -- two months later.  But for three months I was totally struggling, like, really bad --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.  Huh.
L:  -- because, uh, the year before I didn't made enough money --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- [MN] um, so they go for the percentage of the money that you made the year before --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and they do only like a third part of the money that you made, and they divide that per week.  And then, it was like almost nothing.  I can barely even pay the rent with that.
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  I can barely even made it for the rent.  So, um, actually, [inaudible], like, five dollars an hour, yeah, exactly like the machine say, yeah, so that -- nobody can survive, because you wanna pay rent and have your food, uh, there's not enough money.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Not -- not these days -- probably ten years ago, you know? [LIPSMACK] 
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I know.
L:  And what do we do now?  We just wait for ten minutes?
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, gotta keep talking --
L:  All right.  And they cut it off, or ...?
R:  [NOISE] Uh, they'll come on and say, "You have thirty seconds to, uh, to wrap up the conversation". [NOISE] So yeah, we gotta keep talking. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, um, what -- another --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as a, uh, like, working for, uh -- the minimum wage?
R:  [NOISE] Well, I, um -- I mean, I -- I understand that the argument is is that, like, small businesses are having hard time because they have to pay all this unemployment insurance [NOISE] and -- into the system -- and I -- I can sympathize.  And I think maybe that the big companies should have to pay more if, you know, if -- if they don't already, but, um, you know, I think it's important.  Like right now in Washington, they're cutting back on unemployment.  [NOISE] They're, um -- they're saying that, um, people who are like seasonal workers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- won't be able to get unemployment.
L:  Oh, wow.  [SIGH] Ah, are you have a degree in an computer system, or ...?
R:  [NOISE] No.  
L:  Or hospitality or ...?
R:  [NOISE] I -- [LAUGH] I actually, um, well, I -- I worked for a few years and then I, um, was hit by a car, and so I was getting, like, disability money for a long time, and, um, I don't know -- no, I -- I got -- I've taken some classes, but I don't have a degree [NOISE].
L:  Okay.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's always, ah, something to do, I guess, in, um, based on the ex- experience and the resume you have before.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, probably you can do something, you know.  If you -- you can go, like, into internet cafe or something and, uh, and [MN] check jobs over the internet.  I find a lot of jobs --
R:  [NOISE] That's what I --
L:  -- over the internet.  One day --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- with here in my computer in my house --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- I did like a hundred and fifty applications, and I sent it --
R:  [NOISE] Oh my --
L:  -- everywhere.
R:  [NOISE] How can you do that?
L:  And, actually faster.  It's way faster.
R:  [NOISE] I know, but a hundred and fifty.  How did you do that?  
L:  Oh, because -- would you -- what do you do?  You do copies.
R:  [NOISE] I know, but it's like you gotta, um, u- usually when you go on a website you gotta fill out their application, and, you know --
L:  No, you start searching, you know what I mean?  For example, my theme is hotels.  So, I start going hotel by hotel, hotel by hotel --
