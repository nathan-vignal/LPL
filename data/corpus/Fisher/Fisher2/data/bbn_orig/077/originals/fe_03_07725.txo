R:  Hi, my name is Stephanie.
L:  Hi, Steph.  My name's Jane and I'm in, uh, Canada.  Are you in Canada?
R:  No, I'm actually in, uh, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
L:  Oh, are you?  I'm very close to Cambridge, Ontario.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  Yeah, very funny.  So, the minimum wage is the discussion here --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and, uh, gee, no, I don't think [LAUGH] five fifteen is very much money in this day and age to live on for anybody, even kids.
R:  Is there a minimum wage in Canada?
L:  Yes, there is and, you know, I, uh -- right now I don't quite know what it is.  I -- I know it's more than that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's not extremely more, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then our money is different too.
R:  Right.  I can understand that.
L:  Yeah.  We're doing a little bit better on our dollar, we're about twenty five -- oh, about twenty five cents or twenty five percent lower now than the American.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that's nice.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  In one way, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And in another way maybe not.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But oh, my goodness, five fifteen can't do much.
R:  I don't think it's sufficient either.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Um, I feel like if you do all the math and, you know, figure out how much can you earn in a day and then subtract out taxes --
L:  Oh, yeah, no kidding.
R:  -- it's pretty awful.
L:  And if there's no tips or anything else involved [LAUGH] what are you going to do, right?
R:  It's really -- really bad.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  And, uh, tips here too are -- they're -- you have to report them, they're taxable and -- and everything.  Are they there too?
R:  They are.  I think a lotta people don't report them --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- like waitresses and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  It's ...
R:  Um, I have a number of friends who are like waitresses in New York and they're like, you know, struggling to get by and, um --
L:  Oh, no kidding?
R:  -- so it's, you know, do you break the law or -- or not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to report your tips?
L:  Well, they get really dicey about it here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  There are even inspections going on, like the restaurant books will be inspected and this and that --
R:  Gosh!
L:  -- and the other thing.  So, there's no -- well, I'm sure there's something under the table [LAUGH] but, you know, it's getting less.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, they -- they can't count on that type of thing.
R:  Yeah.  And if -- I mean, if the minimum wage were higher than maybe people would feel a greater responsibility to report tips, but right now I just feel like people are, you know, trying to do what they can to get by.  So ...
L:  No kidding?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No kidding?  That would make for more honesty all the way across.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it takes so much money to go to school or anything else.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  All that work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then do you have hours too that you can only work so many hours in a day or anything like that?
R:  I think that they have the rules for the -- like children, child labor, but I think as an adult you can work as many as you want.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  You're not guaranteed overtime.  So, you know, if you have a -- a forty hour week I don't think you're always guaranteed overtime.
L:  Right.
R:  I think it depends on like what you do.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, we used to have better hours here, but now they opened it up -- I think you're -- I don't know how many hours you're allowed to work before you --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- go overtime.  It's mean.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Now, what do you think the benefits would be if -- if the minimum wage were to go up, like how would that -- would that mean that there would be like more unemployment because less people would -- you know, the -- the companies would be able to higher less people or -- I mean, what -- what are the downsides of having the minimum wage?  I'm -- I'm trying to think of the downsides.
L:  Yeah.  Um ...
R:  'Cause my gut reaction is just like, of course, they should pay people more. But there's always like another side of it that I don't always look at.
L:  But here I think what they are sorta doing too to prevent giving out more money, which that would be the reverse of, is they're putting people on contract and then they go on contract and they don't get any, uh, benefits.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they're always signing -- trying to find another option --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to keep it down so the person -- 'cause they're in a ...
R:  Another way around, like the letter of the law?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the employee still doesn't win.
R:  Mm.
L:  Do you get a lotta contracts there kinda thing?
R:  I don't ...
L:  I wonder if they've started doing that.
R:  There's -- there's some of that.  I mean, I -- I work as a -- as a consultant.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I happen to get a salary, but I know a lot of other consultants who do work on a contract basis --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the benefits really -- you know, they're still doing the exact same job that they were doing, but they -- they don't -- you know, the health insurance and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the vacation benefits --
L:  It's not there.
R:  -- the companies don't have to pay for it and it's really -- it seems to be like a company's market out there right now because there's so much unemployment and, I mean, so many of my friends are desperate for jobs that they'll take anything.
L:  Yep.  Yeah.  See, we're a little bit better.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Our employment's a little bit better here.  But, you know [LAUGH], we could be in the same boat in no time, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how things s- shift and change.  So, I imagine by putting up the wage they would still find some way [LAUGH] to get -- you know, to make sure the employee didn't get much more, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Maybe they'd charge some of them for uniforms or -- it just goes on and on, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What they -- they could do.  It's mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  And there's also questions like if you raise the minimum wage then are like landlords gonna, you know, raise their --
L:  The rent.
R:  -- rent just because they know that people have a little bit of extra money.  Like, there's no way to tell on like the domino effect I don't think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I could be wrong.  But it just seems like a huge problem and ...
L:  Yeah, the negotiation power.
R:  Yeah.  I wish --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that there was some way to tie, like the minimum wage to like a cost of a bucket of goods or something.  So, like I wish that there was a way to calculate, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- what's the average amount that someone has to like get on, you know, to --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- to get to live and then have that be the minimum wage.
L:  Now, you know they used to do it here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  According to a, um, uh, uh -- a shopping cart full of groceries.
R:  Oh.
L:  How much you could fill up with groceries in that cart --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- according to what you made.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I haven't seen that done in a while.  But that was interesting because- -- then, you know, it would help to keep the cost of the groceries down because the person couldn't get it anyway without going on to welfare --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or something like that.  Do you have all those kinds of benefits to supplement these low, uh, earners?
R:  There's definitely like welfare.  That I'm sure of because [LAUGH] I have friends who are on it, um, but I think that, um, they've -- they've started making the rules a lot tougher.
L:  Yep.
R:  My friends are in New York and so you can't just be on it indefinitely, like, you know, they kick you off of it after a while.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um, yeah, I've been lucky in that, yeah, I've -- I've never been on it and it's nice to know that it's there, but I'm also like learning [LAUGH] never to count on that because, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  I -- I don't know.
L:  But, see, there's a stigma attached.
R:  There -- is there?  Is there?
L:  Oh, a terrible stigma and then, of course, with the person [PAUSE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that -- that would be a stigma too.  I know my phone's ringing and I'm not answering it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Okay.  [LAUGH]  I thought our time was up and I was like boy, that went fast.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  There it goes again.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, it -- it is an important call, but we'll let that go.  This is like my minimum wage.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No joke.  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, I --
R:  'Cause here I think that there's less of a stigma.
L:  -- I wish it was a lot ...
R:  Maybe it's like in the cities it's less of a stigma because everybody -- like, once you start talking to other people you hear oh -- you know, oh, you're -- you're getting minimum wage or oh, not even minimum -- sorry, you're -- you're unemployment, and people are like yeah, like it's not -- I think it's less viewed as welfare and just viewed as like unemployment, but ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, everybody here feels sorry for anybody who's on minimum wage too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and ...
R:  How many people do you think are actually on minimum wage, like how -- how many people -- if -- if the minimum wage were raised would it really affect?
L:  Well, you know, it's -- it's a funny thing, but I think here they pay them just above the minimum rage --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- uh, wage, sorta thing and I think minimum wage -- I'm not guessing now -- I think it's something like six forty five and you'll see most jobs are earning ten dollars --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- an hour -- an hour.
R:  'Cause I'm embarrassed to say I don't know what minimum wage is 'cause I haven't, um -- I've been working for about three years in a salary position.  So ...
L:  So, like you don't really come across as many people on minimum wage then?
R:  [MN]
L:  Like I really come across a lotta people, although I don't know what the amount is.  [LAUGH]  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I know ...
L:  I know they're really out there a lot.
R:  I know that -- I know that when I go to the mall and things like that, I mean, people who work in retail they're gonna be on minimum wage generally.
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  I mean, not the managers 'cause they get, I guess, a little bit more.  Um, I think people like -- you know, any sort of service profession --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, the waitresses make even less.  I think they --
L:  Oh ...
R:  -- make like three dollars --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then they have to make it up in tips, um ...
L:  I understood that with American that -- that the -- the waitress really suffered, like she's really low.
R:  Yeah.  It's 'cause it's -- it's a lot below the minimum wage.  So ...
L:  And ...
R:  And I'm assuming that when they talk about, you know, raise the minimum wage, is that sufficient, that they're not including waitresses, that they're just --
L:  So, that's --
R:  -- including everyone else.
L:  -- that's even law, huh?  Like here I'm pretty sure there are -- waitresses have to get minimum.
R:  No, here it's -- the minimum is like three dollars and twenty six cents or something.
L:  [MN] That's not worth going to work.
R:  But the ex- -- but -- but the expectation is that they're gonna get tips.  Only the problem is like in some places either the tips are divided up between like the kitchen and the bus boys and everyone else --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, you know, if they have a bad day then they're kinda screwed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I had a sister who used at in I.H.O.P., which is International House of Pancakes --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and so as a new hire, you know, she worked there for a while and she didn't -- I mean, she had to pay for her uniform and she [LAUGH] literally made like three dollars --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- an hour.  So, by the time she paid the toll to get over the bridge and the gas --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- like [LAUGH] some days she made like, you know, five dollars --
L:  Oh, yeah, but ...
R:  -- and that was it and it was awful because she -- she just -- she ...  Yeah.
