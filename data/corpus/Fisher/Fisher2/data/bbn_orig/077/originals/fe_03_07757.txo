L:  Hello, my name's Matthew.
R:  Hey, Matthew, my name's Carol.  How are ya?
L:  I'm doing good [MN].
R:  Cool.  This is the first time I've talked to a guy.  It's always been women [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [MN]
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  I've only done it once, and I talked to a man from Minnesota.  Where are you from?
R:  I -- I'm in Los Angeles.  I'm not from here but I live here.
L:  Okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  I'm from Iowa.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  Well, relatively, kind of.
R:  Kind of, really?  Yeah, no, it's -- [MN] well, I -- I'm from New York and New Jersey originally, but --
L:  Okay, cool.
R:  -- I've lived in LA for a long time and [SIGH] any place that isn't crowded, congested and polluted sounds like a great place right now, so ...
L:  Yeah, it has its highlights, I suppose, so.
R:  Yeah, which'll be interesting about the five fifteen minimum.
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Because I think it probably goes a little longer a way in Iowa than it does in --
L:  Definitely.
R:  -- California [LAUGH].
L:  And it's still -- in Iowa it's not enough, I would say.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] It -- there's actually a [SIGH] -- a campaign, um, basically -- basically the Iowa Democratic Party is campaigning to, uh, raise the minimum wage.  And a lot of people [SIGH] say that'll just, you know, cause employers to spend more.  But there comes a point when -- I d- -- I don't know, I -- I really -- I'm [MN] -- I'm into the idea of a living wage.
R:  Oh, God yes.
L:  Yeah, b- -- I mean, it's the only thing that makes sense, and it's the only thing that's like [SIGH] -- I mean, in the -- maybe at -- initially the economy might, like, you know, be hurt, maybe, I don't know.  But in the long run, you know, i- it just helps, you know, people be able to afford healthcare, unless, you know, the government ends up providing it after this, uh, two thousand four election, which would be kinda nice but --
R:  Well, listen, you know, yeah -- i- i- if I'm getting your drift I'm decidedly on your team and I'm not real thrilled with our government right now [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [LAUGH], no I'm not either.  I'm actually, um, working -- I'm a volunteer with, uh, John Kerry's campaign for president here in Iowa.
R:  Oh, good for you.  I know we're getting off the subject now, but there's a organisation that I signed up for during the war called Move On --
L:  [MN] Move On dot org [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, and -- and I just got thinking, Kerry's a good guy, but I -- I'm starting as far left as I can and working towards center, so I just signed up to work for Howard Dean [LAUGH].
L:  Okay, yeah.
R:  But there you go, we're all on the same page here --
L:  Yeah, oh yeah, definitely.
R:  -- you know, and -- and I think Move On, I think they've got a really good idea about [LIPSMACK] taking a straw poll with all of us --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to see where the biggest support is and then put- putting all of us behind that person, which of course, you know, if we in fight we're in deep doo doo.
L:  Yeah, oh, I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- oh, it -- it's -- we're in a dire -- dire state.
R:  We're -- we're beyond doo doo now, and I -- I lived, uh, in -- in Europe for a while.  My family's European, um, they're German, but -- but they came here, like, sixty years ago.  But I was able to live in Ireland for a while, and [SIGH], you know, the -- and I was born in New York, I was raised in New Jersey, I've been living in LA, which can completely turn your head inside out, and, you know, there just are better ways.  And as a single person without children, and not owning real estate, I pay pretty darn high taxes and get a whole lot of nothing back for it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so I agree with you not only on the healthcare thing, 'cause I am now an uninsured American --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Oh, yeah.  My sister, who's forty three, and her partner who is in his late fifties, they just had a child a year ago and have no health insurance [SIGH] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and they live in Maine, and they make, you know, this much -- I'm pointing my fingers really small -- too much money to get any help from the state, yet they can't afford five hundred dollars a month for health insurance, you know?  And I'm an individual, and I'm -- I'm, you know, I'm in my early forties.  And my health insurance is -- would be something like three hundred and seventy dollars a month.  I -- you know?  I don't have it.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.
R:  Yeah, it -- it's -- [inaudible] yeah, it's -- it's --
L:  And it's --
R:  -- so obscene, it's incredible.  And coming back to the minimum wage thing, [SIGH] never mind health insurance, I know people who are making forty thousand dollars a year and can't afford health insurance, okay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, you know, I live in a place where the average one bedroom apartment's like nine hundred dollars a month.
L:  Oh.
R:  And you're living in a barrio.
L:  Wow.
R:  Mm, and --
L:  That's incredible, that's -- wow.
R:  It -- it is.  And -- and, I mean, I lived -- my apartment's cheaper, but I live in a slum right now, 'cause I ha- -- was forced out because they [MN], the Republicans -- the few -- the two Republicans in the California [LAUGH] legislature -- 'cause mostly they are Democrats --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [SIGH] put through a thing taking away change of tenancy rent control, and I won't bore you with all the details, but long and short, basically, landho- -- landlords witch hunted long term tenants such as myself out of places that they had been living in for fifteen years.  I was paying, I had a roommate, but still paid twelve hundred dollars a month [SIGH] -- got me out on a technicality like I mispaid my rent by twelve dollars.  Managed to -- because I was overseas working --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- twelve dollars.  I was evicted after fifteen years of tenancy 'cause I mispaid my rent by twelve dollars on a setup.  I wrote the check out wrong --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I was evicted by a court of law, and --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- they now get twenty four hundred a month for my apartment.
L:  That's, uh, wow.
R:  Very un American, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, oh -- th- that is.  It's --
R:  Yeah, so -- so the thing is -- and I --
L:  Motivation behind it, you know.
R:  -- and people are saying that I'm really lucky that I live in a tiny little one bedroom, in a barrio -- I'm starting to lose my liberalness very badly these days, um, you know, for that kind of money.  So, the point being that it doesn't probably matter whether it's Iowa or California, no one can live on five dollars and fifteen cents.
L:  Yeah, oh --
R:  I mean, I -- I live in a city where, you know, I'm trying to get temp work and we are so outta touch with [MN] the cost of living, which has skyrocketed in Los Angeles from bad to obscene in the last five years [SIGH], where at least in New York where it's always been expensive, if you get a temp job you're gonna make, you know, answering phones, fourteen or twelve or something dollars an hour.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  In Los Angeles, they offer those same jobs to an educated, you know, forty something year old hip person such as myself [SIGH], oh, eight to ten.  That's before taxes.  
L:  Wow --
R:  You can't --
L:  Yeah, that -- that's not gonna do you any --
R:  Right, right, so -- so -- so the point being that [SIGH] five dollars and fifteen cents as a national m- minimum wage -- I mean, I don't wanna be politically -- well, yes I do, I love being co- -- politically incorrect, but they probably pay some of our, um, brethren from south of the border a lot more than five dollars an hour cash to cut the lawns and do the gardening and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Like you -- oh, yeah.  
R:  -- et cetera.  You know, I mean the kids who work at McDonalds and Burger Jack or whatever --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, I think in California they're offering seven dollars an hour to work there.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  And to make it even crazier, my sister, the one without health insurance, she lives in a very [SIGH] kind of tourist area of Maine called Bar Harbour, where they only have business, you know, during the summer months with all the rich tourists.  [SIGH] And during -- then the rest of the time, there's, like, no outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- business at all.  [SIGH] She was telling me, and I --I'm ready to go there for the summer -- [LIPSMACK] that there's such competition they are paying people to -- thirteen dollars an hour to wash dishes --
L:  Really?
R:  -- in -- in hotels.
L:  Wow, yeah, I'm about to -- I --
R:  Let's go -- let's all go to Bar Harbour [LAUGH].  But there's nowhere to stay, 'cause, you know --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- the people rent so much stuff.  But, but back to the main subject.  What -- what is the minimum wage now in Iowa?  I can't --
L:  It's -- it's five fifteen.
R:  It is five fifteen?
L:  Yup.
R:  And is that -- is that now the national?
L:  I'm not -- I'm not sure, but I just know it's not enough.  But --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I can't believe that the national minimum would be under five fifteen.
L:  Yeah, oh, well, especially in -- where you live, you know.  In an urban area, like --
R:  Is -- is -- is -- is the minimum wage a -- I thought it was a federal thing, or is it a state by state?
L:  Well, I think -- I think there's a federal minimum, but then a state can adjust it as they wish, really.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause I -- I couldn't imagine anywhere in the -- in the entire country, no matter how remote and how rural, that anybody could live on five dollars an hour.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it just doesn't work.  I mean, especially, like, [MN] now that there's increasingly less competition, like, among corporations that really kinda run the economy --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- now with you -- you just aren't -- you aren't gonna get a low price on any -- you aren't -- I mean, you're not gonna get bargain prices any more unless the economy's crap.  I mean, and that's getting there, you know?
R:  It's getting there [NOISE].
L:  But they -- but still, at the same time, they don't even lower their prices all that much, you know?  I --
R:  But things like -- thing like food, [LIPSMACK] -- um, I -- I used to think that everything was so expensive in Ireland and I came back to [LIPSMACK] LA three years ago and I keep on going, "God, things are expensive here".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Not that they're that much cheaper there, but I always thought they were proportionately cheaper --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and if I -- you know, I've gotta go really shop, you know, I go to, like, little mexican markets for fruits and vegetables and we have a little chain of [MN] lower price nice foods called Trader Joes.  I go there, because at Trader Joes, for instance, I get, um, [LIPSMACK] a quart of milk for ninety nine cents.  But if I go to the big chain supermarket, which in California is called Ralph's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] one of the big fanciest -- well, you know, they aren't even the fanciest of all the supermarkets, but they're one of the biggest chains --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they charge a dollar sixty four for a quart of milk.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's -- wow.
R:  Yeah, so like I'm thinking, you know, if you're looking -- and, you know, most people aren't smart enough to shop around -- 
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Or you're --
R:  -- and unless you get --
L:  -- just getting some milk, you know, you don't --
R:  Right, but I mean th- the food prices are -- I'm -- I'm finding fairly outrageous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know how it is in Iowa.
L:  I -- well, I mean, especially like -- on something like milk, I mean, milk production I don't think changes all that much.  Whereas, like, you know, vegetable and fruit crops, you know, they can, you know -- prices can change because of, like, you know, ah, quality or availability, but --
R:  Right, or in California --
L:  -- [inaudible]
R:  -- where we grow it, you know --
L:  Yeah, what I me- -- 
R:  -- it's probably cheaper.
L:  -- I mean, when you're talking about milk, that's -- you know, makes a person pretty suspect about the price.
R:  Sure.  Or even like, you know, a box of -- [MN] I don't eat the stuff 'cause I -- I try to be relatively healthy, but, [SIGH] you know, a box of Kelloggs cornflakes or, you know, Cheerios or whatever.  I mean, if you ever looked -- I -- I don't have kids, but if you look, those -- those cereals -- I don't -- well, in California are, like, three or four dollars a box.
L:  Yeah, oh yeah.  Actually, I ate a -- I can eat a box of Kicks[?] like --
R:  [LAUGH] Shame on you.
L:  -- in like -- yeah, like --
R:  It's bad for ya.
L:  -- I can eat a box of Kicks in, like, two servings.  Like a big box, 'cause like, I mean, when I have cereal, I'm -- I have big bowls of cereal 'cause it's really --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  And, yeah, I mean, I'm done --
