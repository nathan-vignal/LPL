L:  Hi, I'm Chelsea.
R:  Hey, how are you?
L:  I'm good, how are you?
R:  Good thanks.  Have you done one of these before?
L:  I haven't done one in a long time.
R:  Yeah.  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  Couple of months.
R:  Um -- what?
L:  I said it's been a couple of months.
R:  Yeah, I know, I'm never around to get their call.
L:  Yeah.  So, humor.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What's acceptable and what's not.
R:  Yeah.  What do you think?
L:  Um, I would say like, the -- the racial jokes, the sexual jokes, I mean, you gotta use them in the right content.  I mean, when -- if you're with your friends that's cool but, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Like, yeah, and I mean, definitely, and who else is around I guess too, like --
L:  Right.  Little kids don't --
R:  -- I mean --
L:  -- don't talk about bad things. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I know.  I have this one friend and like, every time we're in some restaurant or something she's always like, saying like, all this stuff and it's like, so loud and you're like, "Oh funny but cool --"
L:  Shut up, huh.
R:  "-- why don't you be quiet right now thanks?"
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but other than that, I don't know.  I think -- I think personally I'm pretty like, accepting of everything, um, I don't know, I guess, I don't know, I don't know where I draw the line because like, I guess if one of my guy friends was saying something that might piss me off but then you'll all go and listen to like, Eminem or something and think it's like, great or whatever, so I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess I have two sort of standards for it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I guess the only r- like, reason I would draw the line would be either around children or like, older adults like your parents or like, grandparents age and stuff, you know?
R:  Yeah, definitely[?].
L:  I mean, it's cool if you're like, in a bar that everyone is your age but it's not when there's little six year olds running around and you're just, you know?
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Yeah, I've got a friend who, we go eat and everything and she ju- I mean, just cuss like it's nothing like, even if we're in the -- like, parents and little kids around and I'm like, "We look like the stupidest little college kids ever". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I was like, "Golly".
R:  I know.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Where do you guys go?
L:  Um, I live in Dallas.
R:  Oh cool.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  I live in DC.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  Um --
L:  I've a --
R:  What?
L:  I have a friend who has a sister who lives in DC and goes to school up there.
R:  [inaudible], where does she go?
L:  Um, I think like, Arlington.
R:  Hm.
L:  Maybe.
R:  Cool.
L:  Or [inaudible] something, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Awesome.
L:  Her name's Brittany Smith, I don't know if you might know her?
R:  [LAUGH] No.
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  But it's a small place up here, it's funny like, everyone sorta knows each other.  Like, everyone has like, friends in common I guess is what it is.
L:  Really?
R: Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Um, let's see.  Okay, these topics like, really -- I never know what to say about 'em.
L:  I know.
R:  Um [LAUGH] -- um, hm, I think if I can think of an example of something.  Oh, I guess at work too like -- like, I don't know, at my work we've had to do all this like, harassment training and stuff lately.  I'm like, I don't know, I guess that's like the big thing with this whole issue is like, where do you draw the line with, um, making a joke or something?  Like, there's this guy, um, at work and he's like, Asian or whatever.  I'm like -- but he's got this like, great sense of humor and like, you know, he's really easygoing so we always like, tease him and stuff like, if we go out to happy hour we're like, "Oh, like, I guess Stan's gonna get drunk really fast or something" you know?  And like, you know, whatever, like, he thinks it's really funny, but like, some people in the office are like, "Oh my God, like, you said that?" you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.  I mean --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  I guess that's weird like, because I guess when you work like, people are from all different kinds of like, backgrounds and like, ages and everything and so ...
L:  Yeah.  It's also like, a professional environment, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, a- at my work -- I mean, it's -- my work is very laid back but, um, he was like, you know, "I'm gonna head out, I'm gonna make like a weed -- make like a tree and leave" you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Funny ha ha.  Well one of the girls that we work with, she was like, "Well, make like a fetus and head out".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And like, he's an older man and he j- -- his mouth just dropped and was like, "What did you just say?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Did you say what I think you said?"  It was like, okay, that was not appropriate". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, fetus jokes with the old guys, not good. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  That's funny though, I've never heard that.  Um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah, it's definitely like, the old people, like, don't get anything.  Like, I don't know, one day I was in the kitchen a- that we have at work, and like, um, I was talking to this guy and we were talking like, Snoop Dog.  We were like, "Oh, like, fresh is a little, you know" I go, "Oh, that's tough" and he was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just like, thought we were like, the biggest idiots he had ever seen.  He was like, "Is that like, some kind of code or something?"  I'm like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- "No, dude" [LAUGH], get a life.
L:  Yeah.  Nowadays it's kinda hard though 'cause you can't tell who's gonna get offended by what.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And some people are so finicky sometimes they'll get offended and other times they won't like, my -- my roommate --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is dating a [inaudible] guy and all the time he'll be like, "Yeah, I'm just a spic" or, "I'm just a wetback" or "Blah blah blah" but if somebody else says it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like, "Whoa, dude".  Like, we can call him, "Hey, you stupid spic" and he won't -- he won't care.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's like, no- nobody else knows when he's gonna flip out about it or not.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  You have to be like, really tentative about it or something, I know what you mean.
L:  Yeah.  Or tell like, Mexican jokes or black jokes, or even white jokes, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  And sex jokes too like, you know Sex and the City has like, come out the last season on Sunday or whatever?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I was watching on CNN there was this like, they were doing some discussion or something, some panel discussion, and like, there was this girl and she was on and she was like, "I just think that it's not funny to see these women like, you know, having sex with all these men, all the [several inaudible words], it's not reality" and like, everyone else was like, "Oh man, get over it, like, it's a great show, it's really funny, like, it doesn't --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- to be exactly like reality" and she was just taking it way too seriously I think.  Like, in terms of humor [several inaudible words] from marketing and stuff but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know.  I think you just gotta take these things like a grain of salt but like, I don't know, also just like, watch out for people who are gonna be offended by it, I guess, I don't know, especially if they're in a position that has an impact on you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, if I'm just like, walking down the street and I say something like, off color or something and someone hears it like, I would prefer that they didn't but if they do, I mean, whatever, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But if I'm at work I guess it's a different thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know, it's just so hard these days to even go there. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I mean, even blonde jokes people get anal about, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  "Not all blondes are stupid" and [inaudible] it's like, "It's just a joke, dude, chill out". [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know.  Yeah, and I mean, those are like -- like, you can't make a joke without pissing someone off like, it's sorta like, the point, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  So, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And [inaudible] --
L:  What did you say your name was, again?
R:  I'm Anne.
L:  Anne.
R:  Mhm.  Yep.  Um --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  Have you gotten paid for one of these yet?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, but it took like, two months.
R:  Really?  Okay, cool.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  I've only done one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is my second one.
R:  Waiting for my big old ten dollar check.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [SIGH] Oh well, I guess it's like, not that bad for the money.  I got one the other day, it was like, "Your topic is bioterrorism" and I was like, "Oh lord, I can't do this".
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  It was like, eleven o'clock on Friday night.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  [several inaudible words] and call that late? [NOISE]
R:  What?
L:  You could call that late?
R:  What?
L:  They call you that late?
R:  Oh yeah, yeah.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, during the week I guess, 'cause I --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- get off work at like, ten or something so that's when I put for them to call me.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  But ... anyhow, I wonder what they're doing with all of it? [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE] I don't know. [NOISE]  No idea. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [inaudible].  [SIGH] Oh man!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, there's only so much you can talk about though. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I know, and it's like --
L:  You know, once you say it what are you supposed to do?  Reiterate it? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know.  I guess so.  I mean, th- there's only --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- only so much you can talk about with
