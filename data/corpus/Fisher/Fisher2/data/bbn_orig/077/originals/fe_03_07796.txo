R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, this is Debra.
L:  Hi, this is Sally.
R:  Hi, nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you to.
R:  Oh, I don't like this topic very much.
L:  I don't really either.
R:  Well, it's too personal.  I mean, not personal, it's too situational.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  It's like, I think that's how you determine whether something's appropriate or not depending on who you're with.
L:  I think that's true.
R:  Like, I tell jokes that are in the worst taste, total --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- total racial, horrible, sexual -- not sexual in connotation but like, +misogynist or ...
L:  Right.
R:  -- with my boyfriend because we both know that it's a total joke and neither of us takes it seriously nor will we get offended but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I would never [LAUGH] tell that to like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- somebody that I didn't know or --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like, anybody that might take offence to it.
L:  I -- I think you're right.  I think it really is situational.  Um, like --
R:  [inaudible] no wa- -- I mean, it's -- that's almost so obvious I don't know where else to go with [LAUGH] --
L:  I -- I know what you mean.
R:  -- the conversation. [SIGH]
L:  Because, um, you know, like, I have kids that are twelve and fourteen.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you're like -- some of the stuff like, for example, uh, my daughter likes to watch [SIGH] -- it's on on Saturday night and I can't think of the name of it right now.
R:  Saturday Night Live?
L:  No, it's the other one.  It's kinda like Saturday Night Live.
R:  Like, Mad TV?
L:  Uh, [MN], um, yes.  And it seems like all the jokes have a sexual connotation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I hate it that she watches it.  And she doesn't understand why I get upset.  And I'm like, "Andy, why do you wanna watch this, it's all about sex?" you know, "You don't need to watch this".
R:  Yeah.  And she's too young.
L:  Right.
R:  Too they're -- too they're exposed to enough of that as it is, and to have the humor overtake that [NOISE] in that realm as well is --
L:  I know.
R:  -- going in the wrong direction. [NOISE]
L:  So in any case I think it's hard.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So you have [MN] -- you said you have two kids?
L:  Yeah.  My son's fourteen [COUGH] and my daughter's twelve.
R:  Does he like it too?
L:  Yeah, but he [LAUGH] he mainly always has Cartoon Network on --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- when he's home. [LAUGH]  He's not really --
R:  See, that's better.
L:  Yeah.  So, I mean, it's weird that he wants to watch it but he's not really paying attention to it that much but that's what he always wants to have one.
R:  Uh-huh.  How did you hear about this study?
L:  Um, I heard about it through money a- -- money and shopping dot com.
R:  Oh.
L:  How about you?
R:  Oh, I just read it in the newspaper and I thought it sounded like something interesting.  Where do you live?
L:  [MN] I live in Toledo, Ohio.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  Where do you live?
R:  In Manhattan.
L:  Neat.
R:  [SIGH] It's pouring.
L:  I know, I think this is definitely the worst topic they've given us.
R:  Oh, well, this is only the second time I've done it, and so the first one was relationships and this one's --
L:  Relationships?
R:  -- comedy but ...
L:  This is my third.
R:  I don't know, it definitely -- like, it bothers me when I see it on TV.  That --
L:  Right.
R:  That that kind of humor is on regular network --
L:  Right.
R:  -- all access TV, it drives me crazy because, I mean, I don't like it when T. shirts have swear words and people wear them outside.  I'm like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that is not -- because it might be funny for you and your friends ...
L:  But what about the rest of us?  Yeah.
R:  But what about their kids?  And like, yeah, other people that don't find that funny?  And [MN] --
L:  I n- know, it's -- I saw this guy riding a motorcycle today and he had on a T. shirt and it said on the back of it, "If you can read this the bitch the fell off" and I thought, "How rude".
R:  If you can what?
L:  "If you can read this the bitch fell off".
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I thought, that is so --
R:  I hate stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  I thought, that is so rude and obnoxious.
R:  'Cause it's -- it's like, there are other ways to say it and make the same joke.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And have it not be vulgar.
L:  And I mean, I cuss myself but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just -- I didn't think it was appropriate. [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Because it's like just what we were saying, it's like, you can cuss to people where you know that they're not gonna take offence to it but if -- if everybody's reading that T. shirt you can't filter it and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- then -- it just -- and it's cyclic because when people hear it they repeat it, if kids get used to seeing like, whatever bad words are written on T. shirts or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- hear nasty jokes all the time they'll think that's acceptable and ones that have like, either racist connotations or, um, like, uh, what do you call it when -- demeaning to women or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- demeaning to anybody, um, even if they know -- they know in their like, minds, that it's a joke --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just the exposure to that.  It -- you can't not influence how you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- behave.
L:  But especially for kids, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kids aren't supposed --
R:  I mean, that's basically what it is because --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- as adults and, well, and when you're among people that you know it's okay.
L:  Right, right.
R:  But it's like, if you're in a group of friends and somebody doesn't know you and you tell an off color joke like, and that's their first impression of you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- how do they know that you're not being serious?
L:  Right.
R:  Even partially serious.
L:  That's -- that's true.
R:  In today's age, like, people take umbrage at such m- inconsequential things like, people get so irate over seemingly meaningless or harmless --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things.
L:  Right. [COUGH]
R:  That if you make an intentional joke --
L:  I know.  My son is going through this phase right now where he likes to [LIPSMACK] make little racial slurs that he thinks he's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- being funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, we have a black cat and he'll call her Nigger or he'll call me --
R:  Right.
L:  -- cracker and I'm like, "T.J. don't talk like that because somebody else is gonna think you're really like that".
R:  Yeah.  Well it --
L:  And --
R:  -- drives me crazy that black call --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- each other that.
L:  I know.
R:  And --
L:  I don't like it either.
R:  -- I'm -- it's the same like, [MN] girls, "You bitch" but just a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- joke.  I'm like, "It's not funny".
L:  No, it's not.
R:  Unless you really mean it. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  I agree.
R:  But I -- 'cause if I would say that to somebody it's no longer funny.
L:  Right.
R:  But, then again I call my boyfriend a spic all the time because he's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- half Peruvian. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just like -- but it's like, it's in fun.
L:  Right.
R:  It's --
L:  And he knows that.
R:  If you know -- you know what -- who you're dealing with.
L:  Right.
R:  And that it's a joke.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  I -- there's no -- there's no way to like, really grade it black and white what is and isn't appropriate because it's mostly really just dealing with the audience that you're dealing with.
L:  That's very true.
R:  [SIGH] So, I don't know how much longer we have to go on this conversation.  Um, let's see.  [LIPSMACK] I hate the people that stand on the street corner and say, "Hey, do you like comedy?" but they probably don't do that in Toledo, Ohio.
L:  No, they don't. [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Have you ever been to New York?
L:  No I haven't.  I'd love to go there someday --
R:  Uh. [SIGH]
L:  -- to see it.
R:  There's, um, it's a promotion usually to get people to go to comedy clubs.
L:  Oh really?
R:  And they're like, "Do you like stand up comedy?" and -- or, "Do you like comedy?"  I'm like, "Who doesn't like comedy?"
L:  Right.
R:  It's such a dumb question, so I always try to come up with some snappy answer --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like, "Yeah, I'm -- actually I'm comedic and I'm standing up right now so I guess --"
L:  [COUGH] [inaudible].
R:  "-- I do it on my own and I don't need to buy your ticket, thanks". [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] That's funny. [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH] I'm like, "No, I don't like --"
L:  [COUGH]
R:  "-- I only like sit down comedy".
L:  Mm.
R:  Do you have a cold?
L:  I've had this bronchitis thing --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that's lingering.
R:  I'm glad that's not catching through this --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- phone! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  I can't afford to get sick right now. [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE] What do you do for a living?
R:  I'm a model.
L:  Are you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How cool.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's -- I like the work, it's always getting work that's more the difficulty in my field --
L:  I bet.
R:  -- but --
L:  Yeah.  A lotta competition probably.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, every -- every occupation has its downfalls.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  People always --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ask me if I wanna be an actress and I'm --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- like, "No, I'd rather do stand up". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I wouldn't really wanna do stand up.
L:  Right.
R:  But --
L:  But it's a better alternative.
R:  It would be a better alternative, 'cause everybody just immediately assumes that every model --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is just a wanna be actress, which is --
L:  Right.
R:  -- not the case at all.
L:  No.
R:  At least not in mine, I'm the one [SIGH] exception to the rule maybe --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but -- what do you do?
L:  I'm a medical transcriptionist, which means I type reports up for hospitals --
R:  Oh wow.
L:  -- about patients.  And I like --
R:  Is that a highly liable su- -- or occupation?
L:  Not really.  It is nice because I get to work at home.
R:  Oh, that is nice.
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible] I enjoy that part of it.
R:  Yeah.  I'm in school too.
L:  Are ya?
R:  So I'm actually --
L:  So you're pretty --
R:  This is my little study break, I have to write a paper on James Joyce.
L:  Oh yeah?
R:  Yeah.  That's due on Monday --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I haven't even started it yet, that's comedy! [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it's funny.
R:  [SIGH] That's not comedy! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That means all day t- --
L:  I know.
R:  I'm glad it's raining here because I'm gonna have to --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- sit inside and write a paper anyways.
L:  No.  Hopefully it doesn't have to be too long either.
R:  Four pages.
L:  Mm.  [SIGH] Y- --
R:  Not too long but long enough.
L:  Right.  Do you get to travel a lot with your modeling?
R:  Um, I've lived in Milan and Paris.  And --
L:  Cool.
R:  -- I was all over in Europe.  I mean, I've been in New York for two years and I've been pretty much here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I just got -- I was in -- last month I went to Ecuador for a job.
L:  Ooh.
R:  So, yeah, I mean, [SIGH] at this point --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where I'm at right now, it's like travel is kinda optional.
L:  Yeah, and especially if you're in school too.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  You don't wanna just take off.
R:  Right.  Tuition's too expensive.
L:  Well that's -- right.
R:  And I wanna finish.
L:  Well th- --
R:  And since I can't take a full load it's gonna take a extremely long period of time but [SIGH] ...
L:  What are you studying?
R:  Um, I just getting my bachelor -- bachelor's degree in liberal arts.
L:  Okay.
R:  I have a psychology concentration but it's not a major.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's just sort of a focus.
L:  I was always interested in that.
R:  It is, I mean --
L:  Then I got married and had kids and you know how that is! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  I know, I could probably --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- use them for some studies.  I'm more interested in
