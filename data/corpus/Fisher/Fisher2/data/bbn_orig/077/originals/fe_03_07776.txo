L:  Hello?
R:  [MN] Hello.
L:  Hey. 
R:  Hi, this is James from Atlanta [NOISE].
L:  Kevin from Jersey.
R:  Where -- [NOISE]
L:  What's up?
R:  Y- -- should I -- you heard, uh, the topic?
L:  Yeah, I don't know, comedy, where you draw the line before it's bad taste or something.
R:  [NOISE] Something -- I don't know.  'Cause to me, [NOISE] if it's comedy it's supposed to be funny, it's like nothing really [SIGH] that you can draw the line at, unless it's --
L:  Yeah, it depends --
R:  -- just totally offensive, like, purposely being offensive toward the individual, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  If it's like that, then it's like, okay, [NOISE] it was trying to disrespect me, so it's different. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] But, otherwise, if you're just chilling [several inaudible words] with your friends and they're trying to, like, make you laugh [SIGH], they can say something that someone else would consider gross but it's like -- I mean, it's just to be funny, that's the whole point [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, I -- I don- -- with comedy, I don't think you really can draw a line, 'cause everybody -- I mean, everybody has a different opinion on it, you know?
R:  Exactly [NOISE].
L:  [SIGH] Something that could be as funny as hell to me, it could be stupid as hell to somebody else [SIGH].
R:  Do you know what I'm saying? [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's all about who could relate to it.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  That's -- that's why comedy is so [SIGH] -- I don't know why people talk so much shit on it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- how it offends so many people. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I mean --
L:  Like fat jokes and, you know, racial jokes and all that shit.  It -- I mean, it's just, you know, funny sometimes, and sometimes, you know, if it's towards me maybe I'll hate it, but for the most part --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- it's funny, even if I don't like it.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, [several inaudible words] a lotta times, but it's funny because there's some kinda truth in it, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  Even if it -- if it's dealing with, like, um [LIPSMACK], shit, body issues, or, you know what I'm saying, stereotypes, whatever --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot of times there's actually some kinda truth in there, and that's what make you -- when people say it, it's like, "Oh, it's offensive" but they're like, "Well, yeah, sometimes, you know, I have noticed that" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] It's crazy but -- then again, I think that media do push the edge on comedy 'cause that's what keep it growing, 'cause if people keep doing [SIGH], like, stuff that's only politically, like, correct --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- or considered like that, it gets boring.  You gotta do something to shock people.
L:  Yeah, that politically correct crap, it's -- it -- th- there should be no limit on, you know, it's -- that's stupid to have that, you know?
R:  You know, like -- like with this rapper Eminem, like, he got, like, a lot of comedy in his music.
L:  Yeah, that's all he does.
R:  And sometimes I say -- you know what I mean?
L:  He talks the -- he talks the truth pretty much, you know?
R:  Yeah.  But sometimes he'll say some stuff that people are like, "Oh, I can't believe he said that" --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- but you sit there and think about it, you're like --
L:  -- who cares?  You know?
R:  -- that's kinda true.  And it's funny [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it is funny.  It's funny -- everything he says is funny.  I mean, he just says it to -- I don't know if he says it to say it, or he means it, but he just knows he's gonna get a rou- -- a rouse outta everybody, so he does it.  
R:  [NOISE] You know, and that's how it works. [NOISE]
L:  Everybody complains about -- everybody complains about what he says, but yet, they're the ones going out and buying the CD [SIGH]. 
R:  Exactly.  
L:  [MN]
R:  That's true.  The thing is, I mean, if you can get any strong emotional response from somebody [SIGH] when you're saying something, I mean, it's best to make 'em laugh, but then you know you've had an effect.  It's like if somebody's on stage and they're telling jokes and you just sit there and you hear crickets in the background, then they'll be doing bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But [SIGH] if everybody's mad, you know, they chuckle a little but they're mad at you, at least you know they'll remember you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At least you know you got your point across somewhere.
R:  Exactly.  Exac- --
L:  Yeah, I just -- I mean, I love -- I love comedy.  I love being funny, I love being an asshole at the same time I'm being fun- -- you know, it's just --
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  -- it's all fun, you know.  That's -- that's what co- --
R:  Sometimes that makes it more funny.
L:  Yeah, that's what comedy's supposed to be like that, you know?  When somebody's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thinking you're ignorant and you're just loving it 'cause you know they're hating it, but you're making everybody else laugh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's great, you know?  Christ, I was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I was the class clown in school all the time, you know, picking on everybody, but I -- as long as I was picking on one person, twenty other people were laughing --
R:  Were laughing, right.
L:  -- so I was -- I was happy, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  
L:  That's exactly what comedy is, that's why I don't think you can really draw a line.
R:  And that's why you can't really -- I mean, you can't really limit it.  I mean,  if it -- if it's in a business aspect, they can be like, "Oh, you can't say this, you can't say that".
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But people, like, in -- in the street, venues or other places, they're gonna say what they wanna say.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Yeah, I -- I hear people saying, like, a lot of the young comics today, they curse too much, and they're using too much profanity --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R:  -- and vulgarity [SIGH], but that's also the world we live in now.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, I -- I can't help fricking curse all the time, you know?  I don't know why, but [SIGH] ...
R:  [MN] I mean, but then, all the little kids are cussing all the time now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just -- that's the way the world is now.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's like five year olds, they're like [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] five, what with that?
L:  Yeah, I don't even -- I couldn't imagine saying that at five.
R:  [MN] Yeah, [inaudible] in fact, I was in the mall last week, you know?  [MN] And, um, there was, like, some little kids on the bottom level singing the ABCs.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I swear it's like these three six year olds, they by themselves -- well, I don't know their age, but they looked about six.  And they walk into the mall, and they see the little ones, um, [LIPSMACK] on the level below singing.  And they [inaudible] like, "Shut the fuck up".  I'm like, "Whoa" [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Really?
R:  Yeah, and --
L:  Damn.
R:  -- it's bad, but then again, it's funny, 'cause, like, people, like, fell for it, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's what makes it funny [LAUGH] -- little kids cursing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] There's just something funny about it, 'cause it's so bad.  I don't know.  
L:  Uh, yeah, I -- it's -- yeah, like you said, I mean, it's -- it's bad that they're young, but it's funny, 'cause it -- it is funny, you know?  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're not supposed to know what that means, but yet they're saying it, it just sounds funny coming from a little kid.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they're going say -- they're gonna wind up saying it five years from now anyway, what the hell's the difference?
R:  Basically.  That's pretty much the deal, you know?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.  Who is your favorite comedian [inaudible]?
L:  My favorite comedian?  Man, that's a tough one.  I --
R:  There's, like, so many.
L:  -- don't even know.
R:  There's, like, so ma- -- I mean, I come up on, like, Richard Pryor, Andrew Dice Clay and Geo- -- uh --
L:  I used to like Dice, yeah.  I haven't hear- -- I haven't seen any of his work in years, though.
R:  Man, he got banned from a lot of places.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That sucks.
L:  I like that guy, um, from, uh, Half Baked, the one guy that does the --
R:  Ooh, what, Dave Chappelle?
L:  Him and -- yeah, the -- th- the black guy, Dave Chappelle, and the white guy, that -- the crazy one that makes the weird, uh, voices.    
R:  Oh, he made the weird faces too?
L:  He does the -- the sheep on -- the lamb or whatever on Saturday Night Live.
R:  Yeah, he's funny as hell, now what's his name?  
L:  [MN]
R:  He always look -- he always looks stoned.
L:  Yeah, he does --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that "Baa" and starts -- on Saturday Night Live and starts talking like a human and then turns into a -- like, a goat or whatever, goat boy.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like him too.  
R:  Right, he's crazy.  I forget now, don't even know his name.
L:  Yeah, I forget his name too, but he's always on, like, Comedy Central and stuff doing stand up.  He's funny though.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I watch Comedy Central for hours, man.  I even like, um, Jerry Seinfeld.  'Cause, like --
L:  Yeah, Seinfeld's not bad.  He came to Atlan- -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he came around my neighborhood, uh, Atlantic City, I think, he's coming this month or next month.  
R:  True?
L:  Yeah, I would like to see him, but he's all sold out already.  He go- -- he's going back on stand up again [SIGH].
R:  He must just be doing it for the -- for, like, enjoyment of it [LAUGH].
L:  I guess, yeah, or he's gonna get a couple extra bucks real fast and then, you know, bail out [SIGH].
R:  Hustle, hustle.
L:  'Cause, you know, them guys can never have enough money. 
R:  Hey, you never can have enough though.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  The more you have the more you spend.
R:  [MN] And then the more you want.
L:  Yeah [MN].
R:  Like, uh, what's his name?  Bill Gates, he wants more.
L:  Oh, Christ, that guy.  Phew, wouldn't you like to be his brother?
R:  [NOISE] Man, sh- -- he should own, like, half the country by now, shouldn't he?  
L:  Yeah, probably.  He's got a lotta money.
R:  Yeah.  I think when I was coming up, I used to like, um, well, Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor too.
L:  Yeah, Eddie Murphy.  He was real raw.  Remember Eddie Murphy raw or whatever?
R:  Yeah, he was great.
L:  He -- he was always cursing and being dirty and he was great.  Remember being a kid, my parents would, like, get it on HBO and I'd [SIGH] pretend I wasn't listening.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You, like, sneak in the other room watching it.
R:  [inaudible] [LIPSMACK] And, like, uh, like Red Fox, and, uh, George Carlin was funny though too [MN].
L:  Oh, he's -- yeah, George Carlin.  He's really not even close to being politically correct, that guy.  He's all off the wall.
R:  That's why I like him, yeah.
L:  You know, with him, you don't -- you can't draw a line with him, 'cause he's just -- you know, everything he says is cursing, it's sexual and [MN] it's funny.  It's funny, though, that's, uh -- like you can't -- if you draw a line with him he's not funny any more.  You know --
R:  Yeah, 'cause --
L:  -- if you put a --
R:  -- a lot of times that's -- that's what is actually funny, crossing the line, it was funny a lot of times.
L:  Mhm, exactly.  Or else it wouldn't be comedy, it would just be conversation [MN].
R:  Hm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  [inaudible].  Like Chris Rock, he'll -- he'll do, like, a lotta -- I don't know, some people say it's political, sometimes, like, you know, just life, you know, life experiences --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but a lot of times that's why it's funny, 'cause it's like [inaudible] --
L:  'Cause you know it happened to you or someone you know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  You know, you knew you grew up that way.  Like [SIGH] -- like, I -- I remember his stand up with the Tussin -- the Robitussin, remember that?
R:  [MN] Robitussin?
L:  Yeah, he was saying, you know, uh, "Oh, I don't feel good", you know, just your -- your parents just gave you Tussin, Robitussin, you know?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Or whatever the hell.  I thought [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I thought, you know, they gave you it for everything, for no matter what was wrong with you, that's what you got --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Robitussin.  You know?
R:  You gotta broken leg, here's some -- take some Tussin, baby.
L:  Yeah, just go have some Tussin [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he's -- I guess he's one of my favorites, too [SIGH].  He's pretty funny.
R:  Yeah, stuff like that.  But you know what, though?  It seems like, I don't know, you think there's less funny female come- -- uh, comedians?
L:  What's that?
R:  Comediennes.  You think there's less funny female comedians or comediennes or whatever they call them?
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- yeah, I can't get into them.  I don't know, just -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  I've only seen a few that really, really made me laugh, you know?
L:  Like Wanda Sykes is pretty funny.
R:  Yeah, she -- she wow.
L:  Yeah, she's crazy.  She -- she's off the wall, man.  She just does and says whatever she wants about anybody.  It's funny, though.  You don't really see that from a woman, you know, they're usually scared to say things.
R:  Hm.  Yeah, that's -- yeah, maybe that's part of it 'cause [inaudible] they can't really say or they'll come off as, like, just nasty.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  They can't, like, do sexual, you know, jokes and stuff, I don't know. [SIGH] Yeah, I guess I -- yeah, women comedy -- comedians just [MN] don't do it for me  [SIGH].
R:  Hm.    
L:  Oh, man. [SIGH]
R:  That's wild [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, [inaudible] --
R:  There's gotta be -- oh, yeah, [inaudible] the Entertainer, too, he's funny, man.  He --
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I've seen bits and pieces of him.  I don't really -- I don't watch his show or anything.  I don't really -- I can't really get into him.  I don't know why, but ...
R:  I'm just too busy to see it.  I mean, [inaudible] comedy was good, but, you know.
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing that.  I haven't seen that yet.  That's old --
R:  That's pretty --
L:  -- that's what, like, two, three years old?  Yeah.
