L:  Hi, my name is Andrew.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Hi, Andrew.  My name's Holly.  How you doing?
L:  Uh, pretty good.  But I didn't catch your name, sorry.
R:  H- Holly.
L:  Hi [MN].  Uh, yes, we're supposed to just -- uh, it's my first time doing this.  We're just supposed to talk for ten minutes, is that right?
R:  Yeah, on the topic, generally.
L:  On the topic?
R:  This is my second time doing it [LAUGH]. 
L:  And we talk for ten minutes about whether we think the new minimum wage rate is sufficient?  Is that right?
R:  Yeah, mhm.  
L:  Okay, so what do you think?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't [LAUGH].  I don't think it's sufficient.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I -- I guess it's a question of sufficient for what?  I don't think it's sufficient to live on, or not to live pret- -- too well on.
R:  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre, huh?
L:  [SIGH] What i- -- what is the new minimum wage?  They just told us, but --
R:  I think they --
L:  -- I didn't quite catch it.
R:  -- said five fifteen.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, let's see, I'm gonna do the math.  Forty hours [LIPSMACK] -- if you worked a forty hour week at five dollars an hour you would make two hundred dollars.  Oh my God.  [SIGH] And then let's just find out what the extra fifteen cents is gonna get you.  Um --
L:  Well, that'll go to taxes, so we don't have to do it too -- too too fine, I don't think.
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you'd -- you would take home [SIGH] -- it -- it probably doesn't even cover taxes, actually, I'm thinking -- let me just see.
L:  Yeah, I'm sure not, yeah.
R:  Forty and twenty -- it's, um, another six dollars -- no [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you make two hundred and six dollars, [SIGH] so you'd take home, maybe, I don't know, I'm just guessing, like, a hundred and eighty nine or something.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I just, uh, moved to California, to Berkeley, and it's not enough to pay for anything here.
R:  No.  
L:  No.
R:  Absolutely not.  I just moved to California too, from New York I moved to Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.  
R:  Where did you move from?
L:  Uh, I been all over.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yep.  
R:  Hm.  [MN] Well, [SIGH] a hundred and eighty nine dollars a week [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  That's not even gonna pay rent in LA, I'm sure.
R:  No, it absolutely wouldn't.  One eighty nine times four a month -- well, say two hundred a mon- -- eight hundred, yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's about eight hundred dollars a month.  Seven hundred and fifty dollars a month, something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  [MN] And working forty hours, that's so tragic.  
L:  Well, I --
R:  How can they --
L:  -- I guess with the new min- -- with the minimum wage if you've got a family you basically have to work eighty hours a week or something like that, [MN] and then you've got no -- nothing to spend, no time to spend any money and the money'll go to your family to barely cover stuff.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  Four hun- -- yeah, 'cause it would be, like, um, [LIPSMACK] like, three hundred and eighty dollars a week or something.  That would be for, you know, a family --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for rent.  You know, if you worked eighty hours -- how do you work eighty hours though?  That's sixteen hours a day, five days a week.
L:  Yup, or a little bit over eleven each day if you work seven days.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Basically, I'm saying working all the time, that's the only way [SIGH] to make it work with a family.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, my God.  Eleven hours, seven days a week?  That's like [SIGH] -- insane.  And then the commute.  So, you're basically just a serf, or you know?
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I guess the minimum wage would work better in some small town where rents are two hundred dollars a month or something like that.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right.  
L:  And there's nothing to spend any money on, and you -- just food and rent and -- and maybe it, uh, adds up to enough to get by somehow.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Right, right.  But, yeah, in a -- in a ci- -- real city, oh, they're so high on crack -- that's insane.  How could they -- wow.
L:  Well, I guess -- I guess you have to go out and sell crack, then you got enough money with the minimum wage, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] There you go.
L:  -- from your -- from your other job, yeah.
R:  Right.  That would be it.
L:  Yup.
R:  So, the people who ma- -- they must be doing crack, the people who made up that rate, so they -- [SIGH] they could sell the crack to those people.
L:  Okay.
R:  The people who make up the rates.
L:  Yup.  Well, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't know what crack costs, but you won't be able to afford crack if --
R:  No, you couldn't do it.
L:  -- you're on a minimum wage job [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] You couldn't do it.  You'd have to just sell it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow.  I'm upset now [LAUGH].
L:  Okay.  So, what should we raise the minimum wage to then?
R:  What shou- -- what?
L:  We've decided five -- we've decided five just isn't enough, so [SIGH] -- go to ten?
R:  I think ten dollars an hour is a fair minimum wage.  You know, it's like, that's what a teenager should make in their first job, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think anyone's time is worth that.  An hour of your time?  Yeah.  [MN] And then people who, you know, don't have education or whatever reason they have that job, that's like fair enough.  So, you'd make four hundred dollars a week before taxes.  You'd take home about three fifty.
L:  Okay, so the new minimum wage is ten dollars.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's definitely much more doable.
L:  At least for cities in places like California and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- New York or wherever else like that.
R:  Definitely for New York, San Francisco, any town where, you know, where rent is [SIGH] the way rents are in these towns, yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's impossible to move somewhere else, um, to pay rent on the minimum wage, uh, type salary.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] 'Cause even if you were -- you can't even afford to move, you know, if, like, just the pri- -- the cost of moving.  There's no way to ever even make enough to move.
L:  Well, I guess all you can cover is Greyhound somewhere with two suitcases.
R:  Right [LAUGH].
L:  But then once you get to the other end, on whatever you saved on a minimum wage job, [SIGH] it's -- you better be getting a pay check in three or four days, because it's not gonna last too long.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Exactly.  And then you can never buy anything for the new place, or hopefully you get a furnished room.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  [LIPSMACK] And then, you know [LIPSMACK] -- wow.  [LIPSMACK] That's a real -- upsetting [LAUGH].  It's an upsetting topic -- I can't -- I never really thought about that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I've only been here a few days, I know -- I'm not too far from that, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, I'm actually housesitting, so [MN] if everybody was house sitting and got places to stay for free, then minimum wage could be lower.
R:  [MN] Right.  Well, the truth is that I don't make much more than that either, because I am [MN] new here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, it's the same situation.  I just took the crappiest jo -- you know?  To be quite honest, there's not a lot of work.  I tried to take, you know -- I looked for better jobs, but even the crappy jobs are hard to find right now, because of the unemployment and the economy.
L:  I think it's pretty much the same situation here.
R:  It -- you can't just get, like, [SIGH] I -- my experience was, you could always just get some job, you know, to hold you over for a little while 'til you got on your feet someplace.  [SIGH] But it -- it took me quite a while, you know?  To even find this crappy job [SIGH], and it's really a little scary, you know?
L:  Have you looked on Craig's list at all?
R:  Yeah, that's where I got it [LAUGH].  
L:  Look -- look -- look in the et cetera situa- -- et cetera section --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for focus groups.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That'll give you a little bit of extra cash one or two times.
R:  Yeah, I actually have gone on there.  I -- I regularly look on there actually.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  So, um, I haven't had a lotta luck, but, um, you know, I got my fingers crossed [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.  How did you find out about this particular program that led to this phone call that we're having today?
R:  I found out from the LA Press.
L:  And if you miss a call for some reason, you're not home when you said you were home, do they call you again?
R:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I'm not -- I couldn't commit to hours, so they told me I can just call when I am free.
L:  Oh, okay.  And could you call three days in a row and take care of your commitment that way, or how does it work?
R:  Yeah, I think you can.  I forgot to call, you know, after I did it the first time, and then I just remembered today, so I'll call today and then I'll call tomorrow.
L:  Okay.  And this is legitimate?  Like, they actually do pay and they don't sell your social security number --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and stuff like that?
R:  I had the same ques- -- concern.  I don't know, I'm -- my fingers are crossed that that's the case.  I kind of researched them a little.
L:  Okay.
R:  [MN] I called the college.
L:  Yes, apparently it is really affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Or that's what I read on the internet, anyway, so, um ...
R:  Yeah, I -- I actually spoke to people who confirmed that for me.  Like people who -- who'd a had no idea what I was talking about, but worked at the college, and they confirmed that the email address was real for the -- you know, the university and all.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  I thought it was a rather huge gamble, but, you know what?  I needed to make some money.
L:  Yup.  [SIGH] Are they supposed to mail your check?  Is that how it works, at the end of it?
R:  Yeah, it seems that it might take up to eight weeks though.
L:  Oh, I see, okay.  
R:  But it, um [LIPSMACK] -- what they said was [SIGH], um -- oh, what happened was I -- I filled out the whole thing and then I got to the end about the social security number, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And I -- I decided not to go ahead with it.  Like, I just w- went to it -- you know, I went to my browser and just hit another website, after I had filled in a lot of information, but I didn't formally submit it.  [SIGH] And then, like, I got to social security and then I was like, "Oh, no" and I, um, you know, I just left.  And then, I got an email back, like, it -- th- -- the information got submitted --
