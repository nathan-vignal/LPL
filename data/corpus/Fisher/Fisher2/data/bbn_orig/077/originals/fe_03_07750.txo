L:  Hi, my name's Amy Estee.
R:  Hello, my name is Margaret.
L:  Hi, Margaret.  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  So we're talking about the five dollar and fifteen cent minimum wage increase.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh --
L:  I thought it actually went to five seventy five, or I thought it was like, six twenty five.  I thought that it was much more than five fifteen.
R:  Uh, I thought so also but even at five seventy five I don't think it would be sufficient.
L:  N- no, I don't either.
R:  So [MN] --
L:  You can't survive on that.
R:  No.  No way.  I don't know how they come up with the, uh, minimum wage at -- at that price as --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- as expensive as things are today[?].
L:  Right.  I mean, but see, I always figured the minimum wage was like -- I always figured that minimum wage was not [MN] -- not -- not regulated for people to be supporting a family on but more for the part time, um, you know, high school, teenager, doing, you know --
R:  Yeah, or --
L:  -- scooping out ice cream, you know, on -- on, you know, after school, and just like, part time type jobs, was what I'd always grown up thinking what it was.  I remember getting into college finding out that people were actually surviving on that and I was like, "What? --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- You've gotta be kidding!" [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mm.  Oh yes, really.
L:  "How can you possibly survive?"  I mean, there's not enough housing supplementation or -- or anything, um, it just didn't make any sense to me.  So, yeah, no, I --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- I had thought that it was like, at the six dollar range, it was like, at six seven- [MN] that it had just increased a number of times recently.  But even at --
R:  Right.
L:  Even at seven dollars an hour I can't see where ...
R:  No.
L:  -- you could sup- -- yeah, I could see where you could perhaps support yourself in some way or fashion, I -- I -- I suppose.  I wouldn't know how to do it.
R:  But, uh, it wouldn't be -- that wouldn't be easy. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I wouldn't know how to do it but I'm sure --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- someone could probably figure it out.  But, um, even at seven dollars an hour you couldn't support a family.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, you could only maybe support yourself.
R:  That is true.  That's the way I feel also.  But with so many people getting out of jobs now, I guess, oh, five seventy five or seven dollars would be better than nothing.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh, i- it -- it certainly isn't a -- a sufficient, uh, wage increase.
L:  Yeah, absolutely not.
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  Well, I work for a privately owned company and, I mean, he -- it's never been -- we've -- I don't -- I don't think that there is any position here that is minimum wage.
R:  Oh no, [inaudible].
L:  I wanna say that our lowest hourly paid job is, I think, at ten dollars an hour.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well that's, yeah, that's [LAUGH] considered or almost considered minimum -- minimum wage at this day, really.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  So I can't, uh, I do- -- I don't know where -- where are you calling from, Margaret?  What's -- what --
R:  Uh, I'm from Maryland.
L:  Maryland?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm calling from southern California.
R:  Southern California, oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I'm [inaudible] ray at the beach so I mean, it's -- I -- you know, I just didn't know if maybe it in Maryland, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but -- but not Maryland is just as expensive as [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- as California. [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- but it would be anything different.  Because I mean obviously they're taking the whole nationwide average.
R:  Oh yeah, [several inaudible words].  [NOISE]  I don't know, they [SIGH] -- someone needs to go back and reassess that increase [LAUGH], if that's what it really is.
L:  Well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for argument's sake, what would be, like say, other than a -- than a minimum wage increase, what other options do you think that the government would have in creating a better standard of living?
R:  Other options, uh, other than the, uh, minimum wage increase?
L:  Yeah.  O- other than that.  I mean, like, subsidized housing or perhaps, um, job training or lower rates for community college, though I can't imagine them getting any cheaper than -- than they are! [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Uh, really, uh, well, uh, training would -- would help I would think, um ...
L:  So I wanna say that the community colleges around here are like, ten dollars a unit.  So I mean, like --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- for, you know, eighteen weeks of classes, seventeen weeks, eighteen weeks being the -- the final week, it's like, thirty dollars, you know, for a whole class --
R:  [inaudible] oh, yeah.
L:  -- at a community college.  So I mean I could really see that someone, if they were inclined to do so, to actually go and educate themselves in other opportunities then they would have that option at -- at the community college level.  But they couldn't -- not at a university level, those are extremely more expensive.
R:  Yes.  Uh, but the -- even i- with -- if they were having -- if they're working -- if they were working at minimum wage they could not afford to -- to do that even.
L:  I would even --
R:  So [inaudible] --
L:  -- say there might even be additional like, financial aid if you're not --
R:  [inaudible].
L:  If you're only making m- minimum wage then there'd have to be a financial aid available --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even at the community college level.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's the time factor, that's what I'm trying to think.  It's like, this minimum wage, is it really supposed to be for the family, for the major breadwinner for the, you know, for the head of household so to speak, um, in tax terms, that that's what they're supposed to be making --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- is five dollars and fifteen cents?
R:  Oh, that's just, uh --
L:  'Cause I've sorta always thought of it as being with the part time job for the high schooler, you know?
R:  R- right, that was more realistic for, you know, just for the part times, for them to have just some spending money so to speak, yes, uh [inaudible].
L:  I know.  And even trying to think of even what that would be.  I mean, w- with being a teenager these days.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, I don't even see a teenager around here who doesn't have a cellphone.
R:  True. [LAUGH]
L:  Is it the same in Maryland?
R:  Y- oh yes, very.
L:  I mean, every single high school kid has a cellphone.  I -- I -- I can hardly afford one [LAUGH] and I don't -- I don't even talk on it.  So I'm trying to think, so if -- if they make, let's see -- so if maybe a high schooler would maybe work, what, maybe twenty hours a week?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, or some- -- I guess that would be something in that area, yeah.
L:  So it's a hundred and three dollars a week and then minus taxes is maybe, what, sev- seventy five dollars a week?
R:  A week, yeah.
L:  [NOISE] So they're maybe making three hundred bucks a month?
R:  Mm.
L:  That's insane.
R:  Th- th- yeah, it really is.
L:  How could -- how could like, a head of household -- well, it's not even -- as I did that at -- at twenty hours a week but double that, that's six hundred dollars.  So six hundred dollars a month is what those minimum wage people are earning.
R:  Oh my.  So what are you, a calc- -- have a calculator there?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]  Very good, good for you --
L:  Yeah, no, I'm not that quick at math, no! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, okay.  [several inaudible words].
L:  No, but forty hours times five fifteen, that's two hundred and six dollars a week.  I don't know, I -- thirty percent is -- that makes one forty four, and then we'll times that times four, that's five hundred and seventy five dollars a month.
R:  Per month.
L:  Five seventy -- I was saying six hundred, it's not even six hundred, it's five seventy.
R:  Oh my word. [MN] [MN]
L:  Five seventy seven, five seventy five.  A month.
R:  Five seven- -- oh!  That's four --
L:  But how could that possibly be -- I mean, and your rent is only supposed to be one third of that, so you have to find rent for a hundred and ninety two dollars.
R:  Where? [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Oh.
L:  'Cause your rental is supposed to be one third of what your income is and then, you know, one third paying for your past, one third paying for your future. [SIGH]  Well, a hundred and ninety two dollars for rent.  For your whole family.
R:  Oh my --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- God.
L:  I mean, that's --
R:  That -- that is -- it's -- they're just [inaudible] --
L:  I wonder where this average is taken, where they're going, "Yeah, okay, five hundred and fif- -- five -- five dollars and fifteen cents"?
R:  [SIGH] Uh, mm mm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that needs to --
R:  That -- that's bad.
L:  [MN] Yeah, it's insane.
R:  It's -- it's pitiful.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  It is really [inaudible].
L:  It's absolutely pitiful.
R:  Really sad.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But I don't know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what else to, um, you know, I mean, I -- I just kind of made s- -- I would almost wanna say that that -- though I don't wanna say because I really don't wanna discriminate and say, okay, well then someone who has -- 'cause I'm so against, um, women getting paid less and doing the same job for less pay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I -- I love that equality, or would love to have that kind of equality.  But I always figure --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that, oh, if you're the man then you're -- you're the breadwinner and you need to bring home more money.
R:  Yeah.  But that isn't always the case.
L:  No, it's not at all.
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Most the time the man -- not most, I mean there is --
R:  A lot of time[?] --
L:  Uh, a, uh, a huge percentage of men that will --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- leave and so then if we're talking about a woman trying to support a child and herself on her own, maybe with some babysitting help from her parents or something but [LAUGH] -- but sometimes not.
R:  Yeah, [inaudible].
L:  And -- and then, you know, having -- with this less pay, doing the same job but getting less pay than an equal male counterpart.
R:  [MN] Yeah.  Isn't fair, not fair at all [inaudible].  If they're doing the same work that the man is, they should get the same pay, I don't[?] know how they come up with that idea that the woman doesn't deserve the same pay as the man.
L:  This is one of my pet --
R:  The men.
L:  -- peeves though, because [inaudible] is, it costs so much more to be a woman.  Like, our haircuts cost more.  Our --
R:  Truly.
L:  -- razor blades cost more, you know, to shave our legs versus shave your face --
R:  Truly.
L:  -- they cost more.  Um, just the same basic things.  You take like, [MN] just, I mean --
R:  A- --
L:  -- just about anything, I mean --
R:  Anything, everything.
L:  -- if you take, um, if you go into a Target store or any kind of mass merchandising store and you're looking for just a plain old pair of sweat pants and you go get the exact same pair of sweat pants from the women's department and the exact same, you know, Haines, you know, size large sweat pants with the same, you know, exact everything, in the women's department and the men's department, the women's department will be more expensive.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they are the exact same pants.
R:  That -- yeah, that's true, I understand what you're saying, and I, uh, have experienced that too.
L:  So it's actually -- so, and -- and as far as I'm concerned it's like the women should be making more.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  They have to wear all that make up.  Make up is expensive.  Keeping your --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  The maintenance, just the basic maintenance of
