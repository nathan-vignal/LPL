L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Dara.
R:  I'm Marla.
L:  Um, I'm from Alabama, so ...
R:  Okay, I'm from Virginia.  I have a sister in law here from Alabama just today. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wow.
R:  So, for them increase -- minimum wage increase to five dollars, is that what they said?
L:  Five fifteen, I think, or s- --
R:  Five fifteen.  What is it right now, do you know?
L:  I do not know.
R:  I'm a stay at home mom and so it's been a while since I've --
L:  Well, I do, um, I'm a stay at home mom and I also do daycare in my home. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  So I get less --
R:  So minimum wage doesn't affect you, you charge what you want.
L:  Right.  But sometimes I think I get less than [LAUGH] minimum wage for --
R:  Hourly you probably do.  Huh.
L:  When it comes down to it, um --
R:  Right.
L:  But even five -- even if it's five fifteen I still [MN] --
R:  That seems very low --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me.
L:  It does.  I mean, [NOISE] I have a lot of friends who, you know, are moms and they have to work outside the home and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and, you know, they barely make minimum wage and it's [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by the time they pay for daycare they're not making anything.
R:  Right.
L:  And that.  So, I mean ...
R:  I guess the biggest problem I -- and I -- I may not know enough to have such an opinion but the biggest problem I see though is that it seems like whenever +minimum rage -- minimum wage goes up, so does the cost of living, you know.
L:  That's true too.
R:  And so it's almost like you can't -- you can't catch up.  And so I don't know that it would -- I mean, obviously I think that five dollars and fifteen cents or whatever they said --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is not enough, but I don't know that increasing it any more is really gonna make a huge difference.
L:  That's it.
R:  So I don't know -- I don't know what the solution would be, but [SIGH] --
L:  I don't know if there [LAUGH] is a solution 'cause y- it's very true, I mean, everything -- if minimum wage goes up then cost of living goes up.  If it goes down then usually cost of living goes down a little bit but still not enough to make ends --
R:  Really, right.  It's just this -- this s- seems to be just be -- just be even.
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, so that you don't, I don't know, it just -- [LIPSMACK] I don't know what the solution be.  Like you said, I don't know if there is a solution.
L:  I --
R:  Except individuals just, you know, getting education or whatever to -- to go to qualify for higher paying jobs but that's just not --
L:  No, and even nowadays --
R:  -- feasible for everybody.
L:  [MN]
R:  And somebody's gotta work the minimum wage jobs, right? [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.
R:  You know.  So, I don't know.
L:  I mean, it's very, um, true. [LAUGH]  You can't make more -- much more than minimum wages for certain jobs anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, fast food and waitressing and --
R:  Right.  Things like that are ...
L:  Uh, I mean, grocery store workers o- or any of that usually don't make more than minimum wage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know that, um, at one time I worked in a daycare and it's statistically that daycare workers get paid less than minimum wage.
R:  Now that doesn't seem right. [LAUGH]
L:  No.  But, um, then if you think about teachers, the majority of teachers don't make more than minimum wage when they count all the hours that they have to put in.
R:  Right.  'Cause so often they have to work beyond just the school day.
L:  Right.
R:  [NOISE] Especially if they -- if they're involved with like, if they're music teachers or things that -- that are like, um [LIPSMACK], you know, the subjects where they have extra curricular clubs or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- things like that.  So --
L:  And even just the planning the -- the weekly, you know --
R:  Erica, stop.
L:  -- classrooms, that's extra things.  Grading too.
R:  Right.  You need to take things home.
L:  Right.  I mean, so [MN] and -- and teachers to me are one of the ones that need to be paid more.
R:  Sure.
L:  For the simple fact that they educate our children.
R:  Right.
L:  And that.  So, I don't know if they're --
R:  And so often their education is as expensive as some of, you know, like, if you get a degree in business you can go to work after the same four years of college and get paid so much more.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, a teacher, they put the same amount of effort into their education and yet --
L:  But --
R:  -- they don't get compensated for the -- the hours that they put in for work, so ...
L:  That's true.
R:  So maybe there should be a minimum wage for teachers, I don't know! [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, uh, yes.
R:  But --
L:  Now, how did, um, can I ask you how you found out about this?
R:  [LIPSMACK] A friend told me.
L:  A friend.
R:  She had -- I don't know how she found it but she found it.
L:  [MN]
R:  And then she forwarded it to me.
L:  Oh neat.
R:  So ...
L:  So how many children do you have?
R:  I have, um, four. [LAUGH]  So that's why I had to stop and think!  I have four.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have -- I have almost five year old twins and almost three year old twins.
L:  No way!
R:  Yeah.
L:  How neat.
R:  Yeah. [SIGH] [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I know you're [inaudible] --
R:  It's pretty intense --
L:  -- yeah!
R:  I mean, I love 'em to pieces but it's pretty intense, they're all so little. [LAUGH]
L:  I --
R:  I think as they get older it will -- it will become more of an advantage to have them all so close but ...
L:  Now, did you have, uh, I'm nosey [MN] -- did you have fraternal or identical?
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Did you --
R:  They're -- they're all fraternal.  I have a girl and boy and two girls but none of 'em are identical.
L:  Okay.  'Cause I was just gonna say, wow that'd really be unique, I would think, to have two sets of identical.
R:  I think that's not as common.
L:  [inaudible].  But even just two sets of twins in one family is uncommon too, I mean ...
R:  Right.  I don't personally know anybody else with two sets of twins.  I hear about it all the time but I don't know anybody.
L:  I always wanted twins.  I know that people --
R:  Everybody sa- --
L:  -- probably tell you that!
R:  Oh yes, oh yes!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- I think that's so cute. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, until you get 'em at -- well, my first two were eleven months apart so it was like, you know, they needed -- my eleven month old at the time didn't walk, you know, yet and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- any of that stuff, so -- but then I was sitting there thinking, sometimes I wonder if it'd been easier just to have two at the same time?
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I had a good friend who -- well let's see, well mine were not quite a year and a half, she had her second baby just like a year and two weeks after her first and, you know, as I thought about that I thought that must be harder because their needs wouldn't -- your -- their needs wouldn't be the same.  But a one year old is hardly less demanding than a newborn.
L:  Right.
R:  But that you -- you need different things and -- like, at least my twins, they're always used to sharing me with somebody else, it didn't bother them.  But like, my friend anyway, her one year old got real --
L:  Jealous.
R:  -- especially since she wasn't able to completely wean her before the second baby was born --
L:  Right.
R:  -- she was breastfeeding and so she'd almost had her weaned but then when the second baby was born and she was breastfeeding, she wa- you know, that was the end of that, she was breastfeeding both of 'em.
L:  Both of 'em, yes.
R:  Sh- it was just really something that was frustrating to her and she couldn't [NOISE] do one without the older one wanting to do at the same time and so it was a real --
L:  Oh, I could imagine.
R:  -- issue.
L:  I -- yeah, I have five children so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and mine are real basically close in age, I have eight, seven, five, two and four months.
R:  Sure, close enough, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Close enough.  Yes.  The first two were really close and then, you know, we just kinda spaced a little bit more [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with each one.
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] that.  But, I mean, I could -- so, having two five year olds and two three year olds I could, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kinda ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my five year olds are going into the kindergarten in the fall and part of me is real sad and kind of freaking out about it but part of me i- is just thinking it just will be so much calmer and I'll be able to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- think and, you know, my poor little ones -- me -- and they all get along fine, but they have no idea what it's like to just get the --
L:  Have --
R:  -- attention they want, you know?
L:  Right.  Oh yes.
R:  They have to compete for everything.  You know, the older two they pr- pretty much play with what they want to because they're bigger and stronger and, you know, my l- -- my younger ones, they -- they have to just really f- fight for what they want and -- and it's hard to even that out, you can't be in the same room with them twenty four hours a day, so --
L:  Oh yeah.  Mine are constantly competing.  They compete over the silliest things too and it just drives me crazy.
R:  Yes.  You're like, "Man --"
L:  You know, they'll compete over --
R:  "-- how important --" [LAUGH]
L:  -- over how much food -- they'll count -- they'll count down their, you know, if I scoop out green beans on a plate they'll --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- count out how many green beans they each have.
R:  She has two more than me!
L:  They do it.  And I'm like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Oh, please!"  And I'll sit there and just --
R:  "Give me a break!"
L:  -- snatch the two off the extra plate!
R:  That's right!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right! [LAUGH]
L:  "They're mine now!"
R:  "Now you have the same amount!"
L:  [LAUGH] But, I mean, so, uh, uh, everything is a competition between 'em and -- and my oldest is a girl and then I have three boys and then --
R:  Me [inaudible] --
L:  -- the baby's a girl, so it's like the three boys together, it's just constant bicker, bicker, bicker --
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  -- and I'm like, "Oh, please, I can't wait till y'all are all in school".
R:  Right.
L:  And that, 'cause my five year old starts kindergarten this -- and I'm like, "Three in school, two down!"
R:  [LAUGH] Well you know, I just got one of my little ones potty trained and I still just -- the w- -- the other one she's not quite ready to do that yet, but this -- I was telling my husband, I said, "This is the first time that we've ever had one baby in diapers!" [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  I was sitting there s- -- I was sitting there thinking that the other day, I was like, "I have had one of my children in diapers or Pull Ups for eight years now".
R:  Right. [LAUGH]  That's a lotta time.
L:  'Cause every time -- I mean, my children were all strong willed, none of 'em wanted to be potty trained unfortunately.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  And my two year old, he -- well, he'll be two next week, but he's starting to show and I'm like, "Oh thank you, maybe I'll actually have one potty trained at two" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that.  And I said, "And then I'll only have one left in diapers" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and that.  'Cause I have to laugh becau- [SIGH] 'cause it's like, diapers all the time.
R:  Yes.
L:  Diaper bag.  I said, "I don't even know what it's like to carry a purse".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it's --
R:  I know it.
L:  -- rare to carry one of those 'cause I always have a child with me so there's always --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a diaper bag needed.
R:  [inaudible], absolutely.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my first two, they were really easy to potty train but, I mean, the second -- there's one that would -- that just has done it.  She was potty trained for about a week about two months ago and then she just changed her mind and she would not go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So she was right back in her Pull Ups.
L:  Yeah, they have that --
R:  And then --
L:  -- stubborn stage.
R:  Yes they do.  And then just a couple of weeks ago I thought, "You know, this is enough".  So it had been about a month and a half so I put underwear back on her one day and I was like [MN] -- said, "Now, do we go pee pee in our underwear?  No, only in the potty" and that was it.
L:  Hey.
R:  She just needed to be refreshed I guess and so she's -- and it stuck this time I think.  But the other one, she'll sit on it but she's never gone and so I don't know if she really gets it yet. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they -- I mean --
R:  So --
L:  Everybody tells me, you know, "They'll be potty trained.  You don't see too many in high school that are --" [LAUGH]
R:  Well that -- that's true, so -- my first two were just so easy but it just, uh, it surprised me that this other -- that it might -- she's actually the youngest by an hour and a half -- but it just surprised me that she
