R:  Hi, this is Wanda from New Mexico.
L:  [SIGH] Hi, Wanda, my name is Bill.  I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  [SIGH] How're you doing today?
L:  I'm doing well [SIGH].
R:  How do you distinguish between what's in good taste -- uh, comedic -- and what's not in good taste?
L:  [MN] I have no idea [SIGH].  I really don't know.  That's a very good question [SIGH].  Um [MN] --
R:  Is there anybody -- is there a comedian, um, that you find whose humor is in bad taste, or ...?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, I guess, like Howard Stern, I find that really offensive.
R:  I find him offensive too.  [SIGH] Uh, what -- what makes him offensive?
L:  Um, I just --
R:  To you?
L:  -- I just feel like he's just, uh, [SIGH] treats everyone [MN] really badly.
R:  [SIGH] I -- I agree.  I think in -- in -- in particularly, I -- I think he treats women, [SIGH] um, with disrespect -- with a lot of disrespect.  [SIGH] Um, I don't like comedy that -- that puts people down, [MN] I don't like comedy that stereotypes racial, um, that -- that's full of a lot of racial stereotypes, um, in a negative manner.  [SIGH] I mean, it's all right if you laugh at yourself, but when you're [SIGH] laughing at someone else it's not always [SIGH], um, in good taste.
L:  Yeah, I can see that.  I mean, I'm [SIGH] -- I don't know, I mean, [MN] it really depends on -- it's not so much the topics as the way the particular entertainer handles them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And how they're presented.  And, um, [SIGH] some people, I guess, I don't know, like [SIGH] -- well, I don't really listen to, um, morning radio, but anything I've ever heard, I guess they're all imitations of Howard Stern, I just find really [SIGH], really offensive.  I remember, there was a guy named Andrew Dice Clay and I found him really offensive.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  I didn't find him funny.  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, [MN] I -- I don't know.  I'm trying to think of anyone who does anything similar that I don't find offensive.  But I guess you're right, there are certain things that are just [SIGH], um, [MN] just badly done.  But I don't even think it's [MN] -- see, I don't know if even Howard Stern -- I guess people find him very funny, so I guess he counts as a comedian, I guess, but I just, uh [MN] -- I don't know.  I'm trying to think of an actual stand up comedian or something [MN].
R:  That -- well, Andrew Dice Clay was considered --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a comedian.
L:  Yeah.  But I mean, I haven't actually seen him work in, [SIGH] I don't know, five or ten years, [MN] I guess.
R:  I know, me too.
L:  Yeah.  I think he -- he did himself in pretty well.
R:  Yeah --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um --
R:  -- could be.
L:  -- [SIGH] paid the price of his own excesses, I guess [MN].
R:  Yeah, for [MN] -- for instance, I -- I kinda became aware about [LIPSMACK], oh, probably about twenty years ago, when I heard a -- a joke that I thought was funny and it to do with [SIGH], um, black people and [SIGH] I told it to a friend of mine that was black and [SIGH] -- and she said, "That's not funny, Wanda, that's -- that's really, um, in bad taste" and -- and I think I -- it kind of woke me up to -- to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- making fun of people.  Um, [SIGH] I have a lot of gay friends, or I used to, and when people would start making jokes about gays, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in bad -- uh, well, see, then we go in bad taste.  Um, like putting them down.  [MN] I mean, it's okay if you wanna [SIGH] -- wanna make a joke about gays and being hairdressers, you know, or interior decorators, or [SIGH] -- or Richard Simmons, or -- but when, um --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you're starting to make jokes [SIGH] about people that -- that are demeaning to those people, then I think that -- I think that's where the line is drawn.
L:  Mm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, I mean, I -- I tend to agree with you, but I can see [SIGH] somebody else, particularly if they were gay, might say, "You know what?  I'm, you know, I'm a construction worker and I really find those stereotypes offensive --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and it's really limiting and people only think of you as that way" or whatever, so, [MN] um --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I don't know, I mean, you know, gays in the military.  I mean, obviously there's gays in the military, so [SIGH] to pretend they're not there and then to pretend they're just hairdressers or something is [SIGH] a farce, or something like that.  It's [SIGH] -- sort of makes it a lot easier to say, "Well, they shouldn't be in the military", you know, so --
R:  Yeah.  Well, I --
L:  [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  -- I'm in an area where there's a lot of native Americans, particularly Navajos, in New Mexico, [SIGH] and [MN] I know that I would find it extremely offensive if somebody -- if somebody were to make a joke about [SIGH] native Americans, "You know how they are, they -- they just [SIGH], um, uh, go to town and get drunk" or something like that.  [SIGH] And it's -- it's truly a [MN] -- a big problem in this area with drunk drivers and such, and we do have a large Native American population, but -- but it's a negative stereotyping, I think [SIGH].  There's a -- I'm trying to think of a comedian, [SIGH] um, sometimes there's comedians that [SIGH] out of their mouths comes so much -- so much profanity that I find it offensive [SIGH].
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and don't get me wrong, I can -- I can swear when I get pissed off and -- and it doesn't bother me if somebody [SIGH] swears once in a while or [SIGH], you know?  But when it's -- it's ju- -- you just get inundated with it, I find that that goes over the top with me.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, I -- yeah, it's -- yeah.  Well, [MN] I think, uh, oh, again I agree with you.  I don't know -- I don't know if we're having much of a conversation since we're in agreement, but, um --
R:  We're talking.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think that's what --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think that's what the whole key is here.
L:  I think, uh, yeah, I think if I just hear somebody where it's just, like, if it was on [SIGH], I don't know, regular television, like David Letterman or something like that, it would be beeped out, um [SIGH], I find that, uh, not so much offensive as just it's not funny --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [SIGH] which I kinda find offensive too.  I mean, I don't know people who [MN] -- who are paid to be comedians who I don't find funny, I find that, in some way, offensive.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] So, [MN] uh, there's people [SIGH] like, [SIGH] uh, [LIPSMACK] Chris Rock, for instance, [SIGH] he can be very [LIPSMACK], very, um, uh, explicit, um, but on the other hand I find him to be quite funny [SIGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if other people use the same language, but are not as funny, then I don't really wanna see them, you know?  I just --
R:  You think part of it's in the delivery?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, sure.  I think it's -- I think it's the delivery, I think it's the, um, [MN] the thought that went into creating the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- joke, you know?  Um [SIGH], you know, some things are -- are just offensive and some -- some things in life are just [SIGH], you know, offensive topics that we have to live with anyway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know?  And it's part of being alive, so I think any -- [SIGH] anything in life is -- is subject to humor.  I think it makes people use humor [SIGH] to get through things.
R:  Mhm.
L:  However, it really depends on how it's handled, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, so [SIGH] -- uh, [SIGH] like -- like Chris Rock.  I've -- I've heard him on, uh, uh, DVDs and things like that on his shows he's had released [MN], and it is something.  I mean, obviously I'd never let my daughter listen to it or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, [LIPSMACK] but it is pretty funny.  But, on the other hand, there's other people that I've seen [SIGH], um, [LIPSMACK] that have been, you know, like, bleeped out, like, every -- every other word, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even if you sort of figure out what the words are, it's not funny.
R:  Yeah, well --
L:  Um --
R:  -- well, you just brought up another one, I thi- -- another issue, and I think [SIGH] that part of being offensive has to do with who you're with.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you were -- if you were with your daughter, [SIGH] I'm sure that you would find more things offensive than [SIGH] -- than -- than you would if you were by yourself.
L:  Exactly.  
R:  You know?  Or your mother or something, you know?
L:  Right, [LIPSMACK] right.  It also depends on the -- you know, on the audience.  I mean, for instance [SIGH], there's a [SIGH] -- on black entertainment television there's a [SIGH] -- there's a lot of comedy -- stand up comedy shows --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's -- it's strictly black comedians making jokes to -- almost entirely black comedians making jokes to almost entirely black audiences.
R:  Right.
L:  So, [SIGH] I don't find that funny, because I'm not black.  Not that it's offensive, 'cause it's on television, it's nothing really obscene.  Some of it is -- does put down women, but some of it's by women comedians, it puts down men.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I don't mind it, but I just don't find it funny, 'cause I don't think -- because I'm not black, and this is very much rooted in the black experience --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that I just can't relate to it [SIGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [SIGH] um, it's not a --
R:  Black experiences, kinda thing?
L:  -- yeah, it's not -- yeah, it's sorta like, you know, you all know about this, like going to [SIGH], you know, whatever, church or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's very much like a joke based on a black [SIGH] churchgoing experience.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I don't have that experience, so I'm --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- not gonna find that funny.  But I don't, on the other hand, find it offensive.  I just --
R:  [MN] Well, as long as --
L:  -- I just don't get it.
R:  Yeah.  When you talk about religion, [SIGH] my husband got really offended when I made a joke about [MN] a -- back, about all the pedophiles -- priest.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  You know?  And -- 'cause he's -- he is very Catholic, and -- and [MN] I mean, that struck at his belief system --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think that's what caused that to be offensive to him.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And I told him, "Well, honey --"
