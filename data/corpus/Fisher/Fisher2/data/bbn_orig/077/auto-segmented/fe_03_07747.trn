HI  (fe_03_07747-A-0002)
OKAY WELL I THINK WE'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ON THE TOPIC OF MINIMUM WAGE AND IF WE THINK THAT IS SUFFICIENT  (fe_03_07747-A-0003)
UM  (fe_03_07747-A-0004)
UH AT FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS AN HOUR [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW OF COURSE THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT  (fe_03_07747-A-0005)
NO I MEAN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ESPECIALLY ABOUT WOMEN WORKING MINIMUM WAGE JOBS MAKING FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR  (fe_03_07747-A-0006)
UM THERE'S NO WAY THEY COULD SUPPORT A FAMILY ON THAT  (fe_03_07747-A-0007)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07747-A-0008)
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_07747-A-0009)
SO NO I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A SUFFICIENT MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07747-A-0010)
UH YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE AND I I ALSO DON'T THINK PAYING FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR THAT THE EMPLOYER IS PROBABLY GETTING THE BEST QUALITY OF WORK  (fe_03_07747-A-0011)
NO  (fe_03_07747-A-0012)
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY I I THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE IT PROBABLY IS SUFFICIENT FOR ARE TEENAGERS WHO ARE IN  (fe_03_07747-A-0013)
UM HIGH SCHOOL OR IN COLLEGE  (fe_03_07747-A-0014)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07747-A-0015)
YES IT IS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT HAS IT HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED I'M THINKING BACK TO THE TIMES WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR MINIMUM WAGE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL  (fe_03_07747-A-0016)
AND UM I I KNOW WHEN I STARTED I WAS MAKING THREE SEVENTY FIVE AN HOUR AND THAT WAS MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07747-A-0017)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07747-A-0018)
YEAH AND I REMEMBER THINKING ACTUALLY THAT THAT WAS A FORTUNE  (fe_03_07747-A-0019)
AT THAT POINT AND I WAS FIFTEEN WHEN I STARTED WORKING AND I REMEMBER IT IT IT RAISING SOMEWHAT YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE YEARS BUT  (fe_03_07747-A-0020)
UM YOU KNOW AFTER I WENT TO COLLEGE THAT THAT WASN'T AN ISSUE BUT I I MEAN I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT IN I GUESS I THINK THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE BEING FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR REALLY CONTRIBUTES TO A LOT OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE AS WELL  (fe_03_07747-A-0021)
AND THAT'S THAT I THINK IF PEOPLE CAN'T SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY ON THEIR INCOME THEN THEY'RE GONNA TURN TO  (fe_03_07747-A-0022)
UM TO VARIOUS CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES THEY'RE GONNA SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME BY SELLING DRUGS BY STEALING  (fe_03_07747-A-0023)
UM AND BY PROSTITUTION  (fe_03_07747-A-0024)
AND I KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE BECAUSE I WORKED IN A PRISON  (fe_03_07747-A-0025)
UM FOR THE LAST FIVE AND A HALF YEARS  (fe_03_07747-A-0026)
AND THAT'S WHAT WE FREQUENT FREQUENTLY SAW THERE  (fe_03_07747-A-0027)
WITH WOMEN W- YOU KNOW IT WAS A IT WAS A WOMEN'S STATE PRISON  (fe_03_07747-A-0028)
AND UM WHAT WE WORKED WITH THERE WERE WOMEN WHO JUST COULDN'T SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T EDUCATED THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND MANY OF THEM ARE MINORITIES AND THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES JUST WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THEM  (fe_03_07747-A-0029)
AND SO THEY WORK IN JOBS LIKE HOUSEKEEPING YOU KNOW MCDONALD'S FAST FOOD THAT PAID MINIMUM WAGE AND AND THEY JUST COULDN'T DO IT  (fe_03_07747-A-0030)
MM  (fe_03_07747-A-0031)
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT IF THEY RAISE MINIMUM WAGE AND THEY START PAYING THE EMPLOYEES MORE THEN THE COST TO EVERYONE ELSE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS WILL GO UP  (fe_03_07747-A-0032)
THAT'S THE DILEMMA  (fe_03_07747-A-0033)
BUT IF WE WANNA KEEP PRICES REASONABLE THEN PAY THE WORKERS MINIMUM WAGE AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES THEY'RE GONNA BE UM THEY'RE GONNA END UP IN PRISON AND OTHER PLACES WHERE WE END UP OUT OF OUR TAX DOLLARS SUPPORTING THEM ANYHOW  (fe_03_07747-A-0034)
YOU KNOW IT'S DEFINITELY A A SOCIAL PROBLEM AND ALTHOUGH IT'S INCREASED SOMEWHAT YOU KNOW FIVE FIFTEEN I MEAN WHEN I THINK ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS AN HOUR AND MY FAMILY NOW AND TRYING TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY ON THAT THAT'S CRAZY  (fe_03_07747-A-0035)
WE'RE MAKING MORE MONEY FOR THIS TEN MINUTE PHONE CALL [LAUGHTER] THAN THEY MAKE [LAUGHTER] YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07747-A-0036)

YOU KNOW THAT IF THEY PAID THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE AND OFFERED BETTER BENEFITS AND DIDN'T TRY TO HIRE YOU KNOW THE OTHER THINGS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE DOING TODAY IS TRYING TO HIRE EVERYONE ON A PART TIME BASIS INSTEAD OF A FULL TIME BASIS 'CAUSE THEN THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE BENEFITS  (fe_03_07747-A-0069)
