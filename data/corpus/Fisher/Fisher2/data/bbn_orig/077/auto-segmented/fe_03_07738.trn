HELLO  (fe_03_07738-A-0001)
HI MY NAME IS MONICA  (fe_03_07738-A-0002)
HI CINDY  (fe_03_07738-A-0003)
FINE THANK YOU  (fe_03_07738-A-0004)
SO TODAY'S TOPIC IS MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07738-A-0005)
UM  (fe_03_07738-A-0006)
I DON'T THINK MIN- THAT FIVE FIFTEEN IS ENOUGH WHAT DO YOU THINK  (fe_03_07738-A-0007)
IT'S VERY HARD I MEAN YOU CAN'T EVEN QUALIFY FOR AN APARTMENT MAKING FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR  (fe_03_07738-A-0008)
IN MOST PLACES  (fe_03_07738-A-0009)
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE A BETTER WAGE  (fe_03_07738-A-0010)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07738-A-0011)
YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0012)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07738-A-0013)
YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0014)
WHAT IS IT LIKE THREE DOLLARS OR TWO DOLLARS AND SOMETHING  (fe_03_07738-A-0015)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07738-A-0016)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07738-A-0017)
ENOUGH TIPS  (fe_03_07738-A-0018)
YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0019)
I THINK MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A  (fe_03_07738-A-0020)
MAYBE AN AGE LIMIT ON THE FIVE FIFTEEN OR YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU'RE SIXTEEN TO MAYBE TWENTY  (fe_03_07738-A-0021)
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE THE FIVE FIFTEEN BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE OLDER THAN THAT OR YOU MAYBE IF YOU'VE GOT LIKE DEPENDENTS OR THINGS LIKE THAT IT SHOULD BE HIGHER  (fe_03_07738-A-0022)
I JUST DON'T THINK FIVE FIFTEEN IS IS ENOUGH YOU CAN'T  (fe_03_07738-A-0023)
IT'S TOO HARD IF YOU HAVE A CAR PAYMENT THEN A HOUSE AND THEN A FAMILY IT'S FIVE FIFTEEN IS IS NOTHING [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07738-A-0024)
YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0025)
[LAUGHTER] YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0026)
THAT'S TRUE AND THEN IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT REGARDLESS  (fe_03_07738-A-0027)
MHM  (fe_03_07738-A-0028)
YEAH I THINK FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT 'CAUSE SEVEN IS KINDA YOU CAN KINDA GET BY AND EIGHT WOULD BE GOOD  (fe_03_07738-A-0029)
I JUST THINK IT'LL BE TOUGH FOR LIKE THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND WHERE IT'S YOU KNOW THEY HIRE ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S ALL THEY CAN AFFORD GOING UP TO EIGHT DOLLARS WOULD PROBABLY BE TOUGH FOR THEM  (fe_03_07738-A-0030)
MHM  (fe_03_07738-A-0031)
YEAH IT'S KIND OF A NO WIN SITUATION WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT BUT IT'LL BENEFIT MORE PEOPLE TO BE INCREASED TO EIGHT THAN THAN IT WOULD  (fe_03_07738-A-0032)
LIKE YOU KNOW IT WOULD HELP THEM MORE THAN IT WOULD HURT THE SMALL BUSINESSES I THINK  (fe_03_07738-A-0033)
MHM  (fe_03_07738-A-0034)
UH-HUH THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07738-A-0035)
YOU JUMP AT IT YEAH HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN FIVE FIFTEEN  (fe_03_07738-A-0036)
DO YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07738-A-0037)
UH-HUH  (fe_03_07738-A-0038)
I THINK IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS OR SO AND I REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING IT AGAIN BUT NOTHING EVER CAME OF THAT  (fe_03_07738-A-0039)
I WONDER IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT NOW  (fe_03_07738-A-0040)
MHM  (fe_03_07738-A-0041)
YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0042)
YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0043)
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0044)
YEAH [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07738-A-0045)
A PHONE OR YOU'D JUST BE STRUGGLING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK  (fe_03_07738-A-0046)
MHM THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07738-A-0047)
YEAH  (fe_03_07738-A-0048)
PROBABLY ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE  (fe_03_07738-A-0049)
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING I STARTED WORKING WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN AND I WORKED AT A AN AMUSEMENT PARK WHERE IT WAS ONLY OPEN  (fe_03_07738-A-0050)
UM MAYBE SEVEN MONTHS OUTTA THE YEAR  (fe_03_07738-A-0051)
AND THEY WERE SINCE IT WAS SEASONAL THEY WERE ALLOWED TO NOT PAY MINIMUM WAGE AND UM  (fe_03_07738-A-0052)
I I ONLY MADE  (fe_03_07738-A-0053)
I THINK IT WAS TWO SEVENTY FIVE AN HOUR AND I GOT YOU KNOW WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS I GOT A RAISE TO A QUARTER AND I WAS [LAUGHTER] SO EXCITED TO BE MAKING THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND THIS WASN'T TOO LONG AGO IT WAS LIKE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO  (fe_03_07738-A-0054)
YOU KNOW OR LIKE THIRTEEN YEARS AGO AND UH YOU KNOW THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT WELL OF COURSE I DIDN'T HAVE A CAR PAYMENT I DIDN'T LIVE ON MY OWN BUT  (fe_03_07738-A-0055)
I WAS SO EXCITED JUST TO BRING HOME LIKE OVER A HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYCHECK  (fe_03_07738-A-0056)
THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU KNOW MINIMUM WAGE FOR LIKE SOMEBODY IN A TEENAGER WOULD WOULD BE OKAY BUT NOT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE ON YOUR OWN NOT AT ALL  (fe_03_07738-A-0057)
I MEAN IT'S HARD EVEN IF THERE'S LIKE A TWO PERSON  (fe_03_07738-A-0058)
YOU KNOW FAMILY LIKE A HUSBAND A WIFE BOTH WORKING MINIMUM WAGE THAT'S STILL NOT GONNA BE  (fe_03_07738-A-0059)
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE HOUSEHOLD  (fe_03_07738-A-0060)
