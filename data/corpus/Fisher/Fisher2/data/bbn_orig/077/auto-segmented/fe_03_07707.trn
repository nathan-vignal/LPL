DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT  (fe_03_07707-A-0005)
WELL I I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT YOU SAY HONESTY IS NUMBER ONE [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH I I WOULD I WOULD KIND OF  (fe_03_07707-A-0006)
PUT THAT UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF VALUES BUT IT'S IT'S I I WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT MAKES ME THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR PAST [LAUGHTER] WHERE THAT'S BEEN REALLY KEY  (fe_03_07707-A-0007)
YEAH  (fe_03_07707-A-0008)
BUT UM  (fe_03_07707-A-0009)

AND EVERYONE  (fe_03_07707-A-0011)
EVERYONE AT HER  (fe_03_07707-A-0012)
DIVORCE SUPPORT GROUP  (fe_03_07707-A-0013)
EXCEPT FOR HER [LAUGHTER] UM ALL ALL OF THEM WERE GETTING A DIVORCE BECAUSE OF UNFAITHFULNESS WHICH IS DEFINITELY COUPLED WITH HONESTY SO  (fe_03_07707-A-0014)
I I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE SAME SHARED VALUES OF HONESTY AND FAITHFULNESS  (fe_03_07707-A-0015)
UM CERTAINLY COME UNDER ONE OF THE THE KEY THINGS THAT YOU LOOK FOR IN A LIFE PARTNER ALTHOUGH WHEN WHEN I WAS GIVEN THE TOPIC I THINK A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT UM [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07707-A-0016)
THAT'S A GOOD QUALITY THAT'S JUST ONE OF MANY  (fe_03_07707-A-0017)

AND THEY WENT THROUGH A WHOLE SERIES OF QUESTIONS OF WOULD YOU BE A FRIEND WITH WOULD YOU LIVE NEXT DOOR WOULD YOU LET YOUR DAUGHTER MARRY [LAUGHTER] SORTA THING  (fe_03_07707-A-0022)
AND IT WAS INTERESTING THAT YOU KNOW THEY THEY WOULD HAVE CLASSIFICATIONS OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_07707-A-0023)
AND TYPES OF PEOPLE AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE VERY IDEALISTIC WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER YOU KNOW IT SHOULDN'T MATTER  (fe_03_07707-A-0024)
WHAT THE THE PERSON'S RACE IS OR HOW MUCH MONEY THEY EARN OR THE TYPE OF JOB THAT THEY HAVE BUT AS YOU GROW OLDER I THINK YOU BECOME  (fe_03_07707-A-0025)
MORE PRACTICAL I GUESS IS IS THE ONLY THING THAT COMES TO MIND IT ISN'T  (fe_03_07707-A-0026)
THAT YOU COULDN'T FALL IN LOVE WITH AND MARRY SOMEBODY WHO ONE OF THE T- ONE OF THE IDENTIFIED PEOPLE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS A YOU KNOW A A TRASH MAN OR SOMEBODY WHO  (fe_03_07707-A-0027)
YOU KNOW WAS A GARBAGE MAN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ISN'T SO MUCH THAT YOU DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANNA MARRY SOMEONE WHO HAD THAT SORT OF CAREER BUT AS YOU GET OLDER YOU REALIZE WELL IF IF I WERE  (fe_03_07707-A-0028)
THAT PERSON PROBABLY DOESN'T SHARE THE SAME  (fe_03_07707-A-0029)
YOU KNOW IF IF IF THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE HAPPY DOING THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO SHARE THE SAME TYPE OF INTEREST AND AND EDUCATION LEVEL AND GOALS THAT THAT THE OTHER PERSON MIGHT HAVE  (fe_03_07707-A-0030)
