SO I THINK YEAH THAT SOME- SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT AND AND A LOTTA PEOPLE SHOULD I DON'T KNOW MAYBE A PETITION OR SOMETHING  (fe_03_07728-A-0036)
TO MAKE IT CHANGE OR TO FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CONSIDER  (fe_03_07728-A-0037)
INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE MHM  (fe_03_07728-A-0038)

SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT I'M GOOD I'M GOOD IT'S NICE HERE TODAY [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07728-B-0004)
MINIMUM WAGE WHAT DID IT SAY IT WAS BEING INCREASED TO FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR  (fe_03_07728-B-0005)
UM YOU KNOW I WOULD FIND IT VERY HARD TO LIVE ON MINIMUM WAGE I I MEAN I I WE ARE CERTAINLY WE ARE  (fe_03_07728-B-0006)
KINDA ABOVE THAT AND  (fe_03_07728-B-0007)
AND I JUST I REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO MAKE MINIMUM WAGE I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY COULD RAISE A FAMILY ON THAT  (fe_03_07728-B-0008)
YEAH IT'S I IT'S DEFINITELY A POVERTY LEVEL HOWEVER I MEAN THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE LIKE HONG KONG AND  (fe_03_07728-B-0009)
UM IN HONG KONG IT'S YOU KNOW YOUR SKILLS DRIVE THE MARKET YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MARKETABLE SKILLS THEN UM [NOISE] YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PAY 'EM JUST FOR SHOWING UP  (fe_03_07728-B-0010)
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S REALLY RIGHT EITHER [COUGH]  (fe_03_07728-B-0011)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07728-B-0012)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07728-B-0013)
SO AND AND AND I THINK IT'S TRUE I MEAN UH DOES THAT MEAN IT INCLUDES BENEFITS I MEAN THAT'S THE THING WHEN YOU START TELLING EMPLOYERS THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY A CERTAIN EMPLOYEE THIS MUCH THEN WHERE DOES IT STOP  (fe_03_07728-B-0014)
YOU YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM HEY NOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM THIS SORTA BENEFIT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_07728-B-0015)
[NOISE] SEE I DON'T KNOW I I I WE OWN A BUSINESS SO I I LOOK AT IT FROM THE OTHER POINT OF IT WHERE WE DON'T PAY OUR EMPLOYEES MINIMUM WAGE WE GIVE THEM MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07728-B-0016)
BUT UM YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ADDED EXPENSES IN THAT FOR EMPLOYERS FOR YOU KNOW HAVE TO PAY IN THE OTHER HALF OF SOCIAL SECURITY THAT INCREASES YOUR UNEMPLOYMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY IT'S AND THAT PUTS A BIG BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES  (fe_03_07728-B-0017)
SO WHEN YOU'RE DOUBLY TAXING THESE SMALL BUSINESSES THEN YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY PUTTING THEM OUTTA BUSINESS BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE TO RAISE THE PRICE OF COST FOR THEIR GOODS THAT THEY'RE PASSING ON TO THE CONSUMER IT'S JUST THE CONSUMER THAT'S FOOTING THE BILLS  (fe_03_07728-B-0018)
MHM  (fe_03_07728-B-0019)
SO I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH FOR SOMEBODY TO LIVE ON EMPLOYERS HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT I JUST DON'T KNOW IF FORCING SOMEBODY AND SAYING HEY YOU HAVE TO PAY THIS PERSON THIS MUCH IS WHAT IS THE ANSWER  (fe_03_07728-B-0020)
[COUGH] YEAH I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL PROBABLY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO I THINK I MADE FOUR SEVENTY FIVE WAS THE MINIMUM WAGE WHEN I WORKED  (fe_03_07728-B-0021)

UM REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COST OF INFLATION AND THE COST OF LIVING INCREASES THAT HAVE OCCURRED  (fe_03_07728-B-0024)
WELL EXACTLY LOOK AT THE COST OF HOUSES HOUSES HAVE RISEN I MEAN JUST IN MY AREA ALONE IN ONE YEAR OUR HOUSES HAVE RAISED ELEVEN PERCENT  (fe_03_07728-B-0025)
AND WE'RE AND WE'RE JUST RIGHT OUT- RIGHT OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO A REGULAR PERSON COULD NOT AFFORD MY HOUSE MAKING ONE MAKING ONE INCOME ON MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07728-B-0026)
YOU COULDN'T AFFORD A REGULAR HOUSE  (fe_03_07728-B-0027)

UM  (fe_03_07728-B-0031)
WHEN DO THEY SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH I MEAN ARE YOU GONNA GO TO A SMALL BUSINESS AND SAY ALL OF A SUDDEN WELL WE'RE GONNA INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO SEVEN OR EIGHT DOLLARS AN HOUR YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT EITHER WITHOUT ANY SORT OF NOTICE AND WITHOUT YOU KNOW EXPECTING SOME ECONOMIC  (fe_03_07728-B-0032)
PITFALLS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE IMPACTING SMALL BUSINESS WITH THAT  (fe_03_07728-B-0033)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07728-B-0034)
IT IS HARD YEAH I CAN SEE THAT I WAS IN THAT BOAT IT IT IS HARD TO MAKE ENDS MEET BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND STUFF FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY  (fe_03_07728-B-0035)
'CAUSE THERE'S W. I. C. K. AND THERE'S UM FOOD STAMPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN I HAVEN'T QUALIFIED FOR THAT SORT OF STUFF IN A LONG TIME SO I DON'T KNOW BUT I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE WORKING THAT HARD YOU DON'T WANNA HAVE TO RELY ON THAT SORT OF STUFF EITHER  (fe_03_07728-B-0036)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07728-B-0037)
YEAH I THINK THEY SHOULD INCREASE IT BUT I ALSO THINK TOO THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE SKILLS IN ORDER TO BE PAID FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING YOU KNOW I I MEAN  (fe_03_07728-B-0039)
IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF JOB  (fe_03_07728-B-0040)
RIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE A MINIMUM A MINIMUM WAGE THERE IT'S JUST IT'S THE WAY THE MARKET IS THEY THEY HAVE A FLAT TAX THERE AND UM IT'S YOUR SKILLS DRIVE  (fe_03_07728-B-0041)
DRIVE THE MARKET IF YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE SO MUCH IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT MUCH AND NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE RELYING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY OKAY WE'RE ONLY GONNA PAY YOU THIS MINIMUM WAGES THERE'S NO MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07728-B-0042)

YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I ONLY MADE EIGHT HOURS AN HOUR AND I MANAGED TO LIVE ON THAT UM  (fe_03_07728-B-0054)
YOU DO I MEAN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL IMPACT OF HOW IT'S GONNA AFFECT  (fe_03_07728-B-0055)
YOU KNOW IT PUTS A BIG BURDEN ON ON THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND I MEAN EVEN BIGGER BUSINESS OWNERS BUT I DON'T KNOW LIKE BIG CORPORATIONS I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'D AFFECT THEM BUT I FROM OWNING A BUSINESS I COULD SEE WHERE IF WE HAD TO PAY SOMEBODY ANOTHER  (fe_03_07728-B-0056)
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WAS MAKING US THEM ANOTHER THREE FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR OVER A WEEK LONG UM YOU KNOW PAY CHECK FOR A COUPLE OF EMPLOYEES THAT'S A LOTTA MONEY  (fe_03_07728-B-0057)
