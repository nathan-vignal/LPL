I KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE HAVE THAT ONE OF US HAS HEALTH INSURANCE I MEAN I DON'T WORK BUT MY MY HUSBAND UM HE WORKS AND IT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT WE HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE SO THAT WE'RE COVERED [NOISE]  (fe_03_07765-B-0013)
YOU CAN'T YOU REALLY CAN'T WORK  (fe_03_07765-B-0014)
IF YOU'RE A SINGLE PARENT AND YOU'RE NOT COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE OF YOUR KIDS  (fe_03_07765-B-0015)
I THINK THAT KIDS GET SICK [NOISE] AND KIDS GET SICK A LOT  (fe_03_07765-B-0016)
REALLY  (fe_03_07765-B-0017)
HUH  (fe_03_07765-B-0018)
YES YES I KNOW I KNOW AND IT'S EXPENSIVE IT'S VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO PAY YOUR OWN INSURANCE [NOISE] SO  (fe_03_07765-B-0019)
HE HAS FAMILY COVER BEFORE WHEN I WAS WORKING WE EACH HAD OUR OWN HEALTH COVERAGE SO WE PAID THE SINGLE RATE BUT NOW THAT I WAS UM WHEN WE MOVED DOWN HERE I WENT TO SCHOOL SO I WAS PAID TO BE IN THE RESEARCH BENEFITS OF ANY KIND  (fe_03_07765-B-0023)
AND UM AND I'M NOT EVEN WORKING NOW AT ALL I'M STILL FINISHING UP MY DEGREE AND UM [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_07765-B-0024)
WE HAD TO HAVE THE FAMILY COVERAGE TO COVER BOTH OF US AND I BET HE PAYS BI WEEKLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUCKS TO HIS HEALTH INSURANCE  (fe_03_07765-B-0025)
I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE  (fe_03_07765-B-0026)
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER  (fe_03_07765-B-0027)
UM WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY A DEDUCTIBLE  (fe_03_07765-B-0028)
UM ONLY IF WE USE SOMETHING OUT OF NETWORK BUT UM IT'S NOT AN H._M._O. AND THE CO PAY THE OFFICES AT CO PAY IS TWENTY DOLLARS  (fe_03_07765-B-0029)
AND THE DRUGS FOR CO PAY IT'S JUST CHANGED AND I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THERE'S TWO TIERS OF DRUG CO PAY THERE'S IF YOU ORDER A MAIL ORDER YOU GET YOU PAY LIKE A FIFTEEN DOLLAR CO PAY FOR  (fe_03_07765-B-0030)
FOR EACH YOU PAY LIKE THIRTY DOLLARS FOR THREE MONTHS I THINK IS WHAT IT ENDS UP BEING  (fe_03_07765-B-0031)
UM IF YOU HAVE RECURRING PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEN IF YOU GET A GENERIC I THINK IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS EACH PRESCRIPTION AND THEN I THINK IF YOU GET A NAMED DRUG IT'S UP TO TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY  (fe_03_07765-B-0032)
SO I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER NEITHER ONE OF US TAKES ANY REGULAR DRUGS THOUGH OR REGULAR PRESCRIPTIONS SO IT HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE FOR ME THE CO PAY WITH THE DRUGS BECAUSE [SIGH] WE USE THEM FOR UM  (fe_03_07765-B-0033)
SO THAT THE INSURANCE WILL STILL COVER IT  (fe_03_07765-B-0037)
YEAH YEAH  (fe_03_07765-B-0038)
YEAH  (fe_03_07765-B-0039)
UH BUT NO NO ALLERGIES HERE EITHER NO WE'RE WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT WAY  (fe_03_07765-B-0040)
BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_07765-B-0042)
NO I DIDN'T EITHER  (fe_03_07765-B-0043)
I DIDN'T EITHER IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED ON MY LIFE  (fe_03_07765-B-0044)
I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE OTHER THAN I'M GLAD I DON'T WORK FOR IT OF COURSE I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAY THAT SEEING AS I DON'T WORK AT ALL AND I DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY THE MINIMUM WAGE WOULD STILL BE A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER WHATEVER SALARY I'M BRINGING IN NOW AT ZERO  (fe_03_07765-B-0045)
WE ENDED UP ACTUALLY IT ENDED UP BEING A REALLY INTERESTING AND LONGER DISCUSSION AND EASIER FOR THE CONVERSATION TO FLOW BECAUSE SHE KEPT ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOCKEY AND WE ENDED UP HAVING A BIG LONG TALK ABOUT HOCKEY [NOISE]  (fe_03_07765-B-0055)
MHM  (fe_03_07765-B-0056)
THIS IS MY THIRD ALSO  (fe_03_07765-B-0057)
BUT UM I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07765-B-0058)
MHM  (fe_03_07765-B-0059)
YEAH BUT IT'S ONE THING IF THE PERSON WHO'S WORKING THERE IS UM RETIRED SUPPLEMENTING THEIR INCOME IF THEY'RE SIXTEEN GETTING SPENDING MONEY OR IF THEY'RE A SINGLE PARENT TRYING TO SUPPORT THREE KIDS  (fe_03_07765-B-0060)
I THINK THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE  (fe_03_07765-B-0061)
OH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IF YOU NEEDED THE MONEY AND THEY WERE GONNA HIRE YOU YOU WOULD WORK THERE HAPPILY FOR WHATEVER THEY PAY YOU  (fe_03_07765-B-0062)
YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER HALF OF THE EQUATION IS THOUGH  (fe_03_07765-B-0063)
IF YOU SET THE MINIMUM WAGE YOU START INFLUENCING THE MARKET AND THE MARKET SHOULD HAVE TO PAY WHATEVER WAGE  (fe_03_07765-B-0064)
WILL BE WILL WILL BEAR THAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR SO IF WORKERS WON'T WORK FOR THE WAGES THEY'RE PAYING THEN THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE  (fe_03_07765-B-0065)
BUT I THINK A BUSINESS OWNER SHOULD HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN DETERMINING WHAT WAGE THEY WANNA PAY I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_07765-B-0066)
AND THEN WHEN THEY HIRE PEOPLE THAT ARE ARE CRAPPY EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE CRAPPY WAGES THAT THEY'LL PAY THEM THEIR BUSINESS WILL BE RUN INTO THE GROUND  (fe_03_07765-B-0067)
I COULD'VE GOT ONE TODAY I WAS IN A STORE AND THERE WAS A BIG SIGN LOTS OF MALL JOBS THE MALL'S HIRING I MEAN IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE A JOB  (fe_03_07765-B-0068)
BUT THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THING I MEAN YOU KNOW LIKE WITH ME I'M AN ENGINEER I MEAN FOR ME TO GO WORK IN THE MALL I CAN'T BE WORKING FULL TIME TO FIND A JOB AS AN ENGINEER IF I'M WORKING IN THE MALL  (fe_03_07765-B-0069)
AND I WOULD MUCH PREFER TO WORK AS AN ENGINEER THAT'S WHAT I LOVE TO DO  (fe_03_07765-B-0070)
SO AND THAT'S WHAT I STUDY I'M WORKING ON MY MY DOCTORATE AND WHEN I GET DONE I DON'T WANNA YOU KNOW GO WORK AT THE MALL BUT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ME GOING TO WORK AT THE MALL WHILE I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB SO THAT I UH  (fe_03_07765-B-0071)
YEAH BUT I I DON'T WORK AT ALL THOUGH  (fe_03_07765-B-0073)
