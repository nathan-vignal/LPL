HI I'M ADAM  (fe_03_07717-A-0001)
NICE TO MEET YOU UM [MN] I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE PARTNERS IS AH COMPATIBILITY IN AS MANY AREAS AS POSSIBLE  (fe_03_07717-A-0003)
WELL WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT'S PART OF COMPATIBILITY  (fe_03_07717-A-0004)
[MN] BUT WHAT IF AH IN YOUR COMMUNICATION YOU REALISE THAT YOU'RE NOT COMPATIBLE IN  (fe_03_07717-A-0005)
CERTAIN KEY AREAS  (fe_03_07717-A-0006)
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE  (fe_03_07717-A-0007)
OH NO PROBLEM  (fe_03_07717-A-0008)
UM [MN]  (fe_03_07717-A-0009)
AH THIRTY  (fe_03_07717-A-0011)
REALLY UM UM WHAT CAUSED THOSE AH THAT ONE THAT ENDED TO END  (fe_03_07717-A-0012)
WAS THAT COMMUNICATION  (fe_03_07717-A-0013)
OH BUT WAS IT A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM  (fe_03_07717-A-0014)
OKAY SO THEN WHY DO YOU THINK COMMUNICATION'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING  (fe_03_07717-A-0015)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-A-0016)
[NOISE] OH THAT'S VERY INTERESTING WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE NEED TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT [NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-A-0020)
MHM  (fe_03_07717-A-0022)
YEAH BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP  (fe_03_07717-A-0023)
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE FIRST DATING THOUGH ONCE YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE FOR A WHILE I THINK THAT THE WALLS COME DOWN ON THAT  (fe_03_07717-A-0024)
'CAUSE THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARGUE ABOUT THINGS AND DISCUSS THINGS 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN A RELATIONSHIP [NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-A-0025)
WELL WHAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF A RELATIONSHIP  (fe_03_07717-A-0026)
OKAY [NOISE] SO AT WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT AH  (fe_03_07717-A-0028)
PEOPLE CAN STOP TRYING TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT OR SHOULD STOP TRYING TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT  (fe_03_07717-A-0029)
I SEE SO THE FIRST TIME YOU WOULD EVER MEET SOMEONE YOU WOULD JUST LAY IT ALL OUT  (fe_03_07717-A-0032)
SO HAS THAT CAUSED YOU ANY PROBLEMS IN THE PAST [NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-A-0033)
I SEE  (fe_03_07717-A-0035)
SO HAS AH BEING UP FRONT CAUSED YOU ANY PROBLEMS  (fe_03_07717-A-0036)
[NOISE] I SEE  (fe_03_07717-A-0038)
AH I TRY TO BE AS UP FRONT AS POSSIBLE  (fe_03_07717-A-0039)
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL BUT AH  (fe_03_07717-A-0040)
I THINK THAT WHEN YOU FIRST MEET SOMEONE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE UP FRONT WITH THEM ABOUT EVERYTHING  (fe_03_07717-A-0041)
LIKE YOU CAN'T IN YOUR FIRST MEETING WITH SOMEONE OR YOUR FIRST SEVERAL MEETINGS YOU CAN'T GET TO KNOW SOMEONE COMPLETELY IF YOU'RE AT ODDS WITH THEM THE WHOLE TIME OR TELLING THEM  (fe_03_07717-A-0042)
[MN] YEAH THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_07717-A-0044)
[MN] THAT'S TRUE [NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-A-0045)
BUT BACK TO COMPATIBILITY  (fe_03_07717-A-0047)
WHICH IS THE OTHER THING THAT YOU AH YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT THOUGH  (fe_03_07717-A-0048)
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE AH ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE IN COMMON [NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-A-0050)
OKAY  (fe_03_07717-A-0053)
OKAY SO YOU THINK THAT AH SOMEONE WHO YEARNS TO BE EDUCATED WHO FOR INSTANCE MAYBE READS A LOT COULDN'T BE WITH SOMEONE WHO JUST LIKES TO WATCH T._V. ALL DAY  (fe_03_07717-A-0055)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07717-A-0057)
THAT MAKES SENSE NOW HERE'S SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT AH  (fe_03_07717-A-0059)
SLIGHTLY LESS IN DEPTH WOULD BE JUST TO SHARE INTERESTS IN THE SAME LEISURE ACTIVITIES  (fe_03_07717-A-0060)
WHICH  (fe_03_07717-A-0061)
THAT WOULD BE ESSENTIAL IN MY OPINION  (fe_03_07717-A-0062)
IF YOU AH  (fe_03_07717-A-0063)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07717-A-0064)
OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO DO  (fe_03_07717-A-0065)
LIKE  (fe_03_07717-A-0066)
I'D SAY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE KEY COMPONENT  (fe_03_07717-A-0067)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_07717-A-0068)
WELL IT MIGHTN'T BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A AH RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH ANYWAY SO  (fe_03_07717-A-0069)

I THINK IT COULD BE BUT [NOISE] IF YOU AREN'T IF EVEN IF YOU AREN'T COMPATIBLE EVEN IF YOU DON'T ENJOY ALL OF THE SAME THINGS OR HAVE ALL OF THE SAME INTERESTS  (fe_03_07717-B-0005)
YOU CAN STILL GET ALONG WELL AS LONG AS YOU COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER  (fe_03_07717-B-0006)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-B-0007)
I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAPPEN [NOISE] PRETTY EARLY ON  (fe_03_07717-B-0008)

THEY'RE TOO AFRAID TO TOUCH CERTAIN AREAS BECAUSE THEY MIGHT OFFEND SOMEONE WELL YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07717-B-0031)
OH NO I THINK PEOPLE DO IN A RELATIONSHIP TOO THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING WRONG  (fe_03_07717-B-0032)
AND THE OTHER PERSON WILL TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY AND WALK OUT  (fe_03_07717-B-0033)
I THINK IT'S STILL THERE A LITTLE BIT BUT [NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-B-0036)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07717-B-0037)
I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT A PERSON'S VIEW OF A RELATIONSHIP IS UM YEAH  (fe_03_07717-B-0038)
