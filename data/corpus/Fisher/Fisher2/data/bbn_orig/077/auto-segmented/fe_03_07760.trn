HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS EVENING  (fe_03_07760-A-0002)
PRETTY GOOD I WOULDN'T NORMALLY BE CALLING THIS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT BUT I'M GETTING READY TO RUN GRANDMA'S MARATHON TOMORROW MORNING  (fe_03_07760-A-0003)

YEAH  (fe_03_07760-A-0015)

YEAH [LAUGHTER] I AGREE UM I ALSO TEACH ECONOMICS SO I'VE SEEN YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT ON MINIMUM WAGES AS WELL [SIGH] THAT UM  (fe_03_07760-A-0017)
YOU KNOW IN TIMES WHEN THINGS ARE GOING GREAT  (fe_03_07760-A-0018)
NOBODY GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE ANYWAY SO IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER UM [LIPSMACK] BUT THE OPPOSITE ARGUMENT IS THAT IN TIMES OF WEAKNESS LIKE WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_07760-A-0019)
IS THE MINIMUM WAGE CAUSING PEOPLE TO BE OUT OF WORK THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE EMPLOYED IF YOU KNOW IF THEY COULD EARN SAY FOUR SEVENTY FIVE AN HOUR  (fe_03_07760-A-0020)
AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT I HAVE MY STUDENTS DISCUSS  (fe_03_07760-A-0021)
NO IT'S ACTUALLY FIVE FIFTEEN  (fe_03_07760-A-0022)
BUT  (fe_03_07760-A-0023)
YEAH BUT  (fe_03_07760-A-0024)
BUT YOU KNOW IF IT WAS LOWER COULD YOU BE EMPLOYING MORE PEOPLE  (fe_03_07760-A-0025)
INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS FLOOR AND SAYING THAT YOU KNOW LOOK YOU HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST THIS MUCH  (fe_03_07760-A-0026)
MHM  (fe_03_07760-A-0027)
YEAH  (fe_03_07760-A-0028)
MHM  (fe_03_07760-A-0029)
WELL WE'RE KINDA SPLIT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE JUST ENTERING THE WORKFORCE THEY HAVE PART TIME JOBS AND THEY MAKE THAT AMOUNT  (fe_03_07760-A-0030)
YEAH AND THEY THINK IT'S ADEQUATE FOR THEM  (fe_03_07760-A-0031)
SO YOU KNOW FOR THEM IT'S OKAY BUT YOU KNOW FAMILIES WORKING IT PROBABLY ISN'T OKAY I MEAN FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR WHAT IS THAT TEN THOUSAND BUCKS A YEAR  (fe_03_07760-A-0032)
YEAH  (fe_03_07760-A-0035)
MHM [MN] YEAH YEAH AND THAT'S THAT'S A SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT I USUALLY COME DOWN ON AS WELL [MN] I MEAN IT'S ONE THING TO GIVE A TRAINING WAGE OR TO GIVE KIDS THIS WAGE  (fe_03_07760-A-0036)
UM  (fe_03_07760-A-0037)
AND YOU KNOW IF IF ADULTS WANNA EARN THAT FINE BUT IF THEY WANNA DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR LIVES YOU GO AT IT  (fe_03_07760-A-0038)
DON'T COMPLAIN TO DON'T COMPLAIN  (fe_03_07760-A-0039)
MHM  (fe_03_07760-A-0040)
[MN] YEAH AND THAT'S YOU KNOW YEAH IT IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY LEFT THE QUESTION THAT NARROW  (fe_03_07760-A-0042)
UM  (fe_03_07760-A-0043)
BECAUSE IF THEY SAID YOU KNOW IS THE MINIMUM WAGE RIGHT OR NOT  (fe_03_07760-A-0044)
THAT PROBABLY YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE OPENED IT UP FOR MUCH MORE DISCUSSION  (fe_03_07760-A-0045)
YEAH  (fe_03_07760-A-0046)
MHM  (fe_03_07760-A-0047)
YEAH  (fe_03_07760-A-0048)
WELL  (fe_03_07760-A-0049)
LET ME ASK YOU THIS UM  (fe_03_07760-A-0050)
YOU KNOW IT'S A FEDERAL LAW  (fe_03_07760-A-0051)
UM I GOT OUT OF BUSINESS SCHOOL ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND MOST OF MY FRIENDS COMING OUT OF THERE WERE TAKING CONSULTING JOBS IT DIDN'T MATTER WHERE YOU WENT IN THE COUNTRY THEY WERE PAYING YOU THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY  (fe_03_07760-A-0052)
Y- YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT THE COST OF LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY IS EQUAL TO THE COST OF LIVING IN THE TWIN CITIES  (fe_03_07760-A-0054)
SO IS IT REALLY FAIR TO HAVE A FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OR SHOULD THERE BE DIFFERENT MINIMUM WAGES FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY  (fe_03_07760-A-0055)
OKAY  (fe_03_07760-A-0056)
WELL  (fe_03_07760-A-0060)
NO  (fe_03_07760-A-0061)
YEAH AN- AND THEN YOU COME DOWN TO THE PLAN OF HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT SHOULD BE  (fe_03_07760-A-0062)
AND [MN] YOU GET POLITICIANS INVOLVED IN THAT IT'S GETTING [MN] EVEN BIGGER MESS MHM  (fe_03_07760-A-0063)
MEAN CONSIDERING THE TOPIC I THINK WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB UM AS FAR AS DISCUSSING SOME OF THE MERITS THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE DISCUSSED UM [MN]  (fe_03_07760-A-0067)
I REALLY DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE A MINIMUM WAGE PERIOD I THINK IT SHOULD BE UP TO PRIVATE PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH PEOPLE WANNA GET PAID UM  (fe_03_07760-A-0068)
YOU KNOW [MN] REALLY IT'S ALMOST LIKE RENT CONTROLS IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE YOU CAP THE AMOUNT OF RENT THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE PAYING YOU YOU GOVERNMENT PRICE CONTROLS DO NOT WORK IN THE LONG RUN  (fe_03_07760-A-0069)
UM  (fe_03_07760-A-0070)
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GONNA FIND WAYS TO CHEAT IT JUST LIKE WITH THE INCOME TAX CODE EVERY TIME A NEW TAX PACKAGE IS PASSED ACCOUNTANTS LAWYERS ET CETERA COME UP WITH WAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET AROUND IT  (fe_03_07760-A-0071)

YOU KNOW IT'S THERE ARE THAT THAT'S JUST IT THERE ARE JOBS OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07760-B-0017)
I DON'T KNOW PERSONALLY I GUESS I THINK THAT FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR FOR STARTING YOU KNOW IT IT THERE HAS TO BE A BASELINE  (fe_03_07760-B-0018)
IT'S BEEN INCREASING OVER THE YEARS UM IF THEY WANNA DECREASE TAXES INSTEAD OF INCREASE [NOISE] MINIMUM WAGE THAT WOULD HELP EVERYBODY  (fe_03_07760-B-0019)
[LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07760-B-0020)

IT IS FIVE FIFTEEN O- I I COULDN'T EVEN HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IT WAS YEAH  (fe_03_07760-B-0028)
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I MEAN THE WAY I WOULD THINK ABOUT THAT IS IT DEPENDS ON WHO THE PEOPLE ARE  (fe_03_07760-B-0029)
AND OKAY IF YOU HIRE YOU KNOW TWO PEOPLE AT FOUR SEVENTY FIVE AND YES NOW YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE UM  (fe_03_07760-B-0030)
BUT YOU HAVE SOMEBODY AT FIVE FIFTEEN  (fe_03_07760-B-0031)
[NOISE] I GUESS I'M TH- I'M THINKING MORE THE QUALITY OF THE WORKER  (fe_03_07760-B-0032)
VERSUS YOU KNOW [MN] ONE AGAINST TWO SOMETIMES DOESN'T MAKE  (fe_03_07760-B-0033)

IF THEY DON'T GIVE IT THEIR ALL AND TRY TO MAKE MORE THEY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE SO WHY SHOULD THEY BE SUPPLEMENTED AS YOU KNOW WITHOUT MERIT  (fe_03_07760-B-0044)
YEAH  (fe_03_07760-B-0046)
RIGHT  (fe_03_07760-B-0047)

BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO DECIDE THEIR OWN WAGES WOULD MOST PEOPLE I MEAN I KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESSES [SIGH] AND THEY DON'T START AT MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE THEY DO WANT TO ATTRACT [NOISE] HIGHER QUALITY WORKERS  (fe_03_07760-B-0058)
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO START AT THE MINIMUM WAGE I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE YOUR FACTORY WORKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT UH I YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07760-B-0059)

RIGHT  (fe_03_07760-B-0062)
NO I I DON'T THINK THAT I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK SO ON THAT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE ONE MINIMUM WAGE AND THE REASON I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THE THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SAID YOU MUST WORK HERE YOU MUST LIVE HERE  (fe_03_07760-B-0063)
IF PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY LIVE IN NEW YORK AND AND THEY'RE STILL LIVING THERE KNOWING THAT UM THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET SOMEPLACE ELSE AND LIVE SOMEPLACE ELSE FOR A LOT LESS I MEAN I LIVE IN ATLANTA FOR A REASON  (fe_03_07760-B-0064)
AND PART OF THE REASON IS THE COST OF LIVING IT IS FAIRLY INEXPENSIVE I HAD BEEN ASKED WITH MY JOB TO BE MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO [SIGH] I SAID SURE FIND ME A TWO HUNDRED AND YOU KNOW FIND ME A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOUSE  (fe_03_07760-B-0065)
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE COST IS JUST FIND ME A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOUSE AND AND I'LL MOVE IN  (fe_03_07760-B-0066)
BUT I'M NOT LOWERING MY STANDARDS JUST TO MOVE SOMEPLACE ELSE SO SEE IT WAS MY CHOICE AND AND AGAIN I THINK THE SAME THING [SIGH]  (fe_03_07760-B-0067)
THERE THERE'S A A FEDERAL RULE  (fe_03_07760-B-0068)
BUT JUST BECAUSE  (fe_03_07760-B-0069)
UM IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN ONE PLACE ANOTH- EVEN IN ATLANTA IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN THE CITY OF ATLANTA AS OPPOSED TO THE SUBURBS SO SHOULD THE CITY OF ATLANTA BE A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE PAY  (fe_03_07760-B-0070)
