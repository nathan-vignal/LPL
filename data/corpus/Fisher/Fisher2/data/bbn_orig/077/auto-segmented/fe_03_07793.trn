MHM  (fe_03_07793-A-0013)
I THINK ALSO IT IT PROBABLY HAS TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE CONTEXT UM  (fe_03_07793-A-0014)
IN WHICH SOMETHING IS BROUGHT UP  (fe_03_07793-A-0015)
IF YOU'RE GONNA INTO A STAND UP ROUTINE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE IN FOR COMEDY AND ALSO BE OR WHATEVER BUT IF IN TERMS OF TELLING STORIES OR BRINGING UP SOMETHING  (fe_03_07793-A-0017)
[SIGH] IT'S DEFINITELY A JUDGMENT CALL WHETHER THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM ARE GONNA BE OFFENDED OR NOT OR YOU KNOW IF IT JUST MUST BE TOLD AND THE UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF IT IS  (fe_03_07793-A-0018)
NOT AS STRONG AS THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATING THE STORY [LAUGHTER] I GUESS  (fe_03_07793-A-0019)

OH YEAH  (fe_03_07793-A-0022)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_07793-A-0023)
'CAUSE I THINK PERSONALLY I TEND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BE EMBARRASSED AND THEN  (fe_03_07793-A-0024)
BUT THEN IT'S EASY TO ASSUME THAT OTHER PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT I DO  (fe_03_07793-A-0025)
SO  (fe_03_07793-A-0026)
PEOPLE MIGHT BE OFFENDED AND YOU NEVER KNOW AND YOU WALK AWAY HAPPY AS CAN BE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07793-A-0027)

I WAS AT A BREAKFAST WITH A A BUNCH OF GIRLFRIENDS AND IT WAS ACTUALLY A BRIDAL SHOWER BRUNCH  (fe_03_07793-A-0032)

TO GUESS [LIPSMACK]  (fe_03_07793-A-0034)
IT HAD TO DO WITH THEY HA- WE HAD TO TELL A TRUE EMBARRASSING STORY AND AND WHEN I WENT TO TELL MY STORY IT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE TABLE BUT IT WAS  (fe_03_07793-A-0035)
HAD TO BE TOLD FOR THAT MOMENT [LAUGHTER] IT WAS SO FUNNY  (fe_03_07793-A-0036)
SO UM I TOLD EVERYONE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INAPPROPRIATE BUT IT HAD TO BE TOLD AND SO I TOLD IT AND [MN]  (fe_03_07793-A-0037)

[SIGH] MM MM WHAT ELSE COULD BE SAID ABOUT THAT TOPIC  (fe_03_07793-A-0040)
WELL  (fe_03_07793-A-0041)
I WAS ACTUALLY  (fe_03_07793-A-0042)
THINKING IN TERMS OF STAND UP COMEDY ROUTINES AND THINGS WE WERE WATCHING  (fe_03_07793-A-0043)
MY BOYFRIEND AND I WERE WATCHING AN OLD BILL COSBY ROUTINE AND IT WAS HILARIOUS AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY VULGAR WORDS IT HE HE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE AND IT WAS HYSTERICAL  (fe_03_07793-A-0044)
AND IT SEEMS THAT COMEDIANS NOWADAYS  (fe_03_07793-A-0045)
TEND TO  (fe_03_07793-A-0046)
[LIPSMACK] RELY MORE UPON SHOCK VALUE  (fe_03_07793-A-0047)
[LIPSMACK] OR MORE VULGAR OR SEXUALLY ORIENTED MATERIAL  (fe_03_07793-A-0048)
UM IN ORDER TO TO MAKE THEMSELVES STAND OUT AND JUST SHOCK PEOPLE INTO LAUGHING I THINK BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW COMEDIANS THAT HAVE GOOD CLEAN FUNNY HUMOR AND I THINK IT'S JUST BECAUSE  (fe_03_07793-A-0049)
IN THE CYCLES OF INNOVATION PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO SHOCK  (fe_03_07793-A-0050)
AND SURPRISE THE AUDIENCE AND THEN THAT TURNS IT INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LESS TASTEFUL  (fe_03_07793-A-0051)
BUT THAT'S MY OPINION AND I MEAN IT'S LIKE THAT'S MY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW  (fe_03_07793-A-0052)

THE STANDARDS HAVE SHIFTED SO QUICKLY  (fe_03_07793-A-0068)
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS I MEAN IT HASN'T BEEN  (fe_03_07793-A-0069)
I AM NOT THAT OLD BUT I MEAN  (fe_03_07793-A-0070)
IT SEEMS THAT IF WE'VE SEEN A SHARP INCREASE OF WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON T._V. IT DOESN'T REALLY EXCLUDE ANYTHING AT THIS POINT  (fe_03_07793-A-0071)
AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT FUNNY WHAT'S CONSIDERED COMEDY  (fe_03_07793-A-0072)
THE SITCOMS AND THINGS NOT EVEN IN TERMS OF APPROPRIATE OR NOT BUT SOME OF 'EM ARE JUST NOT FUNNY THEY'RE REALLY PREDICTABLE JOKES AND UM  (fe_03_07793-A-0074)
PREDICTABLE FOLLOW UP LINES AND THE LAUGH TRACKS AND TELL YOU WHEN TO LAUGH SO THAT YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT THAT FUNNY AND N- OR ENTERTAINING MOST OF THE TIME  (fe_03_07793-A-0075)

IT'S IT'S JUST LIKE THE OTHER REALITY SHOWS IN THAT EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO BE EVALUATED AND SOMEBODY GETS ELIMINATED AND GOES TO THE NEXT ROUND AND BUT IT'S BASED ON  (fe_03_07793-A-0089)
[LIPSMACK] IT'S MORE OF A PERSONALITY AND A SKILL BASED REALITY SHOW THAN ALL OF THESE SORT OF SCRIPTED  (fe_03_07793-A-0090)
THE DATING ONES THAT I DON'T EVER BELIEVE IN THE FIRST PLACE [LAUGHTER] UH IT'S IT'S A SORT OF REFRESHING TWIST ON THE SAME OLD  (fe_03_07793-A-0091)
