UM  (fe_03_07719-B-0065)
ALSO LIKE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS  (fe_03_07719-B-0066)
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO RELY ON EACH OTHER FOR EVERYTHING EVERYDAY  (fe_03_07719-B-0067)
YOU'RE ABLE TO KIND OF STILL LIVE YOUR OWN LIVES EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TOGETHER SO TO SPEAK  (fe_03_07719-B-0068)
AND I THINK THAT FOR BOTH OF YOU TO BE  (fe_03_07719-B-0069)
INDEPENDENT KEEPS YOU  (fe_03_07719-B-0070)
CONNECTED  (fe_03_07719-B-0071)
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IF ONE PERSON FEELS LIKE THE OTHER PERSON NEEDS THEM TO GET BY EVERY DAY THEN THERE'S A PROBLEM  (fe_03_07719-B-0072)
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF DIVORCES AND AND BREAK UPS OCCUR IS BECAUSE OF THAT  (fe_03_07719-B-0073)
YOU LOSE YOUR INDEPENDENCE AND YOUR SELF  (fe_03_07719-B-0074)
AND IF YOU HAVE TO RELY ON ANYBODY ELSE BESIDES YOURSELF THEN I THINK PEOPLE REALLY START TO WONDER ABOUT YOU  (fe_03_07719-B-0075)

OF COURSE WHEN THEY'RE DATING THEY WOULD MAKE THEMSELVES LOOK PRETTY OR WHATEVER AND THEN  (fe_03_07719-B-0080)
THEY START YOU KNOW GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE OR GETTING THEY GET MARRIED AND THEY KIND OF DON'T BOTHER WITH THEIR HAIR AND MAKE UP AND THEY KIND OF DON'T CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES AFTER A WHILE  (fe_03_07719-B-0081)
AND THEY DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A FACTOR BUT I THINK IT'S A DEFINITE FACTOR IN THAT EQUATION  (fe_03_07719-B-0082)

BECAUSE I MEAN I I'M SO AWARE OF THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS THAT YOU GO THROUGH AND THE ESSENCE OF COMMUNICATION THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY THE KEY IT REALLY IS  (fe_03_07719-B-0098)
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMMUNICATION YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH  (fe_03_07719-B-0099)
