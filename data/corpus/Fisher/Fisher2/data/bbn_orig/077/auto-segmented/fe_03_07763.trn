THAT IS GREAT  (fe_03_07763-B-0009)
GREAT I I KNOW THAT HERE IN ILLINOIS THEY HAVE THEY'RE THEY ARE I THINK THERE'S A BILL IN THE CONGRESS TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07763-B-0010)
AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS DESPERATELY NEEDS TO HAPPEN  (fe_03_07763-B-0011)
I FEEL BECAUSE UM IT'S I- WITH EVERYTHING INCREASING WITH GASOLINE INCREASING IN PRICE AND AND YOU KNOW FOOD INCREASING AND AND AND RENT AND EVERYTHING INCREASING IN OUR AREA I FEEL IT'S NECESSARY  (fe_03_07763-B-0012)
JUST TO HAVE IT UM INCREASED JUST SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE  (fe_03_07763-B-0013)
FIVE FIFTEEN  (fe_03_07763-B-0014)
I THINK IS WHERE IT STARTED AT  (fe_03_07763-B-0015)
YEAH AND SEE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IN IN UH SAN DIEGO BUT HERE IN ILLINOIS THEY DID AWAY WITH THE WHOLE D._C._S._S. PROGRAM AND IT WAS A PROGRAM WHERE YOU KNOW SINGLE MOMS COULD GET MONEY  (fe_03_07763-B-0016)
AND LIVING EXPENSES AND AND FOOD STAMPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY'VE DONE AWAY WITH ALL THIS  (fe_03_07763-B-0017)
SO THAT THERE IS NO MORE CASE WORKERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT DEALING WITH IT THEY HAD A UM  (fe_03_07763-B-0018)
T- TO WORK PROGRAM WHERE IN A YEAR THEY WOULD SEND YOU TO SCHOOL OR DO WHATEVER YOU HAD BUT IN A YEAR YOU HAD TO F- UH WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME YOU HAD TO HAVE A JOB  (fe_03_07763-B-0019)
YOU KNOW SO A LOT OF THE WOMEN WENT TO WORK FOR BURGER KING AND WERE WERE UM YOU KNOW IT IT CAME UP ON THAT  (fe_03_07763-B-0020)
YOU KNOW THE BARE NECESSITIES THEY WERE NOT EVEN PROVIDED FOR THE GIRL BROUGHT IN PAPERWORK SAYING YOU KNOW TO A CASE WORKER  (fe_03_07763-B-0021)
THIS IS HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO LIVE AND THIS IS WITHOUT A PHONE OR A CAR AND THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY WILL COME IN IF I WORK AT BURGER KING AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY  (fe_03_07763-B-0022)
AND IT ENDED UP THE GIRL LOST HER APARTMENT AND ALL OF HER FURNISHINGS AND EVERYTHING AND HAD TO BE HOMELESS  (fe_03_07763-B-0023)
AND SO I I YOU KNOW WITH THAT STORY I REMEMBER AND IT WAS A TRUE STORY I REALLY TRULY BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY HAVE TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY JUST TO SURVIVE  (fe_03_07763-B-0024)
WHAT IS THE PRICE OF YOUR GAS OUT THERE MM  (fe_03_07763-B-0025)
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT IT IS HERE IT'S LIKE ONE FIFTY SEVEN IF YOU GO TO MORE OF THE EXPENSIVE PLACES IT'S ONE SIXTY FIVE  (fe_03_07763-B-0026)

IT'S REALLY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MINIMUM WAGE IT REALLY AFFECTS EVERYBODY  (fe_03_07763-B-0030)
UM I MEAN BEFORE PEOPLE USED TO LIVE WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO  (fe_03_07763-B-0031)
YOU KNOW THEY THEY MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE AND AND AND STARTED THEIR OWN FAMILIES AND IT USED TO BE REMEMBER HOW MOM STAYED AT HOME AND [LAUGHTER] NOW IT'S  (fe_03_07763-B-0032)
NOW IT'S A TWO PAY CHECK FAMILY AND EVEN WITH TWO PAY CHECKS IF THAT SOMETIMES ISN'T ENOUGH TO TO SUPPORT A FAMILY OF THREE OR FOUR  (fe_03_07763-B-0033)
YEAH SO I I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS UM INCREASE NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND WASN'T THERE A WOMAN  (fe_03_07763-B-0034)
THAT UM SHE WENT UNDERCOVER AND TRIED TO LIVE IN ONE OF THESE TOWNS ONE OF THESE SMALL TOWNS AND LIVE ON MINIMUM WAGE AND SHE SAID IT WAS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE  (fe_03_07763-B-0035)
YOU KNOW  (fe_03_07763-B-0036)

MHM  (fe_03_07763-B-0038)

YEAH AND THEN A LOT OF THE FAMILIES UM THAT ARE DOING MINIMUM WAGE ARE UM IN OUR AREA A LOT OF THE MEXICAN FAMILIES  (fe_03_07763-B-0040)
WHO HAVE COME ACROSS THE BORDER TO WORK BECAUSE IN OUR AREA WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TEENAGERS THAT WOULD ACCEPT JOBS  (fe_03_07763-B-0041)
YOU KNOW AT MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07763-B-0042)
SO UM WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A CRUNCH GOING ON WHERE AND THEN IF THESE IN IN ILLINOIS I THINK OVER FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FAMILIES HAVE DIVORCED  (fe_03_07763-B-0043)
SO WOMEN WHO WERE UM TAKEN CARE OF AND HAD A HUSBAND THAT WENT T- TO TO HIS JOB AND SHE STAYED AT HOME AND AND TOOK CARE OF THE HOUSE AND THE CHILDREN SHE'S NOW FACED WITH FINDING A JOB  (fe_03_07763-B-0044)
SO WE HAVE THESE DISPLACED HOMEMAKERS ALSO WHO ARE OUT THERE AND AND SO MUCH OF THE THE STRESSES ON WOMEN NOW BECAUSE OF THE MEN NOT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT HERE IN ILLINOIS  (fe_03_07763-B-0045)
I MEAN  (fe_03_07763-B-0046)
