[NOISE] IT'S NOT WORTH IT I MEAN I I KNOW I LIVE IN A A VERY RURAL ENVIRONMENT AND  (fe_03_07756-B-0027)
THE GAS MONEY ALONE IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS  (fe_03_07756-B-0028)
SO  (fe_03_07756-B-0029)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07756-B-0030)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07756-B-0031)

UM  (fe_03_07756-B-0052)
BUT YEAH FIVE FIFTEEN AN HOUR IS JUST WAY TO LOW  (fe_03_07756-B-0053)
IF IT'S TRANSITIONED IT SHOULD BE  (fe_03_07756-B-0056)
I WOULD THINK STARTING PROBABLY ABOUT SIX FIFTY  (fe_03_07756-B-0057)
WHICH WOULD GIVE BUSINESSES UM  (fe_03_07756-B-0058)
OVER A COURSE OF A TWO YEAR PERIOD TO  (fe_03_07756-B-0059)
TO GET ADJUSTED TO IT BEFORE AN INCREASE WOULD TAKE EFFECT AGAIN  (fe_03_07756-B-0060)
AND IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST SEVEN DOLLARS IF NOT LO- UH HIGHER  (fe_03_07756-B-0061)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07756-B-0062)
YEAH IT'S FED- IT'S UH FEDERALLY MANDATED SO THAT'S THE BARE MINIMUM THAT SOMEBODY CAN PAY SOMEBODY TO WORK  (fe_03_07756-B-0063)
UM  (fe_03_07756-B-0066)
WALMART FOR EXAMPLE PAYS UH IT STARTS OUT AT FIVE FIFTY A LOT OF BUSINESSES DO THAT BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES BELIEVE IT'S TOO LOW  (fe_03_07756-B-0068)
SO IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT THEY THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PAY ABOVE IT  (fe_03_07756-B-0069)
BUT THAT'S USUALLY A MAJOR CORPORATION AND NOT ANY [MN] PRIVATE COMPANY  (fe_03_07756-B-0070)
NO  (fe_03_07756-B-0071)
NOT THAT I NOT THAT I HAVE HEARD  (fe_03_07756-B-0072)

I'M A SINGLE PARENT MYSELF AND AND UM  (fe_03_07756-B-0080)
THE THE COST OF PAYING A BABYSITTER AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF MONEY COMPARED TO WHAT I MAKE IS JUST IT'S IT'S NOT  (fe_03_07756-B-0081)
IT'S NOT FEASIBLE I MEAN I COULDN'T  (fe_03_07756-B-0082)
PAY A SITTER MORE THAN PROBABLY FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR IT WOULD ALWAYS BE UNDER MINIMUM WAGE  (fe_03_07756-B-0083)
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T MAKE THAT MUCH ABOVE IT AND YOU KNOW THERE'S  (fe_03_07756-B-0084)
THERE'S OTHER KIDS TO FEED SO  (fe_03_07756-B-0085)
[NOISE]  (fe_03_07756-B-0086)

YEAH COMPARED TO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE CAR YOU HAVE THE GAS YOU HAVE THE HOUSE PAYMENT UTILITIES AND THEN YOU HAVE FOOD AND  (fe_03_07756-B-0088)
YOU HAVE DAYCARE UNFORTUNATELY IS IS A LOW PRIORITY  (fe_03_07756-B-0089)
AS FAR AS AN EXPENSE COMPARED TO WHAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS  (fe_03_07756-B-0090)
'CAUSE I THINK LIKE A A DAYCARE CENTER ITSELF WOULD CHARGE I KNOW AROUND THE AREA I LIVE IN WEST VIRGINIA IT'S SIXTY DOLLARS A WEEK  (fe_03_07756-B-0091)
SO UM  (fe_03_07756-B-0092)
REALLY THEY DON'T CHARGE TOO MUCH THEY DON'T EVEN CHARGE MINIMUM WAGE PER HOUR FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES  (fe_03_07756-B-0093)
UM IN TH- IN THIS AREA LIKE I SAID IT'S A VERY RURAL AREA SO A LOT OF PEOPLE DEPEND ON THAT ONE DAYCARE  (fe_03_07756-B-0094)
[NOISE] RIGHT RIGHT  (fe_03_07756-B-0096)
BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT OPTION PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CITY PROBABLY PAY WAY WAY [LAUGHTER] WAY MORE THAN WHAT I WOULD THINK WOULD BE REASONABLE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_07756-B-0097)
YEAH I THINK IT JUST IT'S IT DEPENDS A LOT ON ON THE AREA YOU LIVE IN AND AND WHAT YOU'RE USED TO TO PAYING  (fe_03_07756-B-0098)
[NOISE] YES WE'RE PROBABLY WORTH ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS THERE IN BOSTON ITSELF [MN]  (fe_03_07756-B-0100)
YEAH THE COST OF LIVING IS IS REALLY AWFUL LOW IN SOME PLACES [NOISE]  (fe_03_07756-B-0101)
SO DO YOU WORK WHILE YOU GO TO SCHOOL  (fe_03_07756-B-0102)
