L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  [several inaudible words] Hello.
R:  Hello.  Who's this?
L:  Ah, my name's Steve.
R:  Steve, hi.  My name's Angie.
L:  How's it going?
R:  All right.  How are you?
L:  I'm doing good.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Ah, I'm right outside of Boston right now.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, you guys getting any rain or is it sunny?
L:  Ah, it's nice and sunny now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It was raining yesterday.
R:  Same here.  Getting a lot --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- better now.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what's your opinion on this Iraq?
L:  Um, I think that it's a pretty good idea to disarm Iraq but you can't, like, get all the weapons out of Iraq, like.  They need some sort of self defense from all the looters.
R:  But [MN] --
L:  But they've kind of got the situation under control, I guess.
R:  But the thing is, though, they haven't found any weapons though.  I mean, I -- I don't disagree with the war but I'm just like, well, I mean, there -- ah, where are the weapons?  You know, was that the selling point for the war or was it because of the terrorism?
L:  Yeah.  I think it might have been because of the terrorism.  I was reading on line today they found -- they, like, people were turning in their weapons.  They got, like, anti tank grenades, anti aircraft guns, like --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- but was only like a fraction of what they should have been getting.
R:  But they're still finding stuff?
L:  Yeah, people are, like, turning in weapons but just, like, a real small percentage of them.
R:  Not mass- -- yeah, no- nothing really big that would be of threat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  O- on a mass scale I guess.  Huh.
L:  Yeah, it's not like chemical weapons being turned in or anything.
R:  Yeah, I had heard about them talking about these, [MN] ah, mobile, kind of, ah, chemical weapon stations, I guess, and they're just driving them around and, but nothing on that -- in that respect either, so, just like, well, it's good to hear that the Iraqi people feel free but every day we're getting someone killed, you know, we're trying to establish peace there post war and, ah, I'm -- [MN] h- honestly I'm kind of fed up with it.  I'd -- I'd rather they all come back and have total anarchy over there.  That's just -- that's just my opinion, I guess.  What are your thoughts?  [PAUSE] Hello. [PAUSE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Oh, sorry, my service is going out on my cell phone.
R:  Oh, I wasn't sure.  I was, like, is this thing over? [MN]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Like, oh, for how long do I have to talk about [MN] this, ah, the war?
L:  Um, I think they said, like, eight minutes.
R:  Eight minutes.
L:  And then you can leave comments after for two minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.  And how did you hear about the study?
L:  Um, I was actually looking at a classifieds thing.  It's like a little local Boston thing on line --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and then there was a little ad on there.
R:  Huh.
L:  It's kind of interesting.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I think it's a good i- -- especially for speech recognition.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think that's what the study was for and for the computers to be able to understand what's going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know IBM was doing that for a while.  So, where do you think they're going next for war?  Do you think they're going to I- Iran?  Pulling out?  What are --
L:  Um --
R:  -- your thoughts on that?
L:  Well, I guess there's, like, uprisings in Iran now from the, ah, students and, ah, I guess it's been pretty violent, like the, ah, pro-clergy[?] forces, ah, trying to keep 'em down, [inaudible] lots of violence.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, they're trying to get more reform, like, they -- the, ah, anniversary of -- there was an uprising, like, ninety nine.  I think the anniversary is coming up in like a week or so and I think that's why all these, like, protests are going on over there, 'cause they're trying to get reform in the government.
R:  But that's -- is that unrelated to what's going on in Iraq?  Is that just them with their own government?
L:  I think that's them with their own government but, um, I -- I think America has something to do with it.  Like, they're just trying to chase away, like, all the people that were in Iraq like Saddam.  Like, that's where they think that he is actually.  In Iran.
R:  In Iran?
L:  Yes.  Like, even though, like, they're, um, like, they've been enemies since, like, biblical times but lately they've been, like, cooperating.  They think that they have weapons of mass destruction too.  I just see another war coming against Iran.
R:  I know.  Do you think it --
L:  I think it's --
R:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
L:  Oh, no, I think it's completely, like, unnecessary to, like, go chasing people around, like, nothing has concretely happened after nine eleven that would show --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that there's, like, countries against us.  Like, there's individuals but I don't think there's any countries that would be, like, sending chemical weapons over.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  And I don't know if our economy can support it at this point.  You know, there's just so much unemployment here and people are just kind of, y- you know, builders -- they're slacking off and people are just getting fed up with, you know, fed up with the war and they're just trying to look at how to make ends meet.  You know, just, it seems like unemployment is just so high and the amount of money that they're spending in Iraq and people always hate us anyways, you know, after a war, you know, we -- we free the French, we -- we free the f- -- Germans in Berlin and we're always freeing everyone and everyone hates us more so it's like, come on, unless -- unless there's real evidence of -- of weapons of mass destruction and there's a direct correlation I -- I think we should just get out and let them kind of all destroy themselves but, um, li- -- just -- it -- it sounds outrageous [MN] what they're doing and, I don't know.  Now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- do you think that the, ah, this whole plague thing that's coming in -- what is it, monkey pox -- is -- is anything outside, any kind of conspiracy at all or ...?
L:  Um, I don't know.  There's been a lot of, like, outbreaks of, like, diseases lately.
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't know if it would be related to, like, chemical weapons but --
R:  Yeah, I really wonder.
L:  -- it just seems kind a weird that there's all these diseases coming up now.
R:  I know.  Are they coming into the US and, well, far as, I mean, that's something else and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's crazy and I know -- I mean, I -- I lived out west and I remember that they had, that they were doing studies with the bubonic plaque on the, ah, prairie dogs so it seems to be pretty -- pretty good carriers for huge diseases.  So, I'm kinda surprised -- I didn't even know people had 'em as pets, but, um, coming in from Africa and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially Africa where they got the, what was it, the chimpanzees brought AIDS and it was just like, "Oh, my gosh". [MN] Just probably all the crap coming in here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, have you lived in Boston all your life or what's going on?
L:  Yeah, I've lived here for nineteen years.
R:  Wow.  And --
L:  It's a nice place.
R:  Yeah, Boston seems like --
L:  Couldn't imagine living anywhere else.  Just --
R:  Really.
L:  -- weird mother.  [LAUGH]
R:  The wh- -- the -- the only thing is in the winter though.  It'd be freezing.
L:  Oh, yeah.  My friend was up at, ah, the University of Vermont and it got to negative twenty eight without the wind chill. 
R:  Oh!
L:  [MN] He said you could dr- -- like pour a glass of water on the ground and it would freeze up, like, almost instantly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Freezing.  Oh, my gosh.  That's cold.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Unbelievable. [MN]
L:  They had to walk to class in it.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Ride a bike to class.  [MN] That stinks.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, ah, Vermont seems to be pretty liberal when it came to the whole war situation.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What was that?  Did any of your relatives who -- or friends who were out there, were there any -- any of 'em against the war?
L:  Um, not my friends that went to the school.  I had a couple of friends who were up there but there were, like, a lot of, like, protests going on and stuff like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you could see where both sides of the -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- problem would be coming from. [MN]
R:  I know.  That's the tough thing.  [MN] The -- a- and I went to South America 'cause I got a lot of family down there and they were all, I mean, they hate the US, so anything the US is -- especially the -- and the British too, because of the Falkland war, but anything that they're involved in, they were just against it.  And they were trying to understand, well, why are you again- -- you know, all the -- the arguments that we're used to hearing and, [MN] you know, that we're making and all that and they were --they're just like, you know, I think it comes down to just jealousy.  You know, people are jealous of, ah, of the US because they're so successful and so anything that you guys are -- are involved in, we just -- we can't stand.  [MN]  We're -- we're against it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's like, oh, well, that's -- I mean, [MN] that's, I mean, I -- I think that that -- that's why a lot of countries hate the US and we're always trying to do good and [MN], you know, unfortunately no one's -- no one's too thankful for it. [MN] But ...
L:  Yeah, 'cause they see it as, ah, sticking our nose in someone else's business.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we see it as trying to big brother the planet.
R:  I know.  That- that's exactly it.  They see us being butting in and -- and we see it as being very helpful.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like the mother in laws, like, trying to help everyone.  Like, oh, let 'em all kill each other.  We don't care, you know, it's, ah, it's just, it's crazy.  I don't know.  Have you ever been to Iraq?
L:  Oh, no.  I -- I haven't travelled out of the country except to Canada.  I went to Montreal --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- this past year.
R:  It's real nice.
L:  Beautiful city.
R:  Yeah.  It is really nice, actually.  Wow.  Yeah, I haven't been to Ira- -- I had a friend who went to Iraq but, ah, for women unless you're really dressed in the traditional garb, it's not a good thing.  They kind of all pinch you and [MN] they think you're -- they think you're all prostitutes, you know, walking around. [MN] So ...
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH].
R:  It's kind of, like, "Oh, man, what a crappy country for -- for women to -- to live".  And what --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- did -- did you hear anything about that one lady in Florida who's, like, all covered up to her eyes and she wants to be able to get her licence taken that way?
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] completely ridiculous. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  You know that's how you'd recognize her in public, like, you need to have, like, an actual identification, like, in case --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- something happened to you.
R:  And -- and the whole violation of her rights.  I'm like, "Man, if you were in Middle East you wouldn't -- you would have to sit in the back seat of the car.  You wouldn't be allowed to drive your own car".  I mean, women can't go out by themselves.  They have to be accompanied by -- I mean, come on.  So, how can it be a violation of your rights?  Just, God.  Do you know what happened?  Is the case still going on or ...?
