R:  Michelle.
L:  Hello, my name is Muzar[?].  I'm calling from Seattle, Washington.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, this is the second time I'm calling.
R:  Yeah, this is my second time as well.
L:  Yeah, could -- and, um, the topic is holidays, I think so --
R:  Yes, it was.
L:  -- um, which one's your favorite holiday in the past?
R:  Um, well basically the only holiday I celebrate is Jesus Christ's memorial --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it has to do with the Bible and, uh, the fact that Jesus told us to, um, celebrate his death --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, uh, that's the holiday that I celebrate usually, on Nisan fourteen, um, every year.
L:  I see, and, um -- uh, I actually, um, uh, don't celebrate that either, uh, that, uh -- I -- I'm sorry for -- because of my bad English, I am, um, from Turkey and, uh --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so it is actually not in my tradition to, uh, celebrate that holiday but, uh, since I live in the United States --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it is a, uh, nice time, uh, that we share with all people who celebrates the holiday and --
R:  Right.
L:  And, uh, it's, uh -- everybody participates in the, uh, holiday thing and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, people have a lot of fun, they enjoy it.  Um, back in Turkey we have different holidays and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they celebrate it, too, but, um, I don't participate in that a lot too because, um, it is -- you know, it's -- it's not very good if it's a must and --
R:  Uh --
L:  -- it's like ritual more than real.
R:  Right.
L:  So, um, yeah, it -- they are still good days because, uh, all the peoples have the same feelings, they share it and, uh, uh, the only thing that I don't like about it to, um, um -- to -- to -- to be obligated to participate in it.
R:  Right.
L:  Uh, otherwise it's nice and, um -- and what do you do by celebrating that holiday time?
R:  Um, well Jesus Christ told us in the Bible to, um -- well, basically it was like the last -- the Lord evening meal and, um, he drunk wine and, um, ate bread, uh, with his disciples.  So basically we just, um, pass it on to, uh, one another.  We don't --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, drink it or eat it but we just pass it around.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, just a memorial to Jesus Christ that he had died for mankind and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and it was just a special day, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So that's what, uh, the holiday's about and, uh, it's based on the Bible 'cause most of the other holidays in the, um -- that the -- actually in -- in United States they celebrate it.  It's not Bible based, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They just made it up or it's a pagan origin --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- doesn't have anything to do with the Bible, specially like Christmas, it has nothing to do with the Bible at all.
L:  [NOISE] Has not?
R:  No, it doesn't -- has nothing to do --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with the Bible [LAUGH].
L:  I didn't know that. [LAUGH]
R:  Be -- because, um -- well, according to the world they celebrate Jesus, um, birthday on the twenty fifth --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and nobody knows when his birthday is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause it's not stated in the Bible.
L:  I see.
R:  Um, nor was he a little boy -- uh, a little baby --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- at that time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, when they -- they talking about celebrating it, he was a young child.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  And, um, the three Magi were actually astrologers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, they kinda glorify that but the Bible against -- against astrologers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and the reason why the three astrologers are supposed to be going out to seek Jesus was to really kill him.
L:  I see.
R:  Um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so that was really their purpose and yet, you know --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- the people, like, glorifying the three, uh, Magi.
L:  Uh-huh, um --
R:  So, um, it -- it has -- all of that stuff has nothing to do with [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  With the Bible.
L:  I didn't know that.  You know a lot about, uh, uh, historical religion and --
R:  Yeah, yeah, I do.
L:  -- the religion itself, yeah.
R:  Pretty much.
L:  You are very well informed and, uh, is Easter not a bab- -- +Bible -- Bible based holiday, too?
R:  [MN] That's right 'cause Easter has to do with the, um -- the -- the -- the sex organs, the -- the worship of [MN] having sex, actually.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The goddess Isis --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, 'cause she likes to have sex with any and every thing, um, and that's where the rabbit comes in 'cause the -- the rabbit has a lot of babies and can multiply.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It has nothing to do with Jesus, 'cause Jesus -- it has nothing to do with him at all.
L:  Um, who -- who, uh -- who -- who is the rabbit, you say?
R:  You know the rabbits that they celebrate with Easter?  The rabbits and the eggs?
L:  Yes, yes, yes.
R:  The -- the rabbit represents fertility.
L:  Oh, fertility, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Right, right and, you know, the rabbit multiplies and has a lot of babies, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, Isis, the goddess, uh, she --
L:  Isis is then, um -- but is Isis from the Bible, too?
R:  No, no, no.
L:  No, it's not?
R:  This is a pagan god.
L:  I see, yeah.
R:  They --
L:  That -- that's what I --  
R:  They just heard the name around and call it Easter --
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  And so you -- you say it is -- so it's not Christian?
R:  No, it's not Christian at all.
L:  Oh, it's pagan, yeah, I see.
R:  Not Christian. [LAUGH]
L:  I see. [LAUGH]
R:  She was a sex goddess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It has nothing to do with the Bible whatsoever --
L:  [NOISE] I see, I see.
R:  -- you know, so ...
L:  But, um, as far as I experience here or, uh, in Europe, um, uh, people don't have sex at Easter but they buy their children the rabbits and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the eggs --
R:  And --
L:  -- and, um --
R:  And don't even understand exactly what it -- what it means, you know.
L:  I see.  Uh-huh.
R:  It does have some symbolics, you know.
L:  I see.  So -- so -- so you know this root, uh, actual information so, uh, a lot of people do not know it I think.  I -- I -- it --
R:  Mm, just want to go to the library --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and sometimes it's in the encyclopedia itself.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You look up in a dictionary --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you look under Easter, it would give you some background --
L:  Yeah, I, mm --
R:  -- under that, you know.
L:  So since I am not from this culture so I'm -- I don't know a lot about it but, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I -- I think I would know more if I lived here for all my life but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm -- I'm learning, that's a good, uh, part of the study, isn't it?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, or you just have to read the Bible and just compare to what other people are doing and see --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, is it legit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, just a matter of comparing.
L:  That -- that --
R:  If it's not in there, then, you know, why do it?
L:  Yeah, my -- my -- um, my information is, um, maybe as much as a -- a six year old child because [LAUGH] I'm here for a [LAUGH] couple of years and, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- for sure I know more about the, um, Eastern traditions and, uh, um, most of I know about the Western tradition is that, uh, what I read or heard on TV --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at that time, yeah, yeah.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And what is good, um -- so is the topic only the, um --
R:  Yeah, just that.
L:  -- holidays.
R:  The holidays --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and what holiday you would like to make up if there was such a holiday and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh --
L:  So -- so this is -- this is not about the vacations that you take in summer or something like that?
R:  Um, no.
L:  No, uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  Just -- just the holidays.
L:  I see.
R:  Um, if there was such a holiday to make up, I really say it -- the holiday that, you know, the whole world is at peace, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's one big celebration. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's right and --
R:  You know.
L:  And what's your occupation?  Are you a teacher or something, like --
R:  Am I a teacher?  No, I'm into the Bible, I'm into the Bible --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so I really, you know, enjoy it, um --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- it's real --
L:  It's good to know so much about the, uh, Bible and, uh, religion.
R:  Right, and especially the different religions and, you know, how they started and --
L:  It -- it gives peace doesn't it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, if you have more information about it and you know what to, uh, celebrate, what not to celebrate --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and how to celebrate.
R:  Uh, that's right, that's right.
L:  Yeah, and you can teach your, uh, children and --
R:  Yeah, I talk to people all the time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- basically, uh, you know, just got to be careful if something is manmade and it's not in the Bible, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- not to follow what everybody else is doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so, um, pretty much that's the only holiday I celebrate. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I might celebrate some anniversaries here and then and -- and that's something fun to do, you know, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- whether it's a graduation or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, somebody's wedding an -- fiftieth anniversary [LAUGH] wedding --
L:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
R:  -- or, you know, things like that I'll celebrate.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, but to me Mothers' Day is every day, Fathers' Day is every day --
L:  Every day, uh-huh.
R:  -- um [MN] --
L:  Like today is Fathers' Day.
R:  [inaudible] day should be every day, I mean, shouldn't be a +specific, you know, day --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- to show somebody that you love them.
L:  Uh, and do you mean birthday?
R:  Yeah, well, birthday that -- it's -- I -- I -- I'll acknowledge my birthday and acknowledge other people's birthday but I don't make a big thing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- out of it because when you born --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you didn't do nothing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you didn't accomplish anything yet.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.
R:  It's when you die --
L:  It's not a sex test, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- is -- is when you accomplish everything, everybody knows what you did in life, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, um --
L:  That's much later, so ... mhm.
R:  Yeah, so that's when Jesus was born he didn't make no big thing out of his, uh -- his birth --
L:  Birth, uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, he made a big thing out of his death --
L:  That's right.
R: -- when he -- he knew he was going to die.
L:  Sure. [NOISE]
R:  So, um [LIPSMACK] --
L:  And --
R:  And, um, so that's what basically it is.  You know you should, like, get to the Bible more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.
L:  Um --
