R:  Hi.  I'm Nancy.
L:  Ah, hi.  I'm, ah, Christopher.
R:  Hi, Christopher.  How are ya?
L:  Oh, just fine and yourself?
R:  Doing fine, thanks.
L:  Ah, nice to meet you.
R:  You too.  So, I guess the topic is the Iraqi war that's here and gone already, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Apparently so. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, well, [LAUGH] my viewpoint is that I was totally against it.
L:  Well, I gotta agree with you there.
R:  I was a -- I was a protester. [LAUGH]
L:  As was I.
R:  Oh, now, see, that -- what's the chances of that happening?  [LAUGH] I thought I was gonna get someone who was all gung ho for it.  Um --
L:  Well, I can pretend if that would help. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I don't think so. 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's a good thing.  I'm glad that we don't have, [MN] you know, different views [inaudible].  Um, [MN] yeah, I mean, what was your opinion about it?
L:  Well, I didn't really think there were any weapons there and there aren't and now I think they probably should get spanked for, ah, saying, "Oh, there's weapons and everything" and now they're, like, " [MN] Never mind", and nobody's calling on them.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And that's, well, irritating, really.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, because, you know, we all knew, but ...
R:  Exactly, and it's -- it put so many lives at risk and -- a- and just the -- the people that were -- that were killed for absolutely nothing over there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Y- you know and, um, yeah, and I -- I believe if it was a -- a Democrat in all this and they pulled that I believe he would be hanging by his toes right about now.
L:  [LAUGH] To be honest, if it had been a Democrat in office he probably wouldn't have survived.
R:  We wouldn't have gone.  [LAUGH] We probably wouldn't even have gone.
L:  [MN] He wouldn't have survived being in office through the end of two -- the year two thousand.
R:  I- it's true.  It was -- it was just such a -- a waste of money, time, people's lives, I mean [MN], and to think that it's, like, to- -- what was it, just today they had more people killed over there?
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have no business there.  None at all.  You know, um, I just feel like that whole Middle East thing is something we should stay out of.
L:  Yeah, I have no idea what we can do.  You know, obviously, you know, there's conflicts over there and I don't want to poke in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I think as people we gotta work towards peace in the region in some way.
R:  Right.  For the children.
L:  [MN] Can we oppose peace?  No.
R:  Well, for the children too, you know.  I mean, ah, my kids, um, you know, my -- I have young kids, um, nine and ten, and, um, they were quite well informed about the war.  I mean, I made no, you know, excuses for it [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, good.
R:  -- and, um, I even, you know, I was amazed with the school systems, how the school systems handled this war and how, what they were teaching these children, that war is okay and, you know, they didn't even teach the other side of it which was --
L:  Oh, they never do.
R:  -- quite upsetting to me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, I g- -- I was shocked.  I -- I, you know, I kept telling my kids you gotta go in and ask your teachers, you know, maybe they should be teaching you about peace instead of writing to the soldiers and -- and supporting that whole realm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, of course, they don't wanna hear that and, um, so yeah, I just felt like it was a -- it was just a total m- -- just a mess and uncalled for, and now it's gonna be interesting to see if he goes unpunished for what he did.
L:  [MN] Well, he'll definitely get away with it but that's only because I'm a cynic. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You know, I -- I don't feel that way because I will be out there. [MN] I know he's coming up to Newark on Monday.  I'm from Jersey.
L:  Ah.
R:  And I believe he's going to be in Newark on Monday and I know there's g- -- a few -- quite a few people going down there Monday --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to confront him a little bit --
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  -- and ask him where the weapons are.  Make -- make good on them, you know, you were so sure that [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Saddam had 'em.  But, you know, what?  He -- he had nothing.
L:  Yeah.  I think, ah, the rallying cry should be, "Where were the weapons, George?"
R:  Yes, it should be and, you know -- and, I ca- -- even too I wa- -- I watched today the news.  I was watching the whole thing about, like, the Palestinian state in Israel now and that's gonna be next, you know, it's just gonna be one more big blunder and, oh, the whole -- the whole region over there is messed up and we shouldn't even be involved.  God will deal with it all.  [LAUGH] That's the way I look at it.
L:  Well, hopefully.  Well, hopefully.
R:  Yeah, hopefully he will, you know.  Ah, hold on 'cause I'm gonna lose you, I think.  My battery's dying on my phone.  Hang on a second.  Can you pick up that phone, hon?  [NOISE] Oh, hold on.  I'm sorry about that.  There we go.  Okay, I made it.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] So, anyway.
L:  Don't worry about it.
R:  So, yes, so I just, um, I don't know, I was against it and I -- I really don't have much more to say about it except I think it was a disgrace for this country to do what they did.  
L:  [MN] Yeah, I gotta agree with you there and [MN] the thing I'm worried about is, ah, how they've managed to keep the terror going at -- at home for all these months now.  I'm a librarian and we're really taking it on the chin as far as the Patriot Act.
R:  [MN] Right.  Right.  Well, that's the other thing too.  I mean, like the way they're, um, [MN] I just think the whole thing is so, like, out of control and how they're using that to really control this country.  You know the Patriot Act is the thing that, like, it's -- it's -- it's -- do you know anything about that?  Like, explain it to me a little bit more.
L:  What, the Patriot Act?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, ah, some interest- --
R:  That's almost taking away our rights, isn't it?
L:  Well, ah, I'm specifically interested in library aspects of it but, ah, one thing is if the Feds come and ask for your record, um, we have to give it to them.  We can't mention to anyone, even our, ah, counsel --
R:  [NOISE] Mhm.
L:  -- legal counsel, that they've been there.  Um, we have essentially no right of appeal for that and if we even say anything we can
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get busted too.
R:  [NOISE] [MN] Right, well, that's like with the schools too, right?  All the kids that -- that's somehow tied into the school system too, isn't it?  For the children I think they were saying?  For, like, the drafts?
L:  I hadn't heard about that.
R:  [NOISE] No, I had heard something like that too, that if -- with that new thing, no child left behind.  It was somehow tied into that Patriot Act in that [MN] it will be able to track these children so when it comes time, like, you know, for the Armed Forces, they -- somehow that's tied into that.  I remember reading something about that about a month and a half ago --
L:  Mm.
R:  --S and I was quite offended by that too because my kids would never be allowed to serve unless, of course, they turn eighteen and leave my side.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, but the -- it's -- it was somehow tied into that Patriot Act, so it is an infringement of rights.
L:  Yep.
R:  Well, that's the way the country is going and everybody's thinking everything is hunky dory because of all the terrorists you know, all that stuff that they keep saying's gonna happen, gonna happen but I just think that's making everybody [MN] more apt to fall into a, um, [MN] Bush regime, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, precisely.
R:  Yeah, it's getting -- it's getting crazy.  It's not what it used to be.
L:  And Halliburton made how much on the war? [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  For that no bid contract.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's pathetic, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It' -- it's just all about money and power and [MN] it's like a chess game --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we're all the pawns just waiting to see what the end is, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But in the end it will all [LAUGH] -- in the end they'll all have to answer for it, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All the killing.  You know, they all have blood on their hands.  All of 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, the -- I mean, as far as the Iraq war too, [MN] they c- -- they called the terrorist on nine one one terrorist, you know, what were we when we went over there and did what we did?
L:  [MN] Yeah, it's really not a good idea to respond to someone destroying your homeland by going over to their homeland and then bombing the crap out of it. [MN]
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know about you but I'm pretty religious and you know what?  Y- you don't, you know, God says you don't -- you know, you turn your other cheek and love your enemies, no matter what.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, if everybody took a stand in- instead of, you know, killing, [MN] turning around and killing as revenge, you know, maybe -- maybe there would be some divine intervention, you know what I mean?
L:  It might happen.
R:  You know, I mean, nobody ever gives him a chance and everybody's so quick to take revenge into their own hands and -- and that's, you know, that's why I'm so against the war because I just, um, you know, my beliefs are as strong about, you know, turning the other cheek and -- and love your enemy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, and, um, that's what I try to teach my kids and it's so hard in a country where revenge is the, you know, [MN] it's the first thing they do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  With everybody, you know, and yeah, you're right, [MN] you know, evil begets evil and violence begets violence.
L:  Yep.
R:  And they teach that to the kids in school that, you know, you've gotta, you know, not -- not, you know, do those kind of things and then they turn around and [MN] say it's okay to go ahead and do that, you know, go over there and -- and bomb them because they bombed us there or, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he's got these things, th- these weapons of mass destruction so let's -- let's just go over there and bomb them and kill their people.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  And that's what they're teaching these children.
L:  [MN] Then, ah, it's, um, [several inaudible words] we -- I don't know [inaudible].
R:  Mhm.  Are you from this --
L:  And we give --
R:  -- where are you from?
L:  Ah, I'm from, ah, Chicago.
R:  You're out in Chicago?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, did you guys have a lot of peace protests out there?
L:  Oh, a pretty fair amount.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, one downside with, ah, my line of work is I really couldn't wear the buttons or the shirts at work.
R:  They real -- really?
L:  Well, ah, legally, ah, anyone who works in a library is not allowed to have any kind of political statement --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on themselves, including bumper stickers.
R:  You're kidding me!
L:  Well, since people rely us as, ah, information professionals and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- sources of news, um, we have to be as un, quote unquote, biased as possible.
R:  Right.
L:  Which, of course, I think's kind of a load of --
R:  Yeah, it is baloney.
L:  Well, you know, because by remaining silent when there's basic inequalities already out there --
