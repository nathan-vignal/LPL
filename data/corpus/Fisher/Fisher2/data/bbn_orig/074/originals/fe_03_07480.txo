R:  Hello?
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, this is Christie.
R:  Hi, I -- I'm Elizabeth.
L:  Hi, Elizabeth.  Where are you calling from?  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  Um, New Hampshire in Durham.  How about you?
L:  Ah, Indianapolis, Indiana.  [SIGH]
R:  Wow!
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  It's just --
R:  Nice to talk to you.
L:  Yeah, you too.  [SIGH]  Holidays?
R:  Do you have a favorite holiday?
L:  Oh, gosh, yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I do.  It -- it's Easter.
R:  [SIGH]  O- oh, tell me about it?
L:  Um, I just love springtime.  I like what Easter stands for.  [SIGH]  Ever since I was little and, of course, I l- like the Easter baskets and the bunnies --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and ... it's just [SIGH] everything's waking up again, you know.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  And I like what Easter stands for.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, that's my holiday.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  What is yours?
R:  My favorite -- I think my favorite is Christmas.
L:  Ah -- well, without a doubt!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That comes a close second for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, tell me [SIGH] what you love about it?
R:  [SIGH]  I love, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I love the, um, -- t- the --you know, t- the -- c- celebration of, [LIPSMACK] um, the birthday of -- [SIGH] of Jesus.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I also love, you know, just the spirit of giving.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, and I love how in the mi- -- you know, sort of in the [SIGH] -- in the middle of winter which we -- [SIGH] you know, up here in the New Hampshire it's usually s- snowing and grey and cold and --
L:  O- o- oh, gosh we had a -- a winter like that.  I know what you're saying.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I love there -- just, you know, everybody puts out all these li- -- beautiful lights.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  And, [SIGH] um, --
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]
R:  -- I just, you know, I love all the decorations.  I love everything.
L:  Well, you know --
R:  I love the --
L:  -- you- -- you're on to something --
R:  -- Christmas carols.
L:  -- here.
R:  Mm?
L:  I think you're on to something here 'cause Easter's too short.  It's just a day.  [SIGH]  And it doesn't include [SIGH] m- many people as Christmas does.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  So, ... hm, ... you gave me a thought.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, how long -- um, you know, I was just -- I'm just curious since you're in New Hampshire and we're here in Indiana [SIGH] -- how -- when do you think ... t- the official Christmas season starts and when do you think it ends?  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  That's a good question.  Um, [SIGH] let's see?  [SIGH]
L:  'Cause I just wonder if it's different in other parts of the country?
R:  [SIGH]  Well, here it's -- um, [SIGH] you know, I think that like people -- people round here think it starts [SIGH] the day after Thanksgiving.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  But lately the past couple of years in the stores around here you start seeing Christmas stuff, believe it or not, in September.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Which is a shock!
L:  That sounds right.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Un- unfortunately, that's the same thing here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I mean --
R:  I mean it's a shock when you're like, you know, [SIGH] you're still wearing short sleeves in September and you're like [SIGH] --
L:  Isn't it weird.
R:  -- "Oh, my God!"  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I will never forget when I -- I first realized that was happening too.  [SIGH]  And we don't go to the mall too often my -- my young sons and I but [SIGH] -- but we ha- -- we're coming up the escalator and you should've seen his eyes.  He goes, "Mom, [SIGH] it's Christmas time!" and it was like the end of September --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I s- said, "N- no, but there were ... Christmas trees as far as you could see --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with all the dec- decorations on.  [SIGH]  And it was really cruel to him 'cause he was ... kind of small --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- to have to wait three more months.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  And I mean, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a week is too long for a --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- little kid to wait for Christmas.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, I know.  And, of course, you know, all the stuff is right next to the Halloween stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just bizarre.
R:  [SIGH]  Isn't that s- strange?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's just r- really weird.  Really --
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  -- weird.  Well how -- how long, um, d- do you think Christmas goes around your place?  [SIGH]
R:  Well, let's [NOISE] see?  [SIGH]  It -- I mean people seem to, like, leave their lights on and everything t- through, [SIGH] u- um, [LIPSMACK] -- through De- -- through New Years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right around there.
L:  Well, there would be my new law, my new holiday.  [LIPSMACK]  Because, what you said about it being grey; [SIGH] it being wintertime.  [SIGH]  One of the hardest months for me to get through is January.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, me too!
L:  There's nothing in it, is there?
R:  Oh, there's nothing.
L:  [LAUGH]  There's nothing!  [LAUGH]
R:  And you've got the, sort of, the post Christmas New Years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- let down.
L:  It really is.
R:  And really nothing ... that close to look forward to.
L:  Nah, not at all.  Not at all.  [SIGH]  So, my plan -- and I don't think this is, like, a holiday or anything [SIGH] but if I was the mayor or governor [SIGH] the l- lights -- the Christmas lights would have to stay on all through the end of January.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  'Cause you know it -- they just go out don't they and it's just -- there's nothing!  [LAUGH]
R:  They -- I -- I love your --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- idea.  I would vote for you.
L:  Oh, thank you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Oh, my -- my poor sons have heard this idea s- so many times --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because, [SIGH] you know, we -- we always cheer the -- the people that a- are too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- lazy or can't get their lights down if -- if they go on through, like, the second week of January.  "Oh, right!  Their lights are still [LAUGH] o- on".  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Me t- t- too!
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They're few and far between unfortunately.
L:  They really are.  They are and we just -- y- you know, you just see them blink off and [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- one house after another and then it's just that long thirty days.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Thirty one days.  Thirty one days.
R:  There's one house here, um, in Durham --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] and they leave the lights up, you know, even those little, like, candle lights in the windows --
L:  Oh, neat!
R:  -- all year round.
L:  Well, you know, that would be a start.
R:  I've been thinking about like, [SIGH] you know, I don't know them but they -- you know, they're near me and I've been thinking about leaving a little card in their mailbox saying, "Thank you, everytime I drive by it cheers me up".
L:  Oh, that's a good idea.
R:  'Cause I love it and it -- it's so pretty [SIGH] all -- I mean a summer night you're driving by it's just beautiful.
L:  Well, you know, sometimes -- I don't know [SIGH] how big ... D- Durham is [SIGH] but I know downtown Indianapolis -- I live about, ah, twenty five minutes [SIGH] they -- they sometimes will leave, ah, clear colored lights in the trees --
R:  O- oh, right.
L:  -- you know, like all year.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, like, in hotel lobbies or outside and -- and I'm like, "Well, why not?"
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But I'll tell you an idea that I've done, Elizabeth, and [SIGH] my boys t- thought [LAUGH] I was crazy.  [SIGH]  But ... I had one single strand of ... clear, you know, ... l- lights --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and, um, I'm like, "Okay, where am I going to put this?  The trees loaded and [SIGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, so I went upstairs [SIGH] and I just d- draped them -- [SIGH] kind of weirdly o- on my lace curtains.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!
L:  And, you know, I've left those up for two y- years.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I bet they look g- great!
L:  They really do look good.  So, there's a hint for you, a little idea.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  And actually when I -- I just -- those are the only ones I turn on and it illuminates the room just enough.  It's just a cozy feeling.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  It really is nice.
R:  Oh, it sounds kind of nice and romantic too.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it is and -- and my s- -- that's another thing when [LAUGH] [SIGH] when my parents came to visit, they've moved to Arizona, they were like, "Okay, what's with the lights?" because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] and I -- I've been unfortunately single for almost ... eight years and [LAUGH] --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well it's for me, you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  I can relate.  I'm single too.  [LAUGH]
L:  You a- are!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my gosh!  Have you ever been married?
R:  [SIGH]  No.
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  So,, it's been a really long time for me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I -- I -- you know, from the sound of your voice I can't tell how old you are.  So, ...
R:  O- o- oh, you're sweet.
L:  No, I'm --
R:  I'm thirty six.
L:  Oh -- well, I'm o- older than you.  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't sound it.
L:  Well, I'm forty three and a h- half.
R:  Oh, well I can't tell from your voice either.  You sound very young and chipper.
L:  Oh, thank you.  Well -- I tell you what -- kids, especially boys make you ... stay young.  They insist on it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, what -- what's the summer like for you when you're single?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  It's -- it's p- pretty quiet.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it -- it's very quiet here right now.  In fact, um, w- we're actually talking on a holiday aren't we?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  A- and --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I know.  I realized when I called in, "I may be waiting a long time for [LAUGH] somebody".  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I know it -- it's Fathers' Day and, is your father still alive?
R:  [SIGH]  No, mine passed away about five years ago.
L:  Oh, I'm so sorry.  This c- cannot be an easy holiday then?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, I've been thinking about him quite a bit but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I feel like [SIGH] really at pe- -- I feel [SIGH] really at peace with him.  I feel him quite often.
L:  Oh, that's neat.  That's good.
R:  And so I -- I really -- it -- it feels like he's with me.
L:  [SIGH]  My best friend h- has the same feeling.  Her dad, I think, died s- seven years ago and she just [SIGH] had her first child.  And --
R:  [LIPSMACK]  O- oh!
L:  -- [SIGH] s- she -- she actually put her dad's ... teddy bear --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- in -- in the little bassinet, --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- at the hospital with her.  She just feels him too all the time.  And [SIGH] I try not to say anything because I -- I kind of grumbled because ... my mom and dad moved so far away.  [SIGH]  And all us -- my other sisters and I we still live [SIGH] h- here in Indiana.  [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]  O- o- oh!
L:  -- and I try not to say anything like that because she kind of gives me this look and it's like, at least I can pick up the phone and call my dad any time I w- want.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, I -- I have to realize that I have a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to be grateful for.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  You know.
R:  Well, but still they're so far away, though.
L:  Yeah, they are.  But they do come to visit and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- it's a nice trip for the boys and us to go too.  But [SIGH] -- so h- holidays, you know, when you're single can be kind of -- kind of hard ... you know, don't you think?
R:  It's true.  It's -- it's -- and my favorite Christmas actually sometimes can be hard.
L:  The most bitter.  Absolutely.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I hear you.  In fact Christmas Day [SIGH] I always, um, even if it's "m- my holiday" 'cause in a dumb divorce situation the boys go back and forth, back and forth.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, wow, --
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, that's the neighbor kids.
R:  That's hard too.
L:  That -- you probably heard my doorbell.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, I did. Ye- --
L:  Well, the neighbor kinds they -- I k- keep having to tell them -- the boys are with their dad for another week and da, da, da, da, da.  [LAUGH]
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  But anyway Christmas Day since, um, [LIPSMACK] my o- other sister and her family goes, you know, to see, [NOISE] um, her husband's side and then my other sister she's +single [NOISE] -- well CJ, they're not going to be home for another ... f- four days.  Okay.  [NOISE]  Bye!  [NOISE]  Hi, baby, I'm just on, um, a long distance call.  I'll be free in a minute.  Okay?  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry about that.  [LAUGH]
R:  O- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, anyway my long winded story is that Christmas Day I'm usually, you know, it's a choice I guess, I'm alone because I -- I want my boys to go spend time with [SIGH] my ex's, um, f- family that's in town [NOISE] and they all get together that day.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  And, ah, it would just --
