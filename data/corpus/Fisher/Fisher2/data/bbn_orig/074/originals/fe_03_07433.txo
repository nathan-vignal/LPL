L:  Good evening.  My name is May[?].
R:  Good evening.  My name is Joan[?].
L:  Hi, Joan.  How are you?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  Where --
L:  Where are you calling from?
R:  Ah, Dallas.  Where are you from?
L:  Oh, I'm in Toronto, Canada.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, do you watch reality TV?
L:  No, I don't because I hardly watch TV at all.  Do you?
R:  Ah, no.
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I watched the first show of Survivor and -- and didn't watch it, but I -- I do read about it.  Have you been reading -- keeping up with it?
L:  I haven't been keeping up, but it's very hard to listen to the radio without hearing, um, someone talking about it and I sort of know more or less what it -- what it's about.
R:  Well, I think it's the stupidest thing in the world and I think what it is, is showing people who -- who really don't have any --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I mean, can you imagine finding a mate that way?
L:  But they get a million dollars don't they?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Yes, but I mean, you have --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- no privacy.  I mean, it's just ridiculous.  Um, I -- I was surprised -- this last one with the bachelor --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Andrew Firestone --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- ah, I -- I met him as a young boy --
L:  Really?
R:  -- because I'm from California and they're a nice family.  They're a sweet family, he's a [LAUGH] nice boy.
L:  And you know him?
R:  Well, I -- I -- I knew him -- y- yes, because of California --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- I knew him as a little boy at --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- fourteen, fifteen years.  He was a sweet boy, sweety family.  So, of all the people to have to do this, I found extraordinarily dumb.
L:  Right.  Let me put you on hold for one quick second [NOISE].  Hi -- it's funny, I got another call from Fisher[?] to do a reality thing.  Whatever. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh [LAUGH] you're popular.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, oh -- it's -- it's amazing that you actually know somebody who was -- ah, wow, interesting.
R:  Ah, but everyone else -- ah, from what I understand, it's just so fake --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- it -- ah, don't you think it's fake getting a mate that way?
L:  Right.  Because I remember the first one -- ah, the Darla person --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, sh- -- it didn't work out well. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that -- she was awful.
L:  But -- she was a nurse, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, she was awful on the show?
R:  Well, she married him, remember?
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah and then she annulled it right away.
R:  I mean, how -- how wicked, how cruel.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] For a million dollars people do a lot of -- do funny things.
R:  Oh, w- w- why would someone do that for a million dollars?  I --
L:  Beats working.
R:  It -- it beats working?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that it?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I -- well, they're the type of people who would probably go through a million dollars in two weeks.
L:  That's true too.  That's right.  Yeah.  You made a very good point right there.
R:  S- so, is there a connection between earning money and keeping it and winning money and losing it?
L:  I would imagine so.
R:  Ah -- but what is disturbing me is that these people are -- are elevated in consciousness as heroes and beautiful people.  I mean, the value system is rotten if that's how we view heroes and -- and beautiful people.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  Um, I think the value system -- well, you sound like an older person, like over --
R:  I'm fifty five.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, like over thirty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, so I -- um, I'm fifty, so like we do have different values than younger people.
R:  Oh.
L:  Which I feel -- yeah.
R:  I -- well, I can remember saying that about my mother. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  I can [LAUGH] remember telling her to her face, "We have a different value system".
L:  [LAUGH] Now, it's, ah [LAUGH] -- oh, yeah.  Okay.
R:  Ah -- which was true.  Did you feel that way?
L:  Yeah, that's true, but now, you know -- ah, now we're -- we're sort of on the, ah -- the [inaudible] set, so.  Um, you don't watch any of the reality TV?
R:  No, I don't have the time, but I -- I do w- -- ah, I do read it, you know, in the newspaper.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- I -- you know, I want to know.
L:  For sure.
R:  Ah, I -- it sounds like you're the same way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh! There was one program that I really liked and you might have witch- -- ah, watched it on PBS, it was reality TV, ah, from England and it was a couple that for three months, lived in an English manor and pretended they were -- lived in the Edwardian times.
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Ah -- and I think the English are also doing something like, they're -- they're pretending they're Romans or mediev- -- so, they're going back and reliving that time period.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Now, to me, that is really exciting, because that's historical and you're looking at another culture in another timeframe --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and what was funny about the English manor people was that, ah, the -- the lady and lord of the manor really got into it.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, yes they fell in love with their manor, but the butler and the scullery maid and the footman, they couldn't wait [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] -- they were exhausted.
L:  Oh, so the -- the foot maid re- really was -- that was her job?
R:  That was her job.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH] He -- so, h- -- so, they -- they lived a life for three months of a -- on an English manor and I think something like forty servants.
L:  Oh, my God.  I think I could handle that.
R:  Well -- but the -- but the butler said something very interesting.  He said, "I could not -- I was [inaudible] -- I was the [inaudible] and he was a professional architect in real life --"
L:  Okay.
R:  -- "I could not tell the lord and lady the truth of what was going on in the kitchen --"
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- I had to be the conduit to making it all a lovely thing for them --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- to -- to smooth it out" and he said, "I realise that there was no communication without truth --
L:  Okay.
R:  "-- and that they had no idea the lies we led".
L:  Really?
R:  And I thought, "Well, that's a class thing if there ever was one".
L:  That's true.
R:  And I never thought of it that way, but we don't have that now.
L:  Ah, true.  Not in, ah, North America.
R:  You need to talk -- [several inaudible words] an aggressive, ah, bully American here.  We need to hear your voice.
L:  Oh, okay.  Um -- yeah, I think reality TV -- um, I think maybe in a few years reality TV will just, um, fade away.  Like how we had the game shows, um, a few years back, that were very popular --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, I -- I think it may just be a passing fad, ah, with, ah, television viewers, because people do get tired of -- ah, people do get tired.
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I know they're interested in your accent, that's why I'm trying to make you talk.
L:  Oh, I see.  Oh, okay.  Um -- ah, I live in Toronto, you've probably heard of Toronto as the SARS of the w- -- of North America.
R:  I had family who lived in Toronto.  My family came over from Scotland and settled in Toronto.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yes, I love Toronto.
L:  Have you been to Toronto recently or?
R:  No, I've --
L:  No.
R:  -- been dying to go.  We left for the warmer climate -- we left and lived in California, there was asthma.
L:  Okay.
R:  Ah, but we -- we lived -- we -- my family is -- the Alexander's[?] are from, ah, Toronto and -- and Webley[?] College [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, that's a nice, ah -- okay, that's an upscale, um, institution.
R:  It -- well, they -- that's what they did, they were teachers.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, ah, what do you do in Toronto?
L:  I'm actually -- I'm -- I've been unemployed so I don't do very much of anything.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, the economy's good but not that good.  Unfortunately, all my friends are also in the same, um, boat --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um --
R:  What did you --
L:  -- what'd you do in, um -- in Dallas?
R:  Well, I got laid off from Nortel, one of your companies. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] funny, I'm -- I'm ex Nortel, you know?
R:  No?
L:  Yeah!  I was, ah, laid off in nineteen ninety one, I was, um -- yeah. [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, how funny.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I'm -- yeah, I was -- ah, all my friends are ex Nortel people also --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, when I was at Nortel I went down to Richardson a lot.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's where I am.
L:  Okay.
R:  How funny.
L:  So, it's a very small world.  So, you -- when were you laid off from Nortel?
R:  Ah, two thousand and one --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- I left my marriage, got laid off from Nortel and I've started teaching.
L:  Oh, excellent.
R:  So, I'm teaching at [inaudible] -- at colleges here, English and humanities and things.
L:  Are you a teacher by trade or what?
R:  No, I was a Project Manager [LAUGH] at Nortel.
L:  And you could just leap into, ah, teaching.
R:  Well, I have a degree in English and -- and humanities --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which I'd never used and a master.  So, I was able to just make another career jump.
L:  Oh, you're lucky, you're very smart.
R:  I think -- and I tell my students that, have two things going for you.  Get double majors, you never know.
L:  That's true too.
R:  So, what did you do at Nortel?
L:  I was in product management --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I think I spent, ah, two weeks in, um -- in Dallas --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I remember going to the, ah, Fort Worth Zoo one Sunday morning and I was kind of disappointed because there was like very few animals and I figured out it cost me five cents per animal [NOISE], to -- to look at [LAUGH] -- it came out to five cents per animal.
R:  You went to the zoo?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm so sorry.  It's a terrible zoo.
L:  It is.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] Forth Worth is a little bit better, but that's pretty terrible too.  You need to go to San Diego.
L:  Well, yeah [LAUGH] but I happened --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to have been in your neck of the worlds that week.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah.  You know, I had nothing to do, I went to the zoo and it just was not a nice -- I mean, Toronto has a nice zoo, but our zoo's like twenty dollars admission, like it's not cheap.  But --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- we have a lot of animals --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- whereas the Forth Worth Zoo, I think -- the admission was quite inexpensive, however --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, for the number of animals I saw that were not, you know, like farm animals or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or, you know, domesticated animals, ah -- yeah, it came out to like five cents per animal. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's so funny.  That's so -- well, I went up to Ottawa on Nortel's time.  I fell --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- in love with Ottawa.  Ooh!
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Oh, it's the most beautiful city.
L:  So, you --
R:  And there was balloons in the sky.
L:  Okay
