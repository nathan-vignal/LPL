R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Um, my name's Courtney[?], I guess. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I'm Caitlyn[?].
L:  Okay.  So, reality TV? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, do you watch it?
R:  Um, yeah, I definitely [LAUGH] watched it a lot when it was -- first started to come out, but not really lately.
L:  Same.  I don't really watch any shows like consistently.  Like sometimes I'll tune into The Bachelor or something like that but ...
R:  So, um, why do you think reality -- these [LAUGH] TV shows are popular?  I guess --
L:  Um.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess just because it's not, ah -- not actors.  I don't know, but like when I watch it that's not really what I'm thinking, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd, ah --
R:  I think they can like identify with the people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because like when it's actors like they're totally different type of like person and you know like they have a lot of money and like they're getting paid for it and --
L:  And they're acting.
R:  -- they have like a really good life. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like just regular people -- like to watch them like you have more in common with them and ...
L:  I think too like a lot of the shows like, um -- like Bachelorette and, ah, all those, you know, shows about -- like the marrying and everything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like there something you'd never do yourself and, um, just to see like other people do it's kind of --
R:  Yeah, because it's like --
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  -- something that the -- like you would only really do like for a million dollars --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- or whatever.
L:  Although I wouldn't do it for a million dollars but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I wouldn't either. [LAUGH] Like I refuse to watch the one like where -- I don't know what it's called but like where they have the audience pick who they marry --
L:  Really?  I haven't even seen that one.
R:  Like Married By America, I think that's what it was.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I was just like, "That's going way too far". [LAUGH]
L:  I couldn't watch, um, Temptation Island.
R:  Oh, that was horrible.
L:  That was a little [inaudible].  Yeah.  They were trying --
R:  [several inaudible words] too.
L:  -- break them up. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah and like then --
L:  It was almost painful to watch, I thought.  I mean, like these people were just like destroying their lives.  I don't know.
R:  Like, yeah in front of thous- -- millions of viewers and stuff.
L:  What I don't get is -- like if you're on a show like that, how you could ever think that you'd ever get a date again.  Like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if anyone [LAUGH] ever saw the show they'd know you were --
R:  Well, [several inaudible words] like -- some people act so like -- they do like a lot of risque things on there and like I know for me, if my family was watching [LAUGH] that show --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- like I would be totally humiliated.  But that's something that you -- that's private.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?  Like if you had no family and no like -- nothing to do in life, like maybe that would be a reason [LAUGH] to, um -- and humiliate yourself, but ....
L:  Yeah, I'd agree you have to be pretty desperate.  I -- I --
R: Um.
L:  -- so, I guess we haven't really [LAUGH] -- like I don't -- I don't really know why they're so popular.  They just are something new, I think.
R:  I think that like I [inaudible] -- I'm busy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I really like The Real World --
L:  Oh, yeah.  Same.
R:  -- because like -- that was like the original thing and even though I know like that's not the real world --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I still really liked it, I don't really know why I liked it, but I just really did because like that's something that I could like sit down and watch.  Like I could watch the marathon's that are on in the weekends, because they're like -- really like dramatic and stuff and -- but like now it's like really starting to get annoying.  Like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I really am annoyed by like watching like all these regular people that think like -- that they're like talking about their feelings and like, "Well, I think that I really don't [several inaudible words]" and like I'm just sick of it.  Like I don't care about [LAUGH] anymore.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Like I have my own [LAUGH] life.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's really like expensive to pay actors and I like went -- like I -- whenever -- like we had a talk about this in like some of my classes at school and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were -- like teachers were saying how like, um, they make so much more money off of it because they don't have to pay those people --
L:  Yeah, I bet.
R:  -- like the cost to make the sure is like so --
L:  A million dollars. [LAUGH]
R:  -- huge.
L:  [LAUGH] You pay someone when they marry someone else.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but that's actually like cheaper than to pay actors --
L:  Yeah, I'm sure.
R:  -- and stuff.
L:  Ah, I would [several inaudible words] Real World, I think, is still -- definitely is the best on, I would agree with you.  I don't -- I don't quite know why either, you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like I just can't put my finger on it but it's just better than the other.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know either, I just like the format of it and I l- -- [several inaudible words] they always end up taking like interesting people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I actually got to meet the wo- -- um, did you watch New Orleans at all?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I met Nat Smith, the one that was really religious.
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] really blonde hair --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] spoke at this retreat I went to. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's the only reality star I ever really met. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh.
R:  It seems like you would meet a lot more though, because there's so many people.
L:  So many ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I think the worst one -- well, I've already said like five that I think are the worst ones --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but like I can't watch Fear Factor.  I think that's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- just like absolutely disgusting the things they make --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- I don't see why anyone would watch that.
R:  Did you see [several inaudible words] when they ate the bugs and stuff?
L:  Yeah, that's like every show. [LAUGH]  No, the worst --
R:  [several inaudible words] watch it like once and that's what I saw [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
L:  The worst was -- um, they --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- put them in this like pit and let just rats crawl all over them for like five minutes or no --
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  -- it was whoever could last the longest.  Like --
R:  And who would do that?
L:  -- and make -- they came out with all these rat bites on them.  Like, I don't know -- I mean, I just saw it on the commercial, like I don't know why you would ever see people like put themselves in a rat pit to be eaten alive.  Like --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- that's just disgusting.
R:  How do they find these people, because I wouldn't do that for money?
L:  No.  No.
R:  Like I wouldn't even do it for fame, I would just like --
L:  And it's --
R:  -- [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- I think the thing is on Fear Factor too, it's not even a million dollars.  I think it's like a hundred thousand dollars --
R:  Are you serious? [LAUGH]
L:  -- not to say like [LAUGH] that's not that much.  I mean, that's a lot of money but there's no way. [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Yeah, I don't even think I could put a price on that.  I don't know what would make -- what would convince me that that was worth [LAUGH] doing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Agreed.
R:  I really hate like dating shows [several inaudible words] and I think the -- the one show that is -- like I don't know if they're considered reality shows, but the one, um -- I can't remember what it's called, um, but I heard like that it was totally like rigged or whatever you call it.  Like it was -- they're actors and stuff --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and like a lot of that could be the same with some of the reality shows like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when they get like crazy people on there, like they might just not even be real, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that may not be their real --
L:  Personality.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I can't imagine -- like just -- like I know I wouldn't be myself if I had a camera following me around all the time.
R:  Oh, [inaudible].
L:  I mean, I don't see how anyone really could.  I -- it's just -- I -- to me, it just seems impossible.  Like I could just imagine --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- like if I got in a fight with someone or -- or like I would just turn to the camera and start like -- do you know what I me- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like trying to explain myself to the audience.  I just --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L: -- [several inaudible words] it doesn't seem like anyone's being real on any of the shows, but ...
R:  I know, like I [several inaudible words] Real World and stuff and I -- I really feel like it's genuine, but then I'm like, "What if I was there like and I put myself in their position?" and I'm like, "I could never do that".  Like I would feel so nervous I would have to -- like you know how you're kind of like a little bit different around everyone you know, like you're not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- exactly the same person to your best friend as you are to like your parents and like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you would be on -- and like in front of the entire like country not knowing, like, which side of you is -- like to act -- like -- like you wouldn't -- like you wouldn't want to like -- be like trying to find, like, a guy on a show like that when, like, your parents --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm like -- I don't know, it's just like I wouldn't really know how to act at all. [LAUGH]
L:  And they always are, um, like, dressed perfectly, like with makeup on. [LAUGH]
R:  I know, how is that possible?
L:  I [LAUGH] -- I --
R:  I always wondered. [LAUGH] Like those girls are so perfect and like they're not even like actors and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I always wondered that too.
L:  I was like -- we always -- my friends [LAUGH] and I were talking the other day about -- they -- like they must just give them all those clothes when they go on the show because --
R:  [several inaudible words] I thought -- like they must have a makeup artist because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I went on there -- no one would wanna watch me if I woke up in the morning --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or something, like --
L:  Agree.  Yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] I don't know.
L:  And some days you just wanna wear like your pajama pants until noon, you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you don't wanna put on -- I don't know ...
R:  You'd always have to look cute [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or try to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's weird.  I really think they have, like, makeup artists or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The guys really don't need em, but I think they're taking it a little too far with all the, like, reunions though.  They --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] I don't really care about seeing Puck anymore.  I hated him --
L:  Puck is --
R:  -- the first --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- season or whatever season he was in and [several inaudible words] --
L:  That was like ten years ago, you'd think the poor guy would like just move on with his life.
R:  I know, it's like they don't -- once you're on that show, like, that's all you're known for and, like, everyone knows who you are and like -- because I was reading -- Melissa from New Orleans like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I don't know, like she's -- um
