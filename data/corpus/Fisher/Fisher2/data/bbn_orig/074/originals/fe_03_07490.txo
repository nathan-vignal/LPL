L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?
L:  [NOISE]  Hello?  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi!
R:  [SIGH]  I didn't think anyone was there for a minute.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  N- no, well it took them a while to get through a- and then I, -- you know, anyway my name's Audrey [NOISE] and I'm in Los Angeles, --
R:  Hi, my name's --
L:  -- Hollywood.
R:  -- Annette and I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Atlanta, Georgia?
R:  Yes.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay, so we're supposed to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're -- the topic is holidays, --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- favorite holidays.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, what's your favorite holiday?
L:  [NOISE]  Well, my favorite holiday was, ah, in Cannes, South of France.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, some time ago I -- I stayed with a friend who had a, [SIGH] -- ah, what is, ah, called a Morgan sports car.  I don't think they s- sell them in America.  [SIGH]  But, ah, it's a little, -- ah, a little c- car that goes in and out of the winding --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- roads, you know, ah, leading up from Cannes up to Monaco.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it was great.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was great.  The food was great.  [SIGH]  My friend's l- little house --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- was great.  [SIGH]  The -- the -- the night rides were great.  I didn't do any gambling or anything like that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What was your -- what was your favorite holiday?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  U- um, [MN] well I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I was thinking it was going to be more -- I was thinking more along the lines of Christmas and Easter, and all that.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  O- oh!  O- oh!  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but a vacation is a holiday as well.  So, a- ah, see now that you -- now that you bring --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that up, now my -- I -- I kind of m- may have to change --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause originally I was thinking my, [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] along the cr- -- the line of Christmas, 'cause I love Christmas but now I'm thinking [SIGH] --
L:  No, you're --
R:  -- I've had some --
L:  -- probably right.  I'm English and we always call a vacation a holiday so I --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- mistook it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] but my -- my favorite is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is Christmas 'cause [NOISE] mainly I think, um, [SIGH] just all the +traditions that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my parents had and that now that I have a family that I'm now creating for my children.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it's not so much, you know, the p- presents aspect of it but it's just kind of, like, the family time --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [MN] that means a lot to me.  And just [SIGH] the +traditions of, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- getting together and m- -- and -- and making cookies and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just all the preparations.  I love d- decorating [LAUGH] the house and, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, getting the tree up and getting --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all my, [SIGH] you know, a- all the ornaments I have.  There's, ah, a lot of 'em I've gotten from my p- parents.  Um, my -- actually both my parents are now die -- have died and [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's just so -- it's very sentimental --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to me each year when I put 'em up, [MN] [SIGH] you know, remembering --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ornaments and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things like that or -- or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- decorations that I'd gotten --
L:  Remembering past -- past -- past Christmases and you --
R:  Exactly.
L:  Uh-hum.  Uh-hum.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Those kind of -- I guess it's just -- is just very m -- it -- memory filled.  And then also just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I have three small c- children so it's just a lot of fun [SIGH] you know, just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seeing ... Christmas mirrored in their faces [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] as well.  So, ... that's kind of ...
L:  Well -- well wh- when it comes to a choice of holidays as being, ah, special occasions for part of the year, I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would have to say Christmas too, [SIGH] because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there isn't much.  There's Easter, Christmas ... [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- ah, the, ah, a- ah, Bank Holiday.  What -- what is it called?  I -- [SIGH] well the different -- a- ah, you know, in the mid- -- in the middle of August or the end of August I -- but really --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, late.  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- there aren't many, y- you know.  So, I guess Christmas would be the top favorite, you know?
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, well, yeah, 'cause I mean you think about it, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Easter -- although, you know, we have fun at Easter too, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, with Easter egg hunts.  And [SIGH] that has become more memorable now since I've had children.  [SIGH]  Um, --
L:  Do you live -- do you live in a -- a -- do you live surrounded by a lot -- country -- you know, ah, grass and -- and fields and --
R:  W- well, n- n- no, we're kind of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- m- more in -- I mean a -- a suburb of Atlanta.  [SIGH]
L:  So, you go to a local --
R:  It's a little different from LA.
L:  -- so you --
R:  It's not -- it's probably -- yes, it's probably a little more green than --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- LA but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Do you go to a local park for your Easter hunts and things and egg --
R:  Well, no, actually, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, [LIPSMACK] we go -- my husband is from South Carolina [SIGH] and his mom still lives there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so we go over there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And she lives in [SIGH] -- basically, it's kind of a f- farm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- area [SIGH] and she has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this huge --
L:  Which is great for --
R:  -- house and --
L:  -- the kids.
R:  -- and, yeah, -- and land and [SIGH] so we have a huge Easter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- egg hunt.  And it's just -- it's -- ah, it's a blast.  [NOISE]
L:  But you don't kill the poor chickens in front of the children for [LAUGH] --
R:  No!  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for dinner?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  No, no, no, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no, no, no.  [SIGH]  And it's -- it's -- and they don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- she's -- at this point --
L:  [NOISE]  -- she doesn't do any of that any more.  They used to, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but not any more.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Now what b- brought you over --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to ... Los Angeles?
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, a whole chain of e- events.  U- u- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and then I -- I've been here twenty five years.
R:  Oh, okay.  But you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] still have an [NOISE] accent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's why I was [NOISE] --
L:  I know.  I know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's -- i- it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- extraordinary that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I still have an --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- accent, but [SIGH] I think, um, [SIGH] that the English accent seems to be the hardest to lose.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because all -- every time I open my mouth almost, somebody says --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "Where are you from?" and I don't think I have an accent anymore, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, because [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- when I speak with English people [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I can hear the difference.  You know, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- English people [SIGH] just arrived or [NOISE] in England --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] they -- th- -- they -- I do -- to them I -- my -- to their ear I sound American.  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But, um, something I -- I would pronounce a T or a D or something else.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  The other day I said, [NOISE] "See you later" to someone and they said, [SIGH] "Oh, I can tell you're from England 'cause you said later" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I said, "Oh, ah, --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- I should have said 'later'".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, right, [LAUGH] slot it all together.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you have a lovely accent.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm enjoying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- talking [LAUGH] with you and just listening to your voice.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, w- well, that's n- nice to hear.
R:  It's just very mel- -- v- very melodic.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Yes, I thought I was going to be a singer at one time but, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I -- I'm just too lazy and I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- didn't go through with it.  [SIGH]
R:  Now, what part of Los Angeles are you living in?
L:  I'm living in Hollywood.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  O- oh, wow!  So, you are in the heart of [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that area.  [LIPSMACK]  I used to --
L:  I am.  [NOISE]
R:  -- I used to, um, ... travel to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- California.  [SIGH]  In fact, um, [LIPSMACK] at one point I was there [SIGH] for a month setting up a warehouse so I -- and I had friend who lived down in Newport, [SIGH] well, Newport Beach.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And so on weekends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would go down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and see her and just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- s- so I spent a long time in that area and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] [SIGH] somewhat familiar with it.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Well, it's just convenient for me because it's a place, u- um, [SIGH] you can live and -- and -- you know, in England everyone is -- e- everyone has always made a lot of fuss of me all my life.  And, ah, [SIGH] always been so concerned about my life, my interests a- ah, you know, and me.  [SIGH]  And it's always been a bit overpowering [SIGH] so I like Hollywood because nobody gives a damn about a- anything.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nobody cares if I live or die.  Nobody cares if I'm sick.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, ah, [SIGH] you know, I feel [SIGH] a freedom --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I never felt in England.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Because in England I'm surrounded by --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] people who care and I -- I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I can't handle it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I can't handle it.  It's too much for me.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, no, I know -- I know what you feeling, I -- I mean I can understand your t- thoughts in that regard.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we're all very different.  You know, [NOISE] if --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I had a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I had close family ties and everything, it'd probably be quite different [SIGH] but, um, since I don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- t- there is -- there was nothing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really to keep me in England, you know.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  So, [SIGH] um, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- t- the sun in California sounded so tempting.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, ah, then I happened to marry an American --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, ah, --
R:  So, it --
L:  -- but he was a New Yorker but anyway, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- ah, he was living in -- he came -- we came to California and then he went back off to ... New York --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and all his --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- nefarious dealings.  [SIGH]  And I stayed, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, because I -- I liked the sun and I like -- I just like -- I like [SIGH] -- I like the artificiality, the fakery of Hollywood.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I love it.
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I really do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've always been attracted by fake -- fakeness and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fake people.  [SIGH]  I find them very interesting, whereas I found -- [SIGH] find real people to be kind of dull.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  You know, I mean [SIGH] this is because I -- I'm warped, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  If I -- if I was normal I would find the family life and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the closeness of it and [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the inter relationships --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] to be very -- [SIGH] very fascinating.  But I -- I -- I've seen all that so I like this other kind of [SIGH] strange weird -- a- a- ah, pecul- -- you know, the -- the [NOISE] insanity of -- of Hollywood.
R:  Of it all.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm, I do.
R:  Now, what do you do in LA?
L:  [NOISE]  I don't do anything right now.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I used to be, um, a legal secretary for some time.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, I worked with, um, [NOISE] an attorney, a female attorney who had contracts with the RTD and, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and some private ... um, [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- c- clients [SIGH] and, ah, basically y- y- you know, did legal work.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Because again the cases are interesting I--
R:  R- right.
L:  -- and so it -- it -- [SIGH] you're reading a story every time you read a complaint, you know.  And I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I also majored in journalism [SIGH] so I'm a frustrated writer.
R:  [LAUGH]  Now, have you print -- or have you gotten anything published?  [SIGH]
L:  N- no, a couple of articles but I'm -- as I said, I'm extremely lazy.  [SIGH]  There is something lacking.  [SIGH]  I think if people had not helped me all my life.  If they had said [SIGH] "Okay", at a certain age "Now you've got to get out there and do this and ..." [SIGH] but nobody ever said that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, for some reason I've grown up extremely lazy.  [NOISE]  Um, ...
R:  But somehow you're able to live so how are you able to do that?  [SIGH]
L:  W- well, I get a -- I get, um, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I do get, [NOISE] a- ah, retirement money.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]  And -- which is not a lot --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] but, um, [NOISE] ... i- it -- i- i- i- it [NOISE] -- my -- my -- my ba- -- okay, I don't know why I'm discussing -- saying all this, but the thing is [SIGH] my whole problem is -- lack of ambition.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Lack of ambition.  [SIGH]  And, um, ... oh, well, n- never mind I was going --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, but I mean --
L:  -- I was going to say something and then I thought, "No" because [SIGH] you're not use to m- -- to -- to a certain, -- you know, to -- to c- -- to the unorthodox way of life [SIGH] so therefore, [SIGH] um, I don't want to [NOISE] a- a- ah, shock -- frighten, horrify you.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I don't know but, ah, I don't know if you could do that but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] but I mean it's just like what you say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lack of ambit- --
