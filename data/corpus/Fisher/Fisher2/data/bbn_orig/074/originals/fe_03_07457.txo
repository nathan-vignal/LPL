R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Ah, I understand that our topic is a discussion on reality shows.
L:  Right.
R:  Do you watch them?
L:  I watch reality shows, yes.  Do you?
R:  Ah, I do not but I read about them and, um, I -- I also -- I think that How to Marry a Millionaire or How to --
L:  Right, How to Marry a Millionaire.
R:  -- um, it isn't something, ah -- I -- I suppose the fact that I don't watch them is also of importance to this, ah, conversation that we have.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Is that correct?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, why do you watch them?
L:  I think it's, um, interesting because, ah, you do get involved with the different personalities of the people, [MN] um, and, ah, you're kind of following a story line, like, if you watch the Bachelor or the Bachelorette they're dating a different person out of the group every week, um, and --
R:  You sound like you're young enough to be dating, ah, or the dating age.  Are you?
L:  No, I'm forty.
R:  You're for- -- that's -- well, that's young.  [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, okay, go on.
L:  So, um, you know, and it's a form of, ah, escapism TV, um, [MN] ah, so I, yeah, I think it does have its merits.  Um, i- it's probably also a fad, um ...
R:  Yes, I think it is too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think it's going to survive.
L:  No, because they -- they keep, you know, coming up with a -- a -- a different, um, pushing the envelope a little bit more, like, someone's going to win a million dollars but no one knows for s- -- everyone knows that and the next show is, [MN] um, ah, you know, the -- the bachelor doesn't know that the woman is going to win the million dollars or Joe Millionaire was the show where, um, [LIPSMACK] ah, they thought he was a millionaire but he wasn't, so ... it- it's interesting.
R:  [MN] Well, ah, my -- my objection, I mean, one of them is, ah, I think the whole thing is based on insincerity and, um, I -- I can just find almost any other program on television, ah, more worthwhile.  I know that may sound snobbish but, [MN] um, [MN] I always think that -- that dating and men's and women's relationships were very important, ah, to me and of -- and of great interest and they still are even though I'm an old woman --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they very much are but, ah, I see how sort of distant from reality they -- they really are and, um, there's a phoniness to it that --
L:  There is, d- -- I mean --
R:  -- that is almost just, to -- to me, it's just a waste of time, [MN] and I think, well, I think I've said.
L:  Yeah, well, wh- what was their second question?  Do you ...?
R:  Well, it was sort of, ah, about the, ah, one was the reality show and two was the millionaire show.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I consider those to be one and the same.
L:  Right, right.  No, I do and -- [MN] and, ah -- I mean, I think i- it's pretty evident that -- that, um, these are phoney and i- in the sense that it's very rare that you could meet someone and -- and quickly get to know them or quickly decide that that person, you know, should be your life partner. [MN]
R:  Do you think it's like a, um, vicarious experience for people who watch it?
L:  Yeah, I think it is because, you know, they, well, you haven't seen it but, you know, they often send, ah, like on the Bachelor they -- or Millionaire, they'll send the couple out on a, you know, a date [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like some sort of fantasy date and --
R:  Yeah, where -- somebody where you're sort of, like, a little bit of voyeurism or you could watch.
L:  Right, or you're saying, Boy, that would be fun to do some day", or, you know ...
R:  I th- -- I think it's also hooked up to our whole, um, [MN] would you say, involvement with celebrity, even though these people are not really celebrities, ah, they are simply by being on television and we love to watch [MN] celebrities.
L:  Right, and -- and --
R:  It's so removed from what is really, you know, talk about reality, this is so far removed from reality.
L:  Right, you're making celebrities out of --
R:  Nobody.
L:  -- average --
R:  Nobodies.
L:  Joes.  Right.
R:  [MN] Out of jerks. [MN]
L:  Right, right.  So, it, ah, [LIPSMACK] and -- and I guess that's part of the fad too because, you know, the newspapers are filled with, ah, ar- articles about, ah, American Idol which is a reality singing show.  Um, [LIPSMACK] and, ah, that's somewhat different in the sense that these people do have real talent, um, [MN] and, ah, you know, ah, i- it's another form of entertainment, I guess.
R:  Ah, there's a lot of it when I scan the, ah, television logs I find that, um, so many of the spaces of the -- the hours and the times of the days are filled with similar type programs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- rather than, you know, something kind of original.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, and, um, I find that, um, disappointing.  I don't know what -- what you look for when you, ah, look for television.  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling from, ah, Philadelphia.
R:  I'm in Los Angeles.
L:  Oh, wow.  [MN]
R:  I'm in -- I'm in the heart of it.
L:  LA.  Mhm.
R:  And I even, I have family who's in the movie business, so [MN] ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, I still -- I still feel this way and they do too.
L:  Right, right.  Well, I guess -- do you think it's also, um, [MN] I guess this may be a cheap form of entertainment or --
R:  You bet.
L:  -- or programming.
R:  You bet it's cheap.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Nobody has to -- you bet it's cheap.  They just have to go out on the street and find -- find the people and, ah, it's -- it's -- it's nothing that one would care to look at again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] once it's there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um -- [MN] but, you know, it evidently, um, draws in huge crowds on whatever is the -- the Nielsen ratings or whatever the ratings are that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that they go by, so, evidently a lot of people think that it's fun and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they look forward to it.
L:  Yeah, as I said, I -- I do enjoy some of them.  I mean, um, [MN] I never really enjoyed the Survivor type where it's physical, you know, they're building huts on some deserted island.  I mean, I -- I -- that didn't intrigue me but I guess the more personality driven ones were -- you know, even though it is very phoney and they're just going on dates and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they're trying to pick a mate --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- let's say --
R:  Are you familiar with the Anna Nicole Show?
L:  [MN] Ah, yeah, I have not seen that show but --
R:  Is that called a reality show 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they follow her around with a camera?
L:  Right, right, and they, um --
R:  It's a -- it's a monstrosity.  [LAUGH]
L:  I've not seen that one.  Did p- --
R:  It is --
L:  Have you?
R:  -- terrible.  It's just almost, um, [MN] what shall I say?  A -- a -- a travesty that this is put on television 'cause it's nothing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's quite a bore and, ah, if that's a reality show, my God, who needs it?
L:  Right.  Well, I guess that- that's also similar to the, um, Osbourne show.  Have you seen that or ...?
R:  The Osbourne show.  I did see it.  I watched it.  Um, I was in the hospital when Mrs Osbourne was in the hospital --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I mean, not myself --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but just, ah, ah, but, ah, I -- I, ah, I do know about this show.  I have seen it and I think it's a little different, just slightly different.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it still is something, after I've seen it once or twice I have no desire to go back to it.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't -- I don't feel that they're -- that they're --
L:  Well, I guess -- I guess the appeal for that was that, I mean, and I'm not a fan of his but I guess, you know, he's this hard rock singer and, you know, ah, heavy metal or something and -- and yet at home he's just the dad that takes out trash and ...
R:  Well, he's not really just the dad who takes out trash 'cause his daughter, Kelly, just bought a multi million dollar home in Los Angeles --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- and she's eighteen years old.
L:  Mhm.  And she -- and she -- she was in Philadelphia a couple of weeks ago at some club, you know, so sh- she's eighteen and touring the country and --
R:  And what does she do, sing?
L:  She sings, yeah, mhm.
R:  And so, y- -- s- -- m- --
L:  Well, it's easier to start a career when, you know --
R:  When your father's Ozzy Osbourne?
L:  Right, and you're in the news and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, on TV.  So, she's this year's it girl, I guess. [MN] Um, but th- they're making stars out of, ah, nobodies and --
R:  That's right.  These are nobodies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I feel that it's kind of, um, of a trick, cheap trick, played --
