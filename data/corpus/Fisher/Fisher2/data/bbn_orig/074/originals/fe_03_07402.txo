R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  My name is Lauren.  I'm in Tucson, Arizona.
L:  Oh, I'm Fred from, um -- f- from Florida, from, uh, Fort Lauderdale.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Uh, nice to meet you.  I -- I usually talk to, uh, you know, men.  But now I -- I'm talking to women.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know what -- what is the status on this.  But --
R:  Is this the first ...?
L:  -- but I usually, uh, men to men, in the -- or I -- now I -- is this the first time you're talking to a person, uh -- a man or is it ...?
R:  Um, this is my second call and the first time I talked to a woman.  So ...
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see.
R:  I think they just take whoever is available I guess.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  All right.  Now, the topic was -- was -- what was the topic again?  I -- I -- I was driving, you know, in my, uh, truck.
R:  Oh, okay.  It was kinda complicated actually.  It was what's worse?  And then it listed about six things.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Is -- is it smoking, drinking and, uh, something else?
R:  Yeah.  Gossiping, um, talking excessively I think it said, um, eating excessively and something else.
L:  What is the worst thing?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I -- I thought -- I thought maybe, uh, smoking is the worst thing, but I've never smoked anyway.  So ...
R:  Yeah, I don't smoke either.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Well, that's good, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I was going to say gossiping just 'cause it -- it affects other people I think the most.
L:  I see.
R:  You know, if you drink, uh -- if you drink too much or smoke -- smoking I guess affects other people, but like gossiping can really, really like hurt somebody else --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and if you eat -- you know, if you eat too much that's kinda your problem, like it's not really other people's problem.
L:  Right.
R:  That's kinda my thought.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, uh -- so you're in Arizona, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just three hours difference isn't that from the Eastern Standard Time?
R:  Yes.  Yes, it is.
L:  Ah.
R:  It's a little after five.
L:  So, you're about, uh, five twenty, something like that?
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, I'm at eight twenty right now.  So, um ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Uh, so, I guess -- I -- I -- I feel like -- I don't know -- maybe drinking too much or something like that that, um ...
R:  That can be bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what's the worst.  It's kinda strange.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but, uh ...
L:  I -- I don't drink excessive only, uh, maybe a few to, uh -- to be sociable with other people.  That's basically, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what I would do, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I don't have a tolerance for alcohol.  Actually I'm Asian so [LAUGH] I can't drink more than just one drink and -- without getting sick.  So ...
L:  Ah. What ...?
R:  I don't know what excessively is for me, but ...
L:  Oh, with the -- with the weight factor too, you know?
R:  Oh, actually I'm not as -- I'm not skinny though.  [LAUGH]
L:  You're not skinny?  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  The weight thing doesn't really -- I don't know -- I know people that are like half my size and they can drink so much more than I can.  So ...
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, so I guess other people though, you know, just obnoxious drunks, like that's pretty bad, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- peop- -- other people that drink too much.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I think that might be worse than smoking too much because people's behavior gets out of hand.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  I -- you know, I -- you know, I -- I like occasionally, maybe on the weekend, I would just go with some people and things like that to be sociable and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, we play some cards and then we have a few drinks --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's about it, you know?
R:  Yeah, that's fine.
L:  And you have some goodies and that's about it, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I -- you know, I don't go out excessive like, uh, some of these people they go to the bar scenes and it's like how do they put all these beers in --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- or -- and liquor away, you know?
R:  I know.  I know.  And it's so expensive too.  I don't know why, you know, it's so expensive.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  So, um --
R:  So ...
L:  -- are you still working?
R:  Um, I'm a student.
L:  Oh, you're a student?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I'm around that drinking stuff a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you have.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  How 'bout you?
L:  Yeah.  Are you -- you're on a landline, right, just a normal phone, right?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  I'm on a cellular phone right now.  How do you hear me?  Is it pretty clear?
R:  Um, it's not that bad.  It cuts out a little bit more than ...  The first call I did the woman was on a landline too and that's probably the best.  But, um, it's not that bad.  It's not that bad.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I see.
R:  Are you -- did you say you were driving right now?
L:  No.  I -- I stopped and I'm right now on the Wool Mart right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  In the parking lot --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- talking to you right now, you know?  But I was driving along the way, you know, and -- and -- and then the -- the topic was on something else at the beginning --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it just changed, you know --
R:  Well, I ...
L:  -- after the second conversation or whatever.
R:  [LAUGH] I think it said ...
L:  So, that's all right.
R:  It was real vague at first.  It was like the topic for the day is like personal habits I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then it went into like a specific question.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yesterday I did something with food, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Going out for food.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, my topic was, uh, outdoor activities.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we talked about the weather and stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, uh, y- you don't smoke then?
R:  No.  No.  I don't.
L:  That's good.  I never -- I never smoked too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's -- well -- and, you know, I've been -- you know, uh -- I've been retired already -- one year already.
R:  Oh, congratulations.
L:  Yeah.  I retired at fifty five.  So, um ...
R:  Nice.
L:  So, I -- I -- you know, when I'm talking to a student boy, that's young.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can say oh, I feel ancient now.
R:  Oh, no.  Well, I'm not an undergraduate.  I'm a graduate.  [LAUGH]
L:  But I don't look -- I don't look my age.  I don't look -- 
R:  Oh, good.
L:  -- about forty five.
R:  So, it's that good Florida, um -- Florida sun?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like Arizona.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  That's the dry, uh -- it -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the dry.  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what was that -- it was smoking and -- and alcohol and what was the other one?
R:  Well, one of them I think -- I think they said talking too much, which is kind of a funny one to bring up.
L:  Talking too much?
R:  Yeah.  I think they said talking too much.
L:  Really?  Gee.
R:  Well, I don't know what I think about that.  I mean, I guess it can be a little annoying, but it's not that bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I was just saying how could that be really bad?
R:  I mean ...
L:  Talking.  Well.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Or -- and then eating too much was the other one.
L:  Eating too much, yeah.  I just came from, um, uh, a buffet, a Chinese buffet, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it wasn't too bad.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I -- I tell ya I got ten percent discount on -- on the -- you know, because I'm a senior, over fifty.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, nice, very nice.
L:  So, it -- so it wasn't too bad, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was like about five dollars in change.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  So, um --
R:  All you can eat kinda thing. 
L:  -- and, you know, it -- it was something new.  I -- I love to try different things, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um --
R:  Especially food.
L:  -- but, you know, it's -- it's -- I only had a hot tea.  I didn't have alcohol.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's good.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I overeat a lot I think.  I just really like food, which is why I'm not real skinny.
L:  Well, I love it too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I love that too -- food, food, food, food.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  I think now that's the thing, uh, you know -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- stay alive.
R:  I know.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I don't think that's as bad as smoking too much or drinking too much.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what do you, uh -- you're a student.  What do you major in or are you d- -- or you're studying to be?
R:  Um, well, I'm actually studying linguistics, which is how I know about this study because I'm familiar with the -- the people that are putting it on.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I've actually done -- done some research that's, uh -- that was based on conversations like this.  So, um, I'm just kinda trying to do it from the other point of view, you know?  I've done the research- researcher point of view and now I'm --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- being one of the talkers.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  You see, my wife signed me up, right --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh -- and then, you know, I got a call on my cell phone and she forgot to tell me about this stuff here --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I go I'm talking to -- what is this, you know?  I don't know.  "Oh, I forgot to tell you about this" and I said --
R:  That's really funny.
L:  -- "Okay.  So, now I'm prepared now".  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.
L:  But I -- I didn't know.  I said, "Well, whose calling me?" you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she said, "Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're gonna be talking on the phone for ten -- or eight minutes and some- -- and then when somebody comes back calling you you've got thirty seconds to say goodbye".
R:  Yeah.  It's a nice way to get paid.  I think it's good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's good to talk to somebody, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, you know, it's -- it's like hey, they're in a different -- you know, different, um, climate or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- different time zone and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how's the weather there?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  And I just -- I just came from a rainstorm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which -- about -- you know, it's only a downpour for about five or ten minutes but, um --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- it's -- it's dry right now.  But, um ...
R:  I was actually stuck in Fort Lauderdale, the airport, a few weeks back, um ...
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  It was that huge one that came down like --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- eleven inches in an hour or something and, um --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- I was on my way to Porto Rico and I got stuck for like five hours in Fort Lauderdale.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  They -- they had a three hour flight delayed or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They closed --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- down the airport for three hours.  In fact I was in Pennsylvania when this happened --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- uh, all right and, um -- and, um [LIPSMACK], what I did was when I heard there was about eight inches of rain in -- you know, in a matter of a couple of hours --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they closed a lotta streets down and everything else --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and the airport was down for three hours.
R:  Yeah.  We were sitting on the tarmac for those three hours 'cause we had just boarded --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and then we couldn't -- they wouldn't let us get off the plane 'cause they wouldn't move the little runway because they couldn't turn it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- on legally and so we sat there on the plane for three hours.
L:  Oh, so you went to Porto Rico?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  For a vacation.
L:  Oh, for -- oh, for a vacation.  One week?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah, it was.
L:  I was in Pennsylvania for about a week.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's actually where I talked to someone last time.  She was from Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.
R:  So [LAUGH], it's a small world, small world.
L:  Ah, I see.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um -- so, Arizona, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Actually I know somebody in Arizona, uh, it's like a cousin in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Scottsville or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- something like that.
R:  That makes sense.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm in Tuscon.  So, that's about two hours away.
L:  Oh.
R:  But we're all in the desert together.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  In fact, um --
