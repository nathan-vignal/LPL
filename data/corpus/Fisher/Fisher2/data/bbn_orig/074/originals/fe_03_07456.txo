L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Sean.
L:  I'm Helen.
R:  So, ah, what do you think about reality TV?
L:  I don't -- I really hear more about 'em than I watch 'em.  I hear 'em from other people.  I don't -- I haven't watched.  I think maybe the first Survivor and I watch occa- -- I mean -- I've seen occasionally, like, Fear Factor or something but they kinda gross me out.
R:  Oh, Fear Factor's supposed to gross you out.
L:  Oh, well, it does gross you out.
R:  What about, like, um, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?
L:  I didn't watch any of it.  I kind of heard some recaps on the radio going to work, but ...
R:  Or Joe Millionaire, or, I don't know.
L:  Have you wa- --
R:  Did you ever watch any of The Real World?
L:  No.  Have you?
R:  Yeah, I've -- I watch all of 'em.  I like 'em.
L:  You watch all of 'em?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I'm a big fan.
L:  Well, well, what do you like about 'em?
R:  Oh, you get to peer in on other people's lives and relate to how you personally would react in the same situations and, you know, see who's the weird one, you or them.  Know what I mean? [MN] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] What do you -- what do you think about this show, ah, For Love or Money?  You heard about that one?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] is that where, like, the girls are trying to get the guy and they'd do anything?
R:  Pretty much and at the end of the show the one that he picks has the choice between a million dollars and this guy.  So, the idea is, is he worth a million dollars.
L:  Oh, like, if you're really in love you'd take him versus, you know, if it's just for the money.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  
L:  I guess the thing really hard about it is even though it's reality it's not, I mean, it's -- it's not real.  I mean, there's real people in doing it but is that, you know, a real life situation?  I think that's the hard part for me to get into because I could date but that would not be the real outcome.
R:  True, and then there's shows like Real World where they just put seven or eight really attractive people in a house and just film their lives.  That's somewhat more real.
L:  Yeah, I guess, um, [LIPSMACK] well, I just heard on the radio [several inaudible words] -- is it Jessica, um, Simpson?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Ahah.
L:  A singer, and she just got married to another singer, I guess.
R:  I think his name's Nick O'Shea.
L:  Yeah.  And that they're gonna do the -- that sounded kinda interesting, [MN] um --
R:  What are they gonna do?
L:  They're -- they're taping, um, newlyweds.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, so they -- they're being taped since they got married and -- 'cause they've never lived together --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- before they got married.  So, how it is, like for her to -- for them to move in together, ah, pick stuff, you know, like, this is my space, this is your space and --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- um, I don't know, she was on the radio and talking a little bit about, you know, like, she doesn't put the toilet paper on and he's, like, a neat freak. [MN] Kinda, those kind of adjustments so that's gonna be -- they're taping.
R:  I like the reality TV comedies where they make fun of people who are just going about their daily lives, like, [several inaudible words].
L:  Like, for example?
R:  Like, um, there's a show I like where, I think it's called Trigger Happy TV, where they go outside a, ah, a grocery store and they have probably nine or ten people in on a gag and they're out there with, like, um, a camera crew and, like, a -- a man, you know, like, a full band, like a trumpet and a trombone and -- and a woman wearing, like a beauty queen sash --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a guy in a tuxedo with a microphone in his hand and they stop somebody who's on their way into the grocery store and say, "Hey, congratulations, you've won the, you know, you're our fifty thousandth customer", and they hold out a big banner that says fifty thousandth customer [COUGH] and throw confetti [COUGH] in the air and they say, [MN] "Your big prize is, you get to go into the store for two minutes and keep anything that you can grab except for alcohol within two minutes, then rush back outside", and the band's playing and, ah, they count down.  [MN] They go, "Okay, go", and they have a big timer and the guy runs into the store and the store is full.  It's, like in the middle of the day.  The guy's elbowing people out of the way and pushing people over and knocking, you know, cartons in aisles everywhere so that he can possibly get everything in his cart as possible [MN] in two minutes, [MN] and then when he runs back outside after about a minute and forty five seconds --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's nobody there. [MN] And he's just run out of the store with two cartons -- with two shopping carts full of groceries --
L:  Oh, he --
R:  -- and he just looks around and there's nobody there.  He doesn't know what to do and he's just stolen a thousand dollars worth of groceries. [MN]
L:  Oh, man, [MN] and -- and then what happens?
R:  You don't know.  He just has a con- --
L:  You don't know?
R:  He just has a confused look.
L:  Oh.  I was thinking when you started talking that that was, like, um, Murray on Candid Camera but then there's nobody there.  Ooh.
R:  Same kinda stuff though.  I like the Candid Camera shows.
L:  No, yeah, I like that and then they were -- and then, you know, when it was that era you were kinda looking for, "Oh is this you or am I on Candid Camera?", kind of stuff sometimes.
R:  So, um, reality TV.  What other reality TV shows are coming out?
L:  [MN] Well, um, I don't know.  Are they doing another Survivor?
R:  Probably.  Did you -- well, did you watch the first one?  I didn't see the first one.  
L:  The first one I did.
R:  What's it -- like, what's it like?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, it was teams and they were, um, [LIPSMACK] on the island and then they gave them, like, stunts every night, like, in competition, one team against the other team and then whoever won the, which team won, um, [MN] like, then one of the other team members had to pick somebody to go off their team.
R:  Hm.
L:  And then that's kind of like how they got to the ...
R:  How'd they pick?
L:  They picked base on -- based on [MN] what kind of personality, politics.  Like, the first one, the guy who won, I don't -- it seemed really odd that -- I think I got to the last one, maybe I don't even know who really won but it, you know, it was, like, okay, did you work hard, you know, did you -- everybody think you were working or do we think you were a loafer. [MN] So, if I thought you were a loafer we kind of voted you off 'cause it's, like, I'm working harder than you or if you piss me off ... and [MN] -- and then, um, [LIPSMACK] then it got to be kind of the women against the men and, you know, power plays and, like, who's the weaker one and let's collectively get together and vote the other people out so it kinda got into [MN] power dynamics and [MN] kind of all that thing and then, um --
R:  So, who'd they pick?
L:  [MN] Well, it was, like, there was this army sergeant who, I thought he was, um, a seal who I thought was a -- really a jerk, but [MN] I know he got to be down to the last two and I can't remember if he won or who the other person won but, I mean, it was, like, I'm thinking, "He's gotta get picked off", but maybe his talents or stuff that we really didn't see, you know, he really got everybody together to be surviving but the clip that they showed on TV was really, I don't know, I didn't like him but ... [LIPSMACK] and that's other pieces[?] like how much do you, you know, do they hype that you see on the show that [inaudible] to how much, you know, they're taping and stuff?
R:  You think they -- you think they alter the show, like, what really happened, like editing or something?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I wonder.  I mean, that's what I wonder, if -- if maybe initially it's reality but then by the end it's, you know, acting.
R:  Huh.  Would you act to be on the show?  How would you wanna be portrayed in that type of show?  Would you wanna win?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I think if I went to that level of [MN] -- expose myself, I'd wanna be going for it.
R:  Hm.  Which show would you wanna do?
L:  [MN] Um ... I don't -- I don't know that much about the current ones.  Certainly not Fear Factor.  That -- I could put my son in that one though.  [LAUGH] If he was old enough.  He's, like, "I'll do anything".  [LAUGH]
R:  What's the grossest thing you've ever seen on that show?
L:  Oh, um, [MN] oh, there are so many.  Mostly the eating stuff that's l- -- alive.
R:  Ugh!
L:  I mean the eating ten buzzing bees or something, or, I mean, that would pretty much gross --
