R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Monique and I'm a mother of two young kids and, uh, I love reality show.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, my name is Douglas and I'm single and have no kids and I watch whatever I can find on T.V., but the reality show does beat 'em all.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you watch them?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  [LAUGH] I try to catch, uh, every one of 'em I can.  Unfortunately right now with two young kids I can't see too many of 'em, but I've seen the M.T.V. one.
L:  That's my favorite, M.T.V.
R:  Really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, the one that's named Howard I guess.  He talks with his little cam, "Oh, I can do this" and he cracks me up all the time.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know why reality T.V. shows really appeals to me but, um, maybe because of the real -- what we think is real dram- drama I guess.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it seems to be for real and they -- they don't like, um [LIPSMACK], make a scenario out of it trying to, you know, coach the people to do this or do that.  So, I don't know.  That's probably why it's appealing to me.
L:  Well, my appealing is that they're outspoken because I'm a very outspoken person.
R:  Ah.
L:  Mainly that little [inaudible] Lee.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She -- she tickles me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She tells it just like it is, but then the crazy way they get ya to laughing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it just -- she just -- I don't know -- somehow just picks your day up.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's just getting more and more nowadays the reality T.V.  It's almost like on every station now.  They come up with something and try to invent some new shows that have some reality to it, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even that -- like the American Idol, um, I think that's got something to do with reality too in a way, you know?  But, um ...
L:  Well, that American Idol, you know, they need to not be so harsh, you know --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh -- 
L:  -- give those young generations, you know ...?
R:  -- the fireman guy?
L:  Yeah, that fireman.  That's -- that's exactly it.  'Cause, you know, if he can do any better then he should get up and train those people himself.
R:  [LAUGH] But I'm like that's why it sells, you know?  People -- they may not like it ...
L:  He should get up there, you know?
R:  Yeah.  They may not like to hear the nasty remarks, but unfortunately ...
L:  But that's part of T.V. business, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  You got your come and your goes.
R:  Exactly.
L:  If you can deal with it then get up and do your thing.  If you can't deal with it then --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- don't get up there because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know you're gonna make an embarrassment of yourself --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and whoever's up there watching you.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  It's just like another Jerry Springer.  You take him for instance.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, ex- [LAUGH], yes.  Just like, uh, those, um, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire stuff, um ...
L:  Now, that show they shouldn't even have on T.V. because, you know, there's a lotta people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- who feel disappointed about that 'cause I'm in Southern Indiana --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you hear that type of thing going on all the time.  In fact, this town is more popular for stuff like that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  All you gotta do is step out your door and you see all kinds of this and that and everything.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, now that's dangerous.
L:  People getting married --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- two days later they're getting a divorce.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  That's sad.  That's -- that's, uh, you know ...
L:  Living like it used to be back in the fifties and sixties.
R:  Mhm.  It's definitely different these days, you know, and reality TV's just, uh, giving [LAUGH] a bad example more and more I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well ...
L:  Reality T.V. is really getting to be a joke nowadays.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  But, um, you know, you heard about those, uh, couples that, um, they got engaged on T.V. but then they really break up after the whole deal.
L:  See, that's what I'm talk- talking about, you know, stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's nice to have something like that because that really prepares the younger generation --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, uh, whoever wants to get married.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they should really write some things that they do on that, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- be more outgoing with it instead of so shy --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and when they're so shy about it then they should find another way --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to overcome it.
R:  Right.  And it's -- it's making like, um [LIPSMACK], commitment seem so cheap that way, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  That's exactly my point.
R:  I mean, it's so easy -- it's so easy to make commitments.
L:  Well, I just thought you take that email --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- those personals, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  They tell you that you [several inaudible words] when you go to expire they charge you for that.  That's just like buying sex.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  People shouldn't even have to worry about buying sex 'cause love is love no matter what --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and you shouldn't even have to pay for it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The only way you should pay for it is when you go to church and say, "I do.  Let's do it" --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and get it over with.  You shouldn't even have to worry about paying for it.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  I ...
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know.  I don't really see any, uh, good points -- I mean, good examples from reality T.V. these days.  Um, most what comes out of it will be like really not good examples for the kids these days.
L:  That's exactly my point.
R:  Uh, it's -- it is -- it is unfortunate, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, hopefully they will somehow come out with something that will be good for the new genera- ...
L:  More educational --
R:  Yes.  Something for the new --
L:  -- for both adults --
R:  -- generation.
L:  -- and the younger generation, you know?
R:  Yes.  Yes.  You know, something that builds up.
L:  They really need that.
R:  Yep.  Yep.  You know, the only one I can think -- well, I don't know if that's considered as reality T.V.  You know that show, um, The Worst Scenario?
L:  You know, I've heard of it, but I've never watched it or ...
R:  That one is just showing how you can survive in, uh -- when you're in the worst scenario.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  But I don't know.  Maybe that's -- that's considered as reality T.V.  But that's -- that one's pretty good.  I kinda like that one.  I don't remember what station that's on.
L:  Well, the Survivor show, uh, that one's a pretty good reality --
R:  Oh, yes.  Yes.
L:  -- you know, because it shows --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, a little bit of everything --
R:  But ...
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.  I've s- -- but I was watching the episode -- they try to emphasize on the -- on some of stuff too.  I don't know if you remember the very first one.  There is this one a guy who I guess just went naked [LAUGH], uh ...
L:  Yeah.  That was that gay guy.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  Richard.  Huh.
R:  -- and I guess in -- in the -- the most recent one they did the same thing with some of the girls.  Um, I wonder if that was Survivor.  I think that was Survivor.  There -- there were two girls I think they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they ...
L:  They were having a competition --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause they were trying to --
R:  Yeah, for -- for some food or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- get more points or something.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  On one reality show I think they need to take off and that's that Fear Factor where they have to eat all those stuff, you know?
R:  Oh, that one's horrible.  [LAUGH]
L:  Because, you know, here they've got all these -- that poisonous stuff going around like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- black cow meat and stuff like that --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.  That's some- --
L:  And that's just giving people ideas.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] that's something I don't want my kids to watch, you know?  I ...
L:  They eat, um -- the -- the stuff like that they shouldn't even allow it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's nice in some cases like --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- if you're going to school to become a nurse and stuff.
R:  Ab- absolutely.  [LAUGH]
L:  But other than that they need to leave it off the T.V. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and put something else.  I could see that they're scared to l- look at something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or jump off something but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they don't need that awful stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  They shouldn't even show it, uh, because, you know, that's really going too far.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it could be dangerous.
L:  It is.
R:  I don't know if you know that M.T.V. one, uh -- one show, that, um, stupid show and this guy does stupid, uh, stunts.  I can't remember the name of it.  Oh, Jackass.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  You know that one?  That one -- I think there are some, um, controversial issues on that one where people, um -- well, younger kids I guess they try to follow stupid acts and got into trouble.  I mean, they hurt themselves most of the time and, um, it just outraged the parents, you know?
L:  Well, just like that W.W.F. action -- wrestling stuff, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah, that's another one.
L:  They got a commercial now that they're showing where not to try these stunts at home.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, of course, these kids are doing it now.  They don't have to show that.  Just like how they do those stunts on skateboards, those new scooter thingies --
R:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
L:  -- you know, you see that going on.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, really T.V. -- people that make these commercials --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- these reality T.V. shows they need to take a good look out their door before they go to another town and do it.
R:  No.
L:  You know?
R:  But see all they have in their mind is money, what sells, you know?
L:  Money and hurting people.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Making a few bucks and putting [inaudible] where they shouldn't be.
R:  Unfortunately that's what the -- the extent they have to go to these days to attract, um -- to attract viewers, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  More and more people are attracted to, uh, these type of, uh, shows.  They -- they are just trying to -- to do what they think sells, you know, to make more and more money.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you're right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, you know, they do some of prisoner shows, you know?
R:  Prisoner shows?
L:  Uh, yeah, um --
R:  What is ...?
L:  -- I think it's on channel twenty eight on Sundays --
R:  Mm.  I'm not sure of that.
L:  -- and it shows -- well, it's based on Cops --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- the T.V. show Cops --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and they show a lotta stuff on there.  Stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- some of it's okay and some of it's not, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And when they show those prisoners in those cells that act crazy, you know, and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's got to be a gimmick to that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in order for them to put that stuff on T.V.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  One show I saw that was pretty good for kids, like mostly teenagers, they're showing boot camps for teenagers.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It really is 'cause Jenny Jones --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- Ricky Lake ...
R:  Oh, they did stuff like that.  You're right.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And that's good that they do because, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kids nowadays are something else, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Of course, I don't have none of my own, but I've raised six of my nephews and nieces and boy, a couple of the boys I tell you, I wished there was a boot camp for them.  I needed one.
R:  Uh, I -- I hope they'll do more shows like that that will show kids --
L:  That -- that'd be good.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the extent now for ...
L:  'Cause, you know, that even gives a reality check to parents nowadays, you know, that's having problems with themselves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the new mothers to be, you know, that gives them a reality check --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, and kinda prepare 'em.
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Well, what do you think of those, uh, reality date shows?  They have so many of those nowadays.
L:  Well, I like that Blind Date.
R:  Blind Date.  Now, that's a good one.  It's kinda funny, you know --
L:  That ...
R:  -- all those comments they make.
L:  They can keep Blind Date and the Fifth Wheel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But that Broken Heart one --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they need to --
