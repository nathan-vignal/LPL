R:  Pam Freda McIlroy.
L:  Hi, my name is Adam.  How are you?
R:  All right.  How are ya doing?
L:  Oh, fine thanks.  I'm well today.
R:  I've not done one of these before.  So, I don't really know what to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  I participated in my first one yesterday.
R:  Okay.
L:  Uh, I guess we're just supposed to go over the, uh -- the -- the choices they gave us.  Habits and what's worse.  Remember the choices they gave us?
R:  Uh, smoking, not exercising, gossiping, um ...
L:  Yeah, um, a whole bunch of them.
R:  I can't remember the others.
L:  The one that stood out in my mind was the gossiping.  I don't know which one stood out most with you.  There was ...
R:  Um, gossiping and smoking.
L:  Gossiping and smoking.  Okay.  Uh, well, I guess I'll get started.  Uh, I would think the -- the one that's the worst would probably be gossiping because that involves other people not just yourself and, uh, if you say bad things about other people and therefore, um, you're -- they can't even defend themselves and if you want to do something bad to yourself it's one thing, but to do something bad to somebody it's something el- -- is -- is worse.
R:  Yeah.  And I've -- I've just recently have been in the middle of a bad gossiping situation and, um ...
L:  Oh.
R:  So, that one -- I guess that one is -- and smoking I still think would be a close second, but I guess gossiping ...
L:  Which one?
R:  Smoking.
L:  Right.  Well, smoking is bad.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, 'cause that ...
L:  I don't even -- when I see someone smoking I never even look.  The other day I was passing by and I saw someone smoking and I didn't even look and they called my name [LAUGH] and then I realized that was somebody who I know.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I just assumed that the people that I know don't smoke and, uh, then the person started talking to me and then I, of course, was chastising her for smoking and she said to me, uh, "Oh, I just bummed these off of people.  I don't smoke normally" and I've heard that from so many smokers and a few minutes later as we were talking her cell phone rang and she opened up her purse and she had a whole pack in there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, then a few days later she called to apologize and said -- and she said to me, "That's it.  No more smoking for me".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I said, "We'll see.  We'll see".
R:  Maybe it was that easy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I doubt that though.  But, uh, she goes outside and smokes.  She's -- she's just damaging herself and, uh, as I said the gossiping I think is -- is worse.  I -- I know people have said bad things about me over the years but, uh, it's always people who have been jealous or trying to put me down to promote themselves.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's usually -- I find that people don't gossip unless they feel that they themselves are better or wanna do something -- want to basically put you down to promote themselves.
R:  Was it a female who was doing the gossiping about you?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Oh, really?  'Cause being a female I know how bad we can be about gossiping and I -- I ...
L:  Uh, no, I've had guys gossip about me and it's okay, um, 'cause I realize that anybody who really knows me knows it's not true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, uh, that's -- if somebody wants to believe it they can go ahead and believe it but, uh, those aren't the people who really know me well and they can make things up and -- and I also always have to think of where the -- what -- what the source is.
R:  Right.
L:  So, uh [LIPSMACK], and then I just realize okay, so people can say bad things, gossip, whatever, but, uh, those -- but most people -- well, I would -- I would hope that the people who I know, uh, wouldn't believe, uh, whatever they hear.  They have to get everything from the source.
R:  That's the situation I was in, uh, uh -- out with a friend had said something -- made up something totally ridiculous that I had said about another friend and, um, the other friend immediately called me in front of her to ask her -- you know, she said she knew it wasn't true.  So, that kind of put that lady on the spot and she had to admit that she was gossiping and, um, that ended it there.  But I know how women can [LAUGH] -- I just -- I don't know too many men who gossip.  I know my husband and his friends they -- they may -- can get upset about things, they'll be mad about it for a little while, but then they're over it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and women just kind of add more to it.
L:  I guess I was in a situation recent- -- well, I guess within the last year I had -- well, it did involve three females and for some reason I got them all not to talk to each other [LAUGH] 'cause they were -- they actually had secrets from each other and I had no idea and I asked one of them -- I said to one of them I haven't seen you around lately.  I was just being nice and saying, "Hey, I haven't seen you around.  How are you doing?" and she got upset with the other one because she thought that, uh, I was told that she had moved in with some guy and so I said, "Well, I haven't seen you around the neighborhood recently" and I was just saying, "Hi.  How are ya doing?  I haven't seen you in a while".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  About nine months later it got all rectified.  They realized that I was just being innocent and they were all, uh, involved in this 'cause they didn't trust one another.  But, uh, yeah, I can -- I'm trying to think of [MN] -- I guess it's more of a female thing than a male thing.
R:  Yeah.  And it -- it starts early.  My -- my son just finished first grade and just the little girls who gossip in first grade is amazing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They start it at an early age.
L:  I'm not sure why people gossip.  I think 'cause they've got nothing better to do.  I -- I -- it just -- as I said earlier, it makes them feel superior to who they're gossiping about 'cause you wouldn't gossip about somebody you think highly of I would think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or you're not jealous of.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like, uh, if someone told you something about your husband, for example, you probably wouldn't believe it --
R:  No.
L:  -- 'cause they -- and they probably wouldn't tell you 'cause they know that.  So, uh, they're only gonna tell you something that there's the possibility you're going to believe and, uh -- and trying to make them feel, uh, superior of course.  But, uh, whatever.  Uh, they said the smoking thing.  Yeah, as long as people don't, uh, smoke in front of me [LAUGH] so that I have to, uh, get the secondhand smoke.  I don't mind.  Well, they're damaging themselves and, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's just amazing how -- how one little cigarette can totally stink up an entire room or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a large room or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have your windows down in your car and the person in front of you have their windows down you can smell it.
L:  Then you get it in ...
R:  It's ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It upsets me if I'm walking in the street and somebody is blowing smoke.  You can smell it but you know you can't do anything when you're walking in the street.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Or someone who stands in front of an entrance to a building and smokes.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  They have to have a --
R:  That's ...
L:  -- private smoking area.  You're not -- I'm from New York.  Where are you from?
R:  Georgia.
L:  Oh, I could tell you ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have a New York accent.
R:  [LAUGH] My southern accent.
L:  Yeah.  I see.  I see.  Uh [MN], it's still not ten minutes yet.  Uh ...
R:  What was the -- not exercising.  I -- I -- I'm kinda guilty of that, although I've -- I've started exercising.  It's -- it's hard to get up and make myself do it but, um ...
L:  I just make sure that I do it and then I can go on with my day.  I know I feel worse when I don't do it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and every time I take a -- a break from doing it it's tough to get started again.  Once I've gotten started then I can continue the flow.  I think the most difficult thing is the -- the stopping and the starting.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was sick last week so I didn't get to exercise and I've [LAUGH] -- I haven't exercised anymore this week.  I haven't made myself do it and ...
L:  And you're probably thinking well, I'll wait one more day, I'll wait another day --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- I'll wait another day.
R:  Yeah, I'll do it tonight and still it doesn't happen, something else comes up.
L:  Uh-huh.  I understand.  Yeah.  What were the other choices?  Do you remember any of the others?
R:  I can't remember.
L:  Neither can I.  Uh ...
R:  Those were the only three that really stood out.
L:  Hm?
R:  Those were the only three that really stood out.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], I can't remember.
L:  So, huh, we've gotta talk for ten minutes.  Oh, gosh!
R:  [LAUGH] And I'm not a big talker so ...
L:  Oh, I'm not either.  I'm not either.  I didn't realize this is the way it was gonna be.  At first I thought that someone calls and asks me questions.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I had no idea it's just a discussion you have to have with somebody, uh, and I think you only get -- they only call you three times.
R:  I think so.
L:  Oh, okay.  This is my second.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  One more to go and you pass it on to other people.  How long have we been on?
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  I don't have a watch on.
L:  Huh?
R:  I don't have a watch on.  Does something -- will someone come on and tell us it's been ten minutes or ...?
L:  Yeah.  They -- I -- I think -- what happened to me yesterday was a recording came on and said, uh, you have, uh, ten seconds left --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, uh, then that was it.  Yeah.  I don't know what time we got on.  We probably got on like eight, nine minutes ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think something will come on shortly.
R:  What else can we say about gossiping?
L:  What?
R:  What else can we say about gossiping?
L:  Uh, uh, let's see.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What could I say about gossiping.  Well, I -- a friend of mine, um, it was odd.  We were dating for about nine months and, uh [LIPSMACK], while we were dating a, uh -- then we realized it wasn't gonna work out.  So, we decided we were gonna break it off.  We still remained friends.  But this guy started bad mouthing me and, uh --
