R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Bill.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.  I'm Lester.  Who are you?
L:  I'm Bill.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.  We got talk about reality TV shows.  They're kind of boring.  I don't really like 'em all that much.
R:  I don't like all -- lot of 'em.  There's some of 'em I like.
L:  Which ones do you watch?
R:  Well, I watch [COUGH] that Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  I like that one.
L:  Oh, that was horrible.  How could you sit through that?
R:  Oh, i- -- some of the questions are very interesting.
L:  What do they do, like, I -- I think I've seen it like, maybe twice.
R:  [MN] Well, the questions, I like the questions aspect of it [MN] and when they start out real easy and then they get harder and harder.  I -- I like --
L:  Oh.
R:  I like that one.
L:  Wait a minute.  I don't think I'm familiar with that one.  That's the other one.  That's --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- that -- that was, like, a good show.
R:  [MN] Ah --
L:  That's on [LIPSMACK] -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  Which one is that?
R:  Who Wants to be a Millionaire is that one that's on -- used[?] -- used to be on, ah, in the evening.  Now it's on in the afternoons.
L:  Oh, yeah, that was good.  You know what they're talking about?  Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.  That was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- what was like --
R:  Oh, that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, ok -- well, that's --
L:  Yeah, that's what he likes.
R:  Oh, well I don't like this thing.  It was stupid.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's pretty crappy.
R:  Yeah, they are.
L:  That was, like, the worst show ever.
R:  [MN] I can't believe they put something like that on TV.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH] It's just horrible 'cause the other with the -- like, the sassy British lady with the weird accent, she was pretty cool.
R:  Well, I just -- I never care for any of 'em at all.  Even that one, this last one they had on there with that guy, ah, that wore a mask, Bachelor or something.
L:  Oh, that was horrible too.  That was horrible.  Yeah, the Bachelor was the last one.  I can't -- I can't stand the reality TV shows.  Who Wants to be a Millionaire was a good show though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was, like, great.  Like, I could -- I could get down with that one, 'cause I like the lady who hosted it with the British accent who was kinda rude.
R:  Ahah.  No --
L:  Yeah, she was cool.
R:  -- you're -- no, that's not, now Who -- she didn't do Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  She did, um, [MN] um, oh, what was the name of that?
L:  Which one did she do?
R:  Ah, mm ...
L:  Oh, you're right.  She didn't do Who Wants to be a Millionaire.  She did the other one with the three people.
R:  No, she had, they started out with, I think they started out with, like, six people.
L:  Six people.  Yeah, you're right.  They did start out with six and then it 
R:  I can't --
L:  -- moved down to three.
R:  I can't think the name of what that show was.
L:  It was called, um, I can't think of the name of it either.  I think I'm getting old.
R:  The th- -- now th- they got a man doing one too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Looks kind of like that guy, Chevy Chase or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or just like all the shows. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I don't really like reality TV.  I used to watch The Real World but not any more. 
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't really have time for TV.
R:  Well --
L:  But when I do watch TV I -- I don't watch reality shows.
R:  Well, I --
L:  Did you ever --
R:  -- don't either.  I wa- -- one thing I like to watch on TV right now is, ah, ah, the outdoor shows.
L:  Oh, what are the outdoor shows?  Like, fishing?
R:  Outdoor Channel, like, ah, they do fishing, they have, ah, hunting, [MN] they have, ah, gold prospecting.
L:  What is gold prospecting?
R:  Prospecting for gold.
L:  Who does that?  I mean, people really, like, prospect for gold?
R:  Yeah, I do that.
L:  [MN] You do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  That sounds kind of, like, hard.
R:  Nah, it's not hard.
L:  Do you ever find any?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Gold
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gold gold.  Where?  Like, the mountains?
R:  Oh, we got -- here in Georgia now there's several places n Georgia you can find gold.
L:  Are you in Georgia?
R:  Ahah.
L:  Wow, Georgia's so far away.
R:  Where're you at?
L:  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Yeah, but I'm from Miami.
R:  Oh, from Miami?
L:  Yeah, but that's closer to Georgia.
R:  Yeah, it's real close.
L:  Yeah.  But Georgia's --
R:  I used to -- I used to live down in Fort Lauderdale.
L:  Oh, Fort Lauderdale's so nice.  I -- I lived in Fort -- well, I lived, like, in between, like, Miami and Fort Lauderdale so I'm, like, literally, maybe fifteen minutes away from Fort Lauderdale.
R:  Hollywood?
L:  Like, I'm down -- yeah.  I'm, like, right in Hollywood.
R:  I've lived in Hollywood too.  Off of Griffin Road.
L:  Oh, okay, okay.  Hollywood is nice.  It's, like, chill.  Florida's weird though.  Georgia's weirder.  How do you like Georgia?
R:  I love Georgia.
L:  You do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Ah, like, what part of Georgia are you in?  Like, Atlanta?
R:  I'm in the northeastern part of Georgia.
L:  Oh, you're, like, up in northeast section.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Wow, that's kind of, like, not very much going on in northeast section of Georgia.
R:  Well, there is -- there's quite a bit.
L:  There is?
R:  I mean, it depends on what you want.
L:  I guess that's true.
R:  We don't have no variety shows up here.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I guess that would be true.  That would be true.  That would be true.
R:  But, ah, we -- ah, see, I'm, like, I'm probably about an hour and a half from North Carolina.  I'm about an hour -- an hour from South Carolina --
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  -- and I'm about an hour and a half from Tennessee.
L:  Wow.  See, you are, like, in the heart of the south right now.
R:  Basically, yeah.
L:  That's cool.  That's all right.  The south is interesting.
R:  But, ah, yeah, I -- I like the Outdoor Channel.  I like, ah, fishing shows, hunting shows.  I like, now, I don't -- variety shows, like I said, ah, that, um, [MN] that one we were talking about, I can't think of the name of it --
L:  The ... yeah.
R:  Then they've got another one on where, ah, they have these teens and then at the end of it they have, ah, [MN] where they, ah, are gonna be t- -- ah, a friend or foe.
L:  Oh, what is that called though?
R:  I don't know the name of that one either.
L:  They're gonna have a new one like that about [MN] -- about a, um, surfboard or something where there's a bunch of people go and live in a surfing house or some
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- junk.  Yeah, it's -- it's gonna be weird.  But, like, they, all of a sudden they -- they just, like, keep making up new ones.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, every day I feel like there's a new reality TV show.
R:  [MN] Well, some of the movies they're making now are sick.
L:  [LAUGH] That's true.  That's true.
R:  [MN] I can't get over all the animation they're doing any more. 
L:  Well, there was -- th- they -- and have you seen, um, there was one, like, 'cause I hate animation, I think it's kinda boring, but I saw one that was really good, Shrek.  Have you seen Shrek?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Did you like it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  See, that was good.
R:  Shrek had a good -- there was -- there was a story there.
L:  Yeah, it was a good story.  It was a really good story.
R:  And there was -- it had a meaning at the end of it.
L:  Yeah, it was -- it was deep.  I enjoyed Shrek.
R:  And --
L:  The lady became the ugly woman and was killed.  
R:  Ahah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I liked it.  I liked it.  I haven't seen Finding Nemo though.  My friend wants to see it.
R:  Which one?
L:  [LIPSMACK] This one, it's a new, like, the new, like, Shrekesque type -- 
R:  Oh, I --
L:  -- movie.  It's called Finding Nemo.
R:  Oh.
L:  With the fish.
R:  My grandson'll probably get into that one.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, you got a grandkid.  That's cool.
R:  I got fourteen of 'em.
L:  Oh, my God.  How did you get fourteen?
R:  With my daughters and my sons.
L:  Oh, man.  My parents have two kids.  I have a hard time trying to believe -- I have hard time seeing them with fourteen grandchildren.
R:  [MN] Oh, I love it.  I also mentor school at two different schools for kids.
L:  Oh, what do you teach?
R:  Ah, well, I -- whatever they wa- -- whatever they want to talk about.
L:  Oh, so you just, like, talk to them and stuff?
R:  Right.
L:  I see that with people who work at the school -- at the school that I go to, which is kind of cool.  It's nice.
R:  Well, they -- they need somebody to talk to once in a while.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  We do, like, this poetry thing with the people here, which is cool.  It's cool.  Some of the poetry was a little interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Other poetry was kinda good.  
R:  [MN]
L:  A little was bad but it was fun.
R:  Some of their lives are -- see, I do elementary schools.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- ah --
L:  You like younger kids?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  'Cause they're, you know, there's -- there's two types of people you can't fool.  You can't fool old people and you can't fool young kids.
L:  [LAUGH] That's a good quote.  H- how come young kids you can't fool?
R:  [MN] 'Cause th- they'll -- they can read you like a book.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  I mean, I guess they have to learn social graces yet so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they have no reason to try to be nice.
R:  Exactly right.
L:  Yeah.  Th- -- I g- --
R:  And they'll tell you exactly how it is too.
L:  Yeah, even if you don't wanna hear.
R:  Yeah.  And they'll tell you what's over the top of their head --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- where other people will lie to you, you know.
L:  Yeah, I know what you mean.  I know what you mean.  Are -- are -- are all the people that you mentor younger?
R:  Yeah, yeah.  I do, ah, second grade and, ah, fifth grade.
L:  Oh, I wanted to teach, like, third grade --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  -- which is kinda -- yeah I did.  I don't know if I still will though.  I think I might wanna teach high school now.
R:  Why?  What subject?
L:  Ah, probably, either history or English.
R:  That'd be interesting.
L:  Yeah, I -- I like history.  I think history is, like, [MN] the -- the most -- I think history is, like, the -- the [inaudible] -- the field that you can -- it's the most impressionable field as far as, like, teaching people history is like teaching them, like, how --
R:  Well --
L:  -- the world has been and how it could possibly be.
R:  Well, you know, when I was at high school I never cared for history.
L:  No?  Why not?
R:  Ah, it's too boring, the way it was taught to me, I think.
L:  You can't say that.  History is fascinating.
R:  I thought it was boring.
L:  No!
R:  But now after --
L:  Did you like English?
R:  -- after I got older now, after I got out of high school and everything [MN] and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I love history now.
L:  Okay, that's cool.  That's cool.
R:  [MN] History's very [MN] -- to me, it -- it repeats itself over --
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  -- and over and over again.
L:  It does.  And that's why I think it's an important thing to teach kids.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I really do.  The -- English is also, like, my other subject that I think is really cool.  I don't know which one I'll end up teaching if I do even end up teaching.
R:  Well, English seems hard to me.
L:  English is -- is -- it's -- it's, like, it's a very, like, personal subject, I guess.  You know what I mean?
R:  Ahah.
L:  'Cause you're always talking about what you think something means and how it relates to something you think about.
R:  Right.
L:  Which is kinda cool.  I mean ...
R:  Well, it's important though because of communication.
L:  [MN] Yeah.  That's a very central part of English.
R:  But then writing too.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And I think, like, essentially when you deal with kids, like, you --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- you really wanna try to get those, um, skills --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- develop.  Mm.  Writing and reading --
