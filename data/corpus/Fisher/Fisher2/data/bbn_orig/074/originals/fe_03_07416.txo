R:  Hi, my name is Brandon.
L:  Hi, my name is Mary Cam from Chicago -- or outside of Chicago in Illinois.
R:  Okay.  I'm in Minne-, uh, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's not too far.
R:  No, not at all.
L:  Okay.  Well, I -- I guess as far as the personal habits of the ones they listed probably to me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoking.
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I was going to say alcoholism.  But smoking really.
L:  I was hoping that you weren't gonna say you smoked.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That was gonna make this difficult.  Yeah.  I have, um -- I have -- let's see -- in my own family I have one individual who smokes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's definitely -- and in my in laws I have another one and it's just yuck.
R:  Right.  Right.  It not only affects that person, but it affects the household and all the people that's in it as well, you know?
L:  Exactly.  And then as for my health, um, we don't let anyone in whose -- I mean, we don't allow smoke in our home.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, I -- I think we've even had somebody decline to come to our, um, holiday function --
R:  Really?
L:  -- on the basis of the fact that we just won't let 'em in to smoke.
R:  [LAUGH] Wow!  They really take it seriously then, huh?
L:  Um, well, you know, I figure if they can't respect your wishes in your home then they don't need to be there.
R:  Yes, I agree.  I definitely agree.  And plus another one of the bad personal habits I was -- I was gonna say overweight, but really that's -- that's something that affects really that person, that individual though, you know?
L:  You know, it is, it's, um -- it's one of those things where -- I'm about maybe forty pounds overweight, but I'm -- I'm active.  So, to look at me you wouldn't say, "Oh, you know, there goes a grotesquely fat person".  Like if ya ever watch, um, Jerry Springer or stuff like that --
R:  Yes, I do.
L:  -- you see those big, huge people --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's what really strikes me 'cause I think to myself oh, my God, what -- what would you do if you were four hundred pounds --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and you couldn't move and ...?  I mean, it's unfortunate, but then I guess we're just -- I don't know -- not trained, but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's such in our world today that when you see somebody like that the first thing you do is look and say, "Oh, look".
R:  Yep.
L:  You know?  And -- and I don't know that it's right, but it just automatically grabs your attention.
R:  Yes, it does.  You're right.  And it's -- it's the first thing -- I mean, appearance is like basically the first thing that hits us when we see another person, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  How they look, you know?  And sometimes that can be very prejudicial, how you form an opinion of that person.  [COUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And -- and it's unfortunate that person because you may not give them -- like, if you're looking for somebody to date you may not give 'em a second glance when in reality they're, you know, a pretty decent person and probably somebody maybe you may've wanted to go out with.
R:  Definitely.  Definitely.  And the inside could be, you know, a very decent person, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- with very -- very -- you know, rooted and grounded morals.  But then you look at 'em and you're like well ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, and then I -- you know, another -- I guess the sad thing about the overweight though is unfortunately those people that are largely overweight, um, and I guess we consider 'em obese, some of 'em -- I mean, to me obese is like huge, but like I guess according to the medical definition you don't have to be huge, you just have to be quite overweight.  But anyway --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- on -- on T.V., you know, when -- especially I think it's, um, Morrie -- I don't know what his last name is -- that Morrie guy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, you see these kids that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I've briefly watched a few of the shows 'cause it just breaks my heart to see 'em, but these little one year olds are like --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that.
L:  -- seventy pounds or more.
R:  Yes.  Yes.  The overweight kids.  Yeah.
L:  Exactly.  And -- and if you look -- I would guess that probably ninety percent of the parents that are on that show with those children --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you look at them they're overweight.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, how can you tell your child that he can't eat and those habits when you yourself are doing it?
R:  Right.  You're exactly right.
L:  I mean, I just decided finally that I've gotta take weight off.  So, I'm -- you know, it's one of those things where you try to curb some of your bad habits and really once you get used to it it's not bad.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I can't say that I've curbed them all obviously.  But, um, you know, it's things you don't realize, like with kids, you know, you give 'em snacks, I mean, you start really looking at the -- at those labels and stuff on these things.
R:  The nutritional value of the thing.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Exactly.  And, I mean, these poor kids some of -- I've seen some kids weigh as much as a hundred and twenty five pounds and they can barely walk.
R:  Yep.
L:  And the -- the one lady I remember she said she tried chaining her refrigerator shut --
R:  Really?
L:  -- it got so bad with her little one and, I mean, you know, that's a hard way to start off a person's life is -- is -- that way.
R:  Especially today.  I mean, these kids are like you said four, five, six, seven years old and it's like wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're already at a disadvantage because --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- the genes in -- in that kid's body is -- is already blown out of proportion because of the -- the +overweightness, you know?
L:   Mhm.  And unfortunately for those kids in school when they're that little, you know, with just starting school the other kids of course are gonna make fun of 'em --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, that -- that makes it tough to just start.  I mean ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But ...
R:  That brings the whole self esteem issue into play now.
L:  Exactly.  But unfortunately their parents, you know, they don't understand and I -- I understand that a few of these kids now -- I think I've seen just a few on there that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there is a -- an actual physical medical problem.
R:  Right.
L:  But by and large most of those kids just eat too much.
R:  Mhm.  Right.  And their parents are feeding 'em all these calorie driven type snacks and stuff and lack of exercise plays a part in it too.
L:  Exactly.  And, I mean, it's hard with kids.  I mean, we've got a little one who's gonna be two at -- at the end of the month and fortunately for him --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's [LAUGH] -- he's been twenty six pounds I think forever it seems like.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, when he was born in fact he went for like oh, almost -- I think the first check, you know, the first couple of days you go back you're supposed to have gained X. amount of weight and they were concerned about his weight gain and would possibly have put him back in the hospital.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, by the end of two weeks he picked up and he gained weight on the normal scale.  So, I mean, he's on the low end of the scale.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  This little one he can eat and he runs it off and does whatever but, um, you know -- and to look at my husband and I weren't not fat, I mean, obese or anything, but we're -- we're both overweight --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and my husband's losing weight on account of his heart problem and, um, you know, it's one of those things where when I -- when I watch what we're feeding him.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, we're also fussy eaters.  So, it's hard to try and balance, you know, teaching your child to eat healthy things when you don't like them yourself.  So, it makes you start to look at your own habits.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I try to explain that to my wife as well, you know, about her eating habits and how she eats and how it affects our kids, you know?
L:  Especially with that heart thing, you know, we both decided -- like my husband was a Coke nut --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I drunk -- I would drink a lot of pop, not that I craved it or I had to have it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but it's there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I finally stopped bringing it into the house, you know, and it's amazing, you -- you get rid of three cans of pop a day and that's over four hundred calories.
R:  [NOISE] Yes, indeed.
L:  And it's hard for our little one because, you know, we give him Sprite --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or [inaudible].  I at least give him something that's not caffeine, but for them, you know, at that age it's tough because if you 'em juice it's got too much sugar.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you give 'em pop it's got caffeine.
R:  Yep.
L:  You know?  And he doesn't really care for water.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's just one of those kids that -- and they tell ya when you're nursing not to give 'em a lotta water 'cause it's in the milk and so as a result he didn't want milk, uh -- water.
R:  Water.  Right.
L:  He loves to see water, but he doesn't wanna drink it at all.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's one of those things that, you know, you're constantly struggling to -- to watch, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, we try to feed him things like brown crackers that are low in -- you know, in calories --
R:  In calories.
L:  -- and in fat content and that.  But it's -- it's not easy.
R:  No, it isn't.  It's definitely ...
L:  And if you ever go to McDonalds and eat one of their meals my God, um --
R:  Phew!
L:  -- you can eat like a thousand calories in no time at all.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And -- and before you know it, you know, you're overweight.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Well -- and, you know, there's that guy that in New York tried to -- and he was unsuccessful -- but he tried to sue McDonalds because he was gaining weight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause they didn't tell people that their [LAUGH] -- their food could make you get fat and I'm thinking now this is a no brainer --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- they give ya nutritional facts.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  If you don't read it that's your own fault.
R:  Exactly.  It's not their fault.
L:  [LAUGH] And then they give you now the super size meals.  So, of course, you can get even more calories put on to that meal.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But -- but in our day and age I think, you know -- I don't know -- people just don't worry about that anymore and I see some of these people that I think oh, no, if you're not careful, you know --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- it's gonna get ya.
R:  Exactly right.  And before you know it it'll just be a pattern in your family down the road, you know, in -- in your heritage of just overweight people.
L:  Exactly.  And, you know, it's kinda funny 'cause, you know, we talked about smoking and overweight, well, we're -- I used to be a -- a very active bowler and my husband bowls a lot --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and what is the first thing that happens when you go to a -- a bowling alley?  They whip out their cigarettes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they have three bottles of beer.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, now you've got both habits going on there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And oh, my God, when you walk out of there you reek to high heaven --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's nothing -- it's -- you know, you can tell it's really bad when you get in your car and it's been so smoky that you can smell the smoke in your car --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- just from your jacket and then when you come home you have to like put your jacket outside --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so that it doesn't smell out the house.
R:  And it's in your hair as well, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  [MN]
L:  It just -- it permeates everything and it doesn't go away quickly.  Well, my in laws, um -- my father in law smokes and his car reeks I guess of -- of smoke --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and all ya have to do is go over there and oh, my God, I just can't take it.  So, I don't go over there.
R:  Now, did you know that nonsmoke-, um -- vehicles that have smoke in it, it -- it decreases the value of the car?
L:  No, I didn't.
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  But I can imagine that it would.
R:  It does.  Because a lotta ...
L:  Now, you mean like on the resale value or --
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  -- trade in, you mean?
R:  On the -- on the resale and trade in as well.
L:  Oh.
R:  If you have a smoking vehicle versus a nonsmoking vehicle that smoking vehicle's value decreases and it -- it decreases the value of the car.
L:  I'll be damned.  Well, you know, it makes sense --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- 'cause would you wanna buy somebody's car that -- that somebody's smoked in?
R:  Of course not.  I'm a nonsmoker --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so I'd like -- oh, you know, I wouldn't want my vehicle to be -- be smoke filled.
