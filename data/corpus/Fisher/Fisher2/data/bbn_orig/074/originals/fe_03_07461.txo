L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, my name is Alexis.
R:  Hi, my name is Zara.
L:  What was that?
R:  Zara.  [SIGH]
L:  Zella?
R:  Zara.  Z.A.R.A.
L:  Zara?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, that's an interesting name.
R:  Thank you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  This is the first time I've ever done this.  So, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Same here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  So, do you watch reality show TV?
R:  I do, actually, quite a b- [LAUGH] bit.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, do you.
L:  No, I ... don't h- have TV.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you don't.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  No, I don't even -- I -- I have a TV and I -- [SIGH] my girls and I watch movies and stuff [SIGH] but [LIPSMACK] I got rid of, ah, TV --
R:  O- o- o- oh!
L:  -- about a year and a half ago.
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  Yeah, I couldn't afford it and also --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- because I thought TV sucked.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well I'll tell you those -- even the reality shows are getting a little out there --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- any [LAUGH] way.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  They seem so trashy, --
R:  [SIGH]  They do.
L:  -- you know, even more than they used to.  I'll admit that I, [SIGH] um, used to watch a little bit of the very first S- Survivor [SIGH] before --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- ah, I watched the very last episode of it and [SIGH] and I thought it was kind of cool but t- then, [SIGH] you know, the whole thing -- but Fox seems to be the ruler of that --
R:  Oh, I know, yeah.
L:  -- don't they?
R:  Oh, they are.  They are big time.
L:  They come up --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- with some of the sleaziest stuff and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just thought, you know, commercials are bad enough.  Um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] I have two impressionable young children.
R:  That's true.  That's true.  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know.  Why do you think they're so popular?  [SIGH]
R:  Probably because figure, "Well, let's see what -- how other people want to live their lives" personally.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I think that p- probably has something to do with it and I think there's this dark twist -- you know, it's the same kind of thing, like, with [SIGH] ah, rubber necking when you go --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, --
L:  -- past an accident.
R:  -- exactly.
L:  -- [SIGH] people have this dark fascination --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- with the morbid and [SIGH] -- and with seeing [SIGH] exactly --
R:  Trying to see --
L:  -- um --
R:  -- exactly how oth- -- you know, see into people's lives.
L:  Exactly.
R:  How --
L:  And they want to see the dark and the smarmy.
R:  Right.
L:  They want to see the -- the dirty and the nasty [SIGH] --
R:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I think it makes other people [SIGH] feel better about themselves.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  You know, "Oh, look, my problems [LAUGH] aren't --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- near so bad --"
R:  [LAUGH]  That's [LAUGH] right.
L:  "-- as so and so".  [SIGH]  And --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- then there's I think probably the dream stuff too, like, Who Wants to be a Millionaire?  Where it's, [SIGH] like, you get this g- great shot.  This great opportunity and ... anybody can know a bunch of useless facts.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  So, it makes anybody ... possible to win the big jackpot.
R:  Well, see, I think that -- what the p- program was -- Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?
L:  O- o- o- oh!
R:  Was -- y- yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  That one was just --
L:  That was trashy.
R:  -- oh, that one was just awful.  [SIGH]  I --
L:  I don't understand how they could actually a- ah -- oh --
R:  I know it.  [LAUGH]
L:  I would n- never volunteer for a [LAUGH] show like that!
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think --
R:  [SIGH]  And that's -- and Fox has come up with these -- since then it's been with Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?  [SIGH]  What was the other one?  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, they just got through with it.  [LIPSMACK]  It was, ah -- [LIPSMACK] the -- where the women thought ... he was a millionaire.  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, Joe Millionaire.  That's what it was.
L:  O- o- o- oh --
R:  And the women --
L:  -- he was just a common guy.
R:  Y- yes.  And he ended up just being, Joe nobody, pretty much.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  And they didn't find out till he'd picked someone to marry.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  He had to tell them he didn't have a million dollars.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, what about the new one that's hosted by Monica Lewinsky where all of the guys are blindfolded and they're battling for this woman.  And --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's supposed to make it so much, [SIGH] you know, the values and morals aren't as skewed because [SIGH] she's not judging based on looks.
R:  Right.  Well see that one just --
L:  She's judging based on personality.  [SIGH]
R:  -- that one I really w- watch, you know, that one -- in -- in fact that one just got over with.  The new one they have out now is, [SIGH] For Love or Money?  [MN]  And all these women are battling for this guy, of course, [SIGH] and they don't realize at the end of it they have to pick whether they want to be with him [SIGH] or a million --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dollars.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Oh, you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- know, what is wrong with our country?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Why do these -- this is -- oh, see, this is what I think is so seriously skewed about our values and morals in this country.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They -- p- people put -- it always comes down to love ... or money.
R:  That's right.  Exactly.
L:  And it's, like, why -- why does it have to be one or the other?  Why can't it be both?  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Ju- --
L:  And what is this teaching our children?
R:  Oh, I know it!  We're trying to teach 'em one thing and if you turn on the television they want to completely teach 'em something different, you know?
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  T- that one I'm not watching so much.  I like the ones like, I guess, [SIGH] on the MTV ones, the Real World and --
L:  O- o- o- oh!
R:  -- I like the -- the Osbournes.  They just crack me up, people like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  I've never seen that show.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've heard all about it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  And I -- I remember watching a -- a commercial for some s- soft drink or something and it had Ozzie Osbourne on it and I --
R:  Y- yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- can remember looking at my boyfriend and saying, [SIGH] "Does he really talk like that?"
R:  Yeah, and he does.  [LAUGH]
L:  And he's, like, "Oh, yeah --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- yeah".  And I'm like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "I can't understand a damn thing he's saying!"  [LAUGH]
R:  They really need to have subtitles on the bottom [LAUGH] of it, actually.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [COUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, oh, man!
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I think you can't believe him.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That was just weird.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, w- where do you live?
R:  North Carolina.
L:  North Carolina?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I live in Oregon.
R:  Oh, do you, really?
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  I've got my -- I've got some family that lives out there.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I was just out in Raleigh t- two years ago.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, you're kidding!
L:  Yep.  I was there --
R:  Oh, man!
L:  -- for the State Fair and everything.
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Are they -- do -- do you think they're more popular back that way?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, I don't know.  I [SIGH] -- the way people are around here, of course, living in the Bible belt as we d- do [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- y- you know.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  People, you know, ah, it's [SIGH] -- see I'm originally from California.
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  So, we moved here about fifteen years ago so I still -- I don't know --
L:  You h- have picked up a bit of an accent.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You see the people here [SIGH] [MN] they say, "You're not from here are you?"  I say, "No, I'm not".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They go, "I can tell.  You know, you don't speak --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- like we do".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  No, I think out here we have [SIGH] -- w- well, you know -- you know, it's -- it's Oregon.  We're very liberal --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- and very openminded and can't seem to make a damn d- decision about anything.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I know --
L:  So, it's like, --
R:  -- you know.  [SIGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] oh, I don't know.  --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I hear people talking about how th- they watch the shows, a- and then I hear some people say that [SIGH] they really can't stand them.  But I -- I think I've found that t- the majority of people say that they don't like 'em.  [SIGH]
R:  Well see, --
L:  But I --
R:  -- ah, the thing is this, t- they may say they don't like 'em but I think a lot of people s- say that but they still --
L:  Ex- --
R:  -- watch 'em.
L:  -- exactly --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think it's a love hate relationship.
R:  [SIGH]  Yep.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  They -- they w- -- it -- it's like, um, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's like I said, like, when you're rubbernecking at a -- a -- a --you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at an accident and you're, like, [SIGH] you go by really slow --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- hoping you don't see blood and guts --
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but thinking you might and --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- so you look, you know.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's, like, [SIGH] or when you're watching a horror movie and you've got your hands over your eyes --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but you're peeking between your fingers.
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  You know, like [SIGH] "I don't want to see anything, but I -- I -- but I want to see" --
R:  Yeah, it's like --
L:  --y- you know?
R:  -- one of the things, you don't want to admit that you do it but you do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Exactly, it's this --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- dark, twisted thing and [SIGH] I think that's n- natural.  Humans [SIGH] -- I mean we've -- I -- I think we've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- always had that.  I mean l- look at, [SIGH] you know, in the past [SIGH] a- at, ah, public executions [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't think it was just because [SIGH] it was a good way to deter [SIGH] because otherwise, [SIGH] ah, that would have kept it from happening again, [LAUGH] you know, --
R:  That's right.  [MN]
L:  -- but it continued to happen.
R:  That's right.
L:  They continued to have public executions because it wasn't enough of a deterrent.
R:  That's right.  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  People kept showing up because it was, like, entertainment.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  It was something to w- watch.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  People like to watch pain and suffering and [SIGH] I don't understand it.  It's very macabre, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, ah, there's something about the human personality that seems to get a thrill out of it.  I don't know, maybe it makes us fee more alive.  [SIGH]
R:  I guess.  I don't know, it's just [LIPSMACK] -- it's too weird.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's, like, I don't even try to.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I sit there and I watch my TV that I watch and that's about [LAUGH] it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I'm not one of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these ones that will sit there and say, "Oh, no, I would never watch that".  [NOISE]
L:  Well, I remember there was one that came out that I felt really sorry for where the guys [SIGH] -- the guys got tricked to coming to this ... show.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  They thought it was something big [SIGH] and i- it was there girlfriends [SIGH] telling them, "You need to ... m- marry me".  They -- they showed up in a wedding gown.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, that, y- yes.
L:  And the guys came on to the stage --
R:  Y- yes.
L:  -- and they said, "I'm here to ask you to marry me and if you don't marry me now we're through".
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  And I'm thinking, --
R:  -- know, yeah.
L:  -- "Man, you --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- just dragged this guy out on to the stage [LAUGH] --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- and in front of thousands of people [SIGH] and on national television --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- [SIGH] you are so ..." -- I mean, talk about pressure.
R:  Well, see I think a lot of it started with all the -- you know, talk -- with all the ... g- g- gossip talk shows that they have with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Ricky Lake and Sally Jessy and --
L:  That's true, Jerry Springer.
R:  -- exac- -- oh, gosh, I know.  [SIGH]  At least --
L:  All the exhibitionism --.
R:  -- a lot of them are --
L:  -- and stuff.
R:  -- yep, at least a lot of 'em have changed their format.  Jerry Springer, he's still just the bottom of the [LAUGH] h- heap.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  That's one thing I --
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I hadn't thought of that 'cause you didn't really see many of these reality TV shows until the talk show kind of started to take a downturn.  [SIGH]
R:  Yep, exactly.
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- y- yeah, that's true.  I -- I think you're probably right.  It created quite a little segue [SIGH] into these.  [SIGH]  And Survivor was the really big one.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  D- do they still do Survivor?
R:  Y- yes, they've got --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- another one s- starting.  [SIGH]  I --
L:  And I was -- oh, Su- Survivor and then there was Paradise Island.
R:  Yes, and they've got ano- --
L:  That was the second one.
R:  -- they've got another Paradise Island type thing starting where [SIGH] the more you watch, you can actually -- i- if --
L:  [SIGH]  I heard --
R:  -- somebody doesn't hook --
L:  -- about that.
R:  -- up with somebody else [SIGH] then you -- the viewer can try to get on to the Island.  [NOISE]
L:  That's right.
R:  Oh, my --
L:  You can -- i- it -- it's like [SIGH] they start out on the island with a certain amount of people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and then [SIGH] th- -- each week they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take somebody off and they +plonk -- plonk a viewer in.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  And I thought, "Well, how's somebody supposed to win that if they keep adding new contestants?"  [LAUGH]
R:  See I don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- see to me I don't think that one though --
L:  How does that work?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't think that's a money one.  I think that's one where they wanted to see people hooking up with each other [MN] is really what I think that --
