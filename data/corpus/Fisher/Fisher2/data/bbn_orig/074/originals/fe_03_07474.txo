L:  Hi, my name is Priscilla.
R:  [SIGH]  M- my name is Betty.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, hello, Betty.
R:  U- um, [SIGH] they sure gave us a hard topic didn't they?
L:  Y- yeah a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- pretty hard topic.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, actually I kind of -- I have my opinions about that whole, u- um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- inspection --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- arms inspections of Iraq.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I don't think that it's a top priority.  [SIGH]  Um, ... yeah, I never thought it was a top priority and then [SIGH] even more so with the conclusion of the war, we still have -- really have not found any [SIGH] weapons of mass destruction [SIGH] which we initially went there for, to encounter --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so [SIGH] I don't know.  I don't really -- I never thought it was a top priority.  I think that there are i- internal issues that we needed to have dealt with.  I don't think that Iraq was an immediate threat at the time.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  I don't think so either.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it seems like they're having more problems now since [SIGH] [LAUGH] -- you know, it's sup- -- [NOISE] the war's supposed to be ended but yet [SIGH] there -- they have t- these terrorists and --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- suicide bombers and --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- our poor guys --
L:  Ye- --
R:  -- are still over there and [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, it's unfortunate because now the -- we're over there [SIGH] and we're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what exactly are we doing?  You know, we're saying we're gonna rebuild Iraq but [NOISE] really, [SIGH] if you look at it we're actually just occupying the place until we can put a suitable government into [SIGH] -- into power and that's going to take a couple of years for that to occur.
R:  [NOISE]  I know.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.  So, ...
R:  I don't know [SIGH] I -- are -- are we wasting our -- our men and our money?
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  And we -- you know, we have our men and women over there and, you know, is it a cause that they believe in?  Probably not but they're in the military.  They're in the armed forces so they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have to be over there.
R:  That's it.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  And -- and then they say they're [NOISE] -- you know, first they said that [SIGH] a- ah, the Iraqis love the Americans but I -- I --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- see a lot of things that they don't lo- -- they say they hate the Americans.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Well that -- yo -- I -- I mean i- [SIGH] if you're over there serving in the military and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] the people, you know, welcome you and make you feel like you really are helping them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is one thing.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  But -- [SIGH] o- o- oh, [SIGH]  I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's a hard topic that we have.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Y- yep.
L:  [NOISE]  It's a very hard topic but ... I mean, we can't necessarily just pull out now [SIGH] because --
R:  No.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  But are they ever going to find these weapons of mass destruction?
L:  [MN]  I really don't think so because [SIGH] Iraq is about the size of California and we've been over there for ... months now and we would have found something if there was something to find.
R:  You would think so.
L:  Or people would have started talking, you know, like the people that were in their -- in their military and it --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- their -- their Iraqi soldiers, they would have started talking.  [SIGH]  People would have stepped forward because obviously [SIGH] Saddam is nowhere to be found, and he's not coming back to power.  [SIGH]  So, people would have started talking by now.
R:  [SIGH]  I wonder where he is?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I think he's in Iraq.  I -- I don't know.  I --
R:  Or Syria.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  He may be in Syria.  He's -- I don't think he's in Iraq, even though I was reading the news [SIGH] and they said something about the fact that he was spotted somewhere -- somewheres that the spotted him but I don't believe that.  [SIGH]  I think he's [SIGH] far, far, far off with -- because he took millions and millions of dollars.
R:  [SIGH]  Didn't he have -- I -- I mean they said they had to, ah, get, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] special equipment in there to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to ... get the money out.
L:  Wow!  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, o- o- oh, wouldn't it be nice to have so much money that you'd have to have [SIGH] a- ah, bulldozers --
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  O- o- oh, what would we --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- do with it all?  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [SIGH]  M- m- mm.
L:  Gosh it's a ... --
R:  [LIPSMACK]
L:  -- it's, ah, [SIGH] -- now it's like a no win situation because, you know, we're there and w- we can't n- necessarily pull out we have to stay [SIGH] and make sure that there's s- some sort of stabilized government --
R:  Y- yeah, --
L:  -- in that country before we leave.
R:  -- all that loose --
L:  Otherwise, you know, a- anti Americanism will ... just only increase because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's already on the rise.  You know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the rest of the world [SIGH] see us as ... a bully, basically.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  But --
L:  So, ...
R:  -- do you think that [SIGH] we -- it seems like we're always helping somebody.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Y- yeah.
R:  You know, and to me it s- seems sometimes [SIGH] like, we want everybody else to act and think the way we do.
L:  E- exactly.  Exactly.  [NOISE]
R:  And, you know, o- other countries [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they're happy the way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- well I can't see them being mistreated, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like the Iraqis were.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  But, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- i- if they're happy the way they're living, let them alone.
L:  Exactly.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.
R:  [SIGH]  'Cause I wouldn't want somebody coming in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and telling me, [SIGH] you know, "Oh, well, you should do it my way".  [SIGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  E- exactly, you're absolutely right.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't --
L:  [SIGH]  So, it's like where do draw the line?
R:  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And I -- I mean we have so much need in our own country.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  And we --
L:  Definitely.  You know, with the way our economy was at that time, you know, it's, ah, -- i- it's not a whole lot better now.  [SIGH]
R:  N- n- no.
L:  Yeah, the economy and [NOISE] [SIGH] ... I thought we were -- I thought Osama Bin Laden was our top priority but he's nowhere to be found.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  N- n- no.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  These guys.  O- oh!  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  He was definitely more of a threat than Saddam and, you know, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the focus has definitely swi- switched from him.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Y- yes [SIGH] and who --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- knows where he is?  Oh --
L:  [LAUGH]  No one knows where he is.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  -- o- oh, goofy.  [SIGH]  Where --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are you calling from?
L:  I'm in Michigan.  [NOISE]
R:  Michigan?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  O- oh, I'm in Ohio.  [SIGH]
L:  Ohio?  Oh, okay.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  That's not too far.  Ohio.
R:  Mm, m- my son in law ... c- comes from Michigan.  His parents live in Michigan.
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Oh, really?  About what part ... in Michigan?
R:  U- um, what's the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- name of the place?  Alpena?
L:  [NOISE]  Alpena?  O- oh, that's up north.  Yeah.
R:  Alpena.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, that's up north.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  That's interesting, um, [SIGH] if you kind of, like, look at your right hand, that's the way Michigan is shaped, [SIGH] and if you're l- looking at your right hand, your son is probably, like, midways up --
R:  O- oh!
L:  -- that's where his family would be from a- and I would be probably like in the front area.
R:  Oh, Uh-huh.
L:  Y- yeah.  So, I'm in the -- um, Detroit area.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  So, that's interesting.  [NOISE]  Yeah, where in Ohio are you?
R:  A- ah, close to Akron.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Akron, okay.
R:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]  It's --
L:  Okay.  So, the -- do you like it there?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  We o- -- we live o- out in a- a suburb.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We live on, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well it used to be a farm [SIGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but, um, we only have two and a half acres now.  [SIGH]
L:  O- o- oh.
R:  But I have a garden and, ah, --
L:  Nice.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] it's out, you know, it -- it's out -- like you feel like you're in the country but, yet it's real close to stores and everything.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I wouldn't like to live out on the boonies 'cause I came from Pennsylvania.  [SIGH]
L:  O- o- o- oh!
R:  And there we lived in the boonies.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Interesting.
R:  But, ah, [SIGH] -- I don't know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, would you go to Iraq now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if there was a -- a trip or something you could take?
L:  [NOISE]  N- n- n- no!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I would not go anywhere in the middle east.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me either!  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Nowhere --
R:  It's probably --
L:  -- in the middle east.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they'd figure out some way to shut me up.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  I would be too t- terrified.  [SIGH]  And, also, you know, just the -- [MN] I mean apart -- even if there were a stable government there, just the way they treat their women.
R:  [NOISE]  I k- k- know.
L:  You know, like second class citizens and you have to be all covered up when you're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- out and about.  [SIGH]
R:  A- ah, how do you suppose, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he made them --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- ah, such underdogs for so long?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Why wouldn't [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean c- could a man make --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, act the way they are expected to act?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  U- um, I think it's just a lot of intimidation, you know.  There's [SIGH] no one to go up against [NOISE] him.  The people that [NOISE] -- those few people that may have tried to go up against him, [SIGH] you know, are just automatically shut down.  Because you know the mentality when, [SIGH] [NOISE] um, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- we have people in the m- military and you have someone who supposedly is [NOISE] [SIGH] the superior, there's like this whole brainwashing effect where, "Okay, he's in charge so we have to follow i- instructions" [SIGH] and if the o- one person, or two people try to rise up against him, [SIGH] --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- they're immediately shut down.  Immediately shut down.
R:  [SIGH]  And then too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they've been told that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- f- from the time they were born.
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  Right, because he's been in power for a very, very, very, very, very long time ... you know.  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  He must have been a cruel r- ruler too?
L:  Very cruel.  [SIGH]  Very cruel.  [NOISE]
R:  I mean even to his own family --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] if they disagreed with him, a brother or a- any o- one.
L:  Yeah, it was, um, son in laws --
R:  Let's get rid of him.
L:  Yeah, 'cause his son --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- in laws he had [SIGH] -- I think one he had killed and another one --
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- h- had to flee the country.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Hey, question, how do we get paid for this?
R:  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  I don't really know.  You know, this is only the second one I've done.  Have you done --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- any others?
L:  This is, like, my t- third one and I never -- I think there's a web site that I'm supposed to check up but I've never been back to --
R:  Me too!
L:  -- look at it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Finished your research yet?  [LAUGH]  Because this will be, like, the third call.  [SIGH]
R:  Well t- the first couple of calls I got I couldn't understand the g- girl.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, really?
R:  [SIGH]  And all I could get was Fisher and I thought, [SIGH] "Fisher, Fisher Price?"  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That went through my head.
L:  [NOISE]  O- o- oh!
R:  [SIGH]  But, um, then I got on the web site again and a- and t- that reminded me.  Ye -- something came up about it [SIGH] and it reminded me and I p- printed the whole thing off but then I haven't had [SIGH] a chance to go over it and s- s- -- but they must keep track of it?
L:  [MN]  [SIGH]  Yeah, but no one -- they never -- no one s- sent me an email stating, "Hey, you've done three phone --"
