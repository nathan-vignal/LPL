L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Linda[?].
R:  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Whitehouse, Tennessee. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.  Well, I'm Nancy[?], I -- in, ah, Winchester, Tennessee.
L:  You are?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Oh, wow.
R:  How about that?
L:  Isn't that something?
R:  Yeah, because I've been getting --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- people from Florida and other pl- -- and, ah --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Chicago. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, this is my first one.
R:  Is it?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, it's my, um -- ah, third one.
L:  So, okay our topic is what's worse, smoking, alcohol, overeating and not exercising.  What do you think?
R:  And goss- -- was it gossiping?
L:  Oh, and gossiping, I forgot about that one.
R:  I think so.  Well, ah [LAUGH] I think smoking's really ...
L:  [MN] You know, I do too.
R:  I'm not a smoker.  Never have been and it's very offensive.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  And my husband smoked for maybe --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- all of his life -- ah, adult life, but he finally quit and when he did, he couldn't stand the smell of it, so. [LAUGH]  But --
L:  Oh.  How'd he quit?
R:  -- just -- he had to, he was getting -- having dizzy spells and the doctor told him to either quit or he was going to, ah, have a stroke or something.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, he just quit cold turkey.
L:  Well, my husband smokes --
R:  Still?
L:  -- but he goes outside.
R:  Well, that's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When my, ah, kin folks come they always go and sit on my, ah, deck.  They will --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not smoke in my house.
L:  Yeah, you know, and that's nice.
R:  And I don't let people smoke in my car.
L:  Well, you know, my grandad he had emphysema and heart failure --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- from cigarette smoking and he lived a long time, but he didn't have a real rich life.  He couldn't breathe.
R:  Well, I know.
L:  And it was awful.
R:  I think so too.
L:  And all of my uncles died the same way.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I don't really care for it at all. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I just never did.  I tried it in -- way in my younger years and I just -- you know, I didn't like it and it made me spit and splutter [LAUGH] and I just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- didn't take it up. [LAUGH]
L:  When my husband and I were dating I decided to smoke to show him how unattractive it was --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he knew that it would be killing me and I thought it would make him quit. [MN] After about two days of it, he just got used to that, so that didn't work at all.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know, that kind of backfired. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's something somebody has to make up their own mind to do, you can't do it for em.
L:  Well -- and he's tried that -- ah, the patches and the gum --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he's tried the gum, but it's just too expensive.
R:  Well, it -- i- that's another reason that I'm thoroughly against it, because it is such an expensive habit.
L:  I know!  And you know you could buy a whole lot more stuff with that than those cigarettes.
R:  Well, that's true.
L:  And -- and they just keep going up in price. [NOISE] 
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's outrageous [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well, you know what I told him, I said, "I'm not going to help you kill yourself --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so all you can have is four cartons a month and what you do [LAUGH] after that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's not my issue".  [NOISE] I said, "If you're going to do it, you're going to die slowly.  I don't want to get you gone off this planet".
R:  Well, it's the truth --
L:  And he --
R:  -- but -- it's -- my husband just laid em down and he, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he chewed gum and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he carried a pack in his pocket --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess for about a year afterwards.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But he never did touch em --
L:  Is that right?
R:  -- but he -- he had to have that security --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of having it on him.
L:  [NOISE] I don't think mine will ever quit --
R:  Well --
L:  -- he's just -- I think it's just -- he's addicted.
R:  Mm.  Well, it's a bad habit. [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, it is -- of course, you know, I don't like people drinking alcohol either if they're going to get in the car and drive around. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, gosh.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, I drink one but ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if I do, I'm never --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the wheel.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Wouldn't think of.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, no.  I like wine.
R:  But I do [inaudible] -- I do drink --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- occasional wine but ah excessive alcohol is sh- -- h- has ruined many a marriage and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's caused many a fatal accident.
L:  I would say so.  But you know, I like -- I like wine but I don't drink it often.
R:  I don't either but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, it's very good to relax [several inaudible words] --
L:  I got this chicken recipe I make with wine and my daughter likes that.  Of course, you know, the wine cooks out of it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but --
R:  But it gives it a flavor. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it sure does. [LAUGH] [NOISE] And she likes it --
R:  [LAUGH] Did you get on this through a -- a -- oh, the refunding site?
L:  I did.  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I'm a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's where I got on it.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I've got my email address on there because there's a lady coming from West Virginia to Hendersonville.
R:  Oh, I read that.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  Oh, now wait a minute.  You are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I've seen your -- oh, I've seen your post --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Tell me again your first name?
L:  Linda.
R:  Linda.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Linda from Tennessee.
L:  Yep, that's me.
R:  Well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- how about that?  Well, I'm Nancy, but I don't post on there too often, but I do if I really need something.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I needed that coupon, you know, for Bath And Body Works because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I had to get a present --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I wanted to get it and get something out of buying it, you know?  [inaudible] --
R:  Well, you live at Whitehouse, not Hendersonville.
L:  Yeah, I live in Whitehouse, but it's only fifteen --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- minutes from Hendersonville. [NOISE]
R:  Well, I have cousins in Hendersonville and --
L:  So, where's Win- Winchester located? [NOISE]
R:  Ah, it's, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nearly on the Alabama line.  It's just, um, about fifty miles from, ah, Huntsville, Alabama.
L:  So, you're near Waynesborough?
R:  Well, not really.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm over closer to Chattanooga.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.  Okay.
R:  I'm about, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fifty miles from Chattanooga.
L:  [NOISE] Is that right?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] My goodness --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  [several inaudible words] pretty good little distance from me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, ah, I grew up in Nashville, born and reared in Nashville but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I left there fifty some odd years ago --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  Didn't they have a big concert up your way last weekend?
R:  Oh, that -- Bonnaroo is going on right now, over at Manchester.
L:  [MN] You know, I know someone -- I'm -- I'm in, ah, training for this job I've got with two women from Manchester.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah, one of them's last name's Ingram[?] [MN] and the other lady, her last name's Chaney[?].
R:  Well, I don't know anybody over that way, but ah -- but Martha -- you know, Martha Bryan[?] that posts on there --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- on the [several inaudible words] --
L:  No, I don't know her.
R:  -- [several inaudible words].  Well, anyway she lives -- she lives over that way [several inaudible words] --
L:  Is that right?  Well, they said they put in a new exit for that area --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to keep people, you know, from -- but you know what they told me?  They said when they go into that concert, it's on private property --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- so the police can't c- --
R:  They can't [several inaudible words].
L:  And they said there's all kinds of drugs and --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- and alcohol.
R:  -- I saw that on the TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they say they can't do a thing about it.
L:  They can fly their helicopters overhead but that's all they can do.
R:  They said unless they, um, urinate in public or expose themselves, there's nothing they can do --
L:  There's just --
R:  -- and there again, is where your drugs are prevalent.
L:  Isn't that something?
R:  And the, ah -- it's a shame, but the police can't touch em on that private property, you're right.
L:  I just -- I just couldn't believe it.  And they said they had this big fountain up there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in front of some building and they didn't have enough rest rooms or hotels or bathrooms and stuff and people were getting in that fountain and bathing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- last year.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I've never heard of such in all my life.
R:  Well, I have -- they couldn't hire me to be over there. [LAUGH]
L:  No, I -- I wouldn't go near it with a ten foot pole.  I tell you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'll stay right here. [LAUGH] Now, Fanfare was bad enough last weekend --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with the Nashville traffic or -- you know?
R:  Well, I didn't even attempt that either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I stay pretty close to home, tend to my knitting. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I have to go into Nashville for this training, but after next week I'm through with Nashville --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- and I'll be glad, because that is just crazy.
R:  It's gotten too crazy for me.
L:  Well, they've got construction everywhere up there.
R:  Ah, you can't get anywhere.
L:  No, you just see it and you see it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, it's nice to look around at the surroundings, but there's nothing to see but machines.
R:  That's the truth.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have -- we have a niece that lives in Donaldson[?] and we go see her, but sometimes we never even leave Donaldson.  We don't even go into Nashville anymore.
L:  Oh, wow.  Well, it sure is growing faster than it should.
R:  Yes, it is. [NOISE]
L:  And you'd think with all that stuff and all that growth that they wouldn't need to raise our sales tax --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but they sure do.
R:  Mm.
L:  It's just out-- crazy.
R:  Well -- and now lottery is coming up, course that's not our subject tonight but [LAUGH] that's [several inaudible words] --
L:  No, but it is coming up, you know. [MN]
R:  Oh, that'd be a good subject for somebody, won't it?
L:  I think that'll be a great subject, particularly [LAUGH] if they get somebody in Tennessee who's for it or against it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because you know, that's been a real hot button.
R:  Well, what do you think about lack of exercise?  That's one of the other things?
L:  [MN] Well, I think I need to exercise --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- but I'm gonna tell you, on my list of priorities, that's not at the top of it.
R:  Well --
L:  Because I've got a child to tend to and a job to do and a house to clean.
R:  Well, I took it for years -- I took water aerobics here and in Texas where I came from there and, ah -- but the last year I've just gotten lax and I don't feel as good and I know I need to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I just don't do it.
L:  Well, I went to this seminar about the thyroid --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, it has to do with weight gain and not being able to lose weight and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- different things the thyroid does and he -- he has this new technique called Body Restoration and it's like acupuncture but it's called acupressure --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and he says that it'd help you lose weight and it clears out your system or something, but I researched it on the internet and I just don't think there's that much to it.
R:  Doesn't sound like anything.
L:  But I think they put you on all these organic foods --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they make you exercise.  Well, I can do that without paying [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- for acupressure. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I have -- ah, I have exercise video tapes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in fact, I, ah, did that in a retirement ho-
