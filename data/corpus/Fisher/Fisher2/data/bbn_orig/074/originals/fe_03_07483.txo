L:  [NOISE]  Hello?  [SIGH]
R:  Hello!
L:  Hi, my, --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- um, ...
R:  Ah, go a- ahead.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Hi, a- a- ah, let's s- s- s- see?
R:  This is Pam.  Who -- who is this?
L:  My name's Stephanie.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  A- a- ah, holidays, ah, I guess my favorite holiday is Christmas.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [MN] what's yours?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Christmas, not a big surprise.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  I -- I t- think it's almost most people's.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Uh-hum.
R:  Mm, but, [SIGH] I don't know, I guess why do like Christmases best?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  U- um, [SIGH] well it's exciting.  U- um, [SIGH] [MN] I guess f- for the way ... I think about it it's, sort of, a children's little gift holiday and it's [MN] fun to, you know, [LIPSMACK] surprise kids or ... p- pass on little traditional things [NOISE] and ... [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] stuff like that, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.
R:  Oh, I guess I like it because I -- I associate it with, um, you know, past Christmases and that's ... primarily when our f- family, the entire family, gets together --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- more or less --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- than most of the other holidays, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Uh-hum.
R:  So, I think that's probably 'cause of past m- memories, and whatever, that I -- it's probably my favorite because of that.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Now, I'm not real sure, they said to t- talk about, ah, creating a holiday and [LAUGH] how you would c- celebrate it --
L:  [SIGH]  I just --
R:  -- [SIGH] or a --
L:  -- sometimes think there's too many holidays.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that's --
L:  I lose track.
R:  I --
L:  I'm like, "What day is it the ...?"  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  I know some of 'em it seems like they're kind of s- stretching to find ... some th- -- s- some excuse for a day off or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  That's terrible.  Not that I don't like days off but I mean, [LAUGH] y- you know, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- sometimes it's kind of funny.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I don't know, I guess -- [SIGH] I don't know [NOISE] if I had to create one [MN] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I don't know.  I -- I -- I -- if I had --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to create one I'm not really sure --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I know my grandma always tells me about, um, [SIGH] I don't know about where you're at -- where are you at?  What state are you in?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I'm in Pennsylvania.
R:  I'm in [COUGH] -- I'm in North Dakota and, um, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- m- my grandma always talks about how they used to have [SIGH] names days, like, way back.  Have you ever heard of anything like that?
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Is that, like, e- everybody?  I don't know what that is.  I'd be taking a wild --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they had -- they had -- either like -- I don't know if it was -- I can't even remember it was -- if it was their, like, confirmation name; if it was a Catholic thing or if it was --
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [SIGH] middle name or something or other.  And [SIGH] on that day they always, [COUGH] you know, like you celebrate your birthday?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  They always -- they c- celebrated that and they had, like, people over for twenty four hours.  I don't know -- I mean, not that I'm that big into partying or anything --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- but I think it would have been kind of fun, [SIGH] you know, when things were, [SIGH] [COUGH] kind of, back, ah, in the older days where people actually v- visited one another [NOISE] and had company and that type of thing.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  I don't know, gu- -- I -- I guess if I had to create one it would be a holiday like that because I think everybody's so busy nowadays [SIGH] and doesn't really have time to visit or, at least, s- says they don't.  And -- I -- I think it's gotten a lot more impersonal and that kind of thing unless y- you're talking about your really close friends, you know?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  I don't know, I guess that's what I'd do but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah, that sounds like a -- a good idea.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I -- I, ah, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] I just don't know what o- other [LIPSMACK] -- I guess I'd like to see more, ah, I -- I mean I don't know if m- more holidays but b- better ways of celebrating, like, a- as you said, more [NOISE] [MN] [SIGH] -- really allowing ... time to, like, ... s- spend time with your friends.  And [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- not getting -- [SIGH] and, maybe, just eliminating a l- lot of the p- present ... buying.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Because I think that ... sometimes, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- like ... makes it more stressful than it [LAUGH] needs to be --
R:  Oh, yeah, and it kind of --
L:  -- 'cause it [NOISE] --
R:  -- over the m- meaning of everything.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  I don't think that Christmas -- I think pretty much everything anymore, everything's so commercialized.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  And when they start -- I couldn't believe --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] can't believe the last couple of years they've gotten really bad.  I think I started seeing Valentines Day, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [COUGH] stuff out, like, right after C- Christmas.
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Like, "God, give it a break", you know.
L:  -- yeah, they just -- y- yeah they gotta have --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- some kind of -- I don't know [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- unique to sell stuff but [SIGH] --
R:  You know, and by the time the holiday comes [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- it's almost like it doesn't mean anything because you've been ... i- inundated with it for, like, ah, two or three months already.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, you know.
L:  Ye- yeah, it doesn't -- it's not as s- special --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- because, --
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  -- you know, you're just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] [SIGH] it takes just way too much planning.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, yeah, exactly.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Plus, I mean, you just kind of get bored with it by the t- time [LAUGH] it's that day --
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's like, "Oh, yeah, whatever".  [SIGH]  I've had, [SIGH] you know, um, Valentine's candy for the past month now 'cause it's been available [LAUGH] and this that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the other thing, [LAUGH] y- you k- know?
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  I've already gained my five pounds, you know, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that really.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]  But, I don't know [MN] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and, [SIGH] yeah, I guess, I don't know I like -- I do like Christmas.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I guess because of the kids too.  I like watching my -- I don't have any kids of my own but I do like to watch my nieces and nephews and, whatever, and [SIGH] sometimes, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] [COUGH] like, my one brother is divorced so my niece doesn't spend every [NOISE] Christmas with us --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and it kinda seems like the less kids that are there [SIGH] the less ki- -- I don't know -- I shouldn't say this word -- the less morning it, sort of --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- has, ah, it just doesn't --
L:  [SIGH]  Well, yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- have the excitement, you know, 'cause you can't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- watch them.  They're the ones who get really excited [COUGH] ab- about it and it --
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  -- just loses something, you know.  [SIGH]  [COUGH]  But -- sorry, about my coughing --
L:  No, that's okay.
R:  -- that's allergies, so ...  [NOISE]
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  [COUGH]  O- o- oh, but, okay, Christmas what else can we say about Christmas?  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah, um, I don't -- [SIGH] yeah, I -- yeah, I d- do think Christmas [NOISE] is more fun when there's [NOISE] little kids around and it's not [SIGH] --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- just about --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- grown ups sitting around.  And -- and people are s- -- kind of so stressed out that [SIGH] sometimes I think that [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if there's not kids around in the hol- -- like, they're just like [SIGH] -- they just don't want to deal with anything.  They're just, like, s- so happy not to be at work that they [LAUGH] don't [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, I know, exactly.
L:  -- you know, they just want to watch TV or whatever.
R:  Or, a day off.  It doesn't really mean anything --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- more than that sometimes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  But --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- [COUGH] I mean, sometimes that's nice too.  But I know once in a while, [SIGH] [COUGH] although I like to be with my family, [SIGH] I have lived away from here and --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- there's been times where I thought it was really relaxing to kind of have a holiday to -- to myself [SIGH] and --
L:  [SIGH]  Y-- yeah.
R:  -- just, sort of, sit around and, you know, watch movies and do this and that.  Not --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I wouldn't want to do it all the time.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  But here or there when you are stressed out from work I think it is kind of nice.  And then I kind of think you appreciate [SIGH] maybe the next year, like, the next Christmas, or whatever, that much more, [NOISE] you know?
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  When you've got your --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- family around or whatever.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I mean --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- sometimes it's hard, yeah, [SIGH] but I think there's, also, like, a lot of [NOISE] -- at least in my family it seems like if you [SIGH] -- y- you have to spend it with a family m- member --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it was, um, [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] you k- know, if you --
R:  Yeah, there is -- I -- yeah, there is a pressure like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- yeah, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Although for a couple of years, like, with Thanksgiving [SIGH] I'd spent Thanksgiving with friends.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And, [SIGH] ah, you know, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I thought, "Oh, that would be nice" and then I was like -- I don't want to even -- I don't want to do that [LAUGH] a- anymore.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I'd rather, you know, spend it with family or just, --  yeah, have a r- relaxing day [SIGH] because w- with friends [MN] well some -- I think the weird part with the friends was I was t- the friend going, instead of like [SIGH] i- it wasn't like, [NOISE] oh, just a group of friends getting together for Thanksgiving --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it was [SIGH] me --
R:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
L:  -- going to another person's family [NOISE] --
R:  Right and it's awkward.
L:  -- and not knowing them -- and, you know, -- [SIGH] what is -- [SIGH] not knowing the food --
R:  [COUGH]  Mm.
L:  -- or just not [MN] k- knowing, you know, how comfortable to be with it, [LAUGH] you know?
R:  You know, and you kind of feel like -- I've done that before too --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] and, I mean, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- although I can usually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- f- fit in pretty well --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- it still seems like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] y- you -- you wonder more --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- i- if they, ah, -- you know, not that they weren't friendly or anything, --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- but you wonder if they really want outsiders there.  And it's just kind of a little bit com- -- uncomfortable, --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  -- in a way.  No matter how fun it is, you just still kind of feel like, "Well, should I be here or not?" [LAUGH] y- you know.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  Or just like what -- what's apr- -- what's the appropriate [NOISE] [SIGH] level of relaxation, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  E- exactly.
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  Do you kick your shoes off and put 'em under -- no, I can't.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  But --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] y- yeah, I -- I don't know.  A- as far as creating a holiday, that p- part is kind of hard for me.  Like I say, something that's more personal than most of the holidays nowadays --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I -- that's about a- all I can think of, you know?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, me too.  I agree.
R:  'Cause they settle -- or celebrate almost everything now, like -- like we think it's to the point of -- I don't want to use the word nauseating but, [LAUGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know, it just gets kind of -- I don't know --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- it's kind of -- everything kind of loses its special [COUGH] --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- significance --
L:  -- Yeah.
R:  -- or whatever.  [SIGH]  And I probably sound like [SIGH] the Grinch -- you know, that car- -- o- old cartoon?  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  N- no, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I think, yeah, it's --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it's [SIGH] ... it -- yeah, just --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- just having things be more low key o- or personal and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] I'm sort of glad that we don't -- like, in my family we don't have, like, [SIGH] a -- too much of a big production.  Like, every year we have to have this picture and every year everybody's got to put on their sweater.  And -- then th- -- or, you know, or t- things like that, that, um, [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, we don't --
L:  -- [MN] I don't know.
R:  -- do that either.
L:  Yeah, that's more like --
R:  No, I wouldn't like that either.
L:  No.
R:  Because that's too -- that's too programmed or --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- something for me.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't like to be that, [SIGH] -- you know, have to have a stringent, like you say, s- schedule --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- or something.  That -- that's not relaxing at all.  Then it d- does get to be more of a chore I think.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  But there are families -- I know I have a fr- -- a good friend who [SIGH] -- there it's just like -- I don't even know how to characterize it, -- like, not army but, I mean, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, w- what I mean -- i- it -- it's --
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just like everything down to the wire and [SIGH] like how can you e- enjoy this it's, s- sort of, [LAUGH] like [SIGH] you've got to be tired at the end of the day and glad that the holiday is over almost --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- yo- you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it's like [SIGH] -- and then it's -- s- some people say, "Well, you know, can we just not do that?"  And then this one person will just get really upset, or whatever, you [LAUGH] know, like --
R:  Exactly and then it ruins everything --
L:  -- [SIGH] mm.
R:  -- anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's just like, oh, --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's better not to --
R:  It is.  I'm sure.
L:  -- [SIGH] make a fuss.
R:  [SIGH]  It's funny though I -- I've spent Christmases in some other holidays at, --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- you know, when I've been away from --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- f- family and whatever -- other people's houses.  [SIGH]  It's -- it's amazing how after you get into, sort of, just your general routine of your, um, [SIGH] traditions --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- how int- -- it is interesting to spend some with -- with other people because theirs are s- so different.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  I mean before I did that I couldn't even imagine how different some of 'em could be and it was really [SIGH] s- strange even down to [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the f- food [COUGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- they typically eat.
