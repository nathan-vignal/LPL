R:  Hello?
L:  Hel- hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Sandy.
L:  Hello, Sandy.  My name is Howard Tan.
R:  Hi, Howard.
L:  Um, I guess we're supposed to be talking about reality T.V.
R:  I agree.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Do you watch any?
R:  Um, I admit to watching the first episodes of Survivor --
L:  Survivor?
R:  -- and I may in passing have seen bits of some of the current ones, but I don't like to watch them.  Have you watched any of them?
L:  [LAUGH] I tried.
R:  [LAUGH] What do you mean you tried?
L:  I've tried watching a little bit of Survivor.  I've tried watching The Mole.  I've tried watching some of these on Fear Factor.  Um, I -- I -- I must admit that a long time ago I've watched the M.T.V. Real Life.
R:  Okay.  I watched -- I did enjoy watching Real World at first.
L:  Real World.  Real World.  Yeah.  That -- that was a long time ago.  It was like one of the first reality shows.
R:  Mm.
L:  Um, but I usually stay away from the T.V. now.  It, um ...
R:  T.V. in general or reality T.V.?
L:  Reality T.V. and T.V. in general.  The -- the TV's just -- it just makes me depressed.  So, I don't watch T.V.  So ...
R:  Well, I -- I guess they want us to -- to discuss --
L:  Talk about ...
R:  -- why we think it's popular.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I think people are voyeurs.
L:  Are lawyers?
R:  Voyeurs.
L:  Oh, voyeurs.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that the -- and I think that the trashier the show and the more unrealistic [LAUGH] the situation people watch it more.
L:  Yeah.  Like ...
R:  Like Joe Millionaire is that ...?
L:  Like Joe Millionaire.  [LAUGH]
R:  That was the one where the fellow really was a construction worker --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I myself did not watch Joe Millionaire.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  However, I did watch a little bit of Regis and Cathy -- or not Cathy Lee -- Kelly -- Regis and Kelly and --
L:  You did?
R:  -- Kelly had to update her audience every week about Joe Millionaire.
L:  Whose Regis and Kelly?
R:  It's a -- it's a morning talk show --
L:  Morning show.
R:  -- on ABC --
L:  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Yeah.
R:  -- and because of my work schedule I don't -- I don't watch T.V. very much either, but if I'm having a cup of coffee I will flick on the news and then change the channels quickly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I found that amazing that here is a talk show, a -- a nationally syndicated talk show where the hostess has to talk about reality T.V. shows.
L:  Yeah.  It -- I think it's very big, um, I can't quite see ...  [MN] There must be some sort of appeal.  I think you're right about the voyeurism.  Um, there has to be something else, something that people are able -- oh, maybe people could understand these are real people, they are people just like you and I and they're put on to these shows and there's a chance that it could be them or it could be me on T.V. spending his fifteen minutes of fame, um, you know, with millions of people looking at it, um, with a chance of winning a million dollars.  It's like playing the lottery.  Hello?
R:  No, I'm listening to you.
L:  Um, it's like playing the lottery, um, you're -- you -- you have the lottery, um, there is twenty five million dollars to be won and by paying for one dollar you have this dream, a dream of actually winning.  The chance of winning is -- its -- I think there's a greater chance of getting hit by lightning twenty five times in one day.  But the chance of winning is just hope.  I think people hope to have some sort of excitement in their life maybe.  It's just a thought.
R:  Well, that sort of makes sense to me that the people at home viewing these programs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, maybe thinking well, what if that were me?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or what they would do in that situation.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But I -- I wonder about the people who put themselves in the positions to be on these shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I don't know if I can express what I'm thinking.  Um, they all seem -- you know, you see the previews of the shows in commercials and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- especially these shows where you have all these women.  What is it?  The Bachelor?
L:  The Bachelor.  [LAUGH]
R:  Is that where all the women are trying to ...?
L:  Bachelorette.  Yeah.  And the Bachelorette.
R:  Well, these people seem to be fairly attrac- -- very attractive, very intelligent people.  They all have -- if what they say these people are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the business sense it's true.  They're bankers [LAUGH] and lawyers and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, physical therapists.  Why do you need to do this?
L:  Uh, I -- I -- I -- there was another reality T.V. show.  Um, which one was it?  Like -- it's like on Discovery Channel about people who have to go travel around the world with a partner and --
R:  Oh, and follow clues.
L:  -- and follow clues.  Now that is something I would enjoy.  I mean, I -- I didn't -- I haven't watched it.  It's like the Great Experience or Great Trial.  I really don't know the name.  But the chance of actually traveling around the world and figuring out clues and trying to solve problems on the flight now that -- that would be really exciting stuff.
R:  But you're using your brain for that.
L:  Yeah.  You're using your brain, but it is reality T.V.
R:  True.
L:  I mean, these people are trying to figure out ways of -- it's like that Mole series that was out a while ago and was popular, people trying to ...
R:  Yeah.  I'm not familiar with that one.
L:  Well, I think the -- the concept there was you have a team of -- I don't know -- ten people and they -- they have a -- a series of, um, tasks that the teams to accomplish, but there is one person on the team that was trying to sabotage everybody, but they were trying to be so that they can't [LIPSMACK] -- so they weren't found out about, like the only guy was there to sabotage.  Um, that was -- there's a lot of back stabbing and that's why I didn't like ...
R:  Manipulation.
L:  Manipulation, back stabbing.  I really don't like things like that where -- where people are being mean to each other and then they're playing mind games back and forth.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [MN], but why do people like reality T.V. shows?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I guess there's a couple of categories of reality T.V. shows.  There's these mind game ones with like, um, your Survivor shows, your Mole shows, your -- and then there's like really reality T.V. shows like, you know, um, Real Life, whatev- -- Real World that's on the T.V.
R:  Well, I -- I think out of all the ones that I've ever seen --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think the -- it's not the current Real World ones and it's not the original Real World's.  There was one where they actually gave them a bus- -- they had to create a business or work together.
L:  Yeah, I remember that one, that the ...
R:  I think those were good because not only did you see into the aspects of however many members were in the household, their backgrounds and their upbringings, but they also had to pool their resources together as people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to keep the business running --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think that's why I -- I -- I guess you could say I was hooked.  I remember I -- I sat one Saturday and watched a couple of episodes.  There must've been a marathon going --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it did hold my attention.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but it was more the business aspect of it and I think they were doing a T.V. show for maybe like a ...
L:  Yeah.  I -- I remember that one too.
R:  That's the one that I -- that I saw and -- and it was mainly the business part of the episodes that I enjoyed watching.
L:  Yeah.  They were given a certain amount of budget and a certain amount of time.
R:  Yeah.  And, you know, they were young.  I think they were all college students or -- or just starting out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in their careers and -- and I found that part intriguing to watch --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- of how they were all taking what they were good at and -- and trying to work together as a team.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But when it came down to [NOISE] their private life or things that they -- they needed to do on a day -- I -- I had no interest in that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I -- I -- I almost found it offensive.  Just like I really find The Bachelor and The Bachelorette very offensive --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just as a person [LAUGH], um, to be ...
L:  It's your personality.
R:  Yeah.  To be vying for A. a million dollars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- based on whether you'll pick this person or -- or they'll pick you.  I -- I just find it inappropriate to me.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I agree.  That's why I don't watch it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but I agree with what you're saying about how you enjoy the business -- business -- that's why I also enjoy like these discovery -- like travel the world and go from point A. to point B. and try to get there as fast as you can with, uh -- see, they're given just a certain amount of money as to ...
R:  I think I may have seen that one.  I remember that they had a -- a man and a woman were a team and they had run out of money and ...
L:  Run out of money and they were pretty much stuck and had to really work the situation and I -- I enjoy positive thinking.  I enjoy people who are always trying to work for a common goal.
