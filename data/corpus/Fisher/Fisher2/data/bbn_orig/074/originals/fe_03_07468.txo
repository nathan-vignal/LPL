L:  Hi!  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Hello, my name is Lynda Jacobs.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, my name is Mindy.  [SIGH]
R:  Hello, Mindy.  [NOISE]
L:  H- hi, how are you?  [SIGH]
R:  I'm good, pretty good.  I've got a cold.  [MN]
L:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  So, what are we supposed to do?  [MN]
L:  Oh, I think we're supposed to talk about the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- Iraq situation.  A- ah --
R:  And those, well --  [MN]
L:  And whether or not --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- what we feel the United States should -- should do.
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  And I -- I guess --
R:  [MN]  Since they've got us so deeply involved [SIGH] I think they should go and do what they need to do to get it over with.  [MN]
L:  That's what I think.  I think since we're already over there [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, they need to go ahead and take care of it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and because they didn't do it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- last time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and --
R:  [MN]  And they really haven't fi- finished it this time either.
L:  No, but they -- they want to -- to act like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to us that they have --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I don't think --
R:  It's not finished because --
L:  -- [SIGH] I think they've --
R:  -- they're getting --
L:  -- got a long way to go.
R:  -- killed there every day.
L:  As well as when people are --
R:  Getting killed.  [MN]
L:  -- dying every day over there --
R:  Uh-hum.  [MN]
L:  -- there -- it's not over with and [SIGH] -- and I think until they know if they've got Hussein for sure or not, you know, t- t- they -- it's -- they -- they've got to find out about him, one way or --
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  -- another they've got to either find him --
R:  They've got to complete it.
L:  -- or --
R:  They've got to do what they need to do to get it --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- finished with.  [NOISE]
L:  They do.  Too many people have lost their lives for them to ... put it off and then twelve years later --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- us be down -- d- down the road again and, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ah, more people having to be sent over there [SIGH] and go through it again.  I think they just need to, ah, bite the bullet and just go on and get it over with and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I just, ah, --
R:  Me too, and maybe the people will be, [SIGH] ah, more friendlier to the United States.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  It seems like the people over there really don't care about ... the United States.  [NOISE]
L:  They don't like us.  I mean they don't.  I mean even after everything we've -- you know, h- how we've helped them and everything.  [SIGH]  They don't like us but, you know, there's very few ... c- countries that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- really like the [LAUGH] United States.  They all consider --
R:  There's not.  What it is they feel that we try to take over [SIGH] --
L:  They think we're bullies.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but Hussein's at fault.  They feel like the United States is trying to take [SIGH] their oil and be over them.  That's what they think.  [SIGH]  So, the United States has to prove -- [SIGH] has to make them ... know that we're not after their oil and we don't want to be the boss of them.  [MN]
L:  Right.  That we're just trying to help them [SIGH] to have a little bit of what we've got --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- as far as freedom --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and -- and, you know, things like that.  [SIGH]  It's -- I -- I think it's -- I think it's sad to see those kids over there carrying guns.  And, you know, [NOISE] [SIGH] I have a fifteen year old daughter and I -- i- it -- it would break my heart to have seen her when she was seven, eight years old walking around --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] with a gun.
R:  Even then at fifteen you wouldn't want her [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  Even now --
R:  -- to have a gun.  [MN]
L:  -- no.  Even now [SIGH] but, you know, you see some of those little kids with their big eyes and -- and you know they're afraid.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  But --
R:  [MN]  But, you know, they take, a --
L:  And they're hungry.
R:  -- a volatile[?] and just leave it in the house.  [SIGH]  I'm going to a wedding and I get this phone call.  [MN]
L:  Ah, this one?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]  That's the way it usually happens, isn't it.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm -- I'm concerned that my, ah, cell phone [SIGH] when I get to a certain spot [SIGH] it may stop picking up.
L:  O- [LAUGH] oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  Hopefully it won't.  [MN]
L:  Hopefully it won't.
R:  [MN]
L:  The last -- I've done one of these b- before and the last one pas- -- seemed like it passed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pretty fast.  So, ...  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  I think I did get one.  I'm not so sure [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I hear somebody calling ... yesterday at home but I'm not sure if it's from this or not.  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, this is the only one like this that I've --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- participated in so I know that this is the only one I've -- that I've done [SIGH] but, um, I -- I don't know.  What was your subject on your other one?
R:  Oh, let's see what they told -- Asbestos.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, [LAUGH] gosh, [LAUGH] at least mine was food which is something I know a lot about.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, that's why --
L:  Too much about.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know.  This could have been just somebody calling because somebody call [SIGH] and they just wanted to know something and I just hung up.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I say I get tired of trying to talk to people about some things that I don't know about anyway.
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  I know.  I know.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And I -- I -- I'm not a real [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, seriously political person either, so this one was kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, but I -- I know how I feel about things.
R:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
L:  I had a lot friends that --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- were in the Gulf war --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- in the early nineties --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [MN] and, um --
R:  Yeah, a lot of people have lost their life [SIGH] so ... to keep them -- their lives from being -- is they -- they need to go and do -- complete that job.
L:  R- right.
R:  We need to look at it as a job and get it done.
L:  [SIGH]  Well, we don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- want our kids to have to deal with --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- this twelve years from now.
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  You know, having t- to deal with --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- sending, you know, s- some of their family members over there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, [SIGH] [NOISE] y- you know, ah, it's just -- I -- I think it's [NOISE] just -- I don't know --
R:  It's sad.  I -- I do think.  [MN]
L:  It is sad.  It is and it -- it's sad for the people that are there, but [SIGH] it -- it makes me angry though to see those people in -- in those countries, and other countries, burning our flags.  And -- you know, ah, --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- [MN] and people here --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it makes me angry here to see --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to have seen people burning, ah, -- the American flag.  [SIGH]  And I'm like, you know, "You -- you're living in this country that's giving you the freedom to burn that flag and you should be ... proud of it [SIGH] instead of --"
R:  You know, whether we got it good --
L:  "-- standing there in the middle of the street burning it".
R:  -- you know, most people in the United States [SIGH] has a lot.  Got cars and [SIGH] night --
L:  Right.
R:  -- long television and stuff like that.  [SIGH]  A lot of it -- places don't have this.  [MN]
L:  And -- and they've got the freedom to voice their opinions where --
R:  That's right [MN] --
L:  -- you know, --
R:  -- [SIGH] they can say most --
L:  -- Saddam Hussein would shoot people who didn't believe the things.
R:  -- most things.  [MN]  Some things you can't say, you've got to be careful.
L:  [SIGH]  And Hussein would shoot people who didn't believe the things that he wanted 'em to believe, you know, and -- and here you don't get shot for that, I mean, not normally -- not by our government anyway.  [LAUGH]  You might get shot by a road rage person or something but not the government.  [SIGH]  You know, the government's not going to shoot you --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for your opinion, but, you know, it -- it's just, [SIGH] I don't understand that.  That part, y- you know, kind of reminded me of the Vietnam ... situation where people [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I -- I mean I was --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- just a kind then but I -- I remember things on TV and, you know, o- over the years have talked to people who came from there and [SIGH] how -- how much the protest hurt them, you know, because --
R:  Yes.  [MN]
L:  -- it wasn't their choice --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to be over there and it's not these people's choice to be over there.  [SIGH]  But when --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- they join the military --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- they made the choice --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- to go if they needed --
R:  Look [SIGH] --
L:  -- to go.
R:  Yes, but then most of the people were being drafted, that's the difference.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  That is the difference --
R:  Now --
L:  -- it was definitely --
R:  -- ah, they -- you know, we're --
L:  -- against their will.
R:  -- not being drafted.  [SIGH]  Then they had to go.  [MN]
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]  Most of the people that went was kids and they were drafted.  [MN]
L:  Right.  A- and -- and that was -- ah, they came back and people were spitting on 'em and [SIGH] cussing 'em and everything else for -- f- for having gone and -- and it wasn't even their choice to be there.  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]  That's right.
L:  And that's what I --
R:  And a lot of them didn't come back.  [MN]
L:  No.  [SIGH]  And that's what makes me angry about even now --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, after knowing that our country's gone through that one time before.
R:  [SIGH]  But, ah, I don't think even the soldiers sh- should have been [SIGH] look -- looked at there because they didn't do anything but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- try to defence ... the country.  [MN]
L:  I agree and that -- that's what makes me so mad when I see these people +lying down in the streets [SIGH] here in our country, +lying down in the streets --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- protesting.  [SIGH]  You know, I -- I -- I agree, I -- I -- you know, when --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it first started I was like, "Well, you know, it should have been taken care of twelve years ago when his daddy was in there".
R:  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  You know, his daddy should have --
R:  That's right [MN] --
L:  -- took care of it just like he said he was.  "We're not leaving till Sa- Saddam Hussein is dead" [SIGH] or gone or whatever [SIGH] and then he didn't follow through with it --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and we wouldn't be going --
R:  But the thing is --
L:  -- through that now.
R:  -- I don't think they know --
L:  No.  And I --
R:  -- whether he's dead or what.  [NOISE]
L:  No.  [SIGH]  Just like old Bin Laden, you know, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] --
R:  Now, what happened to him?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]  They can't find him either!
R:  The furthest I have been --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he is and then we're finished with, ah, Hussein. [MN]
L:  Yeah, they need to get 'em both and get it over with --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and [SIGH] -- and, hopefully, they will [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it just, ah, --
R:  Now, what they talking about is what happened to their mass weapons of destruction?  [MN]
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  They haven't found --
R:  They never found them.  Where --
L:  -- those yet.
R:  -- are they?  [MN]
L:  But I -- I do believe he has them somewhere.  I don't know where he has them.  I believe [SIGH] that he does -- ah, now -- not there to the extent that America's -- you know, that Bush thinks that they have, or whatever, but I do [SIGH] believe that there's something over there.
R:  Mm.
L:  Because too many of them were walking around with gas masks and stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so they were expecting it.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, I -- I believe --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there's something over there but [NOISE] [SIGH] you know, --
R:  [MN]  But where -- where is it --
L:  Ah --
R:  -- or what it is?
L:  I don't know.
R:  So, I figure more of 'em -- that, ah, stuff like anthrax than anything.  [MN]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, that's what I think.  I think it's going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- chemical and biological.  The things that are [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, the things that are plaguing us now.  We don't know what kind --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of -- like, this West Nile --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and all this stuff --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- could have been planted.  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know that's right and where I work I been bit about ten times ... this weekend.
L:  Ah, what the -- w- what [NOISE] --
R:  By the mosquitos.
L:  Oh!  And I hate that.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  I hate g- going outside and worrying about ... i- if you get bit, you know, --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [SIGH] you got to [SIGH] [NOISE] worry about if you start getting a little sick if that's what caused you to get sick, you know.
R:  Y- yeah, I know.  [NOISE]
L:  And y- you're sick right [LAUGH] now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but, ah, I'm sick because I got a cold --
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, ah, [MN] I know -- where I live they have found a virus [SIGH] in a bird already.
L:  Oh, they have?
R:  But I --
