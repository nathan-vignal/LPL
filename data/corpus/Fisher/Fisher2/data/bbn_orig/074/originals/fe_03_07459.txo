L:  Hi.  My name is Stephanie.
R:  Yeah, hi, I'm Bill.
L:  [MN] Hi.
R:  So, did you get the agenda there, what, why those TVs are so popular now.
L:  Yeah, um, [MN] I think it's just because people like, um, watching people who are, I guess, some- somewhat normal and, ah, you know, the, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- who don't necessarily fit the, like, the American dream or whatever.  What do you think?
R:  Well, I more or less -- I watched Survivor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- more so.  Ah, that was more reality in a sense and it kind of shows, ah, ah, what, the stress on people and -- and how they can survive --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if they need to.  Ah, as far as the, ah, ah, Millionaire thing there I -- I didn't get into that really. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I didn't either.  Um, I don't really watch reality TV shows very much but [LIPSMACK] I know a lot of people who do.  So, did you, um -- did you get really into Survivor or just kind of watched it?
R:  [MN] Yeah, I kinda, ah, well, [MN], yeah, I did get into it.  I watched, you know, ah, it was more like, [MN] ah, to see how they were gonna survive actually in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a sense and, ah, I mean, it's not [MN], oh, there was the times they were probably in danger I suppose but then there was always somebody there.  You gotta realise that there was a camera there --
L:  Yeah.
R:  --so there has to be other people, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, ah, it does show you how you can survive if you have to, I guess. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, there's [MN] the millionaire show, ah, that's [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, that's [MN] kind of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- comedy thing to me when I first watched it a couple of times.
L:  Yeah, it's just kind of sad, sort of.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, ah, you don't know who's -- who's playing who there, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in a sense, it's -- it -- ah, it -- somebody thinks they're getting a million dollars, [MN] --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- it's, ah, I don't know.  You know, people, for -- for money, they'll -- they do odd things, I guess.  
L:  Yeah, it's really misleading, 'cause they [MN] don't tell the participants what's going on exactly, so it's really just like a -- a contest about fame, so ...
R:  Yeah, I think you're right, yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, ah, oh, it's, I don't know, it -- I -- I can't get into them too much but, now, Fear Factor, I don't know if you ever -- did you ever watch that one?
L:  Um, I think I saw a little bit of that.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's kind of wild. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  That [MN] -- yeah, some of it's kinda gross.  I mean, [MN], you know--
L:  Yeah, it's crazy what people will do.
R:  Yeah, I mean, even for that amount of money, I mean, fifty thousand dollars -- it's -- it's -- it's a lot of money, yes, but some of the stuff they were doing [MN] I couldn't do it if -- if they handed me the fifty thousand and said, "Do that and I'll give it to you", and I -- I couldn't do that.  I just, ah, [MN] I mean, that's just, ah, a little too gross for me.
L:  Yeah, I agree.  
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Um, there's that new one with, um, Monica Lewinsky, I think.
R:  Oh.
L:  Have you heard about that one?
R:  Yeah, I never seen that one though.  I --
L:  Yeah, I haven't either but --
R:  I heard about -- you know, I heard about it and I guess it was -- first couple of shows, I guess it was quite popular from what I understand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, I, actually, I don't even know what it was really all about.
L:  [MN] I think what happened was, I guess, Monica Lewinsky was just maybe the host and, um, [MN] there's this woman and she had to, um, pick among these men but the catch was, um, she didn't know what these men looked like 'cause they always had to wear a mask.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, yeah, that's just what it was, I think.  But I never saw it.  I just -- I guess I read about it in a magazine or something.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I never -- I never seen it either.  I, ah, I knew that she was going to have a show but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I never really got the full fact of what, ah, [MN] oh, that's [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  I, ah -- I don't know.
L:  I guess that's what she's always wanted.  [MN]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She k- [MN] kinda went a long way around to get it, I guess.  I don't know that's, I mean, I don't know, but, ah, ah, the shows you know, ah, some of the shows you see are more sense in a reality than some of the ones they call reality too.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  You know, but, ah, I don't know, I -- [MN] winter time I watch TV quite a bit but summer time I like to get out, you know, I don't sit in and watch TV too much but--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, so ...
L:  I agree, 'cause after I watch too much I guess -- I guess I feel sort of useless or something so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I have to get out. [MN] Yeah. [MN]
R:  It does kind of get to you after a while, don't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, but it -- it's, ah, I guess, ah, I don't know, they're -- they're a popular type shows, I guess, I don't know, that's -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, that's what, ah --
L:  I'm g- --
R:  -- people like.  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I'm getting a little tired of it though.
R:  Yeah, ah, they get too much of one thing going and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's, ah, repetitious.  Ah ...
L:  Yeah, and I think they made some movies now that are based on the reality shows.
R:  [MN] That would be good.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's interesting but, um, I think one of them was kind of strange.  I didn't see it but it was based on, um, The Real World, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it just basically followed these, um, kids, um, over beach week, I guess, during spring break and so I heard some stories about that.  Um, I didn't really wanna see it but, you know, I guess it would have been kind of interesting but ... [NOISE]
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I didn't, ah, I didn't see that or hear about it, no.  But, ah, [MN] there's like -- I always thought too in, ah, this Survivor thing, they always had them in the hot areas, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I thought maybe, like, ah, some place in Alaska where it's real cold or something, let them survive that way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  See how they would do, you know. [MN]
L:  Um ...
R:  That would, ah [MN] -- but, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- I guess everybody's got their thing, I suppose --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know, but some what they call popular and, it's, ah, [MN] it -- it's supposed to, I don't know, ah, what would you say, it's, ah, [MN] mind release --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, kinda get ya, well, I suppose if you're in a sad position, I guess you'd watch something like that.  I guess you forget about your own problems --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you have to start listening to theirs and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, ah, it -- so, do you watch -- you don't watch too much of it then?  Too much [inaudible]?
L:  No, I don't watch much of it but, um, [MN] I just heard a lot about them -- about them.  I guess American Idol seems to be really popular now.
R:  [MN] Yes, ah, that's -- that's one of the top ones.  That's popular.
L:  Yeah, that one, yeah.  I guess they really like, um, the fact that, ah, they have a judge on American Idol who's very sarcastic and very cruel and I guess --
R:  Oh, what's that, ah, Simon?  Is that --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, he is.
L:  'Cause people -- yeah, I've never seen it but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I imagine he would be.
R:  I have seen him and I have heard his judgements and, ah, yeah, he -- he, ah, says what he thinks, I guess.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's the way you'd say it, but, and, ah ...
L:  I guess it's sort of refreshing in a way but at the same time I wonder if people kind of [MN] like other people to, I don't know, lose their dreams.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's just kind of sad but ...
R:  Well, yeah, I suppose, that, ah, but they're all striving too for, you know, their -- their, ah, niche and their stardom, I guess.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, and there was another one, now, called Fame or something like that.  Have you heard that one?
L:  Yeah, I think so, but I'm not sure what that is about.
R:  Well, it's -- it's basically in that same category --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, ah, it's, ah, all the kids sing and some dance and different things and they're judged also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's about in the same line.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, now there's another one on now, I think it's on every Thursday night.  It's called the Amazing Race.
L:  I don't know what that is.
R:  Well, it's, what it is, it -- it starts out as a group of twelve people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, twelve couples, that is, and they've -- they're given a certain amount of money and they've got to get from one point to the other using as little money as possible --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and they go from, well, [MN] ah, some areas they travel from one country to the other --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, ah, then they have to take different avenues to get to certain points and it's a race to, ah, see who c- --
