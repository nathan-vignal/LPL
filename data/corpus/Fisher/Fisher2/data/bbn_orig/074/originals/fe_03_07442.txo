R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Wendy.
L:  I'm Bitel[?] and I'm calling from Washington, Seattle.
R:  Okay.  Um, yeah, I -- I really like reality T.V. shows.  I ...
L:  That's good because I don't watch a lot and [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's good.  I -- I don't have a lot to say about them, but I -- I -- I have some -- I can, uh, get something, um, um, uh -- I don't -- I don't usually -- usually don't watch a lot of, uh, T.V. here.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, uh, we can still talk about the topic, um, uh ...  Sure.
R:  Sure.  Have you -- have you watched any reality shows at all?
L:  Yeah, uh, two -- two -- yeah, I've watched the dating shows.  I find it interesting how ...
R:  Which dating shows did you watch?
L:  [NOISE] Um, there's some, uh, called Elimidate I think and, um ...
R:  Oh, Elimi- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Eliminate a Date --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Eliminate a Date?
L:  Yeah.  Eliminate a Date.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, it's -- they are either, uh, four girls and one guy or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- four guys and one girl and then the, uh -- the one, uh, chooses of the others and they go all together out to dates and something.
R:  They -- they all go together on one date?
L:  Yeah, and then, uh, all the girls want, uh, to convince the guy and, uh, make, uh -- get free things and, um --
R:  Oh, that's funny.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and -- and so like they all try and, um, seduce the guy and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and one of them gets picked in the end?
L:  Yeah, and ...
R:  And what happens then?
L:  Then they go out.  I don't know if they're --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it d- depends on the price but, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it is not good for the other three for -- for sure and they, uh ...
R:  Oh, right.  Well, maybe they get a second chance though.
L:  Yes.  After they're eliminated to be -- after they're eliminated they say, oh, I -- I -- I didn't want him, uh, anyway or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, uh, I don't know if it is true.  But, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- at -- at the beginning all of them want him -- want him and -- and -- and that, and there are more.  I think there's -- there's, uh, one, um -- there's one who -- where two go out and, uh, um, at later times there's one, uh, dating program which is, uh, more, uh -- where they come more closer.  But I didn't watch the millionaire one and ...  What type of reality shows do you watch?  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, is there a frog in the background?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes, there's a frog here.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I'll keep to the topic though.  Um, I like -- I don't watch much T.V. either, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I really do like, um [LIPSMACK], The Surf, uh -- the -- the one on M.T.V. where the girls live in the surf house and they go surfing --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I like the surf so I can relate --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um ...
L:  Do you surf?
R:  Yes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but -- so all the girls they live in the surf house and they have competitions and they travel to, um, California -- well, no, actually they travel to Australia and --
L:  Oh.  [MN]
R:  -- Indonesia and different places and -- and, um, they get eliminated based on like if they're not surfing well enough or if they're whining too much.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, yeah -- so ...
L:  And, uh, are they all girls?  Are there no guys?
R:  They're -- they're just girls on that show, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- there's a show, um, that's starting to come out soon and it, uh -- it's not on M.T.V., it's on another, um, T.V. show, but it's just like a -- a group of like professional surfers --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I know some guys are in it, like Sonny Garcia and some people, and I don't remember, um -- you know, I -- I think they probably have girls in it too, like may- maybe Liza Anderson.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I -- I don't know.  Rochelle -- no, L- Liza Anderson.  She's a retired surfer.  But, um, yeah -- and that seems like a -- it's gonna be a fun show.  I don't know though --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when it's on.  I think that they're getting a house built on the north shore of Hawaii and --
L:  I see.
R:  -- that's where.
L:  Where are you living?
R:  Uh, in [inaudible].  But we are not -- we gotta stay to the topic.  Okay?  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Okay.  [LAUGH] Um, uh ...
R:  Well, so what other -- have you -- did you see Joe the Millionaire?
L:  I didn't see it, but I read about it and I listened to some, um, radio programs about the, uh, show and the program I was listening on K.P.S.U. was very much against the show.  They -- they ...
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  They didn't like the show the guy on the radio and, uh, he was always, uh, talk- -- for a couple of hours he talked against the show.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We shouldn't watch it.  They are, um --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- it's, uh -- somehow they are, um, cheating.  It's not right.  It's not honest and, uh --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's all about the money.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh, so -- so much people, uh, watch it.  So, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if so much people watch it there's a demand and, uh, it means that -- I -- I think that this means that, uh, quite a bit -- everybody is concerned, uh, about the money more than real love or, um, uh, finding the -- the marriage partner, the partners who, uh, some of them, uh, want to marry is, um, um -- should be rich or -- so that those people have more, uh, chance to get married to the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, the other per- person.  I don't know.  Did you watch it?
R:  Yeah.  I -- well, I only watched the very last episode --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it totally sucked me in.  So, I can understand how --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- these shows are so popular.  But, um, yeah, it was very, uh -- it made me cry [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- in the last episode just because it was so moving, but, uh, I felt so cheesy crying, but -- because I heard they broke up like right after.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, a lot of it was just a lotta hype and all.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I can see how they hook you in because it's way more -- you know, you -- you can relate so much more than if it's just like actors just pretending, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.  So, they were -- were really role playing in the show, it was not for real, it was only ...?
R:  Well, no, it was for real.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But the thing is it was like they were both taken, you know, out of their lives for a moment --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so they're in the middle of France in this chateau and, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were kinda like left to themselves and it was like all romantic and stuff.  But as soon as the real world set in and then they had to go back to their own lives and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they actually sent Joe like away to Hawaii I think for some trip for a while --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so that he wouldn't, um, get all harassed by, you know, the -- the public in terms of, you know, the news wanting to know what happened and everything and, uh, so they didn't get to see each other for like two months after --
L:  Two months.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they live on like other sides of the country.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, it doesn't make -- didn't make much sense I guess, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They'd only known each other for like a few days.  [LAUGH]
L:  For a few days and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that was the end.  Actually I think the guy it was about he wasn't a millionaire.
R:  No, he on- -- he was like a construction worker.
L:  Uh-huh.  I see.
R:  It was a front, but they got -- they each got like half a million dollars in the end.
L:  Oh, that's not bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not bad, no.
L:  Yeah, that's not bad.  So --
R:  That'd do it.
L:  -- they can -- they can create a whole new life --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with that money.
R:  There's -- there's another like cool show.
L:  Now, how 'bout that.
R:  Um, it's on M.T.V. --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I don't -- it's called like -- I don't remember what it's called, but like if somebody has a dream, like say they wanna be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a, uh -- a cheerleader or say they wanna be --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a famous rock band or --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- whatever they like -- M.T.V. hooks them up with like a coach and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, just like really works with them for like --
L:  Really?
R:  -- nine months or however long --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, you know, tries to help 'em to like obtain that dream of whatever the dream was and that's kinda fun.  That's a neat show.
L:  So, reality shows are kind of fun and they also, uh, shows a -- a lot of aspects of real life.  So, I mean, if you watch a movie there is not much past -- after the movie.  You enjoyed the time, the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the time you watch the movie, but, uh, by the time -- if one movie is a copy of another movie, uh, but the reality shows they, uh, teach us more about the instincts of people I think.
R:  Um, the instincts?
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I, uh, uh -- how -- how the people are.  Actually you can, uh, learn more in real life, in -- in daily life about a person.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, these people on the reality shows they are in other cities, they have -- I mean, you see how much different they are from us, but at the s- same time how much alike and, uh ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, there -- there is a reason, um, it's, uh -- there's a reason that there's a demand for these reality shows and I really think you -- I -- I think I -- I will watch more and I will -- will watch more M.T.V. for that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- program you mentioned.  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, some of it's kind of bad, you know?  But, I mean, some of it I feel bad watching when it's over just 'cause it's so, um -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like they totally like pick on people and stuff on some of those shows.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I -- I don't know.  Some are good.
L:  Yes.
R:  Like I saw one show like last night where they were, um -- some people, like they felt -- they didn't have m- -- very much confidence when it came to dating --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so they hired a dating coach.
L:  Really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  For the people so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they had -- they had coached before the -- the program show?
R:  Right.  And some -- for some it worked out.  For some nah, it didn't really work out.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it is -- you can fake, uh, uh -- I mean, a habit.  I mean, the program will, uh, finish after the final.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I -- I know -- I know, rea-, uh -- reality T.V. because they are real -- I mean, because they are not placed it's not a, um ...  I don't know if I can express myself.  Uh, it's because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's very much --
