L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Uh, where are you from?
R:  Uh, Grants Pass, Oregon.
L:  Um, I'm from Pennsylvania.
R:  Pennsylvania?
L:  Yes.
R:  Well, that's a little ways from here.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about our favorite holidays --
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  -- for ten -- ten minutes.
R:  My name is Howard.
L:  My name is Gloria.
R:  Hi, Gloria.
L:  [NOISE] Uh --
R:  Uh [LIPSMACK] yeah, do you have a favorite holiday?
L:  I think my favorite holiday is Christmas. [COUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think it's, um, too commercialized but I think what is really important that is all my [COUGH] family get together.  We're all here for a meal and, uh [LIPSMACK] to visit with each other and to take what we have left and celebrate because as you get older you don't have all your family here. [MN] What do you --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  What's your favorite holiday?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Uh, probably Thanksgiving and Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, for the -- for almost the same reasons.  It's a good time for family to get together.
L:  Right.
R:  Special time, anyway.
L:  And the kids are ex- -- so excited and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  We have two grandchildren that live near me, they will be three and five this year.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  The little girl is five and -- and the little boy will be three --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they enjoy Christmas a lot.  They're just learning -- learning about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have any children or grandchildren?
R:  Children and grandchildren and great grandchildren.
L:  I have some great grandchildren, too but I'm only sixty but I have a great grandchildren is because my son married a girl that was older --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and adopted her children.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, um, I am a grandma and great grandma and everybody comes for Christmas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or if they can't come for Christmas they come for, uh, Christmas Eve --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I like 'em to come for Christmas, though, because we're all here but sometimes they have to go to the other side of the family.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, so I have Christmas Eve --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then we have, like, sandwiches and cookies and all the goodies and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hot chocolate.
R:  That's good.
L:  How do you celebrate Christmas and hol- --
R:  We, um, [LAUGH] -- and hadn't -- hadn't really thought about it. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  We, uh -- we, um -- all of our kid -- or most of the kids are -- are living away from us --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so, uh -- but, uh, uh, we either try to get together, like I said, on Thanksgiving or Christmas and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, uh, we either go to them.  We have, uh, one son in -- in, uh, Florida, we have, uh -- I have another son, uh, in Wisconsin --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] -- and, uh, so we -- we try to get around a little bit but -- but -- but we haven't lately and then -- the -- we have a [MN] --
L:  That [COUGH] -- that makes it a little harder.
R:  Well, it does and -- and uh, uh, we have one daughter in -- in, uh, Vancouver, Washington, which is about two hundred and fifty miles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from us and that's probably the -- the ones we get together with the most --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because -- because of the distance of the rest of 'em --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh, so they either come down one year or we go up and -- and, uh, sa- -- same with Thanksgiving and Christmas.
L:  Mhm.  It's just a special time o' year with a special feeling.  You can just feel it, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you wish that people would treat people that way a little more during the year and think back that special feeling that's there --
R:  That --
L:  -- at Christmas.
R:  That's exactly right.  It's like you said, they really commercialize it so much, though.  All the holidays they do, in fact.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, what kind of work do you do?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I'm, uh -- I've been in the construction business, uh, do subdivisions and underground utilities and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, that nature, uh --
L:  I do --
R:  I re- --
L:  I do private duty --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Oh, yeah, private duty care.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I'm not working right now because of my back but the last lady, um, I worked for up until January, twenty second, or December twenty second, was eighty eight --
R:  Ooh.
L:  -- and, uh, her son put up the Christmas tree and I helped decorate it and she told me where to put everything.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I thought it looked pretty much but she'd always make me change things around --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I tried to keep, um, [LIPSMACK] Christmas, uh, spiritually with her.  I read the Christmas story to her out of the Bible and, uh, just things like that and, um, we made Christmas cookies together.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mixed them up and she dropped them and we talked about Christmases past as we did this, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was anything to keep her morale up, to keep her mentally alert which I thought was nice.
R:  Yeah, that's nice, that's neat.
L:  Yeah, I -- I like that kind of work.  I worked in a nursing home in the activity department before that --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and we did a lot of things with Christmas, um, with the residents in, uh, cooking class.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Busy Bakers, we called it.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  And we -- we baked, uh, uh, Christmas cookies and we let them decorate it and ... so they could feel more at home and have the smell of baking, like you'd have at home on a holiday and things like that.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, have the smell in the home, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, have you had any other calls?
R:  I've had two others, uh-huh.
L:  I -- this is my second one.  The first lady was from Florida.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Did you give your Social Security number?
R:  Uh-uh.
L:  I didn't either, no.
R:  No, I was, um, uh -- I was told by the friends that -- that introduced us to the program that -- that, uh -- to just say zero, zero, zero and just --
L:  I didn't write anything in the space --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um --
R:  Yeah --
L:  Um --
R:  -- because it's just not good to do that over the phone.
L:  No.  Now, at Thanksgiving we used to go to my husband's family and when his mother died we go to his sister's now --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and all the family gets together.  I think the furthest one away is New York --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, Buffalo.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And a lot of them, they all come in sometimes for Thanksgiving and then we have the turkey and all the trimmings and stuff like that and that's one of the time of years that, um, the family gets together on my husband's side.
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  So, um --
R:  That's, um --
L:  Does your wife make any of the cranberries and nut breads and all that kind of stuff for Christmas?
R:  No, but she makes -- she makes -- she just makes a lot of cookies and --
L:  Does she?
R:  And stuff like that, yeah, yeah.
L:  I'm a -- I'm a cookie fan, I love cookies.
R:  Oh, I love cookies, yeah, yeah.
L:  I think that's my downfall.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Cookies. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I can think of other things that are a lot worse, Gloria. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I used to bake cookies and -- and give them to my aunts and uncles and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When they got older and they lost a spouse or they wasn't able to make them anymore and I used to give them big boxes of cookies for Christmas.  My aunt gave me some money one year and she said, "You make good cookies".
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know.  If you think how much, uh, margarine or butter or stuff like that you put in the cookies --
R:  Oh boy.
L:  -- if you could just space them out a little more, you know.  Save some for Easter or --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- freeze them or something.
R:  Yeah, right.  Yeah, there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It take a lot of good stuff , that's why they taste good.
L:  I know.  Up in -- up in here sometimes they give sleigh rides at Christmas.  They probably do where you -- well, in the winter they give sleigh rides.  They probably do where you are, too?
R:  No, we -- we haven't had snow in years.
L:  Oh, haven't ya?
R:  No, uh, and if we do get a little bit, why it doesn't, uh -- it doesn't last long enough.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  I remember when I was a little kid.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, I was about, oh, six or seven years old and -- and -- and that winter it did snow about, uh, ten or twelve inches --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and stay -- and froze and then stayed on the ground a couple weeks and I wanted a sled so bad the next Christmas and I got one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it never snowed after that.
L:  Right.  Well, we --
R:  But we had a hillside, uh, a driveway --
L:  Mhm.
R:  A neighbor's driveway and it was granite --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and what I'd do is I'd get out there and I wore that sleigh out just ri- -- riding on the granite --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- going down -- [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Going down the hill. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, well we have [NOISE] quite a lot of snow.  Sometimes we don't have a green [NOISE] Christmas but, uh -- I mean, a white Christmas but the last few years, uh, we've had quite a lot of snow.
R:  Yeah, you get -- you get more of an opportunity for it than we do here, yeah.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  We're, uh -- we're kinda in a protected valley, you -- you might say and it just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, our elevation's only about a thousand feet and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so we don't, uh -- we just don't get the snow.
L:  Well, we do and as you get older, the cold weather --
