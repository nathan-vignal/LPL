L:  Hi, this is Lisa in Minnesota.
R:  Oh, hi, my name's Christopher from, uh, Chicago.
L:  Hi Christopher, how are you?
R:  Oh, I'm fine.  And yourself?
L:  Good thank you.  So, have you -- have you done one of these calls before?
R:  I've done a couple of them.
L:  Yeah.  They're kinda neat, uh?  You start talking and about ten minutes later they're ready to disconnect you and you want to keep going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, um, family, or holidays.  Is that what it was?
R:  Yeah, it's holidays.  What's your favorite holiday and why and if you could create a new holiday what would it be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and why.  Interesting. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, it is, um, [LIPSMACK] how about you?
R:  Well, I'd have to say my favorite holiday is Halloween.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And why?  Because, well, uh, frankly most of the other holidays are boring and also --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- free candy.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  You know, hey, free candy, hm?
L:  Right, right, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have kids? [NOISE]
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  No.
L:  Okay, is -- but so -- so do you go out for trick or treating?
R:  Oh, no, not -- not particularly --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, uh, you know, I do pretty much make the rounds of the Halloween parties.
L:  Do ya?  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.  Hang on one sec, okay?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I got a -- hang on, my dog. [NOISE] Yeah, all the time.  Hi, sorry about that.
R:  Oh, not a problem.
L:  My dog's lonely.  He needs -- he needs a holiday to happen.
R:  Oh --
L:  I'd have a dog holiday.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  I would.
R:  [SIGH] So what's your -- what's your --
L:  A animal holiday
R:  What's your favorite holiday, then?
L:  Um [NOISE] my favorite holiday is the fourth of July. [NOISE]
R:  Ah, cool.
L:  Yeah, 'cause my birthday's the fifth and, I don't know, it's summer and I love the [NOISE] fireworks.
R:  Ah, cool.
L:  They're beautiful.
R:  Cool.
L:  Good time of year, everybody's outside, laying on the grass, out barbecuing.
R:  Ah, cool.
L:  What do you think of that?
R:  Yeah, it's a pretty good, uh, one.  My dad's got his birthday close to the fourth, uh, himself, he's on July second.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  So we usually have some fun --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that sort of thing.
L:  Cool.
R:  So as far as making a holiday, mm, it's just there's so many out there and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, this month alone it's, uh, National, uh, Accordion Appreciation Month and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- National Dairy Month.
L:  This month it is?
R:  Yep.
L:  National Dairy Month?  I haven't never even heard of that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] No, I haven't.
R:  Let's see if I could pick a holiday though, mm, I'd say something in spring, possibly relating to, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know, reading or something like that.  Yeah --
L:  Reading?
R:  -- okay how about National Visit a Library Day.
L:  National Visit a Library Day?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's a good one.  No, I have a good --
R:  Have it sometime in spring.
L:  I gotta good one.  You know how they have Grandparents' Day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Mother's Day, Father's -- they need to have a kids' day.  Parents go to work or kids go to work, they need to have just a kids' day.
R:  Yeah, that could work.
L:  What do you think of that?
R:  Yeah, that could work.  Do you have any children?
L:  Yeah, I have a son.  He's fourteen.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.  And he -- he thinks -- he agrees me, we've actually had this conversation before.
R:  Mm.
L:  We -- we -- we wonder why there's not kids' day, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day, which is today.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd better call my Dad. [LAUGH] Um, yeah, so kids' day, I think we should have kids' day.
R:  Uh, that could be, uh, kinda interesting.  Uh, when would you want to have it?
L:  I guess the kids would -- the kids could take a vote, probably summer, no probably a day during the school year so they could get school off. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.  Have it on Monday, three day weekend.
L:  What's that?
R:  Have it on a Monday, it'd be a three day weekend then.
L:  Right, right, yeah, yeah, that'd be perfect.  Or on a Friday --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- then they could take Friday, Saturday, Sunday off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then they'd have the whole weekend.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they could do -- you know, have Thursday -- I think having Thursday nights off would be better than Sunday night to not go Monday.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But, I don't know, otherwise, uh -- do -- do you celebrate all the holidays?
R:  Uh, well, not -- not particularly.  Um, I tend to be pretty busy with work a lot.  I know when all them are, I just don't celebrate them.  I have to do the, uh, month's, uh, reading lists at the library.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'm a librarian, so ...
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  Mhm.  So pretty much, uh, round about the fifteenth of every month I'm sitting down looking at the next month and figuring out what we're going to do display wise --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  -- and that sort of thing.
L:  So, do you have family where you're at, then?
R:  Uh, no, I'm pretty much by myself.  I'm --
L:  Okay, okay, um --
R:  Yeah, my family's, um, you know -- you know, in the area but I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know but I'm a little bit separate from them.
L:  Kinda -- yeah, I hear ya, I know what you mean.  Um, so like Christmases and stuff, you used to when you were a child but not anymore?
R:  [SIGH] No, we get together for Christmas but, you know, other than that I usually don't see them.
L:  Oh, okay, yeah.
R:  I'm usually so socked up with work.
L:  Right, right, okay.
R:  And yourself?
L:  Li- -- librarian keeps you that busy, huh?
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm constantly, uh, learning new things and going --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and getting more education and piling stuff on, as it were. [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, but I'm happy.
L:  [NOISE] Right, right.
R:  It's what I like to do.
L:  Um, what -- what st- -- what state are you in, again?
R:  Uh, state of Illinois.
L:  Illinois?  Did you say Illinois?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you're not far from me in Minnesota.
R:  Yep.
L:  Hm.
R:  So, what you, uh, do for a living?
L:  I am a nurse.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yep, it's a -- I -- I'm actually looking to change occupations here soon.  I -- I don't know what I want to do when I grow up but I'm almost thirty three. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  [NOISE] Oh yeah, no, I had a son -- I had a child so young and now he's fourteen, I -- and I, you know -- I can't believe this much time has passed.
R:  No.
L:  And for years I've been saying, "Oh, I have to get -- I don't want to be a --" I love the health care field, however, um, I do home health care and I mostly take care of respite or, you know, respite patients that are -- respite patients or patients that are, you know, dying and it's -- it's my weakness. [NOISE] It -- it's depressing --
R:  Yeah, it sounds like --
L:  -- 'cause I get too close to these people so ...
R:  -- it could take a real toll.
L:  Yeah, it does, I mean, there's -- [MN] there's been a few times when I -- I've gone to work and -- actually it was very odd, about four years ago, three days in a row I went and my client was gone and -- when I got there.
R:  Wow.
L:  Three days in a row, three different people.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, I took a br- -- break for about six months at that point. [LAUGH]
R:  That seems like a very good idea.
L:  It's -- it's -- it is burn out.
R:  Yeah.  Fortunately I'm lucky that there's not much burn out in my line of work.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] librarian.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You're just around quietness all day.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Peace, right? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, no.
L:  No?
R:  There are days -- oh, oh, heck no.
L:  You're at the library, come on.
R:  No, it's pretty loud in a library these days.
L:  Is it really?
R:  With story times and the computer lab and people talking.  We -- we don't --
L:  Oh, you know what you -- the library has that I want to get?  The -- the book -- um, what -- what is that book?  The book that has all the reverse searches, you know, reverse numbers.  What is that book called?  You can't buy it.  You can ask the librarian to see it and look up something for you.
R:  Well, that -- that directory generally, um, we -- we've gone over to the online source 'cause it's a little bit faster 'cause it --
L:  What -- what is it called?
R:  Um, well to be --
L:  I keep forgetting.
R:  -- honest, I don't use the paper one that much, uh, but I think it's, uh, one of the Information Please almanacs.
L:  I'm sorry, what's that?
R:  Has the -- has the number -- has the reverse number look up.  Most of --
L:  But, like, for addresses and all that, too.
R:  Yeah --
L:  What's the website, do you know? [NOISE]
R:  Well, um, one of the websites you can get to it from is a thing called, uh, L.I.I. dot org.  Just a second.
L:  Bill?  B. as in boy?
R:  No, L. --
L:  [NOISE] My --
R:  -- as in Larry.
L:  Okay.
R:  I.I. dot O.R.G.
L:  Dot R.G. as in George.  My dog is barking.
R:  Yeah.
L:  L. -- Larry, icicle, icicle dot rose dot George?
R:  Uh, uh, no, not -- uh, O. as in orange, uh, R. as in Robert --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- G. as in gamp[?], org.
L:  Oh, org?
R:  Yes.
L:  L.I.I. dot org?
R:  Yeah, it's the librarian's index to the internet.  Uh, that's one that, uh, we use --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to get to some of the databases.
L:  [NOISE] Shut him up, please.  [MN] do -- shut -- put his muzzle on.  Sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, not a problem.
L:  My dog wants attention right now.
R:  Oh, they can --
L:  He's high maintenance.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] So, yeah, so I can go to L.I.I. dot org and then get my stuff that way?
R:  Yeah, it's, uh -- there's, uh -- let's see, where's that?  Uh --
L:  Isn't the book called the Blue Book, um, the Blue Book or Black Book org or something?
R:  Well, there's that --
L:  I don't know, if I can use it online, that's even better.
R:  Yeah, there's a couple of them.  Uh, one's the L.I.I. dot org and, let's see, what's the other one?
L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, sorry.  Okay, that -- did you just -- that's one of 'em, what's -- is there another one?
R:  Uh, another good one for researching is, uh, the Internet Public Library.
