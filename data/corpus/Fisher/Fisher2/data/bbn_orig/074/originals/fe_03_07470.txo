L:  [SIGH]  You see I got sick of everything so I don't know.  So, tell me.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]  No, I just think that we should be pulling out of there ... because, y- y- you know the way they're just fighting amongst themselves and ... t- the US soldiers are r- really getting, you know, hammered now.  [SIGH]  [MN]  But --
L:  Right.  Actually, I -- I'm serious, I'm not kidding, I quit watching.  I quit watching and when it comes on I shut it off every time.  I don't even want to pay attention.  It makes me sick.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't watch it like I used to but, you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- know, it's kind of hard to avoid.  It's on the front page of the papers and [SIGH] --
L:  I, [LAUGH] -- yeah, I only get that on Sundays.
R:  Mm.
L:  I ... d- don't want to pay attention to it right now.  I'm so sick of it I just think this world needs just ... peace!  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, well I don't think we're ever going to see that.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean we've been at war for ... twelve years, a- as far as I'm concerned.

L:  It's -- but I mean -- if -- if -- we're -- we're there trying to help them people aren't we?
R:  [MN]  Yeah, but I don't -- I don't think they understand.  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  Well you know, -- [LAUGH] yeah, I don't think so either --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- either that or, maybe, they just don't want help.  I mean, oh, my gosh!  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know
L:  Yeah, it's -- yeah, we do got to get out.  It's -- how long has it been?  [NOISE]  Ah, it's been, ah, how many months ... a couple of months now?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  A- ah --
L:  Three months?
R:  -- was it November we went over -- or was it --

R:  Oh!
L:  -- three months?
R:  Yeah, I'm not really sure.  It --
L:  It's -- it's really --
R:  -- hasn't been that long.
L:  -- it's really sad.  It's really sad.
R:  Oh, I know it's -- [SIGH] I don't want to pay out of our taxpayers' money to rebuild that place.  [COUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  I never even thought -- I haven't thought of that yet.
R:  Yeah!
L:  But that -- yeah, that's [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- good point.  Well --
R:  Because we have, like, Vietnam.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're still rebuilding on that one.  [SIGH]
L:  What a -- you know, we have people s- starving.  Wh- where are --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you from?
R:  Maine.
L:  Oh, I'm in Minnesota.  [SIGH]  I mean, you know, we've got people starving here and, ah, I -- I was going to say check out our welfare but you're not here.  [SIGH]  Highest paying welfare state.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and, yeah -- and we're paying for [SIGH] stuff that we blow up.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  I know, um, we have a lot of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, not that I'm racist or anything, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but we get a lot of Somalians coming in --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] to -- to Maine.
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  And they're bringing in their families.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And there was a big spiel on CNN about the mayor said, "No, more --"
L:  Oh!
R:  "-- Don't bring any more of your family over".  Well, phew, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- all hell -- all hell broke l- loose [LAUGH] on that one.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  But, you know, these people got on the top of the list now [MN] and they're demanding four bedroom apartments.
L:  Oh, uh-uh.  Really?
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Oh, four bedroom apartments.
L:  Yeah, and they're not even Americans.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And the people that have been on that waiting list for years, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, that have lived here, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- generations of 'em --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're put back, you know, they're down the bottom now.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, my -- [SIGH] wow!  [NOISE]
R:  And I -- I can see --
L:  [NOISE]  I didn't k- know that.
R:  Yeah, I -- [SIGH] you know, and it -- it's like that down in Mass- too, you get all these immigrants coming in.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]
R:  And, you know -- before long you're going to see the Iraqis come in too.
L:  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  But I don't mind, you know, feeding starving people but, my God, when you look just down the streets of -- Main Street -- I live in a small town --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you see p- people and kids and [SIGH] --
L:  That need food and c- clothing and shelter and --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- right -- yeah, that's th- -- that's the same thing I was saying about here in Minnesota.  [SIGH]  I mean they're -- I guess -- well, you're in Maine.  I guess down south [SIGH] there's pro- -- I -- there's signs posted, like, in the bathrooms, "You want welfare? --"
R:  Mm.
L:  "-- Go to Minnesota they pay four thirty seven a month for one kid"
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well --
L:  You know, ah -- th- that's [NOISE] -- yeah, so --
R:  Yeah, it -- you know, it all gets down to money issues too because [SIGH] wh- -- we're paying, I forget what the daily total was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as what it was costing us to bomb and have the guys there over in Iraq, [SIGH] you know?
L:  Uh-hum.  I -- yeah, I don't know what it is.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- you know, it was -- they're estimating fifty billion.  Well you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's going to go over that.
L:  Oh, for sure.
R:  You know, but, um, --
L:  For sure.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I just think we've done our duty and --
L:  It's over.
R:  -- I don't know if we'll ever catch the guy.  I don't.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah, they keep t- thinking they've got whoever or --
R:  I know.
L:  -- [SIGH] i- it -- it's not -- I -- I don't think it's ever going to end to tell you the truth.
R:  No, I --
L:  It's never going to end.
R:  -- I think he was well hidden, you know.
L:  Y- yeah.  I -- I don't --
R:  [SIGH]  And, ah --
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't think it's going to [SIGH] -- we're always going to have a problem with -- with them -- with -- i- if Saddam Hussein is alive we're going to have problems all the time.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's just like the Tower being --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they're starting up again.
L:  For -- yeah, what -- what are we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what would you do -- if you were P- President?  [LAUGH]
R:  If I was President I -- you know, he's --
L:  Blow 'em up?
R:  -- he's right here in -- with his father down in Kennebunk-.  [LAUGH]
L:  Blow 'em up right?
R:  [LAUGH]  No way.
L:  Get done.  Get it over with?  What?  I mean --
R:  Get out of there.  Get the guys out.  Bring 'em home.
L:  But what about Saddam?  Quit -- kill him, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, if you can find him.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean -- we gotta -- you know, some- -- y- yeah, [LAUGH] I don't get that one either.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  W- where is the guy --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- all of the time?  I mean there's got to be somebody that sees him somewhere?  [SIGH]  He --
R:  Well, you know, --
L:  -- can't live --
R:  -- [SIGH] he, um, I had --
L:  -- he's so paranoid.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- he -- you know he dresses as a -- a commoner and he goes into anybody's home and -- and just stays there.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  You -- you never know when he's going to show up.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why I don't pay attention any more.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  Yeah, he's pretty sneaky.
L:  Wow!
R:  But I'd like to know where his family is.  His wife ...
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my.  Yeah.
R:  No, I -- I -- I, um, you know, I'm -- I am getting, I think they should start pulling 'em out because, you know, now they're, um, the war -- I think it was yesterday [SIGH] they were ambushed.  Someone s- squealed and they were waiting for the US soldiers.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE]  R- really?
R:  So, there's a lot of leaks now.
L:  I'm going to have to watch TV tonight.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  The news.
R:  I don't know it's --
L:  I'll try CNN and catch for a while.
R:  -- you know, it's ah -- [COUGH]
L:  But -- but, really, 'cause I really don't know what's going on.  I don't -- I like -- lately, like once every three weeks I'll turn the TV on.  [SIGH]  Just like with the -- the -- this aint on the subject but that -- [MN] Peterson guy -- Lacy -- you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] I -- I can't watch that no more -- I'm -- it just makes me sick.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I mean just all of it -- the new- -- it's all -- you know, I want to watch something happy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, good luck.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, bring our people home, you know?  [SIGH]
R:  Y- [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  Then we can watch something happy.
R:  Well, you know, it was good to see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess -- what three or four ships came in now.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah.  And, ah, you know, over the course -- since December I guess.
L:  Mm.
R:  Some of 'em have returned home so -- but there's still, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a hundred and fifty thousand --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- US soldiers over there.  [MN]  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, there's --
R:  And -- [SIGH] ah, I will not support anything from France --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, because of the -- the way they were shooting their mouths off I just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- phew --
L:  Yeah, thank God for the Germans, you know.  [SIGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  Hey, they're sal- -- ah, we're all working with each other here and look at they were talking, yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, look at what we did for France.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  I mean World War Two we went in there,--
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And they turned round --
L:  A lot of people died.
R:  Yeah, for them.
L:  For them, yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  So, but Iraq is -- I don't know, it's going to be a hot topic for many, many years --
L:  That's -- that's definitely --
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] Iraq.
L:  -- a fact.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, but you know, the oil I think that's what's talking --
L:  The oil?
R:  -- the oil fields.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And w- we do need --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the oil.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, we do.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, what I don't understand about the oil is [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- why is that the only place we can get it?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, there's a few countries --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they're so oil rich, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, did you see the oil fields they have?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Unbelievable!
L:  Really?
R:  Like, they had over seven hundred that they were afraid were going to get blown up.  [SIGH]  Because remember wh- when we went in for, ah, Desert Storm --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he lit up all of 'em?  He blew 'em up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And that was the one thing they went to guard first was the oil fields above everything else.
L:  Is that when our gas went up right away?
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, probably.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] no kidding -- yeah, Oh, my gosh, it just needs to s- stop.  Why don't we [NOISE] -- h- hey when has there ever been peace [NOISE] here do you know?  Can you -- can you s- seriously re- --
R:  I think there was a lull in between the Vietnam war and that was because of the fiasco --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- where we never should have been in the first place.  [SIGH]  And then for the next [SIGH] few years, u- um, th- -- we didn't have anything going on.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  You know, you had, um --
L:  I -- I -- I -- what I recall [SIGH] -- I don't remember all -- any of t- this war [NOISE] the crazy stuff at all until my son -- well my son's fourteen -- the first war we had, Operation ... what was it?
R:  Desert Storm?
L:  Yeah, Desert Storm, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that was his -- f- first war in his lifetime, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  --like, in ninety one or something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I don't think it's stopped since then.  I mean --
R:  Yeah, I think -- [SIGH] I think that was my son's too.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  He's s- seventeen --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so that would have been --
L:  Yeah, so it would have been his first one, yeah, also.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  'Cause I remember it -- I said, "Oh my God we're at war".  Saving the paper and s- stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that -- I don't think I remember 'cause I don't think I believ- -- I don't r- recall there being much peace s- since about that time.
R:  N- no.
L:  Maybe, just for a little bit here and there.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, because then you've got [SIGH] Cambodia.  You've got South Africa.  They're always going at it.  You got, [LIPSMACK] you know, every country has --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some kind of squabble going on and for some reason we've always --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- gotten in the middle of it.  Trying to control it.  [SIGH]
L:  R- right.  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  You know ...
L:  [NOISE]  I don't know.  What do you think of, ah, [SIGH] the President?
R:  [SIGH]  [MN]  I -- I like him.
L:  Do you?
R:  Yeah.  I, ah -- I'm glad -- y- you know, when I look at him versus -- when Clinton was in office, [SIGH] ah, Clinton was Desert Storm, right?
