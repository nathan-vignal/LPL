R:  Michael.
L:  Hi.  Elizabeth.
R:  How's it going?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Very good thank you.  So, what do you think is worse?
L:  I'm not sure.  Maybe smoking.
R:  That's right.  Yep.  I agree.
L:  I think -- just 'cause it seems to cause more damage and it can harm other people, not only yourself.
R:  And the environment too because everybody who smokes if you look around, you walk anywhere, you see butts all over the ground.
L:  No kidding.
R: So, it's not just even the person that's smoking.  It's the people that are affected by it and the environment too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I agree.
L:  So ...  But not exercising is still pretty bad, as well as overeating.
R:  That's right.
L:  So ...
R:  Now, what part of the country are you in?
L:  Um, Eastern United States, southeast.
R:  Oh, cool.  Like Virginia or something?
L:  No, more like Georgia.
R:  Oh, wow!  Cool.
L:  So ...  What about ...?
R: Well, I was in Massachusetts, but now I'm in the State of Washington.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, we're at totally opposite ends.  [LAUGH]
R:  We're what?
L:  We're at totally opposite ends of the country.
R:  Yep.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Complete diagonals.  That's funny.
R:  Yeah.  Sometimes you just gotta do it.  But, yeah, it's -- it's actually, um -- it's nice and -- and on the exercise level it's really nice out here because the outdoors are really pretty and they give you a lot of -- just a lot of varied terrain.  [NOISE]  So, you know, you can really get out and just do whatever kind of activity you want.
L:  Right.  Unfortunately here it's not the case.  Well, it's nice 'cause it's flat.  It's also extremely humid and so ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, Georgia's actually not flat 'cause you guys -- the Appalachian Trail goes from Stone Mountain in Georgia --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the way up to Maine.  So, you guys actually have some really nice country out in Georgia too.  But, yeah, it does get hot down there.
L:  Yeah.  But I live on the coastline.  So, near the beach.  So, the city that I live in is extremely flat.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  But I bet it's really nice this time of year too 'cause you just go right out the door and, what, you can be at the beach within minutes, huh?
L:  Yeah.  And the -- like the humidity kills you, so you don't wanna go out the door.
R:  Yeah.  I understand.
L:  That's the only thing.
R:  That's true.
L:  So ...
R:  So, are you in school?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  What school?
L:  Armstrong, um --
R:  Oh, cool.  Cool.
L:  -- but, uh, ed- -- I mean, I'm there for education.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  And you like it?
L:  Yes, I do.  I like it very much.
R:  That's cool.  And you're like originally from Georgia?
L:  Yes.
R:  That's nice.
L:  I'm originally from Atlanta.
R:  See, now that's good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's good.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, Georgia -- I -- I definitely like the Eastern United States too.  But, yeah, I do think it's really important like to be able to get outside and -- and, uh, you know, to be able to enjoy and -- and just do the things that, you know, put a big old smile on your face.
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
R:  For sure.  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  But ...  Oh, man, right now we're looking at my cat.  He's got a banana peel on his back.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He's -- he's outta control.  He is like the most outta control cat you'll ever wanna meet in your life.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's really funny.
R:  Yeah.  We keep him inside because we don't -- 'cause cats like to go out and like kill all kinds of animals --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like little birds and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, these guys are like six months old.  We -- we adopted them.  They're, um -- we adopted them -- it's brother and sister actually --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we got them when they were like eight or ten weeks old or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they're just -- the male is re- -- he's just a real goof.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's just -- you can't believe the things he does and it just makes you scratch your head and shake your head and walk away 'cause you just can't relate to it all.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's really ...
R:  It's really -- yeah.  And we had a dog too.  So, all -- actually the dog makes us go out for exercise.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, we definitely get, you know, enough of that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's all good.  So, you don't smoke?
L:  No, I don't smoke.
R:  Good.  That's cool.
L:  I hang around a lot of smokers and that's why I know it's bad.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  Do you give 'em a bunch of crap for it?
L:  Sometimes.
R:  Cool.
L:  Like the other night I told them I couldn't breathe anymore.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But, um, it -- really they don't feel it and like I could feel my throat closing up and that's sort of when I decided it's probably one of the worst things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you could possibly do just 'cause it affects so many different people.
R:  Yeah, for sure.  It really does.  And it's -- it's good too, you know -- it's -- it's funny 'cause I don't think that it's wrong for them to like not allow people to smoke in restaurants --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and other public places too because, you know, although it's -- it's a smoker's right to smoke --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so to speak, but it's such a habit and it's such a thing that when they decide that they wanna smoke people who don't smoke and don't have -- suddenly their choice is taken away not to smoke because of a sudden they have smoke floating in their face and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?  So, it is kind of a tough thing and it's really controversial.  But I think it kind of amazes me that -- that with all the stuff that's going on with cigarettes and all the facts that have been proven on what it does that there's still, you know, a population out there that -- that still smokes.
L:  Yep.
R:  You know?  And I know it's a habit and I know it's an addiction and everything else and it's kinda tough to break, but you'd almost think that just knowing everything we know today about it they'd still -- work a lot harder to quit.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh -- and I guess -- I guess we're getting toward that.  Nobody's perfect.  So ...
L:  No.  But it amazes me is what peop- -- that when people start doing it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like I don't understand when people start to do it these days.
R:  Right.  Well, its usually the younger people that do it too like, you know, in their early teens --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because they -- they do.  It -- the conception is that they still think it's cool --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, uh -- and then some of 'em end up walking away from it.  But, yeah, you're right, it's like -- it is kinda amazing that they start and I guess when you're -- they're that young you don't really relate to all the sickness and illness that -- that the cigarettes can bring.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So [LIPSMACK], it's kind of, uh, one of the big things.  So, what do you do for exercise?
L:  Oh, I take a water aerobics class.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yep.
L:  It's a lotta fun.
R:  Yeah, that must be fun.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Do you take that like at school?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  That's cool.
L:  So, I get credit for doing something fun.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  That I don't have to do any work for.
R:  You know what's also cool?  Like at some colleges, like we -- we took a dance class last year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like they had like a Lindy [NOISE] -- Lindy Hop class, which is cool.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  Because -- and I'm sure they probably have it like in, you know, schools over there too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's just like kind of like an extra curricula thing, but it's kinda cool because, you know, yeah, you're -- you're basically getting credits for just dancing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]  I get credit for going to swim --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- for forty five minutes.
R:  Yeah.  That is.  That's really cool.  I think that's -- that's a really good thing too.
L:  Like and having it at a class keeps you going.
R:  Yes.
L:  Like you can't just say, "Oh, I don't really feel like going today.  I'm not going go".  That's my biggest problem is getting the motivation to get up and go do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But once I start doing it I -- I really, really enjoy it.  But getting myself to go do it, like this -- the initial part is really hard.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And that's -- yeah, that's a problem that a lotta people have with exercise is they really wanna do it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's the motivation level, you know, and it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just kind of incorporating it and they say -- I guess there's stats out there that say that most people who do start an exercise program --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- fall off it within like six months --
L:  Right.
R:  -- 'cause it's really hard to commit to it.  But if you get past that six month thing they say you have a really good chance of, you know, permanently incorporating it into your -- your life.  So ...
L:  And it is -- it is time consuming.  Like that's the other thing is it's definitely time consuming.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It is not just the ten minutes you go to walk.  It's the changing into the clothes and -- you know, which takes a few minutes and actually getting ready to go and then going --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and coming back and taking a shower and, I mean, you could easily spend two hours -- you know, an hour and a half or so just for a twenty minute workout.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um -- and a lotta times like a lotta people became really tired and what not afterwards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so that adds to the time.
R:  That's true.  That is true.  But eating does that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I know like sometimes after I'll eat lunch, depending on what you eat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so to speak, you know, it can really make you tired too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I'd probably rather get tired from exercise than, you know, anything else.
L:  I think so.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, what is it that you do?
R:  Um, I actually -- well, I haven't got one now, but I like mountain biking.  I think that's like a lotta fun.
L:  Good.
R:  And that's one of the things that, you know, I'd like to be able to do.  But we just moved out here and we're just trying to get settled in and, you know, money's a little on the tight side.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, we have all these things that we'd like to do like we enjoy canoeing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, and getting out on the water, but we do a lotta hiking and that's what's really cool around here 'cause we're like at the foothills of the Cascades.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's like there's really just a whole bunch of different terrain and everything else and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so it's really nice.  Actually hiking is probably one of my favorite things 'cause, you know, you can just see so many beautiful things just by taking a simple walk, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- through the forest so to speak and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and all these neat trails and [LIPSMACK] a lotta people are into that.  I mean, I'm from New England and a lotta people are into hiking up there too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
