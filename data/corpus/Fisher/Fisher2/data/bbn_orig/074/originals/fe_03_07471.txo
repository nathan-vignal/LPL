L:  Hi, I'm Benji.  [SIGH]
R:  I'm Amy.
L:  [MN]  Hi!  [LAUGH]
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  I think they're a bit out of date with the question.  [LAUGH]
R:  The what?
L:  [SIGH]  I think they're a bit out of date with the question.
R:  Yeah, I think so.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  What do you think about it?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, [SIGH] I mean are we supposed to talk about it in retrospect or what's [LAUGH] going on now?
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I think just -- I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Last time I got a call it was about food but --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- we -- I didn't really know it was going on then.  So, --
L:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I think --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know.  I think that ... they should help the people over there but, um, I don't think they should ... I don't know.  [LAUGH]  [PAUSE]  In Iraq [SIGH] ... but --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  They -- they, um, I'm worried about what ... a mess it might turn out to be if [LAUGH] this lasts much --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- longer in terms of [SIGH] no government, no sense of ... direction.
R:  Yeah.
L:  No sense of --
R:  There's just nothing over there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I seen something on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- TV that I think that it could have been solved a long time ago when Clinton was --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] in office.  But, um, they had him -- they had Osama Bin Laden in their sights --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything.  [SIGH]  They were just waiting for the o- okay from Clinton but, um, he was putting it off and wouldn't r- return their call.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And so I think the whole thing sho- -- would have been solved then, you know.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [PAUSE]  And then they [SIGH] -- I think that, [NOISE] um, the thing in Iraq -- I think that it might be [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] a personal thing with, [SIGH] um, President Bush, you know, 'cause of his dad.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  But [SIGH] ... I think ... t- they -- they should send more people over there to help 'em ... get in government and stuff.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  It -- it's so very unclear.  [NOISE]  I mean everything seemed to have [NOISE] -- okay, we have a plan as to [NOISE] [SIGH] how we're going to conduct the war [SIGH] but no plan as to w- what you're going to do when the war's over.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  A- a- and, um, I mean the fact that [MN] in Baghdad they still have, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] some very spotty power [NOISE] [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, well, um --
L:  -- and problems with water.  Let alone the outlying [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- and more desolate areas.  [LAUGH]
R:  People dying because they're [NOISE] -- you -- you know l- lack of food and water and stuff.  [NOISE]  And, [SIGH] um, I know the US is helping 'em but I don't think they're -- I think they need to do more.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  They need to [COUGH] send more people over there and ... guard -- like, all of their museums and stuff there --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- t- that people just stole stuff from.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And --
L:  Or the nuclear [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- waste that they stole from --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and now they've -- they've got children that are coming up with radiation burns [NOISE] and ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  Di- did you see the boot camp thing that they had the little kids, um -- um, Saddam had the little kids in there practising [NOISE] --
L:  No.  No.
R:  -- how to kill?
L:  I try not to watch much news coverage because we --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- have a five year old.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, we read a lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or listen on the radio but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if it's on TV --
R:  Like when the war first came out -- or when it first started they [SIGH] showed that on TV and [NOISE] I was like, "Wow!"  You know, these little [SIGH] five t- to ten year olds are out there, you know, shooting big old g- guns and everything and, ... [SIGH] ah, it's bad.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well and -- and the amount of, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, in essence, death camps that they had [LAUGH] --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- with the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mass grave sites.  [SIGH]  It's just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- terrifying and appalling and recent ones too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean it isn't just, "Oh, okay, well that was ... [SIGH] --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- twenty years ago".  It's, "Oh, that was right a week before you got here".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Y- yep, [PAUSE] but I -- I mean [COUGH] -- I don't know [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think -- I think it's good that they ... a- are helping the people but they need to figure some o- other plan out -- as to how, 'cause they don't have enough people to help.  We don't have enough people to go over there and help --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- is what.
L:  And I really don't get the sense that they know what -- w- w- what they really need to do.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  That there is -- there's a level of priorities and once you get past, [NOISE] um, [MN] a c- certain degree on the humanitarian scale that there's really just not -- doesn't seem to be that there's as much interest in it.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] so, like I said I don't w- watch m- much --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- news coverage because [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't want my daughter to see it.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, [MN] I don't know if you w- watch much more.  Are they -- is it still really t- talked about on the ... news --
R:  Um, --
L:  -- a lot?
R:  -- not -- not like it was.  It -- it is [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- every once in a while, like, [SIGH] [COUGH] 'cause people -- you know, the American soldiers are still getting, um, killed over there --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the suicide bombers are still there and everything.  So, [NOISE] um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- our people are still getting killed, ah, [NOISE] every day.  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, it was --
R:  And ... they haven't figured out if they [NOISE] got Osama ... Bin Laden or not.  [NOISE]  Or, ah, not -- Hussein -- Saddam Hussein.
L:  I was just hearing, a- ah, yesterday that -- that new strategy was in essence to, "Well we wait for them to fire at us.  [LAUGH]  We find out where they are and [LAUGH] --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- and then we get them".  [SIGH]  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's just, ah, horrifying situation and my [LAUGH] f- fear is not just for the Iraqi people and not just for our soldiers but, of course, what this [SIGH] ... d- does in the world --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- u- um, perspective of us.
R:  Yeah.  Well, then I -- I was scared when they first put -- started [NOISE] bombing over there.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I live -- I live -- it's not a small to- -- I -- I don't know it's, ah -- I live in Emporia, Kansas.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  So, it's like kind of medium sized I guess and, um, I was just scared, you know, [SIGH] that [NOISE] things would start happening over here, you know.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And, um, 'cause I grew up in a small town and my mom was -- she was all scared and everything.  She was, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "You live in a bigger town and there's more, ... um, [NOISE] you know, tourists".  And, um, well we have a lot of c- college people here a- and foreign exchange s- students [MN] and, ah, -- and my mom's like, "What if they, you know, decide to do something?" [LAUGH]  And [SIGH] so I'm like, "Yeah, I think it's okay".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But ...
L:  We're in Pittsburgh so ... we always figure that, you know, [LAUGH] um, Washington DC or New York is more likely to get it than us.  So, ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Did you ever go see any of that stuff [NOISE] when ... on September eleventh after that happened?
L:  [SIGH]  No.  My, um, -- my husband's from New York, --
R:  Oh, is he?
L:  -- [SIGH] a- and so he didn't know anybody that -- that -- well, he knew people that died, let's put it that way, but he wasn't, like, f- friends or relatives with --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- anybody that died.  [SIGH]  But he was, o- obviously much more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean I was distraught but h- he was really [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] but thankfully we were ... lucky that we didn't -- no, we didn't -- we didn't go there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or travel.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I mean, we knew people and actually I -- I had a [NOISE] student who was, like, [NOISE] right [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- t- there.  [SIGH]  Um, I mean not right a- at Ground Zero but, like, right there and trying to get out and just terrified.
R:  [NOISE]  Wow!
L:  And [SIGH] that was enough for us, [LAUGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- hearing a- about --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- it [LAUGH] from other people or reading about it in the newspaper.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  God.  [SIGH]
R:  It's scary.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's a -- I -- w- we're -- we went on [NOISE] vacation.  We were going to go to [NOISE] Florida but we ended up just going to Branston [SIGH] and I think a part of me didn't want to go to Florida because you -- you never know what happens.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, were you going to go to Disney?
R:  Do what?
L:  Disney.  Were you going to go to Disney?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause they shut down for a while.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, they did.  And then they --
L:  And then that would be a perfect target.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  And they had, like, um, [NOISE] no fly zones over, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, the whole place and everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's still in effect too.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Wow!  [NOISE]  It's scary.  'Cause, um --
L:  Over Disney I mean.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know what -- how -- I don't know any [NOISE] -- how anybody would want to kill theirself, you know, suicide bombing?  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't either.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Well, it's not so much the killing of themselves, it's the killing of [LAUGH] --
R:  They know that they're going to get [NOISE] --
L:  [SIGH]  Well, it's the killing of other people --
R:  -- lots of other people.
L:  -- that I don't ... really get.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Well, yeah.  That too but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That's -- that's the part --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that is [LAUGH] really beyond me the civilian, um, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- casualty --
R:  Target.
L:  -- target.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  It's crazy.
L:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, do you, u- um, f- follow this much or, um, is it --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- like a burnout thing [NOISE] or ...?  [SIGH]
R:  I did at first but now I'm just -- 'cause I had a [COUGH] [LIPSMACK] -- my baby's five months old --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and so I had a lot of time just to sit around and do nothing.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And so I just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- watched the ... w- war and everything.  [PAUSE]  [NOISE]  Whenever he was small but now he -- he's five months so [NOISE] it's time to go do stuff and --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  -- get out.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's -- that's a fun time too.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Once they actually start to like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- n- not just -- I mean, lay there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  And recognize, "Oh, look at that" [LAUGH] you know, o- o- oh!  [LAUGH]
R:  And he was born in January too so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was h- hard, you know, to -- I didn't want to get him sick and, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, I know RSV is p- pretty common in the wintertime with babies.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  That -- whatever -- the lung thing but [NOISE] [PAUSE]--  and then th- this war -- all these, um, [LAUGH] different kind of diseases that are coming out.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's so scary.
R:  Like SARs and Monkey Pox and [SIGH] I don't know -- I don't know [NOISE] much about the Monkey Pox but, [NOISE] [SIGH] um, the SARs scared me.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, and, ah, it all scares me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Um ...
R:  Well, there was [NOISE] somebody here, [SIGH] like -- well in Joplin, Missouri it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- like, um, [SIGH] four or five hours away from here that a -- they -- these people are quarantining [NOISE] theirselves in -- in their houses [NOISE] because they think that they [NOISE] -- they will having symptoms of it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Of w- what, SARs or the Monk- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
