R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  [LAUGH]  My name is Emily.
R:  Emily.  My name is Chancey.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  So, the topic of the day -- personal habits.  What is worse?  Um, I would definitely have to say possibly gossiping.
R:  Gossiping?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I didn't -- I'm not sure if I caught all of the, uh, uh -- the items.  Was it smoking, drinking?
L:  Yeah.  Caffeine and gossiping and I think there were two more and I missed the other two as well.  But I -- oh, exercise, not exercising was one of 'em and I missed the other one.
R:  Okay.
L:  And I would suppose ...
R:  Um, I think, uh, smoking is -- is pretty high on my life for, uh, being the worst.
L:  Well, yeah, actually I do admit that actually is probably my biggest pet peeve is smoking.  So, I -- I guess I don't tend to think about it because I haven't been around anyone that smoked in probably about six years.  I guess ...
R:  How lucky for you.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I guess I just don't even think about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Now, as -- as for a healthy, uh, uh -- I guess, uh, what was it, overeating was one of the other things?
L:  Oh, that could've been the other one.  That's very possible.  Overeating I think that's kind of a hard one because I would like to say I'm an overeater, but I don't look at -- I, um -- when I'm not pregnant I only weigh about a hundred and five pounds no matter how much I eat.  So, I guess it depends on the person.
R:  Right.  You must have one of those very high metabolisms.
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I do.  I actually, um -- when I'm not pregnant I'm about thirteen pounds underweight and so [LAUGH] -- so no matter what I eat ...  So, yeah, actually I would agree with you.  Smoking probably is one of the biggest and, depending on how old you are, drinking may or may not be, whether it's moderate or excessive.  That's not necessarily -- doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it, uh -- it -- I guess they're talking about in excess --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, because that's some -- some studies say that, uh, if you have, what, one or two drinks of wine a day --
L:  That it's actually good for you.
R:  -- that's -- in moderation it's good for you.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is a good point.  I guess prob- probably gossiping would be the -- the least deadly of all of 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, um ...
R:  Yeah.  The least deadly, but it's probably -- it stirs up quite a bit of, uh -- just -- I don't know what.
L:  Controversy, depending on who it's about.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't like really talking or gossiping about anybody or any- -- you know, if it's not -- if it's not a fact I don't wanna hear about it.
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  That's a good point.  I just came from an office about a year ago that that's all they did and that's why I left and so that's like a huge pet peeve for me.  [LAUGH]  So, I never worked in an atmosphere like that before.  So, it was kind of strange for me.  Now the coffee -- the, uh, caffeine, I'll admit I'm guilty of that.  I'd just die not having ca- caffeine and so [LAUGH] I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing, but ...
R:  And how do you consume most of your caffeine -- Cola, tea, um, coffee?
L:  Um, when I used to be -- when I used to be able to drink caffeine it was coffee --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so it kills me every time I make a pot of coffee for my fiancee I just smell it and I just have to fight the urge to have a cup.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I've done really well.  But normally, yes, it would be coffee.
R:  Okay.  I have tea occasionally.
L:  Tea occasionally?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, that's not necessarily so bad.  Not necessarily so bad at all.  I just never really realized how addicting caffeine or coffee can be until I couldn't have it anymore.
R:  Right.  And a lotta ...
L:  I'm already ...
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Yeah.  I'm already -- I'm already in my seventh month and it still gets me every single day.  I just wish I could have a cup.
R:  [MN]
L:  But ...
R:  Do you know -- do you know if it's a boy or girl?
L:  Um, twins, both girls.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Congratulations.
L:  Thank you very much.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, what other, uh, habits are -- are you, uh, restricted from or -- or what not?
L:  You know, just about -- I'm restricted from just about everything on this list.  I can't have caffeine.  I can't obviously smoke.  I mean, I never have.  Um, can't drink, um, can't over- -- can't -- well, I guess I could under exercise because I'm supposed to be on moderate activities.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  You shouldn't overeat either I'd imagine.
L:  Yeah.  No, probably shouldn't overeat either.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, yeah, gossiping would be the safest one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, for me it would be.
R:  Especially in your case.
L:  Yep.  It would be.  And what ya think is probably the hardest thing for you of personal -- of these habits?
R:  Um, well, uh, unless there was one that we missed --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- r- really none of them because I -- I don't drink.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't smoke.  Um, I'm very -- you know, very thin.  I mean, for me to overeat is, uh -- I'd have to be -- you know, just go to a buffet probably three times a day --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, uh, I mean, I just -- you know, um, I -- I don't -- I don't do too much of anything in excess.  So --
L: Well, that's good.
R:  -- I -- I watch those things.
L:  What do you think is probably the most dangerous for people in general?
R:  Um, probably overeating and, uh, smoking and drink- -- I'd probably -- number one probably overeating.  Number two --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- drinking and then smoking.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so weird.  I just never think of the smoking one.  I -- the city I -- I guess it's a town -- the town I live in even has a thing where you can't smoke, um, outside downtown and the strangest one is you can't smoke in the bars here.  So, it's pretty much a smoke free town and so I guess that's a good thing.  But I would definitely have to say that yeah, smoking is right up there.  Is -- it is right up there and I don't really know a lotta people that, um, you know, drinking excessively.  But, uh, that can be dangerous not only for yourself but for anybody else if you're getting behind the wheel.
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  And it's really scary.
R:  Isn't smoking outlawed in any outdoor building where you live -- I mean indoor building?  Excuse me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, indoor.  Yes.
R:  Inside.
L:  Yes.  Indoor it is, but outdoor downtown it is as well.  So, if you work downtown you can't even step outside to have a smoke.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really strange.  I don't mind it, but [LAUGH] I'm sure it's kind of difficult for those who do smoke.  And so I for one -- an interesting thing that I learned when I moved here.
R:  And what beautiful state is that?
L:  I live in Oregon.
R:  Oregon?
L:  I live in Corvallis, Oregon.
R:  Okay.  I'm in California.
L:  Oh, okay.  The last person I did a call with was in California as well.
R:  Mhm.  Well, uh, I have the T.V. on and they just lit up a cigarette on -- on -- on that show.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know, do you watch the Simpsons?
R:  Sometimes.
L:  I think it's really odd that a lotta times, and I realize it's an adult cartoon, but -- and I love the Simpsons -- but there's always like cartoon people on there smoking and I just found that very, very odd.
R:  And there's definitely plenty of gossiping.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, there's plenty of gossiping on there too.  Homer overeating and drinking.  Yep.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Um, yeah, that's kinda funny now that I think about it that I said go- gossiping was probably the worst of all of 'em because it's probably, um, the one with least problems that can be caused physically I think.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Too much caffeine could definitely be detri- detrimental to your system, um, 'cause if you've been -- as I've learned being pregnant that it blocks the intake of your calcium or, um -- you still intake calcium, but it doesn't actually bond with you and smoking obviously has serious side effects with lung cancer, and drinking and -- and under exercising too.
R:  Definitely.  So, would you say the, uh -- the -- the majority of the people at your work, uh, have, uh, the similar problems with the -- with these?
L:  With the gossiping?
R:  Well, I -- I mean, w- --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- with -- with any of these habits which would you say are -- are the worst for those in- individuals?
L:  Okay.  Well, let's see, um, I would say that probably most of them are overweight.  So, I assume maybe they are probably overeaters.  Of course, I can't -- I don't go to dinner with them.  So, I'm not a hundred percent sure of that.  Um, only of 'em smokes and I really don't know that any of 'em even go out for drinks.
R:  Ah.
L:  But there's a lot of go- gossiping in the office.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I guess that's pretty much the one safest thing that everybody can do.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  That is a good point.  And how 'bout where you are?  I don't know if you work or ...
R:  Yes.  I'm, uh, working in real estate --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, uh, a lotta the different people, uh, in the real estate office are -- there are a few that are overweight but, I mean, uh, I'm not around them enough to know about their -- their smoking habits or, uh, drinking habits.  I don't go out afterwards, uh, to the bar, tavern, or what -- what not with them.
L:  With them.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  Right.
R:  And, uh, I mean, gossiping is just prolific everywhere, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
