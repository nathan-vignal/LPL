L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Ah, my name's Debbie[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Berlandi[?]. [MN] Mm. [LAUGH] Okay, our topic is, um, personal habits.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay. [MN]
R:  Well, I guess, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- I guess the exercising --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- part I -- I guess I didn't quite understand what -- what the -- what that recording [LAUGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was talking about.
L:  It's -- it's --
R:  I was sitting here playing on my computer, but ...
L:  Oh, it said, "Which was in worse --"
R:  Which is worse?
L:  "-- gossiping, smoking, drinking, eating excessively and not exercising?".
R:  Probably not exercising. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Because I like to exercise.
L:  Well, [SIGH] I would say [SIGH] um, smoking.
R:  Yeah, well I don't --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  Yeah, I don't smoke.
L:  Yeah, it's one of my things I really, really think is real bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but they all fall in its own category.  Everything you don't do [LAUGH] is bad for you, everything you have too much of is bad for you, so.
R: Yeah, that's true.
L:  Mhm. [MN] Excuse me, but gossiping also, I think, is not a good thing. [LAUGH]
R:  No, it's not.  I've -- I've -- that- -- that's why I try -- kind of stay to [several inaudible words] stay to myself because I don't -- I don't like gossiping, I just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- play a- -- kind of play around with the computer and -- and just, kind of, keep myself busy.
L:  Mm. [MN] But it's kind of hard because when you're around people, like where I work --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody [several inaudible words], "Did you hear? Blah, blah, blah.  Did you hear? Blah" and you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- everybody has something to say.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And you gotta just -- you, kind of, either gotta walk away or [NOISE] just, kind of, you know, smile and keep going.
R:  Yeah and just --
L:  But you know.
R:  Yeah, just -- just let it go through one ear and out the other. [LAUGH]
L:  Yup.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And, um, let's see what they were saying, um --
R:  About the smoking?
L:  -- yeah, drinking I think is also --
R:  Drinking, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I --
L:  I mean --
R:  I -- you know, we have a drink once in a while but I mean, we're not alcoholics or anything like that.  I mean, excessive drinking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't -- I don't like to do, but ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH] But you know --
L:  That's the thing, you have people who are social drinkers but drinking becomes really bad when, um, you know, somebody decides to drink and drive or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you're in -- ah, in public and you're an embarassment, [MN] you know?
R:  Yeah, I don't -- no, I definitely -- against the drinking and diving.  Like I say, having a drink somewhere and have somebody drive you if you've had a few drinks, but [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you know [NOISE] I don't want to put anybody in danger of [NOISE] -- of me behind the wheel drinking, for sure.
L:  It always seems to be that the person who's drunk is not the --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- one that gets hurt.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's always the other person.
R:  [NOISE] That's true.
L:  Yeah, so [several inaudible words].
R:  And I know my dad [NOISE] was in a bad car wreck [NOISE] and that -- they thought he was dead and when they -- it -- ah, had to [NOISE] life flight him somewhere but got -- got him to the hospital and he was just a drunk, he was out of it, [NOISE] and like I say, he didn't get hurt because he was -- he was really drunk. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And did- -- and didn't feel anything, so.
L:  Yes, that always seems to happen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think that's ridiculous.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Yeah, it really is and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like I say, the smoking part I've -- I've never picked up that habit, so.
L:  Me neither.  It's something I truly don't like at all anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- it is -- I think it's just, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's -- it's your choice if you decide you want to smoke, but don't put me in the middle of it.  Don't smoke in front in front of me.  Don't smoke, you know, in -- in my -- the -- my path of breathing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  Even in people who drive in the street, I've seen that too.  They drive down the street and they're smoking and when they puff it, they puff it out --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and that puffs right into my car or it puffs right into my -- you know, my window.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I despise that.
R:  Yeah, I'm kind of glad they've banned some of those restaurants from smoking.
L:  Oh, yeah.  But they're still -- you know what happens when people -- in the ones that are banned, [MN] people seem to smoke by the doorway anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.
L:  Mhm.  And so --
R:  So, they're gonna -- they're gonna smoke one way or the other, I guess.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE] And we have to breathe it in.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  And as far as exercising goes, I -- I like to try to, you know, keep -- keep myself busy exercising or just, you know -- just -- because I like to -- I like to -- well, we've got a basement here and I got some equipment, I like to get down there on and exercise, but I really think that's a good thing for people not getting over- -- getting too overweight.
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Me -- I --
R:  My -- my hubby's a little overweight but [LAUGH] -- but he don't exercise like I do.
L:  Oh and he doesn't want to exercise with you?
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  No, I ask him to walk with me, he said, "No, I'm not going to walk anywhere, not unless I have to" so.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, being overweight is a reason to walk. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that's true --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what I've tried to tell em.
L:  Mm.
R:  But it don't do any good. [LAUGH]
L:  That's the same here with me, I'm trying to drop some weight and I -- I -- that's what I'm doing everyday is walking, walking, walking --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and trying to drink a lot of water. [MN] Mhm.
R:  Mm.  Yeah, I've got me one of those elliptical gliders and I -- I usually pedal that at least fifteen minutes a day and that -- that really, you know --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- keeps the weight off.
L:  Mm.  Is it a good machine?
R:  Huh?
L:  Is it a good machine?
R:  Yeah, it's a good machine.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  But um, like I say, I don't -- I -- I'm kind of a -- a small person anyway, I don't need to lose too much, that's what my husband keeps saying, but it just makes me feel good to exercise --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- that- that's mainly a reason I do it.
L:  Yeah, stay healthy?
R:  Yeah, stay healthy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and I've got four s- -- ah, well three sisters and a brother and I'm -- I -- ah, well, I'm one of the -- next to the oldest and I -- I really look younger than -- than all five of em.  I guess it's because of me, you know, keeping -- keeping my health and, you know, keeping the exercise up.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I think it's a good thing.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  And the overeating, [MN] which is al- -- that's also a bad thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, but I think out of all of them I would chose [LAUGH] -- for me would be smoking. [LAUGH] That's my worst. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that would be the worst, but ...
R:  Yeah, probably for me too, I --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- because I don't like being around people that smoke and my husband, he smoked for years but he finally -- he quit [inaudible] -- five years ago and he hadn't picked up another cigarette, so.
L:  Oh, that's good. [MN] That's real good.
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it's -- I -- I was trying to think of what of the other -- some of the other --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- bad habits they said.  I know the drinking and smoking and --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- not exercising.  I guess being overweight.
L:  Mhm.  [several inaudible words] overeating --
R:  Overeating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, as far as overeating goes, if you keep the stuff out of your kitchen, you won't overeat. [LAUGH]
L:  That's true. [MN]
R:  That's what I tell my sister.  I --
L:  Because if it's not there to grab, you're not going to grab it.
R:  That's right.
L:  Mm.
R:  Keep your fruits and vegetables in front of you and -- and you'll drop that weight.
L:  Mhm.  And that's -- I've started -- [several inaudible words] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I've started, um, juicing things.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah and making different kinds of shakes [MN] out of fruits and vegetables and stuff --
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  -- yeah, just -- just to, you know -- to create some kind of snack --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- away from those sugary things.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But [MN] --
R:  Well, that's a good idea.
L:  Mhm.  And I think people don't realise that they're -- they're overeating because [SIGH] you know, some- sometimes they say, either you eat three meals a day or you eat six small meals a day, but sometimes when you -- you know, you're snacking here or snacking there or snacking there, that's -- that causes you to overeat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because everything you stick in your mouth is going to, you know --
R:  And boy, my mother in law she is -- she's a great cook.  She -- she cooks this old fashioned food that's got all kinds [LAUGH] of fat and sugar in it but --
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  -- it -- it's tempting, I tell you. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, boy.  But she if you eat that one time, then you know you've gotta go work out again. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, I know it and that's it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  That's exactly right.
L:  Mm.
R:  But ah, like I say --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- them -- them fruit shakes that you is talking about, that -- you know, that sounds good.  I've -- I've never -- I -- I usually just eat strawberries, just plain strawberries and stuff but --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it sounds good to put em in a blender or something and just --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- drink em like a strawberry shake or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm. [MN] I started doing that because I -- I -- I used to get sweet cravings --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [MN] I didn't want to eat, like, the cookies and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- and, ah, this guy [NOISE] he's a real juice freak --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- he [LAUGH] -- he told me, "Just start juicing -- juicing your fruit.  You like strawberries, [several inaudible words] strawberry and apple, you know, put a little milk.  You -- you want protein, get a little protein shake mixed together" you know?
R:  Well, I tell you what, if you boil eggs and eat cheddar cheese, just little -- you know, little snacks like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that takes the hunger away pretty quick for me.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And like I say, and that's -- and that gives ya a lot of protein too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But I just -- and some of those little wheat and cheddar crackers.  It's -- you know, it's a little fattening but it -- it takes the craving away for me real quick.
L:  Oh.  Wheat is always good -- not -- not too-- too excessive but you know, it's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Mhm.
R:  So, um -- but other --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- than that I -- just high protein, low fat.  It --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it works.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Okay, is there any other habits that you think are pretty
