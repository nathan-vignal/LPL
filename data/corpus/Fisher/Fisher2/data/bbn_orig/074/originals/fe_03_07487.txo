L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, this is Heather.  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, this is Christine.  [SIGH]
L:  Hi, Christine, how are you?  [NOISE]
R:  Good.  [NOISE]
L:  Good!
R:  [SIGH]  How are you doing?  [SIGH]
L:  G- good.  I've only done one of these before.  How about you?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Um, this is t- the third one for me.  [SIGH]
L:  O- oh, so this is your last one, isn't it?  [SIGH]
R:  It is.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Well, anyway, let's, ah, --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [NOISE] get --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- to talking.  What's -- what's your favorite holiday?  [SIGH]
R:  U- um, you know, it alternates between Thanksgiving --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and Christmas because --
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  -- that's when my brother gets h- home.  [SIGH]  So, ...
L:  Oh, where is he?  [SIGH]
R:  H- he's in, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Mathews Park in Colorado [SIGH] so --
L:  O- o- oh, --
R:  -- he told [SIGH] --
L:  -- that's gorgeous out there.  [SIGH]
R:  It really is.  I was just up there.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  So, it depends on whichever one he comes home that's when ... the whole family is together, like, extended and ... everything.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, that's awesome.
R:  So, [SIGH] yeah, that's really [SIGH] --
L:  Is that, like, the only time you all get together?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, the entire family.  Yeah, it [SIGH] is.
L:  Oh, that's c- cool.
R:  It's one holiday or the other.  [SIGH]  So, he alternates with his, [SIGH] um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] wife's family the other h- holiday, so [SIGH] you know, if it's Thanksgiving with us, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Christmas with them.  If it's Christmas with us, it's Thanksgiving with them.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE]  So, ...  [SIGH]
L:  Well, that's very cool.  I've got to say mine is Christmas, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- hands down.  [SIGH]  I'm a --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, definitely.  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, I'm a big freak about Christmas.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I absolutely love it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Um, I [MN] love buying the presents.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I love wrapping 'em.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I love bringing them.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I love ... going to church.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I love [SIGH] just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everything about the whole holiday.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Except, of course, if it's --
R:  I [NOISE] --
L:  -- icy and gross, 'cause I'm in Chicago --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but, ah, you know.
R:  O- o- oh, [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- well I'm actually originally from Boston and I actually --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- love snow.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That's even w- worse --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- f- for snow --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at least.  I -- I was born out there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so ...
R:  Okay.  Yeah, I --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- l- love the snow.  [NOISE]
L:  Where are you now?
R:  [NOISE]  I'm in DC.  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh, okay.  So, you still get --
R:  I don't get so much snow now.
L:  -- some but ... n- not a whole lot.
R:  And we actually got a l- lot this year but it's absolutely rare.  [SIGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  S- so, I'm --
L:  Well, if you could create a holiday --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what would it be and w- why?  [NOISE]
R:  You know, I don't know, that's really t- tough.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  I don't have -- I mean [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't know.  [SIGH]
L:  Well, you know, I think --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they've all pretty much been created and I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- m- my second best would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my birthday.  So, if I could create a holiday for [SIGH] everyone else --
R:  For just your --
L:  -- to celebrate, --
R:  -- birthday?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [SIGH] it would be my b- birthday.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, ah, yeah, I'm a big freak about my birthday.  Ask my husband, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he's in the next room.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, ah, I am -- I'm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I j- just love it.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You're -- you're p- princess for a day and, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] um, I like to actually stretch it out to be my birth month.  [SIGH]  But ah, --
R:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so when April thirteenth comes around you can say, "That gal that I talked to" [SIGH] yeah --
R:  That's my sister's birthday!  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  What is it?
R:  That's -- April thirteenth is my sister's birthday.
L:  Oh, really?  Is she a --
R:  So, I celebrate your birthday.  [SIGH]
L:  -- is she a big weirdo too?
R:  Um, [SIGH] not really, she's --
L:  Oh, I love -- and I'm --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- thirty three --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you'd think I'd be over it already but --
R:  Oh, that's funny.  [SIGH]
L:  -- I don't think I ever will.
R:  Yeah, m- -- in my family, um, [MN] birthdays --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all basically happen at the same time as e- either Thanksgiving or Christmas because [SIGH] s- since we don't really get to see each other, rather than [SIGH] s- shipping --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- things and -- [SIGH] it's all sort of, you know, whenever --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- we catch up with each one.  So, it's never really on the day.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, that's a good idea though --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to do it that way.
R:  Except for my sister -- my other sister, whose birthday is the twenty third of November.  So, [SIGH] every few years her birthday actually f- falls on Thanksgiving.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, neat!
R:  So, we, um, -- [SIGH] so she'll actually h- have her real birthday on the day that we all get together.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's very cool.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I've had mine fall on Easter --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and it'd kind of be the same thing, but [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my -- my folks aren't far from us.  They're ... just in South Bend, Indiana, so it's just a couple of hours.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, we typically still get together for birthdays [SIGH] as much as we can.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, family is starting to move away and stuff now.  So, [MN] it's not going to be the same --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as it always has been.  But n- now I've got, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, [SIGH] a niece and some nephews.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- theirs are, kind of, taking over as, you know, the more p- prevalent b- birthdays.  If we have to mi- --
R:  Well, of course.  [NOISE]
L:  -- yeah, you know, if we have to miss an adult's birthday ... you know, we have to but, [SIGH] you know, you n- never miss the kids, --
R:  Right.  [SIGH]
L:  -- never ever, 'cause they're just awesome.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah --
L:  So, ...
R:  -- my nephew, um, I actually -- I missed h- his birthday this year, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, so I had to call him [SIGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- which I did.  [inaudible]
L:  [SIGH]  How old is he?
R:  He's eight.  [SIGH]
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  So, it was very exciting to get -- you know, a phone call on his birthday and --
L:  Oh, yeah, --
R:  -- but my --
L:  -- 'cause nobody ever calls for t- them at that age, you know.
R:  Right.  Right.  So, it --
L:  That's so c- cute.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- was very cool.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Are you on a cellphone by the way?
R:  I am.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  It's seems, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we were cutting every now and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- again.  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'll try not to interrupt you if you're talking 'cause --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] then we -- we kind of cut in and out.  So, sorry about that.  [NOISE]
R:  No, that's [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not a problem.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  You're, like, whatever.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah, I -- you know, that's -- you know, I l- live off my cellphone unfortunately.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, do you -- do you not have a home phone?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, actually not right now 'cause I'm m- moving from, um, [SIGH] the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- n- northern part of DC --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on the Baltimore line to the --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- southern part of DC and the ... Virginia line.  So, ...
L:  [MN]  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  I'm [SIGH] -- so in the process of --
L:  My husband actually went to grad school out, um, [NOISE] in Virginia at William and Mary.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yes.  Okay.  [SIGH]
L:  And he just absolutely loves that w- whole --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- area.  He keeps telling me we're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to go out to DC some day and [NOISE] [SIGH] -- and --
R:  Oh, you've never been?
L:  I've never been.  N- no.
R:  Oh, you h- have to be here.
L:  I know.  I'd love it and he's so into politics --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stuff too that would be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I would get so much excitement t- through him.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yep.  [NOISE]
L:  Because he just loves it all so much and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] so, um, I couldn't think of anybody else I'd really want to go there w- with --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just because --
R:  And it's not just that because I'm in the military so, --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I mean it's kind of funny 'cause we're talking about the holidays and it's, like, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well I have my mil- -- I have a +holiday, you know, for being in the military and [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- you know, all that so it's kind of already there but the m- military aspect and [SIGH] -- and just a whole h- historical side of it and, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the monuments are gorgeous --
L:  R- right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [SIGH] it's just [SIGH] -- it's a whole different atmosphere.  People are really nice.  And I don't know how people a- are in Chicago --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I know in Boston it's, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, head down, [SIGH] you're busy --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- and you're in the city and you have to go and --
L:  Y- y- yeah, --
R:  -- there's no --
L:  -- in the city it's like that.
R:  But in DC --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's heads up -- I mean it's a city --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everybody's got their h- head up and, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, they say, "Hello!" and --
L:  Really?
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's a- amazing.
L:  [NOISE]  That is really surprising to me.
R:  It's r- really amazing.
L:  [NOISE]  Huh!
R:  I mean you certainly have your business people who are, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in conversation or whatever.  But, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, you generally -- I mean I've had people, you know, I'll ... have -- just walking around and, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, kind of -- still doing the touristy thing and --
L:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] other people say, "Are you lost?  Do you --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- do you know where you're going?"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "Can I help you?"  [SIGH]
L:  [MN]  Wow!
R:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  That is really --
R:  That's pretty amazing.
L:  -- nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  I like that.
R:  I love it.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I would like to go for the h- historical reasons and stuff too.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um, [NOISE] I could l- live the political --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- through him, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  And he'd probably live --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some of the h- historical through me 'cause I love doing, like, the h- house tours and, [SIGH] you know, I don't know --
R:  Yeah, and the --
L:  -- silly things like that.  [NOISE]
R:  -- Smithsonian.  I mean, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- all the museums are free.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  Are they really?  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All free.
L:  Is parking too?  [SIGH]
R:  U- um, [SIGH] parking if you can get it.  But the easiest thing to do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is, you know, e- either, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, depending --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on how you ... g- get here, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- um, if you fly in you don't even have to rent a car --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you just fly into Dallas and take the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yellow line in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stay wherever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're going to stay in town, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and every thing is on the metro.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Every -- you can get everywhere -- you don't -- you don't need a car.  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  You should work for the Tourism Board.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, no kidding!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I'm telling you, you'd do a bonus or something --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- for them that's sure.
R:  Yeah, it's kind of funny but, --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- yeah, well -- [SIGH] yeah, I mean it's -- it really you don't -- you don't need a car unless you want to go outside of the city.  [SIGH]
L:  No, I totally want to go.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, you should.
L:  My husband and I were just talking about taking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a getaway for our anniversary that's coming up this ... w- weekend.  So, ... [SIGH]
R:  It's a great four day trip.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  You know, you can do a long weekend out here and it's -- like I said you fly into Dallas.  You can usually get like, [SIGH] you know, some sort of hotel ... plane deal, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, a package deal.  And, like I said, you fly into either Dallas o- or -- actually, Dallas is on the orange line and R- Regan's on the yellow line, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [SIGH] you just j- jump on the line and come into town and [SIGH] --
L:  Is it hot enough though yet?  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, my --
L:  Because I -- you know what, I'm really --
R:  -- goodness it was eighty --
L:  -- I'm really driven by weather.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I want -- I want to take a trip where I can lay out -- like, a day or two at least.  [SIGH]
R:  It's been ... in the nineties.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh, is it muggy too though?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [SIGH] it hasn't this week but ... you know, give it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a few more weeks and t- the thunder storms will ... m- move out and, you know, right now it's like the -- [SIGH] like it's just gone from c- cold to hot so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all the weather is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is kicked up and [SIGH] the thunderstorms are h- -- are starting.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But in another w- week they'll be gone and [SIGH] it'll be, you know, a normal summer.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, wow!   [SIGH]  Eee, now I have to go.
R:  Yeah, and -- well the other --
L:  I ju- --
R:  -- time if you want to put it off is, ah, during the cherry blossoms --
L:  When -- when is that?  [SIGH]
R:  That's in April.
L:  O- oh!
R:  That's, you know, if you're going to do a year away.  [SIGH]
L:  O- oh, that would be so n- nice.  I --
R:  It's r- really, really a nice time.
L:  And we could do like --
R:  And you can go --
L:  -- a time share out there too 'cause we have timeshare time.  So, I'm sure there's p- plenty of 'em out there in --
R:  Oh, my God, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- the historical village and stuff like that.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, that would be so cool.
R:  So, you could --
L:  So, we kind of got off the holiday thing, though.  I wonder if they're going to bust us for that?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I --
R:  Yeah, we kind of did, didn't we?  [SIGH]
L:  -- I doubt it.  I think they just want to kind of give you a jumping off point.  I'm hoping that's [LAUGH] t- the case.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- it's -- you know, it's not an easy topic.  [SIGH]
L:  No, it's n- not.  In fact, you know, it's funny they give a -- they gave me --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- oh, what was it they gave me?  Um, [LIPSMACK] t- terrorism, [SIGH] of all things, [SIGH] --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- last year.  [SIGH]  At the end of the year I think it was, like, when they were telling us to go out and buy, [SIGH] ... um, duck tape and -- and plastic --
