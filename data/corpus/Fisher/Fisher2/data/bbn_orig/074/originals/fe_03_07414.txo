L:  Hello, my name is Tracey[?].  I'm thirty two.  Engaged and I'm from Saint Louis, Missouri.
R:  Hi, I'm Jill[?].  I'm twenty seven.  Just barely married and from Champagne, Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.  I guess we can start talking now.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm sorry. [LAUGH] This -- it's kind of weird.  I've only done this like three times, but I guess the worst habit that I have is smoking.  I smoke way too much and I'm trying to quit --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's a nasty bad habit of mine and I al- -- I'm almost like a closet smoker --
R:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, because people at work are like, "Oh, my God.  You smoke?" and I'm like, "Yeah".  Every once in awhile they'll catch me smoking at work --
R:  So, you --
L:  -- so.
R:  -- do you like hid behind the building or something --
L:  No.
R:  -- if you go out for a smoke break?
L:  No, I just, um -- well, because I work in a restaurant --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and so I think that it's really nasty to be smoking and, you know, serving food --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and so I really try really hard not to smoke at work but when it -- we get really busy, like on Friday and Saturday nights, every once in awhile I'll sneak out and have me a smoke.  So, I think that's -- that's just a horrible habit that kills too many people, you know, yearly and it's so expensive to smoke.  It's just a horrible habit to have.  I say the best way to quit smoking is to never start.
R:  Yeah, that -- that's what people typically say.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm trying to think.  I think I probably -- yeah, definitely my worst habit, at least out of their list, is overeating. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  I like eating way too much and I'm not very good about, you know, deciding that I've had enough.  There's no such things as being full, in my eyes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just like to eat constantly, so.  It's -- [inaudible] --
L:  Yeah, I go- -- I've kind of -- ah, as I've gotten a little older, I've gotten better, um, about my eating habits, because I actually, ah, started a dinner club about -- I guess it's been going on now for a little o- over a year, about a year and a half now, so we go out like once a month and oh my God, we order so much food --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's almost disgusting.
R:  Sounds fun.
L:  [LAUGH] It is a lot of fun.  I mean, it's -- it's a lot of fun, but we order so much food and then when we get the bill we're like, "Oh, my goodness.  I can't believe we ordered this much food".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And I know, um, a lot of, um -- I've worked in the restaurant industry on and off like ever since I've started working, and, um, a lot of chefs, I didn't know they did this and I'm so excited about it, I want me and my fiance to start doing this, they go on like taste tests.  They'll go to like all these nice restaurants -- they travel a lot, they'll go to all these nice restaurants, order like ten things on the menu that they really like and just like taste em, you know?  They don't eat the whole --
R:  They just --
L:  -- the whole thing, they just taste em, so that they can like come back to their restaurant and try to like reproduce, you know, something that they had somewhere that tasted really good --
R:  Well, that sounds totally fun.
L:  -- so I want to start doing that.  Yeah, that's what I think too.
R:  So, do you do some cooking, in the --
L:  Um --
R:  -- in the restaurant?
L:  No, no, no, no.  I am a server.  I -- I just wait tables, that's all.
R:  You should get them to -- to let you start doing, ah, tastings --
L:  I would like to.
R:  -- tours, that would be so fun.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd like to, but I don't know, I think tha- -- well, at least for me now, I need the cash, so the cash is, you know, waiting tables.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it- -- it's just more convenient for me to -- because I have a lot of free time, um, except for on the weekends, that's when, you know, you're really, really busy but --
R:  It's a busy time.
L:  -- I have a lot of free time, because actually me and my fiance are trying to open up a [NOISE] -- a pizza restaurant.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, um, we just -- actually closed on a building, Monday.  So, we're excited about that.  So, food is a big part of our lives --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- definitely.  Um, I actually cooked some, ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- tortellini and some really good sauce tonight --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so that's what we had for dinner.
R:  Yeah, I can't cook which is kind of unfortunate --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I try a lot but I'm -- I'm just not good at it at all and when I do cook my husband just tries to be nice, but he usually, you know, wishes he had cooked --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- because it's not very good. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, practice, practice, practice is what I always say --
R:  Yeah, I think that's probably true.
L:  -- that's the only the way.  Yeah, that's the only way you can get good at it.  I mess a lot of things up, but I don't care.  Um, we were trying to create like our own pizza, ah, sauce recipe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, I had never done it before so I asked a couple of chefs at work, you know, what I should do and just, you know, from me remembering what they said, they said, you know, "Tomatoes and fresh herbs" and so I made it and it tasted good but it looked weird.  It was -- um, it looked orange, very orange --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- instead of really red.  And so when I went back to work I'm like, you know, it tasted fine, I mean it wasn't the best --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it was my first time and then like you just have to keep practicing.  You practice until you get it down to where you really like it and you enjoy it.  And then I think a lot of times, ah, a big problem with people and cooking is they're so impatient, you know?
R:  Yes.
L:  Because I -- a lot of people cook when they're hungry and so they want it done like right now and a lot of times it just takes time for it -- you know, I had to let, ah, the sauce I did today -- the recipe said, "Simmer for like two and a half hours".  I'm like, "Yeah, right" --
R:  Yeah, that's forever.
L:  -- but I let it simmer for like -- yeah, I let it simmer for like an hour and a half --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  -- I mean, you just do other stuff.
R:  Yeah, that's --
L:  Because food is a big part of my life too.
R:  It's a big problem for me, I -- if I come home at the end of the day, I'm hungry --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so e- -- I jus- -- I can't even concentrate on cooking.  I'll just go in the fridge and get whatever's easy.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  You know?  Half the time, just make a sandwich --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it's easier than cooking.
L:  Yeah, we, um --
R:  But --
L:  -- we work late, you know, since we work in the restaurant industry --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and so we eat at like, one and two o'clock in the morning which is really bad.  Oh, that's horrible.  But I don't get off sometimes until like one thirty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm starving because I've been -- you know, we've just been so busy at the restaurant and so I'm starving and by the time I get home, um --
R:  Yeah and you're looking at everybody else's food the whole time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- wishing you could eat it.
L:  It's so like ironic, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's really weird to have to serve people all night long, but you can't eat yourself.
R:  Yeah, that would be kind of a pain.
L:  Uh-huh.  It is.  We always complain about it.  I'm like, "This is some bizarre jedi mind trick".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it really is, but I -- I [inaudible] --
R:  Do you ever get to -- I've always wondered that, you -- you can't sneak into the kitchen and eat in the middle, is it just too busy or --
L:  Well, you can --
R:  -- do they not let you?
L:  -- you can, but you're like scoffing it down so fast.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Oh, it's -- I mean, you just do not have the time, um, because the dinner rush can just -- it can last from like seven o'clock until like eleven o'clock --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so you just don't have the time and then by t- -- by eleven o'clock you're trying to get out of there.  You're trying to clean up --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so you can go home.  So, it's -- it's really weird.  It's really, really weird, but I've -- lately -- I don't know if you have cable, but um, I've been watching a lot of like the food network?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I love the food network.
L:  Oh, I love it too.  It's such -- it's such fun --
R:  It's great.
L:  -- to see all the different places that people have and how creative they are with like their restaurants and oh, it's so amazing.
R:  Yeah, like you could definitely get a lot of cool ideas from that if you're looking at starting a -- a restaurant too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, we -- well, actually the one that we're doing it's -- it's -- there's already one here in Missouri so it's really just -- we're franchising.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, so, it -- our menu is pretty much done.  The only thing is, is that the restaurant that they've already opened, it's the first one --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and so they want to make some improvements, because my -- my fiance's been in the, ah, pizza industry for about four years --
R:  Okay, so he has experience.
L:  So, yeah, they're, um, gonna let him be quite flexible.  Um, so, we're excited about that, but he's like, "I'm not a chef" and I'm like, "You don't have to be a chef to, you know, come up with your own ideas".  So, we're trying to come up with some -- some new stuff but a --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of it is just, sort of, marketing and figuring out what people like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] you know?
L:  Right.  Exactly.  Because I think -- well -- or not, I think, but the one that- -- that's opened, it's kind of in a rural community and there is no pizza around --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- for like a thirty mile radius --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- whereas here in the city there are plenty of em.  So, we're trying to come up with some -- some new things and, um, do our own, ah, dough and our own sauce, so.
R:  That sounds really fun.
L:  Well, it's been a lot of fun --
R:  It's cool.
L:  -- it's just -- it's been taking so long, it seems it's taken forever.
R:  Yeah, I bet it's a ton of work.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It is.  And then we have to keep working and still stay focussed on opening the restaurant [several inaudible words] --
R:  How long do you think it'll take you to get everything -- you said you just closed, right?
L:  Right.  Well, no -- no, we just put a contract --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- on the building.  So, we're hoping tha we'll close in thirty days and we're really hoping to be open by, ah, Labor Day.
R:  Wow, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  We're -- we're hoping, we'll see.  Um, after the closing is really when things will kind of -- it'll be crunch time.  We'll have to, you know, do construction and all that.  So, we're excited about it though.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it's a lot of work.
R:  Yeah, it'll be a -- it'll be a busy summer. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it will be, but yeah, food is a big part of our lives.  Definitely.  And the funny -- the weird thing is, is that my fiance he works at this pizza restaurant and he's like, "I don't even like pizza".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I love pizza.
R:  I love pizza.
L:  Love it.  Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
R:  It's good stuff.
L:  Definitely one of my favorites.  Yeah.
R:  That's funny, I don't think I've ever met anybody who didn't like pizza.
L:  Yeah, he -- he just -- he's like, "I've never really cared for it" and he just happened to get this job.  So, he's been there -- I mean, he loves it there but he wants -- w- we both want to do something on our own.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's more exciting that way.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I think one of the other topics, ah, that I wanted to bring up was like, gossiping [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, yeah.  That was one of the -- one of the, ah, negative habits.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, I don't know, I -- I just -- I mean, I think everybody pretty much gossips, but I don't think it's always harmful.  I think a lot of times people are just kind of venting or, you know, just expressing how they feel.  I don't think they gos-
