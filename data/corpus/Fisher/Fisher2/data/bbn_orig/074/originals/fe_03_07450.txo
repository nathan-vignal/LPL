L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  I, um, I'm Kathy.
L:  [NOISE] Hey, ah, Kathy.
R:  How are you?
L:  Ah, I'm Bura[?].  Ah, I'm -- I'm Mette[?], sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no, no problem.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I'm fine, thank you.  What about you?
R:  Oh, not too bad.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's -- it's raining over here --
L:  -- [MN]
R:  -- where I am.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, is it really?
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  Ah, it was raining here too but right now it's pretty fine, um, ah --
R:  Where are you?
L:  In Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  What about you? [MN]
R:  Oh, I'm in Maryland.
L:  In Maryland?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay, it's not far away.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  It's not too far away.
L:  Somehow a dissimilar climate.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I guess they want us to talk about reality TV.
L:  [MN] Yeah, in fact, um, ah, the interesting thing, like n- nowadays I'm writing my thesis --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and somehow not watching anything like f- for about maybe the last, um, three or four months --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and especially the reality shows, so, um ...
R:  Well, I know that I've gotten quite into the different reality shows.  I- it all depends.  I think a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lot of people [COUGH] like it just because it's sort of a way for people to sorta step back --
L:  [MN] Oh, yeah, hm.
R:  -- and not have to deal with everyday life and just watch other people either make a mess of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- themselves or [LAUGH] just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- watch it on TV.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, to me, ah, yeah, I mean, it's -- it's a good introduction.  I was just thinking maybe I should come up and make a reality show name and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- title and talk about the details --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I -- I never talked about kind of, like, why people watch these reality shows.
R:  [MN] Well, it all depends.  I mean, they have shows like The Bachelor which, of course --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm. 
R:  -- appealed to just all sorts of people.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Mostly, you know, women as well as men.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then, of course, then, you have other shows that have come out like American Idol that --
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- appeal to a lot of young people. 
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, that is really a reality show.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  At least one of them.
L:  Isn't it?  [MN] Well, [LAUGH] what [MN] --
R:  Do you watch any of those at all?
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  Have you seen any of those?
L:  -- to [MN] -- I mean, not recently but, um, I was somehow watching, um, Are You Hot.
R:  Oh, with the --
L:  Like, maybe three or four months ago.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I've seen that and that is a reality show.  Why did you like 
L:  I mean --
R:  -- that show?
L:  I don't know [MN] whether it's a reality show but it's basic- -- it was basically a show but [MN] ah, [MN] in fact, I found it, I guess, kind of interesting and -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, like everything was so obvious, um --
R:  Oh, yeah, [MN] definitely.
L:  You know, somehow, like e- everyone wants to be kind of sexy and, like, somehow, ho- hot but it's -- [MN] it was not this much obvious, I mean, in terms of the representation and how [MN] the people comment on that and how they be upset or be happy because of this.  [MN] I guess I -- because the reason everything was obvious on the -- on the scene and, um, [MN] and, like, I don't know, maybe there wasn't e- even any, like, inference or anything, like.  I- it was just there.  Maybe --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- this made me in- +interested to -- to s- -- to watch it.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I really thought, I actually watched it myself.  I wasn't sure really if I had really wanted to watch it but I thought that [MN] it would be a good idea just because it was on and you were just curious and taking a look at it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but -- but really, you know, in watching that, I mean, it's a -- it's a beauty contest.
L:  [MN] Yeah --
R:  I mean, that's what -- 
L:  -- in some manner.  Mhm.
R:  -- that's all it was and it was more -- it's kind of degrading because then, you know, they get the pointer out and they point out all the flaws and then --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they put this sign up of you that says you're hot or you're not.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So [LAUGH], so, you don't know [MN] which one you're gonna be [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- until it's all over.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, isn't it? [LAUGH] It's not going somewhere.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, so that's -- i- -- that -- that was just one other show.  Have you seen any others?
L:  Um, probably I did.  I just don't come up with the names --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with the titles right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, they -- they've had --
L:  With the [inaudible] 
R:  -- like -- they -- I know that they've had other shows like -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, the one where they're on the island.
L:  [MN] Oh, yeah -- 
R:  Oh, yeah, like --
L:  -- the -- about the s- --
R:  -- Survivor and --
L:  Yeah, Survivor, ah, ah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I watch it too.  I -- I, um, maybe which episodes I did.  Um ...
R:  Di- -- ah, I mean, did you follow it from the beginning?
L:  [MN] No, not from the beginning, of course.
R:  Oh, but --
L:  Just, like --
R:  -- did you like it?
L:  -- some of the episodes. [MN] I, kind of, I like it but I was trying to understand, like, [LAUGH] I -- I didn't understand how they have selected these people.  Like, did they voluntarily participate in it or um ...?
R:  They probably, I think, you know, they -- they've done, like, um, interviews with people to see if they could survive in -- in the type of climate and try to get --  
L:  Hm.
R:  -- different types of people.  I mean, usually on these reality shows they bring a bunch of people together.  You always have, like, one person who does all the work.  You have one person who cries all the time.  You have one person that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- screams all the time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then you have the person that's in the middle.  [LAUGH]
L:  You're an expert in this.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean, you know, that- that's why a lot of people watch it because they wanna -- they wanna see, I think, just the people who are interacting with each other and getting into either fights or arguments and --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and it's like that most reality shows seem to have, y- -- oh, at least the ones where they have a lot of people, seem to have a mix of people that get together in order to start up some sort of conflict.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.  
R:  'Cause they're all getting angry at each other, they're all getting mad at each other.  It's like, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and, you know --
L:  [MN] Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- some of the other shows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that have come out recently and, ah --
L:  Ah, m- maybe somehow, like, someone is going to win the whole situation --
R:  Mhm.  
L:  -- or -- or they were to portray it and some others are not going to be successful.  This might, um, be kind of upset. [MN]
R:  Oh, yeah, that's true and, I mean, w- -- they end -- they end up blowing everything out of proportion because, you know, you say one thing and then -- and then they take it some other way and then they make a big story out of it so either everyone loves you or everyone hates you.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like watching a soap opera.
L:  Isn't it exactly?  [MN]  You like --
R:  And you have to -- you have to keep tuning in every week to -- to watch it.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, God.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  This requires lots of time. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that- that's true 'cause, I mean -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you know, then -- then you have people -- I have people at work who talk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about every reality show 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's been on TV --
L:  Oh, God, yeah, mm.
R:  -- be- because they've all watched it and we all start following it and then -- and we drive each other crazy --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- talking about it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have -- do you have like favorites in these shows?  I mean, ah, if it's a kind of like episodes?
R:  Um, I mean, I have a bunch of favorites, I mean, like, you know, for -- for, like -- like, if it's, The Bachelor it's, like, when all the guys get together and they all --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- act like they're -- they're all drunk or they're all doing something and there's something silly.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There was one episode, I think, where they ha- -- it was all the men, they were all together and they ended up, um, um, getting drunk and then they showed some pictures of them all and then they showed one other guy who got really drunk and he walked into the room and he peed on a bed --
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, Go-.
R:  --and it wasn't his own bed.  It was someone else's bed.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  And then he fell asleep in his bed so they decided to carry him out and they put him on the lawn.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And he woke up the next morning and found out -- or he woke up later on and found out where he was and then he went back in and they showed that and everyone that I talked to was dying laughing cause he was --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, everyone was just watching that.  I mean, it's -- it's just that and, like, you know, there's some other shows like, what, Joe Millionaire.  
L:  Oh --
R:  Did you see that?
L:  -- oh, yeah, yeah, yeah I -- yeah, I have seen that one too.
R:  Oh, and I mean that was --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- silly too.  I mean they blew that all totally out of proportion where --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they -- they showed the scene where the -- the blonde and him were there and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they showed it where -- where they were like in the woods.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Did you see that?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And then they were -- you were -- they were making all the sounds in the woods. [MN]
L:  [MN] Um, well, I'm not sure.  Maybe I'm just mixing the, um --
R:  Are you --
L:  -- the reality shows.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it, like, Millionaire -- Millionaire, isn't it kind of like a competition?  They're asking questions.
R:  Yeah, the Joe Millionaire.  It was, like, twenty five women, one guy who all the women think is a millionaire but he's really not a millionaire.  He's a construction worker.
L:  [LAUGH] No, is --
R:  Did you see that one?
L:  No, I didn't see that one.
R:  Oh, okay, so that one you didn't see?
L:  I have seen another one and, like, it was, like, kind of a regular competition, um, show.  Not -- it wasn't like reality show.
R:  Oh, okay, it was something different?
L:  Okay, um, so, I mean, at the end, what happens?
R:  [MN] Well, it turns out that he ends up getting the girl that really didn't want the money and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they end up getting --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they ended up getting together and it turns out that when she finds out that he's not a millionaire she's happy with that but then they find out later that the twist is that they do get money.
L:  Oh.
R:  They get to share a million dollars.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- they gave 'em a million dollar cheque t- -- for the both of them.
L:  Hm.
R:  So that was, [MN] you know, everyone went, "Oh, my God", and, you know.
L:  [MN]
R:  And then, of course, you know, ah, when the show's over after they air it you find out later that they get back together but it doesn't work out.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, he keeps his five hundred and she kept her five hundred --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and the jewellery that she got and that was about it.
L:  Maybe it's better.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Well, I mean, you know, if it doesn't work out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, I mean, they only do this --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- for, what, like, six weeks and unless, you know, you're willing to -- to -- to be with someone forever [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  Mhm.  
R:  Then, usually those kinda things don't work out I wouldn't think [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but I -- I think it's just the fun of it all that everyone, you know, wants to see people either have a good time or have a really bad time [MN] --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  
R:  -- and they don't want --
L:  Probably.
R:  -- to reflect on their own life because, you know, everyone's busy and then you wanted to sorta get away and sorta watch these kind of things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you have time, you know, for -- for -- 
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the pleasure of entertainment.
L:  [MN] Exactly.  What about, um, if I direct the conversation to another --
