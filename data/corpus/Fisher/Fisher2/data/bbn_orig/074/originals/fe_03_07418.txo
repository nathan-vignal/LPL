R:  Rick O'Merrill and I'm calling from California.
L:  Hello.  I'm [inaudible] and I'm calling from California.
R:  Okay.  Uh, well, the -- the topics -- she went kind of quickly -- but I -- I -- the one I got it was, uh, what's worse -- smoking, gossiping, drinking?  And I didn't get the last two.
L:  I -- I'm having trouble hearing ya.  Can ya just speak a little bit louder?
R:  Okay, sure.  I said that, um, I had trouble hearing the topic.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I -- if I remember correctly it was what's worse -- smoking, drinking, gossiping?  And I forgot the last two.  She mentioned two other items.
L:  I -- I got the same ones that you got.
R:  Okay.  So, I guess we'll try those three.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, so, what -- what do you think is worse -- gossiping, drinking or smoking?
L:  Now, the question is which is worse?
R:  Yeah, which is worse.
L:  Okay.  I think gossiping.
R:  Gossiping?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And your argument for that would be?
L:  Um, it -- it can ruin a person's standing in the community.  It can ruin a person's reputation.  It can be vicious.  Um, gossip generally comes down the line from one person to another and it gets distorted along the way usually.
R:  Yeah.  I agree with you [COUGH] one hundred percent.  Uh, the other, um, two top- -- the other two items -- smoking and drinking, uh, on some occasions you do hurt other people, but in most cases you're hurting yourself, uh, and gossiping you're definitely hurting another person.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, uh, that's my argument why I think gossiping is worse.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like you said, uh, you can, uh, totally ruin a person's reputation, uh, it doesn't matter how old are you, you can spread rumors when you're in school about your fellow classmates, at work you can ruin careers.  So, um, I -- I mean, I agree gossiping is worse.  In terms of smoking and drinking you might be irresponsible and, uh, get behind the wheel and, you know, injure someone or, you know, ill someone.  But in most cases you're hurting yourself.  It's unhealthy.  You ruin your liver.  The same thing with smoking, so, um, that's, uh ...
L:  Well, both of those things too can be done in moderation.
R:  Exactly.
L:  But you're right it's -- it's self inflicted injury if there is any.  But so far it's not -- well, all three of them are -- are not against any law on the book.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, um, I don't think that -- that -- that the first two are necessarily bad.  They can be if done to excess certainly.
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, one thing, um [LIPSMACK] -- I'm surprised we're saying that, uh -- well, not surprised but, uh, you would think that it's more taboo nowadays in terms of smoking or drinking.  It seems like, uh, gossip which I think -- as we both agreed it's somewhat worse --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it seems like we're celebrating in our culture, um, mostly with entertainment programs like, you know, Entertainment Tonight or Hard Copy, things like that, they're basically, um -- they deal with celebrity gossip or things like that, you know?
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  And I think the political campaigns are run mainly on gossip and --
R:  Yeah, a large portion is.
L:  -- untruths, half truths.
R:  Yeah.  Half truths, things being twisted around, uh, like I said, I -- in just, you know, careers and things like that and yet it's celebrated.  I mean, radio and, you know?  Um, Monday morning at work you might -- if you're not gossiping about your fellow, um, employees you're gossiping about what you read in the paper and the calendar section about the movie stars and things like that.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I -- yeah, I agree with that.  Um, it -- it can destroy a person actually.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not only hurt them but destroy them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in -- in that it can destroy somebody's career or their goals.
R:  Yeah.  Do you think it makes a difference if, uh -- in terms of gossip if something's actually true and something isn't true, or do you think that, um, either way it's wrong?
L:  Well, as I said ...
R:  I mean, something can be gossip, but it can also be true.  You know what I'm trying to say, right? 
L:  It -- it could be, but the more mouths that it goes through the more chance there is to get distorted.
R:  That -- that's true.
L:  You know that game that kids play?
R:  That's what I was thinking in elementary school where you -- you tell one person, uh --
L:  Yeah.  You go around the circle.
R:  -- whispering in ears.  Exactly.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's not so -- you know, just a smaller thing and obviously it changes, the times change or the person involved changes, or the -- the act changes.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that's ...  And the other thing, um, just in -- in general, um, the other -- I know the other two, uh, things that she mentioned, um, alcohol and tobacco in terms of smoking and drinking, those things can be regulated by the government.  I don't think the government would ever regulate, um, gossip.
L:  No, it would be impossible.
R:  It would be impossible 'cause of your first amendment rights unless the gossip just tends to be, um, like you said, uh, half truths and then you might get some kind of libel suit or things like that.  But as long as something is true, um, I guess people can gossip all they want and, you know, it might hurt ...
L:  Of course, you never can tell what they're gonna do with this homeland security.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.  Yeah.  I'm -- every day something else will pop up.  So, I guess if you're gossiping about, um, someone, you know -- might, you know -- just talking about doing certain things, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you never know word might get out and boom, next thing you know you have somebody knocking on your door.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Knocking on the person's door.  So, if you're gonna gossip about things like that I guess you have to be sure you're -- you know, it's pretty obvious you're making a joke not -- and, uh, you know, stay with a straight face.  So ...
L:  Yeah, an interesting topic that they chose for us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I won- --
R:  But I still -- 
L:  -- I wonder ...
R:  -- I still don't know ...
L:  Huh?
R:  Uh, I said I still don't know what the other two, uh, subjects that the, uh -- they chose because they mentioned five things.  But she -- she spoke real quickly --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and I missed it.
L:  Yeah, I did too.  I did too.  Are you in the -- are you southern or northern California?
R:  Southern California, Southern California in, uh -- in the Los Angeles area.
L:  Ah, okay.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Yep.  Me -- me too, southern.
R:  Okay.  So ...
L:  Is this your first telephone call?
R:  It's actually the third phone call.
L:  Yeah, me ...
R:  I guess, uh -- when I signed up they said one -- one, uh -- one, two and three -- and this is my third one.  So, how 'bout you, the first one?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  I just signed up this morning.
R:  Oh, did you?  Okay.  Yeah.  I ...
L:  So, this -- this was quick.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I signed up about -- around I guess a couple of weeks ago and I put down the times and sure enough right on time they called.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  It goes by pretty, uh, quickly.  Just out of curiosity, have you ever, um, been, uh, injured by, uh -- by gossip or things like that or affected by someone gossiping about you?
L:  Yes.
R:  You have, okay.
L:  Yeah, I have.
R:  So, maybe, um -- so, okay, so you have personal experience.  That's why you probably also said that, uh, gossip is worse than drinking and smoking.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I haven't been affec- -- I haven't been affected that much, but it was just common courtesy that -- like I mentioned earlier in most cases alcohol and smoking is -- if you do them in moderation it's okay and in most cases you're injuring yourself if go overboard.  Gossip it might just be one time, um, but that -- things just spread and spread and spread and boom, the next thing you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the person's, um, whole reputation [inaudible].  She might be a -- or he might be like a role model in, uh -- in the community and something gets outta hand and boom, it takes years to recuperate that, your reputation.
L:  Yeah.  Correct.  And -- and I think many people do it to wreck, um, people's aspirations.
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]  And in most cases it's, uh, deliberate.  I ...
L:  And you -- and you see it in the political circles all the time.  If -- if you -- if you really read what people are saying about one another, politicians, they're -- it's half truths.  Many times its half truths or downright lying.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just ...
R:  Most of them are half truths and in most cases -- well, I guess unless you're really involved and follow things real closely people tend to believe it or they -- they might assume that well, even if it's not totally true where there's smoke there's fire.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And that's the damaging part.
R:  You think [inaudible] are gender or age or, you know, education, um, background of who enjoys gossip more and things like that, or a regional part with somebody from the urban city -- urban areas enjoy gossip more than the rural areas, or an age or a gender thing?
L:  I think it has to do with how large your world is.  Maybe how open your mind is.  If you have a very small closed up life without too many interests I'm sure that gossip is more prevalent in your conversations with other people.
R:  Okay, 'cause you're reaching for something to, uh, take -- to occupy your time or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to discuss a matter?
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you're like, um -- have other interests, things like that, you can always talk about that and focus on that and your mind will -- will be, uh, concentrating on those things.  Oh, okay, that's a very interesting concept.  It has to do with your world.
L:  Yeah.  I read a quote once where people with small minds talk about one another, gossip, and people with larger minds --
