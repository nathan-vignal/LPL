L:  [SIGH]  Oh, hi, my name's Jeffrey Larter[?].
R:  Hi, I'm Phyllis.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  Hi!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Okay, [LAUGH] me too.  Um, I don't really have a favorite holiday.
L:  I don't -- I -- I like Christmas.
R:  Yeah, Christmas is good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, Christmas is cool.  [SIGH]  And Halloween's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I like Halloween, like, playing tricks on people and decorating.  Decorating for Halloween's like --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- m- more fun to me than, like, decorating for Christmas.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  But ... it depends, like, where I'm at for Christmas because if I'm around my family Christmas is good. But then [SIGH] sometimes, like, if I'm away from them it gets kind of like ... lonely, you know?
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [MN]  It's a nice holiday.  I -- I'd rather receive than give.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  It makes me -- yeah, it can be a very expensive holiday, though.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, that's true [LAUGH] ... especially if you, like, don't know -- or if you, like, have a friend who you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is going to get you something expensive [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- and so you, sort of, feel like you have to [LAUGH] ... get them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something expensive too.
L:  Mm.  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I was [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was never really good at picking out good presents.
R:  Yeah, I always -- I t- tend to put, like, too much thought into it.  And then I get 'em something a- and I, like, t- think it must be perfect.  But then they get it and they're disappointed and I'm, like, -- oh, it just depresses me 'cause I'm, like, -- I put --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- so much thought into it.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I always try to ma- -- even, like, if someone gets me a real bad [NOISE] present, I try to pretend that I [LAUGH] like it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [COUGH]  Yeah, like my parents used to get me -- they used to get me presents and I -- I'd like it [MN] I -- but I -- but it'd be real weird and I'd say, "O- oh, thank you" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and it was like -- and I -- I'd act --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'd act like I liked it.  I mean, they were okay [SIGH] they got me real nice presents.  It -- it's the thought --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that counts.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But unfortunately people don't think that way when I get them presents.
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah, [SIGH] you know.  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have another favorite holiday -- I mean another holiday that you like, like Thanksgiving o- or something like that?
R:  Mm.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
R:  I don't really like Thanksgiving because my family usually ends up fighting.  [MN]
L:  Oh!  I --
R:  They don't -- they don't fight mean they just end up, like, someone --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- gets mad because of something.  You know, it's just like little fights, sort of, thing.  O- oh, it just gets in the way.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Thanksgiving -- Thanksgiving I kind of like that.  I -- I just like to eat a lot.
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  That's c- c- cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  We always have, like, turkey leftovers for, like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a whole year.  It's like, "Oh, my --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- goodness".  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, one year we got -- we got a r- really big turkey.  I can't remember exactly how much it weighed but it was -- it was huge.
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, my grandmother she ma- -- whenever she -- whenever she makes [SIGH] -- as soon as she makes a turkey --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] corn, mashed potatoes, [SIGH] um, she --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- makes ... sweet potatoes, yams, ch- -- all this other stuff.
R:  Oh, wow!  That's cool.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  T- that's fun.  [MN]  I just felt -- like the one year we decided -- [SIGH] I think my --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on- one go way with her husband's family instead of like my aunt and she's, like, our family [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so that they're like -- and so we decided, "Okay, well we won't have a big family Thanksgiving this year" [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and so we just -- and it was just, like, 'cause --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we went to -- out to a restaurant and stuff, like, "This isn't Thanksgiving" [NOISE] --
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  -- and it felt like just wrong.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then the next year ... we got together again and it was like, [NOISE]  "Yeah, this is right.  This is Thanksgiving".  [NOISE]  But ...
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the m- main reason I like [SIGH] Thanksgiving and, ah, ... and Christmas holidays is because I'm with my family.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  And usually, like, at Christmas time everyone tries to be nice to each other, at least in my family.  [SIGH]  You know, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- t- they just put aside their differences for a while and it's nice.  [SIGH]
L:  [COUGH]  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  I ... also like ... Fourth of July.
R:  Y- yeah.  That's cool.
L:  That's fun: fireworks -- American displaying of patriotism.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  A- around here, like, everybod-  -- it's, like, two different t- theme parks li- -- o- or amusement parks, real close to us --
L:  [COUGH]  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] and now there's, like, there's big competitions with their [NOISE] fireworks so each one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- has, like, [SIGH] synchronized to ... music on the radio stations.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  They give out Three D glasses and stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  It gets really wild.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  But we usually g- go to, like, a little one.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I live near --
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- Hershey Park so they ha- -- they have, like, a laser light show.
R:  Oh, cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, th- that's cool.
R:  Yeah, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I'm in Pennsylvania too and it's like that too now.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  That's cool.  [NOISE]  And we usually go to, like, a little one at the park.  And they, like, these pavilions and we --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- sit on the roof a- and w- watch.  And that's, like, really fun.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [NOISE]  [COUGH]  So, if -- if -- if you could make a holiday what would you make?  What kind of holiday would you make?
R:  [NOISE]  O- o- oh, [SIGH] I don't know.  [SIGH]  I think I'd try to put one, [NOISE] like, ... in August because there's no holidays there.  You ha- -- like, have a holiday.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  But I don't know what it would be.  [SIGH]
L:  It gets a little boring.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  My birthday's coming up soon and I can't wait.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  It's in July.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  Do you usually have, like, a big party?  [SIGH]
L:  Not any more.  I used to but not any more.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Mm.
R:  [NOISE]  That's cool.  [SIGH]  That's --
L:  [NOISE]  A- and --
R:  I -- I -- oh, go ahead.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, my whole -- my whole fam- [SIGH] -- like, t- three of my family's birthdays, [SIGH] my sister's, my dad and mine are also in July.  It's a little weird.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, that is weird.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Do you usually have, like, joint birthdays o- or do you try to keep them separate?  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, I hate th- -- yeah, well --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well for --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I hate [SIGH] when I have to share my birthday with my sister because we used to get [LIPSMACK] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- we used to get [SIGH] where we -- where -- I -- I don't get as many presents ... because of my sister.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Well, one friend's mom's birthday's on Christmas Eve.  And she said that's what always happens 'cause [SIGH] everyone thinks it cute to combine it [LAUGH] but i- it's not.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  That would really -- that would really suck.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, it's -- and -- but -- but it's really good when I have to buy for that -- when I have to buy for those type of people though.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] that's true.
R:  Yeah, it's a lot easier.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  I know my birthday is near H- Halloween and so I always get, like, Halloween presents.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.  [SIGH]
R:  But that's okay 'cause I like Halloween.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- u- um, [LIPSMACK] well -- I'm can't think, um ... [NOISE] I was going to say something but I can't remember.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Okay, you go ahead.  U- u- um.
R:  [LAUGH]  That'd be weird if you're birthday was, like, near Presidents' Day and you got Presidents' Day p- presents.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, wh- what would they give you for that?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  I don't know, like, the little silhouettes they sell maybe.  [LAUGH]  The ones you hang up in your window.
L:  Y- yeah, well --
R:  [LAUGH]  "Here's a flag", "Oh, good".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, or like a -- like a bust of President Lincoln.  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Or they could give you money that has Presidents Day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [SIGH] that would be fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's us- -- that's what I get usually now.
R:  Mm.
L:  Bu- -- and one year for my birthday I got ... I got a camcorder, whi- -- that was probably one of the best things I got and the other time I got a laptop.
R:  Wow!  That's cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Those are -- those are the fun birthdays.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  That is cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, now I get money.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, that's fun too.  [SIGH]
L:  Money's good.  [SIGH]
R:  It's easy to personalize.  [LAUGH]  Ye- --  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I got my d- dog for ... m- my birthday one y- year.  [LAUGH]  That was pretty cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Huh.  [SIGH]
R:  'Cause they, like, surprised me with it.  They just, like, opened up my door and let the dog run in to my room to wake me up.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But I was so mad 'cause it scared me out of my mind, [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause we didn't h- have a dog --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [LAUGH] and then all of a sudden there was this a- animal in my bed.  [SIGH]  It scared me but --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, that was a good present though.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  That was funny.
L:  [MN]  If I make a holiday --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I would probably make a holiday [SIGH] -- I don't know -- I -- I'd have to make it -- yeah, like, right in August like you said, [NOISE] somewhere between there.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]  Because they don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they don't have many holidays round there and I don't think I can wait [SIGH] ... that -- t- that ti- -- that much time between them.  [SIGH]  [MN]  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it'd be a holiday where you have to give presents --
R:  [LAUGH]  That's a good idea.
L:  -- except -- except for the inventor.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah, holidays with presents are definitely fun.
L:  Yeah, until you --
R:  [SIGH]  And you --
L:  -- have to give them.
R:  Y- y- yeah, but I always -- sometimes I, like, find stuff and I'm like, "Oh, this would be so perfect for so and so".  It's, like, "Yeah, but their birthday's so far away.  Christmas is so far away"
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  It'd be cool to have a time just to give stuff, you know.
L:  Uh-hum.  Yeah.  [COUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean it -- it -- it feels good to give [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- but it's not cheap.
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  That's true.
L:  It's an expensive feeling.
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [COUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They should have lots of songs, too, for the holidays.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [MN]  I don't like Christmas songs t- too much but I --
L:  Nor do I.  I- it's boring.
R:  But --
L:  Those are boring.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Like, every time you work somewhere they always, like, play Christmas carols, like, the whole time you're working there.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And it's -- so you're just -- like, by the end of the day you're just, like, [LAUGH] so sick of 'em.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I worked in a grocery store once.  They had, like, ten Christmas carols they played over and over and over.  [LAUGH]  And l- like --
L:  [SIGH]  O- oh, I bet that was fun.  [SIGH]
R:  O- oh, yeah, and they started in, like, November of course [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they ran until, like, Christmas.  I was, like, "S- stop!"
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  T- that's so weird how stores keep -- start selling Christmas stuff so early.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  They really do, like, right after Halloween --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- it's, like, Christmas.  [MN]
L:  [MN]
R:  Mm.  So, ...  [LAUGH]  [MN]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, um [NOISE] --
R:  Well, could I --
L:  -- Ho- -- I like Ho- -- I like the Halloween tapes the best.  Those are fun.
R:  Y- yeah, those are pretty cool.  [SIGH]
L:  Those are pretty cool.
R:  Like the -- the -- m- music ones or the sound ones?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, the sound ones.
R:  Oh, yeah, ... cool.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I like going to, like, the ... h- haunted house and stuff for Halloween.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, that's fun.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  We went to Universal last year for t- their H- Halloween Horror Nights.  [SIGH]
