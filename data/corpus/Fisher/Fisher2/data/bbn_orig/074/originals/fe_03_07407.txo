R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My name's Holly.
L:  Polly?
R:  Holly with an H.
L:  Holly.  I'm Carrie.
R:  Hi.  It's nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to talk to you.  Um, where you calling from?
R:  Um, I'm in North Carolina.  How 'bout you?
L:  Okay.  I'm in Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, okay.  Cool.
L:  I ...
R:  This is only my second call.  I keep getting these weird topics.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] It's my third one.  Before they were easier, like, um, uh -- I had like how do you feel about sports?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Something about sports.
R:  I hung up on that one.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I don't really -- it wasn't something I really felt strongly about either way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it was like I talked.
R:  Me neither.
L:  But ...
R:  So, this one is like what do we think is worse --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- of this list.
L:  I didn't even hear it all.
R:  I think it was -- okay, I think it was gossiping, smoking ...
L:  Smoking, drinking, or using caffeine excessively.
R:  Right.
L:  And there's some- -- there's something I didn't hear I think.
R:  Um, oh, um [LIPSMACK], overeating and -- or not exercising.
L:  Oh, okay.  Overeating was the one.  I didn't understand what she was talking -- I didn't understand what she said.  Um [LAUGH] --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you wanna go first?
R:  Um, okay.  [LAUGH] Um, let's see.  Probably the worst I guess, and I do this, is smoking.
L:  [LAUGH] Like I'm -- I'm an occasional smoker.  A lotta my friends smoke and I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smoke with them.  So, it does definitely turn off nonsmokers like right away.
R:  I know.
L:  And they can smell it on you and [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  I know.  I hate it.  Gosh, I hate it.  I hate being a smoker.  But I think probably it's w- -- as far as health goes that's probably the worst one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I mean, I know the other ones -- some of the other ones can be bad too.  But, um, I don't know.  I think gossiping w- wouldn't ...
L:  Yeah.  If you -- I think if -- if you're talking about yourself having -- maybe something like smoking or like alcohol, something that's bad for your health --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but your friends may be gossiping.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, then you can't trust them.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And that -- it can get so out of hand, you know, it's like -- I don't know -- you think of it as kinda like a middle school or high school thing, but really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it happens like later in life too.
L:  Everyone does it.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, how 'bout you, what do you think is the worst?
L:  Prob- probably gossiping, although like I've had friends that just drink and it's like I -- I can't be friends with you anymore [LAUGH] practically.  Like, my old roommate he -- he couldn't drink a little bit.
R:  Right.
L:  He'd always get like really drunk and really obnoxious and then like ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, it -- it might depend on the person.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And some people are fun drunks, but [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- other people you can't be around.
R:  That is true.  That's true.  I get silly whenever I drink too much.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm ...
L:  I -- I get talky.
R:  Yeah.  Like I just get happy, but some people, like you said, they get really nasty and stuff.
L:  Oh, it was always like we had parties and he'd just get so drunk and like try to start fights with people --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was just we're the -- we're hosting.  [LAUGH]
R:  God!
L:  We're not supposed be starting stuff.
R:  That's awful.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, my God!  That must've been embarrassing.
L:  I'd just have to calm him down.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  It was -- that's -- it got to the point where it was embarrassing, it wasn't funny.
R:  Yeah.  Did he like remember it afterward?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  And he would -- he wouldn't regret it.  He'd be like still mad at that person.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God!  [LAUGH]
L:  It was like, oh.
R:  That's funny.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Gosh, you'd think at least he would be like, you know, gosh, I acted like an idiot last night.  I'm sorry.  Or something like that.
L:  You'd think.  But he was a little bit of just an idiot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, drunk or sober.  [LAUGH]
R:  Jeeze!
L:  But -- and I was kinda surprised about the choices they said.
R:  I know.
L:  Like using -- oh, man, it bothers me when people use [LAUGH] caffeine excessively.
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  I never even thought of that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh!  Like, that is like so up there with smoking and drinking too much and stuff.  Gosh!
L:  I -- I mean, I guess, it ha- -- I mean, like my Dad's told -- told me the other day that like one of his friends was like, "John, do you have a problem?  I never see you without a cup of coffee".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's true, but I never really thought about it being --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a problem.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  It's not like, you know, he's got ...
L:  [several inaudible words] behavior or ...
R:  Yeah.  He's not like getting in car wrecks or anything because of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like there's ...
L:  Oh, did you see ...?
R:  Uh-uh?
L:  Go ahead.
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.  [LAUGH]  Are you on a cell phone?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, me too, that's why we're having a little lag there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  But when I signed up for this I didn't have a home phone number.  So --
R:  Oh, okay.
L: -- take my cell phone.
R:  Mine just -- it rings my cell phone if I have the computer connected and I had it connected.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so when I hadn't answered it.  But, um, what was I going to say?  Oh, um, excessive alcohol use I think is really bad.  I mean, not just like in cases of your friend, but obviously when people go out and drink way too much and then they, you know, kill people in their cars --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  That's a problem.
R:  That's really bad.
L:  I never really thought about like overeating either.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like -- I don't know -- maybe just not enough people overeat so that it interferes with their life, but ...
R:  Right.  Well, I guess ...
L:  I -- I guess that's like a health thing too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's more like a thing where if you do it it's not really gonna affect other people that much, you know?
L:  Oh, I have a good example.
R:  What?
L:  My friend -- my friend has like, um, heart trouble in his family, like really badly, like his Dad died when he was thirty eight, his uncle died when he was forty two, um --
R:  Right.  [COUGH]
L:  -- and they were -- like, I think his Dad -- I know his Dad was and I think his uncle was overweight and like when you have such a prob- -- like history you probably should not -- you should be as healthy as you can and you should not be --
R:  Right.
L:  -- overweight, and he's overweight.
R:  Right.
L:  So, like I guess with something like that, but still it's more -- I felt -- I always felt like it was more personal --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I could be like that's an annoying habit.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think it is more personal.  I think the only people that it can affect really is -- well, you know, anybody that's close to you like your family or friends --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- if you get sick or something like that then it's gonna start affecting other people too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But I think, you know, for the most -- if -- I mean, if you get like really big or something where it's like a health problem --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  But ...
L:  Did you see anything in the news?  I saw yesterday some state, I don't remember which one, where people wanna drink and drive, like literally, like have beers in the car and stuff.
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  It was on one of the major networks there were like people fighting for their right to drink and drive and I was like ...
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  That's insane.
L:  I mean, what are they thinking?  I mean, technically you're not gonna have the blood alcohol level or whatever, but if you -- I mean, you're getting there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you're already in your car.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  Right.  That's crazy.
L:  Yeah.  I wanna find out what state this is 'cause that's just wacky.
R:  Oh, my gosh, that -- I don't think they would approve such a thing.  I can't imagine.
L:  I don't think so either.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it would depend on how long you were driving but, I mean, unless you --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just got in your car, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it could be bad.
L:  Or if you're like leaving somewhere --
R:  Right.
L:  -- where you have a few drinks ...
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That would be -- yeah, that would definitely be a problem.
L:  But it was like a commercial before the news and the commercial was weird too 'cause it was there like -- it's common place in some areas already, but -- and I was like where?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  I don't know.
R:  I might have to look that up on the Internet or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  That's crazy.  Oh, my gosh!
L:  I'll have to see where that is.
R:  Yeah.  I cannot imagine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And sometimes they just go for like sensation I think --
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  -- where they're like oh, five people are trying to do that?  Well, that's -- that's crazy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  They turn it into a news story.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What -- what's the other one?  Not exercising?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Well, that goes along with the, you know, overeating, you know?
L:  Yeah.  It's just a personal thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I don't know.  Like certain people -- if you're really, um, athletic you're probably gonna see your really athletic friends more, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't think it's like ...
R:  Right.
L:  Or you can make judgment on other people and be like that bothers me.
R:  I know.
L:  But that -- that like infringes on your own life too.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  It's like I don't care if my neighbor's out there exercising or not it's up to them.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If they wanna do that.
L:  Do that.
R:  You know?  That's where like smoking is different because smoking affects other people I guess if I'm sitting out somewhere and I light up a cigarette --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  But if I sit out somewhere and I wanna overeat then, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's a different story, or if I just wanna not exercise, you know?
L:  Yeah.  So, you're in North Carolina?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can you smoke in the bars there?
R:  We can in the bars, but not in, um ...
L:  Restaurants?
R:  Well, in -- in some restaurants you can -- they still have smoking sections, but they're -- like more and more are doing it where they just have --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- non smoking in the whole thing.
L:  Okay.  I was just wondering 'cause my cousin came to visit me --
