R:  Hi.  How we doing?  My name's Brandon.
L:  Hello.  I'm Angela.
R:  Hi, Angela.  How are you?
L:  Hey, good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Good.  Good.  So, you watch a lotta reality T.V. shows, huh?
L:  Um, I do.
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, what I used to watch was Temptation Island.  That was the best one.
L:  That's Temptation Island?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I never watched that one.
R:  No.  It was ...
L:  I watched, um, let's see, The Bachelor and Joe Millionaire.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, I guess that's all.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I tried to watch that one about the masked faces.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But it didn't -- I didn't really watch all of that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that was, uh, Mr. Personality.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That was pretty good.  I mean, I only watched them just really like to pass the time and when my favorite sitcoms are not on.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.
L:  I don't know.
R:  So, where you ...?
L:  There's something
R:  Huh?
L:  -- there's something about 'em that are just kinda interesting.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You feel like you wanna sit -- get away from 'em, but they're just kinda so interesting you have to stay.
R:  And then there's so many of 'em on T.V. now, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Every channel -- every major network has a reality T.V. show, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  And it's like well, how do you get away from them?  Well, you may as well indulge and watch 'em, you know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- see what they're all about.
L:  Yep.  I saw an article today that there's a -- a website that has, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- they're trying to dig up dirt on all the people that are on these shows --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like if they've had a D.W.I. or something before.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!  Wow!  I guess being on those shows kinda puts you like in the public eye where people can really put -- put you under the microscope and find out, you know --
L:  That's exactly right.
R:  -- your history.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, shows like, uh, Fear Factor, now that's like a kinda show that I wouldn't mind being on, you know?
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  Where there's money involved, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, money involved.  My son he's only seven --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, he likes to watch that one.  So, we watch it together and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, it's just -- we just keep saying, you know, "You don't do this really.  You don't do this really".  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  Those ...
L:  But we don't really have to tell him twice on all the eating the gross stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He wouldn't do that.
R:  No, that's right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, that's right.  Well, the, um -- what was the other part of the topic here?
L:  Um, do you watch 'em and why do ya think they're so popular?
R:  Oh, oh.  Yeah, I think they're popular because a lotta people kinda compare them to their real life, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and watch 'em because they, uh -- they kinda like see themselves in it, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Especially the -- the Mr. Bachelor one, Andrew Firestone.  I mean, that probably was a girl's dream that, uh, you know, just to meet or even get close enough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to really know somebody, you know, on that type of level, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Being Andrew Firestone.
L:  And also I think sometimes people watch so they can say, "I can't believe these people are doing that.  I would never do that".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, they can feel better about themselves.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's true.  Plus it -- it kinda makes like a conversational piece, you know, around the workplace and, you know --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- uh, with, you know, just people you meet on a daily -- on a day to day basis, you know?
L:  Yep.  That's true.  A lotta people were into Survivor and they'd say, you know, "Oh, who do ya think is gonna be next and everything?"
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  That's how Temptation Island was before that, you know, and plus they'd be going to all these exotic places, you know?
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  You can live a little vicariously through them, the other people.
R:  Mm.
L:  You don't think you'll ever be going [LAUGH] places like that yourself.
R:  Yep.  Es- especially, you know, with a bunch of strangers that you don't even know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and all ya come together for this one sole purpose, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  Wow!
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  Right.  Now, there was one on T.V. that I seen -- what was it? -- um, I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Outta Here.  Did you ever watch that?
L:  I never saw that one.
R:  Yeah.  It was -- it wasn't bad.  It's just that they used a lot -- it was similar to the Survivor, but they would use a lot of, um, celebrities --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and put 'em on this island --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and see how they would, um, come together as a team and, you know, try to get off the island.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.  It -- it was pretty treat.  That Great Amazing Race is pretty good too.  I like that one.
L:  [MN] I never --
R:  But they have like --
L:  I never watched that one.
R:  -- four or five, maybe six teams --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, they have to race from one point of the United States around the world --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and come back again.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a pretty ...
L:  That's interesting.
R:  That one was pretty good just to see ...
L:  The one ...
R:  Huh?
L:  I don't know if it's started yet, the one about where all the ladies know that whoever wins gets a million dollars, but the man doesn't know.
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  That one looks so rude.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But I wanted to catch it, but I don't know when it starts or anything --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or I've already missed it but, I mean, how rude.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  This guy thinks all these women like him for him --
R:  Now --
L:  -- and they just want the money.
R:  -- have you seen that one about the family where they put in -- in the house together and they all have to get along, but one of 'em only has a chance to win a million dollars or something?
L:  No, I haven't seen that one.
R:  I think that was last season they had it on T.V.  It didn't last long because I -- I don't think it's coming back for another season.
L:  Huh.
R:  But they had, uh, one family that they would take, you know, an average family --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and put them in this multi million dollar mansion --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, basically --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- what they had to do was like, um, connive each other into either leaving the house, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- make somebody really, really mad to leave the house, so the -- the one person left there gets the million dollars.
L:  Huh.
R:  Yeah.  It was ...
L:  Yeah, and I think the servants were the judges or something like that.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  I think I did hear about that one.  But then I heard about one that's coming up that's, um -- the kids are gonna pick a -- a Dad for the Mom, or a Mom for their Dad --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or something like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you hear about that one?
R:  No, I haven't.
L:  Yeah.  That one's coming up but, I mean, you know, like my Mom has been single a long time and she needs a man and we're gonna pick him.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's gotta be kinda strange.
L:  Yeah.  That's for sure.
R:  Wow!
L:  That's for sure.
R:  Yeah.  These reality T.V. shows are really taking over the networks.  I guess they're getting rave reviews about 'em, you know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and the ratings are really going high.
L:  Yep.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Sometimes I think they go a little too far.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They do.  They do.  Especially when, you know, I mean, they put somebody's life at stake or, you know, when they tell you, "Well, you can win this X. amount of money" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and how people can be so disrespectful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, to others just because of money, you know?
L:  Yep.
R:  I don't think our society was geared that way, you know, that we would lower our own morals and standards just to be -- just for a dollar, you know?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I think we like to watch other people do it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Folks like you and I probably would never do -- never participate it in it just because, you know ...?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Strange.
L:  Yep.  I think you're right.
R:  Strange.
L:  But, uh, anyway, it's kinda -- kinda fun to watch.  There's one, um, it's not a reality show like all the other ones, but it is kinda neat, where they take a family -- this is on P.B.S. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they take a family and, um, they put 'em in an old time house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they live like without electricity --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and without running water and all this stuff.
R:  Mhm.  Wow!
L:  But you get to watch them kinda live for a week.  It's -- it's not -- it's not bad like some of the ones, like Temptation Island or anything --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but it's still watching --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- people live in real life.
R:  Right, and how they get along, huh?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Wow!  Wow!
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's gotta be strange.
L:  Yep.
R:  I'd -- I'd rather stick to game shows, you know, like the Price is Right and --
L:  [LAUGH] I do like game shows.
R:  -- Who Wants to be a Millionaire and stuff like that, you know, to have to do where they test your knowledge and things, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I couldn't do those reality T.V. shows like that. 
L:  Yep.  I did watch the one where the people picked somebody to marry.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But none of 'em actually chose to get married at the end.
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.
L:  None of 'em actually got married.
R:  [MN]
L:  But some of the -- some of the ones on that Bachelor they really were getting catty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the women.
R:  Is -- is this The Bachelor --
L:  Um --
R:  -- or the Bachelorette?
L:  -- no, I might've been Joe Millionaire.
R:  Okay.
L:  That one.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  They were getting kinda catty.
R:  Wow!
L:  But he didn't know it and -- and they're like, "Don't pick that one, she's so rude".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And then you probably see these people in real life and they're probably nothing like how they portray themselves on T.V., you know?
L:  That's true.  That's true.  That's I think why that website is doing so well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is 'cause people really wanna see what they do when they're not on camera.
R:  All for a dollar.
L:  Yep.  Yep.
R:  [NOISE] Unbelievable.  Well, I know they're probably gonna be coming out with some new ones next season.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  There was one on T.V. that I haven't seen yet, Meet My Folks, have you seen that one?
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  It's where, uh, the girl or guy brings home their -- you know, the person that they met, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, their parents like critique this guy and it's -- it's really crazy.  It's really crazy.  I've seen the coming attractions, you know, the, um -- on T.V., but I haven't really taken the time out to watch it.
L:  Huh.
R:  But that's supposed to be really weird too and then the parents get to say whether or not that their daughter or son can be with that person or not.
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Meet My Folks.  It's -- I think it's on M.B.C. if I'm not mistaken.
L:  Huh.  That's like a parents' dream --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- getting to choose who's gonna be with their kid.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I would -- I would -- I would -- I have a daughter fourteen and one two years old and my fourteen year old she's not into boys or -- or -- you know, I have to wait a while, but ...
L:  Oh, goodness!  Lucky you.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  No.  She's an honorable student at school, you know?  So --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- she's focused.
L:  That's awesome.
R:  She stays focused.  But it would be kinda neat, you know, to see who she would pick, you know, twenty or thirty years down the line.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Twenty, thirty years, yeah.
R:  There ya go.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  There ya go.  Nothing immediate, you know?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  God, I hope not.  I pray, you know?  [NOISE]
L:  Yep.
R:  Do you have any kids as well?
L:  Yes, I have a, um -- a five year old and -- and an almost --
