L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Barbara.
L:  [NOISE] I'm Nancy[?].
R:  Hi, Nancy.  W- --
L:  Hi. [NOISE] [COUGH]
R:  So, reality TV, do you watch it?
L:  No, I hate it.
R:  You hate it?
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  I -- I hate most of them.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I do watch some of them though.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- most of them are --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just so phoney --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- and --
L:  [NOISE] [several inaudible words].
R:  So, why do people watch them?
L:  [NOISE] [SIGH] Um -- well, I don't know.  I think that since they're kind of, ah -- with just every day [NOISE] people, I think, ah, maybe there's some [NOISE] sense of that they could be on the show at some point too.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe their own fan- fantasies kind of come true that, "If they can do it, we can do it too".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Because isn't there a new one coming up -- something about they're taking the people out of the TV and onto the beach --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in paradise somewhere.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yes. [LAUGH] So -- it's like -- I guess you -- you call in and so long as you're one of the beautiful people you can go.
L:  Oh.
R:  But I'm --
L:  Hadn't heard about that one.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I don't think it's come out yet, but I've seen -- just commercials on TV about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But -- like the ones like The Bachelorette and Who --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Wants To Marry A Millionaire? and all that, that's so phoney to me.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I just couldn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- even get into any of it.
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I like the -- like Star Search and those kinds of things, but I don't know if that's really considered reality TV.  I think it's more like the Survivor's or Love Island or those kind of things.  But --
L:  Yeah. [NOISE] Ah, it seems -- it seems also like people are just kind of [MN] looking for something outside themselves to be entertaining and you know it's -- it -- it just seems that [SIGH] TV is more for just, "Let's sit there and veg out" instead of "Let's learn something". [NOISE]
R:  That's true.
L:  You know?  We -- we tend to watch [NOISE] -- I really like the history channel and, um [NOISE] -- um, A and E and that kind of thing.  It's either artistic or educational and I just am not interested in seeing, you know, a bunch of people, you know, arguing or trying to figure out who's more attractive or whatever.  It just seems kind of goofy and very shallow.
R:  But true.
L:  But it's mindless [NOISE] and it's -- it's, ah, easy to watch, I guess, if you've had a long day and doesn't cost a lot of money. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's true.  I mean, I personally prefer to come home and watch Jeopardy, that gets my mind off everything else.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then I'm learning something and I guess if people don't really wanna learn anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what they turn to. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I think that's true.
R:  So ...
L:  Which ones do you watch?
R:  Um, you know, I've watched little pieces of lots of them, but [SIGH] it's like I like the Star Search kind of thing, American Idol, that kind of stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- which -- it's more a talent show than the reality TV kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I know I've got brothers and sisters who -- especially my sisters who were really involved with Survivor's and stuff and can talk about, "Oh, well Jo[?] said this and she did --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- that" and it's like it's a soap opera or something anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um -- and everybody knows what everybody else is doing and who they want to win and -- but I've never -- never gotten off --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- into them all that much.  I -- they --
L:  Yeah, you know, that's [NOISE] -- that's a good comparison really, because ah [NOISE] it is kind of the same sorts of, ah, plots of soap operas --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's kind of made it more acceptable to have -- to get a glimpse into other people's lives, even if it might not really be real.
R:  Mhm.  And say, "Oh my, do you they really live like that --"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  "-- if I was a millionaire?".
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Well, you know, I actually do like -- like The Osborne's.  Only because it's just so [NOISE] odd.
R:  See and I've never, ever watched that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't think I've ever even flipped by it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but then again I like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Six Feet Under. [LAUGH] It's just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so strange.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh. [NOISE]
R:  But ah --
L:  -- but if you don't pay for -- we don't for any extra channels so I haven't ever seen that, but it sure [NOISE] gets a lot of awards.
R:  I love it.  I personally [LAUGH] love it, my husband --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can't stand it.  He's a cop --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and on it there's a gay cop --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he just -- he has to leave the room --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- every time it comes on --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- because he just -- he can't -- he just, nah, it just will not ever -- that would never work. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, but if it -- but again, that's like a soap opera.  It's like who's done what to who this week and who's marrying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and who or who's sleeping with whom?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which is kind of the reality shows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- especially the ones that are getting more and more personal and seeing them in bedrooms and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- stuff.  No --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not for me.
L:  It's -- it's really, ah, a shame, I think, that that's the most of what is there -- there is to offer and [MN] it -- it doesn't really give -- I mean, I'm just -- I'm just glad that I don't have kids older than -- than mine are -- you know, my -- my oldest one's almost three and --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- if they were older, I really wouldn't be wanting them to get the idea that that's the way the world is --
R:  No.
L:  -- and that's the way that people are treating each other. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, no.  I know and it's like -- and every other day we're saying, "Oh no, another reality show" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's just -- you know, we're older and have grandkids that old, but um, even still, I wouldn't -- definitely not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- let the grandkids sit and watch that kind of stuff, even if they were over playing or whatever, the TV was off --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so.  No, I don't think it's good for -- mainly -- anybody except the sponsors and whoever's getting the million -- the million dollars at the end.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  It's like For Love Or Money --
L:  That's right, whoever gets the money.  Yeah.
R:  -- is that a thing to teach your kids?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's one or the other, you can either have love or you can have their money?
L:  No.
R:  Nah, not a good thing I don't think, so. [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  Anyway, [NOISE] I think we've beat that to death.
L:  I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  So, where are you at?
L:  I'm in, ah -- outside of Kansas City.
R:  Oh, Kansas City?  Oh, okay.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  I'm actually getting a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a puppy next month from Saint Louis --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and I'm in California. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, it's -- it's a ways.  I've got, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my mom's in Kansas --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um -- but she's in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- near Manhattan.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, it's a couple of hours away from you, but [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it seems like we're in Kansas City ever co- -- every other six months, just to go see my mom.  She's getting old and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- so we try to go see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- her as much as we can.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  But I know she doesn't watch reality TV either.  She thinks it's insane. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  She's funny.  But um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Anyway ...  Okay, so how long have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you been doing --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the talking on the telephone stuff?
L:  Um, I think this is -- it -- actually, probably for a couple of months, I think this is like my third or fourth call maybe.
R:  Okay.  Yeah, me too.  It's like I've been on vacation and in and out and half the time they call and my husband's here and he just gives me that look like, "What are you doing on the phone?" and --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  -- so sometimes it's very hard to do.
L:  Yeah, well it's like, you know, my husband asked me who I was talking to and I said, "I have no idea".
R:  I know it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  It's like it's just a -- yeah, it's a voice --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- on the phone.  It's like, "How can you talk that long to who -- somebody you don't know?".  I'm like, "I don't know --
L:  [NOISE] Mm.
R:  "-- because we have a topic".
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  "We're talking -- we're talking about reality shows".
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  So -- okay.
L:  Mm. [MN] So, do you have a vacation planned or just coming to Manhattan?
R:  Actually we just got back from, um, Hawaii.
L:  Oh, wow. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, we were in Maui for nine days --
L:  [NOISE] Wow.
R:  -- and, um -- so, that was -- that was nice and we had -- um, we've got timeshare --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and we were able to get a three bedroom condo --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so we took my best girlfriend and her husband and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then my husband's sister, so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We had a nice time.
L:  [MN] That's such a beautiful place.
R:  Oh, it's gorgeous.  Have you ever been there?
L:  Yeah, um -- yeah, we [NOISE] went to the big island a couple of years ago --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I actually had to go there for work.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, my husband went with me and, ah, we were just there for [inaudible] long weekend.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was -- was the first time, but [NOISE] oh, it was just marvelous.
R:  Oh, it's beautiful in the wa- -- just [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we went snorkeling and swimming with the big sea turtles and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it's strange -- and there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were still a couple of whales that were late in migrating and they were on their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] on their way up to, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Alaska.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And this was a [several inaudible words] a mother and a baby that -- they said, "The baby must have birthed late" --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- so it was getting it's strength, because they -- they -- they breed and -- and birth there, right outside of Maui --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- then they go to Alaska and feed and come back the next -- the next year to Maui and have their babies again.  But -- so, we did get to see a couple of whales.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah.  So, it was -- that was nice.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I don't know --
L:  Yeah, I hope we can get back there in a few [NOISE] years.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm sure it's hard with kids but there's still a -- there's a lot of places that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have the childcare centres and stuff too though over there --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but maybe you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, grab a grandparent or something and take em with you.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] there was a lot of that [LAUGH] where we were.  It's like, "Oh no, you stay home with grandma" so.
L:  Wow.  Hm.
R:  You never know.
L:  Mm, unfortunately, [MN] my dad is the only one still alive and [NOISE] --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so they're going to miss out on that whole experience.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, my dad just died last year, so.
L:  Hm.
R:  That's -- that's a toughie --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know we've been lucky that my mom's still around and she's -- oh, she's eighty six this year --
L:  Oh, wow. [NOISE] 
R:  -- so she's -- she's getting up there but she's a feisty old girl.
L:  Mm. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Ah, lives in a very small town and -- and has an acre and gets out there on her little r- riding lawnmower and mows the lawn and does all the stuff herself --
L:  Oh, how funny.
R:  -- on this little [LAUGH] -- this little teeny, tiny white haired lady, so. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  She would definitely not have it any other way.  She'll be out there doing something by the time she keels over and that's the end of her, but [MN] she would never sit down for anything.
