R:  [NOISE] Can you please turn it down? [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE] Hello. [NOISE]
L:  Hi, someone there?
R:  Yes, s- sorry. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Ah --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- I -- I -- I guess -- you want me to start?
L:  Yeah, sure.  Sorry --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there's a lot of noise in the background, I wasn't sure --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- who I was talking to at first.
R:  Um, I like to watch Survivor and The Bachelor and The Bachelorette and I watched, um [SIGH] --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- can't remember the one that was -- um, wh- -- the -- where they mar- -- they were trying to get the guy and he didn't realise at the end that he was going to split the million dollars.  I forget what that --
L:  Was that one of the --
R:  -- one was called.  A -- a -- a --
L:  -- the bachelor versions?  No?
R:  No, it was, um, E- Evan [SIGH] -- Evan was the g- -- Joe Millionaire --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that's the one -- ah, that was the other one too.  And I think -- I think that might be all the ones [NOISE] that I do watch.
L:  [SIGH] [inaudible].
R:  [NOISE] Survivor, Bachelor, Bachelorette.  Yeah, I think [NOISE] that was all of them. [NOISE]
L:  Well, I haven't seen many of those.  Um, I've seen a little bit of Survivor but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, it struck me as, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you weren't able to watch it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- without being able to sort of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- watch the series, I couldn't get a sense of the characters, so it wasn't -- wasn't very interesting, it was sort of nothing, but ...
R:  Right.  Right. [NOISE]
L:  No -- no development over time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so it was a sort of challenge to watch.  Um, I actually ended up watching some of the PBS ones which were really kind of cool.  They've been having these historical reenactments --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um -- and, um -- they -- they had some kind of a -- they got, ah, similar things, you were taking just sort of everyday people --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and putting them in -- in situations they'd never coped with before and, um, you gotta kind -- you got to see people at their -- sort of their best and their worst.
R:  Right.  I nev- --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  -- I never even knew that they were having those. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, um -- yeah, they were, um -- they, um [MN] -- there was one, um, in a Victorian London house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and there was one on the -- in the, um, Montana --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- prairie --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, um, the most recent was a -- was a manor house.  Some people in the UK -- a couple from -- one family got to be the -- the -- the rich folks who owned the family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then there was like a dozen other people who had to be the servants.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] That was -- [LAUGH] that was really astonishing.  Um -- um --
R:  Now, was this all the same show though, but they just did three different settings or was it three different reality -- different shows?
L:  They were three different shows, but --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- I mean, they were sort of all similar.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, it -- I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same producers --
R:  Right.  Oh, wow.
L:  -- [inaudible] --
R:  [inaudible] [NOISE] --
L:  -- but um -- but it really did have a lot in common --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with the kind of stuff that I'd seen on -- on Survivor, for example.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um -- I mean, the -- the -- the -- the, um [SIGH] -- the one difference is there wasn't -- there wasn't sort of the game, there wasn't -- and they weren't all trying to -- they weren't [several inaudible words] psyching each other out.
R:  Right.  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  Um -- um -- but there was the, um -- there was the need to -- to, um, work together and all -- all of our normal social expectations were just kind of all thrown out --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- like when you're stuck out on an island somewhere it doesn't matter that somebody's a -- a scientist and --
R:  [NOISE] [MN]
L:  -- somebody else is -- is a model --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  -- but the question is -- is, you know, um, who can keep their head and not start crying because they're tired and -- and, you know, who knows how to catch fish and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um [MN] that -- that's sort of [inaudible] [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of a --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- nice change, you know, from watching [NOISE] like a comedy or a drama or something --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  It's just kind of different, you know?  And I think what was kind of neat too -- um, I don't think that they did it with [NOISE] any of the other, um -- [NOISE] I think it was The Bachelor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they haven't done it with any of the other ones, but this one, it showed at the very end -- like, I think it was like -- or like an extra show that they did after, you know, we saw who won --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they did little clips on like the clumsiness and stuff and how they re-taped.  Now, see I didn't think that they were doing that, you know?  So, it was kind of more, you know, where they were -- or maybe it was so reality --
L:  It wasn't ...  Yeah.
R:  -- you know what I mean?  And I was like [NOISE] kind of surprised to see that, you know?  That -- or, you know, even if [NOISE] they were doing it -- that -- why all of a sudden would they show us, you know, the -- the out takes, sort of, or, you know, what they had to redo?  So, that was kind of [LAUGH] -- kind of funny to see different stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like that.
L:  This was an interesting comment there --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- to -- to see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it was very [NOISE] interesting and kind of funny too, you know, because it kind of put, you know, some comedy into it, you know?  So you could kind of laugh at the different stuff that, you know -- that they'd -- [NOISE] you know, they've tripped or something, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was stuff like that, but yeah, I really enjoy those reality shows too.  I know my husband he kind of laughs and sometimes -- but he'll sit there and watch em [LAUGH] with me, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] But I don't think that there's any on this summer too, so it's kind of a bummer, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  But you -- yeah, because they are --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- they are [SIGH] -- it -- it -- but ther- -- you're right, there's something about them, because -- um -- well, as you said, because if they're -- the way they're editing them and re-taping bits --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they are kind of packaging em --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- but they're still not packaging em in the way of some kind of standard sitcom --
R:  [COUGH] [MN] Right.
L:  -- or drama is.  Um -- and so, I -- I -- I guess that's what make it so more real --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more like ordinary people.
R:  Sure.  Yeah and I think --
L:  Even if it -- even if it is cleaned up.
R:  Yeah and I think that is what draws more people to it, you know?  If [MN] -- no matter what the profession is, you know, because you're seeing em waking up in bed with no makeup on, you know, sometimes at their worst [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it's kind of ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  As -- as opposed to -- as opposed to so many movies we see where --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] and they wake up like ...
L:  -- you know, like -- it's some- -- it's supposed to be an adventure --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- movie and there's this female heroine and she's been, you know, running from the enemy army for three days and sleeping under a bush --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and she wakes up and she's gorgeous.
R:  Right.  Right [LAUGH] and she got all the makeup on. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- and I guess even if you don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- notice that in a movie at the time, I guess it -- it just reads fake and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- as opposed to watching these -- the actual reality stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- and -- and by golly when somebody falls off a horse --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- they look everybody else who falls --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- off of a horse, as opposed to being some kind of -- yeah, [inaudible].
R:  But I wonder too, with so many different ones out there right now, I mean, what different ideas could they even come up with, you know?  Because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- obviously the Survivor I think was probably the very first, you know, and so other people are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, take it -- like when they did Joe Millionaire, you know, and then I think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think there actually is one now, I take that back, I think there is going -- one going on this summer where the girls are trying to vie for the guy and he doesn't know that one of them are going to get a million dollars or something.  So, that's kind of along the same lines [NOISE] as Joe Millionaire --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but yet had a different twist --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to it and I -- I keep thinking, "What else?" you know, "What could they possibly [LAUGH] come up with next?" you know?  And then -- then Mr Personality, you know, and she ha- -- they all worse the mask --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she had to go by personality.  Now, I -- I only saw maybe one or two shows of that and I just couldn't get into that one.
L:  Some of the stuff is a little creepy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like what was the one where -- ah, Married By America?
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I didn't see that, but just a --
R:  You know, I only watched a couple of those.  Yeah, but that was -- that was kind of different.  Yeah, I don't know ...
L:  And, ah -- and there's -- there's just -- that's -- that's just -- that's just getting -- and -- and then there's, I don't know what category you'd put something like Fear Factor into ...
R:  [MN] I know this awful, but I watch that one. [LAUGH]
L:  I did too.  It's like I couldn't --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's like I couldn't turn it off --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and I just felt like I wanted to go take a bath or something --
R:  I know.
L:  -- just for watching it, not because of, you know, the gross things they were doing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I -- that -- that -- that's the thing that's -- really bugs me about the way some of them --
R:  [COUGH] [MN]
L:  -- some of them are going -- is that they are -- um, there's way too much, um, what's the word, voyeurism --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- about humiliating people?
R:  Right.
L:  Or watching somebody else be mean?
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  I don't know, it reminds me of like, um -- like in -- in junior high when -- you know, if the kids were picking on the -- on the weird kid --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- it's like you're getting to stand there and watch it --
R:  Right and if there's a fight --
L:  -- a- and -- and it's just like--
R:  -- you know, you wouldn't try to stop it --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- you'd stand around it?  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just -- morally, it's really creepy --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] -- I mean, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't -- I don't try to -- try not to take TV like it's anything real but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but -- but yet they're telling us this --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- is reality, right?
R:  [LAUGH] Yep.
L:  And yet we're supposed to just be watching it like we wouldn't if it were actually real.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't -- [inaudible] -- buh.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but they keep --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- coming up with new ones too.  Like, I just -- I really can't imagine what the next one could be, you know?
L:  Well -- I mean, they have people sitting around in a room coming up with, "What can we use to shock and horrify and --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- and titillate ...?" --
R:  Right.
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  And capture, you know, all --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all of America to [LAUGH] watch.
L:  [LAUGH] I suspect lots of us would be -- would happily watch things, um, that would -- they might not be real sort of sexy -- they would make -- [several inaudible words] boring ads --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but they would make really interesting shows [LAUGH] that a lot of us would watch.
R:  Oh, yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Just sort of really every day, ordinary things.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  But ah -- but I guess they wouldn't be, ah -- I don't know, they wouldn't be exciting enough.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You wouldn't wanna actually watch anything that was genuine reality --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- because -- I mean, you've got your own life for that --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- but you'd -- what would you talk about the next day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at work or whatever?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [MN]
L:  [inaudible] -- I -- I guess it's like the soap operas --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- which are -- which are, you know, supposed to be, you know, just for ongoing stories --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but yet that kind of -- that kind [LAUGH] of drama doesn't happen.
R:  Oh, sure.  And, you know, it's funny because with soaps, when everyone's happy, you don't watch it anymore [LAUGH] you know?  There's gotta be, you know -- somebody's doing something [NOISE] to someone, you know, or you're not gon- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean -- because that's boring, you know?  And people don't want to watch that.
L:  So, that's just like, um -- like the Jerry Springer show.
R:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  Like -- like who -- yeah, who would -- -- who would who would watch a family that actually gets along --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- with each other and treats each other properly, but ...
R:  But what kills me is the fact that if you know you're going on Jerry Springer, you know that something negative is coming, you know?  Why would you want [NOISE] to go there and be told something, you know, in front of everybody, for t-
