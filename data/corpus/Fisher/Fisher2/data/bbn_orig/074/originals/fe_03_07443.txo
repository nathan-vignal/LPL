R:  Hello?
L:  Hello, my name's Alice.
R:  Hello, Alice.
L:  And what's yours?
R:  My name's Bradley.
L:  And where are you?
R:  I'm in Minnesota.
L:  Oh, gosh!  I'm in Florida.  [LAUGH]  You're way across the state, uh -- country.  Um, I don't watch reality shows.  How 'bout you?
R:  I don't w- --
L:  You sound young.
R:  -- I don't watch a lotta the reality shows.  The, uh, first, uh, Survivor --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that was on I was in, uh, Europe during that time --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and when I came back I only knew about Survivor was there was some crusty old ex Navy Seal --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and there was a fat naked gay guy.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.
R:  So, with that description ...
L:  You decided you didn't need to watch it?  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't really watch a lot of it.  All I remember was watching a little bit of one episode in where I think the -- the Navy Seal -- wasn't his name Rudy? --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and he just kept mum- mumbling about that -- that damn fruit.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I thought maybe -- 'cause I can tell I'm younger -- considerably older than you are.  So, I thought maybe it was just me because of my age I didn't watch 'em.  So -- but, um, we -- we watched one of 'em and I think it was the first and kinda got hooked --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, I mean, we didn't wanna go anywhere.  We wanted to stay and watch it.  So, I thought no, we don't need this.  [LAUGH]  But some of those others I don't especially like.
R:  Well, my fiancee and I watched, uh, Joe Millionaire.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  That was very interesting.
L:  Now, that we -- we didn't watch.
R:  But ...
L:  Uh, but we live way in the country and get very little television.  So [LAUGH], we -- we -- we can't watch much out here.  But ...
R:  Well, I can understand.  No.  A lotta the so -- so called reality ones just -- I mean, I understand why they're appealing but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  As they're kinda -- you know, it's like a lotta these people -- like the first Survivor, you know, from what I know of friends that enjoy that kinda thing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they say, you know, it -- it -- it was real, but after that very quickly it became people who were trying to start careers as models --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or actors.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They, you know --
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  -- it was a -- a job for them.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they all -- there's so many of 'em, r- right on, and then they were getting more money than we were originally told, each of 'em were.
R:  Yep.
L:  But, uh -- and I'm not a dare devil at all.  I wouldn't do some of these were they have to eat stuff, bugs and ...
R:  Oh, like Fear Factor?
L:  Yeah.  That, uh -- if they told me I'd won the million dollars before I started I still wouldn't do it.  So ...
R:  Well, with Fear Factor I think it started out a lot better, but now it's really just kind of like a grossness.
L:  Right.  Mm.  Yep.  So, well, how's the weather out there?
R:  The weather's all right.  The weather actually got a lot better just recently.
L:  Oh.
R:  It had been raining.
L:   We've had some rain, but it's -- it's pretty hot.  We're in Northern Florida where we don't [COUGH] benefit from any sea breeze.  It's just heat.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, uh, it's -- often though I think people are beginning to get tired of the shows because ...
L:  I think they are too.  They wanna go back to the regular things.  I notice my, uh, sons starting to go back to the old Andy Griffiths shows --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and things like that where they can get the real life [LAUGH] a little bit more.
R:  Yep.  Well, I -- I don't think -- I think the problem with the reality shows is that they're not -- they're not as real anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you know, it's -- it's fake.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, a reality show can happen once or twice and be all right, but like with Survivor when you're on like the fifth or sixth one --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's no longer original and people quote, unquote, know how to play the game and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and there's all the politics and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, even like -- supposedly like the Real World on M.T.V. -- I don't know if you ever saw that.
L:  No.  That I haven't seen.
R:  It -- it gets to be really boring because you start to notice a trend, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like they always have, you know, at least, you know -- a certain demographic, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they've always got one, you know, gay person --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or alternative lifestyle person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They've always got one person who is, you know, really, um, nonconformist --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- outside of the -- the conventional norms.
L:  Yep.  Mhm.  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  So, it, uh -- it ...
L:  I think we need to go back to some of the old, uh -- just stories.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I -- I think -- I think the problem with like the reality shows is that it -- it -- you know how people always complain that, you know, network T.V. shows, you know, are very +formula-matic and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and all that?  The reality shows have become that way because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there's not enough, uh, variety.
L:  Yeah.  Right.  It's the same thing every time.
R:  [NOISE] Well, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It quickly becomes the same thing.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  [COUGH]  Uh, I don't wanna go back to the era when we were seeing nothing but doctor shows or nothing but lawyer shows.
R:  [LAUGH] Well -- well, I don't like the lawyer shows, but I love Law and Order.  That's like my -- one of my favorite shows.
L:  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know why my husband didn't watch that one.  So ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like, uh, Judging Amy and he does not like -- he doesn't like that one at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that's one of the few I watch alone usually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't know if I've ever really seen Judging Amy.
L:  Mm.  I like C.S.I.
R:  C.S.I. is interesting.
L:  Lately it's gotten gory.
R:  Well, yeah.  I've heard that.
L:  It's showing a little too much for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, with the reality shows show they ...  The other day I was listening on the radio and they said, you know, oh, these two girls, you know, they won their immunity ch- challenge by stripping down naked or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I was like how -- how's that, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like -- and it was on Survivor.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  It wasn't on Fear Factor.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And I was like how does that help you with survival?
L:  Yeah.
R:  The idea is -- like this is like the extreme Boy Scout camping trip or something.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  [COUGH]
R:  So ...  But it's always kinda -- sometimes you get interesting people on that shows otherwise -- but sometimes, like I said, you get people that seem like they're just -- you know, it's a different --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- different episode, but it's the same --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people.
L:  Same people.  That, um -- there was one girl I know -- remember specifically who was from Knoxville, Tennessee, and, uh, she was down to earth, but she was doing exactly the same thing everybody else was on -- that was on Survivor and, uh, she was just ex- -- ended up just exactly like everybody else.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She was out to win.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean, you know, you don't -- you don't go there for the appeal --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- unless you're like the first season.
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Gee, it sounds interesting.  I'll go to an island for six weeks".
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I -- I mean, the first time around I could -- I could see that maybe -- maybe some of those people did it -- "Hey, this sounds interesting --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- and I've got six weeks worth of vacation", you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  "I might win a million bucks".
L:  Mhm.  But I'll stick with the State lottery.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm not big -- wild on the State Lottos, but ...
L:  No, I'm not either.  They were supposed to help Florida.  So, that's how they were really pushed 'cause this is a Baptist -- Southern Baptist belt --
R:  Yeah.  Well --
L:  -- and, uh, they really pushed it.
R:  -- where I lived in, uh, Missouri growing up they, uh -- the Lotto turned out to be a bad deal for the people too.
L:  Yeah.  Our schools have gone down, down, down.  There's no money for 'em now 'cause they're not getting the lottery and, um [COUGH], it hurt the Florida schools at least.  Uh, but I don't know.
R:  I'm trying to think of any other ones that look interesting.  I think they just said that Mr. Personality -- that ended, but I heard kinda mixed reviews on that.
L:  Yeah.  So did we.
R:  But the -- the new one -- I think it's, what, For Love or Money?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All the girls are play- playing for a million bucks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the guy, you know ...?  I don't know what they told the guy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  "Oh, this is in store for the bachelor".
L:  Oh.  And the one that's gonna -- that's -- to get to marry.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I mean, oh, that's really gonna be a -- a marriage based on, uh, a lot of knowledge of each other.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, you're playing for a million bucks --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and then I understand that, you know, that's not a good idea.
L:  Yep.
R:  I understand with The Bachelor, you know -- or The Bachelorette, I mean --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, it -- at least the idea is that, you know, you're finding your -- you know, your soul mate.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's what I like about Joe Millionaire yeah, they -- they won a million bucks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but they didn't know and -- and plus the fact that they gave, you know, half of it to each one of 'em.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's a lot more fair, I mean ...
L:  Yeah, fairer.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I think it is too.  [COUGH]
R:  Yep.  But, uh, I remember watching one of The Bachelor's and it was the one where the guy was from Springfield, Missouri, and it was down between two girls and one of 'em from New Jersey or something --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that he winding up picking and then the other girl was from like Georgia.  She was a university student --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she seemed like the sweet one.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  The girl from Jersey seemed like the one that was, you know, in it for the money and --
L:  For the money only.  Mhm.  [COUGH]
R:  -- he picked her and everybody was saying like, you know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- this is a big mistake and ...
L:  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, gosh!  I wonder how many of 'em actually get married --
R:  Well ...
L:  -- or stay married. 
R:  Yeah.  The -- the guy from Joe Millionaire didn't marry the, uh -- the girl that he picked.
L:  Oh.  Oh.
R:  Although -- although he did -- he picked the right girl to be honest.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  [COUGH] Yep.
R:  That was that and then let's see, what else?  What else?  What other ones?
L:  What else did they say on there?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  I had a lousy connection and couldn't understand her very well this time.
R:  Oh, say that again.
L:  I had a lousy connection and couldn't understand what all the woman said --
