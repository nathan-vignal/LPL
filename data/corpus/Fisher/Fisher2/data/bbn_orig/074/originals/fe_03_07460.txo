R:  Taylor.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.  M- my name's Dale.
R:  Hi.  I'm Taylor.
L:  It's nice to talk to you.
R:  Nice talking to you too. [MN] [NOISE]
L:  I c- -- I don't think I'm gonna be too much help on this because I don't really watch reality based TV other than the one show, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, and I did watch that quite a bit.  But as far as Survivor and, ah, the rest of them, I -- I really didn't get too involved in that.  But I can understand, to some degree, why -- why people are attracted to those shows because I think they can relate to it much better.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, I think it shows, um, how people, like, react and people kind of get rid of their fears 'cause they're not left by themselves but I really didn't get into Survivor +either -- either but I don't really watch that many reality based TV shows.  I don't know -- just don't --
L:  Well, we're in the s- -- we're in the same boat. [MN]
R:  I like Real World on MTV though.  That's a really cool one.
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause I -- I don't know, I just like following the characters.  It was like a soap opera but at the same time you were getting stuck in weird situations.  So, that's kinda fun. [MN]
L:  Yeah.  And it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think what's, ah, interesting too is that these people aren't paid actors.  These are --
R:  Right.
L:  -- these are normal people like -- like you or I could be on these shows --
R:  [NOISE] [inaudible] 
L:  -- and I think that's what kind of makes it interesting --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- too.  You wanna see how a real person, quote unquote, reacts in -- in these situations instead of an actor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you'd like to s- -- you'd like to see the common Joe win a million dollars.  I mean, i- it's a dream that everybody has.  They're gonna -- they're gonna get on that program and they're -- and they're gonna answer these questions so you like to see these average Joes do well.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Right 'cause it gives people hope --
L:  Yeah, that --
R:  -- for themselves. [MN]
L:  -- there you go.  Yeah, it does.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Sounds like you got kids running around in the background.
R:  Oh, um, me, my brother and my sister and my friend are playing Vice City.
L:  Oh.  [MN]
R:  That is the course cable, my God.
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, I don't think we can talk for ten minutes about that.  That's just kinda --
L:  It'd be a lot easier to talk about it if I actually watched more of this, like, Survivor series and things like that but, ah, ah, the reason I didn't get involved in that is because I think one network found a way to increase ratings without a heavy budget.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you don't have --
L:  Here they f- -- they found a formula that they can produce a program for minimal cost and get tremendous ratings and it -- all it does is boost their bottom line.
R:  Right.
L:  And there's nothing wrong with that [MN] but, to me, it's all contrived and I -- I just didn't want to be a part of it.
R:  [MN]
L:  But I can understand the fascination with --
R:  Like Fear Factor.  That's a really good one.
L:  Yeah, y- you know, people wanna see how they would react in certain situations, so -- [MN] rather than an actor, so ... it- it's interesting to a point.
R:  They are, like, they -- I don't know, they just, like, really started getting popular, like, what, in the past two years when --
L:  Oh, yeah, and see, as soon as one network --
R:  Started 'em all these others are doing --
L:  Oh, for sure.  I mean, [MN] --
R:  Like --
L:  -- it's even on satellite TV stations now, like F- -- like Fame, like, ah, [MN] --
R:  Oh, there's one called Protagonista.  It's in Me- -- it's in Spanish and it's basically a complete knockoff of Fear Factor and it's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- one night on the TV, I was watching round at a friend's house, I was like, hmm, [MN], yeah, but [MN] I think they're --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- really good if you have -- if you can actually sit there and get into them but otherwise, I don't know, they're kinda -- some of them the f- -- when they first came out they were really good but now the -- the more they're making them, the more they're just getting -- running out of ideas.  Like, that Doggy Dog thing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that was just retarded.
L:  When this -- this is -- this is almost like a fad in TV now, I think.
R:  Yeah, like --
L:  T- t- -- [COUGH]
R:  -- the family shows were one time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now reality TV and --
L:  Yeah.  And I think --
R:  You never know what's next.
L:  -- ten, fifteen years from now you're gonna look back on it and say, "That's what we used to watch".
R:  And then our kids are gonna make fun us -- fun of us for it.
L:  Yeah, because they're gonna be watching something else.
R:  Exactly.
L:  There -- there might even be, ah, something in the future where the viewer can actually be a part of the program, [MN] you know, introduce themselves right into the -- the storyline somehow.
R:  Yeah, like those [inaudible].
L:  You just don't know -- you just don't know what technology has in store for -- for, ah, home entertainment.  A- anything's possible. [MN]
R:  Good point.  [MN]
L:  So, you're not watching television though?
R:  Right now?  No, I walked out of the room.  I couldn't hear anything and I turned my --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- TV off because my cell phone's messed up and I can barely hear.  I don't know what's on.  I think the weather channel's on.  I watch that all the time.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah, I'm going to be a meteorologist.  That's why.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.  Where are you from right now?
R:  Texas.
L:  [MN] [LIPSMACK] You know, my, ah, previous call I was talking to someone from Texas.  I'm fr- --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I'm from Florida.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Down near Orlando. [MN]
R:  I used to live in Boca Raton.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's nice.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Very nice.
R:  [MN] So, how did you find out about this on line thing?
L:  Actually, ah, my wife is involved in the computer and [MN], ah, she ran across this Fisher funded --
R:  Yeah, my --
L:  -- telephone [MN] conversations and things.  I d- -- I -- and, ah, I -- I just signed up with her and --
R:  [MN] My --
L:  -- we- we've both been doing it.
R:  Oh, my fiance lives in California and he's one of those Ebay Internet freaks and --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- so, he was, like, "Hey, do this", 'cause I need money right now.  [MN]
L:  Oh, yeah --
R:  So, like, mm.
L:  -- if you're going to school, for sure.
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm -- [MN] --
L:  You always need spending money.
R:  Yeah, I'm at SMU right now.  Yep.
L:  So, anyways, I don't think I could, ah --
R:  Talk ten minutes about reality TV?
L:  [LAUGH] Really.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  O- other, you know, my -- my family watches it almost religiously.  I, for some reason, I just haven't [MN] gotten into it other than the --
R:  I don't have the time for it.
L:  -- other than the millionaire show.  I do -- I did watch that and it's -- and it's still on [MN] but it's not nearly as popular as it was before with --
R:  Like the one with Monica Lewinsky.
L:  Oh, God.
R:  The new one.
L:  When they start introducing celebrities to play for, ah, charities and things like -- it seems like every game show went that route --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's -- it's dying is what it's doing.  It's losing its audience and it won't be on TV much longer and I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like I was saying before --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I think the Survivor series and things like that [MN], ah, where you take the average Joe off the street and put him in front of a TV and make him perform --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is going to run its course too, but it does -- I think it has some, ah, [MN] it has some audience appeal obviously.
R:  Hm.
L:  Everybody wants to see the guy win the million dollars.  Somebody's gonna win.  That's the thing about it.  Somebody's gonna win and everybody's got their favorite.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I'm not really big on TV, period.  [inaudible] really into my gaming.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I -- I agree with you on the fact that it's just dying out.  
L:  Are you into gaming on TV?
R:  Gaming on line.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Something gaming. [MN] Like [inaudible] and stuff like that.
L:  [MN] So, you're on the computer a lot?
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  So's my wife.
R:  Nothing better to do.
L:  [LAUGH] Nothing on TV anyways, I have to agree with that.
R:  [LAUGH] And what it is, is just the repeats of what was on, like, twenty minutes ago.
L:  So, how'd you get involved in meteorology?
R:  Um, I don't know, ever since I was little I've just always been weird like that.  [MN] As you can see, I'm weird.
L:  But y- -- are you a storm chaser?
R:  No.  I'm just into studying the weather --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and predicting forecasts but I would never chase a storm because where I'm at right now --
L:  Yeah, you get a lot of, ah, tornadoes probably in your area.
R:  Oh, r- right now we've been having thunderstorm after thunderstorm and it's --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- freaky.  [NOISE] Ah, typing with one hand is harder than I thought.
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN] Yep.  So, this is through, what, Penn State University?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Is this through Penn State University or what?
L:  You know, I d- -- I don't know.  I know it's university funded.
