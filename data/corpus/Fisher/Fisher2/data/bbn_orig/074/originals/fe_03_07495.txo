R:  Hi, I'm Stephanie.
L:  Hi, I'm Sean.  Where are you, Stephanie?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm in Boston, Massachusetts.  Where are you?
L:  Oh, I'm down in Washington, DC.
R:  Oh, very nice. [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  You sound like you have a New York accent, though.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I've lived all over the place so that might have something to do with it. [LAUGH]
L:  I can hear it.
R:  I lived in California for a year but, I don't know if that has anything to do with it. [LAUGH] Um, so how's Washington?  Is it nice there? [LAUGH]
L:  It's, uh -- it's kinda overcast but it's fine.
R:  [NOISE] Is it really?  We've had a pretty, uh, rough winter here so far. [LAUGH]
L:  I'd expect so.
R:  I mean -- I mean a rough spring.  Oh, what am I talking about?  It's been raining a lot and stuff, um --
L:  Yeah, we've had the same kind of weather.
R:  You have, really? [LAUGH]
L:  It's been humid, too.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah, it -- it definitely has.  Well, our weather's really strange because it can be really hot one second and then, like, freezing two seconds later so, um, you know, you never what you're going to get around here. [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  So, um, what is your favorite holiday? [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, jeeze. [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, my favorite holiday?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm going to go with something like, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess Fathers' Day.
R:  Oh, that's a nice one, especially since today is.  Why is that?
L:  Oh, I have great admiration for my father.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  So, uh --
R:  He's just a great person and a great father?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] That's good.
L:  Yeah, pretty much.  I enjoy, um, honoring him in some way.
R:  Okay, what did you do for Fathers' Day today?
L:  Just went out to dinner.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  Just hanging out.
R:  That's nice.  You have brothers and sisters?
L:  Yeah, I have a little sister.
R:  Okay, that's very nice. [NOISE]
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Your father must have had a good day, then, having both of his kids around. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think he likes it and I'm sure some day I'll gain the same pleasure out of having my family around which is really --
R:  Right.
L:  Well, you know, it's funny, I even read something that fathers get -- people spend like thirteen percent less on Fathers' Day and something like thirty five percent less greeting cards as opposed to Mothers' Day.
R:  Really?  I wonder why that is?  Maybe it has -- not -- a lot of fathers are absent in -- like in people's families.
L:  [MN]
R:  You know, it's in -- you know, it's more common to hear about, like, um, single parent families where the mother is around and the father's not, than the other way round.
L:  Maybe --
R:  So that might have something to do with it.
L:  -- I don't know, kinda -- Chris Rock says like --
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH]
L:  -- people just have more admiration for mothers.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "Cause, like, nobody's ever like, "Daddy, thanks for this roof over my head --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- thanks for the food on the table, damn, Daddy, I really like this hot water". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That is -- that is true but, um, there are times like, you know, at least you're an exception and I am, too, in the sense that I really appreciate my father a lot and the things that's he done so --
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, I try to -- I try to spend equal, I try to make it equal and I enjoy both of those holidays the same because I love both my parents and I -- I admire both of them so [NOISE] um --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's a good --
L:  [MN]
R:  It's good that -- that we take a day to celebrate that. [LAUGH]
L:  What's your favorite holiday?
R:  Um, well I really like the fourth of July and the reason for that is that basically I feel like it's a day where nothing's really expected of you except to be with people, um, that you enjoy being with and care about and just basically have a good time.  Um, like I feel like there's a lot of holidays where there's a lot of pressure to have a really, you know, great, like, brilliant time and if you don't it kinda feels like a letdown.  Like, you know, if you don't have great plans for like --
L:  New Year's.
R:  -- New Year's Eve or something like that then you kinda feel like you're a loser and you have no life but I mean, fourth of July --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's just kind of like a day where you can do whatever you want, it's acceptable.  You know, you can just go out to bars with your friends or you can away for the weekend or you don't really have to do much and, you know, nobody really thinks anything of it.  So [LIPSMACK] that's why I really like the fourth of July.  And I like summer and I like fireworks so, [LAUGH] uh, you know, [LAUGH] that has a lot to do with it, too.
L:  That's a well thought out answer.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you really --
R:  Well, it's the second time I did this question today. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  Do you really, um [LIPSMACK] feel the pressure of other holidays?
R:  Um, I do, I mean there's -- there's -- you know, there are certain holidays, you know, like Valentine's Day where if you don't have a -- a significant other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, you know, you kinda feel like a little bit shafted on that day.  Um, you know, Christmas, if there's ever, like, a problem going on in your family or, you know, just if you don't have a big family, if you're Jewish, something like that, you know, you kinda feel -- kinda feel the heat if you don't have, like, a really spectacular day.  So I really just prefer a day where there's not a lot of pressure and you can kinda just enjoy --
L: [MN]
R:  -- being with people that you care about. [LIPSMACK] So that's why I like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the fourth of July. [SIGH]
L:  Do you --
R:  Um, do you like the fourth of July?
L:  It's all right, fireworks are cool.  But are you the kind of person --
R:  So, what do you normally do?
L:  Are you the kind of person who doesn't enjoy being asked what do you do because it forces you to reflect and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- give an honest answer?
R:  Am I that kind of person? [LAUGH] It depends on what context it's being asked in. [LAUGH] Um, no, you know, I -- I -- I don't really have a problem with that question [LAUGH]. I'm -- I'm temping right now so I guess at this point in time it's not a question that I really enjoy answering but no, I'm not -- I'm not really that type of person.  You know, it -- it's definitely a good segue into conversation and it's a big part of who we are, the job we have, um, so I don't really mind being asked that. [LAUGH]
L:  But it's the -- it's the same kind of scenario where on major holidays or holidays where you're forced to have pressure and at the same time you're asked, "What do you do?", you're forced to give a sober and honest reflection and account and maybe you don't like the answer as much as, uh, -- you know, may -- maybe that's the issue with -- with the pressure.  Know what I mean?
R:  Yeah, um, yeah, I never -- I never really thought about it that much. [LAUGH] That could have a little bit to do with it.
L:  It's a double edged sword.
R:  Well, you know, you just made me think a lot deeper than I was planning to do today [LAUGH] but, I mean, that -- that's definitely true.  I mean, it -- on holidays like Christmas --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, you know, Easter and things like that, you know, when you -- it -- it is a big reflection of, like, who you are and what you believe in and, um, you know -- and your family and what's going on in your family and that sort of thing.  So that definitely could have something to do with it [LAUGH].
L:  So, if you could --
R:  So, if you could create a holiday, what would it be?
L:  I'll toss that question back to you.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Um, I -- I guess it'd probably just be like some sort of celebration of life.  Like I feel like in other countries they celebrate being alive and happy and healthy a lot more than we do in America.  So, you know, just a day where you could kind of like reflect on, you know -- on being happy and being healthy and being with people you care about.  You know, the same reasons why I like the fourth of July.  Just something like that.  Like, um, I lived in California for a year and I just noticed that people in Mexico, you know, no matter what kind of job they had and, you know, what sort of house they lived in, that sort of thing, they always just seemed to, sort of, have more of a joy of daily life and, I mean, I always -- I kind envied a lot of them for that.  Um, you know, their whole outlook just seemed to be a lot brighter than a lot of people I know.  So, I think it's great to get -- it's definitely a cultural thing.  A lot of Europeans are the same way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, um, but my holiday would just be some sort of celebration of life, I guess, and it would take place in the summer.
L:  So it would like Life Day and like --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah, like, International, like, Happiness Day or something like that.
L:  International Happiness Day.
R:  And you definitely get the day off of work. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  [NOISE] [LAUGH] How --
L:  And I don't --
R:  And how about you?
L:  [SIGH] Um, I would go with something like, um -- [LIPSMACK] I would go with Comedy Day.
R:  Okay, why?
L:  Yeah, definitely.  It's, uh -- it's such an under appreciated aspect of life.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's so important to life.
R:  [NOISE] Okay, so what would you do on Comedy Day?
L:  I think people should be forced to go sit in movie theaters and stand up comedy pavilions.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not only is comedy good for the heart but good for the soul.
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, I -- it -- it definitely is.  You know, it's -- we -- uh, a -- a day when you laugh a lot is like a much better day than a day when you don't laugh at all so I guess -- I guess that's true.  Comedy's a -- it's definitely important in people's overall happiness.  So you think everyone should go see a standup comic on that day?
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Or be -- or be -- or be forced to do some sort of mock sketch --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where they're forced to embarrass themselves.
R:  [MN]
L:  People take themselves a way too seriously.
R:  Right, and life is too short to be doing that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Great.
L:  In my humble opinion.
R:  Yeah, well I think that's definitely a great holiday.  So how long have you been participating in the study for?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Three days.
R:  Three days?
L:  How about yourself.
R:  [MN] Do -- do they cap you at a certain number of phone calls or can you make as many as you want?
L:  I'm curious about that.  I read something that said you may be called for up -- for thirty six to forty times but they'd cap you at three or something.  I don't know.  This is my second.
R:  They'd cap you at three a day?
L:  I don't know.  How many have you done?
R:  This is my second one.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Uh, this is my second one today.
L:  Oh, it might be three overall.
R:  So, you mean they -- you mean they cap you at three total or like three ...?
L:  I'm not sure, I haven't --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- looked at it too closely.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] It's definitely an interesting study. [LAUGH]
L:  What -- what, uh --
R:  I'm like -- I'm like --
L:  I don't know, what other holiday would you create?
R:  What other holiday would I create? [LIPSMACK] That's a good question.  Wow, I had to think about it once, now I got to think about it again, huh.  Um, [LIPSMACK] you know, [LAUGH] I don't really know.  How about you?
L:  If, uh -- if not Comedy Day, um, what about nationalizing some sort of environmental holiday?
R:  Yeah, like -- well, I mean, there's already Earth Day but, you know, we could -- they -- if they tried to make it, um, you know, broad --
L:  Like a federal holiday or something.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe -- maybe a day to celebrate immigration, to -- to, like, sit back and realize, like, why we're all in this country and to celebrate -- just because there's been so much, um, you know, bad press about the United -- United States abroad and that sort of thing, maybe just a holiday where we could, like, sit back and appreciate everybody who, like, makes this country what it is.  Like, everyone -- everybody who came over here to start a new life as like most --
