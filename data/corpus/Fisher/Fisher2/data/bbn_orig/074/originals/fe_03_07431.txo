L:  Hello, my name is Lisa.
R:  Hi, my name's Dom.
L:  Oh, hi.  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about reality television.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that's interesting 'cause I talk about reality television all the time.  Um, my friend and I watch it a lot, um [SIGH], uh, like everything from like Elimidate and, um [LIPSMACK] ...  I don't really watch Survivor much because it's on right when I have to be getting the kids a bath and getting them in bed.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like the -- the stuff later in the evening [SIGH], um, Elimidate.  Isn't it like, uh, Shipmates?  Things where they like follow the people around, talk to 'em, um ...
R:  Mostly my girlfriend watches that sorta stuff.  Uh, I haven't -- I haven't really watch- -- I mean, I catch a few episodes now and then, but mostly those shows tend to drive me insane.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Mostly because I -- I think that at times they're just so far removed from reality --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that it just seems incredibly out of place when I watch them.
L:  They call it reality T.V., but it is edited, it's not live reality --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think it's -- and -- and I think what we're watching is, um -- the -- what the editor wants us to see, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- like on the dating shows.  I think it makes -- it's -- yeah, it's not [LAUGH] -- they -- they call it reality T.V., but I don't really think that's reality.
R:  It's -- it's hyper reality.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's exactly what they want you to see.  I really -- I guess that's the one thing that bugs me the most about it.
L:  Yeah.  I never -- like, Big Brother, I -- I hear about that and I'd see it, uh, like on the M.S.N. website and I'd, you know, hear people talking about it and I never -- I watched just like maybe three episodes.  I don't know how many years it's been on or how many seasons --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but that was just -- to me I thought that was -- I don't know.  It -- it wasn't like Survivor --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, there wasn't, you know, the nice scenic backdrops and wild animals and stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So, that was kinda boring.
R:  Yeah.  I -- well, to be honest up until, uh, like about a month ago I haven't watched T.V. for close to two years.
L:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
R:  Just, uh -- I don't know.  It -- it really got to me after a while.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The -- the -- how commercial television has become and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know -- it just -- it was very rough for me for a while there.  But -- but once I, uh, got a new apartment with my girlfriend though we ended up, uh, again, you know, real basic cable and she's been watching that at night 'cause it's really the only thing on T.V. anymore.
L:  That's true.
R:  It's just -- it's become so easy for them to make these shows and they turn 'em out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so quickly that, you know, it's just everywhere you turn, no matter what channel you're on, um ...
L:  Right.  Tere's no high paid actors.
R:  Mhm.
L:  No -- somebody's not showing up and having to postpone, um, filming and ...
R:  I -- I think that a lotta those shows like Elimidate especially they -- they just have a tendency to bring out the worst in people.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- well, they always pick like not your typical person.  If you took, um, a million Americans and took the -- the median of what the average person looks like dating that's not what they look like --
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  -- and -- and I don't know.
R:  And it's definitely just there to -- to cater to people -- I don't know.  I think they're -- they're fantasies more than anything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They wanna -- they wanna present something that, uh -- a nice neat package for everybody to, uh -- to consume.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  And everything all wraps up in one thirty minute episode [LAUGH], you know, uh, no emotional hang ups, there's no -- everything is just kinda like the Brady Bunch, it's all -- not like the Brady Bunch -- but everything -- everything's resolved and everyone gives their little comment at the end and it's thirty seconds in a neat little package.  It's not --
R:  Yeah. My, uh --
L:  -- not reality.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my girlfriend's really gotten in this new -- new show.  What is it?  For Love or Money or something where they're -- where they're dating a guy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they're supposed to win a million bucks or something like that.
L:  I think that's on around my kids' bedtime.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I don't -- I don't get to -- you know, those ones I just -- you know, if I -- if the T.V.'s on -- I -- I don't -- I -- I have four little girls and the oldest one's ten and I don't them seeing women acting that way or even --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in The Bachelor I don't want some -- them seeing some guy kissing twenty different women and then marrying one of them all within like a few months.  That really [LAUGH] -- I thought that is really strange, The Bachelor.
R:  Yeah.  I think that a lotta the times they don't really think about the implications these shows are gonna have on -- on the younger --
L:  No.
R:  -- people watching them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, what ...
L:  Uh, an -- an adult can see and, um -- 'cause -- well, I guess if you weren't raised seeing that you don't think that that's normal and -- and an adult it's like that's -- it's like the shock value, like when H.B.O. started playing those really bizarre explicit shows it's like oh, my gosh, I can't believe they're playing that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But if you grow up watching that what are you gonna use to shock that generation?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, what's gonna shock, you know, kids twenty years from now when -- when they grew up watching the -- the stuff that's on now?
R:  Mhm.  Well, I wouldn't really worry too much about the shock value of it.  I'm more concerned about, uh, the socialization, you know, how -- if they see people like grown adults socializing in -- in manners like they see on Elimidate where, you know, the first five minutes of the show they're practically making out with the guy and on top of him --
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, what -- what kind of message does that send?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  I -- I guess -- I don't know.  I don't really like Elimidate.  I don't know why that popped out of my mouth 'cause I think when I hear reality T.V. I think that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I've seen it, but I wouldn't say [LAUGH] -- I wouldn't say I enjoy it.  But I guess I'm a little catty and I like to pick apart, um, you know, like -- I like to say well, that's not real.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is so sick.  Or I'll see someone and, uh -- my husband watches it and that's usually when I see it's on and I'll say, "Oh, she'd be a great mother, huh?" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, almost trying to bring reality to the situation not, um --
R:  I ...
L:  -- or I'll say, "Jeeze, I wonder what she'll look like in ten years?" or ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I'm -- I'm catty.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think a lotta people are like that though.  I mean, uh, a lotta people like to do that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think, you know, it's just human nature to do that sort of thing when -- when you're presented with such an awkward and unnatural set up.
L:  Yeah.  Sort of voyeuristic too, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, oh, they -- they know they're being watched by millions, or hundreds, or thousands of Americans.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I would hope it's only hundreds, but it's probably millions.
R:  Um, I -- I often just wonder about how much of it is actually set up.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I know some of it's convenient to edit together to make it look like, you know, this -- this happened or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- this happened.  But I'm sure some of it has -- has been planned.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I would agree, uh, or even prompted.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, well, let's see if we can get everyone into bikini tops, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- in the next ten minutes and if they'll rip off their clothes it makes it look like these women just walk around ripping off their clothes [LAUGH] or something, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm sure a little bit of it -- a l- -- you know, most of its -- is -- all -- all of its edited in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a lot of its probably prompted and most of its not real.  [LAUGH]
R:  Definitely.  But, uh, I'm not sure.  There -- there are a few shows that I really -- I don't -- I can't -- I can't -- I just can't watch 'em.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's just -- they're too bad.  They're kinda like a car crash where you don't wanna look, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at the same time you can't look away.
L:  Right.
R:  It's like what -- what were these people thinking when they got on these shows?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, you know, why are they acting like this?  But ...
L:  I know.  I, um, don't know if ten years ago I would've -- maybe I would've -- I would've -- probably when I was younger I would've though oh, wow, this is like -- I'm -- I'm not -- I guess your fifteen minutes in fame, you know, just being on there and having everyone see you and -- but I just would not want to be -- have all these little pop ups, you know, things, um, like bad remarks made about me on T.V. --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they just -- you know, whoever the, um [LIPSMACK] -- I don't know what you would call it -- not really an emcee, but whoever is hosting the show, they always have something clever to say about whatever happened and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just would not wanna be tore up that way.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I -- I would probably consider like Fear Factor another one of those reality shows where they like dare people to do stuff, um, for money and I often wonder like what goes through these peoples' heads when they -- when they're going through, you know, these tests or trials, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  Some of 'em I can watch and honestly say okay, yeah, I could -- I would probably do that for money.  But some of 'em are just -- it's so far out there that it's like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- how big a fool do you really wanna make of yourself on national television for this money?
L:  Even the Fear Factor I, uh -- yeah, I guess it's -- when I've seen that and I've seen -- I've -- none of them I was faithful and seen every show, every episode, but when I'd tune in and I'd see someone going across the rope in my mind I'd think could I physically do that, um, you know, like between two buildings and, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or -- or -- and I guess that's what they want you to think.  [NOISE]  But, um, I wouldn't lay down in a bed of snakes or with the rats or the worms or eat bugs.
R:  No.  No.  That's -- that's a bit much I think.
L:  I know.  I wonder if -- if -- if it -- if Americans will ever get tired of seeing people chewing up insects?
R:  [MN]
L:  A lot of the [LAUGH] -- a lot of -- I guess Survivor always had that on every episode and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then there was the Celebrity -- Get Me Out of Here, I'm a Celebrity and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a couple of the other shows they just did the most disgusting things.  I don't know if on Fear Factor they had to eat bugs, but I knew that they were around them.
R:  Yeah.  They've -- they've eaten a wide variety of disgusting things, uh ...
L:  Ow.  You would think that would get boring.
R:  Um, apparently not.  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, the ratings are all good for these shows and ...
L:  I wonder if emergency rooms are full of people sick --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] you know, their friends dared 'em to eat bugs or something.
R:  Contestants all over the country.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I -- I don't know.  I just -- I can't get into 'em.  I -- I watch 'em once in a while.  If my girlfriend is watching I'll like stop in the living room for ten or fifteen minutes while she's watching and I just can't -- can't imagine like putting myself on display like that.
L:  Right.  And -- and I just -- yeah, I can im- --
