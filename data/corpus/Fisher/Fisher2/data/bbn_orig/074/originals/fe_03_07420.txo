R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Kathy[?].
R:  My name is Rachel[?].
L:  Hi, Rachel.
R:  Hi.
L:  I guess we're supposed [LAUGH] to talk about personal habits --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and which one we think is the worst.  Um -- and -- um, she talked so fast to be honest, I'm not sure what -- all she said.
R:  [MN]
L:  But I know she was talking about gossiping and I h- honestly think that's the worst.
R: Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well --
L:  I'll tell you why --
R:  Shoot.
L:  I come from a small town in Pennsylvania and that's the big deal there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  So, I really hate that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's destructive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Very destructive and it -- it -- it creates a lot of problems for a lot of people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what do you think is the worst of the ones that she said?
R:  Um -- well, she mentioned about -- a good ten.  She mentioned smoking, gossiping, um, overeating, drinking too much caffeine, um --
L:  Not exercising was one.
R:  -- not exercising.
L:  [MN]
R:  I personally feel smoking is.
L:  What did you say?
R:  Smoking.
L:  Smoking. [LAUGH] Well, that's --
R:  Yeah, gossip --
L:  I'm a smoker. [LAUGH]
R:  -- gossip would [several inaudible words].  Huh?
L:  I'm a smoker, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  But ah, you know, that -- it -- it is a bad habit.
R:  Well, yeah.  I mean --
L:  It's a bad habit.  My husband has --
R:  -- it's expensive.
L:  My -- my husband used to smoke and he has stopped, so.
R:  Hm.
L:  Ah, and I need to too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It is a very bad habit, but you know, the thing of it is, we started smoking years ago when, you know, you had all this advertisement and there was nothing out about smoking being hazardous to your health and, you know?  I mean, back in my dad's day when he was in the Service, they gave them cigarettes free.
R:  Oh, yeah and they're -- um, what were they Lucky Strikes?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah -- or it had -- mostly non filtered cigarettes, you know?  A lot of -- a lot of those men developed cancer in later years too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- but you know -- um, sadly that's the way it is about a lot of things that -- that we use and we find out years later that it's -- it's a detriment to our health.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you know -- anymore -- everything's a detriment to your health.
R:  I know, that's kind of the irony.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We have all this medical technology now and --
L:  Really.
R:  -- we're just barely keeping up with all the diseases that we have.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we live in California --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and my greatest concern here is the air quality --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I used to live down there.
L:  -- and the water quality.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we have -- ah, we live in southern California and we have, um -- ah, they're -- they're finding now that we have rocket full -- rocket fuel contaminating our water --
R:  Really?
L:  -- which causes a thyroid condition which is something I've developed --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- since we've -- since I've lived here.  Yeah.
R:  How long can you live there?
L:  Ah, I've been here since ninety eight --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, they just actually brought this to the -- out in public about this being in the water in the last couple of years and the thing of it is I'm a big water drinker and we have filters on our water but it doesn't filter that out, so.
R:  Hm.  Wow.
L:  And then of course our -- our air quality here is really, really bad.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, we have, um -- ah, we're lucky if we have three days out of the year that our air quality is not dangerous.
R:  Wow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hm.
L:  So, you know, it's -- it's -- I -- I guess anything like that, you know, pertaining to your health -- of course, the smoking doesn't help it but you know, whenever you're dealing with your water and your air there's no getting away from that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- either, so.
R:  Hm.
L:  But um -- and -- and another thing too I think that's not good is people not exercising.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know.
L:  You know?  I mean, you -- you -- you have to get some kind of exercise.  Eve- even if the exercise you're getting is just your daily chores and doing things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But some -- you know, sometimes some people just get so depressed that the only thing they do all day is sit in their house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they're not getting any exercise that way.
R:  No.
L:  What part of the country do you live in?
R:  Seattle.
L:  Oh, so you get a lot of rain?
R:  Mm, not a whole lot, um, it's -- it's cloudy here a lot --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- more than anything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But um, we've gotten some nice days so far this summer.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's been nice.
L:  All that green.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  Yeah, we're from Pennsylvania so we miss it.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you been to Seattle?
L:  Ah, no, the furthest north we have been has -- has been, um, up to San Francisco.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We -- we drove up the coast highway for a vacation and went to Hurst Castle and, um, to San Francisco, saw Alcatraz --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and went through [inaudible] and come down through Death Valley.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, we had -- we -- we took a couple of weeks.  My husband gets seven weeks vacation --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- so, ah, we took a long trip.
R:  Hm.
L:  But um, I've never been to Washington state.
R:  Oh, you should come up.
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  Yeah, there's lots to see up here.
L:  Well, I've seen pictures --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- ah, beautiful up there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so.  Um, what is your air quality and water like up there?
R:  Um, I think with the water quality, it's better outside of Seattle --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, air quality, I think it's pretty good.  Um, you know, there's always going to be more fog or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or smog, I mean, um, in the city.
L:  In -- in the city, yeah.
R:  Yeah, I still use a [inaudible] filter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But um, I think there's just more regulation up here too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that's why -- it's a bit, um, cleaner up here.
L:  Yeah.  Well, you know, we're -- we live in a desert community so, you know, you have the air quality here that -- you're going to have that bad quality.  One thing about it though, in California you're not allowed to smoke in public.
R:  In public?
L:  No.  Uh-uh.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, in fact we have a couple of towns in California, you're not even allowed to smoke out on the street --
R:  Really?
L:  -- um, [inaudible] -- yeah.  And like here where we live, you can't smoke in any school parking lots, any university parking lots.  You can't smoke in the malls.  You can't smoke at -- ah, at the hospitals or even in their parking lots --
R:  True?
L:  -- um, yeah.  You can't smoke in restaurants or bars, nothing.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  So, they have rea- -- California has really cracked down on that a lot --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- you know?  But um -- yeah, there's some towns that you're not allowed to smoke walking down the street.
R:  Hm.
L:  If you smoke, you have to do it in your own home --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- or in your own car.  Yeah.
R:  Hm.  I think if you smoked in your car that would [LAUGH] be dangerous.  You know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um -- you know -- I mean, they're -- they're really big on that.  They're big on, ah, stopping smoking programs and things like that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but if somebody really wants to smoke --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they're gonna smoke --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- no matter what.  What is kind of weird --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- about the smoking situation, if you go to the hospital and you like walk around the side of the building, all the doctors and nurses are out there in their little area smoking.
R:  That is ironic.
L:  Yeah, really [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because they're the health care professionals. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ah, we were talking about, ah, gossiping before and like I said, we come from a small town in -- in Pennsylvania and believe me, in this small town it's kind of like if you've ever done anything wrong, even got a parking ticket, they never forget it.
R:  Really?
L:  Oh, my it's horrible. [LAUGH]
R:  Hm.
L:  It's really bad. [LAUGH] Yeah.  And it's --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- it's -- it's one of those things that if you bring somebody's name up, you know, they have to bring up their whole entire family and everything that happened in their family in the last ten years.  And it's a real small town, sixty miles north of Harrisburg, so they don't have a lot to do but gossip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Hm.
L:  But ah, [inaudible] --
R:  How long did you live there?
L:  Oh, I was b- -- I was born there and lived there until I was about eighteen, then I moved to North Carolina.  Then I moved back there for a couple of years, then I moved to Delaware.  Lived in Delaware for about nine years and then I moved back for about two years and, um, then
