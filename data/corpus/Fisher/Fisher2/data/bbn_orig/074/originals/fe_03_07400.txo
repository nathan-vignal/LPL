R:  Hi, my name is Liz.
L:  My name is James.
R:  James.  Okay.
L:  Yes, it is.  Oh, where are you located?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Where are you located?
R:  In Central Illinois.
L:  Oh, this is my first time -- second call -- time, you know.
R:  Uh, it's my first time.
L:  Well, you -- they say you gotta call three times --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and it -- I guess on the same day?
R:  No, I think it's different days because there's different topics.
L:  Oh, so, I call this much -- I've been trying today calling.
R:  Well, they let you go through so it's probably okay.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.  What part of Illinois?
R:  Uh, near Peoria.
L:  Oh, I'm in Ocean City, New Jersey.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, what is it we've gotta talk about?
R:  Personal habits.
L:  Oh.
R:  What do you think is worse -- gossiping, smoking, alcohol or caffeine excessive use, not exercising?  I can't remember what the other one was.  She said 'em all very fast.  Did you hear it?
L:  Oh, smoking and alcohol's terrible.
R:  Mm.  Worse than I would -- I would also agree that that would be worse than, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh -- oh, reading was another one and gossiping.  I mean, gossiping hurts a small amount of people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where alcohol or ...
L:  Everybody gossips.
R:  Everybody gossips that's true --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- and it -- and it doesn't have far reaching effects like, um, alcohol use or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- drug use.  I don't think drug use was one of 'em, although I don't think excessive caffeine use is really a problem.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Do you?
L:  Uh, no.  I don't -- I don't drink coffee, but I drink I guess -- soda's kinda caffeine right?  And I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I drink a lot of soda.  [LAUGH]
R:  So do I.  So do I.  So, I would think that, um, perhaps if we took the stuff like alcohol would be the worst one because we both seem to agree with that.  Do you think?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  So ...
L:  And I hate cigarettes.
R:  Oh, yes, cigarette smoking was ...
L:  Do you smoke?
R:  No, I don't.  Do you?
L:  No.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  And that's a problem too.  But probably I would think alcohol use.
L:  Yeah, I guess you're right about that.
R:  Just because -- well, smoking does affect -- can affect other people --
L:  What ...?
R:  -- with second hand smoke.
L:  You're right about that.  Well, when people drink and they get drunk the way they act I hate that.
R:  That's bad.
L:  Yeah, it's so bad.
R:  Yeah.  And driving.
L:  Yeah.  I think they mentioned drugs too.
R:  Did well?  Well, probably drug w-, um ...
L:  That's bad too, eh?
R:  Probably though more people use alcohol than drugs --
L:  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah. 
R:  -- because many people use alcohol socially and can handle it okay.  It's when it's -- it's excessive it's a problem --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or when it affects their life, their job --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the way they handle themselves.  [LIPSMACK]  Drug use is -- I -- I don't know if it's more of a problem and I don't think it is.  I think more people drink than use drugs.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, you're right about that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, marijuana is really bad.  Got a lotta kids around here smoking that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's -- young kids.
R:  Mhm.  Well, it's probably, you know, more popular.
L:  Yeah, and they d- ...
R:  Well, with the younger.
L:  They're drinking too -- a lot too around here.
R:  What?
L:  A lotta them are drinking around -- around here too.
R:  Yeah, that's a high school problem --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes I think probably more so than drugs are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Depending on the community.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I think there's probably more parties where kids go to where there's alcohol than drugs.
L:  And graduation is about to come up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they'll have a party and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they talk about a lot of alcohol.  So ...
R:  Yeah, that's very popular and especially as they get to that age.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And, boy, that's, uh -- ten minutes is a long time to talk about it, but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought, uh, they said half an hour when I called. 
R:  No, just ten minutes.
L:  So, is what it?  We gotta do three calls or ...?
R:  Yeah.  Ten, twenty, thirty minutes.  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, anyway -- so, we'll just go through the other ones.  Not exercising isn't that huge of a problem because that just affects you basically --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- not other people, although -- although in the long term it does affect the health care industry because if you don't exercise you're less likely to be healthy and they keep saying more and more people will be sick as we get older.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't think that's as big a problem as alcohol use.
L:  No, exercise.
R:  And reading, I think reading was one of 'em.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's -- I don't -- although my husband reads and reads and reads.  Aside the fact that you get in your own little world and don't pay attention to what other people are saying, I don't think reading is a problem at all.
L:  Mhm.  No.
R:  And then gossiping hurts you and a few other people, but that's pretty much how the information travels.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- there's nothing really horribly bad about that.
L:  Yeah.  They -- yeah, see right now like I follow things like sports and politics.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know what's going on but, uh ...
R:  So, for reading you mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, you have to read 'cause otherwise you won't know what the -- what's going on in the world.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's probably the healthiest of all those personal habits that they mentioned.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The libraries certainly think so.
L:  Yeah.  Well, hello?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  You say you're in Illinois.
R:  What?
L:  How far are you from Chicago?  Are you near Chicago or St Louis?
R:  Uh, no, it's in the middle basically.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  So ...  [LIPSMACK]
L:  I live in a small town here.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A lotta people come down from Florida and Pennsylvania.
R:  So, do you think out there there's more alcohol use than there's ...?
L:  Well, my town is a dry town.  You can't have it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But what we do they've got Summers Point over the bridge.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We can call up and order, like they come like four times a day for --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like each -- like two liquor -- a liquor store and bar deliver liquor to the people.
R:  I would --
L:  That's how they can get over. 
R:  -- I would think that it's -- since you probably have a lot of, um [LIPSMACK], tourists you'd think maybe summer time would be bad there 'cause you said you are in a ...
L:  Well, they -- yeah, they've still got liq- -- sneak -- bring liquor over, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Bring it in their house --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they gotta -- we gotta a boardwalk, we've got -- you know, it's a resort town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and plus, you know, they -- they get it over.  They got like a couple of private clubs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they can, you know, drink in there.  But, you know, things like that to get over.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  And they call this the greatest family resort.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  You've heard of Oc- Ocean City, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, you've never -- have you been to New Jersey?
R:  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  No.
L:  But, uh, alcohol.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well ...
L:  So, we -- we were supposed to talk about, uh, anything on -- on -- on those topics, right?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Just on the topic of personal habits.  Each day it's a different topic and it was just the topics that they mentioned of drugs, alcohol, smoking, reading, exercise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And can you think of any others that she said?
L:  So, I guess you're gonna make another call or I'll call, you know?  I guess I'll call again after this then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe I'll call tomorrow if I -- if I'm, you know, have to.
R:  Right.
L:  We gotta wait to it -- it ends I guess.
R:  Yes, we do.
L:  And we'll get thirty dollars?
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, well.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, but -- but it's only ten minutes.  I thought it was half an hour.
R:  Well, it's ten, uh -- ten dollars for each ten minute call.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  I get it now.  All right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  You only get three of 'em?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  I was thinking they do this a lot, like I -- like -- you know, other companies.
R:  Right.
L:  But you -- you said you probably did this before?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, this is -- oh, your -- okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.  So, I guess we gotta talk about the topic, uh, alcohol or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- smoking.
R:  Yeah.  I think ...
L:  Where -- where I live you can't smoke nowhere, no restaurants, nowhere really.  Oh, the boardwalk you can't smoke on the boardwalk.  You can't -- they -- they -- you can't -- 'cause they had a few fires in the winter and they banned smoking.  They have one little area, but the board- -- you know?
R:  Right.
L:  But I used to work -- clean the boardwalk at nights and there used to be a lotta cigarette butts.  But you can't smoke on the boardwalk.
R:  So, they're sort of keeping from people -- keeping people from smoking?
L:  Yeah.  End up making a public housing place here, a government public health -- big clean citizen housing like six stories, seven stories, you can't -- you move in and you can't smoke in there.  They stopped that 'cause peop- -- persons were complaining --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they made it a law.  I think it was the second place in New Jersey and you can't sm- smoke where you live at in the high rise.
R:  That's interesting.
L:  That's really, you know ...?
R:  Yeah.  That's interesting.  I wonder, uh -- yeah, yeah.  They'll keep 'em from bringing in alcohol next.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But they -- like I said, they don't -- they're not allowed to drink in this town.  But people, like I said, they deliver it.  They call Summers Point and they come over the bridge and deliver it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's, you know -- and they can't stop that.
R:  No.
