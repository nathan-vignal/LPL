L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]  Hello?  Hi!
L:  Hi, I'm Alex.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I'm Jackie.  How are you?
L:  [SIGH]  Good, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where are you living?
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, I'm in, um, Santana, California.
L:  California?
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  I'm in New York.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh!
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  And do you watch reality TV shows?
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't.
L:  Um, the only one I watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is probably the Real World.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, well I guess that's reality.
L:  Be --
R:  I haven't watched that in a while.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, that's about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the only one I watch 'cause it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's always has, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's always different --
R:  [NOISE]
L: -- and, ah, [SIGH] I like looking at --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the houses that they give them [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  -- to live in 'cause it's really extravagant.
R:  [NOISE]  That's all?  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]  You don't like all the drama on there?  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, the drama gets a little tiring --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- especially --
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  -- when they do reruns over and over and over.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  [NOISE]
L:  Um, but, um, I --
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, that's true.
L:  Well, what do you think about those marriage reality shows?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I think they're kind of ridiculous to me.  [NOISE]
L:  I think so, took.
R:  [NOISE]  I mean, just hearing the commercials I think they going a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- far, you know.  It's like, okay --  [NOISE]
L:  I think most of them do it for the money.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  they get a lot of endorsement and money ... from it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] from winning --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- from being the married couple or something.  Some pe- people just get married and they split it.
R:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
L:  You know I heard they get, like, a million or something.
R:  [NOISE]  That's crazy though.  That's like [MN] -- I mean, what about early teaching, you know.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, --
R:  [NOISE]  I mean I guess you can do whatever you want but those are --
L:  -- teaching that America solves everything.
R:  -- those are only going so far I'm like [NOISE] -- like those boat ones, that they put people on the boat --
L:  Oh, yeah, the Strip Mates or whatever.
R:  that were, like, [NOISE] engaged or something.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no, no, no, that's not --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  I'm, like, "What are they doing?"
L:  -- cool and
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they have to go through, like, two days of dating or something?  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  No, that's not cool at all.  I can't -- [SIGH] I can't be with somebody more than three minutes if I don't vibe them.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  In fact here in New York --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  they do these three minute dating [SIGH] --
R:  Mm.  [NOISE]
L:  -- parties.  [NOISE]
R:  I've heard of those.  [NOISE]
L:  You have to -- there, you know, drinking, or whatever --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and then they ring the bell --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and then you have to, like, talk to someone.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Then you -- you know, catches your eye --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then you've got three minutes to talk to them and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- then you've got to talk --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody else.
R:  Mm, [NOISE] when --
L:  [SIGH]  So, by the end of the night you've talked to, like, twenty people.  [NOISE]  And you --
R:  [MN]  But you've gone to one?  [MN]
L:  Um, yeah, well I used to, ah, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do an event planning for one.  [SIGH]  And it was re- --
R:  Oh, was it fun?  [NOISE]
L:  -- i- i- it -- it was fun --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to see people, like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, you know, change and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, change again and some people looked like they were having a bad time, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then some people looked like they were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- having a good time.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I think --
L:  [SIGH]  But they would have a good time with --
R:  -- I'd like to try something like that.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, they would have a good time with one person --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then the next person will be, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- drag.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  Well --
R:  Well, at least you didn't have to spend all night with 'em, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's three minutes --
R:  And these people that you like you can always give 'em a call.  [NOISE]
L:  And don't you think you can kind of tell whether you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like somebody or not in three minutes?
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]  Pretty much.  [NOISE]  I mean if you --
L:  [SIGH]  What part of, ah ... Cali do you live in?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Pardon me?
L:  What part of Cali do you live in?
R:  [NOISE]  Santana.  It's like, um, Altima[?] way.  I'm actually from Oakland but I just moved down here.  [NOISE]  I'm going to start school down here in August.
L:  Oh, you're starting college or you're finishing?
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  Starting.
L:  O- oh, okay.
R:  I'm twenty four and I [NOISE] -- I just never went so ...  [NOISE]
L:  You don't want to rush into the working.  [SIGH]  I- it -- it sucks right now.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, that's what I'm doing too.  I'm working at home.
L:  Y- you're working as well?
R:  [NOISE]  I work for a long distance company.  [NOISE]  So, that's the [inaudible].  My school's really close.  So, [NOISE] it's not like a whole bunch of commuting 'cause when I was in [NOISE] Oakland I was, like, working in Richmond.  [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  [SIGH]  Th- --
R:  [NOISE]  So, that could have been a ... TV reality show in itself.  [NOISE]  [COUGH]
L:  Working in Richmond?
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no, working in Oakland, living in Richmond.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, commuting every day.  [NOISE]  Like I worked so early that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I had to catch the bus [NOISE] or I had to ride my bike to the bus station [NOISE] 'cause the bus didn't run that early on [inaudible].  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  And then I had to take ... the bus all the way from Richmond to Oakland and then [NOISE] ride my bike to work then.  [NOISE]  It was like g- gosh.  I did that for, like, two months.
L:  [MN]  Damn.  T- that's a lot.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I only take a thirty minute ride on the subway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to my job and that's it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  What do you do?  Oh, you're a- an events planner?  [NOISE]
L:  Ah, fashion merchandising.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, I'm not -- ah, ... that's bad.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, so I work down ... in mid town [SIGH] where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the fashion district is.
R:  [NOISE]  Mm.
L:  [SIGH]  It's pretty okay but it sucks right now 'cause it's been --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- raining and New York i- is, you know, like, gloomy when it's raining.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  So, ... [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  I want to go there so bad, you know -- you can understand.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  You'll have a lot of fun here.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  There's a lot of different things and some are --
R:  [NOISE]  My mother's like, "You don't want to go to New York" [NOISE] but I'm going to get my nursing, um, [NOISE] -- my nursing --
L:  Degree?
R:  -- yeah, so I think -- ah, what I want.
L:  [SIGH]  They have great courses out here for that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, if anything, if you really want to be [SIGH] a real nurse --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- come work in a --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- hospital down here.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  It'll give you all the experience [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can probably be a head nurse back home --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- as soon as you get back --
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause it's crazy over here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the way -- you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the hospitals are run and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's, ah -- I don't even go to the emergency room --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just wait until the next day to go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to a clinic or something.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  They're horrendous.
R:  I know.  That's where I want to go like [NOISE] a thousand dollar bill.  I'm like, you're kidding me even if I don't do anything else.  Just for a week --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [NOISE] please, you know.  I'm saying, like --
L:  [SIGH]  But I -- it's true that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you're a resident for a year --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in ... California y- y- your college is paid for?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  U- um, that's true.  They do have some kind of program [SIGH] where any money that you ge- get a loan for or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that you, um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] you know, get a [NOISE] -- anything for [NOISE] they pay it back.  [NOISE]  They pay back all your loans or any money [NOISE] that you have.  So, ...
L:  When you graduate?
R:  [NOISE]  No, I think that's when you practise for so long.  [NOISE]  It's like teaching.  They do the same thing for teaching [NOISE] 'cause they're so low on nurses [NOISE] and teachers.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, [LIPSMACK] and it has to be on certain majors?
R:  [NOISE]  Pardon me?  [NOISE]
L:  Only on certain majors?
R:  Yeah, it is only for certain ones.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, they don't say that.
R:  [NOISE]  And I -- I didn't even know that I just found that out.  I'm like, "What?  Come on -- you --"
L:  Yeah, my niece told me that and I -- and I've been going to school here and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I was thinking of moving to LA but then I'm like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know what I -- I need ... more money than I make over here.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [MN]  And I'm just not, oh, I -- I don't know I don't --
R:  [NOISE]  It -- it's [inaudible] out there, huh?
L:  -- think the economy's good.  [SIGH]  And I'm trying to move all hell over there.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  I wouldn't move now.
L:  You wouldn't, right?
R:  I'd wait till things get better.  [NOISE]  I wouldn't move right now.
L:  I've been to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've been to San Jose and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to San Francisco.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And I like San Francisco.
R:  [COUGH]  [NOISE]  Yeah, I used to live like in Los Angeles but I don't want to live there because it's really, really crowded.
L:  It is.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Yes, --
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, so's New York.  [SIGH]
R:  -- extremely.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  But like Oakland [inaudible] -- I'm like [NOISE] some where round there, man.
L:  Oh, I wanted to do some student abroad thing and, like, live in London for two years.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, really?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Go to school in London?  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  You've got to speak ... another language?  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  No, they speak English.  They -- they're British.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  So, I mean they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going to have that accent but, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, at least you can understand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- them.  It's not like going to [NOISE] Greece or something.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  So, I was [NOISE] thinking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- of doing that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I -- I figure --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I'm going to be ... middle --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- class, like, just barely making it or --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- living check to check [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'd like to live check to check in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the whole of the country.
R:  [NOISE]  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  Because at least I get, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I get to experience different things and not just be [NOISE] broke.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I could be broke and experience things.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  It's like -- everybody's, like, "Why don't you go into the military?" --
L:  What?
R:  [NOISE]  I'm, "Why don't you go into the military?"
L:  Yeah, exactly.  No, no, that's signing --
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  -- your life away.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  No, I'm not.
L:  You know, the problems this country is getting us into.  [SIGH]  And the only ones that know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are the head honchos that never --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- get sent away anyways.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  So, they don't care what kind of -- what kind of problems -- especially here --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being in New York you feel it more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause they're s- so many [SIGH] Jewish [SIGH] and -- and -- and Muslim people.  You know what I mean?
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, man, they're so touchy over here right now.
R:  [NOISE]  Really?
L:  Yeah, it's just --
R:  But do -- do you like-- did you see the building and stuff?  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I worked right across the street from it.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, my goodness.
L:  And it was just wiped out.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean when you just see something that huge ... there.
R:  G- gone.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  Right.  I think that was like when I was in California and there was a earthquake [NOISE] [SIGH] ... and the bridge fell.  [SIGH]  I mean it was bad enough there was a earthquake but it just made it so much worse [NOISE] that the bridge had fallen --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- down.  [NOISE]  [COUGH]  You know, 'cause you just don't expect, like, something like that to ever, ever happen.
L:  [SIGH]  But it's just --
R:  [NOISE]  I mean even though it's not impossible you just don't [LAUGH] think about it, you know.  [NOISE]
L:  You -- you and th- then the city never stopped being the city because people were volunteering --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to help up -- the -- the d- debris [SIGH] and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they were actually stealing stuff.
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, really?
L:  'Cause you know the World Trade had luxury stores and, [NOISE] you know.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, the merchandise in it.
R:  [NOISE]  What!
L:  Oh, there was one guy caught on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the subway with an arm --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that had a R- Rolex.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, my goodness, you've got to be kidding!
L:  He had the arm wrapped around [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- some piece of cloth and he thought that wasn't going to smell and the cops arrested him.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was crazy.  It was like --
R:  Why didn't he just take the watch off?  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, ha- -- he probably was so nervous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or I don't know but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's a sick individual that was carrying somebody's [SIGH] dead hand around.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, amazing.
R:  Maybe he just wanted to play with the arm.  So, --
L:  Uh-hum.  And now --
R:  -- he was using the watch for an excuse.  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  And now they're giving --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- tickets for everything.  That's how they're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] our new mayor decides to make money for the city.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You get a ticket if you sit on the stairs --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in the subway.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You get a ticket if you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] throw out a wrapper of your cigarette [SIGH] and you missed t- the trash can.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You get a ticket --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] if you sit on a milk crate outside.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  What?
L:  Yep.  Uh-hum, it's just like they're trying to lock us down here.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  That's crazy.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I've wanted to go to there for New Years for so many year.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, New Years is so -- you would find -- don't come with a date --
R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you'll find so many beautiful ... guys and just have a great time.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  Just have a great -- I mean t- the party doesn't stop.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It really doesn't.  [SIGH]  You can go to a six o'clock in the morning --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- party.  You can go to a seven o'clock in the morning party.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Eight o'clock, nine o'clock, what you want.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  And just keep it rolling.  And for that day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all the clubs.  I mean, that's the only thing the clubs jack up their price --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, a hundred dollars to get in.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  That's the only thing.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But if you go to one --
R:  [NOISE]  I'm like -- I'm trying to stand outside and watch the ball drop.
L:  [MN]  Oh, one of those things, huh?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I never -- I mean, yeah, I like to go to a show --
L:  Oh, it gets -- it still gets packed --
R:  -- but I don't want to stay out all night.  [NOISE]
L:  -- by, yeah, I shouldn't fool you, it still gets packed at ball drop.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's pretty --
