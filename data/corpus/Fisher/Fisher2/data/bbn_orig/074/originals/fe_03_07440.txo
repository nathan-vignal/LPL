L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Janet[?].
L:  I'm sorry, Dana[?]?
R:  Janet.
L:  Oh, Janet.  Hi, I'm Carol[?].
R:  Hi.  So, reality TV huh? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, I don't kn- -- I actually -- I don't watch a lot of TV so I -- I've only caught a few episodes here and there.  I haven't watched any of them on a regular basis.
R:  N- -- I've really -- haven't really watched much of it myself, but I -- I real- -- I can't believe the popularity of the reality TV. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they -- people love em. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Ah, wha- -- what bothers me is the, um -- wh- what's the one where they eat the worms and all that stuff?  Ah --
L:  I'm -- I'm sorry, I can barely hear you.
R:  Ah, the -- the TV show where they eat the worms and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- eat all the strange stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen that.  Is that Fear Factor?
R:  Fear Factor, yeah.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  A- and they keep -- they say they keep getting worse and worse because people enjoy that.  It's like, "How do they enjoy that?". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, I have to say -- I -- see I really don't watch much TV but I've come across that a couple of times and as disgusted as I am by it, it's almost like [NOISE] the car wreck effect.
R:  Y- --
L:  Like I find myself watching it and thinking, "I can't believe people are willing to do this for money" --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- so, I -- I don't know if people enjoy it or if it's just so astonishing that you kind of, you know, have to watch.
R:  Maybe that's it, because I'm -- I'm like you, when I do see it I just stop and think, "Oh, I can't believe this" but yet I don't turn the channel. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah and I'll end up saying, you know, "I can't believe I just wasted twenty minutes watching, you know, people eating worms".
R:  Right. [LAUGH] 
L:  You know? [LAUGH] But -- I mean, you know, I -- I could use fifty thousand dollars but there's no way I would even consider doing ninety percent of the stunts.
R:  Th- there is a limit. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you're dignity, I think, is worth a little bit more than fifty grand.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  I couldn't believe it.
L:  Or not even fifty grand, a shot at fifty grand.
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  Um -- yeah, I [inaudible] -- so, I kind of -- I -- I think that's why that show gets rating, I mean -- again, I haven't met anybody who has watched it and said, "Oh, yeah.  I really enjoy that show".
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Everybody [NOISE] has the same reaction, just like --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- "I can't believe I'm seeing what I'm seeing".
R:  R- right.  Right.
L:  But -- yeah, I don't know if that's the same -- you know, the same reason that the other reality shows are so popular, because they're not ...
R:  Well, the -- the ones -- the -- the Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire? you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- those type shows, oh [SIGH] -- um, once again, I can't believe that the women put themselves in that type of situation.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I think -- you know, our culture has gotten to the point where you know you're somebody when you're famous --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, regardless of how you got famous.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  You know?  I mean, if you look at that New York Times reporter who -- he's clearly the worst reporter on Earth since he's making stuff up, he has a book deal --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- whereas, you know, all the schmucks who actually work hard and try and do a good job -- how many other New York Times' columnists or reporters can you name?
R:  That's -- that's --
L:  No- --
R:  -- very true.
L:  Not many. [NOISE] You know, I'm --
R:  It's usually the scandals that make the news and make the person famous --
L:  Yeah.  It's like --
R:  -- and then --
L:  -- "Oh, I was on TV [NOISE] I succeeded".
R:  Exactly.
L:  "Well, you were on TV because you killed somebody --"
R:  Well -- I mean --
L:  -- "So, [several inaudible words]" --
R:  -- look at these people that are in prison that have a book deal [LAUGH] or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a movie deal, you know, going on?  That when they get out they have all this money.
L:  Oh, it happens all the time.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I guess maybe that's what it is, but it -- it's just -- or [MN] part of me wants to believe it's more that than it is actually thinking that you are so desperate for -- to be rich [LAUGH] that you would do something like that.
L:  Yeah, well some of them don't even, you know, get the money.  I mean, normally there's only one big winner.
R:  That's true.
L:  But yeah, I -- I -- you know, if you -- if you listen to people talk about why they decide to be on those shows, a lot of times it's just, "You know, well I -- you know, I -- I -- I want the experience" and well --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, it's --
L:  -- you -- you want people to see you on TV.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You want your coworkers to go, "Oh, wow.  I saw Marcy[?] on TV --"
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  "-- last night".  That's what you're looking for.
R:  It has to be, but -- ah, it seems like every time you turn on the TV there's a new reality show --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it makes me wonder, wh- where's the limit?  When are people going to get tired of watching this kind of stuff.
L:  It's -- it's probably like any other cycle, eventually they'll -- they'll bottom out, they'll -- you know, TV shows -- they're always just recycling the same old ideas --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and eventually they'll just start recycling stuff that they've already recycled --
R:  Well, it's sort of --
L:  -- and people get sick of it.
R:  -- seems like it's getting to that point now, you know, that it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like they're -- they can't come up with any fresh ideas and if they are, they're so far fetched that they -- who even wants to bother watching it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So [MN] -- so, maybe it's to that point --
L:  You know, I --
R:  -- or getting close to that point.
L:  -- I hope so.  I heard about one where they're filming [NOISE] -- ah, it's -- it's [NOISE] going to be a series -- like a reality series in a frat house.
R:  Oh.
L:  Well, what is real about life in a frat house? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I [LAUGH] ...
L:  I don't see where a lot of people are gonna identify with that and --
R:  I don't think so.
L:  -- from my experience with frat guys, I don't think they're gonna -- it's like -- you know, really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- be [NOISE] charmed by their behaviour.  It's going to be a bunch of guys sitting around scratching themselves --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  Right.
L:  That can only be so entertaining for so long.
R:  Exactly.  Who wants to watch that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean -- maybe some really young kids but I -- I would think anybody [LAUGH] else --
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  -- would -- would be pretty bored with that.
L:  I do think with like Survivor say and I -- I've seen a few episodes of that and I sort of got involved in that -- I mean, a little bit, I wasn't like one of these crazed fans --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I could see the appeal because you do sort of identify with those people a little bit and it's sort of -- I found it to be the ultimate escapism.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah, I come home from a hard day at work, yeah I sit down I read for a little bit [NOISE] or whatever [NOISE] whereas these people they're just s- stuck in this jungle --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or wherever they are and everybody's out to get them and you know they're out to get you --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it's sort of like, "Okay, their problems are a lot worse than mine, right now".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So -- you know, I can just forget about mine, you know?  I do- don't have to worry about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the bills or how much I hate my job --
R:  Oh, see I had a really --
L:  -- or whatever the issue may be.
R:  -- hard time following that, because I -- I -- I think the whole time I would watch it, I would think, "Why would they even agree to go to this place and go through this and live this way?".  I -- I just couldn't -- I guess I -- I just couldn't relate to them at all.
L:  See, that -- I -- I don't know if I would do Survivor, but I could see the motivation there, at least a little bit more.  It's not as -- I mean, you're not eating slugs, there's more money at stake.  I mean, I think there is an element of a challenge, like are --
R:  Oh, but --
L:  -- you tough enough to tough it out?
R:  -- but I have seen them eat bugs and stuff, you know? [LAUGH] It's like -- and -- and then when -- the- they look like anorexic when they come back.  It's like they've starved themselves --
L:  Well, that's true.  Yeah.
R:  -- to death.  They have worked themselves to death and -- and, you know, for the most part, most of them don't get anything out of it. [NOISE]
L:  I don't know if the first few people knew that it was go- -- it was going to be that tough though.
R:  Probably not.  Probably the first ones didn't realise it and -- because originally, I don't think I realised what the show was going to be.  It was like, "Oh, they'll let them have this or do that or ..." you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it was a lot tougher than I thought it would be.  But I -- I think that was -- I -- th- the appeal for me was over after the first episode -- you know, the first, ah --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thing that they did.  It was like -- after that everyone knew and I thought, "Why would you do that?". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But maybe that's just me.  It's just not my thing. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not saying it's something I would look forward to, but I mean, I -- I could at least see where that would appeal to some people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- moreso than, you know -- ah, like I said, the Fear Factor show, I don- -- I don't know where they find those people, other -- unless they're just people who are so desperate to be on TV and this is their best shot.
R:  Well, it's like most of them say, "I want to show everyone that I can do this and I'm --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- gonna".  It's like they're -- they're -- they're out here with a chip on their shoulder.  They have to prove something to someone --"
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, that -- ah -- a- and most of them are pretty young and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's like -- oh, it's just one of those deals where i- if you're really young there's a lot of things you can do -- you'll do when you're really young --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- which you won't do [LAUGH] later in life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so.
L:  And I don't know if this is true of Fear Factor, but I know on [NOISE] the other shows, if you -- you pay attention, a lot of them are part time actors or part time models.  I think -- y- you know, for them it's just, "Hey, this is a way to get my face out there.  Maybe --"
R:  Maybe.
L:  "-- some casting agent will see me".
R:  I hadn't really thought of that, but maybe that's true.  But I -- I guess if I -- I was doing that, I would think the same thing.  It's like, "Any way --"
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  "-- I can get on TV".
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's -- it's a quick way to -- even if you don't win the money, well, you know what, "Maybe somebody sees me and decides to cast me in, you know, a commercial and that commercial will lead to a TV show --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- and so on and so forth".
R:  Right.
L:  Because -- you know -- I mean, from -- from that perspective it's just sort of a tactical business decision --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but you know, I still --
R:  Well, that's -- um --
L:  -- wouldn't eat worms. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I just ran across that Thirty Seconds Of Fame last night.  Have you see that?
L:  No, I haven't even heard of that one.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] -- ah, it's -- it's like, ah, the old Gong Show or something, these people come out and they have thirty seconds to do whatever talent they have and -- and the audience can vote to -- to boo them off the stage or whatever and then at the very end someone wins fifty thousand dollars --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- decided is the best one.
L:  So, like the Gong Show but with the elimination element?
R:  Right.
L:  That's strange.
R:  Yeah, that's different sh- -- kind of show. [LAUGH]
L:  Was it interesting?
R:  Well, I wasn't that interested in it, just simply because it moved too quickly.  Thirty seconds and someone else was up, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the one's that seemed like they were really good, you didn't see enough of them to be able to tell --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so.
L:  Yeah, I -- I kind of felt like that about -- I did
