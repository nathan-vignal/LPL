R:  I'm in New York too.  [LAUGH]
L:  You are?  [LAUGH]
R:  Staten Island.
L:  Where?  In Staten Island?
R:  Staten Island, New York.
L:  Oh, I'm in, um, Queens and, um, this is like my second phone call.
R:  Yeah.  This is my second one too.
L:  Yeah.  Well, um ...
R:  I just left Queens.  I used to live in Queens, Queens Village.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Jamaica.
R:  Hampstead.
L:  So, you -- I -- I really don't know too much about reality T.V., uh, I know what it is but, um ...
R:  Okay.  Do you know what?  Reality T.V. I guess they mean just the ones that are true based, like life true -- true stories like.
L:  Yeah.  Like, they said Survivor and, um, Top Models, the -- the new mod- -- the Next Model and stuff like that --
R:  Oh, yeah, 'cause ...
L:  -- that they're showing now.
R:  Those -- stuff like that, reality based T.V., like stuff like -- yeah, uh ...
L:  Well, do you watch a lotta reality T.V.?
R:  I watch Law and Order.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like Law and Order and I like Who Wants to be a Millionaire.
L:  Well, you know, they -- would -- I guess what they wanna know is, um, why it's so popular now.
R:  The questions on Who Wants to be a Million- -- Who Wants to be a Millionaire are very easy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're easy -- easier than Jeopardy.
L:  Well, you know, it seems like nowadays, um, every night they have some kind of reality show.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  And, um, I -- I guess, um, why they're so popular now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like -- why do you think?
R:  Uh, because a lotta people like stuff like that.  I don't know.  They just like stuff like that now.  They have to always create new things, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Producers always have to come out with something new, you know, to keep people tuned in I guess.
L:  Well, I'm thinking like twenty years ago -- I'm not that old -- but like twenty years ago there -- even thirty years ago --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there was nothing like that.  Everything was just make believe.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  All these make -- you know, regular T.V. and the Cosby's and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just stuff to make you laugh and -- or, you know, like dramas like Law and Order --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you say you watch that, but now with the reality shows it -- I don't know if people -- they're trying to say they wanna little dose of reality.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I don't like it though.  [LAUGH]
R:  You don't?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  I like the -- you know, the stuff from back in the days of early shows.
R:  Yeah, the fiction.
L:  Yeah, the fiction, I like those --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, because -- you know, when you come home from work or school or whatever you just wanna -- you know, if you do watch T.V. you just wanna go and do something else.
R:  Right.  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You know?  And the reality shows like it's, you know, something that's hap- happening for real, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm a T.V. person.
L:  Are you?
R:  But I like certain things.  I like certain things like reality shows and I like ...
L:  Which ones do you like?
R:  I like the, uh, Real T.V. --
L:  The Real T.V. that's ...
R:  -- Ripley's Believe it or Not, um --
L:  Okay.  Yeah.
R:  -- Court T.- ...
L:  That's fun though, Ripley's Believe it or Not.  They always -- that -- they -- they had that from back in the days, right?
R:  Yeah.  Court T.V., um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- let's see -- Cops --
L:  Cops.
R:  -- um, and, you know, crime scene things like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the crime scene investigation on Channel Two I like that.
L:  I seen one last night with Patricia Cornwell.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Did you see that one?
R:  Yeah.
L:  With the Louisiana ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You did, okay.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Uh, you know what, I didn't think they were talking about those -- those episodes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know what?  They're -- they're talking about like Survivor --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, you -- when you go ...
R:  Survival, yeah, I used to watch.  I watched the first one with Tyson Beckfoot.
L:  I never seen any one of those.  No.
R:  Remember when they had the first one?  They had, um, Joan Rivers doing it?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She was ...
R:  [LIPSMACK] Tyson Beckfoot.
L:  Okay.  Now I remember in the jungle.
R:  Jul- -- downtown Julie Brown.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I think I seen one episode of that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that was it.  [LAUGH]  That ...
R:  Yeah, I watched that for about maybe a week.
L:  You -- did you like it?
R:  Yeah, I did.
L:  You did?
R:  Yeah.  Those reality based T.V. shows I do like.  Yeah.
L:  I think that's why they got so much now because the first one or two that came out people liked it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was like it was a hit, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was different, you know [NOISE], than what everybody else --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- had been watching and I guess 'cause it was such a hit now everybody's trying to --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- make a reality show on different shows.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I think it's going to phase out.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think it's gonna phase out after a while.
R:  Uh-huh.  You think so?
L:  I think so.
R:  Yeah.  I don't ...
L:  'Cause it's too much.  It's -- it's like they just coming at you crazy now, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Every -- they have, uh, reality show on every subject.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know what I mean?  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think people like make believe.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  It's -- it's kinda like, you know, I think people -- you know, you can't get away from that.  The fascination[?] has always been -- it's always been there, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I think it's easier to create.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Reality you just put a camera and you just -- just watch people what they do.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  It's no real -- like you said, it's not creativity, you know?
R:  Like, um, well, I guess you could consider the Blind Date and all that, that's reality too.
L:  Blind Date I don't even think I've seen it.
R:  That's reality.
L:  But I could -- by the title I -- I know what it's about.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's a dating thing.  But it's reality too.  That's reality.
L:  Blind Date is that the one that comes on at night?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I think that one's kinda fun.
R:  And the Fifth Wheel and all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ain't that reality?  That's considered ...
L:  I used to like that one.  That was kinda fun 'cause people used to diss[?] each other sometimes or sometimes they would get together.
R:  Yeah, 'cause that's based on the same thing, reality.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  That's -- I don't -- I can't imagine someone putting a camera --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- inside like your living room or something and you're just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, you act like they're not there.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I don't know how they do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  The actors and then they just act like they weren't there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like they just ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's amazing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know what?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess you have to have the same kinda personality --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, to like that kind of stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you're -- you're the receiver of this phone call?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, you just tell 'em what time for the person to call and you're in the house or you just pick up the phone and ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Do you know if they're doing any other studies?
R:  They said they'll keep us informed.
L:  That's what they say.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um, they didn't inform me of study.  I seen it on the newspaper.
R:  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I got it from a friend in the hospital.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I was visiting someone in the hospital and they had given me a flyer and it had this information on it and I had called.  This is my second conversation now I'm having.  This is my third conversation --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I'm sorry.  Third.
L:  Oh, so this is your last one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You can't do no more after that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  So, after -- you know, when you watched programs like that, I mean, the reality based T.V. programs, I mean, like are you supposed to, um [LIPSMACK] -- I mean, will they ask you about any -- any more later on or something?
L:  You're -- you're talking like the, um -- this study?
R:  Yes.  This -- as far as this -- this one.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know how that works out.  I think what they're trying to, um -- I don't know.  This is a linguistics study --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm thinking they l- -- they're trying to, um, pick up the voice patterns.  I'm not sure.  I really don't know what it -- 'cause that's what it said the linguistic data.
R:  Yeah.  Like -- yeah, yeah.
L:  They're mak- ...
R:  What they're gonna get out of it.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  What ...
L:  But, um, the last topic I did was tips.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the only reason I didn't call -- this is the second time I -- I didn't call anybody for weeks because I -- you know, I get nervous to call.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm a bit -- like, I just gotta start talking and --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, I think like you sound like a fool sometimes.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um ...
R:  And I spoke to someone first from Tampa, Florida, a guy --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and then I spoke to someone from Seattle, Washington, a woman.
L:  Okay.
R:  That the second and now the third, New York, New York, me and you from New York --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Well, you said earlier, you know, that's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just got on the ferry and that's it, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just left Queens four months ago.  I was -- yeah, I used to go through ...
L:  I love -- I like Queens.
R:  Yeah.  I used to go through Jamaica to get to where I had to live.
L:  Okay.
R:  I used to go through [inaudible] sometimes, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just got out here from, um, Brooklyn --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- and, you know ...?
R:  And that needs to be a reality based T.V.
L:  Definitely, Brooklyn.  [LAUGH]
R:  Now, Queens too, right there, Jamaica.  [LAUGH]
L:  Queens, I -- yeah, Queens too 'cause Queens is very cultural.
R:  Because it's so busy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very ...
L:  There's so much culture then they coexist.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  That's true.
L:  Um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but the -- the reality T.V. -- I -- I don't watch T.V. much --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, the few times I've caught it it's like I'm not going run home to catch it, you know?
R:  Right.  Right.  Right.
L:  You know?  Really like I said, after a day's working, the day's things, it's ni- nice to go into some kind of fiction --
R:  Uh-huh.  And --
L:  -- than ...
R:  -- what -- would Jerry Springer be reality?
L:  Oh, yeah.  Jerry Springer's cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  Would that be based reality?
L:  I don't know.  I don't think so because the reality shows are more like you just basically watching people do what they normally do.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You know, like you said, Blind Date, you watch somebody --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- going on -- they're really on a blind date for real.
R:  Yeah.  I like ...
L:  That's just -- I guess that talk shows that's a different category.
R:  Oh, okay, 'cause I watch Blind Date a lot.
L:  Well, I like Jerry Springer because he [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, boy, he takes you somewhere else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um ...
R:  I watch Blind Date a lot.
L:  Yeah, the Blind -- yeah, those reality shows --
R:  Uh-huh, and Real T.V.
L:  -- I -- I don't really know.
R:  Real T.V. I like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, all the stunts they have and crazy people doing crazy things and bungy jumping and this and that, you know?
L:  I -- I think people, like I said, after a while they're gonna run out of -- run out of ideas.
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  You know?  And it's gonna be like okay, what else?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You -- you can't really show the people anything else, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  That type of thing with the, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the dramas and all that you can always make something up.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, we have ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  You did all the talking.
L:  Did I?  I'm sorry.  Let me quiet now.
R:  No, no.  Keep talking.  I'll listen to you.
L:  I get nervous and I --
R:  No.  Keep talking.
L:  -- I keep talking.
R:  You know?  We're supposed to have a conversation, but the reality T.V. getting back to that I don't even know, um ...  Yeah.  I can't find the remote.
L:  I read ...  I'm sorry.
R:  Uh-huh.  Go ahead.
L:  I read in an article that, um -- and they were talking about the reality T.V. and they said they didn't want it -- I -- I forgot which was the first one.  Uh, it could've been Survivor or Millionaire or -- one of those names and, like I said, when they did it the ratings were so high that they said give the people what they want, they like that so we're gonna start everybody doing all these reality shows --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and they're predicting that it's gonna --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that it's gonna --
