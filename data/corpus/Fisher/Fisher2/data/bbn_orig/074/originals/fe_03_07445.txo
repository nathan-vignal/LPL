L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Uh, my name is Muzo[?].  I'm calling from, uh, Seattle, Washington.
L:  Oh, I'm Patty from north -- or Fort Worth, Texas.  [LAUGH]
R:  From Texas, wow!  That's ...
L:  Damn it, ya got ya a Texas girl!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, wow!  [several inaudible words], um, and, uh, this is my first call.  And for you?
L:  Oh, uh, this is only my second one.
R:  The second one.  Good.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, good.  Uh, so, what do you think about the topic?  I -- I think -- I -- I don't watch a lot of, uh, reality T.V. but, um, uh, it's an interesting topic because it's, uh, quite popular, isn't it?
L:  It really is and I don't know.  Like Joe Millionaire is kinda fun to watch.
R:  Yeah.  What -- what, uh -- did you watch, uh, To Find a Millionaire or ...?  I didn't -- I don't -- I don't even know the correct name of the program.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- yeah, some of them are okay.  But, like I said, they are popular.
R:  Yeah, they are.  They are.  But I don't watch a lot of T.V. here and, uh, my -- my English is not as you, uh -- experience.
L:  It's okay.
R:  It's not too good.  So ...
L:  Where are you from?
R:  I'm from, uh, Germany, uh, I'm half German and half Turkish.
L:  Oh, cool!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, how cool!  Well, welcome.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  How long ya been in Washington?
R:  Uh, only like, uh, one and a half years like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, and, um, not -- not yet -- not yet so long.
L:  Yeah.  You're getting pretty good with the language.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well -- well, what -- what do you ...?
R:  But -- but it's a good way to improve it this -- this, uh, telephone study.
L:  Oh, no, that's a good idea.
R:  So ...
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Yeah, uh ...
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Uh, I also try to watch T.V. but, um -- I -- I watch -- watch more movies or, uh -- only when I have, uh, time to do so and, um, I don't know.  There are reality, uh, shows in -- back in Germany too and in Turkey too and you, uh -- over there.  So, I think the -- the, uh, the grandfather of all this -- this Big Brother is Watching You and -- and, uh, they made the same, uh, shows in Europe too like this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh ...
L:  Huh.  Well, I don't -- I -- you know, I'm with you, I don't watch a lot of them myself.  I try to watch movies more than anything, but I don't know some of 'em I figure are just kinda silly.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You -- you don't know nothing about like, uh, American Idol?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Did you -- you don't know what that show is?
R:  I don't know, no.  Uh ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, not -- not that ...
L:  Well, then what do you think about the Audi car?  Didn't they say that?
R:  Uh, no.  Um, did they -- the -- the show, uh, to, uh, Mar- Marry a Millionaire that is, uh -- I think that shows a lot about the people, the -- they all watch it, they -- people want maybe to find a millionaire, the- -- themselves and ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I don't know about all that.  I think that show's a bunch of m- [LAUGH] -- money hungry women.
R:  Yeah, money hungry women -- women.
L:  I mean, that's all that is.  They -- they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they weren't in it for love.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's why, you know, it's kinda funny.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But that's the way -- that's the way things are though.
R:  Yeah.  But, uh -- so -- and the men would, uh, say, uh, they -- they all they want to be millionaires because they wanted the m- -- the women to run after themselves and, uh, so the competition is hot.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, oh, shoot, I wouldn't have [inaudible] a millionaire I guess.  I don't -- I don't know.  I wouldn't.  [LAUGH]
R:  You wouldn't?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I ain't gonna chase no damn man.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, you know, um [LAUGH], it's kinda funny, but not when ya got the whole world chasing the same one.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, goodness.
R:  And -- and to -- everybody watched -- watched the candidates while they are after the millionaire, but -- and that -- I think too that, uh, I mean, if you are a candidate all your friends and family will know that you are only after the money -- money and to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everything for, uh, the money and the guy and, uh, that's the same -- that's pretty much the same with the dating shows, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That, uh ...
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  The girls go on a dating ...  So, do you watch some of them?
L:  Some of 'em.
R:  Yeah.  Did you ever think about participating in one of those shows?
L:  A- about what?
R:  Uh, did you ever think about participating in one of those shows?
L:  No, I never have.  Uh-uh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I don't -- no, no, I always thought it was [MN] -- I mean, I don't wanna be on public T.V. where everybody could see me --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- having a [LAUGH] -- a relationship.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's kinda [inaudible] in confidence.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Because to me it's not real --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- on T.V.  It's -- it's fake.  It wouldn't be real.
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  I -- I mean ...
R:  -- that's the point.  You are very right.  Um, um [PAUSE] -- yeah, uh, the reality show isn't real -- for -- for real.  It is -- it is fake.  Yeah.
L:  It's -- it's artificial.  Absolutely.  You're right.
R:  Yeah, it's artificial.  It's, uh ...
L:  It's artificial.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It is.  It --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it sure is.  So, that's why, no, I never thought about participating 'cause [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  -- I -- I like the real thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.  Me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  That's the way God meant it to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
R:  Absolutely.  So -- but -- and that's the reason you don't watch them too so much?
L:  Well [LIPSMACK], no, I don't 'cause I'm -- I like to stay busy, you know, it's warm weather and I -- so I like to work outside.  I've got a swimming pool in the back yard and --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- I -- I -- well, I decided to get into it and so I don't watch a whole lot of it when it's nice and pretty.  So, I'm -- I'm working out in my back yard and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I don't -- I don't have any one show that I have to watch, you know?  A lotta people have like seven o'clock such and such comes on.  I don't.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- well, I used to, but I don't have H.B.O. no more.  [LAUGH]  There were two shows I used to watch --
R:  [MN]

L:  -- talk your ear off --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I talk fast.  I'm sorry.
R:  No, that's --
L:  I'll try to slow down. 
R:  -- that's -- that's very good.  That's very nice, um ...
L:  I'm just a kinda bubbly kinda girl.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, uh ...
R:  That's good.

L:  So, I -- I haven't been answering all, you know, the calls.  I don't answer 'cause I like -- it takes up a lotta minutes.
R:  Yeah.  Actually ...

R:  Yes.  Uh, uh, and I -- I don't know how this, uh, goes but, uh ...
L:  I don't get ...  [LAUGH]
R:  I read it on a paper and, um, I -- I -- I decided to participate and --
