R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, my stars!  I'm from -- I live in Bedford.
L:  Oh, my goodness!  I actually live in Firemount.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow!  I --

R:  -- they would p- put me with somebody local.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  How funny.  So, what's your favorite holiday?  [SIGH]
R:  Christmas.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I like -- ah, you know, I was thinking about it.  It's so funny 'cause that's the second time I've heard that question today.  [SIGH]
R:  Really?
L:  Uh-huh.  And I was d- d- doing something or listening to the radio and it came up.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Somebody e- else was asking a- and --
R:  Oh, how funny.
L:  -- and I was like, "Hm, [SIGH] I'm not sure".
R:  Probably 'cause it's Father's Day right now.
L:  [SIGH]  That's true.  That's --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- true.  Christmas is good.  [SIGH]  But, um, [SIGH] I don't know.
R:  I used to like Easter except ... u- until this year.
L:  Oh, yeah?  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Did something happen?
R:  [SIGH]  Just -- y- yeah, kind of bad stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh!
R:  [SIGH]  But it has to do with, um, -- the reason I liked Easter and Christmas is because of Jesus.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  And, you know, Jesus was born at Christmas time and then ... at Easter, you know, he was resurrected.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  And, um, I like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- y- you know -- so I liked 'em both equally but ... at --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- Christmas time I go home, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- which is Michigan.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  So, ... are you from here?
L:  [SIGH]  I -- I am not from here but ... [MN] I don't --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  -- I'm from California.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay!  [SIGH]  Wow!
L:  [COUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  What's your favorite holiday?
L:  [MN]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  I don't know.  It is -- it's probably Christmas, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- or Thanksgiving and -- I don't know.
R:  I like Thanksgiving.
L:  'Cause my family usually comes down here on Thanksgiving and Christmas.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  From California?
L:  Actually nobody lives in California any m- more.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  My -- my mom passed away a few years ago and my dad and step mom live in Illinois now.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  [NOISE]  So, ...
R:  It's nicer here --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- at Thanksgiving time.  [SIGH]
L:  O- oh, well California was nice too actually but --
R:  No, I mean than -- than Illinois.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, that's --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- why they like to come down here.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  They like anything to get out of s- snow.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yes.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  So, I --
R:  Do you --
L:  -- that's probably my favorite now.  [SIGH]
R:  Because you get to be with family?
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  Me too.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Me too.
L:  [SIGH]  And, you know, everybody has some days off and it's r- relaxing, and --
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's like -- it's not as stressful as Christmas.  [SIGH]
R:  It is relaxing.  It is.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  What do you do for a living?
L:  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]  Right now I -- I'm going back to school.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay, to do what?
L:  Um, nurse, actually.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, that's a great profession.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  We need nurses.
L:  I know.  So, --
R:  That's awesome.
L:  -- what about you?
R:  I'm a teacher.
L:  Oh, good!  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Now I've [SIGH] -- after being out of school for almost ... w- what?  Just thirteen years, I decided to go back.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, ...
R:  So, you're about ... the same age as me then.
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [MN] I think it's a l- life ... changing decision.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Do you go to church around here?
L:  [SIGH]  No, I don't really go to church.  [SIGH]  I haven't, [SIGH] ah, it's just because of -- my h- husband works on the weekends and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's just no fun to go by yourself.  [SIGH]
R:  It's n- not.  It's not --
L:  No.  [SIGH]
R:  -- f- fun.  [SIGH]  See I've been single so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I go by myself all the time.  [MN]  But, um, yeah, I go to First Baptist, Euless.
L:  Oh, yeah.  M- my --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sister, um, [SIGH] my sis -- my sister lives up in Allen and she [SIGH] g- goes to a church up in Plano.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  G- g- good.
L:  And, um, for the holidays I go up there with her.  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  S- so, they asked if we could create a holiday what would it [LAUGH] be and what --
L:  Y- yeah, I --
R:  -- would people c- celebrate.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- have no idea.  [SIGH]
R:  I've never thought of that.
L:  Ah --
R:  We have a lot of holidays.
L:  We have [SIGH] s- so m-  many.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Let's see we have one day --
L:  [SIGH]  I don't have any idea.  That's just the goofiest question [LAUGH] I've ever he- [LAUGH] --
R:  May, June, July --
L:  -- 'cause there's already a Mother's Day, Father's Day, Grandparents' Day [SIGH] -- you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- it's like --  [LAUGH]
R:  But we really don't have anything in August.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  What can we do in August?  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  [SIGH]  [PAUSE]
R:  [SIGH]  I mean it has to be -- I think it would have to be something patriotic because we have, [SIGH] like, the Fourth of July.
L:  We got Memorial Day, Veterans' Day, Fourth of July ...
R:  Y- y- yeah, and I think it needs to be p- patriotic.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Well, --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- it's definitely fitting for the times right now.
R:  [NOISE]  I think s- so.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Hm.
R:  [NOISE]  And then we could just, um, [NOISE] -- I don't know, do you like a twenty one gun salute or something?  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  That would be good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Any excuse for a day off of work.  Right?  [LAUGH]
R:  That's what I t- think.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, and -- [SIGH] and even those holidays that are just one day, you know, Fourth of July or Veterans' Day --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- or Memorial Day, Labor Day, [NOISE] [SIGH] I mean those are just so [SIGH] c- cool.
L:  It's just so nice to ... b- be off for, you know, --
R:  Oh, absolutely.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  And just to --
L:  -- [NOISE] for whatever the reason is.  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to realize how lucky we are to be Americans.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Maybe we should just have an American Day.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  H- hey!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A national American Day, --
L:  There you go.
R:  -- [NOISE] would work.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  That's fun.
L:  I never thought about it.  I never thought about that before.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  When I heard that I was like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] "Okay, that's really interesting".
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Then we have something in January, something in --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- February, something in [NOISE] [SIGH] M- March, something in April, something in M- May, [NOISE] ... [SIGH] something in June, July.  [MN]  We don't have anything in August.
L:  I don't think so.  [SIGH]
R:  We have something in September, October, [SIGH] November and December.  We don't have [LAUGH] a- anything in A- August.  [LAUGH]
L:  August is an uncelebrated month.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I wonder we could do, like, --
L:  It is, it's totally --
R:  -- a Back to School.
L:  -- blank.  Isn't that funny?
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  I just pulled out my calendar and it's just absolutely totally blank.
R:  Y- y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  What about Back to School Day?
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That is a s- shopping day.  [LAUGH]
R:  We get, like, Ch -- oh, there you go, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, how they have the n- no tax days?  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  We could have that.  [SIGH]  But we --
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [SIGH]
R:  -- could have it during the week, not just on a weekend, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like on a Wednesday or something.
L:  So, that ... p- people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- can ... t- take the day off with their kids and go shopping.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think s- s- so.
L:  [SIGH]  E- Election Day.  Veterans' Day.  I'm looking at all the holidays.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Veterans' Day.  Christmas Day.
R:  [LAUGH]  There's nothing in August.
L:  There is nothing.  [SIGH]  Martin Luther King.  Is there another famous person that needs to be [NOISE] celebrated?
R:  H- h- h- hm.  [SIGH]  Certainly, there's somebody whose ... f- famous --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- who's born in August.
L:  [SIGH]  Certainly, you'd think.
R:  When's George W's birthday?  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  That one might only be a Texas holiday, though.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  That's okay, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- 'cause we live in Texas.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [COUGH]
R:  How funny.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]

R:  Okay.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, what do you like the best, California, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Texas or North Carolina?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, ah, North Carolina, n- no.  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, --
R:  [SIGH]  That's what I've heard from a lot of people with --
L:  It's --
R:  -- allergy problems.
L:  -- it's -- oh, it's t- terrible allergies and it's just so hot and humid.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.

R:  Okay.
L:  They were like, "Are you married?"  And I said, "No, I'm not".  "O- oh, oh, my God!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And I said, "W- what, are you serious?"  There was this -- I mean they want you married and pregnant by the time you're, ... [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, twenty two.  [SIGH]
R:  W- wow!
L:  It's so different.  It's a whole different --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] [NOISE] it's like a whole different way of living there.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  And, you know, you are -- you're supposed to [SIGH] ... graduate --
R:  [NOISE]

R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they just [SIGH] find --
R:  They don't finish their degree.
L:  -- "Find yourself a man and get married".  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  And I was never ... r- raised that way.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  See, I'm from Michigan where the average, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- age to get married is like twenty eight.  [MN]  So, --

R:  It's pretty high.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's the -- I was -- +actually I was kind of surprised when you think it [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.

L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- aren't there, though, y- y- you know.  [LAUGH]

R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  And it's just, o- o- oh, I've -- I couldn't l- live like that again.  [SIGH]
