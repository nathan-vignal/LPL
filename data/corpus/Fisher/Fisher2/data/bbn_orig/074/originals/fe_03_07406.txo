R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, I'm Kelly[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Michelle[?].
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  I'm calling [NOISE] from Maryland.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Saint Louis.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, what do you think about the topic?
L:  Um, I don't think I heard all of them [LAUGH] that clearly but um, I would say probably smoking.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And see, I'd probably say gossip. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  Why?
R:  Well, I -- I'm Jewish --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and in judaism, gossip is seen as like a really evil thing that can destroy a person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They say that in some ways it's even worse than murder because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it goes on and on and on.  Like if you gossip about one person, it can destroy their reputation with thousands of people in an instant and it's -- I don't know, I -- it's so -- it's such a [MN] painful, hurtful, evil thing that I've seen happen.  I mean, I totally understand smoking physically --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, and, you know, alcohol abuse and all of that, all of that's really unhealthy too, but I don't know, when I heard gossip I thought, "Oh, yeah that's definitely --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a bad, bad habit". [MN] --"
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  But um, I --
L:  Well, I -- I agree with you there.  Um, I -- I mean, I just think that's -- you know, that's -- I mean, they're all basically bad habits --
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  -- I just think -- I just think that [NOISE] smoking would probably be more serious because that's an actual health risk --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and then you're [NOISE] hurting other people too with second hand smoke.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah, what was the other ones they said?  Alcohol abuse too --
R:  Alcohol abuse, um, not exercising --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, what is it, alcohol abuse, smoking, ah, I think they said overeating --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or excessive caffeine consumption.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know, to me the -- the smoking is -- I mean, in terms of like health risks --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's definitely the number one, but then excessive alcohol use is also -- that can be pretty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- serious because then you're hurting your health --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but then you're also destroying your family and your friendships and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, your career possibly, so that one can be pretty serious too.
L:  Yeah.  But I would think smoking would be more serious because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, even though alcohol abuse affects you and your immediate family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, people that interact with you, I mean, smoking can affect complete strangers.
R:  But so could, um --
L:  You're undermining their health too.
R:  -- alcohol abuse, if you drive.
L:  Well, you have a point there.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know, I mean.
L:  Too true.
R:  I mean, I -- I tot- -- I hear what you're saying --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- that makes total sense --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I was just thinking, "Well, if you have a habit of drinking too much and, you know, your judgement is impaired and you get behind the wheel, you could, you know, affect a lot of other people re- -- pretty seriously".
L:  That's true.
R:  So, that's -- that's one thing.  [MN] But um, I don't know, I'm -- I'm trying to think of like what my worst habit is now.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  I think probably not exercising.  That's [LAUGH] -- 
L:  Yeah, but that's like, um -- I would think that would be [several inaudible words] [NOISE] -- more of a personal hangup, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  If you don't do it, that just -- well, that just hurts you.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, it affects your health --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and obviously you're worse off for it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but it doesn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- affect everyone else around you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too much.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  But in -- except for my husband who has to hear me --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- complain about it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but other than that, it's not that big of a deal. [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- boy, I don't know.
L:  Overeating would go in the same category.
R:  Oh, yeah and I'm --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- guilty of that as well. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  For sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think everyone -- like, those are habits that I think everyone has.  Like, nobody -- well, I won't say nobody, but most people don't exercise as much as they sh- --
L:  Mm.  Yeah.
R:  -- as they should and most people overeat --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at least every once in a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So, I don't know, I think most people are guilty of those.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  But um, I don't know what else. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] -- as I say smoking and like you were saying [NOISE] [MN] over indulgence and alcohol --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, gossip is pretty serious too but --
R:  In a different -- I guess it's dif- -- in a different way.
L:  Yes, it is in a different way.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, because I think of gossip as being like serious --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like in a spiritual and emotional --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- way.  Whereas the other ones are more serious in a physical way --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, it's hard to comp- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges in a way.
L:  Basically, I -- that's exactly correct.
R:  So -- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, have you done these calls before?
L:  No, actually this is my first time, so.
R:  Me too.  Me too.
L:  Yeah, so I don't know exactly what to expect.
R:  I know.  I know.  And it's like -- it's like you talk for a few minutes and like, "Okay.  Well --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I think we've discussed that topic". [LAUGH] [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um --
L:  And we're -- they say you have talk for ten minutes, right?
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...  Oh, kitties.  Sorry, my kitties are fighting. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you have cats?  That's nice.
R:  Kitties, kitties, kitties.  [NOISE] Calm down.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Play nicely.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] It's having toddlers in the house sometimes.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love cats.
R:  [LAUGH] Do you have cats?
L:  No, I said, "I love cats" --
R:  Oh, you do?
L:  -- I used to, I don't anymore.
R:  I -- I love these guys, but they get so wound up.  Like, when we get home from work they're so excited to see us --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that they just go crazy.  They're chasing everyone around the house and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- being -- just being nuts. [MN]
L:  That's like my bird --
R:  Yeah?
L:  -- he gets so excited when I come home.
R:  Really?  What does he do?
L:  Oh, she just dance and bob her head around [NOISE] and --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- chirp and [inaudible] --
R:  That's so cute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [several inaudible words] pay attention to her she squawks and fusses.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, boy.  Well, I'm happy because I just got home and my weekend starts right now, I don't have to work tomorrow, so.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  Yeah, that's nice.  It's really nice.  Although it's th- thunder storming outside and they say it's going to ha- -- stay this way all weekend, so.
L:  Yeah, it's thunder storming up here too.
R:  Is it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so bad here, we've been having flash floods and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thunder and lightening all week long.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  What part of Maryland do you live in?
L:  I live in Hyattsville.
R:  Where's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is it like -- is that like near DC or ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's right next to DC.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, I don't know that area that well, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we just moved to Saint Louis from Seattle.  So, kind of a big change.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.  I don't know.  Have you been watching TV tonight? [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  I'm trying to find something [LAUGH] good to watch.
L:  [LAUGH] No, I -- I didn't see anything good on TV.
R:  There's nothing on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's nothing at all on and yet I'm in --
L:  Right.
R:  -- one of those moods where I just want to veg out in front of the television.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's frustrating.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um, [MN] I don't know.  Do you ha- -- what plans do you have for the weekend?
L:  [LAUGH] Um, nothing definite right now.
R:  Yeah?
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  Um, I don't have anything either.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'll try -- I'd like to go see a movie or something, but there's nothing out there that I'm dying to see.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, I don't know.  Ah, have you seen anything good lately?
L:  The Matrix is good.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah, that was really good.
R:  You know, I keep hearing about that and I never saw the first one --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and now I reg- -- now I think, "Oh, I should have seen the first one and then I could, you know, see the second one with everyone else".
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess I could go rent it.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- the first one's good too.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah. [MN] Huh, yeah have y- -- have you seen it yet?
L:  [MN] Oh, the first one?  Mhm.  I have --
R:  Or the second -- and the --
L:  I've seen both.
R:  Oh, have you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Okay.  Are you like one of those hard core fans?
L:  Yes.  Definitely. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  That's cool.  That's cool.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [MN] So, do you work or are you a student or ...?
L:  I work.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  What kind of work do you do?
L:  Reception.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm a librarian.
L:  Oh. [NOISE]
R:  So, yeah ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I work in a, um, college library.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know, trying to think of what else to talk about with ya ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um [MN] --
L:  It -- it seems like they should have given us more to talk about -- to talk for ten minutes.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, did you grow up in Maryland?
L:  Um, yeah.
R:  Yeah?
L:  For the most part.  Mhm.
R:  I've been all over.  I grew up in Missouri but then moved to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- New York and Seattle and California and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all over the place, but now I'm back home, so that's kind of nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, [MN] do you have kids?
L:  No.  No.  Uh-uh.
R:  Yeah, me not -- me ei- -- me neither, I mean. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not yet, at least. [MN] I want some, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- not quite yet.  What about you?  How old -- how old you, just out of curiosity?
L:  I'm twenty one.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, that's what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's about what I thought.
L:  Really?
R:  I don't know.  Yeah, because you sound mature --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but not like -- I don't know, you ju- -- like you sound older than a teenager --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but younger than, like, my mom or something. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  So, [LAUGH] that's a good thing.  I mean, I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I suppose so.
R:  I'm twenty nine, so.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  A little bit older than you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but not that much. [MN] So, I don't know what else.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I'm just trying to think of what I can say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to fill up these last few minutes.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they should have given us a -- a better topic, you know?
R:  Yeah or something a little bit more su- -- meaty and substantial.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like I know when I was -- one of my fr- -- a friend was telling me about this, she said, "Oh, yeah.  They told us to talk about the war in Iraq" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and like -- I mean, you could talk about that for hours --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no problem.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um -- I don't know.  How did you hear about this thing?
L:  Um, [MN] just surfing around different search engines --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and [NOISE] I came across it.  I -- I think -- I'm into g- groups I belong to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in Yahoo.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I think -- [several inaudible words] did they post a link or something?  It was either that or another link I got somewhere else. [LAUGH]
R:  Mm.
L:  I can't remember, I do so much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- surfing around the internet.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Me too.  I think I heard about it, because I -- I'm really into like coupons and refunds and everything --
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- and saving money any way I can.  And I'm on all these message boards where they talk about different ways --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like to make money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- using coupons and refunds --
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and somebody there told me about it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I signed up a couple of weeks ago and I've been meaning to do it, but every time they call me I've been busy or out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so tonight I actually just called in myself and thought, "Well, let me get the first one out of the way and --"
L:  Oh.  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- you know, make a little money" so.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a cool idea.  It's a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I wish I could convince my hus-
