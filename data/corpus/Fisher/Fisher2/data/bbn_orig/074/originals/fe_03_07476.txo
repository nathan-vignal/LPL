L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Hello?
R:  Hello!
L:  Hi!  [NOISE]
R:  My name's Barbara.
L:  [NOISE]  My name's Dawn.  [SIGH]
R:  Hi, Dawn, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm in Utah.  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Marietta, Ohio.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  I'm not too sure --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- I h- heard the question really good.  Did you?
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Something about what s- should be done about Iraq?  About --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- disarming ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  What's going on over there now?
L:  [SIGH]  I don't know.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've worked all weekend so I haven't ...  [SIGH]
R:  I --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- well I haven't been --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- keeping up too much with, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- everything --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- since, you know, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] they s- supposedly started the peacekeeping --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Right, I know my husband -- we went out to dinner tonight -- my husband said, "Well, you know, they're fighting again in Iraq".  And I said, [SIGH] [NOISE] "I hadn't seen the news so I d- didn't -- you know, I wasn't [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  [MN]  Well, I -- I --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- I definitely think, you know, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] I don't know --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was a good thing, I believe --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that w- we went over there.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I think it had --
L:  [SIGH]  I do too.  I feel that way.
R:  -- to be done.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- of course, you can't just --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- g- go over there and --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- get rid of him and leave.
L:  [SIGH]  Hm.  [NOISE]
R:  So, I think that t- the peacekeeping should continue.
L:  [NOISE]  I do -- yes, I feel the same way.
R:  Right  Right.  I -- I feel our presence is needed over there.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  I just don't feel that they'll ever completely disarm them.  I don't feel that that will ever be [SIGH] -- you know, there's never been peace in the middle east.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  That's true.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  And I don't k- -- I think that they're [LAUGH] fighting a losing battle. I mean I -- I believe that they should be there but I [NOISE] just don't s- see, [SIGH] you know, [NOISE] it's kind of, like, w- where's it ever going to end?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Right I -- I really think --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] well, um, no matter what --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- but they've got to get [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- the --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- w- what did they call it?
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [SIGH] somebody to --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- the -- their [SIGH] running --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- force over there -- they're [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, you know, how we have our government set up?
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  They have to get [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think a government [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- e- elected or set up --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- f- from the people.
L:  [SIGH]  R- right.  [NOISE]
R:  You know, not ... p- people --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we picked [SIGH] or, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, 'cause every once in a while --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- they throw in that [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- u- um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we're in charge of who's going --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- to run it and I don't believe that's so.
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  No, I think that they should be allowed to pick [NOISE] but I think they need to, [SIGH] you know, I don't know, like I said I'm not real sure as far as what the answer is but I do b- believe that, you know, they need to [SIGH] -- they need to do something.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I -- I don't believe -- I'm not one of these that says, you know, "Oh, they shouldn't be over there".  I mean [SIGH] -- you know, [MN] I didn't quite understand at first and I have three c- cousins that are stationed over -- over in various parts.  [SIGH] And, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- at first I was like, "Well, you know, I think they're getting into a little -- biting off a little more than they can chew".  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  R- right.
L:  But after what's happened, I mean I definitely understand [SIGH]  [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, I definitely s- see that we needed to go.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  And, I'm with you there.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  And I --
L:  [SIGH]  So, I don't know -- ah, like I said I have no clue as to what the answer is but ...  [SIGH]
R:  I don't want us to --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- stay there forever either, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, because --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- people are missing their family members.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  But, ah, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I think that the presence is needed over there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because [SIGH] i- i- if we just get up and leave --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] then --
L:  [NOISE]  It'll be like, ah, back -- it was back in Desert Storm.
R:  Right and I think --
L:  I -- that's how I feel.  I -- I don't -- I mean I feel that they should've kept a presence over there instead of [SIGH]  [NOISE] --
R:  Well, and with Iran and all of that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right next and [SIGH] Saddam Hu- H- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] what is his -- no, no [SIGH] well I forget what their names are --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but there's a couple over there in, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- u- um, [MN] I- Iran--
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- r- right --
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] a- ah, that are trying to take over and --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, continue this --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] a- ah, continue this --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I don't know however they do that t- terrorist and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- one person, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I [LIPSMACK]  --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R: -- it totally just --
L:  [SIGH]  That's what I told my husband.  I- it got to the point where, you know, [SIGH] there -- at first -- when they first s- started the ward, [SIGH] you know, we were pretty glued to the TV.  [SIGH]  And then it got to the point -- it's like, "I cannot stand ..."  [SIGH] you know, I would, like, watch [SIGH] just a little bit throughout the day but it was like it just got to be m- more than I could stand.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, that -- I was glued to it every day --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- until [SIGH] they actually, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] u- um, you know, quit showing it every day.
L:  [SIGH] Right.
R:  And one reason was because [SIGH] I became sick and I had to stay at home --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] and I really hadn't even had --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- an idea of what was going on because --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- I was working.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  And then when I was sitting here and, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- a- ah, kind of ... c- chair bound -- TV bound for a while --
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] I really got into it.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  But now it's kind of hard to --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I see ... just --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- glimpses every once in a while about [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- knowing that there are still --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- altercations going on --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and that there's still, ah, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- groups of there.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  And, ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- hoping that, you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- they can flush them out and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] hopefully they can find --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- t- that guy, Hussein.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, hopefully they can, [SIGH] you know, do something as far as [NOISE] -- [SIGH] you know, --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- like I said t- they'll never be a [SIGH] [NOISE] -- they'll never completely be at peace I don't believe but ...  [NOISE]
R:  No.  [SIGH]  No, you're right t- the --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- area it is because --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] l- look at +Jerusalem and all that --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's been that way.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  And, ah, --
L:  That's what my husband says.  [NOISE]  He was in the airforce and that's what he says.  He says, "You know what?"  He says, "They'll never [NOISE] ever, ever, [SIGH] [NOISE] be peace in the middle east".  He said, "There never has been.  [NOISE]  They're n- never will be."  [SIGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  And I really didn't know that much about it and he's really set me up on a lot of, [SIGH] you know, [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  On a --
L:  -- set me wise on a lot of it.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  On a lot of what's going on, yeah.
L:  [MN]  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  And that makes sense.  Of course --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- all of my ... r- relatives are --
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  -- well I do have some young nephews and --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- stuff.  They're in --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the services.  [SIGH]  But, ah --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- all of mine that's served in the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- in the for- in the forces, of course, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] they served way before --
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] Desert Storm.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  They were, like, you know, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- ah, Vietnam era and all that.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And --
L:  That's what my dad was.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  And [SIGH] I'm a -- I'm -- I'm one of those ones [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- everybody talked about --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- that era of time and they said --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Well, didn't you do this?" --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I said, "No, I didn't".
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  I was behind --
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] a- ah, you know, they were --
L:  [SIGH]  I was born in sixty eight so when I was born -- when I was three months old [SIGH] dad was shipped to Vietnam.  [NOISE]
R:  Right, and [SIGH] --
L:  So, I only know basically what I -- you know, what I've -- what I've heard.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Well, they went because that's what they were told to do.
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  And they did what they were told to do.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  And [SIGH] a lot of 'em gave their --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- everything for it.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]  And I -- I'm very proud ... and pleased to --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- be a part of that e- era.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  And --
L:  [SIGH]  Well, that's what -- you know, I know a lot of people that I w- work with and stuff, they're saying, "Oh, we're getting into another Vietnam" and it's like [SIGH] [NOISE] you know, "No, they're doing what they have to do.  They're doing it because they have to do it".  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  I work with a lot of young kids and it's like they just don't take their freedom n- nearly serious enough.  It's like, you know, --
R:  No, they don't.
L:  -- [SIGH] they just take it for granted and I'm like, "You know, what guys.  If you really knew, [NOISE] you know, what these people in these other countries are going through you wouldn't take your freedoms for granted".  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [SIGH]  And I have a seven year old daughter and a four year old daughter [SIGH] [NOISE] and we've watched some of the, [NOISE] [SIGH] you know, coverage from Iraq.  [SIGH]  I don't let 'em see a lot of it because I don't think that that's good for 'em.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  But I've let 'em see some of it and I've talked about the [NOISE] conditions, like, that the children live in and [NOISE] stuff.  [SIGH]  And, you know, the fact that they don't have the freedom to ge- -- you know, t- the girls, [SIGH] you know, were not allowed to be schooled [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and things.  And taught them about that and they're like, you know -- so it makes them, [SIGH]  -- you know, my oldest one says, "Momma" she says, "We're r- really lucky we live where we do where we can have all the freedom we do".  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  E- exactly.
L:  And she's very, you know, very appreciative.  [NOISE]  And I said that's the -- that's what I wanted to show 'em [MN] is that they do live in such a wonderful, [SIGH] -- you know, everybody talks about how bad it is but it's like we c- could have it a l- lot worse than we do.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, ... definitely.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, it's -- [SIGH] I -- I --
L:  [SIGH]  So, I -- like I said --  [NOISE]
R:  I think we should continue what we're doing.
L:  I do too.  [NOISE]  Like I said that's -- [SIGH] that's very much [NOISE] the way I feel.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  And that's -- that's --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- my opinion on it and I don't think we should be pulled out.
L:  [NOISE]  No.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  And, ah --
L:  And I don't think -- like I said, I -- I at first wasn't, you know, I [SIGH] -- I don't know  [NOISE] I was -- ah, kind of like, "Well, you know, I don't -- I think we're biting off more than we can chew".  [NOISE]  But it's like now I see [NOISE] w- the whole picture and it's like I see now [SIGH] -- I'm not one of these that says we shouldn't be there.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  Well, one of the things --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, yo- -- there has been --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] this type of thing, them coming over and the --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] well, the bombings and the c- car blows up and --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] all of that has been going on --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the middle east for years.
L:  [SIGH]  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And -- and it's been happening here --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] but not as --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- until [SIGH] the Twin Towers --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  -- did it make such a --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  That woke pe- -- that really woke people up, though.  [NOISE]  I mean as far as, --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, because we're always thought terrorism was something [SIGH] that happened --
R:  Elsewhere.
L:  -- overseas.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]  And that opened people's [NOISE] eyes and made 'em realize, "Hey, you know, we're not entirely safe".  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh, exactly.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  And I think ... you know --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- ah, ... [SIGH] that is --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- one of the reasons when --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] this came up I'm going, --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, [SIGH] "How else?"  [SIGH]  T- they -- they put these -- all these restraints --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on fighting terrorism --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  -- all this -- all this time.  [SIGH]  And --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] t- they had to wait until they --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] d- did something like that so that we could --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- a- actually get back and g- get into it.
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Right.
R:  I mean, [SIGH] a- ah, that's a big p- price to pay.
L:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  So, I am f- for -- for it t- thoroughly.  [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely.  I definitely support our troops and I ju- -- support the decision that's been -- you know, that are President's made.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Exactly.  [SIGH]  I mean you can't --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- stay out of --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- of things like that all the time --
L:  [SIGH]  And that's what I told --
R:  -- you just can't.
L:  And that's what I told a couple of the kids I work with.  They said something.  I said, "Well, you know what, you have an option.  If you don't like the way things are going, pack your bags and leave".  [SIGH]  You know ...
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I mean that's how I feel.  It's like, you know, ...  [SIGH]
R:  And don't bother to try to come back after it's over.
L:  [SIGH]  E- exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  E- r- right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, a- ah, [SIGH] I -- I --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- worked in a j- --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- worked in a job where [SIGH] I talk --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- to a lot of people from all over.  And a lot of [SIGH] --
