L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yep.
R:  [NOISE]  Um, what do you like about Christmas?
L:  [NOISE]  I don't know.  I guess I'm kind of ... C- Christian.  I don't know.  [MN]  I just really like it because it's a time that everyone's happy.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I like Halloween 'cause it's -- 'cause you don't have to buy anybody anything.  [LAUGH]

R:  [NOISE]

L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  That's cool.
R:  They have p- parades and ... [SIGH] costume ... parties and stuff like that.  [SIGH]
L:  So, they celebrate a lot for Halloween?
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  I don't really plan on going anywhere special for Christmas.  Just sitting at home.

L:  Huh.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Do you have any -- do you -- what's your -- like, what's your second favorite holiday?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, [SIGH] --

R:  -- I'd have to say the Fourth of July.  [MN]
L:  [COUGH]  Oh, [NOISE] [SIGH] yeah, that's cool.  [NOISE]  That one's coming up soon.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And maybe it represents the patriotism.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [PAUSE]  [SIGH]  I have to say I l- like ... Thanksgiving ... second.  [NOISE]
R:  Why's that?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  A- ah, you get to eat a lot.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  And there's no present there either.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  I can't --
R:  [SIGH]  Well --
L:  -- imagine how -- I can't imagine what it would be like to be Jewish --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- because then you -- then you have to pass out -- what a present every day [NOISE] for how -- is it eleven days?
R:  I think it's seven.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- yeah, 'cause that -- [NOISE] that's not good.  [NOISE]  That's a bit expensive.
R:  And like [MN] -- it's not that I don't like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- giving people stuff it's just that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know [SIGH] it just seems like ... the whole point of the holidays becomes just to get --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- just to buy stuff.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah, it's a good feeling giving away presents but it's not cheap.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  I like receiving presents myself.
R:  Me too.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  [MN]
L:  [MN]  A- [SIGH] also I -- I like ... New Years.

L:  [NOISE]  Yep --
R:  I usually don't --
L:  -- I just don't --
R:  -- celebrate it that much though.  [SIGH]
L:  Huh.  What did you say?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I like it because it ends the year and starts -- starts with a new fresh life.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]  [PAUSE]  Ah, do you have another favorite holiday?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  U- um, [LIPSMACK] [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not really.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]

R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Especially if you're not religious.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I really like +Christmas mostly not because I give but because I receive.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I wish I was Jewish.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Me too.
L:  Yeah, that'd be cool.
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And then I could have a bar mitzvah too.
R:  [NOISE]  What's that?
L:  [NOISE]  Huh?  [NOISE]
R:  What did you say?  [SIGH]
L:  Like -- like, um, [NOISE] -- and then you get lots of presents then.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Easter, that's a little -- that's a little -- my parents used to tell me [MN] about the Easter Bunny --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was just like, "Okay".
R:  Hm.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We used to have Easter egg hunts but ... now that I'm older I don't ... f- feel --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- anything for Easter really.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  So, it's [NOISE] kind of boring.
L:  [NOISE]  Yep.  [NOISE]  It used to be fun --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but not any more.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Yeah, one year we -- we didn't -- we didn't find all the eggs.  [NOISE]  And they -- they actually had hard boiled eggs and that wasn't good.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  We just had plastic ones [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- with stuff in 'em --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, change or candy.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Did you -- did you ever get any cavity, like, around Halloween?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  No, [SIGH] not, really.  [NOISE]
L:  Did you ea- -- did you ever eat a lot candy --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- fo- -- on Halloween?
R:  [NOISE]  Oh, yeah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of course.
L:  And w- who didn't?  [NOISE]
R:  Huh?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  I rem- -- I remember I used to get [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the one time I -- I got a can of peas and it was like, [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- "Oh, that's -- that makes my day".  [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  It's like Halloween's just asking -- just telling everyone to go out and get rotten teeth.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I mean they say it rots your teeth, but I haven't got a rotten teeth -- I haven't got a rotten tooth because of it yet.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Stop it.  [NOISE]  You -- you're ruining my chat -- my patience.  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  No, get 'em off.  [NOISE]  Huh?  No.  [NOISE]  Yep, Christmas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't -- I always receive a lot of presents on Christmas.  That was fun.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE]  My favorite Christmas present was p- probably ... I'd say a camcorder.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  That's a good present.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, I love it.  It was so cool.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Last year for Christmas I got a ... one of those doll houses that you have to put together.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  I'm still working on it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I just put the roof together yesterday.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh!  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  It's like three stories t- tall.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE]  [COUGH]  Yep, [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] in the past I've --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gotten quite [NOISE] a few good Christmas presents.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I'd say the camcorder's the best.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The second -- the second best was probably, ah, Play Station Two.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
