R:  Ceryl.
L:  Hi, my name is Jessica[?].
R:  I'm Ceryl[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Jessica. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi, Jessica.
L:  Hi.
R:  What do you think's the worst?
L:  I have to go with gossiping, because --
R:  I didn't -- you know what?  I didn't even hear em say gossiping, but that is a good one.
L:  Oh, I thought it was the first one.
R:  Oh, it probably was.  I couldn't hear very well.
L:  Oh, there was a bunch and they went pretty fast, um --
R:  Oh, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] I think it's probably the worst --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because like with the other ones like smoking and chewing and not exercising, you just harm yourself, but with gossiping --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you affect a lot of other people and I think that's like the worst [several inaudible words].
R: That's excellent.  Very good.  Um, it -- same here [NOISE] because you can -- that's your habit, smoking and drinking and that's affecting you just like you said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, you know, I smoke so I -- I thought for sure you was going to say smoking. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But um, I -- gossiping does hurt other people and I totally agree.
L:  Yeah and, I mean -- um, I think things like -- um, with the technology that we have nowadays --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, smoking well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is an example, I guess and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- chewing tobacco and not exercising, with the things we know today about how it harms our bodies, I don't understand why people would deliberately do that.  I mean, I know that there's, um, addiction problems and that's certainly an issue, but with not exercising kind of thing, um, I -- it just seems, kind of, voluntarily harming yourself.
R:  It is.  It really is and, um -- but they have so many treatment programs and even with smoking you can get hypnotized and, um, every -- ah -- that's all -- they're warning us about cancer and they're try- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, and people's getting scared from it and so many people's dying of cancer and even with overweight, it's just so bad.
L:  I totally agree.
R:  Um -- yeah, me too.  But ah -- let me see, what else?  Well -- like overeating, now I never have done that, I've always been able to eat what I wanted --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but I've known people that have -- that have like an eating addiction and, um, again this person actually needed help, so.  He -- he --
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- oh, go ahead.
R:  Go ahead.  No, go ahead. [NOISE]
L:  Um, I think binge eating is probably, um, just as much of a problem as, um --
R:   [NOISE]
L:  -- smoking, I think, because you know the effects of it and you continue to do it and you know it's -- it's not good for you but you just can't stop and I think that's how binge eating relates to the other things.
R:  Yeah and, ah, also again they're -- they got so many, um, help out there, but with gossiping that's just like an everyday thing and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, you can't -- you do, you hurt other people and it -- it's a -- a -- you know, I -- the -- I worked in an office of about five people.  As soon as one walked out, the other one would talk about you.  So, I totally agree with that and it does hurt, because I've walked back in being talked about and it's like I've just wanted to leave.
L:  Yeah.  And, I mean -- like the other personal habits that they mentioned at the beginning of our conversation, those things are, um -- [LAUGH] they don't -- I guess, you know they're there and you know the truth of them.  I mean, if you smoke, you know you smoke and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you have an eating disorder, you know you have an eating disorder --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but when o- -- but when other people gossip about you and you hear gossip or you tell gossip, um [NOISE] sometimes you're not even conscious of it but you don't get the facts and I think, um, gossiping is a terrible habit [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think that peop- -- I think people do fall into it.  They -- they don't mean to, but they fall into it anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] just because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's something to say.
R:  Right or they just like to agree with the other person and make em happy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to be friends with everyone.  I know a lot people that does that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [NOISE] I mean, it happens in -- in my neighborhood.  My one neighbor will go talk about the other one and the other one cal- -- you know, and they [several inaudible words] and it's like, "Who -- you know --"
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  "-- why are you talking about each other like that?" --
L:  And --
R:  -- then to your face the- --
L:  -- they're polite to their face.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, they're bes- -- your best friend.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they -- it's just [inaudible] you don't know who to believe or who to trust anymore --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's sad.  It -- it's sad.
L:  Yeah.
R: Becau- -- and it also can hurt because you know, I have a young daughter and, you know, when things -- ah, kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they hurt each other so bad with gossiping.  And it's like my daughter doesn't look --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just like me and it's like, "She's adopted" and I know she's not adopted, you know, and that really hurts her.
L:  [several inaudible words] [NOISE] --
R:  I said, "No, I -- [several inaudible words]" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, she's grown up with that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot in her life because -- just because she's a little bit darker than I am --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and that's sad.
L:  I bet she's beautiful though.
R:  Because he's got dark hair and I've got blonde hair --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [MN] And, um, it really hurts her and she's always defending herself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I said, "You don't have to defend yourself.  I know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- you know, your mommy and daddy had you" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  [MN] But it does hurt an awful lot from children --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- up to adults.
L:  I know and, um -- I mean, I know that, um [NOISE] -- I think gossiping is [NOISE] -- um, [MN] I think little kids [NOISE] are affected personally more by it --
R:  Yes.  Mhm.
L:  -- [NOISE] but -- but I think that adults, um [NOISE] -- they have the ability to choose to do it.  And I don't --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- think it's -- I don't think a child, um [NOISE] has -- I mean, at a very young age, I don't think they have any ability to decipher whether they're not harming another individual [NOISE] by what they say, unless they've been trained that way.
R:  [NOISE] Well, now see I don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right, I don't know about that because I always -- I've always taught her, "You don't hurt other people" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  "If you gotta say something --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you don't -- you don't do it to other people to hurt em.  Keep it --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- to yourself".  So, I do -- you know --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you gotta raise your child --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- too -- appropriately.  Because some --
L:  Oh, I totally agree.
R:  I mean -- I mean, kids out here just have such a bad mouth --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they just hurt --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they don't re- -- they don't -- they don't care if they hurt a lot of em.
L:  No. [NOISE]
R:  And, ah, for a child to be hurt, they're just an innocent --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I -- gossiping affects us all.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it does.
R:  It surely does.
L:  And, you know, it can start -- it's like a chain, it can start [NOISE] at one end [NOISE] and it can go through twenty people --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- and if you're the last per- -- if you're the last person --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you get one hundred percent completely different story --
R:  Ah, yes.
L:  -- and -- and if you were to take it back to the first person, I think that's how you decipher whether or not you're being gossiped to [NOISE] because if you have a completely --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- different story than the people before you, you know [NOISE] something's not right.
R:  Oh, I know.  Ah, that is so true and it's like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it -- ah, you know, say a person quit --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] they got fired for [LAUGH] you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, sleeping with the boss or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, for example and it -- it was totally untrue --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but that's how gossiping starts.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're absolutely right.  Well --
L:  And I think if people [NOISE] um, took the effort to verify [NOISE] what they hear before they pass it on, um, [NOISE] I don't think that it would be as big as a prob- -- big of a problem as it is.
R:  Right.  Right. [NOISE] I agree.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE] But everybody's so lazy, they're -- they aren't willing put out [NOISE] the effort -- the effort to verify anything or check into anything. [NOISE]
R:  That's true.  It is true.
L:  They just put in their two cents worth of spreading and let it go from there. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Right.  And they -- um, like you say, it hurts --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, even, ah, like my child when she was two.  I walked --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on this -- we were walking in [several inaudible words] and this huge person come to- -- you know, walking towards us and she said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "Look how fat she is mommy" well, I almost died.  So, I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, but when we got past her -- because it had to hurt her feelings I -- I stooped --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I sat and talked to her.  I said, "That was not nice" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I said, "You know, that woman's probably in her car crying" and, um, you know, from -- from then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I remember that, from two trying to teach her different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- than that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  But I mean -- ah, it was like -- it was so embarassing to me.  I was like, "Oh, my God.  You didn't" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH] But um a lot of children they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well, they tell it like they see it.
L:  Yeah, [NOISE] no kidding.
R:  And they don't know how to hold their tongue. [NOISE] But --
L:  And, like you said, unless they're brought up differently, they have no reason --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to think that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they're doing anything that's not right.
R:  Right.
L:  And I don't -- I don't think it's so much -- um, I think gossiping [NOISE] in most people is a bad habit.  But I -- then I think there's those instances --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where people just don't know any [NOISE] better.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I just --
R:  Well, also- -- yeah.  Also, you know, if the parents do it the child's going to follow. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] And, um, that's a terrible thing, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it happens a lot.
L:  Yeah, it does.
R:  I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, you have any other input?
L:  Hm. [NOISE] I don't know how much longer this thing is.
R:  I know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't think it's [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that it should be that much --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, it should be up pretty soon.
R:  But like as far as smoking --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- I mean, I never used to like the smoke --
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and now I -- and I could quit very easily --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now it's real hard for me to quit.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, I'm gonna actually go get hypnotized.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I really wanna do it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for my child, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, they're teaching em so much in school about that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and she'll bring the literature home and it's like, "Oh, gosh" you know?  It makes you look [NOISE] like you're bad --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- but it's just that they're -- it's just a habit.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  And, um, my dad has smoked from the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I was a little kid and [NOISE] um, c- [NOISE] -- and my mom smokes, but she quit.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But my -- my
