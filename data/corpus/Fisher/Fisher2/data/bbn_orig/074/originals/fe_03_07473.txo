L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  My name's William.
L:  Hi, William.  I'm Melanie.
R:  Hi, Melanie. [MN]
L:  Hi.
R:  Ah, how do you like the topic?
L:  Well, disarming Iraq?  [LAUGH] That's the topic, right?
R:  Oh, they told me it was going to be reality TV.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, mine said disarming Iraq.
R:  Wow, that's strange.  You know what happened?  I got a phone call at eight o'clock exactly.  That's the time I set up, from eight to twelve --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and they -- they set somebody up and they said introduce yourself and they hung up on me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  So, I called back and I had the number, you know, the punch in with your pin number --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and I did that and they said the topic was going to be reality TV.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think the topic for this call is, um, what do you think the US should do about disarming Iraq.
R:  Okay, prob- -- I think you're probably right.  Ah --
L:  Aren't they already disarmed?
R:  [MN] Not really.  Ah, there's still [inaudible] fighting out there.  My sister's, ah, fiance is out there.  He just got --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  He got called in there about two months ago.  They were waiting all this time to go out there.  He's actually an air traffic controller and, ah, they were ambushed a couple of days ago.  So, they're still fighting.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  I guess most of it's over naturally but, ah, there's little pockets all over the place.  It's a funny country.  There's so many different nationalities or sects, I guess they call them, and, ah, there's still a lot of people loyal to, ah, Hussain.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I imagine though most of the stuff is over with for the most part, so ...
L:  Yeah.  It seems like all the coordinated efforts would -- would be over.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But now it just seems like there's -- I -- I guess, like what you said, there's little pockets of kind of rebels and ...
R:  Yeah, I think -- I think some, ah, soldier got killed yesterday.  He was ambushed.
L:  That's too bad.
R:  Yeah. [MN] Oh, it was over pretty quick anyway.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you, ah, do you believe we should have been out there in the first place?
L:  Um, [MN] I don't know.  I mean, I'm kind of glad that we did it.
R:  Ahah.
L:  I think it was one of those big question marks where it was always kind of something that was looming over our shoulders.  What -- what is Hussain gonna do?  And he's so crazy --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and unpredictable.  I mean, it's nice to have him out of the picture now.
R:  Right, hopefully, if they could find him.  Unless he tries to come back.  You never know with them people.  H- he -- it's strange the UN doesn't do anything about stuff like that though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you think -- you think they would of stepped in and did something, so it's -- that's what I can't figure out why --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- we have to go in and do it.
L:  -- it seemed like for the longest time that they were pretty positive that he was dead and then, I guess, lately they've said, n- no, something about one of the sons or something was the last I heard about that.
R:  Ahah.
L:  One of the sons w- -- like, went into hiding.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  That was the rumor I guess.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  He might have easily escaped because I think France is helping some of these people get out of there too.  They're giving them passports.
L:  Oh.
R:  So ... [MN] It's funny.  I -- I had a guy from France yesterday.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yeah.  [MN] It was a terrible connection.  It was like in a tunnel.  So, I caught about half of what he said.  It was --
L:  Was he in France?  Or he was French?
R:  Yes, right from -- no, right from France.
L:  Wow.  What did he have to say? [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, our topic yesterday was reality TV. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And neither one of us watches that so it was -- we got into Iraq after a while.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  We switched over ourselves.  We had nothing left to talk about reality TV.  We both hated it, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  But, ah, he -- he was a typical French opinion, I guess.  He was all for being against the US.  They're blaming us for being aggressors and things like that.  I- it was sorta strange, you know, I -- I --
L:  Well, we were definitely the gr- -- the aggressor in this instance -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- instance.  That's for sure.  I mean, nothing really provoked us moving in there.  We just did it. [MN] So ...
R:  It was the possible threat.  They haven't found the weapons yet but there was -- I think there's a good chance there are weapons of mass destruction out there. [MN] They had plenty of time to disarm it and hide it and everything like that.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, the -- the UN was fooling around for so long.  They should have rushed in there with a whole bunch of people and, ah, investigated it.  They had plenty of time to disarm and hide and do everything.
L:  Yeah, they debated it for the longest time.
R:  Yeah --
L:  So ... 
R:  -- 'cause he even killed some of the scientists that he had.  You know, to -- to kill the trail.  I think it said scientists, chemical science.  He, ah, had the guy killed 'cause the guy was trying to escape.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Boy, he's just so brutal.  I hope --
R:  He's crazy.
L:  -- he's dead.  
R:  Yeah.  He- he's a lunatic just like that guy in, ah, Uganda, ah, Idi Amin.  Same thing.  These guys are total lunatics.
L:  Ah, I think the guy in North Korea is also out of his mind.
R:  Yeah, I don't know his name.  I can't pronounce it.
L:  I can't -- I don't know his name either but he's obviously crazy too.
R:  It's scary that they have access to atomic weapons and that.
L:  I know.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And he's blatantly said, "If we're attacked we'll use nuclear weapons". [LAUGH] He said that right after we went into, um, [LIPSMACK] right after we went into Iraq.  
R:  Ahah, yeah.  Ah, it is scary, you know.  You really can't, you don't know what Bush is really -- all the information they had.  They're not going to give it out to everybody so, he knows a lot more than the normal people do.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm sure they had -- I'm sure they had a pretty good reason for going in there the way they did.  I would hope so anyway, you know. [MN]
L:  Yeah, I would think so.
R:  I- it is scary.
L:  Maybe was -- maybe Hussain was helping terrorists or --
R:  Oh, I -- I'm sure he --
L:  -- al Qaeda.
R:  -- yeah, I'm sure he was.  If you recall maybe five or six years ago, they attacked that one country, Libya.  The guy was --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- crazy -- ah, Mohammed or whatever his name is.  But, ah --
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  -- they almost killed him.  Ah, especially after the terrorist attack here.  You never know what they're gonna do.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...  Um, I'm sort of glad they did it after it was all over with.  At first I was sorta hesitant and nobody wants to see a war go on but ...
L:  I think we were just all nervous 'cause no one wants to see anything long --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you don't want to sustain heavy losses.
R:  Yeah, like Vietnam was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, yeah, these little quick -- I mean, it's relatively very quick and very few losses and --
R:  Yeah, [COUGH] I'm surprised we didn't have more allies though, except for Britain and maybe Poland and a couple of other countries gave a little bit of help but the vast majority of people didn't help us at all which is really --
L:  I can't believe the French.  Ah!
R:  Yeah.
L:  They bug me.
R:  Well, I've read a lot on that, you know, when it started.  They were selling a lot of stuff to Iraq.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, Russia had the most sales of machinery and weaponry and, ah, atomic uranium and things like that.  France was second.  They had a real --
L:  [MN] Russia didn't want us in there either.
R:  Right.  Well, they had a good deal.  Th- -- I think they said something like, ah, a fantastic amount of billions of dollars they were selling them and France was up there too.  So, they had a good deal going, ah, you know, helping their economy.
L:  Right.
R:  Both their economies are really, you know, crappy right now so, they probably wanted to see 'em stay open.
L:  I read a -- I read some article about what the tourism -- you know, how the tourism is so down now in Paris.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah, 'cause no Americans are going there.  I guess --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- it's awful.
R:  Oh.  Oh.  I don't blame the people though either, you know, ah, I don't think it's all the people, the normal people, just some of the leaders.  It's -- it's politics. 
L:  Right.
R:  Like, the leaders, ah -- everybody blames the entire country but I don't think it's all the people.  
L:  Well, did you see that, um, when Serena Williams was playing in the French Open?
R:  No, I --
L:  They booed her.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Huh.
L:  The French booed her.  And she was playing against, um, the girl that she was playing against wasn't French but she was French speaking.  I'm not sure --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- sure where she was from.
R:  Ahah.
L:  But they were basically cheering.  Serena started crying at the end 'cause she felt so bad about it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They would cheer every time she missed something and just heckle her.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, [MN] they're pretty --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- angry.  I don't know why.  They're so -- ah!
R:  Ah, probably because of the press they get from our country.  You know, we're boycotting -- we're talking about boycotting everything French and --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- how bad the French are.
L:  Freedom fries.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think the majority of people are like that though.  I- it's politics, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then, of course, you got idiots like Jane Fonda going over there and sticking up for the people and she's another --
L:  Yeah, and, um, oh, who was that other guy that just did it too, that director?
R:  Sean Penn.  Sean Penn.
L:  No that, um --
R:  Oh, Morrissey or --
L:  Woody Allen.
R:  Which one?
L:  Woody Allen.  Woody Allen.
R:  Woody Allen?
L:  He tried to -- he, like, did a commercial about everybody should go back to.
R:  Oh, I heard about that.  I never --
