L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Eric.  Who am I talking to?
R:  Uh, my name is Barb --
L:  H- ...
R:  -- and I'm in Missouri.
L:  Missouri.  Oh, Pennsylvania myself.  Hi, Barbara.
R:  Pennsylvania.
L:  How are ya?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  [LAUGH] So, why do you think that talk show hosts are, um -- reality shows are popular?
R:  Uh, because different people watch 'em.  [LAUGH]  I don't know.  I shouldn't have said that.  Do you watch them?
L:  We've watched some.  Um, my spouse and I have watched -- well, I got sort of hooked up into 'em when -- back in -- when they first started Survivor, um, my --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my wife and my cousin -- or nephew -- nephew in law I guess it is -- was -- he was staying with us for the summer doing intern work and so we let him live with us for the summer 'cause he wasn't from the area and so they got into the show in a big way and then I got sucked into it to some extent --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and was watching that.  But I kinda grew away from 'em.  I've -- I've seen that -- some of the Survivor series.  I've seen the American Idol series.  Um, I've kinda bounced around on different shows that have come up just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- peeking, never really all that involved and, um ...
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't watch them at all, um ...
L:  Why not?
R:  I watched M.T.V. back when they had Real World --
L:  [LAUGH] That ...
R:  -- but occasionally.  [LAUGH]
L:  I forgot about Real World.  That's right.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  The precursor.
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I -- I -- I don't think they're reality.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know?  They really aren't.  I think it's, um [MN] -- well, now they even go as far as to say that they look for people with certain backgrounds who, you know, can, uh, compete in certain, uh, types of situations and so on.
L:  Who are willing to take their clothes off or ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  I think you're right.  Most, uh -- you're smarter than most of the people watching because they aren't reality.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Now, what I consider reality and what I do watch are the true crime shows like Forensic Files and things like that.  That to me is reality.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  But, uh, as far as Survivor, American Idol, uh -- I don't even know -- Big Brother.  I don't know what some of the others are -- how --
L:  Yeah.  There's ...
R:  -- probably a million- uh -- the bachelor thing -- I think that's all really silly.
L:  There's so many of 'em I wouldn't even know what to, uh -- what the list is.  I know they were talking at one point about a reality [LAUGH] T.V. channel because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there was so many of 'em, which scared the crap outta me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Now, I don't know if Cops falls into reality T.V., but I --
L:  You know -- and I --
R:  -- I like that too.
L:  -- I watch, um -- there's a, um [LIPSMACK] -- a poker tournament series that's on now where the ...
R:  Oh, the world poker tour?
L:  Yes.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I watch that and that's reality T.V. I guess.  I don't know what they mean by -- what's the definition of reality T.V. is.  I -- I guess we should ...
R:  I don't either.  But I've seen that occasionally.  It surprises me that people are so young in those tournaments, they're so ...
L:  Well, a lotta them are getting online from what I understand too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and winning online then winning their way into the tournaments and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a lotta peop- -- I know when I play poker -- I've played poker in the casinos and -- on the east coast in Atlantic City and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's a whole mix of people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even at one table, ages twenty one to eighty one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like they tend to be fairly democratic as far as the ages of people involved.  I guess everybody can play poker supposedly.
R:  Yeah.  Well, back to our topic.
L:  Right.
R:  I -- I think that, um -- that people are in such bizarre situations in reality shows that, uh, it becomes entertainment.
L:  Well, I agree and I -- but I also think that people -- there's -- at least in my opinion there seems to be an impression that reality shows more than other shows are shows that people can place themselves in because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they're supposedly real people.
R:  That's true.  Yeah.
L:  So, unlike a drama or a comedy or whatever, um, that are scripted and have recognizable names and blah, blah, blah --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- they have supposedly just grabbing people who randomly got picked for the reality shows, right?
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And who were placed in the show to do the -- whatever act they had to do and therefore anybody could do it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I -- we look at some of the people -- I haven't seen that much of a variety of personalities involved or, uh, looks involved or whatever, um ...
R:  Well, that's a good point, you know, uh, one most of the shows like Survivor and -- and The Bachelor shows and the -- yeah, they're pretty people and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when you, uh -- my impression and what I've read about them not having watched them really is that some of them are wanting to be in, uh, movies, you know, T.V. stars, they're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in, uh, acting school or, you know, they're just your wanna be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and this is a way to get exposure.  Kind of like the old game shows used to be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think game shows have gotten to the point where now they are ordinary people who, uh -- and to me those are reality shows.
L:  Yeah.  I guess -- I'm not sure if reality show by definition if their intention is to describe it as a sneak peek into a quote, unquote real life --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or a normal life flow scenario as in -- as opposed to a game show where you're in there and you're in for a certain time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you -- you hit the structure and you hit the, um [LIPSMACK] -- what's the word I'm looking for?  You're hitting the -- you have a prize or -- or a certain time limit or a certain, uh, scenario that you go through and you're done and reality T.V. shows tend to be if you live a normal life day to day experience in these unusual circumstances what you do and let's get camera angles in every bathroom and like ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Now, that's a good point because Real World was a reality show --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, so -- so they say --
L:  And for -- one of the first ones.
R:  -- you know, and I think it was because they got into arguments and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- uh, but Survivor is a game show, uh ...
L:  Even though it's presented as a reality show or ...
R:  Yeah.  But that's not real.  I mean, how many real people live on Borneo and ...
L:  Eating bugs.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I think I agree with you there, um ...
R:  The only one -- now, there is one that I watched a couple of years ago and I don't even -- I think it's still on, uh, Fear Factor.
L:  Yeah, it's still out there.  It's, uh ...
R:  Uh, but it used to be scary things.  Now I think it's like just eating worms and stuff like that.
L:  How many gross things we could subject you to.
R:  Yeah.  I -- when I -- I think that's what it was that I watched, uh, where they went through haunted buildings and things like that.  I'm -- I'm not sure.  Then there's another show that I have watched, which I consider reality.  It's called the It Factor and that's kind of interesting.  That's --
L:  That's a show?
R:  -- that's -- that is a show.
L:  That sounds familiar, although ...
R:  It's called the It Factor and it's, um, um, uh, again, wannabees in -- in the, uh, entertainment world, but it's showing them what they go through to get jobs in the business --
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, that's right.
R:  -- and I think that is --
L:  I did hear about that.
R:  -- I think that is good because, I mean, like they go for their calls, they go for rehearsals, they go for, you know, uh, all sorts of things to get work and then what they have to do in the meantime it shows that too.  It's kinda interesting.
L:  Stark realis- -- or stark realism reality show.
R:  Yeah, the reality is.  Yeah.
L:  That might serve a purpose that way making -- realizing it's not that easy to do what they do.
R:  Yeah, um, uh, every waiter in Los Angeles is a budding star, right?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible] I think that, uh, at least in my mind, the other -- another reason that people enjoy watching 'em -- the general public enjoys watching 'em so much -- and why I get so bored with them -- is that it's the voyeurism factor, either --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, what can we see people do much like I guess trash talk T.V. --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Jerry --
R:  Oh, yeah, I don't watch those either.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- Springer show and things like that it's natural obstacles of that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, Jerry Springer going to p- prime time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- s- -- disguising the event, uh, where people wanna see people do certain things on television or do gross things, you know, what they can get away with doing or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things along those lines.  I -- I ...
R:  Yeah.  And they -- it's so concocted now.  When he started his show it was like it could really be true, but now it's just, you know, the expectant explosion.  I -- I don't watch him anymore.  I did watch him when it was new to T.V.
L:  What, Jerry?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mhm.  But I have a cousin that watches the shows all the time and she wants us to make up some kinda story so that we can go on.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, I'm a -- like a Phil Donahue fan and an Oprah fan and I've actually been to Oprah's show and that's -- that's a reality show.
L:  Are you a Dr. Phil fan?
R:  Yeah.  I am actually.  Yeah.
L:  My wife is a big Dr. Phil fan.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I, uh -- I didn't wanna be because [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know -- you know, he's a formula guy, but he's sensible.  I mean, he just -- he just tells ya the way it is and I like that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I guess that could be --
R:  It's not ...
L:  -- considered -- well, is that a reality show or reality talk show?  I -- I think talk shows by definition quote, unquote -- well, actually they're not really reality either, at least some of 'em, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Jerry with a staged ...  My brother's up with the midget wrestler, K.K.K. member whose --
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [LAUGH] from alien Mars or whatever.  I remember -- the one I remember the most of -- or the most vivid one that I had in my mind was when Jerry -- I stumbled across it one afternoon by accident and unfortunately stayed there and it was midget -- K.K.K. members versus midget -- some version of the Black Panthers or something like that --
R:  Mm, my.
L:  -- and, of course, they had a brawl on stage and, you know --
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was different than the other do you know I slept with your brother's wife thing?  But anyway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the reality is becoming more and more skewed and [LAUGH] [inaudible].
R:  Well, and I think that's, uh, a reality that it's becoming more unreal every day and that what started as reality T.V. is now becoming sitcoms and that we won't have what we call now reality T.V. much longer because, I mean, what are they going to do?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, all the topics are [LAUGH] -- there aren't that many topics, uh ...
L:  I guess there aren't --
