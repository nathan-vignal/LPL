R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  My name is Sandra.
L:  Hi, I'm Tiffany.
R:  Hi, Tiffany, where are you from?
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, I live in LA.
R:  Okay.  I live in, um, Northern California.  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay.  [NOISE]  Do you, um, watch --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- very much ... reality TV?
L:  [SIGH]  Ah, no I do not.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, no!  [LAUGH]  I don't either.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean I -- I've watched -- I was praying that the other person [LAUGH] -- um, [LIPSMACK] I don't watch a whole bunch of TV any more, in fact I've, um, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I -- well I -- at -- I have to say I did watch the --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- Survivor program for a little while when it was first -- you know, the first year --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I caught, ah, caught a few ... um, shows [SIGH] but I've moved and started a new life and I -- I -- one of the things that I've cut out is TV.  [SIGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  So, ah, w- we'll just have to wing it.  Have you ever seen the show at all?  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Um, no, I haven't, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't really watch that much TV either [SIGH] but especially reality I just don't.  [SIGH]  I don't get the hoopla of reality shows.  Um, I don't know, it's just [SIGH] -- and the other part of the question is why it's so popular to -- to audiences is because [SIGH] people are just -- I think the -- general public is just nosey.  And [LAUGH] they --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- kind of want to know, you know, like, [NOISE] what's going on in other people's lives and, [SIGH] like, traditional sitcoms, that kind of, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, not really r- reality.  A lot of people don't, you know, have the perfect relationship or the perfect kids of whatever.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, you know, when they i- introduce reality TV shows where, you know, with real people like you and I and [SIGH] with real problems then people really [MN] kind of tuned into that because it was different.  And now it's like people are hooked to [SIGH] -- to Survivor or Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire, or just different things like that because it's -- I think it's [SIGH] more -- dealing with real issues and, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know, people are not really acting [SIGH] they're like, you know, really having these problems or whatever.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  So, um, but I -- I don't get into reality --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- TV shows.  I'm -- [SIGH] my reality is just good [LAUGH] enough so I don't -- I don't need to watch someone else's on television.  [NOISE]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, that --
L:  To say that.
R:  -- that's what I was going to say.  I was going to say, um, you know, I just got out of this dead end marriage of twenty five years.  [SIGH]  Um, I think most ... people who, you know, really groove on those shows are [SIGH] bored.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  You know, they -- they're in there -- they're you know, they've got their problems in their lives and [SIGH] b- -- they're in ruts [SIGH] and, um, they get this -- you know, the -- like you said, they get to peek in [SIGH] to somebody elses, you know, persona, other people's problems.  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  And it takes them away --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from their own mundane existence.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I -- you know, I've even gotten to the point -- it's very interesting [SIGH] um, I --you know, we can make this conversation as f- fun as we want.  [SIGH]  Um, I not only cut out TV [SIGH] but I really limit -- I'm a reading te- -- actually, I'm a reading specialist.  [SIGH]  I really have cut out reading ... these novely kind of books --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] -- that I used to enjoy quite a bit actually.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  And some of it is really good literature too, but I've cut it out because [SIGH] I wanted to do more writing on my own.  [SIGH]  Um, rather than me spending hours reading about somebody else's fantasies and other people's characters, [SIGH] I'm trying to take a more proactive look at life myself.  So, I can come up with the language, you know.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And, um, it's just opened my eyes and made life more interesting for me.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, what exactly are reading specialists?  Ah, what exactly do you -- do you do with that?  That's your job title or ...?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, I teach, ah, in the middle -- I work with a -- a, um -- a little school district here in -- in Sant- -- in Sonoma County.
L:  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I -- I train the teachers [SIGH] and I work with some ... second language s- students who are se- -- of second language --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- or else they have some so- sort of disabilities [SIGH] and [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- we help them, um, learn how to read.
L:  [NOISE]  Okay.
R:  [SIGH]  And so books are a real big part of a my world --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but so, you know, and languages.  [SIGH]  But, as I said, I got to the point where I felt like, "Well, you know, this -- [SIGH] I could do a better job with this talk [LAUGH] -- or you know, --"
L:  Mm.
R:  -- [SIGH] what -- you know, why can't I look at life and come up with my own scenarios?  [SIGH]  So, I just got -- you know, I don't know I just reached the point where ah -- ah, the books were becoming predictable or, you know, just not --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- satisfaction.  Do you read very much?
L:  [NOISE]  Um, I used to.  And I think it's pretty much the same thing.  Um, like [SIGH] I used to read a -- romance novels and different type of [SIGH] -- novels like that and it's not as typical or especially the romances -- i- it's just typical, you know what's going to happen or [SIGH] the content involved in the books, you know, um.  [SIGH]  I -- I found myself reading a lot of self-help books nowadays and, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] I don't know, um, that's -- [SIGH] that's my thing and even those books kind of get [LAUGH] t- t- typical because --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] um, [COUGH] you -- you read different books and you know t- they talk about, you know, the -- the -- the -- how to be truly happy.  And, [SIGH] you know, they talk about [COUGH] loving yourself first.  [COUGH]  Excuse me, um, having a high self esteem and you have to be happy before you can make anyone else happy type thing.  [SIGH]  So, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's kind of -- like once you read one type of self -- self help books you read them all.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH]  Um, like -- you know, take for +instance, a- a- ah, -- take -- take for instance, um, Dr Phil, like his books, and -- [SIGH] um, if the life culture show interest in, um, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know, all these life cultures and, you know, these people, psychologists, you know, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it -- it -- it's pretty much -- it boils down to the same thing.  It's not like you -- I've read one book and it -- it opened up my eyes and says something completely different than --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- other books have said.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, they -- they kind of get typical too so ... it's ... I don't know it -- it's kind of crazy.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Well, you know what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --I've been doing and, you know, it's [NOISE] -- it can get expensive or -- if you know go to the library but, also not -- you know, I -- I'll ta- -- I'll take a look at a book [SIGH] and I won't read the whole thing [SIGH] but I'll find a particular -- one page in it that's okay.  I won't read it from cover to cover [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I'll take one or two pages [SIGH] and think about that one or two page -- and then go off on a tangent with my own writing with it.  That's pretty much what I've been doing, you know.  [SIGH]
L:  That's interesting.
R:  So, you know, in fact I -- you know, what right now I've got this prose of this P- Portuguese guy and [SIGH] I wouldn't read it from cover to cover.  [SIGH]  But it's the same thing --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- if you even want to get back, like -- or I don't know how ... serious they are about us staying on [LAUGH] the topic.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I mean, you know, I could probably be happy watching a small part of that television show and -- and just kind of -- I don't need to see it from the ... beginning to the end.  It just --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] doesn't fix me -- doesn't hold me anymore.  TV [SIGH] just doesn't -- g -- I -- I -- you know, I don't stay glued to it the way I -- I -- I'm impatient and I don't have the same kind of [SIGH] a- attention s- span for --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- TV that I once did.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH]  I get tired --
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  -- of it.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  And, um, [SIGH] --
L:  I find that once I get -- you know, the older that I get and more, [SIGH] -- ah, I guess I get outside ... activities and, you know, different things going on in life.  I don't -- I don't really have time to --
R:  Right.
L:  -- watch --
R:  Right.
L:  -- as much TV.  [SIGH]  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when I was little I -- l- like growing up it was, like, coming home from school that was like my babysitter, [LAUGH] you know, I watched --
R:  Right.
L:  -- like, eight hours, you know.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  So, it -- it -- it -- it's funny to see how life has -- you know, you grow up and [SIGH] things are, you know, important to you then and, you know, it's just not a- as important I guess ... to a certain extent.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, I don't known I think maybe they have the right idea with, um, [LIPSMACK] doing some of these programs that they involve the public.  U- um, I don't know I just haven't watched it in a year but I sometimes in my staff room I hear them talking --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I guess you can call in or [SIGH] make comments on a web site.  [SIGH]  I mean maybe that is -- maybe there is some value to that, I don't know.  So, you don't have to sit ideally by [SIGH] and just, you know, without th- -- you know, vegetate as we used to say, you know, just kind of vegetate --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in front of the TV set.  [SIGH]  [MN]  Um, but they're -- there's probably -- might be some merit in that.  [SIGH]  Also I think, you know, ah, you know, pe- -- some people talk about being real fans of -- of those late night black and white movies, you know, the old classics.  [MN]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Just from the historical sense [SIGH] of ge- -- you know -- you know, just listening to the language of then, you know, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- because history is more than just, um, you know, who won a war -- [LAUGH] you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in this decade, [SIGH] it involves what the people were doing then.  So, who knows, you know, some of these reality shows [SIGH] do represent s- -- you know, where we are now in our culture.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Even though they're -- you know, it's kind of [SIGH] surface s- stuff --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but it -- it might be worth something -- ah -- ah, you know, fifty years from now for people to take a look at it because then they could see what, you know, what we were thinking about ... now. [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Right.  And our thinking is different -- is different, you know, I know they say reality shows in general but I -- I guess there's different types of reality shows, I mean, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] you have, um, [NOISE] American Idol and I know a lot of people are into that -- [SIGH] ah, my gym instructor she was, like, talking about it --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I -- I --
