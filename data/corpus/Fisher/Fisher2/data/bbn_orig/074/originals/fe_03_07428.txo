R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah, my name is Gretchen[?].
R:  Hi, Gretchen.  I'm Elaine[?].
L:  Hi, [LAUGH] nice to meet you.
R:  Yes.  Well, this is going to be an interesting conversation because we don't have TV.
L:  Well, I don't get any TV channels, so we really don't [LAUGH] watch it either. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But that's alright, I'm sure I can have an opinion on why people watch reality TV but --
R:  There you go.
L:  -- I don't ever watch it.
R:  There you go. [LAUGH] So, what do you think?
L:  I don't know, I wonder if people watch it because um -- because they think that maybe that could happen to them.
R:  That's a possibility.
L:  That's the only thing that I can think, because I don't have any interest in it at all but [LAUGH] I wonder --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if that's why it's so popular.
R:  Well, that could be and -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people like to see -- I mean, from what I'm understanding with -- with, you know -- what I've heard people talk about the shows and that, um, I think we all live in a -- i- in some respect, live in a dream world --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and like the -- The Bachelor, I guess, you know, that's kind of a dream world in a sense, you know?  What's your chances of get- -- marrying a millionaire, a billionaire or whatever?
L:  Well, that's what I mean is that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe people say, you know, "Oh, well.  I could -- you know, that's just a person just like me and so the same type of thing could happen to me".
R:  Yeah.
L:  But some of them -- I mean, like Survivor, isn't that supposed to be like on an island with all these crazy things happening?
R:  That's what I understand. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- I mean, I don't -- you know, that doesn't fit into the same kind of category [LAUGH] does it?
R:  No.  But then there's people out there and that's what -- ah, they --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- enjoy adventure --
L:  Oh, that's true.
R:  -- and -- and, um, some people live and thrive on unknown adventure.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I think most of us like some kind of adventure to a- an extent, but for myself I want to know a little bit about what's going to happen next. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Where some people, I think, thrive on the unknown adventure.
L:  Now, are there some of them too where it's like -- is that the one where's like the last -- the last person that gives up or who- whoever doesn't give up at the end they win?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  A- and so don't they have a lot of like -- I mean, I think I've heard or read about people with the things like the intrigues with, you know, people don't like this person or they do like this person or ...?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I know one of the Survivor's -- at work, they were really following very, very closely and they kept saying, "Oh, I hope so and so gets voted off.  I hope so and so gets voted off" and I'm like, "What are you talking about?" and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- yeah, so that's -- that's what they were doing and it came down to how you played the game and -- I mean, I understood that there was some skill involved also, but then it was kind of how you played the game with other people.
L:  Okay.
R:  So.  Yeah.
L:  So, is that like a -- like a voyeuristic type of thing, that people like to watch those type of things?  I don't know, it's very foreign to me.  It's a very [LAUGH] hard thing for me to understand because it doesn't --
R:  Well, yeah because -- I mean, I guess I don't -- like I say, you know, without having a TV and that -- I mean, I've -- I've seen that different things that -- on -- on the TV, you know, at different times --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I guess if I was going to watch something I'd want to watch, number one the news --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then to sit around -- to me, it's a waste of time to sit around and watch it.  So, if you're sitting there and dreaming that this could happen to you, I'm wondering if it's -- I don't know, you know, sometimes we -- not only do we dream about it wanting to happen, but it's like we don't have the gumption to get up and go do it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so.
L:  So, live kind of vicariously through these other things?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I see myself in Sue or George or Tom and whatever and, you know, I'm going to live this and this is what I would do or this is what I would say and yet, at the same time, I'm sure that what they're seeing on TV is just a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- portion of what actually takes place --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- so.
L:  Probably the most sensational parts I would imagine.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Make sure that that all gets put out there --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  -- for everybody. [LAUGH] Yeah.  So ...
L:  [NOISE] So, I guess that's the thing, is that people like to -- they don- -- they aren't willing to go and experience it for themselves but they -- they like to think about what -- what would happen if they were in that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I guess that the whole reality portion of it is that -- is that then they feel like, um -- that it's a normal person just like them.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess that makes sense, that --
R:  Yeah.  Well, we've got, um -- [MN] in fact, I think it was the first bachelor actually lives in this area --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- and so -- we- -- there's been a lot in the paper about it and of course from what I'm gathering, you know, I don't know what'll happen but after he chose her, I don't know if she dumped him or he dumped her but it obviously didn't work out.
L:  Yeah, I heard that too, that it was very short lived. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So, you know, then you've got that, was it worth or, you know?  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, then I guess, you know, there's the notoriety that comes after it too, you know?
R:  Oh, right.  Yeah --
L:  Some people really --
R:  -- because I mean you -- right.  Because in this area, every time you turn around you're reading something that Aaron's doing, you know, that -- and I mean I know his name because it's been the paper so much.
L:  Well, exactly.  I mean, obviously neither of us have watched it but we can talk about it long enough [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- because it's out there so long.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, that's what I think is so crazy --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but -- I mean, it's obviously so pervasive that you don't -- you don't have to watch it or you don't have to, um, [LAUGH] you know, really --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- participate in it and you still can know plenty and plenty about it.
R:  Right.  Just listen to other people talk about it.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's -- anyway ...
L:  So, I don't know, but I have read that, um -- you know, that they're coming out with even more --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and all the same types of things.  Don't they have like the bachelorette now and they have a whole bunch of other ...?
R:  Right.  Well, I'm wondering i- -- somebody was talking about -- they're having this race, where they have teams and they're racing around the world and doing things.
L:  Oh.
R:  They were talking about that at work the other day and I'm like, "Well, what are they doing?".  Well, there's different things they have to do and the first -- you know, the last team that shows up after all this stuff -- but it -- like most of it's in foreign countries --
L:  Hm. [NOISE]
R:  -- which I guess would put a real challenge to it because you know, you couldn't ask directions if you didn't know the language.  I mean, you could, but you know, would you get correct directions --
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  -- or something, I don't know.
L:  Now, see that type of show I think that I would be more interested in watching, because I -- I think what really disturbs me about the other ones is the -- is the play, is the politics and the -- you know, and the back biting and in fighting and all of that type of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  Whereas if it's a -- you know, I've got to overcome challenges, kind of like a dec- -- you know, decathlon or that type of thing but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that-- that shows more skill than -- than --
R:  Definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, more -- more physical prowess or -- or, um, ingenuity or something like that, rather than --
R:  Right.  And then you'd also be seeing part of the world. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] Right.  Which would be a little more fun.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's interesting, because it's -- and it's interesting that we both are on the same call, but neither one of us have really [LAUGH] watched them.
L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, actually maybe that's good.  Maybe there are -- maybe there are more people that don't watch these shows than -- than you get the notion that there are.
R:  Well, that could be true too.
L:  You know, maybe -- maybe more people just know about it from hearsay than -- than actually watch it.
R:  Yeah.  That would be interesting to know what their statistics are as to who -- how many actually watch the shows versus, I don't know, watching other stuff.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I know that they -- they asked me once to take part in a -- in a survey, but -- of television watching, but since I don't watch it -- it was kind of useless information to them, so.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  So, it's -- their -- their survey results are kind of skewed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to ... [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, because there's not too many people really when it comes right down to it, that don't have a TV --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in some -- some form or another, so.
L:  Exactly.  Well, my children are watching a video, you know, we watch movies occasionally but ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but we don't -- we don't get any TV stations --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so I don't know any of those things but ...
R:  Well, you know --
L:  I don't know.  Go ahead.
R:  -- and -- and -- when you -- when you see what some of them -- you know, does -- does it just foster, um, more people to dream and not really do something about it then?
L:  Yeah, I wonder --
R:  Because --
L:  -- if they -- if that's enough of a -- if that's enough of an experience then to not have to say, "I'd like to experience that for myself".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I don't know.  I think, you know, there's -- I guess there's all kinds of possibilities out there.  There's all kinds of people so I'm sure there's -- there's some that live the experience through that and then there's some that just dream about the experience and -- and some of them that, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --  in a sense that's probably -- that's probably their life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which is really sad to say.
L:  And then, you know -- and then on the other end of the scale, maybe there are just some who watch it to laugh at it, so. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  So, maybe there's that too, although that seems like a pointless waste of time too, so.
R:  Yeah.  So ...  And, you know, what -- in a -- in a sense, you know, what -- what you say is true, there's people out there that laugh at it, but in a sense, there's something sad about it because if -- if I -- from what I'm understanding, some- -- somebody has to lose in every situation.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  So, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then you've -- you've got that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as to how do you feel about -- with the losing and -- and, you know, why or whatever happens to -- to bring about that person that lost
