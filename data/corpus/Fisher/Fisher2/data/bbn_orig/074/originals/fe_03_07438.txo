L:  Hi, my name's Alison[?].
R:  Hi, Alison.  My name is Linda[?].
L:  Hi, Linda.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you doing?
L:  Good.  I think this is a fun topic for me because I personally don't like reality TV except the other night when that comic -- um, The Last Comic Standing came on, I thought, "Okay, I can deal with this one".  But personally, I don't really watch em, do you?
R:  No, I don't, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I was trying to think, "What can I say about reality shows?" --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- I think they're bogus --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I -- it just makes people seem so unreal, they -- it just portrays them as just greedy and petty and it just shows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- them doing absolutely anything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for a dollar.  It's like the country has lost all morals --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all they want to do is see who can eat the yuckiest stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or do something crazy.  And why would twenty five women --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- want to compete for one man's attention?
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, I think that's just -- you know, you hear about these survivor's, they drop em off somewhere and I was like, "I'm not --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- gonna waste my time watching somebody get dropped off in Africa or somewhere else" --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know?  That's a waste of my time.  I could be doing something more important --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, no, I don't watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- reality shows.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I -- I love these calls though, but I was just really thinking, "Now, what am I going to talk about --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- about reality shows, when I don't watch them?"  And I don't them because -- for that reason.
L:  Yeah, I -- and --
R:  You know?  I don't -- I think it's so crazy that twenty five women compete for one man or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- vice versa, twenty five men compete for one woman's attention, I just -- you know, I just don't think that you have to do that --
L:  I know and on national --
R:  -- so, that's just the reason I don't like and don't, you know, watch reality shows.
L:  [NOISE] That's -- I feel exactly the same way and it's so disgusting to see -- I mean, he's kissing all the girls on the same --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- show --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that is nasty.
R:  That is nasty.
L:  I mean, to --
R:  That is so, so nasty.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the one time I did watch one --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my girlfriend called and said, "You cannot believe what they're doing".  I think this person was eating cow testicles or --
L:  Oh, that is ... [NOISE]
R:  -- [inaudible] testicles or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something, you know?
L:  You know what, it --
R:  I was like, "That is so gross" and --
L:  Well, it makes me angry.  I was actually going to write a letter.  I think I -- they're better now but I was getting to the point where I was going to write a letter because each time they'd have the previews for Fear Factor, they would show them eating something and I was just so grossed out and I figured -- I mean, it's fine if they wanna have that on the show because I choose not to watch the show, but when you innocently watching another show and you have to, during a commercial, see that --
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- I was so mad.  And it's so inappropriate because they show the -- a lot of the commercials are on -- ah, my daughter, I have a two and a half year old and a newborn and we don't watch much regular TV, but if it is on, I don't want her to see that stuff.
R:  Exactly.  And that's the thing, if they want to watch reality shows --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I cannot stop them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but don't put the reality shows in between something that I want to watch --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and interrupt -- so -- and it -- it's really no sense in changing channels, because by the time you've finished changing channels, they're almost on every show.
L:  I know.
R:  I mean, it -- the commercials like are popping up on everything and --
L:  It is --
R:  -- you know, it's just so hard to get away from.  So, yes, if they wanna watch the reality shows I should have the choice in not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- watching them.  I think something should come up and say, "Beep, beep.  We're showing this commercial" so it will warn the people who don't want to see them --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and don't have to see them, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But all of a sudden you're watching something and it just flashes before your eyes and you're right --
L:  I know and you're -- I get so mad because I'm like, "I didn't wanna see that" and I -- I -- it's like it happens so fast that you can't even looking away because --
R:  Thank you.
L:  -- it's there and you don't even realise what they're doing until after and you're like, "That was nasty".
R:  That was nasty.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And like I keep my two five year old nephews so my nieces can work --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you know what, sometime I'll -- you know, I'll put them at the TV and I'll run upstairs for something and -- and then all of a sudden I hear them say, "Aunt Linda, come see this" and, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'm like, "I don't want them to see this" you know?
L:  Right.  And you -- it would be fine if it was like cable TV or something where --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know that there's shows that you don't want to see, but when it's public television and it's --
R:  It's public television.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And sometimes, you know, I try to watch whatever they're watching but sometimes you have to just get up and go to the bathroom, you -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there are times you can't -- well, I guess I could --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- cut it off and then it cut it back on as I come out, but I think that's -- you know, I shouldn't have to do that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I should be able to let them watch that, me run to the bathroom and come back out --
L:  Well, in our society --
R:  -- because you know -- and it's -- it's just crazy.
L:  -- we shouldn't -- I mean, why does our society like that so much and -- I mean, it just is such a shame because we're supposed to have -- you know, we're +better -- better moral character as a whole society and it's getting so --
R:  It's getting worse.
L:  -- progressively worse.
R:  And the more --
L:  And it's scary.
R:  -- the more the shows come on, I think the worse they get.
L:  Well --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- because Jerry Springer -- I remember before that --
R:  Oh, no.  That's just gross.
L:  -- came out.  Right.  And people used to watch Phil Donahue and whole- -- Oprah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all the wholesome talk shows --
R:  I know.
L:  -- because Oprah even never had anything nasty and then you get Montel and he's more risque and all the -- and then Jerry Springer and I was just -- and Sally Jesse and like, "This is not right" --
R:  No, it's not right and --
L:  -- and more and more people.
R:  -- you know, a long time ago Montel didn't have those kind of shows --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess his ratings dropped or something, but --
L:  He had to compete.  Yeah.
R:  -- but I think you should be able to still last, still get good ratings without having to have all that cursing and the nasty and the dresses --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and the everything, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- you shouldn't have to and, you know, yes, we should have a more realistic moral society that says, "Okay, I want to have some wholesome, good things.  Family --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- entertainment on the television or public television" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like you say, if it was cable, okay, I don't have to -- I don't pay for cable --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't watch cable, that's fine, but don't put it on my public television --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that, you know -- that I -- I watch.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, it doesn't matter what shows, I mean, they'll -- whatever commercials -- whoever is paying for commercials don't care what type of shows they're interrupting, they'll put it on any type of shows.
L:  Right.  And I -- I can't stand that.
R:  I don't -- no, I don't like that either.
L:  But I'm glad -- because I have noticed, at least with Fear Factor, because I -- I don't -- I have to look away if I see the -- although, maybe that's it because I finally started looking away, so I haven't seen anything nasty.  But -- um, I think it's getting better, but I was so angry with NBC because I thought, "I love" -- like, I don't watch much TV but in the evenings, like Thursday night Will And Grace and some funny things I watch --
R:  Yes, the funny shows come on.
L:  Yeah.  And I was thinking, "Why -- you know, I love this channel.  I -- basically, all I really watch is channel three and if they're gonna put this show on, I'm -- totally lost respect because" --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- but then they want the money and people are obviously watching these shows.
R:  Yeah, but it still should be -- what about the other percentage that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- don't want to watch the shows and want to have something -- but like you say, they still -- like NBC --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they don't want to have to find something else that they like because you -- you like Wil And Grace, you wanna keep watching that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- now, okay because we don't wanna get interrupted with all these [inaudible] showing, we have to change our viewing, but it shouldn't have to be.  You should have some wholesome channels --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- some wholeshome[?] -- wholesome TV shows that still should be able to watch it and like I say, maybe they could get a beep or something or -- or put them on the shows on cable.  I wish they would just put all of that on cable --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then --
L:  That would make so much more sense.
R:  Yes.  It would make a --
L:  But then they said -- like because all the shows are off for the season -- for summer, they said, ah, "There's a whole new line up of reality shows coming out" and --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and it's like reality sh- -- I did -- I watched Fame, um, and that te- -- that -- technically, they call it a reality TV, but I think that's like -- more like in the older -- when we used to have Fame as a show and that was good --
R:  Oh, I used to like Fame as a show, but because they said, "Reality show" I didn't even watch it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I mean, I did- -- I didn't even take the chance --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that it would be a real reality show.  And see, I probably missed it because it was it.
L:  But -- you're right, because I thought that too, because when they said, "Real-" and even with that comic show, I thought, "I'm not watching that" and -- and --
R:  See.
L:  -- suppose- supposedly it's supposed to get where the people who won the competition are supposed to live in a house together --
R:  No.
L:  -- and I'm probably not going to like that, but now it's comedy and it's a -- it's funny, but I'm thinking, "This -- this is a perfectly good show as it is, but they're gonna take it and then [NOISE] -- you want more noodles? -- they're gonna get into these people's lives and I don't want to know personal information --"
R:  No and I don't either.  I don't wanna see them fighting and back stabbing each other --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- nasty things and doing nasty things to each other.  I don't want to see that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- no --
L:  It's so sad.
R:  -- I do- -- I don't wanna watch that.
L:  And why do people like that?  I mean --
R:  I don't know.  I don't know, but I don't and I know other people that -- that don't, so they can't say the whole country --
L:  Right.
R:  -- is into this, because they're not.  There are so many people that do not like reality shows, that don't watch reality shows --
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  -- and feel the same way we do.  But I guess the higher percentage of people that they're really making the money from must, but I just still think that there should be a way that they could still get their ratings and not have so many reality shows and if more reality shows are coming on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's just gonna be to the point that I'm gonna have to just watch movies and --
L:  Right.  Read or ...
R:  -- or read or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, do more walking, go to the park, do something, but ...
L:  Right.
R:  And like I say, I really don't watch a lot of TV, but if certain TV shows that I like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I just -- I don't like reality shows --
L:  No.
R:  -- and when I heard the topic
