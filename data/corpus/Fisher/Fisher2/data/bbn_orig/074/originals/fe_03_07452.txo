R:  Sharlene[?].
L:  Hi, Sharlene.  Julie[?].
R:  Hi, Julie.
L:  [NOISE] How are you?
R:  Good and you?
L:  Good.  Do you like reality TV?
R:  Ah, it depends on what it is --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- some of them are a bit too far fetched for me.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I did watch [LAUGH] Survivor, the first series --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, I watched [LAUGH] -- I watched, um [LAUGH] -- I watched -- which one just ended?  Um --
L:  Yeah, I -- American Idol?
R:  American Idol. [NOISE] I watched American Idol.  I watched [NOISE] -- ah, now I'm watching American Junior.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um -- so, I watch those types of reality TV shows, not the far fetched ones of Who Wants To Marry --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- A Millionaire? or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um The Bachelor or any of those.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I can't get into those. [LAUGH]
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  What about you?
L:  Well, I -- um -- you know, I'm not one to watch it like regularly even though the American Idol, I tried to watch regularly because I enjoy music and, you know, enjoy, you know, people -- you know, talent things like that, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But like, um, the Survivor [NOISE] I think I saw it a couple of times, but it wasn't like, you know, [NOISE] a big deal to me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, like I -- even though that was like the huge, I think, thing that started off, you know --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- it kind of kicked off the whole reality --
R:  Yes, it did. [LAUGH]
L:  -- thing.  But -- um -- yeah, I'm like -- kind of like you, I really enjoy the American Idol and the -- now the junior's, you know, that is -- that is on.  Even though, I missed [NOISE] it this week.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] But -- um --
R:  I -- um, the -- the -- I guess the thing I don't like about, um, some of the ones that they're having now -- it -- it's way too far fetched for me --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know?  It's -- how can you go on a television show and talk about -- you're going to find the woman of your dreams --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- that you didn't know -- I think it's sending the wrong message --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- um, so that -- that's one of the reasons why I just cannot into that.
L:  Yes.  I -- I -- yeah and, you know, I saw -- I did watch like -- I mean, some o- -- a few of the episodes of, ah, Who Wants To Ma- Marry A Millionaire? and it was really like out of curiosity --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know, more than -- a- and you're right, it totally -- I -- [NOISE] I agree that it sends the wrong message.  I mean, because it -- the whole thing was set up on -- starting with a lie, so they're saying, "It's okay to lie" you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  And -- and that kind thing.
R:  And when you have people, um, like Monica Lewinsky that -- you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- now she's starting to --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- to play in a part in this [NOISE] because of, you know, her relationship with the President and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, what -- what does that say?
L:  Right.
R:  It seems like the -- the more p- publicity you can get around your name, whether it's negative or positive and whether it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- your fault or not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, those are the types of people that we're trying to seek o- -- or they're trying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to seek out now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  to host these shows --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I think that in itself sends a terrible message.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  Yes, I --
R:  -- I -- I -- I -- I'm almost scared to see [LAUGH] what's going to come up next.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I do hear on TV where they were talking about -- the next one was going to be [NOISE] um, a man looking for Mister Right.  So, they were going to take it to the far extreme --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- setting men up with men and women up with women and I -- I don't pass judgement, I mean, I -- I -- I -- I just don't pass judgement on peop- -- on people's preferences --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but whatever you do behind closed --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- doors is between you and the person that you're behind closed doors with.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  But if it's on national TV for our kids to view --
R:  Exactly and I [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- or -- or -- or to throw --
R:  -- [several inaudible words] so I don't --
L:  But --
R:  -- want them --
L:  Very impressionable, um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- teenagers. [NOISE] Yes.  Do you have kids yourself?
R:  Yeah, I have twin three year olds.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I do feel for [NOISE] you.  I -- well, which -- [NOISE] I mean, I'm kind of almost in the same boat, [NOISE] I have a two year old and a three year old.
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  So, um --
R:  And you know very, very well what I'm going through.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So -- of course you can't watch every episode.  I mean, [LAUGH] if you wanted --
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  Which is why I do things like this call, so that, you know, I can spend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- more time at home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and not have to, you know, ha- -- put my kids in day care as long or, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, have to work crazy shifts --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- o- on different jobs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, just to make ends meet, so.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  The more I can shelter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from reality TV --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the realities of the world --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I think that's m- -- that's gonna be a much better place for my kids --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and their futures.
L:  Yes. [NOISE]
R:  Because I'm really worried about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the state that we're going in now and the messages --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that we're sending.
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Yes. [NOISE] I think -- yeah -- but um, I think the -- the reality sho- -- like the American Idol and -- and, ah, the -- those kind of idols, I think they're -- it -- it -- you know, I've heard, um, the viewing -- the ratings for that is very high, like among teenagers --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the American Idol?  And, ah, I think that's real positive for [NOISE] em, you know?
R:  Yeah, because that's -- that's more of a talent show --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- it's not, you know, having somebody come out there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in skimpy this and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you're marrying somebody that you just met or you're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- confessing your love for someone you just met.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's more of a talent show.
L:  Right.
R:  So, I can go for that every day of the week.  The -- the junior one, although I do -- the couple of times I've seen it, they're actually going a little far fetched with that one too --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- because I think the parents are getting more wrapped up in that one than -- because th- -- the regular American Idol you could pretty much speak your own voice --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- um, you have parents that are taking that just a bit too far.  In some cases you've heard --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  say -- "Well, you know, I've always wanted to do this --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I didn't have the opportunity" so they're kind of living their --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fantasies through their kids --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that's -- you know, that -- that's sad to say --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- because you're putting all this unnecessary pressure on --
L:  [NOISE]
R: -- your kids for a fantasy that you had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- not necessarily one that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have.
L:  One -- right.  Right.
R:  So, I guess it's everybody looking for their two minutes of fame.
L:  Yeah, if they leave the -- leave the -- you know, if they're gonna do it, leave the, um, opinionated [NOISE] parents out of it and --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] kid's talent.
R:  And make them sign some kind of agreement that the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, "I'm not gonna --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm not gonna bash the show on T- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on -- on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on live TV or, you know, whatever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you just -- you're letting kids know that -- oh, you're -- they're teaching their kids that it's not right to lose --
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  -- and life is a part of winning and losing- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I think that sends a horrible message --
L:  Right.
R:  -- that if you can't win, you're supposed to go in the street and act like a complete fool --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like some of these people have been.
L:  Right.  Now, let me ask you so- -- just curious, would you consider, um -- like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, would you consider that kind of like a reality game show --
R:  No.
L:  -- or just a typical --
R:  I think --
L:  -- I mean ...
R:  Yeah, I would put that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like in the Wheel Of Fortune, Jeopardy type --
L:  Uh-huh. [NOISE]
R:  -- because -- you know, that's based on what you know.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  Um -- now, if they said -- if they had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- celebrities up there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um -- or -- or depending on what the prizes were --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, if it wasn't just money, if it was going be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a prize was gonna be, um, you know, go on vacation with J. Lo or P. Diddy, you know, something --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like that, then yeah, that would be -- that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would be too extreme for me but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I view it in the same picture as I do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Wheel Of Fortune and those --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [inaudible]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What do you think?
L:  Oh, yeah, I think [NOISE] -- I think you're right, I was just [NOISE] -- hey -- yes, I do [NOISE] think you're right about the game show, you know? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because -- I mean [NOISE] --
R:  No, I think they [several inaudible words] try and get it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to hold up those kinds of ratings, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LAUGH] or they would to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- consider themselves a reality TV show, but ...
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Did you get a chance to see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that TV show -- that reality show that, um, Monica Lewinsky was doing?
L:  [NOISE] Ah, no, I didn't.
R:  See, I saw it like the first day because I was just flipping channels --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I saw  it and [SIGH] you know, this was blindfold guys and have them confess their love to -- she was sort of like -- it was sort of like a spin off of The Bachelorette --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, and that was just -- you could just see [NOISE] the strain and some of the guys ended up leaving --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like before it was over, because they said, "You know, the pressures of it and they didn't think it was worth it and ..." I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess I just have a problem with people getting on TV and really saying, "I love this person enough to wanna marry them, but I just met them".
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And -- and we're talking about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, these -- these are people that are on TV --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- having sex --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- openly like that with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- multiple partners.  I think if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if we're talking about AIDS --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the AIDS epidemic --
L:  I -- right. [NOISE]
R:  -- what are we telling our kids?  What are w- -- what message are we sending?
L:  Yes, I think you're exactly right.  Yeah.
R:  And that's just horrible --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just to say that, you know, we have a reality TV show --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they're doing it on the camera --
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  -- and we can put all our defenses down.  I think that's horrible.
L:  Yes.  Yeah, I'm not sure [NOISE] what was the -- the one that was just on [NOISE] recently about couples and one [NOISE] couple at the end was going to marry. [NOISE] I saw that one a couple, just a couple of episodes. [NOISE] You know?  I didn't watch it every week, but I caught a couple of episodes here and there and it -- it was the same thing.  I mean, they was portraying kind -- i- -- it went a step further than, you know, Who Wants To Be -- I mean, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire? showed, you know, at least they didn't -- I mean, they didn't show em -- like they spent the night together --
R:  Right.
L:  -- y- -- ah, that kind of thing, you know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Where they couple shows -- I mean, I'm tal- -- they were, you know, sharing their room, sharing their bed and they're showing it --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know?  Exactly.  Which --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- of course, you know, they do on ...
R:  -- the hot tub scenes with multiple partners, you know, that's where I think they're going a bit too far
