L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Candice[?].
L:  Hi, Candice.  Where are you calling from?
R:  I'm calling from Arlington, Virginia.
L:  Oh.  I'm Andrea and I'm from Mitchell, Nebraska.
R:  Oh, wow.  Okay.
L:  [COUGH] Excuse me.  So, do you watch reality TV?
R:  I do.  I'm not obsessed with it, um, and if --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- I really don't even think it's that entertaining, but I watch it occasionally and the two shows that I watch, um -- or I have watched recently have been Top Model, um, [MN] and, ah, The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.
L:  Okay.  See -- and I -- let's see --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I'm an American Idol junky, I don't know why, but ...
R:  Oh, I include that too.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know why I didn't even consider that reality TV.
L:  [inaudible] -- I know.  I -- I guess -- w- well, I- I'm assuming it must be and, you know, I hate to admit it but it's like, ah, there's some weird, sick draw to reality TV.  I don't know, for some reason --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I have a friend who --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, we both [LAUGH] like Joe Millionaire --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it -- it was almost like we watched it just to see what stupid thing would happen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that week.  I mean, I've never actually gotten into The Bachelor or The Bachelorette --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, we don't get ABC very well out here so.  I live in -- in the middle of nowhere, in the country so [LAUGH] um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but um, my mom was completely addicted to Survivor and I started watching it and, I mean, if I missed an episode the world didn't end.
L:  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I was okay with that, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I don't know, I mean it -- it just seems that reality TV has just -- that's all you see anymore though.
R:  I think they're popular for a few reasons.  I think, number one, people, ah, maybe subconsciously or consciously are -- think it's cool that regular people are on TV --
L:  I agree.
R:  -- that these are not, you know, [NOISE] professional actr- -- actors and actresses, because you know, if they were, they wouldn't necessarily be, I don't know, as -- as trustworthy in a -- in the entertainment frame of mind --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess.  It's like we watch stars on television but we know they're acting --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- whereas if we watch regular people on TV we know we're seeing or we think we're seeing real emotions and real situations.  Maybe we're attracted to that.
L:  I -- I agree with that.  I think I -- I think -- I don't know, it's -- I think that reality television just gives people almost like an outlet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and -- and it is, it's just a little bit more believable to put yourself in those people's shoes versus, you know, just -- you know, say a regular movie or a series or whatever, that you would normally see.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I did hear on the radio, a couple of -- [several inaudible words] probably been about a month ago that, um, major advertisers, um, [LAUGH] have given the major networks an ultimatum and it's -- it's that they really want to see a decrease in --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the amount of reality, um, programing for the fall lineup, [MN] otherwise they pull their advertising and I'm sure that's a huge motivational factor but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, when it boils down to it -- I mean, networks are all about ratings and reality TV just -- it really seems to draw the viewers, you know?
R:  It does and it's making --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- a lot of actors really angry about it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they feel like it's stealing their livelihood and I wonder, like, could the actor become, I guess, obsolete?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  If -- if it got to the point where, you know, reality TV took over like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I mean, I don't -- I think that's far fetched, but I think -- just thinking of that little seed of an idea --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is what frustrates the actual actors and actresses so much, because here are these peop- -- regular people on TV drawing these ratings and these people have gone to school for years --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- and, you know, waited tables to do that thing, so.
L:  They've put in their time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, yeah, yeah.  I don't know, I think -- is it Fox that has the -- um, I think I've been seeing their advertisements for what is it, Paradise Hotel, where [LAUGH] they actually audition nor- -- supposedly normal people every week to actually join the cast of this new show?
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And, so [LAUGH] I -- I guess --
R:  And if you remember, one of the original reality TV shows was called Real World --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so I think the real element, you know, is what's so attractive to people, I really do.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I don't know, but the -- yeah, you know, something like this, I mean these people go through extensive background checks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- I mean, this is about -- I think that they said that the turnaround time on this is like a three day, um, turnaround time where these people audition and then they find out three days later whether they're going to be joining the cast of this show.  I mean I --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I mean, [several inaudible words] axe murderer doesn't get mixed up in that, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that's the other -- I mean --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- I mean, seriously w- we haven't seen anything -- I -- I guess any cata- -- anything catastrophic -- well, I don't know -- I don't -- Married By America?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
L:  That -- that one was just -- you know, my husband actually just watched the finale --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with me and it was just devastating because --
R:  Really?  I didn't see that one.
L:  -- nobody got married. [LAUGH] These two couples they finally make it, you know, they -- they had this big elimination process, blah, blah, blah --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then [MN] they had the option of getting married and they get up to the alter and, you know, [SIGH] I guess -- you know, you work under the assumption that it's -- you know, they're going to get married and then --
R:  Mm mm mm.
L:  -- ah, those -- well, the one -- one male --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just totally broke one girl's heart.  She was --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- completely in love with him and it was terrible.  I mean, I felt really bad for her [LAUGH] because this is on national TV, you know?  [inaudible] --
R:  I don't know why, but when I hear about reality TV shows that are that extreme, you know, bringing strangers together to get married I then wonder, "Hm, are these -- creators of these programs taking things to a new level where perhaps they're hiring real actors and actresses to act --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- like reality people?" because I -- when I see stuff like that, I'm like, "There's no way in hell --
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] I know. [LAUGH]
R:  -- I would go on TV to --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  -- to do something that ridiculous and embarrass myself in front of my family" -- think -- a stranger is going to introduce me to another stranger who I'm gonna get married to --"
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- that's just crazy.
L:  And -- well, you know, and I think that's a draw.  I mean, for me -- I mean, I -- I think I'm a pretty rational human being, but then I see something like this and it's like, "Okay, this is stupid, let's see who's actually going to go through with this.  Who's going to actually put themselves up in front of millions and millions of people to just ...".  I don't know -- it -- it's almost like you just [LAUGH] -- I don't know what type of personality it would take --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to actually be on one of these shows.  I know my mom would love to do Survivor.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She would absolutely love it and I think she's absolutely insane.
R:  There we go, perhaps it's -- it's the -- the desire we -- all of us regular folks have to be super human or something?
L:  Maybe.
R:  Especially when it comes to competitive things like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- Survivor.  Like, I know sometimes when I go to the movies and I see things like The +Matrix-- The Matrix, with women who have ripped bodies and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're really athletic and they're doing Kung Fu and stuff, you know, I leave thinking, "Gosh, I wish I could be an all around person like that" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, maybe shows like the Survivor give people that opportunity --
L:  Well, I think with --
R:  -- and --
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  Go ahead.
L:  Oh, I was going to say, with Survivor, I mean, they are everyday people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and I think that that's probably the draw for my mom.  Um -- I mean, they're really every day people who are just out there, you know, doing their thing in front of all of these vie- -- all of these viewers, you know?  And -- because I think she can kind of be -- she's an attention hog [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and I think [several inaudible words] --
R:  And a female just won, I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the last one, so.
L:  I -- they -- they did, I didn't actually watch this -- I mean, I watched like the first couple but [MN] you know, in the very beginning they were really normal people, normal looking people --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and this last season irritated me because it was like the beautiful people Survivor --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and [LAUGH] -- yeah, the girl who won was a Swimsuit Model.
R:  Ugh.
L:  So, yeah.  [LAUGH]  That's wh- --
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah, but I don't know, I --
R:  You know?  This is -- I'm not going to go off the subject, but I saw --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just as an example, I saw on the internet an article about an army colonel who duped fifty women into marrying th- -- marrying him or getting engaged to him, it was on Hotmail --
L:  Seriously?
R:  -- on, ah, MSN.  Did you see that?
L:  I did not.
R:  And that -- when I read the article, a woman said, you know, "We're not stupid women here, we're professional, intellectual, bright women" and the first thing I thought was, "Yeah, but you all don't have any common sense" so --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and it reminds me of our desire to participate in these reality based things.  It's like I -- I think we're all -- hu- -- human's are gong through an age where they're confronting what they feel and what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they think across the board and maybe back in the day, like our parents or our parents' parents wanted fantasy because life was more difficult and now that life physically is harder, people are, you know, I guess more prepared or more comf- comfortable confronting what's real --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- and we go --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- and do stuff like that.
L:  [inaudible] oh, my gosh.  That's crazy.  That is really crazy.  Well, I'm -- I [SIGH] -- I don't know if this is -- I mean -- you know, back when oh, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? came out and then
