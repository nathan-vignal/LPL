L:  [MN]  Hello!
R:  [MN]  Hello!
L:  Hi, there!
R:  [MN]  H- hi!
L:  I'm Linda.  [SIGH]
R:  I am Joanna.  [SIGH]
L:  And where are you?
R:  I am in North Carolina.
L:  Oh, I'm in Texas
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  Y- yeah!  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Where abouts in Texas?
L:  Right outside of Forth Worth.  [SIGH]
R:  O- okay.
L:  Y- yeah!
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]  Oh, right.  So, we're supposed to talk about h- holidays, huh?
R:  Yes.
L:  [MN]  Well, Christmas is my favorite.
R:  Christmas is your favorite?
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Why is that?  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I just like all of the c- colors and the t- tree and the decorating and just the [SIGH] -- everybody seems to be in a happier spirit.
R:  [SIGH]  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]  That's true.
L:  Y- yeah.  What about you?
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I -- you know, I -- I guess Christmas is -- would be -- would be up there a- as o- one of my favorites.  I [SIGH] enjoy Thanksgiving too because it gets a lot of the family together.  [SIGH]  T- the -- not always av- a- available to get together at Christmas, Thanksgiving seems to be a -- a better time [SIGH] for people to get together because p- people are scattered at Christmas time.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  So, ...
L:  Well, [MN] we've -- p- p- pretty -- we did a pretty -- we used to do a p- pretty good T- Thanksgiving, you know.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But [SIGH] since the kids are kind of grown and gone they kind of do their own thing but Christmas has just always -- [SIGH] stayed special in our family, --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  And that's -- [SIGH] that's the one time that we all [SIGH] manage to work around our schedules to, you know, kind of [SIGH] be together even though we have [SIGH] inlaws and outlaws and, [SIGH] you know, all of that t- to contend with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We always manage to -- to get together --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for Christmas whereas Thanksgiving and [SIGH] sometimes Easter we -- we just don't make it --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- you know.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, the -- one of the things was if you -- i- i- if you could make up a holiday what would you make up as a holiday?
L:  [SIGH]  I don't know.  I had --
R:  What would you celebrate?
L:  -- I hadn't really thought about it but maybe a -- maybe a family holiday where you just get together [SIGH] just because you are family.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  That'd be nice.
L:  Yeah.  You know, and that way [SIGH] you don't really have to celebrate anything and there's no decorations.  It's just for fun --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and [SIGH] fun and fellowship.
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  I think that I might ... h- have a day where everybody celebrated their pets.
L:  [MN]  Their pet?
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, that would be neat.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, 'cause [SIGH] I don't have a pet right now but I know when I did he was [SIGH] quite beloved of the family.  And so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you -- you -- we could just kind of have it.
R:  And they don't really -- they don't really get to celebrate anything unless --
L:  No, they really don't, do they?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  O- oh, that is -- that is true and it seems like, [SIGH] you know, thanks -- I guess thanks to Hallmark, you know, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- th- there's al- already a Grandmother or a Grandparents' Day.  And --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] t- this day and that day and Nurses' Day and Teachers' Day.  And, [SIGH] you know, every kind of other day that you could ... a- already imagine --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know.  So, [LIPSMACK] I think maybe a Pet Day or just a Family Day m- might be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] might be the ticket.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Ah, how big is Halloween ... in North Carolina?
R:  Oh, you know, some of my friends are -- are just e- enthralled with it.  I mean [SIGH] everything is decorated up [SIGH] ... beyond measure.  It -- it's very big in Chapel Hill because Chapel Hill has a big H- [SIGH] Halloween.  I don't know whether they have a parade or ... it's just a big -- big party day.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  But, um, [MN] it --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it -- it can be pretty big.
L:  Yeah, well you know i- it used to be big [SIGH] down here several years ago.  And then they -- the schools kind of [SIGH] put a quietus to it because of [SIGH] a- all of t- the religious symbolism and the witches and, --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- y- you know, and all of that and people kind of shied away from it.  And then, of course, there were all the tale- -- the horror tales and the [SIGH] -- the razor blades in the apples and stuff.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  But it seems like in the last five years [SIGH] it c- certainly has made a big come back.
R:  Well, I -- you know, I -- I don't t- think -- I -- I don't think that I've had kids [SIGH] -- actually, I've been away the last two [SIGH] Halloweens in -- out of the country [SIGH] but I -- I was going to say I ... I know that I have f- friends who are a- adults who go wild.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I mean [SIGH] decorate up their house and have b- big Halloween parties and [SIGH] rather substantial, you know, investment in -- in decorations --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and costumes and everything.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  Now, [SIGH] see that's the same down here and it just seemed [SIGH] to gain momentum again in the last, you know, four or five years.  And [SIGH] instead of the t- trick or treating, you know -- I mean kids still do trick or treat but it seems like [SIGH] more and more people are [COUGH] doing parties and that type, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know, theme parties, [SIGH] that type of thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And [SIGH] having the kids, you know, attend those rather than having them out on the street and, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, kind of left up to their own devices.
R:  Yep.
L:  [SIGH]  So, you know, I was wondering if that was [SIGH] typical, you know, everywhere or ... just [SIGH] -- just down here?
R:  It -- it -- it -- I -- I -- I don't know.  I -- I think that [SIGH] they're [SIGH] -- th- there's so much of a rush to -- to get on with Christmas [SIGH] after Labor Day hits --
L:  [NOISE]  I know.
R:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  It's --
L:  I know the stores start decorating.
R:  Yeah, and it's just -- just overwhelming.  And it used to be, [SIGH] you know, after Halloween they'd do --
L:  [MN]  Oh, I remember --
R:  -- that.
L:  -- way back when, [SIGH] when they really didn't put it out until [SIGH] after --
R:  [NOISE]  Thanksgiving.  [LAUGH]
L:  Thanksgiving.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Then you were blitzed with it, you know.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I mean, you're right, after Labor Day, you know, [SIGH] the Halloween and the Christmas kind of go up at the same time.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  You know, which -- [SIGH] I think takes a lot away from Christmas, you know, as far as the --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] anticipation.  You know, people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get kin- kind of tired of [SIGH] -- of seeing it, you know, this that and the other.  But [SIGH] I think, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, [COUGH] because of the economy, [SIGH] you know, I think the retailers say, "If we don't get this stuff out there, make people start thinking about it" [SIGH] you know, then their sales will be down.
R:  [MN]  Y- yeah, and a- actually that's a real big concern.  [SIGH]  But [SIGH] I was going to say that it seems that in terms of retail, at least, here ... Halloween really has ... become, you know, m- more than just a small kids' day.  I -- I don't remember -- you know, t- there's a lot of ... there's a lot of activity at the retail level, --
L:  Uh-hum.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- ah, about that, --
L:  Right.  Much more so --
R:  -- and parties and stuff.
L:  -- than when I was young, you know.
R:  Yes, and the -- and the --
L:  And we had our ... ghosts and our goblins, you know, and this and the that --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- but I mean as far as, you know, [SIGH] decorations for the home and stuff it's just [SIGH] -- you know, it's almost as big as Christmas, really.
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  But, ah, n- now what about St Patrick's Day?
L:  [MN]  N- no.  We don't --
R:  No.  [SIGH]
L:  -- we see -- you know, it may be a little bit more than it used to be.  [MN]  But down here in Texas there's not a big push for St Patrick's.  Now, I lived in Boston f- for a while [SIGH] and, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my gosh, there were parades and everything turned green and this that and the other.  And we were just shocked.  [SIGH]  You know, we thought, "My gosh --"
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  "-- look at these people go crazy for [LAUGH] St Patrick's Day", you know.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But down here in Texas, it's not a biggie.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Well, it seems to be pocketed.  The -- I understand it's [SIGH] -- Charleston, South Carolina, does a -- a really big th- -- St Patrick's Day.  [SIGH]  And I guess N- New Orleans does [SIGH] a fairly large St Patrick's Day.
L:  Hm.
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I think I -- I th- I've been in Venice during Carnival which is [SIGH] Mardi Gras.  [SIGH]  And -- and that was extremely exotic and interesting.
L:  Mm.
R:  It was like [SIGH] being -- did you ever see the movie Amadeus?
L:  [NOISE]  Long time ago.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- but I mean it was like walking on to the set of the movie.  It was [SIGH] very -- very corn- -- kind of steeped in this, [SIGH] you know, seventeenth, eighteenth century, [SIGH] sort of, t- tradition and [SIGH] -- and -- and it was -- it was very interesting because the costuming was -- was -- was capes and masks and not [SIGH] -- not some of the costuming [LAUGH] that you get at Halloween.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  So, it -- it was -- it was a lot of fun.  [SIGH]  I -- I'm not sure that I'd be up to the amount of d- drinking that goes on in New Orleans --
L:  N- no.  And that's the truth.
R:  -- for Mardi Gras.
L:  Really?
R:  But it seems that [SIGH] you know, it -- it would be interesting to [SIGH] get involved.  I have somebody who works for me who [SIGH] goes to t- the Mardi Gras [SIGH] but she goes to a different part of Louisiana for it.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  And it -- and it's not quite so raucous as --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [SIGH] New Orleans and New Orleans repu- -- New Orleans reputation.  So, ...
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  What about Fourth of July up there?
R:  [SIGH]  Well, of course, with -- given all the [SIGH] -- all the activity currently and, [SIGH] um, the fact that Fort Bragg and C- Camp Lejeune are in [SIGH] North Carolina there's -- there's an awful lot of [SIGH] -- of -- resurgence of +patriotic [SIGH] observance of -- of Fourth -- y- you know, of the Fourth of July.
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  [SIGH]  And see we have the same thing down here with, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, with Carswell and Fort Hood and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, all of that.  So, [SIGH] I --
R:  And you -- well y- -- let's see.  Well, Fort Hood's in -- in San Antonio or ...?
L:  Right.  I think it's in San Antonio.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  But, you know, I mean we just [MN] -- b- being in various different places when -- [SIGH] whenever the holiday h- happens to strike --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  I think about two years ago I was out in, ah, Colorado [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they did a big bang up, ah, [MN] -- and it was fairly quiet, y- you know, during that year.  Nothing was going on, [SIGH] you know, that really would've caused a resurgence and stuff.  But they did a great big huge, ah, [LIPSMACK] fireworks display --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- out there.  And, of course, you know we have 'em here in -- in Fort Worth, Dallas area, [SIGH] you know, also.  [MN]  And, ah, [SIGH] ... I don't know how -- how big it would be this year 'cause I've heard that a lot of the fireworks are s- shipped by train.  Have you heard that?  And th- -- they're afraid that the terrorists might ... find --
R:  Oh, I -- I didn't --
L:  -- those trains.
R:  -- hear that.  I -- I --
L:  Yeah.  And I though --
R:  -- oh, well I lived in New York City area for a while and [SIGH] the fireworks are always -- a- a- ah, t- they r- run them on -- they r- run them back and forth between the East River and the Hudson River, [SIGH] and -- and are quite +spectacular -- spectacular and [SIGH] there's always a lot that goes on.  [SIGH]  You know, my folks live up in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania [SIGH] and -- and there -- there's some nice fireworks displays, a little l- low -- low key but [SIGH] the ... Battle of Gettysburg took place on the first, second and third of ... [SIGH] July.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
R:  So, there's always a lot of activity up there --
L:  Right.
R:  -- during the Fourth of July.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But, um, there was a very nice Memorial Day observance [SIGH] which y- you -- you know, [LAUGH] Memorial Day is kind of, ah, [SIGH] you know, M- Memorial Day and Veterans' Day and kind of --
