L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  H- h- hi!
L:  [SIGH]  Hi!  [NOISE]
R:  I'm Selma.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I'm Selma from Pittsburgh.  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Trudy from Atlanta.  [NOISE]
R:  O- o- oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from the south.  [SIGH]  Well, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we're supposed to talk about reality TV --
L:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I don't particularly think it's v- [LAUGH] very good.  How -- what do you think about it?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, [LIPSMACK] I don't think they're good either and I -- I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- don't r- really watch too many of them [SIGH] and, um, [NOISE] -- I mean some of them, yes, [NOISE] but, um, [SIGH] --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I don't think they're a very, um, [SIGH] -- um, what should I say, entertaining form of, ah, TV or [SIGH] -- or educational, ah, in anyway or even beneficial in anyway.  [SIGH]  Ah, so I don't think, um, it's really a good idea.  What --
R:  Well, --
L:  -- about you?
R:  -- I happen to agree with you a hundred percent.  I w- w- watched -- one night I watched --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- this program about men -- ah, men who, [SIGH] um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- became engaged to women that they hadn't even met yet.  [SIGH]  I --
L:  Y- yeah, I know, --
R:  -- mean it was so ridiculous.
L:  -- I saw that too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my God, it was so ridiculous!
L:  I know and then I saw the ad for another one, [SIGH] [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- excuse me, ah, which had, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ah, these guys in masks and, ah, t- the woman was supposed to have picked [SIGH] one of those, ah, you know, not [NOISE] knowing how [NOISE] they looked [NOISE] just by how they interact --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- or not and I was like, "Oh, my God, [NOISE] how can somebody do that?"
R:  I know.
L:  And that too in front of the whole [NOISE] country?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I know.  I mean, it -- it -- it's [SIGH] this program I -- I -- I mean I couldn't b- believe it.  [SIGH] I -- I mean these --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very -- the -- the man was very handsome.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  The men, I should say, and the women were b- beautiful.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  And the -- the women were the is th- -- did you watch the one where they couldn't even see the woman?  The woman was, like, behind --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a s- screen [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yes --
R:  -- and then the --
L:  -- yes, I did.  [NOISE]  I did.
R:  O- oh, --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I mean it's [SIGH] -- it's crazy.
L:  I think it's --
R:  It's really crazy.
L:  -- ridiculous.  I don't know how --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- they -- all these dating things [SIGH] and all these dating games, I don't know where they're going.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Why do you think that -- we're suppose to f- -- ah, discuss why you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- think they're so popular.  [SIGH]  I can't even ima- [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I guess, ah, it's popular be- -- um, ah, mostly because of this, [SIGH] ah, audience that they're, t- ah, trying to target, m- mostly young folks and, you know, [SIGH] um, they -- they find it entertaining [SIGH] because they can see, [SIGH] ah, good looking girls and guys and [SIGH] -- and, you know, what happens, [NOISE] um, between them and [MN] it's kind of like, [SIGH] --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- you know, it m- maybe t- they might not be [NOISE] --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- a situation like that and they might be, [SIGH] ah, trying to get enjoyment out of, ah, bad, ah, thing and I guess that's why it -- that's why they're popular.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  I guess.  Ah, it's kind of like they're putting themselves in their place and [SIGH] put- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and t- thinking that, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] not thinking but wishing that they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had the handsome man or the handsome [SIGH] -- or the beautiful women, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  -- you know, that kind of thing.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
R:  And then they were offering them a lot of money too so that was another thing [NOISE] that, ah, --
L:  Y- yeah, exactly.
R:  -- like, a million dollars or some crazy, -- ah, some tremendous amount of money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know --
L:  Ye- [NOISE] --
R:  -- if it was a million.
L:  -- y- yeah, it -- it is [NOISE] a million dollars mostly, ah, I mean, ah, the show that w- was [SIGH] Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire [NOISE] [SIGH] was, um, that the person -- that the guy chooses [SIGH] would get, um, [MN] -- I mean both of them would get a million dollars.  And then if they don't, ah, live together then they're -- they're -- they can split the money up.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, God.
L:  So, ah, you know, it's big money and, ah, [SIGH] I guess people are interested.  You know, every day folks like, ah, [SIGH] you know, people who aren't so rich, ah, maybe they like to see, "Oh, who gets to get the million?" you know, and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- maybe that's the w- -- ah, that's the reason why they see this.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, but, yeah, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's ridiculous --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but anyway.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know what else to say about them but, um, [SIGH] I -- I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't w- watch very much television but I like to watch th- -- a few things like the Jeopardy.  I like Jeopardy.  Do you watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Jeopardy?
L:  U- um, no, I watch Dr Phil.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  Do you watch that?
R:  Oh, I saw him just once or twice 'cause I use- -- he's on in the afternoons, isn't he?
L:  Yeah, yeah, ah, over here it's, ah, five in the evening.
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  I think in Pittsburgh it's, like, in the afternoon and I don't generally watch, ah, TV in the afternoon but I did see him once or twice and, [SIGH] a- ah, I thought he gave pretty good advice.  I thought he was --
L:  Oh, yeah, very good advice --
R:  -- really good.
L:  -- and [SIGH] -- and he's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- getting so popular.  I think he's going to beat Oprah.  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  You know what I'll -- I -- ah, you know, after -- I think after several we- -- years --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people get tired of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I shouldn't say that because the night programs Johnny Carson --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was on for years and years and years but, generally, [SIGH] I think that after several years people get just ... tired of watching the same person all the time and --
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  -- I -- I think you might be right.
L:  [NOISE]  And -- and --
R:  But I --
L:  -- especially when it's every day.  If it's, like, once or twice a week then, [SIGH] ah, you know, people w- won't get so easily bored but if it's --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- every day I think it's -- it is very -- very boring.   [NOISE]
R:  That's like -- ah -- ah -- Law and Order which, I think is on eighteen times a day or some ridic- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] a- a- a- a- -- it's on so much.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And my husband watches it every day and I think, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- "How can you watch that program --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- every single d- [LAUGH] day?"  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, my husband can watch news twenty four seven.  S- so, ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  I guess, you know ... [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]  [COUGH]
L:  Hey, they're different kinds of, you know, e- especially men I think they can ... a- ah, you know, watch this kind of stuff forever.  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH]  That's true.  My husband watches -- ah, when he's not watching Law and Order he watches CNN too a lot.
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And then they repeat the same thing, like, every hour so I mean it's -- it's ridiculous to have it on for --
L:  I know!  [NOISE]
R:  -- but --
L:  -- I know.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, so and I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think that, um -- um, I -- I've read a -- oh, what's her name, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I can't think of her name, she's a really good author.  She's written about herself and she doesn't have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- allow any --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- TV in the house.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And sometimes I think she's very s- smart.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Especially with kids, I don't think they should watch any T- -- ah, very little TV.
L:  But --
R:  U- um.
L:  -- wh- what show are you talking about?
R:  I can't thin- -- I'm talking about this author.  I can't think of her name but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I -- she wrote a -- a book about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- herself and she said that she doesn't allow any TV --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the house.  She has young children --
L:  [NOISE]  Wow!
R:  -- and I think she's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] I think she's kind of smart, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know my grandchildren --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if they start looking at cartoons, they get so enamored by it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that [SIGH] --
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  -- you have to drag them away.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, exactly.
R:  And, um --
L:  [SIGH]  And they tend to get so influenced by what they're seeing they -- [SIGH] they try to imitate those [NOISE] -- the- -- those characters [NOISE] [SIGH] in their l- lives and [SIGH] [NOISE] maybe it doesn't blend in but they don't know it.  They're too young to know that.  And, you know -- so --
R:  Right.  Y- yeah.
L:  -- I think it's a very good idea to [NOISE] keep kids off of TV and [SIGH] [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- e- especially --
R:  -- that's true.
L:  -- ah, the reality TV [SIGH] I mean the kind of stuff [NOISE] that these reality [NOISE] shows are getting into nowadays.  I mean they're, [SIGH] ah -- they're, like, too much for kids to watch.  And then I think, [SIGH] ah, kids should be kept away from all the reality shows, [SIGH] u- um, that are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- airing now and -- [SIGH] and the ones that they are thinking of airing in the future.  Because I see some ads for, [SIGH] um, more reality shows, [NOISE] um, in all the m- major network channels.  And I'm like, "Oh, my God [SIGH] t- the -- the extent they'll go just to get the audience" you know?  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh, I -- they're terrible.  And then there's one show I think --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- where they -- just they say all live in one house --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or something and, oh, sad.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.
R:  And -- and they show them d- doing everything --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, they have no privacy.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [SIGH]  Do you have a child?  I -- I hear a li- -- yeah, I hear a little --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I hear a little c- child --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- in the background.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, y- [LAUGH] yeah, he's my son.  He's two.  [LAUGH]
R:  O- o- o- oh!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  O- o- o- oh!
L:  [LAUGH]  He's --
R:  Well, --
L:  -- he's -- he's now in the terrible twos so sometimes he gives me a real hard time.  [LAUGH]
R:  O- o- o- oh!
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Does he watch TV?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Do you let him watch any TV?
L:  Ah, yeah, I let him watch, like, the kids shows, like, Barney [NOISE] and Telly Tubbies and --
R:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, my grand daughter --
L:  -- and Elmo.  [SIGH]  Elmo's World.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Sesame Street.  [SIGH]  That's all.  I mean I don't let him [SIGH] -- and then sometimes he -- he'll watch with us, ah, [SIGH] some of the other shows.  [NOISE]  But then because, ah, as of now, he's just two and he doesn't really talk or understand much so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] I just let him but, um, [NOISE] -- but I -- I mean [NOISE] as soon as he starts understanding I -- I -- I don't want him to watch any of these shows and [NOISE] [SIGH] I want, ah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- him to be kept away from all these shows.  [NOISE]
R:  Sometimes those two year olds know -- understand more than what you think they understand too.
L:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah.  I know.
R:  You know, they're --
L:  I think about that too and I'm like, [SIGH] [NOISE] I sometimes wonder how much he's understanding and then, you know, [SIGH] ah, he does [NOISE] -- he does understand quite a bit more than what I think he does.  [NOISE]
R:  I th- -- yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  So, what's he saying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- does he -- did -- did you say he's not talking or is he talking now, or, um --
L:  Ah, like he doesn't, ah, [NOISE] the problem is he's exposed to [NOISE] multiple languages [SIGH] so he's not, like, [NOISE] ah, -- he's -- he's not focused on say just one language.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  So, he's -- he's kind of confused [SIGH] [NOISE] and, ah --
