L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Rob.  Who am I speaking with?
R:  Hi, this is Rita.
L:  Hi, Rita.  How ya doing?
R:  I'm fine.  I'm from Virginia.
L:  Oh, Virgin- um -- I'm from, uh, New York actually.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, uh, how -- how ya doing today?
R:  Oh, I'm doing fine.  And yourself?
L:  I'm doing pretty well.  I'm kind of a little quiet and bored here at work.  So, this came at a perfect moment.
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so, I guess the subject was the reality T.V. thing.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I couldn't really hear it that well but, uh, was it a particular one --
L:  No, I think ...
R:  -- that we're supposed to discuss?
L:  No.  They said, uh, just, uh, why do we think that it's become popular and do we watch them?
R:  Oh.
L:  The things like Survivor and Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire and things like that.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, so, what do you think?  Do you watch that stuff?
R:  I watch it only if I have nothing else to do to be quite honest.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  If I'm doing something around the house and I just happen to turn the T.V. on, but to really program myself that I've got to be there at a certain hour to see something no, I do not.
L:  Yep.  Are there any of them that you particularly have enjoyed watching?
R:  Mm.  No.  I think it's more out of curiosity.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  More than anything.  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, I guess there's some have, uh, caught -- certainly caught my attention.  I'm not necessarily meaning to, but suddenly, you know, watching, uh, Survivor and getting caught up in it and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then wanting to see the next one and all that.  But, um, I don't know that there's any that I particularly go out of my way all that much to watch, though sometimes I do a little work then have something -- some big things to do with that and I watch it for that purpose.
R:  Yeah.  I think I may have watched Survivor a little in the beginning because we did have that individual from Virginia --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- um, and I was curious to see if he was gonna make it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and -- but other than that, um, I think Survivor started out as being something that everybody's -- caught their attention, but now they've gotten kinda a lot of -- you know, it's overboard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I don't know.  I'm just not that interested in it.
L:  You think there's any kind of stories of things like that that you would like if it didn't go overboard like, you know, if somebody -- I don't know -- where it doesn't have so much to do with like the whole fantasy thing where it's more like real life, like if it was a documentary or something like that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you like -- do you ever watch documentary films and stuff like that?
R:  Yeah, maybe so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Maybe so.  But I wonder how much they really, really are aware of what's gonna happen at the end, if they are really -- like this last guy on the, um -- marry me or -- or -- for a million dollars, or you choose me or you choose the million, is that how it's working?
L:  You know, I -- I -- I don't even -- I haven't watched that one.  So, I'm not quite sure how ...
R:  I haven't watched it, um, I've seen commercials on it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I just really wonder, you know, if the guy knows --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- anything.
L:  Right.  He's supposed to not know anything about --
R:  Right.  He doesn't realize --
L:  -- them having a choice?
R:  -- that -- that they -- if he falls in love with her and she does with him that she will make -- have to make a choice.
L:  I see.
R:  It's the way I understand it that she will either choose him or the million.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, I just really wonder if he knows anything like that.  I know it's already been taped and it's over and done with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he's, you know, talking some about it now on the talk shows --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, you know, I just really wonder how much you go into -- to something like that blindfolded and don't know really any of the outcome.
L:  Right.  Yeah.  That is -- that is true.  I don't know.  I mean, I suppose -- I mean, I -- you never know what's gonna be the outcome as far as she's gonna win or something like that I guess, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Or do ya think that that's even rigged?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Do you think you would try out for something like that?
L:  It would depend on what it is.  Like, uh, there's something appealing about the idea of trying out for like a Survivor or like going somewhere exotic and, um, you know, just kinda being immersed in that experience.  There's -- there's something appealing.  I mean, I don't think I'd wanna do something like Big Brother where I'm just locked in a house or something like that.
R:  [LAUGH] That's true.
L:  Um ...
R:  Oh, that's a little horrid.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  But I don't know.  Do you think you would ever audition for something like that?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  No.  Mhm.
L:  Even if you like -- like it doesn't matter what you would win, like if you could win a whole -- I don't know -- like a new house or something like that?
R:  No.  I wouldn't even attempt to try.  No.
L:  No?
R:  No.  No.
L:  What do you think would ...?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Is there anything you could think of that would make you do something like that?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  I'm just not that type of person that would put myself up there [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Right.
R:  -- to be almost I feel like defeated before I started.  No.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  No.
L:  I saw this, um -- this film last night, which was a documentary that I thought was one of the best things I've ever seen.  It's called Spellbound about, um [LIPSMACK] -- about a -- this spelling bee, the national spelling bee --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was, you know, kind of I guess it's in the same family of things 'cause it's reality, but it's a documentary, a much more of a pure thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was just so -- so compelling.  It's so wonderful, you know, it made me -- I just -- I just loved it.  I'm -- I'm not quite sure what the point is, but it somehow felt related to, uh, what we were talking about, but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I recommend that if you get a chance.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, I don't know.  I don't watch a lot of television.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, no?
R:  But, um, if I have the time and, you know, if something's really on that I think -- you know, it's like you say, the documentaries are pretty good --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and if there's something, you know, that I'm really interested in, you know, I will make time to see it.  But I just don't have that much time at night for watching television.
L:  Yeah.  Do you have a family?
R:  Yes.
L:  Mhm.  So, you got a lotta taking care of folks and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing stuff and keeping everybody up to date?
R:  Well, I feel like if I'm sitting down watching T.V. there's something else that I should be doing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, mostly weekends or, you know, something like that I might sit down and watch something or -- or else tape it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if there's something I wanna look at later on.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  Does the rest of your family watch a lotta T.V.?
R:  No.
L:  No?
R:  No.  We're just not T.V. people.
L:  Yeah.  Well, good for you.
R:  No.
L:  There's a lot of other better things to be doing than watching T.V.
R:  Well, that's the way I look at it that if I'm doing that then, you know, there's something else I could be doing probably a -- a little bit better.
L:  And you're more like -- I mean, doing this outside and ...?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  But, uh, I think they have gone overboard with these reality T.V. -- I can't imagine what they're coming up with next.
L:  Mm.
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah.  I'm sure there's some other crazy stuff out there.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It wasn't too long ago -- I mean, even locally -- I don't know about you -- but locally the radio stations are even getting into it now and ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  With the, um -- the Bachelor and now they've got the girls, you know, to try to find someone to marry and, you know, it's just almost -- you're being +inundated with all of this all of a sudden because I guess maybe -- I don't know.
L:  Obviously some people are watching and enjoying it and ...
R:  Some people love it.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH] Uh, I'm trying to figure out why.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I guess it's not -- it's the unknown that people just don't know what's gonna happen and they're just drawn to it.
L:  Yeah.  I think it also has a little bit of the, uh -- you know, when you're driving by a highway and you see an accident you can't help but look type of thing.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.  But I wouldn't even try out for anything locally.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  No.
L:  You wouldn't wanna be set up on cheap --
R:  No.
L:  -- national T.V. for a date?  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  [LAUGH]  I can't imagine what type of person does that.  I mean, this last guy I've -- I -- I did see him on a talk show one morning --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he was talking about how he was a successful lawyer back in Texas.  I think it was Texas where he was from.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I'm still trying to figure out, you know, why --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- he went out for that.
L:  Yeah, I can't imagine.
R:  But uh, to each his own I guess.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Whatever, you know, makes you happy and, you know, the thrill.
L:  Right.  I guess so.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  And everybody needs their fifteen minutes.
R:  Yeah.  But he had all his partners looking out for all of his cases and ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  I don't know if I'd wanna be his client, you know?
R:  No.  I don't think so either.
L:  Yeah.  So, have you done this phone thing before?
R:  This is my second call.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  How 'bout you?
L:  Yeah, this -- this is now my third.  I think that's all you get.
R:  Did you -- how did you find out about it?
L:  Something on the Internet.  I don't remember exactly where I saw it, but there was something on the Internet on some -- some site that I kinda check out occasionally.
R:  It doesn't have to do with coupons does it?
L:  No.  No.  This one was more kind of -- a thing called Craig's List I think that's where I saw it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That has just a lotta classified stuff, some fun stuff --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and some interesting.  So, um, yeah, I haven't received a check yet though.
R:  Well, um, it's my understanding -- and maybe I'm wrong, I should go back and read it I guess -- that maybe you had to do your three calls and then you'll be --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- uh, send a check after that and I think you can get up to five.
L:  Oh, well, this is my third.  So, I'll see what happens.
R:  And you can also initiate it yourself.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  You just go back and dial that number they sent you and -- and, uh, type in your pin number --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, you can make your own call whenever it's convenient for you.
L:  Right.  That's odd.  What is exactly the point?  I'm not quite ...
R:  I'm not really sure.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, a friend sent it to me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She said, you know, she got fifty dollars just for talking to people and I thought well, you know, that sounds interesting --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I am a stay at home Mom.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um, it --
