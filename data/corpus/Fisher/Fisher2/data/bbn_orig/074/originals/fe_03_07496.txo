L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi, my name is Prankul.
L:  Hi, my name is David.
R:  Hi, David.
L:  Hi.  What was your name?
R:  Uh, it's Prankul, spelt P.R.A.N.K.U.L., Prankul.
L:  Prankul?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, uh, do you have a favorite holiday?
R:  Uh, I don't know, like it's -- how about -- how about you?  Why don't you start?
L:  [LAUGH] Uh, well, I don't really have a favorite holiday.  Uh, [MN] you know, they're sort of inconvenient, really. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I, sort of, like Halloween.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's good.  Uh, but most holidays seem sort of, uh, contrived
R:  Okay.  Well, I mean, for me, like I would say like all holidays are good 'cause you get your time -- to spend time with friends and family and, you know, just, uh -- just celebrate together and, uh, like eat together, go somewhere together, stuff like that, uh --
L:  Oh, these are all good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Definitely. [SIGH] You see, I -- I live -- where I live, I'm not -- I'm not always with my family.
R:  Okay.
L:  So a lot of times holidays --
R:  You work -- work away from home?
L:  Uh, yeah.  Well, my family's just spread out all over the place.
R:  Okay.
L:  Everybody lives in different places.
R:  Okay.
L:  So it's usually not even holidays when we're together. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh -- so what do you do, for example, like for Christmas you would go home?
L:  [MN]
R:  Is it -- is it like that or ...?
L:  Um, sometimes but the thing is, is like home isn't even home anymore --
R:  Okay.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] -- because like my parents don't live where I grew up --
R:  Oh, okay, that's true.
L:  -- but we might -- you know, we might get together at my sister's house --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, several of us --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but, you know, at Christmas but, uh -- or Thanksgiving.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] How about you?
R:  Oh, I mean, I'm, uh -- yeah, I mean, I -- it does -- I can't even really identify because, like, my -- I'm -- I'm from India and so me and wife are here but -- and her -- but my -- my parents and my brother is back in India so, you know, like I -- I get to see them maybe like once every year and a half.
L:  So, you -- but -- but you guys really have -- are you Hindi?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So you guys have a lot of holidays and you -- and you have good ones.
R:  Yeah, that's true, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true, although --
L:  Because I --
R:  Although not here. [LAUGH]
L:  Not here so much --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, but, you know, I -- I -- I've been to a couple of -- of good parties that were Indian festivals.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  Where -- where do you live?
L:  Well, I live in Los Angeles --
R:  Oh, that's a great place to live.
L:  But like one -- [MN] and so here there's some but the one I was at that was really fun was in England --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- but, uh -- but there was really good food and there was a really good time.  It was -- I think it was more [LAUGH] fun holiday than American holidays.
R:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, that's true.
L:  So, where do you live?
R:  I -- I live in Delaware, over -- on the east coast, so we're like --
L:  Wow.  So how long have you been in Delaware?
R:  Oh, I think four years.  Um, I don't know, maybe -- maybe we should still talk about holidays.
L:  Well, I was going to ask, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- how many holidays you celebrate now that you live in -- in the United States?
R:  Oh, I mean, we -- you see, the -- the thing is we cannot really celebrate them all the way so, uh, we like to do a little bit, um -- I mean, just -- just -- just all the big -- just all the big ones although, like, you don't have off from work, like you still have to go in and stuff --
L:  [LAUGH] That's --
R:  It's, uh --
L:  That's what makes it a holiday.
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Not having to work. [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  Yeah, you have to be off.  Like, I mean, I like -- here, I mean, I don't know, like, I thought, both of us are graduates from the University of Delaware and, uh, you don't have too many holidays in the -- during the year, like -- like I -- I really love when we have a long weekend so that you can travel, like I really like to travel, uh, but it's -- it's -- the number of long weekends in the year are like three or four.  So, you know, it's -- it's not very conducive to traveling except that you just have to go on a weekday some -- sometimes.
L:  Well --
R:  You --
L:  -- there was this other question about inventing a holiday.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Would you invent a holiday?
R:  What -- say that again?
L:  What holiday would you invent if you were inventing a holiday?
R:  Uh, I guess, uh, for me it would be like, uh -- I mean, I would -- I really would like, like, if, you know, you could be to- -- together with friends and family, just -- just kind of hang out at home and -- and talk and share things with each other and, you know, just -- just build each other up, stuff like that, uh --
L:  What's the -- what's the biggest holiday in India?  What -- what's like the --
R:  Uh, the biggest is -- it's called Devali.
L:  Devali?
R:  Yeah, it's like a festival of light.  People, uh -- what people do is like you would, like -- like, it's like our -- it's like Christmas and you put lights -- people would put lights outside their houses, decorate them, clean -- you know, clean them up real well and the other things that you do is like you exchange gifts with your neighbors, your friends, your family and then you -- you don't -- and on the particular day you -- you -- there are a lot, like a lot of firecrackers, like you -- I mean, so you do that, like a big -- big -- like big -- big number of firecrackers all over.
L:  Oh, this sounds good.  What time of year is that?
R:  That is in, like, late October, early November, so during fall.
L:  I like that one.
R:  It's, uh -- it always fall -- happens when it's a -- it's a new moon, it's always on a new moon day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so it's -- like, the -- the thing goes like, it's a dark night but all the lights make it really bright.
L:  Oh, so everybody has candles and --
R:  Yeah, you have candles, you have, like, lights, uh, uh --
L:  Bonfires?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Do --
R:  Uh, not -- not really bonfires, no, but, uh, lot of fireworks, pretty ... so, yeah, not -- not bon- -- bonfires.  You would -- I mean there are a lot of, like, good food and sw- -- like, uh, sweet -- sweets and desserts, like a lot of sweets.  How about -- how about you?  What -- I mean, what -- I mean, I know you said you don't really have a favorite holiday but --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you say you like -- is like Halloween --
L:  Well, Halloween, I do like Halloween and --
R:  Do you like to dress up as something ev- -- different every year?
L:  Yeah, and I -- actually what I like is that other people do. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  I like it, too, but it's fun to see -- I think it's -- [SIGH] you know, it's so rare to really see, like, somebody express themselves, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in a way because, you know, it -- what they choose to portray themselves as, what they choose for a costume --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- is very telling, you know, I think.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh, what -- I mean, can you think of a favorite -- you know, some -- you know, you or somebody else, like, would dress up as something which you just -- which really struck you, like, you know, "That -- oh, that's so amazing"?
L:  I've seen some amazing ones, uh, so it makes it hard to pick because that's one of the things here in Los Angeles, uh, so many people are in the film business, entertainment business --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that, uh, you go to Halloween parties and you see just unbelievable things [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like out of movie --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, because these are who these people are.
R:  Okay.
L:  And so, uh, yeah, I've seen some pretty amazing ones.
R:  Like --
L:  I think my very fav- -- my favorite one of all time was probably a taco.
R:  A taco?
L:  Yeah, a person dressed as a taco.
R:  Wow, that's very innovative.
L:  It -- it looked -- it was very -- yeah, it was very creative and -- and -- and amusing. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, sure seems like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Taco, uh.
L:  Yeah, a taco.
R:  But what -- how about you, like do you -- do you -- you just like to see people or you also dress up?
L:  Uh, I -- I've been known to dress up.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm -- I [LAUGH] -- I -- I used to like the dressing up part more, now I, sort of, do it just to go along.  I was, uh, an actor for a lot of years --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and, uh, I -- I got --
R:  Were you -- you --  
L:  I got sort of tired of dressing up [LAUGH] but, uh --
R:  Did you do, like, plays or what --
L:  Plays and -- and TV shows --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- and, uh, you know, that sort of thing.
