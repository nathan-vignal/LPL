R:  Hi, uh, my name is Kristy.
L:  Hi, Kristy.  My name is Daniel.
R:  Hi.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  I'm not really sure what I'm doing.  My Mom said that if someone called I was supposed to talk to them.
L:  Pardon?
R:  Uh, my mother told me if someone called I should talk to them.
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.
L:  Sure.
R:  Wonderful.
L:  What are we supposed to talk about?  I didn't really hear the recording.
R:  I didn't either.  I think it said something about what's worse -- gossiping, drinking, smoking?  Then I missed the rest of it.
L:  Okay.  Where shall we start?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I don't know.  I don't even know what this is all about.
L:  Oh, it's like this survey thing and they record our call.
R:  Oh.  And do you know why they're recording our call?
L:  Mm, just for survey purposes.  [LAUGH]  I have no clue.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's -- all I know is for ten minutes we're supposed to talk, they listen in and, uh, they give us the topic to talk about.
R:  Oh.  Do you know why we're talking?
L:  Do I know why we're talking?
R:  Yeah.  Who's doing the survey?
L:  This company -- the company that calls my house every day when I'm not home.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  So, like you're just a regular person too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wonderful.  Where do you live?
L:  Uh, Toronto, Canada.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Ow, interesting, I'm moving up to Syracuse, New York, in about, um, a couple of weeks.
L:  Very cool.  From where?
R:  Um, Illinois right now.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.  I'm gonna go to grad school up there.  And what do you do?
L:  I work for a, uh, financial company.
R:  I see.
L:  Yeah.  Actually I administer U.S. pension funds.
R:  Well, that's exciting.  And you're originally from Canada?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  From Montreal originally and now I live in Toronto.
R:  That's cool.  My friend's going to grad school in, um, London.  Is there like a Western Ontario school somewhere?
L:  Yep.  Yes, there is.
R:  Yeah.
L:  London, Ontario, Western's in London.
R:  Yeah, she's gonna there.
L:  A party school.
R:  Is it?
L:  A huge party school.
R:  That's awesome.  [LAUGH]  I'll have to come visit and party some with her.
L:  It's like the biggest party school in all of Ontario.
R:  Wow!  She went to, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- U. of I. for undergrads.  So --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- Illinois.  Sorry.  I guess U. of I. is a little vague.
L:  That's all right.  I figured it.  [LAUGH]  I figured it out.
R:  So, what kind of people do you usually talk to?
L:  This is the first time I've done this.
R:  Oh.  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I have a buddy who lives in, uh, Connecticut --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he sent me an email going sign up for this, it's really cool.  You talk to someone and you get ten bucks.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like ...
R:  That's what my Mom said.
L:  All right.  So, apparently in Canada we don't get the ten bucks though and by then it was too late for me to like unregister.  So, I was like okay.  I'll try it.
R:  Well, you didn't have to talk still.  I wouldn't have.
L:  No?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't know.
L:  No, but they're calling like every day --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I -- I'm like -- I'm not home that often.  So, when I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like I figured today I might as well answer it so that they'll stop driving my roommates crazy.
R:  Hm.  So, you have a friend in where did you say?  Vermont?
L:  Uh, yeah, well, he's in Connecticut.
R:  Connecticut.  Sorry.  They're all the same to me up there.  I'm [LAUGH] -- and now I'm moving out east and I'm gonna have to actually pay attention to the difference.
L:  Yep.  There you go.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now you're gonna see the cold weather.
R:  Yeah, that's true too.  I hear it snows a lot.  I'm, uh -- that's gonna be interesting.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I can't wait to move somewhere south.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, well, it's -- I mean, I'm fairly far south.  I'm like kinda from -- by St Louis and it snows enough down here that that's enough.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  So, it'll be different.
L:  I get long cold winters here.
R:  Mm.  So, I don't know what else I'm supposed to talk about.  Is ten minutes almost up?  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I have no clue.  I would assume it's only been about five.  I think we're supposed to talk about -- I have no clue.  I -- I heard them talking about habits.
R:  Oh, habits.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  That's interesting.  I missed that part.  I was actually screaming for my dog because she was all the way down --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- the end of the road and so I had my door open yelling for her.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I didn't hear what the ...
L:  I have like a dinner party going on here.
R:  You what?
L:  There's like a dinner party going on at my place right now.
R:  Really?
L:  So, it's kinda ...
R:  Who do you live with?
L:  Uh, I live -- I have a bunch of roommates.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  A bunch of roommates, four of us.  We're actually -- the house is getting sold so we all have to disperse and move out now.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool that you still --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- with some friends.  I've spent the last two years, uh, living by myself and then I'm here with my parents for just a month before I move again.  It's really strange.
L:  Yeah, I know.  Tell me about it.
R:  Coming back home for a little while.
L:  Uh, I know.  Awful.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, how old are you?
R:  I am twenty two.
L:  Twenty two.
R:  And yourself?
L:  I'm twenty nine.
R:  I see.  [MN]
L:  Shall we talk about habits?
R:  Habits.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, well ...
L:  Do you drink coffee?
R:  Oh, I do drink coffee.
L:  There you go.
R:  Yes, uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I got addicted to a little coffee shop down the street from me, you know, 'cause I walk my dog every morning and my dog would sit outside while I go get my coffee and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- talk to everyone and ...
L:  Yeah.  I usually have a couple of like extra large coffees a day, but I just recently quit coffee.
R:  [MN].
L:  No more coffee for me.
R:  Yeah.  If I don't -- my parents don't have a coffee maker.  So, I've been doing Diet Coke a lot.
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's not good for you either.  [LAUGH]
R:  No, probably neither of 'em are, but that's just how it works.
L:  How 'bout smoking, do you smoke?
R:  No, not at all.
L:  No.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah, I do.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I did for a while in my, um, sophomore year of college.  I don't know what that was all about.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I decided I was too good.
L:  Yeah.  I'm addicted and, uh, trying to quit.
R:  I know lots of people who did that -- or who were trying to quit.
L:  Yeah.  It's not easy.  Sure wish I never started.  I really do.
R:  How -- when did you start?
L:  Uh, in high school.
R:  Ah, that's a long time then.
L:  Yeah.  I was like seventeen -- sixteen, seventeen, and I was stupid.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's what I thought when I did it.  So, I stopped that real quick.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, what else?  Do you go drinking?
R:  What?
L:  Do you drink?
R:  Um, yeah, a lot.  [LAUGH]
L:  A lot?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  What do you drink?
R:  I figure I'm twenty two, I'm entitled to that.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's right.  You had to wait a while.
R:  Well ...
L:  The legal age here is nineteen.
R:  I know.  But, I mean -- yeah, I mean, I've been able to for a long time, but I'm just saying in general --
L:  What do you drink?
R:  -- I'm young enough.  I'm still allowed to get drunk all the time.  Um, what do I drink?
L:  Yeah, what's your drink of choice?
R:  Uh, probably Bud Light.
L:  Bud Light?
R:  Mm.  Yeah.  If I had a choice, like if they sold different types of beer --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- like, you know, different bars have different beers on tap?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like -- I like draft beer.
L:  Cool.
R:  So, depending.  And yourself?
L:  Yeah.  I'm a beer person.  I like beer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like Canadian beer.
R:  Yeah?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What kind?
L:  Um, I like Moosehead.  You ever heard of Moosehead?
R:  Yes, I have.  I've actually tried it.
L:  Moosehead is one of my favorites.  Um, I like Alexander Keiths.  That's not Canadian though is it?  Oh, it might be.
R:  I've never tried that.
L:  From Halifax.  Uh ...
R:  Oh, I think I have tried that.
L:  Yeah?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, now that you say that.
L:  Keiths?
R:  I like -- yeah, that's the thing I do.  I like to try different beers.
L:  Corona I like.  That's Mexican.
R:  Yeah, that is, yeah.
L:  With the lime in it, oh, it's so good.
R:  I like Corona too.  One time I actually bought a case from a liquor store and bought, uh, some limes with it.
L:  Right.
R:  That was interesting.
L:  Uh, it's one of my favorite summer beers.
R:  Yeah.  It was the summer.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  We were outside on the porch barbecuing.
L:  That's the best.
R:  It seemed like what I should drink.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, what else?  I think Crown Raw Rye, rye and ginger ale.
R:  Mm.
L:  If I have to drink hard liquor that's my ...
R:  I'm not a big mix drink [NOISE] person at all.
L:  [COUGH] No?
R:  No.  I won't even have a drink anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm mostly just beer.
L:  I've tried a lot.  I use to bar tend in college.  So ...
R:  I'm -- I started that actually.  I, um -- I waitressed for eight years and I asked my restaurant if I could bartend a few times so I'd get a little experience 'cause I wanna get a bartending job in Syracuse.  So ...
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  So, I'm working on that.
L:  That's great.
R:  But it doesn't matter, most people just drink beer anyway.
L:  Depends where you go, yeah.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  It definitely does depend where you go.
L:  I worked in my college pub.  So, it's more like the guys all drink beer and the girls all drink mix drinks.
R:  Ah, that would -- that would -- I never was mix drink person, no.
L:  No, I'm not -- me either.  [LAUGH]  Not me either.  So, what else?  Um, I don't know what else we're supposed to talk about.
R:  So, you have a dinner party.  What are they eating for dinner?
L:  Uh, roast beef.  Roast beef, potatoes and salads.
R:  Has that been cooking all day?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ow, that sounds good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We had pork burgers this evening on the grill.  That was good too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sounds good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This is all oven roasted.  My -- my buddy's roommate's father came in from Florida and cooked this whole spread for us.
R:  Wow!  That's nice.
L:  So, it's pretty cool.  It's his birthday that's why.
R:  Fine.  But those are fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I'm having a party tomorrow night with some friends.  We've having, um, a tournament, uh, pool, darts, fizz ball and quoits. 
L:  Very cool.
R:  So, I'm pretty excited about playing in that --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- [inaudible] some things and stuff.
L:  Where's that at?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Where's the party at?
R:  Uh, just at my parents' house downstairs --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- in the basement.
L:  The basement sounds like mine.  I got a pool table, fizz ball table --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ping pong.
R:  Yeah, with ping pong too.  But the -- the theme of the party is [inaudible] and I wasn't sure ping pong was a bar -- was a bar sport, like a game.
L:  Of course it is.
R:  So --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- we left that one out.  What?
L:  There's no question, of course it is.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's gonna be fun 'cause -- I don't know -- so, I have all these people coming and give prizes and it's exciting.  I've been planning it for a while.
L:  That's cool.
R:  I like to do stuff like that.
L:  That sounds great.
R:  Or you just keep going to the bars and spending lots of money and ...
L:  Sounds like a good time.  I wish Illinois wasn't so far --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'd crash your party.
R:  Yeah, you could drive down.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's pretty far though.  I'm about four hours south of Chicago.  So, I mean, I'm real far down the state.
L:  It's, uh -- yeah, it's pretty far I think.
R:  Do you feel like I talk with a southern accent?
L:  Not so bad.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  No, I -- everyone says I don't.  I think it's strange how people think it's so far south, but I don't know.
L:  Well, you know, I had a -- a training session thing and, uh, the woman who came in to do the training session was from Illinois --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she had the southern accent, like -- like -- just like in the movies.
R:  Yeah.  I don't understand how some --
