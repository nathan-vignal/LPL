R:  Hi.  I'm Elaine from New York [NOISE].
L:  Hi, there.  My name's Kenneth.
R:  Hey, how you doing?
L:  I'm okay, thanks, not bad.
R:  Well, that's good.  Good.  Where you calling from?
L:  Dallas.
R:  Uh, how's everybody in Dallas?
L:  Uh, it's been raining for a few days but it seems to be okay.
R:  Yeah, it's raining over here, too.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Uh, New York.
L:  Uh, right. Okay.  Makes sense.  So, we're talking about reality TV are we?
R:  Yes, we are [LIPSMACK].
L:  Mm.
R:  Do you watch --
L:  Scary.
R:  -- those programmes or not really [LAUGH]?
L:  Uh, I watched the first and part of the second Survivor and, uh, I watched an episode of Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?
R:  [NOISE] I've watched -- I watched the first Survivor and I've seen, uh, Who wants to marry a -- you know, I've seen Who wants to marry a millionaire and what other shows have I seen?  Uh, Fear Factor [NOISE]?
L:  Yeah, watched a lot of Fear Factor, yes, that's good.
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  Um, Big --
L:  It's big stuff.
R:  -- Brother --
L:  Nah.
R:  -- and I've seen The Real World 'cause that was the first reality show --
L:  No chance.
R:  -- on MTV?
L:  Nah, I didn't see that at all.
R:  Yeah [NOISE].  They're okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  I -- I don't know.  I'm tired of that whole genre [NOISE].
L:  Yeah, they need to get rid of it.  It's just a waste of time.  Um --
R:  [NOISE] I think it's a waste of time and I hate to say this but I think [NOISE] the people who participate in these things, I'm sure they're well paid and I ha- I have a feeling that they're, like, actors or something and that 'cause they're all good looking and they all j- -- you know what I mean?  It's just -- it just seems contrived.  I don't know.
L:  It almost seems like a farce.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You sit there and look at it and everybody knows what they've got to do and everybody knows where their place is and everybody is, like you said, they're all good looking or prim and proper.
R:  Right.
L:  You don't see too many overweight people and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, uh, it's just like okay.
R:  I know 'cause I don't -- I don't see regular looking people.  They -- they all look as, you know, only they all look like actors to me.  I don't know.  It's just the way they are, you know [NOISE]?
L:  Yeah, yeah, but, uh, I think --
R:  And how can you -- how can you subject yourself to that type of situation where you know millions of people are watching you make an idiot out of yourself, an ass out of yourself, and you're humiliating yourself in the process, eating bugs and things like that and whatever for a million dollars.  I find that -- I don't know.
L:  Oh, a million dollars is a big money.  I mean, there's --
R:  I- it --
L:  There's a lot that I --
R:  It is but I --
L:  -- would do for a million dollars.
R:  You know.  I don't know.  I mean, I've seen the Ba- the Bachelor and shows like that.  I think it's -- it's pretty humiliating, you know [LIPSMACK].
L:  Yeah, there's a line on -- on interesting versus humiliating and I think that the Survivor series started out really good, and when they did Survivor Africa --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- 'cause that's where I'm from, I was, like, "Oh, now, that's pretty cool", and then they -- I watched some of that and they did some goofy stuff --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in there and I was just, like, "If you were out in the bush in Africa, man, you'd be eaten by now" --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- so, b- -- it is a sh- -- you know, they -- they started off really good but now they're getting to a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- point of being pathetic.
R:  That's true [NOISE].
L:  It's like, "Who cares about American Idol or American Juniors?"  It's like --
R:  I know.
L:  -- "Come on", and I can't believe they waste airtime on this.  I'd rather watch adverts than that, you know.
R:  A lot of it's crap now 'cause they're coming out with shows that have no reason for being on the air.  It's just -- just to just tantalize people to humiliate people.  I know they have Mister Personality with Monica Lewinsky as the host.  You know, they --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've never seen it.  I've heard about it.  I won't watch it because I think it's -- i- it's very, you know what I mean?  It's -- it's trash [NOISE].  I think they have --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- these guys.  They -- they're putting ass on them and the woman tries to pick one of them out according to his personality not by his looks and everything like that [MN] but then when -- when, uh, he's unmasked he could be ugly or he could be [LAUGH] -- he could be really handsome, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, uh, I think it's humiliating.  I really, you know, I don't -- I -- I just -- I just find these type of shows demeaning [NOISE].
L:  But it seems that the general American populace wants to see it.
R:  I know.
L:  It doesn't matter how dull it is --
R:  I know.
L:  -- it just gets them out of the mundane part of their life.
R:  Oh, that's true.
L:  They're like, "Oh, well, somebody else is getting something else --" 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- going on so therefore it's interesting".
R:  That's true, that's true.
L:  I think, uh, people need to pick up a book or play a computer game or something.
R:  And you would think you would root for your fellow man but I guess not.  You just want to see someone get dumped or someone get humiliated or, yeah, you know what I mean.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  It's -- they need to stop wasting film on this stuff.
R:  I know, I know [NOISE].
L:  So, it just doesn't make sense but, I mean, considered if that's what the people want --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that's what they're going to get.
R:  [NOISE] I know.  
L:  So -- but, uh, I mean, what else, uh, this is my first call that I've made through here so we just talk like this for ten minutes?
R:  Absolutely.  This is my second call 'cause I actually registered yesterday.
L:  [NOISE] Uh, right.
R:  Yes- the -- the to- the topic that I had yesterday was, uh, which is worse?  Uh, over eating, not exercising, um, I think, being an alcoholic, uh, drinking too much caffeine?
L:  Now, there's nothing wrong with caffeine.  Don't go there.
R:  Oh, no, there's nothing wrong with caffeine.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't think so either.  
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I agree with you a hundred percent.  I'm a big soda junkie so, you know [NOISE].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and all -- I think there was also alcoholism was one, over eating was another.  I'm trying to think of, uh -- [NOISE] I can't remember the other one but, you know, we were going on and on.  I said, "To me I think, uh, alcoholism will kill you so that's a pretty bad vice right there.  Overeating's not a really big issue unless you have a history of heart disease in your family or something" you know, that -- 
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  -- kind of thing.  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, well, I guess it'll be interesting to see what other topics I get but they're --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, this is not bad.  Ten dollars a call.  Hey, I could do this every day --
L:  Yeah, really?
R:  -- but the woman -- the woman who I spoke to she said, "I think the calls are, like, at random every two days or so".  You're not going to get a call every day but, hey, you know, but you should just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just be available whenever you're supposed to be getting a call, you know.
L:  I guess the question is what do they do with this stuff?  They have some shrink listen to it?
R:  Well, who knows [LAUGH]?
L:  Maybe it's a scam and they, uh, they're just collecting cellphone demographics.
R:  [NOISE] Could be, could be [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that's -- seems to be logical.  Oh, well, have some shrink analysing why I call him a shrink.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think this man is, uh, constipated and, uh, uh, whatever.  Uh, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is there more schemes like this where you phone in, like, ten dollars a shot?
R:  [NOISE] Oh, I [NOISE] um, this is, like, the first one I've heard.  Have you done one market research like taken surveys?
L:  Uh, no but I've got a friend who takes all kinds of surveys.
R:  Yeah, I love those --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause I know there's this one website called, um, Focus Room dot com.
L:  Focus Room dot com?
R:  Yeah, and what you do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is, like, you register on line [LIPSMACK].  You know, you give your -- [NOISE] your personal information --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- about yourself as far as creating a profile, your age, um, I guess what type of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, your likes, your dislikes, you know.
L:  Hm.
R:  Yeah, your -- your own personal st- statistics and what happens is that they take that into consideration.  They -- they call you regarding different, uh, I guess different studies that may -- they may have, like, for example --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they have a, uh, a focus group on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, beverages, like, soft drinks --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff like that.  They ask you, like, how many times a week do you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- drink them?  What types of [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- soft drinks do you drink etcetera, etcetera.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They have you come in and you just, like, pretty much, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- have a discussion with all these other people about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these different, uh, beverages and stuff like that and you get paid cash so they get, you know, for your time which is not bad.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, not bad at all.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'll have to check that out.  Focus Room dot com.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I got, like, eighty five dollars for my time I did.  I participated in the snack study and, like, okay [LAUGH]. 
L:  Uh, well, the -- I suppose we should touch back on the topic of, uh, topic of the day though.
R:  Oh, yeah, that's true.
L:  See you later [NOISE].
R:  That's true.
L:  Yeah, bye.
R:  Yeah, I don't like those reality programmes.  I don't know.  They're interesting to a certain point but then they get ludicrous when [NOISE] -- you know what I mean?  They -- they just put anything on, any -- any kind of trash that they figure would appeal to the American public, you know.
L:  Yeah, I'm waiting till they put reality TV on that involves some guy mowing lawn.  I might watch that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause that might be interesting --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- especially if they have a variety of lawns in there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and maybe different kinds of lawnmowers.
R:  True.
L:  That might be interesting, you know, but seeing some middle aged half talented guy go up there and try and sing and then, just like, "You know what? [SIGH] Please don't show me this junk".
R:  Yeah, and then they had this modeling one and I'm like, "I don't need to see this on TV".
L:  [NOISE]
R:  To me that's like, um, watching beauty contests on TV [NOISE].  I really don't -- I don't go for that --
L:  Um, apple shows.
R:  -- and, like, it's pretty sexist.  I think it's sexist.  That and -- I don't see any male beauty pageants so I'm just like, [LAUGH] to be judged -- 
L:  Well, who want's to look at the man's figure?
R:  -- on your looks is a very superficial and very -- it's very inane to me.  I'm just like, "Please" you know?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Uh, but again if the American people want to see --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, middle aged -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- half naked men in a fashion show --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I'm sure somebody, probably, uh, Jerry Bruckheimer would be out there --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- filming it.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah [NOISE].
L:  So, that's just the way it goes.
R:  Then you have those talk shows on TV which exploit everybody, you know, like Ricki Lake and ...
