R:  Hi, this is Kathleen[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Jacqui[?] from Michigan.
R:  Oh, I'm from Michigan too.
L:  Okay.  Well, I'm driving my car --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- while we're talking. [LAUGH] So, I hope it's not a problem for your hearing me.
R:  No, let me know if you need --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- me to speak up.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]  Um --
R:  So, which one of those did you think was worse? [MN]
L:  [LAUGH] Do you know, you're not going to believe it, but I'm, sort of, [several inaudible words - not English], I'm not really into a- -- worrying about other people's personal habits.  I --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I -- I have friends that are avid anti smokers and other friends who -- you know what I mean?  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- it just -- those habits don't bother me very much when they belong to somebody else. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, the only one that struck me -- that would bother me, just because it's -- it's not something that's personal, it can hurt others, is the gossiping.
L:  Yeah, there you go.  Excellent.  Good point.  I would agree totally.  Absolutely.
R:  And I know -- I don't know what your work place is -- is like or, you know, family even, um, [LAUGH] it happens everywhere --
L:  Oh, really.
R:  -- it always seems to hurt everybody, you know --
L:  I gotta tell you though --
R:  -- there's nothing -- good gossip.
L:  -- I've laughed in the past and gone, "Oh, jeeze --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I could use a laugh" so.  But -- you know?  But I like it --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- light hearted.
R:  Yes.
L:  I have not liked it when it's been vindictive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and -- and, ah, what would you say when people get into being critical and all of that?
R:  Right.
L:  But it's hard not to get caught up in it, I'll be the first to admit.
R:  Oh, it -- and it is, it really can, kind of, set the tone too.  I know that -- um, it -- you know, I've worked in different places and some places where there's not a lot of gossip, it's a totally different, um, feeling there than when you've got all these people who do, you know, gossip all the time.
L:  I used to be a Manager where [several inaudible words] thousands of people and even in the group that worked within me, it always amazed me -- gossip would develop on some issue --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and it starts getting a life of its own --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and even if you laid out facts in front of people at that point, they had made their perception, you know what I mean?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And it was very difficult to deal with as a manager --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when that would happen.
R:  Isn't it funny how -- just the human nature, we do like to find the worst in somebody else to make us feel better.
L:  I guess I'm just terrible too, because I gotta admit at times I've had a --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] -- you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, "Oh, no kidding.  They're doing what?" [LAUGH] you know?  And I'd like to believe I'm above it, but I got to say, if I'm honest --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- that there has been times where I'm, "No kidding?" you know, I -- and that sort of thing -- and frankly, some times gossip has helped me professionally considerably because it gave me sort of a free [several inaudible words] the winds of something or other.
R:  That's true.  That's true.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- well, not all gossip is al- always bad, but you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know, you hear somebody's expecting a baby or whatever and that could be good news, it just -- you know?
L:  Yeah.  Right.  But it -- it is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- unfortunate isn't it, because it is sort of public nature to go, "No kidding?" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  It's something that -- and it is so hurtful, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- jeeze, um, yeah.  And then there's --
R:  And all the other ones that they have listed here --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- like you said are -- are -- you know, who am I to say if you should exercise more or have less caffeine or, you know, drinking alcohol --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- if you're driving I guess it's a problem but --
L:  Yeah, then it becomes our problem --
R:  -- you know?
L:  -- right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree.
R:  But if -- if you're not then why would that be something I, you know?
L:  Yeah, I know.  I guess I'm not very moralistic or maybe I should be moreso but I'm sort of like, I have enough trouble just getting my little --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- life going along and straight now. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can't be worried about -- you know, if I thought -- I -- if I honestly thought somebody I was close to and that I cared about was self destructing --
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  -- I suspect I would attempt to do some sort of intervention --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, if it was alcohol or something, but generally I figure people pick the paths and --
R:  Well, what about --
L:  --  you know, if they fall --
R:  -- you personally --
L:  Oh, heck I --
R:  -- which one of those for yourself?
L:  I -- al- -- oh my God, I'm always making goals.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm going to better and [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, I know, I was laughing at the overeating and exercise one.  I'm like, "Well, they're [LAUGH] ...".
L:  Oh, I mean -- but I'm so old now --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't have too many vices left. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You don't want to use any of that energy up.
L:  Well, I -- I do try to be sensitive.  I am a smoker --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I do try to be extremely sensitive about that, but then if somebody gives me a really bad time, especially --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- after I've gone outside and have been real careful, then I go, "Well, other than that, I'm practically perfect in every way, so" [LAUGH] you know?
R:  And it's just the smoking. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I go, "Mary Poppins and me" you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But yeah, I just -- you know and as far a -- yeah, personal habits.  Oh, my gosh I've always got a list of, "I'm going to be better at"--
R:  Yup.  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, sometimes I'm lucky and I'm successful and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  --sometimes I slip and I gear back up, you know?  But --
R:  Well, and you gotta -- you have to live too and sometimes --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- those personal habits that are con- -- perceived as -- by our society negative --
L:  Dog -- doggone it they're so much fun sometimes. [LAUGH]
R: Yeah.  I know. [LAUGH] I know.
L:  Oh.
R:  What would life be without them?
L:  Yeah.  But it -- but I -- I do have friends that have very strong feelings on some of those --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- areas.  Um, I have a sister who, I mean, just has a -- goes nuts and about overweight people [several inaudible words] some insecurity of her own and she moved down south and she's always talking about everybody up here --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, in Michigan, and how bad they are and I always think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Oh, I love it.  I found a statistic that -- that Houston people were worse than Michigan people" [LAUGH].
R:  Well, actually I live in Tennessee right now --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but we're from Michigan --
L:  Yeah?
R:  -- so they're just as fat down here. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's really funny but I mean, you know -- and I've got another friend who just goes bonkers on the issue of smoking and stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if there's even anybody in the ro- -- I mean, she's just way over the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, I just figure I have so much trouble with my own life, I can't be worried about everybody elses.  But you may --
R:  Well, what is it -- is it New York city that has it where -- it's like even in the bars, you can't smoke in any building?
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] it's getting tough, boy. [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that amazing?
L:  I'm saving a lot of money. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  By the time I get there, I don't have time to do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Ah --
L:  But I agree with you, that was a -- really a good point.  Yeah, gossip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Gossip is probably the -- you're right, the one or -- and you're also right when your freedom starts getting in the way of my survival [several inaudible words].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] [LAUGH] you know?  I -- I -- [inaudible] --
R:  And what people do in their own homes, you know, I don't think that should be dictated.
L:  I've a -- yeah, I'm sort of there too.  I'm -- I'm just, ah, you know -- I'm -- I can't walk in someone else's -- well, I'll be honest, my [inaudible] used to be in social work so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I probably have a -- and gosh no, I've seen the both of it [several inaudible words] hard --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I may not like some of their behaviours but I just, you know -- I just -- I just don't seem --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to have as big a crazy on as some of my friends do on some issues, but  --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you're right, it's a good point.  Good point.  Anyway, so other than that what do you think? [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] [LAUGH] Ho- -- now, have you been doing this for awhile, calling in?
L:  This is my third conversation.
R:  Isn't it fun?
L:  Um, it's such a unique e- experience, ah, I -- I got a real kick, my first one almost threw me off the chair.  I -- he -- he sounded like a young fellow and he, um -- he was -- obviously had some old garbage --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- [inaudible] [LAUGH] evidently.  [several inaudible words] I felt like I was back in practice.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But it was -- it was interesting.  Yeah, this has been very interesting, but this is the first subject they've thrown at me that I'm just sort of like, "Um.  Okay".
R:  You don't really have any thoughts on? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I think actually you've made great points that I should have thought of.  You're right, when that behaviour gets in the way and possibly harming me or mine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then I have a high level of interest --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and when the behaviour is at such a point that it's harmful of others, then you're right.  You're absolutely right, I have a high level, but if it's a behaviour to the individual, gosh I gotta let them have their room to make their own choices. [MN]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know -- I mean, I've seen mothers who give their infants Coke in a bottle and that's caffeine and stuff and you're like, "Oh, my gosh" [LAUGH].  Yeah.
L:  Okay, you've just made another great point.  You're right, when it's -- when it's, ah, dependents --
R:  Right.
L:  -- a vulnerable dependent --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- put in the situation of someone who could -- I mean, I don't even -- I have three granddaughters and when they're in the car, man, we just stop and I get out if I have to absolutely have it.  I mean, I just -- you know, yeah.
R:  Gotta have it. [LAUGH]
L:  But you're right, when you see little ones and they're being exposed to stuff, you know, that's ju- -- or people who perhaps are drinkers and have children --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- around.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, we're back to just yourself or you're harming somebody else, eh?
R:  Yeah, but ah -- you know, o- our lives are so intertwined, I guess, you know, you could harm anybody in your family directly in a relationship with you, with any of these, you know?  Even --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- overeating and not exercising increases your risks for heart disease and stroke and --
L:  And [several inaudible words] you can get into that whole --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and society pays more stuff --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] I'm so imperfect, it's hard for me --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to give anybody [LAUGH] else a rough time.
R:  That's right.  That's right.
L:  I've tried with a halo all the time. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Mine's always slipping.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh and you know, you can't live your life, you know, trying to always be perfect.
L:  Or expecting the world to be.
R:  That's right.  Yeah --
L:  Yeah, you're right, that's a lot of energy.
R:  -- you can't have it for yourself
