R:  Oh, hi my name is Dilly[?].
L:  Hi, I'm Gretchen[?].
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do you, ah, watch reality shows?
L:  I have watched them a couple of times, but -- some are okay, but some of them, I don't know, the moral values there, I think, are kind of not so good.  Like on the meet someone to get married [LAUGH] type thing.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Oh, I have to be honest with you.  Ah, I've -- I have never watched a reality show.  I just -- I -- I -- maybe it's a function of being both busy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I -- I guess, ah, for me the, um -- the concept, I -- I -- I guess maybe it bothers me a little. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it does.  I really -- I watched, um, a couple of ep- episodes of that Joe Millionaire and it was kind of ridiculous because here everything, you know, was based on a total lie and --
R:  Right.  Exactly. [NOISE]
L:  -- so to me that was kind of weird and I can't say that I watched the whole episode, just kind of flipping through every once in awhile --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I think I've watched the Survivor thing one time.  But yeah, I just -- I think I'd rather [LAUGH] stick with something that -- just like I say, the moral values don't seem to --
R:  Right.  They just seem to be --
L:  -- be really right there.
R:  Yeah, they seem to be kind of shallow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I -- I think a --
L:  As my husband says, "It's so stupid, I can't believe anybody [LAUGH] would watch this stuff". [LAUGH]
R:  Well -- you know, my husband watched it a little bit and then -- well -- ah, he was watching [several inaudible words] -- he was watching Joe Millionaire and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- ah -- and I -- I didn't say anything to him.  I thought, "Well, my goodness [LAUGH] what is -- why is he getting hooked on this?" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then -- and then finally he said, "You know, th- this whole thing is based on a lie" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and he said, "Ah, why am I watching this?" and I said, "Well, I -- I -- I don't know" and I have a sister in law who just would not miss any Survivor show.
L:  Yeah, I just can't --
R:  She's just driven by it.
L:  -- I just can't get into it.  I -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And just -- I know that there was a new one out and I had never seen it and it had something to do with -- you're supposed to -- they were matching these people up, I guess to get married, you know?  I'm thinking --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "So, they're just getting married".  I mean, to me, marriage is a lifetime thing, you don't just meet someone then try to go from [LAUGH] you know, there and --
R:  Yeah and hope that it works.
L:  -- [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.  It doesn't seem right. [LAUGH] But --
R:  But it -- yeah and I guess -- you know, the -- one of the other questions that we're supposed to address is why are they so popular and I -- and I guess I -- that's something that's -- you know, I've asked myself, but --
L:  It's surprising.  But you know --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- you kind of look at the way society is today --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and maybe that's why.  I mean, a lot of people, I guess their values aren't maybe what, you know, they should be or the that way things used to be.
R:  Yeah, the way things used to be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- yeah, I guess they -- the, um [MN]-- ah, there seems to be a pervasive, ah -- to me, a pervasive shallowness --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that, um -- and it -- you know -- and it -- I wonder, you know, when they say the word reality, is it really reality or are these people paid --
L:  I know.  I wonder that too.
R:  -- to act and I thought, "You know, that --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- that would be a really -- really silly way to -- to dupe the American [LAUGH] public". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well -- and it's almost like they tried this to see if people would watch it and they did and all of a sudden -- and it's -- it's sad to say that it's almost like maybe some people enjoy seeing, you know, others fall, [LAUGH] you know, in a sense, you know?
R:  Right.  Yeah.  And then -- that is -- that is sad.
L:  It is, because I mean -- just -- you know, to find out -- I just can't imagine that these people who are on the show and the way everything went, that they did not have any idea that --
R:  Yeah, that they were totally clueless.
L:  Right.  I mean, you had to have --
R:  Yeah, it does seem to be --
L:  -- some type of, you know, I don't -- whether they do or not, I don't know, but yeah, I'm just -- it does -- and I'm -- I'm curious to what type of crowd, if it draws in all ages of viewing that like this --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- reality TV or not.
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] --
L:  I mean -- because it's really gotten big what, just in the last probably year?
R:  Right.  It really has, to the point that there's going to be a whole, ah -- a channel --
L:  Oh, is there?
R:  -- devoted to -- yes, a whole reality network --
L:  Oh, my God.
R:  -- with non stop twenty four seven reality [LAUGH] shows.  I --
L:  Well -- you know, and everybody complained about soap operas, but at least we knew that these weren't [LAUGH] you know [several inaudible words].
R:  Well, we -- you know, we [LAUGH] --
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- we knew upfront we were -- yeah, we were getting h- hooked on something that, you know, wasn't real.  I don't know if people like, um, seeing other people troubled, if -- you know, is -- is their life not real enough to them that they --
L:  Or maybe [LAUGH] it makes them feel better, maybe their lives are that bad that it makes them feel, "Oh, mine's not so bad". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  "Oh -- oh, my husband beats me, that's okay, it's better than being on reality TV". [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Now, I will admit though, my kids like watching this -- the Fear Factor, I don't know if that's kind of considered reality TV, it's more of a game show, but -- and some of the stuff --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is just crazy on it.  But the -- the kids like it and if it's not too --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- gory, I let em watch it, but ...
R:  Yeah, I -- it is, I've -- I've caught glimpses of it while it's been on -- while I was cooking dinner it just happened to be on and, um --
L:  And I think something like that is actually -- the stuff they're doing is so way out there that it's almost, "Oh, my gosh, are they going to really do this?" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it kind of keeps you on your -- you know, the seat of your chair, the suspense.
R:  Yeah, it's more the suspense, the adrenalin rush --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe like -- almost like some of the extreme sports -- well, when they initially were being televised [inaudible].
L:  Right.  Yeah, I agree, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, I don't know.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  And so -- are you -- are -- ah, the way that this is -- this is my first call, so -- because this --
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, this is like my -- my third.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, I'm --
R:  So, I was nervous the first time.  I really was. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm just -- well, you're just another person and we're just chit chatting and they're recording our conversation then to see our views on this, is that [several inaudible words] --
R:  I guess so --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I don't know if they're, you know, doing something --
L:  But you're not actually from the [LAUGH] place that [several inaudible words] --
R:  No, no, no.
L:  Okay.
R:  No, I'm -- I'm actually from outside of Al Paso, Texas.  I'm a real person and --
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'm in --
R:  Ah, I just --
L:  -- Indiana, so [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  Oh, what part of Indiana?
L:  In, um, the right -- the north east corner --
R:  North east ...
L:  -- um, we're like five miles from Michigan and fives miles from Ohio --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- right up in the corner, but I do have friends that are from, um, Dallas, Texas --
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, see I --
L:  -- that have just moved here.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, I grew up in Dallas --
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  -- it's a small world.  Yeah, and I a- --
L:  We're on the outskirts, yeah.
R:  Well -- and I lived in -- ah, outside of Indianapolis.  I worked at --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- Ball State University for three years when I first graduated --
L:  Oh and I swear --
R:  -- from college, yeah.
L:  I have, um, some neighbors that are here that are seasonal, because we live in a lake, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- she teaches at Ball -- um, I don't think at Ball State, but they're from Muncie there and they live at -- her husband has something to do with Ball State --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and it -- yeah, it's just a like a small world. [LAUGH]
R:  I -- and it's kind of a neat thing of doing this, I -- I wish we could do more than three calls because --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- I've -- I've really met something really interesting people --
L:  Oh, I bet.
R:  -- over the phone.
L:  Do they --
R:  Yeah, I think --
L:  -- call -- I mean, do you get your calls all like in the same week or do they space it out or ...?
R:  Well, what I did -- wh- what I opted to do was to place the call myself, because my schedule is so erratic --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that, ah -- that I called the number and they -- you know, then they put me on hold and they said, "We'll try to find somebody --"
L:  Yeah.  Um, this is my first one --
R:  "-- to put you in touch with".
L:  -- and I missed my calls and so I called that number and did it that way and -- but I just signed up, I think, like a day or two ago, so.
R:  Oh, did you?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I -- I signed up, um, I guess it was maybe Tuesday --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- yeah, but I had a --
L:  Are we supposed to actually talk the full ten minutes about [LAUGH] the subject.
R:  [several inaudible words] and then they -- and then they'll come on and they'll say, "Your ten minutes is up and you can -- you know, can say goodbye now" --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and so -- and then it's over. [LAUGH] It's -- it's strange, but it's kind of neat.
L:  Yeah.  So -- I mean, I didn't know if like we're get in trouble here, because we're still not [LAUGH] talking about reality TV or ...
R:  Well, yeah, I guess -- I don't know, but maybe we should kind of go back --
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay. [LAUGH]
R:  -- to it, ah -- [inaudible] -- yeah, that's me, I'm like, "I don't know" [LAUGH] but --
L:  Well, it is kind of weird though that they have as many out now as they do of the different ones.
R:  Yeah and that they've taken so many different twists --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, you know, the -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  Because it did kind of start off with the Survivor type stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then it went off into -- which I guess wasn't that big of a deal, but then they had one -- now that you say that, a couple of years -- it wasn't a couple of years, maybe last year and it was all these men and all these women were put on islands and -- or something together and they were allowed to date each other and it was --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  -- I just remember seeing it and it was -- even the previews were pretty, um -- and it was on normal TV but it seemed to be pretty risque --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, but I mean, they were -- the men were trying to, almost like vote for what women they like and the -- maybe the guys the same and I really couldn't tell you because I never really sat and watched it.
R:  Never really watched it?
L:  No.
R:  Yeah.  That's -- that's, ah -- that's bringing a -- almost bringing a bar scene into your home. [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  Yeah, y- --
R:  On prime time it's -- that's a --
L:  It is and I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at the point that I flipped through, it's like you know everybody's in swimsuits and they were, you know, drinking outside on this island and you know?
R:  Yeah, I think I kind of caught glimpses of it or maybe the commercials --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I thought, "Well, what are they doing?  What is the point of this show?".
L:  Because there was one couple that had been together for like so many years and it was almost like, "Could they withstand the temptation of another?" or something, because they're --
R:  Right.  Yeah, maybe it was actually Temptation Island, maybe that was the, ah --
L:  Oh, yeah that -- now that you say that, that does sound kind of familiar.
R:  Well, maybe that -- yeah a- and wow.
L:  And that's one's pretty -- I mean, what -- when you think about, what is really the point of that, you know?
R:  Yeah, it -- yeah, again, it is a concern and I -- and I wonder why people w- would want something like that unless you're trying to get ideas. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  You know -- I mean --
R:  You know?  Okay.
L:  -- y- -- I remembered -- I just remember seeing the previews and they were saying something about -- there was one couple that had been together like four years and it was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- all couples that were like couples but they were not married --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but I'm just like what kind of -- you know, what kind of outlook does that give to younger people too, you know, younger kids?
R:  Right.  And what -- and -- and if a person's in a committed relationship why would they want to go on it -- you know, go on TV and do something like that, unless it's the lure of money maybe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I know they've got to be paid to do that.
L:  I would think.  But yeah, it almost seems --
R:  [several inaudible words] moment of fame
