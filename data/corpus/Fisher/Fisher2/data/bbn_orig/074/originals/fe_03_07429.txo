L:  Hi.
R:  [LAUGH] This is Beth.
L:  This is Michelle.
R:  Okay.  So, we're discussing, what is it, reality TV?
L:  That's correct.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Which shows do you watch?
R:  Okay.  Um, I have to admit that I am actually a reality television addict.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, at least, you know, some of them, so.
L:  I act- -- well, yeah, I could say the same for --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- myself, you know?  Started out with the MTV. [LAUGH]
R:  Yep, the real world. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so -- and it has graduated to a lot of the -- the shows that are on the regular TV now, so.
R:  Exactly.  I've started with the, um -- what was it, the one that's on Fox?  It was -- oh, what was it?  Joe Millionaire I started watching.
L:  Oh, right.  Right.
R:  And I got addicted to that because I'm like, "I can't believe they're actually on here, you know, doing this".
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I watched that.  Um, I do watch the -- the dating, um, one -- on channel, I don't -- ah -- well, I'm from New York so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- there's a dating one on channel nine --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um --
R:  Oh, is that like Blind Date or something?
L:  Yeah, that one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and I like the -- the new one by Tara Banks, the models.
R:  Oh, I haven't seen that one.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Love that one. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, interesting.  What's that one about?
L:  Um, basically who's going to be the top model.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  How could I miss that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words].
L:  There's a lot of cat fights.  Really [LAUGH] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- really fun to watch.
R:  Interesting.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  I'll have to check that out.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um -- yeah and I was a Survivor buff but I -- I [several inaudible words] slow down on that one, so.
R:  Yeah, I wasn't very interested with the last couple of seasons, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] I like Fear Factor, it's different.
R:  Yeah, that's -- some of them I like.  Oh, I can't even watch it because it's too nasty, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Because there was one, I think, at like Thanksgiving they had to eat -- eat like -- like really old eggnog or something.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I remember.
R:  Remember that? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I remember that one. [LAUGH]
R:  God, it was gruesome.  Like I can't even watch it because it's making me gag just watching it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no.
R:  So, it's not a good thing at all.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.
R:  But ... [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  And, ah, what else this thing said?  What do we watch and why do we think it's so popular?
R:  Oh.  I know -- like -- I think like The Bachelor and Joe Millionaire is like -- you know, these girls are just so -- so petty, I mean, [LAUGH] you know?
L:  True.  True.
R:  And it's like you just are addicted.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words].  Um, basically I -- I think it's, um, popular because -- um, because they're real people it's real --
R:  Yup.
L:  -- events and you try to, you know, watch how people respond to each other really, basically.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know?  Um, [MN] usually if you're -- you're from -- have a family and you have squabbles and things like that, it's interesting to see how other people squabble.
R:  Yep.  Oh, like the Osborne's. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.
R:  The Osborne's are unbelievable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but you know, you can't not watch them when you [several inaudible words] or like what is it Anna Nicole's Nose Job?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I love to watch her because it's just -- she's just so out there.
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  You know?  It's like oh my God, that's a real person doing that.
L:  D- -- exactly.
R:  It's like that's -- that's not scripted, that is -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] your life.
L:  That's right.  Yeah, the celebrity ones are, ah, good too.  Um, I remember they had two of them but they went off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One with, um, MC Hammer and the, ah, little guy from Different Strokes and --
R:  Oh, yeah and what was it, Corey Haim or something?
L:  Y- -- right.
R:  Was that the one?
L:  Um -- well, I didn't get to watch the ending of what happened --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but um, yeah I kept up for a couple of weeks with that show.  Then they had another one, um, on, um, ABC.  Um, that was a short one for that [inaudible] celebrity one too.
R:  Hm.  Oh, that was the I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here or something?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah, I never watched that, it just didn't do anything for me.
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- they're -- they're very interesting to watch, really.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  To see people's personalities and how they deal with each other [several inaudible words].
R:  One I loved though was, um, the latest one, the one with the masks.
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh, what was that?
L:  Mm.
R:  Where the guys were all wearing -- wearing all the different masks.  I can't even think of the name.
L:  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  It -- it -- um, because you've gotta -- you don't know if he's ugly [LAUGH] or what.
R:  [inaudible].  That one, yes.  Exactly.
L:  I didn't get to watch that one yet, but it did look interesting.
R:  It was good, surprisingly.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because I wasn't sure.  I'm like, "Oh, Monica Lewinsky that's hosting it" but you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it was actually really good.  Because it's like, you know, she doesn't know these guys.  You know, I think that's what it is, like you just get so involved in them.
L:  Y- -- right.
R:  You know?  It's like, "Ooh, what would I do?" and then you're like, "Ooh, they can't pick him" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  Or pick her or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] And then -- you know, because you see all the behind -- behind the scenes stuff that you don't really see when you're like, you know, going through it.
L:  E- exactly. [NOISE]
R:  I think that's part of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Very interesting.  So, I'll -- I do admit, I do watch shows --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I can't keep away.  Every single one of them.
R:  Exactly.  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  You have to pick and choose.
L:  Yeah and I mean, there's so many just keeps coming out, you know?
R:  I know.  And then what is it?  American Idol I did like last year.
L:  [MN]
R:  I didn't like it this year.
L:  Uh-huh.  And I haven't even -- I only watched a few episodes of that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I just can't keep up with every- -- ah, I did watch Fame. [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible].  How was that?
L:  I like it.
R:  Really?
L:  I like it, it's interesting. [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  I like it.  You know?  So, I -- um, yeah, these shows are pretty good.
R:  Yeah.  For most of the kids though, it seems like the parents are just like pushing the kids into doing it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  That's true.  I mean, some of them have pure talent, you know that?
R:  Yep, exactly.
L:  But um --
R:  Yeah, but not every kid is like a little baby --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Britney Spears.
L:  E- exactly.
R:  You know?  Some of them, you know, I think know that they don't belong up there.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Definitely.  Um -- yeah, so these shows are really good --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  --  you know?  Um, I don't know what else they want us to, you know, elaborate on.
R:  [LAUGH] No idea.
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]  But um, definitely -- um, I hope to see some -- some good shows.  I just -- you know, even Cops every once in awhile I might watch that, you know?
R:  Yeah, that's not bad.  Or like, um -- oh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- okay, I -- I'm addicted to the Fox ones, because I watched, what was it, Married By America?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH] Did you see that one, it was on a couple of --
L:  I -- I never heard of that.
R:  These couples, um, they were interviewed separately and then their -- I guess it was the guys -- I -- I think it was a couple of guys and a couple of girls, they were um -- they're like three friends or siblings or parents got to choose who they were going to be married to.
L:  Oh, I think --
R:  That one --
L:  -- I remember what you -- yeah.  Yep, I --
R:  Two complete strangers.
L:  I saw a couple of episodes of those.
R:  Yep, that one was good.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  It was like, "Oh, my God".
L:  But I just never -- I never get to finish them because they come on and then -- then they go right back off [several inaudible words].
R:  Exactly.  Yeah, it's only like, you know, four or five weeks and then back on again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, if you miss one it's like, "What's going on?".
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  That was a good one, because neither couple ended up getting married at the end --
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  -- and if you -- if they got married they got like half a million dollars worth of prizes.  I'm like, "Just get married for the prizes".
L:  Oh! [LAUGH]
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, man.
R:  I'm like, "Hey, I would be up there getting married for the prizes when you know" you know?
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  It's like, "Hey".
L:  I -- I can't see what else they could come up with next, but hey.
R:  Well, that's what I thought until I saw the mask one.  And then there's like -- there's the new on, is it ABC, NBC, I don't know, one of [several inaudible words] --
L:  I know there's a new one -- um, the -- the girls are supposed to be going out with a guy for the money and he doesn't know it.
R:  Yup.  Yup, that one.
L:  And I said, "You know --"
R:  Yeah, if he picks them, they win like a million dollars or something.
L:  I said, "Oh, I ..." you know?  And I'm wondering at the end what -- how, you know, psychologically --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- you know, what does it d- do to the person?
R:  Exactly.
L:  And, you know, some -- some of them I do question.
R:  I know.
L:  Something like that I definitely question.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I watched the first one and I'm like, "This is too -- too weird" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Exactly.  So, I -- you know, if you don't want somebody to fall in love with somebody and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- at the end of the show, you're like, "Well, I just wanted to marry you for -- you know, I just wanted to be your girlfriend or be picked because -- for the money" you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It could really crush somebody that way.
R:  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  But I'm sitting there thinking, "Okay, he's a lawyer anyway, so, I mean, a million dollars really -- you know, if you were ma- married to her for like a lifetime --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know [LAUGH] a million dollars, that will -- he'll make a million dollars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- so" you know?
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  It's not that great, so you should just go for it -- for the, you know --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- make half.  Um, I don't know.
L:  Definitely.  Um [MN] -- yeah, so these shows are very interesting, ah --
R:  Yeah.  It's just like it's escape from, like, your normal life because these people are doing stuff that [several inaudible words] never, ever do.
L:  Th- -- ah, exactly --
R:  I --
L:  -- and see how other people live.
R:  Yeah.  What was that show?  Didn't Fox -- ah, I think Fox had it on, Fox has all the weird ones --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- about, um -- [several inaudible words] they were on like an island or something, the couples?
L:  Oh, I know -- yeah, I know what you're talking about, I don't remember the name of it, but --
