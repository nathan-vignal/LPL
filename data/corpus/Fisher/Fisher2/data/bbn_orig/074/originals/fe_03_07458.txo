R:  Nah.
L:  I don't really watch reality shows.  I think they're corny.
R:  Me neither. [MN] [MN] I think, no, well, yeah, the reality show -- it started out pretty good, like Survivor --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that first one.  'Cause it was something new and we didn't, ah, you know, we weren't familiar with anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or what was -- what was going to happen.  Then after a while --
L:  That was like the gateway.
R:  --yeah, then after a while everything started popping up.
L:  I know, now they got the dumbest shit like the people in the mask.
R:  Yeah, ah, ugly [MN] -- no, no, um, [MN] that's where the girl get married to the, ah --
L:  Yeah, the -- the girl gets to choose a guy but she can't see his face --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- but she gets to know his personal- -- and every week, like, she eliminates a certain few and she coulda wind up with, like, either a millionaire or she can wind up with a guy that don't even have a job.
R:  And the think is you -- I wonder if it's real.  They say reality but I wonder if it's real, you know.
L:  Me too.  I wonder if it's real too.
R:  Staged.
L:  It's staged, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you know what kind of reality shows I like?  I like, like, um, American Idol.
R:  Now, that's cool.
L:  That's -- that's like a real reality show --
R:  Yeah, becau- --
L:  -- and they got the new one, they got Thing[?].
R:  Yeah.

R:  The Thing?
L:  The Thing.  Thing, yeah.  It's with Patti LaBelle.
R:  Mm.  Oh, well, Debbie Allen must have produced it.
L:  Yeah, someth- -- maybe she has something to do with it.  I don't know.
R:  [MN]
L:  But I know definitely for sure that Patti LaBelle is, like, one of the hosts.
R:  Ahah.
L:  And, um, what's that other show called?  Now they got the one with the little -- with the young girl.
R:  Oh, y- -- um --
L:  With the young --
R:  Teenage Idol.
L:  Yeah, Teena --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- like American Idol, some shit like that.
R:  That's with the kids.
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  That's the one with --
L:  -- with the kids.
R:  -- the kids.  [MN]  Yeah, um, what are we going to say about that?  They got so many of them coming out.
L:  Yeah, they sure damn [inaudible] --
R:  They got another one coming out this year, um, like a Survivor thing.
L:  Another one?
R:  Yes. [MN] I mean, it's coming out every -- oh, no, no, no.  The American Idol.  They're coming out with a -- a different one.
L:  With the juniors?
R:  Y- -- no, it's a, um, universal thing.
L:  Oh, it's universal?
R:  Yeah.  You can be in England and --
L:  Can someone clean the swing for me? [NOISE] I was talking on the phone.  Leave me alone.  Um --
R:  You can be in England a- and participate. [MN]
L:  Yeah, that's cool though.
R:  But, like, the -- the voting.  On American Idol the voting sometimes gets really stupid.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Did you, um, watch it when, ah, what's his name?  [LIPSMACK] The big guy, the one that one it last.
L:  The, um, oh, I forgot his name.  Two O. five. 
R:  [MN]
L:  [NOISE] He always wore the jersey two O. five.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I know who you're talking about.
R:  Yeah and they -- they almost voted him off.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  One [MN] --
L:  But he was real good.  I liked that girl, the chubby girl.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  She had the, like, bluesy voice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The rhythm and blues.
R:  And, um, all of 'em were, um, going to be on [inaudible].
L:  All of 'em what?
R:  They're gonna come to, um, [LIPSMACK] this -- what is it?  First Union.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're gonna have a, um, show [LIPSMACK] next month.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  All of 'em done did albums and the first two that -- no the last two that, ah, play and Reuben, that's the name.
L:  Reuben, that's his name.
R:  Yeah.  They already set up a contract.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, uh-uh.
R:  Huh?
L:  But, um, [LIPSMACK] yeah, I like shows like -- like the reality shows like that [LIPSMACK] but I don't like Survivor, like, I wasn't really too much into Survivor, like, there was other ones.  You know what shows I like?  I like The Real World, like on [MN] M- MTV.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's reality shows too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I'm going in [inaudible].  Yeah, that's reality.
R:  Yeah, that was pretty good.  They come out with so much now it's -- nobody's gonna be watching it as [MN] they used to.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  I think people like to watch them because it's unpredictable, like, it's not something set that's supposed to happen.  It's something that happens while you're watching.
R:  Yeah, but you know what --
L:  But, really, it's not really reality because I think it's prerecorded. 
R:  [MN]
L:  I think it if was live --
R:  Oh, yeah, American Idol I think is.
L:  Yeah, I think if it was live --
R:  'Cause it comes on, like, two times, three times a -- a week.
L:  Yeah, if it was really live --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Everyone's talking.
R:  [MN] What have you been saying?  Are you eating?
L:  Who, me?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I was lighting a cigarette.
R:  Oh, I'm eating.
L:  'Cause I'm drinking a little something tonight.
R:  Oh, good, that's what's up.
L:  That's what's up.  I'm drinking the raspberry bacardi.  Oh, we're not supposed to talk about that, right?
R:  I don't know, first time.
L:  I don't know either.
R:  This is my first time on.
L:  Me too.  This is my first time.  You know what?  Actually my husband got me into this.  He told me about it because somebody from the chat line -- you call the chat line?
R:  No.
L:  Well, somebody from the chat line gave me the -- gave him the number and he told me about it.  But then --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- he was expecting the call yesterday but now today's his birthday and he went out --
R:  Ahah.
L:  -- so, now, I got to talk on the phone.
R:  [MN]
L:  It's crazy.
R:  They called me first and they said, ah, what d- -- no, [MN] I heard -- I heard it on the radio.
L:  You heard it on the radio?
R:  Yeah.  And I thought [several inaudible words] down check it out.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, they said they would be calling me tomorrow.  I was, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- totally shocked they were doing it so quick.
L:  Really.
R:  Anyway -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- how much time do you think we done did? [MN]
L:  I don't know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, anyway, I got more to say on reality shows.  I think they're all right.  But I don't like the stupid ones like Survivor and, like, that Bachelor shit.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's boring.  I like, um, like Real World.
R:  I think they just getting that for the money.  It's not like --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- um, like you say, the Idol -- American Idol.  They're gonna get --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, a lot more.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder if Fear Factor is considered reality.  You think?
R:  No.
L:  Because I love that show.
R:  No, because you already know the contestants and what -- what -- what they gotta do.
L:  Yeah, but they're real people, aren't they?
R:  Yeah, but, is -- [MN] hm.
L:  It's more or less a game, you think?
R:  I think that's a game.
L:  You think?
R:  'Cause they -- they're contestants, ah, competing, more so compet- --
L:  More competitive, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But Survivor was a competitive game too and it was considered realit- --
R:  I heard that got kinda outrageous 'cause that -- they have some real, ah, what they call hardship against each other.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, they had a lotta -- you go -- but it was -- it was like -- it was comp- competitive, that was the word I was looking for.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was definitely competitive, I think.
R:  [MN] But the, ah, what's the name?  The guy that, ah -- I like -- y- -- I'm still on American Idol because I like the guy, what's the name, that was voting?  You know, the guy that was one of the judges, ah, like, ah, ah, what's his name?  He always had something hard to say to -- to the -- to the contestants.
L:  Yeah, who, Simon?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Is that --
R:  He said he's not gonna be on next year.
L:  I hope he is.
R:  No, he said he -- he ha- -- he's going back to his, um, [LIPSMACK] -- he has a recording company.
L:  How about that Paula Abdul?  Ain't she banging?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, she's real fine.
R:  Always was my baby.
L:  Yeah, Paula Abdul. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I remember when she used to sing for real.
R:  Yeah, she was the, um, Lakers, ah --
L:  The cheerleader.
R:  -- cheers coordinator.
L:  Yeah, something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Oh --
L:  That's cool.  She's banging though.  She's [several inaudible words].
R:  She got married, didn't she?
L:  I don't know if she got married.
R:  I remember she was supposed to marry --
L:  I think her and Simon got a thing going.
R:  [MN] Could be.
L:  I really do.
R:  Could be.
L:  You don't think?
R:  At first I didn't like him but now I kinda like him.
L:  Who, Simon?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, he -- you gotta like him because he's so real, like.  
R:  And when --
L:  You gotta appreciate that in a person.
R:  Yeah, and like I was saying when they had, um, ah, Reuben --
L:  Ahah.
R:  -- and they -- they had him down -- he had to go down and prove himself.  He said, "I can't believe this".
L:  Yeah.
R:  He said, "All of you across America must be stupid".
L:  Isn't that crazy?
R:  [MN]
L:  That is crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I didn't really -- I don't keep up on TV, like, because I play video games, I'm a mother of two under two years old --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I don't really watch TV so much but when I get the chance I'm watching my soap operas.  I don't even --
R:  I'm into movies.
L:  You're in the movies?
R:  Yeah, I like the movies.  I -- or I'm watching cable.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I -- I'm, like, watching cable shows.
L:  I have cable too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have cable.  That's [inaudible] expensive.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's some real TV right there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Fucking expensive as cable.
R:  And you know what?  You don't see too many shows on there.  I mean, like --
L:  No, for what you pay for.  Hell, no.
R:  Well, I'm talking about, like, reality shows.  
L:  No.
R:  You don't see them on there.
L:  You really don't.
R:  They don't wanna waste no money on it.
L:  Hell, no.  That's what it is.  It's a lotta money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then the prize is always, like, a million dollars.
R:  Yeah, but I wonder what's up with that. [MN]
L:  I know.  And they talk about they ain't got no money, they ain't got no money.  We need to put into the community but they go giving fucking thousand dollars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- away.  Like, this, the lottery too.
R:  [MN]
L:  How does the government have all that money to give to somebody who spends a dollar and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- giving them a whole bunch of money like that?
R:  Ah, that's, you know --
L:  That is some shit.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because you know how much money they make off of people, off the losers?
R:  [MN]
L:  You into lottery?
R:  Oh, dear, that's a lot of money.
L:  Hell, yeah.  You into the lottery?
R:  Nah.
L:  No, that's real TV too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That sure is.
R:  [LAUGH] See, that's r- --
L:  What are you laughing for?  It sure --
R:  That's real --
L:  -- is real TV.
R:  -- that's real.  Yeah, it is.
L:  That's real TV.
R:  It is, when your money gets taken.  That is real.
L:  Hell, yeah.  That is real when your money gets taken away from you.  You see that last number's a two and you wanted it to be a--
R:  [MN]
L:  -- six.  You be like, "What!"
R:  That's right.  That's reality.
L:  That is reality.  That should bring you real quick to reality.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Sure, you right.  Sure, you right.  That's real reality.
L:  Ah, that's funny, right?
R:  Damn. [MN]
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  Oh, yeah, you know what?  They got a, um, show called it, L- -- The Lottery.
L:  Do they?
R:  Yeah.  I saw --
L:  You gotta be kidding me.
R:  -- it after the news one night.
L:  [NOISE] Why is Aisling[?] crying like that?  [NOISE] Yes, she is.  I hear her.
R:  [MN]
L:  Oh, God.
R:  I don't know how much time. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- neither do I.  I don't know how much time.  We gotta do this for three hours?
R:  Huh?
L:  We gotta do this for three hours?
R:  No, ten minutes.
L:  That's it?
R:  Yeah.

R:  Each call is ten minutes.
L:  That's it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then after ten minutes your ten minutes is up?
R:  Yeah.

R:  No.
