R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, how are ya?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.
L:  [LAUGH] Who's this and where you from?
R:  I'm Joanne and I live in Indiana.
L:  Oh, I'm from -- Tim and I'm from about the middle of the state, Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh!
L:  [LAUGH] How are you?
R:  I'm real good.
L:  Oh.  So today's holidays, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  What's your favorite?
R:  Christmas.
L:  Really?  How --
R:  Yes.
L:  Why?
R:  [SIGH] I just -- I just love the whole session of December.  I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I love when you go Christmas shopping and, um, they're playing carols and I love -- you know, people seem so much nicer, the salespeople --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- everybody just seems, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- just so much nicer.  I don't know, it --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just a fun season, I really love it.
L:  Yeah, it definitely is.  Uh, I would -- I would probably say it's -- it's in my top couple of 'em.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So what's your favorite?
L:  Oh, jeeze.  I'm going to go with a split tie between the fourth of July and Halloween.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I like the fourth of July but I'd have to say Halloween's probably my least favorite.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  I -- yeah, I just don't like it.
L:  Oh.  I like it, I think it's a fun holiday, it's -- when I was in high school I would throw Halloween parties and -- and just a couple of my closest guy friends and they'd just come over and I would actually tell my mom to postpone my birthday --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- which is May --
R:  Uh.
L:  -- and I'd say, "I don't want a birthday party, I want a Halloween party this year" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, you know, we'd get together, about five of us and we had -- where I grew up we had an enclosed patio with a fireplace in it and we'd have a fire and make sandwiches and just si- -- you know, just sit around and talk about what high school guys talk about I guess.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Or things that we didn't talk about, I don't know, just had a blast and that's one of my biggest memories is just Halloween parties and good friends and everything.  And fourth of July I've always liked, just -- just the fireworks and being in the middle of the summer and no matter if you're working or not you usually get at least half a day off and [SIGH] I don't know, I guess I'm American. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  So I have to like that one.
R:  Well, I like fourth of July.  We live, um -- where we live, we live on a -- a -- a -- a lake, it's a good sized lake and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so every fourth of July, well actually they do it on the Saturday so this year it'll be the fifth, we --
L:  Mhm.
R:  They shoot fireworks over the lake.
L:  Oh.
R:  So everybody gets out in their boats and their pontoons and I mean there's hundreds, you know, and goes out in the lake and watches them.  So we always have a cookout with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, our friends bring pontoons over and it's just a lot of fun.  We just have a big day and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, eat and go out on the boats and then watch the fireworks, come back and sit by a campfire and that's always a lot of fun here.
L:  Oh, it sounds really cool.  Yeah, I try to have a cookout whenever I can.  I remember last year I worked for the fourth and -- but I work, uh, somewhat retail so I -- I was open for a little bit but it was a nice easy day and by the time I got home it was about six or seven o'clock and just a nice evening and everything and, um -- well, I live in sleepy little town called Lock Haven and, uh, there's -- it's right on the Susquehanna River and, um, I don't know if they did it on the fourth or somewhere around there but I think we went for a walk that night anyway just to see if they'd do the fireworks over the river.  Nothing too big, like I said, it's a small town so there's nothing too huge --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, uh, uh, where I work is, uh, State College, Pennsylvania, home of, uh, Penn State University --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and they always have a big show.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I didn't get to see it last year, tried to get my butt out of town --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- before the crowds came in [LAUGH] but, uh --
R:  Have you ever seen the fireworks at Disneyworld?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Oh, you know, they have 'em every night and I've seen --
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're just gor- -- they're just awesome.
L:  Hm.
R:  You know, they are -- they're -- they're just wonderful, they really, really are.
L:  Yeah, I was -- I was there, uh, well, my senior year of high school, in fact, going back to high school, um, for a band trip.  We were there for three days and we got to explore all the parks and all the -- only our obligation was to, uh, actually have a little parade in the middle of Disney and we performed and everything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so that was a -- a bit of a treat.
R:  Our high school band does that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- once in a while.  They -- I think that's neat.  They do that.
L:  It was definitely a cool senior trip, I have to tell ya. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, see I grew up in California --
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  -- so I grew up at Disneyland.
L:  Mm.
R:  So I'm kinda partial to that and we used to go to gr- -- Disneyland for grad night and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all sorts of stuff.
L:  Wow.  Ah, not around here. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Not too much.  I guess there's different places.  There's Kennywood in Pittsburgh and different things like that but, uh, nah, nothing too much, nice sleepy little town. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So did you have a -- are you father?  Did you have a nice Fathers' Day?
L:  Nope, [SIGH] um, I'm not a father.
R:  You're not a father?
L:  Not quite yet.
R:  Well, you have a father don't you?
L:  Yes, I do --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I -- and I got to call him today and he was all -- he was very happy that I did.
R:  Yeah, I called my dad, too.  My dad's in Florida.
L:  Oh, yeah?  I called him and, uh, he's -- oh, I'm not quite a father yet although my fiancee, uh, is kinda pushing for it.  I'm only twenty four and she's twenty five and we're getting married next September and --
R:  Oh, how neat.
L:  -- I'll be a father some day soon.
R:  Yeah, well my son is twenty four, my youngest son.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  He graduated from college, uh, not this year, last year as a teacher.  Unfortunately he didn't find a teaching job.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And he still hasn't found one yet and I just -- he called today 'cause he couldn't get home.  He's living in Indy right now.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  We live in northern Indiana.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, he's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  He's really quite discouraged, you know, and it's like [LAUGH] you know, I mean, he's --
L:  I'm laughing because I really, really, really identify with that.  I graduated last May with a teaching degree --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with -- in social studies and --
R:  That's [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's like, goodness, you know, if we could go back and do it over again, huh?
L:  Oh, my goodness --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's so hard.
R:  So now he's working for, like, ten something an hour, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's, like, okay starting to pay back student loans and --
L:  Yep.
R:  And all this stuff and it -- it's really been rough, you know, he's, uh --
L:  Same boat, yep.
R:  He's discouraged and he says if I don't get one -- of course, last year he didn't apply like he should of.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think this youthful enthusiasm, he just applied at schools he thought he wanted --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I, uh -- same thing.
R:  -- and this year he's really applied but Indiana is bad.  They've cut -- they're cutting teachers and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- all this stuff but, um -- and then he -- he -- he runs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so he does cross country and track --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so he'd love to do coaching in that.
L:  Mm. [NOISE]
R:  But that does not seem to be the field to be in to.
L:  Oh [SIGH] I guess not.  Everything here seems to be dual certification nowadays and --
R:  Yes, that's what he said, too.
L:  Oh my, Pennsylvania's been flooded with teachers and -- and there's just nothing and I went to little -- Lock Haven University's supposed to be the best teaching school on the eastern seaboard --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, it was a nice place, great education but no jobs, what do you know, I --
R:  Huh.  So, have you given up then?
L:  I haven't completely given up --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but I don't know what I want to do.  Right now, I'm -- I've -- I -- I've always done art all my life and right now I work in a Michael's Arts and Crafts as a framer and --
R:  Oh, I love Michael's.
L:  -- it's a great job and everything.  Oh yeah, me, too. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Course I get paid to say that but ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's -- in fact, uh, speaking of fourth of July that actually is, uh, bugging me because I worked it last year and I don't know if they're going to make me work this year and --
R:  Yeah, now do you guys have a Hobby Lobby?
L:  Hm, pardon me?
R:  Hobby Lobby?
L:  No, what's that?
R:  Oh, that's a -- that's a store like Michael's.  I was going to say they're closed on Sundays.
L:  Hm, lucky them.
R:  It's a huge store.  It reminds you a lot of Michael's, you know --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- same prices, I mean, real good stuff like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Huh, that's just -- yeah, you know, and -- and they tell you not to go back to school to get your master's until you get a job.
L:  Huh!
R:  So, you know, you don't want to do that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I don't know, I just -- I keep -- I just pray that -- that they put him where he should be, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know, you know.
L:  Yep, well --
R:  He just gets discouraged and, like I said, so hopefully something will come up but -- and he's got a girlfriend [LAUGH]. He would be engaged except the poor kid can't afford --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- an engagement ring, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They've gone together --
L:  Oh, I went with the payment plan on that one. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, they've gone together about four -- oh, probably four years now --
L:  Oh, same as me.
R:  -- and I know they'd like to get married.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, she's a graphic designer.  It took her two years to get a job in her field.
L:  Mm, wow.
R:  You know, and she's still not quite where she wants to be but it's okay, she's getting experience, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Anyway --
L:  Yeah, it's all about, you know, what you like.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I believe totally that if you're happy with what you're doing, [SIGH] you know, as long as you're living happy that's [SIGH] -- that's the main part.
R:  Well, that's true, that's true.
L:  Yes.  And for our mom's worries, it's -- it's probably best that -- to hear from your son or daughter that they're happy.
R:  Right, right.
L:  You know, 'cause you come -- you come to this age and you finally look back and say, "Boy, I was nasty when I was young".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Then all of a sudden you're mom's favorite again --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and dad's favorite because you're the good one. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, it happens. [COUGH] No, but I'm sure he'll -- he'll find something someday and so will I --
R:  I hope so, you know.
L:  -- whatever it will be.
R:  They keep saying there's going to be a teacher shortage.  I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I wish they would pay -- I work at a school as a teaching assistant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I just wish that they would pay some of -- you know, offer these teachers bonuses to retire early.
L:  Oh yeah, they're actually -- in Pennsylvania the new Governor is pushing for a thirty and out rule --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which would eliminate a whole lot of teachers.
R:  Well, and -- if -- when you think about it, they'd save so much money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by paying a teacher that's been there twenty five years and paying somebody like, you know -- uh, somebody like you just coming in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, they would save a fortune so --
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  -- I don't know what they're going to do.
L:  We'll hope.
R:  Yep.
L:  It would be a great job. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it would be.  Now, would you rather teach high school or middle school?
L:  High school.
R:  That's what he would but he'd -- he'd do middle school.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But he'd rather do high school.
L:  I would.  I had a class of eighth grade when I did student teaching but, uh --
R:  So did he. [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh my god.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Whew!
R:  Well, see I work at an elementary middle school and, yeah, eight --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, middle school, there's too many hormones going.
L:  Oh, my god.
R:  You know. [LAUGH]
L:  Hormones or sneakers.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's what we call 'em. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's like no --
