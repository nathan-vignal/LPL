R:  I have.
L:  Oh, really?  How long d- did it take?  [NOISE]

R:  So, I already got one check.
L:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Oh, well.  Okay.  [NOISE]  So, I guess [NOISE] we're supposed to t- talk about, um, --
R:  Your favorite holiday.
L:  -- holidays.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  So, [SIGH] I guess I'm kind of -- I ... kind of like b- both Christmas and Halloween.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]  I was going to say I like Christmas.  I like the whole aspect of [SIGH] s- shopping.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Shopping's always --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- good with me.
L:  Yeah.  Well, that's cool.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I like going out and seeing all the, um, you know, all the [SIGH] Christmas decorations and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [MN] 'cause, um, [SIGH] I guess it with my -- like family or whatever.
R:  Y- yeah.  It's nice.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Where are you at right now?
L:  Um, I'm in California in a --
R:  Where?
L:  Santa Cruz, California.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm ... down in LA.
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  So, it's not too far.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  But, ah, so --
R:  How --
L:  -- do you usually get together with your family or ...?
R:  [SIGH]  U- um, most likely my family all within t- the s- same area.
L:  Oh!  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, we usually celebrate and, you know, get to see everybody and [SIGH] some good times.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  And then, [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- y- you know, it's good but, you know, I -- for the most part I see them all the time anyways.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a little different when ... you don't have people around.
L:  Yeah, a whole lot.
R:  [NOISE]  You know, and then you're like, "O- oh, you know" but [SIGH] I get to see them ... all the time.  So, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not a huge, huge difference but it's cool.
L:  Y- yeah, my family's ... out of state so --
R:  Oh, where are they at?
L:  Um, in Texas actually.  So, ...
R:  Oh, in Texas?
L:  Yes, so I usually go down for, -- ah, usually just Christmas.  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh!  Do you -- so you don't see them very often then?
L:  A- ah, not too much.  Sometimes they [NOISE] come and visit [NOISE] here.  So, ...  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, okay.  Do you go over there a lot?
L:  U- um, [NOISE] mostly ... once or maybe twice a year, because it's far.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [SIGH]  But, yeah, I've been here for like, [SIGH] ... ah, about twelve years or something so ...
R:  Really?  So, what brought you out here?
L:  [SIGH]  Um, just kind of school and stuff.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But, um, [NOISE] --
R:  Are you -- you [inaudible].  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, no, no, he's at school in San Francisco.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um, [NOISE] but anyway so they also mentioned, ah, something about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if you could invent a h- holiday [LAUGH] or something.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  So, I just --
R:  And do you know of any current event[?] on?
L:  Yeah, and I don't think, um, [LIPSMACK] -- um, of --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I can't think of anything really [LAUGH] that I would --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I just like, like the -- the Halloween [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] just 'cause of the -- the whole
R:  [MN]
L:  -- decorations and --
R:  Uh-hum.  [MN]  [NOISE]
L:  -- kind of -- type of thing.
R:  Well, I think everyone has -- should have their own holiday and that should be their birthday.  They should get the day off for their birthday.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that would be ... the thing I would really like to see.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, [SIGH] I think that would be nice, everyone get their birthday off.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, [NOISE] that would be cool.
R:  That would be the h- holiday that I'd say, yes, to.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]  Other than that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  That's what I kind of like ... my birthdays off.
R:  Huh?  [NOISE]
L:  My birthday's in October so [NOISE] that's kind of why -- why I like --
R:  Oh!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That'd be nice.  [SIGH]  It's Halloween?
L:  Y- yeah.  It's kind of ... my favorite time of the year.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  It is.
R:  Really?
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Right.
R:  The weather and all that.
L:  Well, [NOISE] I mean it's [NOISE] -- up here it's not too bad in the summer time.  [NOISE]  Um, but I kind of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:   -- Fall too.  S- so, ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  But, um, --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- I mean I think there's more holidays actually than in the Fall and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and the winter months.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.
L:  [NOISE]  But, um, [PAUSE] [MN] so ... [SIGH] so what's -- I guess would be your second [LAUGH] f- favorite holiday?  [SIGH]  'Cause I --
R:  I don't know, actually.
L:  [NOISE]  Well, what is there?  There's, um, [MN] Halloween, Thanksgiving ...  [NOISE]
R:  Mm, New Years.  [LAUGH]
L:  And New Years, yeah, I guess [LAUGH] that could be one to consider.
R:  Really fun.
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.
L:  You know, --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- my boyfriend's birth -- boyfriend's birthday --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is on New Year's Eve.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, is it?
L:  So, that's cool.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  And my sister -- my sister's is on ... Christmas Eve.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's kind of a holiday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well [NOISE] I like Fourth of July.  [LAUGH]
L:  Your birthday is Fourth of July?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is that what you said?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, I'm going out or something.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Well, [NOISE] --
L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, hello.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  Can you hear me now?
L:  Y- yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm on a cellphone so ...  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, yes, so am I.  So, ...
R:  Oh, are you also?
L:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Which is a l- little difficult.
L:  Yeah, and I'm surprised 'cause I usually g- get called --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] like on -- at nighttime.  I usually don't get called on Sundays.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  So, it's kind of strange I think.  [inaudible]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Do they always call you late?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] I got a call like at ten forty five or something once.
R:  At n- night?
L:  Or -- well, maybe ten but --
R:  Oh, I always get it around this time.  [SIGH]
L:  So, I guess --
R:  Well, I think I --
L:  Where --
R:  -- put it down like I only w- wanted it round this time.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, so they call me round this time and I'm just like, "Oh, okay".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, but mostly it's like Sundays and I'll just [inaudible] Sunday.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  --
R:  And I [inaudible]
L:  [SIGH] So, what do you usually, um --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Do you usually do like a lot of holidays -- like, pre holiday stuff, like a whole December just like --
R:  Yeah, I like to put up my decorations of course.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely, [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  [inaudible]
L:  But you have your own house or apartment?
R:  It's [inaudible]
L:  Excuse me?  Oh, I think I'm unplugged.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  Hello?  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Okay.  You go.
R:  I just lost you for a little while.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I don't know if it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know if it's me or you.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  I can't tell either.  [SIGH]  When it's software you never know.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]  Which company are you with?
L:  Oh, Brandon[?].
R:  I'm with them too.
L:  Oh!  [MN]  Yeah, sometimes the -- the reception isn't too good depending on what's up.  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  It's kind of strange though --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because I might just be sitting around [SIGH] and it'll be good at one minute and the next minute it wouldn't.  It's not like I'm moving but --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that's how it is.  [SIGH]  Do you decorate?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  U- um, yeah, well let's see, the last couple of years I didn't.  Well, yeah, it depends how hectic it is 'cause I go to Texas --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so I --
R:  [NOISE]  That's good.
L:  -- too busy then it's like I don't really [LAUGH] decorate because I'll be gone but ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [NOISE]  Yeah, --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- I have like a bunch of decorations and stuff.  So, I just ...
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  I've done it.  A- and --
R:  Well, that's cool.
L:  -- actually, yeah, that's true.  You said something about July Fourth or you were saying something about July Fourth.
R:  Yeah, July Fourth's another fun holiday.
L:  Yeah, it's not?  [LAUGH]
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  Why do you --
R:  As a matter of fact.  [SIGH]  I like the fireworks.  [LAUGH]
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  Yeah, my boyfriend l- loves fireworks.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  He's a pyro.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  So, that's just fun.
L:  [SIGH]  Yeah, I'm not sure if we should talk about that [LAUGH] t- too much but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  T- true.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But, ah, [LAUGH] --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- yeah, we -- [SIGH] we get some pretty good fireworks.
R:  Yeah, we were just in Mexico and bought some little tiny fireworks to play with.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  [SIGH]  That's fun.
L:  So, ...
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you just go to -- you go to the beaches down there?  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, we
R:  [SIGH]  Always nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, it's always cool.
L:  -- we'll just go and, like, shoot off all their old fireworks and [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it's kind of nice 'cause most of --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- their sittings[?] are done on beaches.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's really ... good.  You get kicked off but the cops want everybody --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- on the beaches for that o- one n- n- night.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  But, um --
R:  Not get into trouble.
L:  So, that's kind of cool.  And -- and I think --
R:  Yeah, I do think --
L:  -- it's good to have your own.  There's so much o- other stuff going off too so --
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so it's just like a whole -- it's like a little show in itself.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's cool 'cause -- and it's warm.
L:  Y- yeah, up here it's --
R:  It's usually warm and it --
L:  -- up here [LAUGH] it's not.  It's just [inaudible] --
R:  I know up there --
L:  -- sometimes.
R:  -- it's usually always kind of, like, overcast isn't it?
