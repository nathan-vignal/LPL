R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Janice.
R:  Janice, my name is Lyn.
L:  Hi, Lyn.
R:  Where are you?
L:  I live in Austin, Texas.
R:  Austin, Texas.
L:  Mhm.  Where are you?
R:  I'm in Salem, Oregon.
L:  Salem, Oregon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  One of my favorite states.
R:  Pretty nice up here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I know Texas is very hot.
L:  Yes, it is.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, how did you find out about this, Janet?
L:  This, uh, program?  The -- the -- the, uh -- the, uh, survey that we're in?
R:  Yes, the survey.
L:  Yeah.  Um, through, uh -- on the Internet through, um, a shopping service that I participate in.
R:  Which one is that?
L:  Um ...
R:  Which one?
L:  I can't even remember of it.
R:  Is it Refunding Makes Sense?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  No.  The -- there's a lady named Wendy and Angela that send information to us about all kinds of stuff --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and I don't even remember the name of their company.
R:  Okay.
L:  But that's --
R:  All right.
L:  -- what I participate in.
R:  So, I guess we're supposed to talk about this for eight minutes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH] Um, what is your opinion about which is worse?
L:  Well, um, I heard him say gossiping, not exercising --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I couldn't hear all of them.
R:  Drinking.
L:  Drinking.
R:  Smoking.
L:  Smoking.
R:  Overeating or talking excessively.
L:  Oh, man!  And we have to pick one of those?  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, uh, you -- you just have to talk to -- about it, what you think is worse.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, some people think that gossiping is worse because those other things mainly affect yourself.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But maybe smoking is, uh -- affects other people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but like not exercising that's really a personal thing and, um, overeating that would be -- you know, you're only hurting yourself.  [LIPSMACK] Uh, talking excessively I think that that can be pretty annoying when people, um, just start talking and they're not checking to see if you're interested in the topic or if you're too busy to -- to listen to them.  I -- I think that, uh -- that kinda bugs me when people do that to me, um, and gossiping a lotta people gossip and it, uh -- it hurts other people.  Uh, I met somebody who doesn't -- who really doesn't gossip at all and I -- I think it's a very nice quality that she has.
L:  [MN] I think I'd narrow it down to gossiping and, um -- I don't know -- smoking because of the damage to your body.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or drinking.  I don't know, um ...
R:  You think that smoking, uh, and, uh -- and -- or drinking is the worst?
L:  Well, um, actually as I think about it theoretically you could drink like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a s- small amount that wouldn't be so damaging to your body or like not drive and drink.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But if you smoke it's for sure gonna [LAUGH] bother your body.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Even, you know, just a small amount of cigarette.  But I don't know.  I kinda think maybe gossiping is worse because of the damage that it does to people -- other people --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then your own self I guess.  If you live in that kinda world, um, it's got to be damaging to your own self if you --
R:  I think so because --
L:  -- if you do the gossiping.
R:  -- because [COUGH] if you gossip about -- if -- if you're -- if you do a lotta gossiping then you know that in -- in your circle you know that other people are gossiping about you and people are gossiping and it -- it's -- it's, uh, a very negative thing and it hurts -- and I think that if you gossip, uh -- I knew somebody who gossiped a lot but he didn't like being gossiped about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But he gossiped -- he -- he was always giving, uh, his opinion about other people and how bad they were and -- but he really hated it when he found out that people were doing that about him, talking to h- -- about him like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But yet he was always doing it.  So, I think a good way is not to do it, like if you can establish that with your -- in your circle of friends where people just don't do that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a lotta people that that's not really possible but, uh, that's what people do, they gossip.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I think it's -- I've heard that the best people talk about, um, issues and the worst people talk about each other in -- in a negative way.
L:  Mhm.  Have ...?
R:  I think that's probably true.
L:  Have you ever had, um, gossip affect you in some life changing way?
R:  Um, yeah.  Have you?
L:  Yes.
R:  It can -- it can really, uh -- you know, people are -- have different opinions about different things and when -- when -- you know, a lotta gossip isn't -- isn't necessarily true and, um [LIPSMACK], it can cause a lotta damage.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What happened to you?
L:  Um, well, actually to my husband.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, he was a pastor of a church --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK], the gossip mongers got going with a bunch of incorrect stuff mainly about financial matters in the church, which were not true --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, as a result he left.  It was after we left that, um [LIPSMACK] -- that they found out that wh- -- what was being said was not true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But by then the damage had been done.
R:  Did he, uh, get into different work?
L:  Ultimately, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  That's sad when, um, stuff like that happens.
L:  Yeah.  It was a pretty painful time, um, in our lives when -- when we knew that it wasn't true.
R:  I think people should, uh, be able to do whatever they wanna do as long as it doesn't hurt other people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  No matter what it is because I think the problem we have in the -- with the Arabs, for example, and the -- and the terrorists is because they think that their way is right and --
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R:  -- and most of these -- most of the, uh, Western religion think that their way is right and everybody else is wrong --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, they -- and people -- th- those kind of, uh, people tend to try to enforce their ideas on other people, um, as if whatever ideas they have, that they were brought up with, are the correct, right way and everybody else is wrong and there's -- there's like three hundred religions in the world and -- and if all of 'em think that, uh, their way is right and then -- and -- and -- and they're extremist about it then they could, um, uh -- I think that's -- that's where this terrorist thing came from because those people they really think that they're right and the Jews are wrong, the Christians are wrong, everybody else is wrong and their way is right and they'd rather see you dead th- than, uh, uh, have a different way of -- of life.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What do y- -- does -- does that make sense?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I agree.
R:  So, I think if -- if the world could learn one thing from that it would be -- from this terrorism thing it would be that we m- -- we should be more tolerant of each others', uh --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- ideas and ways of being and -- and quit acting like, uh, uh, we have the only line with God --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that our way is the -- is the right way, uh, according to God and, uh, nobody else's way could possibly be right 'cause that's how -- that's what those Arabs are, uh -- are -- are the ones that -- the terrorists and those people that's -- that's where they -- their position is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's, uh -- you could call it fundamentalism, uh -- fundamentalist extremism.
L:  Mhm.  You know, um, I was thinking about, um, when they first came on the phone and said today's topic was gonna be about personal habits --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I never thought about gossiping being a personal habit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, I mean, the other things -- smoking, drinking, overeating, exercising -- those really are personal -- in my mind, personal habits.  But I never thought about gossiping being a personal habit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a habit.
R:  Yeah.  But it is, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  But, I mean [NOISE], I'm -- I'm thinking about that now, which -- but I'd never considered it being a -- I thought about it more of a personality trait rather than a personal habit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hm.
R:  Do you, um -- do you gossip yourself?
L:  Oh, I'm -- I'm sure I do --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- from time to time, you know, talk ...
R:  I know somebody who really doesn't.  She really holds herself back from that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's a very beautiful quality.
L:  That is good.
R:  And, uh, if you ask her about -- or if you say something about somebody else and -- and invite her to give a negative opinion about that person or what they do she, uh, holds herself back from doing that, um ...
L:  That's wonderful.
R:  Mhm.  That's a very nice quality --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that I have, uh, admired in her and I try to be more like that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as opposed to the people that just can't to judge other people and talk about them in a negative way.
