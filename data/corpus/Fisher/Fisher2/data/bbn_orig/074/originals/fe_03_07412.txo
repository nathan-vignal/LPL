L:  Hello.  This is Carla.
R:  Hello, Carla.  This is, um, Masarta[?] and, uh, I'm in Washington in Seattle.
L:  Are you?  I am too.
R:  In Seattle, in the same city.  Wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  Your name is Masarta?
R:  Yeah.  And, um ...
L:  So, what do you think is the worst thing on the list?
R:  The worst thing on the list.  Actually I didn't understand it very good.  I mean, um, do we only talk about the worst thing or -- or about, uh, habits in general?
L:  Bad habits I think.
R:  About bad habits.  Okay.
L:  Bad habits.
R:  Um, I think ...
L:  Gossiping, smoking.  What?
R:  Um, smoking.  What else is there on the list?
L:  Smoking is on the list.
R:  Yeah.  I think smoking is the worst because I do smoke [LAUGH] and ...
L:  I think it's the worst because I work in cancer research.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  You -- it's more obvious for you.  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, uh, you are right.  Um, I don't know if, uh -- I -- I don't remember all the list but, um, smoking is very common and, um, it's also very common where I come from.  I come from, um, Turkey.  I'm half Turkish, half German.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, it is very, very common there.  It's, uh, not so common in the United States, like I guess fifteen or twenty percent of the people smoke here but, uh, it is about seventy or eighty percent back in Turkey --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and ...
L:  Well, you always hear about Turkish tobacco.  It's supposed to be so fine.
R:  Yeah.  There's -- there's so much Turkish tobacco.  So, they --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the people all -- and there's so much depression.  So, people all they do is smoking and, uh, that's -- that's ...
L:  That makes them feel good.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You, uh -- if -- if all your friends and family smoke then you smoke too and ...
L:  Um, that's true.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My -- my kids -- I have -- my children are in their twenties and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they smoke and their friends smoke.
R:  Do they?
L:  You know, I think it's more that age group it seems like.
R:  Yeah.  Um, American people, uh, are very successful in quitting smoking in the past ten years I believe.  Did you ever smoke?
L:  No.  I tried it and I didn't like it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Uh, that's good for you that you ...
L:  You know, I tried it in college like everybody --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I just didn't like it.  But, no ...
R:  I see.
L:  I know people who liked it the first time they tried it.  So ...
R:  I -- I didn't like it either.  I was born in Germany and, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they +taught very well that it is not a good habit to smoke and I was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- very much, uh, against smoking.  But now, um, later when we moved to Turkey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, uh, as I told you, all the people there are smoking and when they -- on one occasion you begin smoking.  So, you should, uh, uh, know better, uh, the consequences of smoking by -- by -- because you're working in cancer research.
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And one of the things we're trying to do is educate young people not to start because they find out it's a lot easier not to start than it is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to quit --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, uh ...
R:  I -- I heard in -- somewhere that, uh, eighty percent of the people who are successful to quit, quit because they have to.  It's because of an illness and the doctors --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- says you have to.  So, they take it serious.  But only twenty percent of -- of the people are consciously, um, doing it.
L:  Well, and I think that, you know, the reason I consider it a bad habit is of course its -- it's bad for the person who smokes --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but it's also something that intrudes on other people.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's not like --
R:  There's secondhand smoke.
L:  -- you're just sitting there drinking or something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where you're only hurting yourself --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of course, unless you're driving a car.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, when you smoke, you know, everyone around you has to breathe that and they've all -- they've proven that children in households where the parents are smoking get sick more often.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I think a lotta people would, you know, try not to smoke in the house around their children --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even if they continue to smoke.
R:  And this is also better to -- if your parents smoke then it is easier for you to begin one day because ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  The parents should be responsible.  I don't have children.  So ...
L:  Well, we just finished a study that showed that if parents quit by the time the children are eight years old --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that, you know, it's pretty likely the kids won't start.
R:  Won't start.
L:  At least not because their parents smoke, but if they continue to smoke --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when their kids are older and they're -- they're at that impressionable age --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like junior high school --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- then -- then they'll start.
R:  I see.  Um, what -- what other bad -- bad habits are there?  Is -- is it only bad habits that ...?
L:  They talked about drinking.
R:  Drinking.
L:  They talked about gossiping.  They talked about, um, not exercising.
R:  Not exercising.  Not exercising is not a habit is it?
L:  I guess ...
R:  Well, maybe.  Maybe, yeah, um, sure, uh, it seems to be that smoking is the worst because, uh, I believe it's easier to quit drinking or --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, gossiping c- could have bad consequences too but, uh, it's not that, um -- it doesn't seem that bad.  It -- it hurts a lot of people though.  So, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- smoking does too.
L:  Well, yeah, socially it can hurt your family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- if you're an alcoholic, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Or if you get behind the wheel of a car when you're drinking.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  That's ...
R:  That's dangerous then.
L:  I don't remember them mentioning illegal drugs.  They may have.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, they should because, uh, it is -- it is, uh, a very common habit in the States, isn't it?
L:  Very common and it's also responsible for a lot of crime.
R:  Yeah, and it's -- it's -- it's among the teenagers more it seems, doesn't it?  Uh, I -- I don't know.  There are a lot of bad habits like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- eating the meals or, I mean [inaudible].  Actually all habits, uh, are -- our lives are driven by habits --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, um, the list could be longer.  But if you -- say, if you, uh, ask anyone to say the first, uh, bad habit, uh, he would, uh, think of it -- it would be smoking I think because ...
L:  Probably, yeah.  More people have exposure to that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH] It's like I have -- I have had some respiratory illness in the last year and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- whenever people around me smoke --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, I can get really sick.
R:  I see.
L:  Whereas before I didn't like it, but it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, it was just something I could afford.  But when you get to where it really bothers you really notice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it does seem like a lotta people smoke more when the weather's cold --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, I notice that.
R:  Or you -- you notice that because it smells.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Mhm.  If we meet one day I -- I promise not to smoke.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  Well, you have a lovely accent.  It must be from living in all those different countries.
R:  Yeah, that's right.  Um, uh, my English is worse, it's not good and -- but, uh, it is not a Turkish accent, it's a German accent and ...
L:  Right.  Yeah, it is.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  All German, uh, people who, uh, learn English later they, uh, speak like this and, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- one day I -- I was in Turkey and an American school teacher asked me if I know German.
L:  Yes.
R:  I said, "How do you know?" --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and she said all -- all the German people speak English like you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, uh, so I think I -- I -- I'm happy with it.  I don't try to, uh, gain an American accent and I don't think that would be very easy for me.
L:  Oh, you sound -- I -- I have no problem understanding you at all.
R:  Yeah.  That is -- thank you.  [LAUGH]  That's good.  That makes me happy because I have, uh, always feel that, uh, I will be wrongly +understood and, uh, people will not understand me.  So, I don't talk a lot to people.  One of the reasons, uh, attending this study was, uh, to be able to talk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to someone on the phone and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, uh, that ...
L:  Well, I think this is a wonderful way to do a study.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, it's nice to be involved in a study that doesn't involve --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, any drug trials or anything.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I would like to know more about this study, but I don't know, uh, how they will, um -- how -- how they will, uh --
L:  Did you ...?
R:  -- what -- what are they looking out for?
L:  Um, I think they're looking for the way people communicate --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, I -- I did get on the website, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and look at it a little bit and I can't remember now.  I think it was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the Univers- -- I can't remember.  But the address was ...
R:  Um, Pennsylvania -- University of Pennsylvania I think.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  There was a little bit of information there and then I think they had some contact people you could talk to --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- if you wanted to find more about it.
R:  That's good.  I, um -- I -- are you at home now?
L:  I am, yes.
R:  Um, okay.  Um, I'm in Redmond town center.  I'm every day in Redmond town center and all day I am selling toys here.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's why I hear children.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Here children -- lots of children and the toys.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm just near to the pool and if you come by any day --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you can -- we can talk face to face whenever you want.
L:  I have a friend who lives in Redmond.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  So, whenever I come to see her maybe we could come by there.  She has children.  [LAUGH]
R:  Good.  [LAUGH]  Good.
L:  That's gotta be exciting.
R:  Uh, yeah.  Please visit me and, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- we can go on talking.  Uh, I will be here only this month.  So, if you will be able --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would be very happy to meet and talk with you because we are just about at ten minutes, you know?
L:  Is, uh, Redmond town center a mall or just a shopping area?
R:  It's a mall.  It's a mall.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's a, uh -- everybody in Redmond would know this place and, uh, it's --
