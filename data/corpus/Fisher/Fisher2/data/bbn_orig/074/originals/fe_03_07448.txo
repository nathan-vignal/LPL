R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Harriet[?] in Atlanta.
L:  Hi, this is Kelly[?] in LA.  How are you?
R:  LA, oh right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Good.
R:  How's the weather there?  [inaudible] --
L:  It's okay.  It's fine. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's quite -- it's quite -- it's not hot, it's just --
R:  It's not?
L:  -- quite warm.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Kelly, I um -- I'm really not one to watch reality TV that much.  I -- I never watch Survivor.  I never watch, um, The Bachelor or Bachelorette or any of those reality shows.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I think the only thing that I've -- I don't know whether you consider a reality show is American Idol?
L:  Um --
R:  That's different, right?
L:  I don't --
R:  No?
L:  -- think it's considered a -- a [inaudible] --
R:  I don't think so.  You don't think so.
L:  -- no.
R:  I haven't watched any of em.  Ah, do you watch them?
L:  How come?
R:  Ah, I guess I'm just so busy -- ah, and -- and TV just hasn't been a big thing to me, you know?
L:  Okay.
R:  I watch -- yeah, I watch the news.  I watch a few movies on Lifetime.  I watch, ah, basketball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm a sports fanatic, um --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, but --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but I haven't really been into reality TV.  Um, [NOISE] it's just -- I think it just takes away from the actors and the true actors and actresses of today --
L:  You think so?  Really?
R:  -- and so -- yeah, I mean -- because you know, they're taking their TV time from all of those actors.  So, I think --
L:  Yeah, but I mean -- um, if -- television shouldn't be about, you know, supporting the acting industry -- just should be like entertainment and if people feel that r- reality TV i- is -- entertain- entertaining to them also --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- why not?
R:  Okay.  So, do you watch them?
L:  Um, I'm kind of busy so I don't -- and I personally don't have cable [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I don't watch that much TV.  So --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- I really don't, but um --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I have, you know, in the pa- --
R:  And you asking me, "Why not?". [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I don't -- I don't know, I never found it necessary to get a cable because I'm not -- you know, I -- oh, my God, how often do I watch TV, like once a week? [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Okay.
L:  So -- um -- but I have -- you know, in the past I have watched, um, all these shows.  I have watched Extreme Dating and Blind Date and Survivor and what else is it?  Fear Factor --
R:  Oh, you have?  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I just, you know, don't really follow it.  But they're -- to me, they're quite entertaining, to be honest and sometimes I like them better than, ah -- because I don't really ever watch movies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so to me, if I have the choice between like a -- ah, like let's say General Hospital or something like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then, um, a reality TV show?  I'd prefer the reality TV show.
R:  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm probably --
L:  Yeah, because --
R:  -- not into soap operas.  Yeah, I -- I understand that.  I'm not into soap operas [inaudible].
L:  It's just, um -- the -- the good thing about them though is you don't have to pay close attention --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because you can do something else like, I don't know, some laundry or something --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and since they don't have really a plot, you don't really have to f- -- you know, follow it?
R:  So, it's not like you have to -- yeah, you're not -- it's not like, "Oh, what did I miss yesterday?".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  [inaudible] -- so, it's n- -- something new and different each time?
L:  Yeah.  So, I -- I just feel they're entertaining [inaudible] --
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I -- um, I -- I don't know that I would even start watching them.  I mean, I don't think they would do anything for me.
L:  Yeah, I mean, if you're not into -- like the American Idol --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- everybody was crazy about it, but I don't know, to me it was like, "No".
R:  A- and to be perfectly honest with you, I think I watched -- ah, I watched the first one --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or, I guess, the one with Justin and ah, Kelly --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I did watch that one, but I watched American Idol once with ah, Clay and um, Reuben --
L:  Reuben?  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I watched it one time, that's it.
L:  Yeah, I think it's kind of like -- I think that was probably the last time that did it, because this time it was not as big anymore as the first time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I -- I just felt it was kind of boring, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Basically seeing people audition, no.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I agree.  I wasn't into it.  Ah, you know, when I learned that, ah, Reuben had won, I learned it on the news or on the ET.  I smiled and thought--
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Okay -- [LAUGH] okay, so he won.  Congratulations". [LAUGH]
L:  Because they're -- yeah, I wasn't -- but a lot of people liked it, but I personally didn't, so.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  But yeah -- but the reality TV just doesn't do anything for me, um --
L:  Um, what a- -- the only thing that I don't like is, um -- well, I watch it and I like it, but I think it shouldn't be on TV is Cops.  I don't know if you've ever seen that show?
R:  I watched the -- I watched, I would guess maybe about fifteen minutes of it once and that's about it.
L:  Yeah, because it's like --
R:  So, is that reality TV?
L:  Huh?
R:  Is it reality TV?
L:  Yeah, because it's about real crimes that happen[?], you know?
R:  Oh, is it?  Okay.  Okay.
L:  But --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- I feel that -- I don't know, I think it's kind of i- inappropriate to show.  I don't know.  You know, if somebody, I don't know, beat up their -- their family or somebody, I don't know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is caught, you know, dealing drugs or something, I don't think that they should put them on TV and this I --
R:  So, they show all of that?
L:  -- I think it's entertaining.  Huh?
R:  They show all of that?
L:  Yes, they --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- what they do is they have, um, like, ah, different cases and there would be an officer and he would explain, "Okay, we just got a call and this guy, he beat up his family again and it's the third time" so they will show how they knock on the door and how they don't want to answer and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- whoever answers the door is crying and running out.  So they're -- they're -- you know, show the whole thing un- until that person gets arrested actually --
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  -- and it's kind of like -- I don't know, I think -- I feel it's kind of improper.
R:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
L:  But it's entertaining, so.
R:  [MN] Mhm.  [several inaudible words] --
L:  But -- you know, I was just thinking, let's say that, that would have been, I don't know, like my cousin or something I -- I -- I don't know, I don't think that should be on TV, but [MN] ...
R:  My cousin [inaudible], what is that?
L:  No, I'm just saying if that was somebody I knew --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- or some- -- you know what I mean?  Somebody --
R:  Okay.  [several inaudible words].  Okay.
L:  -- else connected, who I wouldn't -- yeah, I don't think this should be on TV, but ...
R:  Yeah, I understand.  I understand.  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I agree with that.  I agree with that. [MN]
L:  So --
R:  Yes.  Mhm.
L:  But otherwise I think that most of these, ah -- I don't know, like Blind Date or what else is there, like Survivor?  I mean, it's -- you know, [inaudible] these people, um, actually audition, you know, to go there, so.
R:  Well, you know what, when I think about it, I did watch, ah, Blind Date once.  One -- one little episode --
L:  You did?
R: -- and I had n- -- yeah, but nothing else.  That's the only one.
L:  Did you like it?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  Not really?
R:  [LAUGH] No, I did- -- no.  Uh-uh.
L:  Was it boring or just ...?
R:  [LAUGH] I -- I guess it's different for me.  I don't want to the world to know what's going on with me, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, me neither.  I would never wanna be on it.
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  No --
R:  And -- and, you know, like some of the things that they were saying about each other, I'm like, "Gosh, I wouldn't want everybody to know I hate this guy's guts, you know, and I think he is so ugly" or [LAUGH] you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  You know?  So, no I'm -- I don't like that. [MN] I don't like that [several inaudible words] --
L:  No.  What I don't like is they had this one show, what was it called, um Elimidate?  And --
R:  What is it?
L:  -- and there's this one -- Elimidate.
R:  Elimiting?
L:  Elimidate.
R:  Eliminate?
L:  Elimidate.  It's like a combination of eliminate and date.
R:  Elimidate.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  And, um, there was this one guy and he, um, gets to meet, ah, five girls --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then, um -- you know, they're all trying to get his, ah -- you know, get his attention.  So, each round he elimidate's one.
R:  So, it's almost like The Bachelor?
L:  Yeah.  So, he gets rid of one of em --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so -- and they get really nasty, so the girls who were like -- you know, on the first date they will kiss him and kiss each other and get naked in a pool just to -- you know, to get picked at the end.  And I felt this was really, like, tasteless --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- it gives you like -- when you watch the show it's like, "Okay.  If I'm not -- you know, if I'm not doing this with you on the first date, you don't want me?" you know?
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  This bit I didn't like, because it seemed that anybody who was acting normal and more like a -- you know, like a -- ladylike --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- got elimidated.  Whoever was most nasty got picked --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I felt it sent the wrong message.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I can -- I can agree with that.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, so -- so this -- this I didn't like.
R:  Right, I understand.
L:  So -- but --
R:  Yeah, so you're in LA.  Are you from LA?
L:  No.
R:  No.  So, you just -- how long have you been there?
L:  Um, a year.
R:  A year?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I like it very much.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah, it's very nice.
R:  I -- I like visiting LA.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I do.  I -- I have, um -- the guy I used to be engaged to lives there, so I see him, um, maybe once every two or three years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, um, I like to come to visit LA. [NOISE]
L:  What was the other -- do you know if the whole topic was just reality T- -- reality TV?
R:  Yeah.  They -- I think they said re- -- I think it was only reality TV if I'm not mistaken.
L:  What do you think about this court, um -- ah, these court shows like Jud- --
R:  Oh, I don't like those either. [LAUGH]
L:  Judge Judy Fox or whatever it is. [LAUGH]
R:  No, I don't like those either.
L:  You don't like them either?
R:  Uh-uh.  You know?  And that's -- that's another thing, I don't want the world to know, especially like y- -- I don't want them to know if I'm suing my family members or if I'm --
L:  I --
