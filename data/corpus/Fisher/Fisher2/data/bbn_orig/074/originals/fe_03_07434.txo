R:  Ah, hi, my name's Cindy[?].
L:  Hi, my name's Marsha[?]. [NOISE]
R:  Ah, do you watch reality [LAUGH] TV?
L:  Oh, I've watched a couple.  My daughter is more into em than I am. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I generally don't watch it, but I watch the ones with celebrities out in the woods or something.  I don't even know what it was.
L:  Yeah, I -- I've -- we watched the one that was, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.
R:  I think that must have been it.
L:  Yeah, with, ah, Robin Leach and some [several inaudible words] like that, ah, Bruce Jenner?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, that was me.  I watched that one.  My -- my daughter's r- -- into liking to watch em.  I -- [several inaudible words] I don't care for em.  The Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire? and all that kind of stuff, it's -- I don't know, I just -- it -- it's -- it might be reality, but it's no reality I've ever heard of. [LAUGH]
R:  That's the same thing with me.  I think most of em are pretty bad, but I was flipping around and caught that one and it was -- it was pretty funny trying to watch the celebrities try and live, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  That's it, you know?  Bring em down a peg, they don't have their maids and [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everything else and having to do -- and everything.  That was real good.  And that's like the one that they've got now, um, For Love Or Money --
R:  I haven't --
L:  -- where they've got all the girls there to see this guy and whoever he picks will get the million dollars and -- but he's not -- he don't know if they're in it to love him or for the money that they can win.
R:  Is that -- is that another fake one, where like he doesn't actually have the money?
L:  Well, um, the -- it's -- to him, it's just one of the set up dating things --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- like the millionaire or whatever.  The part he don't know anything about is whoever he picks, the girl will get a million dollars --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- regardless if they go any further or don't or whatever.  And I'm like, "That's dirty pool". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] The same with the other one about the Joe Millionaire that didn't have any money.
R:  That was it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't even remember the names [LAUGH] of these shows, I watch --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- them so little.
L:  Yeah, I see the commercials all the time and what not, when I am watching a little bit of TV, but my daughter's always, "Let's watch this".  I'm like, "No, I don't think so" and, um, the other one with all the stars on it's the um -- The Mole.
R:  Oh, I heard about that on, ah, I think, [inaudible] TV --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] making fun of it.
L:  Yeah, that one gets kind of good.  Some -- one of -- one of the stars [NOISE] was sabotaging the others [NOISE] to keep them from getting a bunch of money in the pot.  So, it -- it was a little -- it was pretty good.  A little different. [MN]
R:  I haven't seen it.  I haven't even seen a commercial for that one.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Just a take off on it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, how do you talk for eight minutes to a total stranger [LAUGH] on something you don't watch. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That -- that's [inaudible] I tell ya.  But that's me -- I'm -- the reality shows, I'm just tired of em, really.  It's like we live reality, we don't want reality. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  I wanna watch science fiction shows, but the cancelled all of them, like, ah, Dark Angel and Firefly.
L:  Yeah.  That's it.  Or they put em all on sci fi.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Everything's moved over there.  Stargate and Sliders and ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, we still have, ah, Stargate, here in Alabama.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, we -- we've got the reruns now, all the new ones are co- -- that'll be out next year they'll be on the sci fi channel.
R:  Mm.
L:  That's what I said, that aint right. [NOISE] Get you hooked on it, then move. [NOISE]
R:  At least they're still making it, I guess we'll have to buy em on DVD. [LAUGH]
L:  That's it. [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  That's what I say, with the reality ones, if they want everybody to do reality, they ought to make em a reality channel --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and sell all the reality shows over there [several inaudible words] there's no reality there I've ever seen.
R:  Unfor- --
L:  Mm.
R:  Unfortunately, they're cheaper to make, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words] you don't have to pay writers. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Pay --
R:  Well --
L:  -- pay somebody to come up with a bunch of far out ideas, "Okay, let's make em eat, ah, madagascar cockroaches".  Yeah, that's a good one.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I think they'd bring back the arena if they could. [LAUGH] I mean, think about how many people would watch that.
L:  That's it. [NOISE] [several inaudible words] they've gone overboard with em though, I -- that's me, I've -- I got burnt out.  I watched the first one or two of the Survivor's and then that was it.  That's enough of that too.
R:  I read in the TV guide last week for Fear Factor, they were -- somebody was carrying rats in their mouth or something, that was the description of it and it was like, "Who wants to see that?".
L:  [LAUGH] That's it. [NOISE] And the one I've heard some of them on the computer and what not raving about, they want to do a modern day Hillbillies, go get em some hicks out of the woods somewhere and put em in the middle of Hollywood and what not. [LAUGH]
R:  Boy, I'm in the middle of Alabama, I wouldn't [LAUGH] turn on the TV to see that, I can look around. [LAUGH]
L:  That's [LAUGH] me.  I'm -- I'm in South Carolina now, but I'm from Georgia, I'm from the swamp myself.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And as I say -- ah, that's it again, if I want reality [LAUGH] I'll go outside.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] And the Survivor's and stuff, I said, "Okay, they're taking them and putting them on all these tropical islands and things" I said, "Okay, let's put em some snow.  Let's take em to the Arctic somewhere and drop em off". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Put the writers [LAUGH] there, yeah, that would be a good idea [several inaudible words] --
L:  There you go, the -- the ones that come up with this stuff to begin with.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That it's.  If they wanted to do something like that -- I used to like to watch like the celebrities, when they'd get the football teams and stuff, the players offer them to do the games and stuff, that was kind of neat to watch.  But everybody else was like, "Yeah.  Come on". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, they say there's no drug problem in Hollywood, right. [LAUGH]
L:  That's it.  Somebody was on something to come up with some of that stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I think they only do this because the -- the same people who watch it, must be the same people who respond to those commercials to buy more and more things. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, the-- "My stuff is six months old, let's go out and buy new stuff".
L:  That's it.
R:  Boy, this is harder than [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
L:  A little bit. [MN] Like you say, when they give you a topic that -- you don't watch the -- we don't watch the shows that much, I've seen them on commercials a little bit, my daughter has a set to watch them, but I'm like, "I don't think so.  That's too far out there".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, I'm -- I'm with you though, the -- the ones that are the cutest ones are the ones that they put the celebrities on there and kind of make them do some things, that's pretty good to watch.
R:  The people at least you know by -- by seeing them in other things, so you -- while it's -- even if you don't care [LAUGH] at least, you know --
L:  That's it.
R:  -- some sort of connection.
L:  [several inaudible words] all they're doing is taking these people and two it's not people -- it wouldn't be your next door neighbor.  All these fit, lean people that they're going to put on these shows and what not, then they're just going to get a bunch of money for going on and doing commercials and making appearances on other shows and everything else.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That -- that's not reality.
L:  That's it.  I don't think I've seen anybody that would look like they would be one of my neighbors on any of those shows.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not any of my neighbors either.
L:  That's it.  They want somebody to pick -- okay, put em up on the computer and let's let people pick the ones we want to put on there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Don't let the writers and everything else pick the people they're going to put on there. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it's certainly not average.
L:  That's it.  [several inaudible words] average and what not, you can go back to the Huxtables, yeah a doctor and a lawyer --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- there's one of those -- there's a family like that in my neighborhood. [LAUGH]
R:  No, no, no, to have reality they have to go back to [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
L:  There you go. [LAUGH]
R:  Good times.
L:  And come back a little further. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That would be reality these days.
L:  That's it.  Getting closer to more people's reality than the stuff they've got on there.
R:  Mhm.  They'll have [several inaudible words] projects [LAUGH] if the economy doesn't turn around soon.
L:  That's it.
R:  Boy, it's hard to talk about this. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  I know I've said that like twenty times.
L:  I was trying to think if there was any other shows or anything else that they're talking about coming on or anything.
R:  I can't remember any of em.  I jus remember about the celebrity one where they go, "I'm getting wet", "Well, get under the plastic, you got a plastic tarp right next to ya, get under it". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that wa- -- that was the one about I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, that was -- it was pretty cute.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they would even make that better if, you know, you could just get to the web at any time and, you know, check out some of the cameras to see what they were doing all day.
R:  Oh, that would be nice.  Multiple angles.
L:  Yeah, just not -- just say what they're doing for the stuff they put on TV, but if you want to just see what they're doing any time of the day, just go and pop on and, you know, have one of the cameras somewhere or something.
R:  I don't think you could get any celebrity that'd agree to go on it then. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] As I say, they -- they had some pretty go- -- they had some fun with those though.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That was pretty good.
L:  You know, seeing them out- outside of their -- their normal ...
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  They had to come up with some pretty good stuff then.
R:  [several inaudible words] celebrities on their own, I mean, they did such stupid [LAUGH] things.
L:  [LAUGH] That's it.
R:  I think in real life these people must like have handlers telling them what to do or something.
L:  Mhm.
