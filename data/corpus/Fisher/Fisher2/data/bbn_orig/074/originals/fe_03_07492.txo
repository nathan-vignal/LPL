L:  [NOISE]  Hello?
R:  [NOISE]  Hello, I'm Stephanie.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hi, I'm Amanda.  How are you?
R:  Good, How are you?  [SIGH]
L:  I'm good.  Where are you calling from?
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm calling from Boston, Massachusetts.  How -- how about you?  [SIGH]
L:  Really?  I'm in Jersey City, New Jersey, actually.
R:  Oh, really?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  This is a great study.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My friend just found it on Craig's List a- and [LAUGH] this is my first call for it.  So, ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  This is my second.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like it.  It's cool.
R:  Y- yeah, it -- it's definitely interesting.  [SIGH]  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  S- s- so, ...
L:  Um, I think we have to talk about h- holidays.  Um, we're supposed to pick one.
R:  Y- yeah.  [LAUGH]  U- u- um, my favorite holiday probably is the Fourth of July.  [MN]  And --
L:  Okay.  Why so?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Um, that's just because I like holidays where there's n- not a lot of pressure to, like, h- have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a great time.  Like, on New Year's Eve you're expected to kind of have [SIGH] big --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- plans and supposed to --
L:  Go overboard and --
R:  -- be like a huge event.
L:  -- yeah --
R:  Yeah, I mean --
L:  -- you kind of feel like a loser --
R:  -- a lot of times [SIGH] --
L:  -- if you don't do something.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, e- exactly, exactly, exactly.  And, like, um, you know, if you -- you always end up -- it always ends up being, like, under rated because --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- I mean under [SIGH] -- well, you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what I'm trying to say because --
L:  It's over rated because you can't -- you -- you -- your expectations of it never actually --
R:  Y- yeah, it's a big --
L:  -- pan out to what --
R:  -- let down at the end of the night.  [LAUGH]
L:  It is.  It r- really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L: -- is.  [SIGH]  Oh, man --
R:  So, I like the Fourth of July just because, um, there's not a lot of pressure.  You know, just 'cause it falls in the summer, everybody's in a good mood, um, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] you know, it's not just --
L:  What do you normally do -- like, how do you celebrate the day?  [SIGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, I normally just hang out with friends --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and have cook out and d- drink.  I was in San Diego last year so we went to the beach.  So, that was nice.  [SIGH]
L:  O- oh, cool, like all the --
R:  And I always like to see the fire cr- --  [NOISE]
L:  -- bon fire things.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's cool.
R:  [LAUGH]  H- how about you.  What's your -- what's your favorite holiday?
L:  I a- actually like Mother's Day, um, only because -- I mean I'm not a mom personally but I think it took me a lot of years in order to really appreciate my mom.  So, now --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- that I'm older and I really, you know, think about the things that she's done for me and just thinking about [SIGH] -- like, watching my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- cousins with their kids and things.  I'm not a mom yet, so [SIGH] I see the hard work that goes into it; the twenty four hour day jobs that they have, and [SIGH] they don't get appreciated --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- every single day.  So, it's, like, [SIGH] when it does come around it should be made a big deal [NOISE] because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they don't get the recognition they really, really deserve, --
R:  S- sure I bet your mom --
L:  -- especially, if they have rotten kids.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- would really like to hear you saying that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, no, seriously --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- like, I tell ... her all the time --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- 'cause now, I mean, I'm twenty five years old and it's just like, [SIGH] you know, ah, you realize just how much they did for you.  Because you can just see somebody like in the supermarket with their kids and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] the struggle of having to be alone and [SIGH] do all the stuff and watch the kid and, you know, what I'm saying and it's just [SIGH] -- it's a big deal for me.  So, now I try to, like, [SIGH] take her out and, like, I'll take her to a Broadway s- show and take her to lunch or g- go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- give her a massage or something, you know.  And it's just [SIGH] to me --
R:  T- that's n- nice.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, and it's cool because my birthday always falls around the same weekend.  So, [SIGH] we actually, like, do for each other.  You know, so to me it's a big deal because it's -- it commemorates my birthday and ... just being [NOISE] with her and, [SIGH] you know, just being my mom's friend, not so much her daughter, you know, being like her girlfriend --
R:  R- right, and --
L:  -- 'cause now I'm old enough to do it.
R:  -- it takes a long time to get to that point too.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Like, I'm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- starting to r- recently feel the same way about my mother too 'cause you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] as you get older -- a little bit older you ki- kind to start to actually like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- l- listen to what she has to say.
L:  E- exactly.
R:  And, you're like, "Cool, she actually knew more than I thought she d- did".  [LAUGH]
L:  E- exactly, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and they -- they know everything.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it's so scary because they still know everything that's going to happen to you.  [LAUGH]
R:  R- right.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  And it's so weird that -- that we mention -- I mentioned Mother's Day today -- today's Father's Day but [SIGH] it's -- I guess it's just strange because it's like we automatically have the instinct to g- go to our moms or whatever.  But [SIGH] it's funny --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- you said Fourth of July and we were just -- I was just talking to -- my family were having a barbecue today and we were trying to come up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with plans for Fourth of July.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  And you're right, it's so simple because you wear whatever you want, you go.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  You don't think -- you get to see the little kids, they're expressions when they first see fireworks.  And, [SIGH] --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- you know, everybody just eats and drinks and hangs out and stuff, you're right.  It's summer --
R:  It's more like a celebration of just being --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- +alive -- being alive and having fun and, [SIGH] you know, --
L:  E- exactly.
R:  -- and just kind of, like, -- ah, like being with the people that you care about, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- rather than f- feeling like there's like s- some important event that has to -- that's being celebrated.  Not that [LAUGH] --
L:  E- exactly.
R:  -- Independence Day isn't an [LAUGH] I- important event but [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.  I think --
R:  -- you know we're probably not --
L:  -- I think --
R:  -- thinking about it.  [SIGH]
L:  -- though, -- but you know what it is though, I think that [SIGH] people need to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- well, n- not many people but, like, [SIGH] nobody really knows what the day is about.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, what I'm saying like we don't --
R:  Right.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we don't c- celebrate [LAUGH] why it was invented [LAUGH] and think [SIGH] we just know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "Oh, we don't --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- have to go to school or work" we get to eat and drink.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  It's kind of sad but in a way I mean it's good at least that people recognize it, and it's such a w- world wide thing so [SIGH] --
R:  Yes, --
L:  -- I think --
R:  -- definitely.
L:  -- it's really cool.
R:  Do you go to the Jersey S- show event for the Fifth of July?  [NOISE]
L:  You know, what it is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- no, honestly, it would be way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- too much traffic.  It's just too horrendous because it gets so packed over there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm not far from it, maybe about an hour away from it.  But, [SIGH] just being -- you'd be stuck on the highway [SIGH] for t- the whole day [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, then you --
L:  -- unless you go there earlier you don't -- it's, like, don't even bother so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But believe it or not I live right -- right on the border of New York so if wanted to I could go to the water and then they have -- they have the barges in the middle of the water where they do like the Macy's fireworks and things.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  So, if I got a good spot by the water [SIGH] it'd be great just to have a blanket and food and hang out with people and [LIPSMACK] celebrate there, because you get to stay there all day, do your thing and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] literally see the fireworks right off the barge.  So, like, you get the w- whole shebang, like, forget watching TV, you can +literally see it right in the water.  So, ...
R:  Oh, that's neat.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it's really cool but, [NOISE] you know, --
R:  That's really cool.
L:  -- [NOISE] I'm trying to --
R:  [SIGH]  Wow!  Well [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- do you, like, -- well do you enjoy F- Father's Day as well?  [SIGH]  Do you celebrate Father's Day?
L:  You know, what it is my dad -- my dad's not really like the big, guy, like, "Oh, I need a gift or whatever" you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- he kind of does his own thing.  As long as we remember him and we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, buy him a toy, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- buy him something he likes or whatever, then --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- he's happy that we just --
R:  That's nice.
L:  -- remembered.  [SIGH]  Yeah, that's -- like,  --
R:  That's nice.
L:  -- I don't have any brothers so it's just me and my sister.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- f- for me ... and her to go shopping for him -- something.  Give him a gift, he's happy.  But I think if he had a son it would be celebrated --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a little bit differently.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  But h- he doesn't care.  He's cool with it.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  [NOISE]  Right.  That's interesting.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My dad's the opposite.  He likes to be waited on hand and foot.  He needs gifts.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  He needs [LAUGH] us to stay [LAUGH] with him all day but it's okay because he's the greatest.  So, it's nice to kind of --
L:  What did you guys do today?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, today we -- well my -- my dad and my uncle and I are runners.  So, we woke up early -- my uncle lives across the street so we woke -- woke up early and we all went running together.  So, that was nice.  We got to spend that time together.  [SIGH]
L:  Very cool.  That's nice.
R:  And t- then we just came back here.  I gave him his gift.  I've got him, like, a sports book because he's all into --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sports.  So, he was happy --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- about that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  N- nice.
R:  And we -- I made breakfast.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, that was, like, my duty for the day.  [SIGH]
L:  Very cool.
R:  Then we just went to a cook out at my -- at my uncle's house.  So, we had a very nice day, you know, just we got to spend the whole day with the family.  So, [SIGH] --
L:  That's really cool.
R:  -- it was good.  It was good.  It -- how about you?  What did you do today?
L:  Actually, my dad he -- we have a second -- second house in Pennsylvania and he actually went up there 'cause my mom ... g- goes on a little vacation, like, by herself.  Like down to Wildwood New Jersey.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  He's not a beach guy.  He likes the mountains so [SIGH] his actually -- his [COUGH] Father's Day was spent in solitary confinement.  He loves it.  [SIGH]  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he went up there to be alone but we'll always give him his gift when he comes back.  And [SIGH] my dad -- my dad's an architect --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and a contractor so I b- bought him, like, this tool that he wants.  So, I'm +sure -- sure when he gets back he's going to be ecstatic.  [SIGH]  He's really like a little kid in Toys R Us.  [SIGH]  So, [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, that's good I'll -- I'll like to actually see his expression on his face after Father's Day because then, you know, he'll feel like, like it's just like extended for him.  [MN]
R:  R- right.
L:  So, ...
R:  That's nice he got to do his own thing on the day and then he'll still get a gift afterwards.  That's --
L:  Oh, God, yeah, he's --
R:  -- nice.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- up there playing with his toys now.  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  -- I'm excited for him.  [SIGH]  Wow!  So, let me --
R:  So, if you could --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  No, go ahead.  [SIGH]
L:  No, no, no but I -- I -- I didn't know what you were --
R:  Oh, I was just -- I was just going to say, um, the other topic of conversation is if you could create a holiday what would it be?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  I didn't hear that part.  Hm.
R:  Oh, I think that's what it was.  I don't know, maybe we only have to talk about one thing.  What were you going to say?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, no, no I was just -- no, [LAUGH] I was just kind of [LAUGH] trying to just keep going.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh!  [LAUGH]
L:  How funny.  [SIGH]  I don't know.  Well, if you could create one what would it be?
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh!  [SIGH]  Yeah, I haven't actually thought about that until this v- very minute.  But [SIGH] I mean it would just be something that's like -- sort of like a celebration of just, like, life maybe.  I mean, [SIGH] you know, something --
L:  Yeah
R:  -- that doesn't have any, like, religious --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- connotation.  I feel like in o- other countries [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they sort of, ah, like ha- -- like celebrate l- life more on like a daily basis.
L:  [NOISE]  I think you're right.  Yeah.
R:  You know, they have more holidays to just, sort of, like commemorate, like, them [SIGH] being with family and being happy and healthy.  And I think, like, if I ... could create a holiday it would just be like something like that.  [SIGH]  U- um, you know, just s- something -- another -- something else like the Fourth of July where you just got together with the people you --
L:  Right.
R:  -- cared about.  And [SIGH] I don't really know what I would call it but [LAUGH] that would --
L:  No, that sounds awesome.  That's a great idea.
R:  -- be my idea of a good holiday.
L:  Wow!  I -- I wish I would have thought of that.  That's really cool.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm.
R:  How about --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- you?
L:  [SIGH]  Honestly, I don't even [LAUGH] know.  My God!  [SIGH]  Um, [LIPSMACK] it's so weird [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- because I mean we have [NOISE] h- holidays that are for l- love.  We have them for appreciation. F- for, [SIGH] you know, people in our lives.  We have 'em for, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- freedom.  We have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'em for, you know, Christmas [NOISE] which, [SIGH] I guess kind of goes into kind of religion.  [SIGH]  Um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, j- just -- wow, we got Labor Day, Memorial Day, just -- I -- I think it's cool.  But I noticed [SIGH] that when I looked on my calendar at work for, like, days off [SIGH] we --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we -- we need -- we need another one in, like, June because [LAUGH] we get off in May and then we get off, like, at the end of --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- September.  I think there's a gap there.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you just decided we need one off in June.
L:  Yeah, we need --
R:  That sounds like a good plan.
L:  -- we need something [LAUGH] also in there that's like major.  That's, like, universal to get off --
R:  [LAUGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- of w- work.  [LAUGH]  I think --
R:  [SIGH]  Like Anti Work Day or something like that, --
L:  E- exactly.
R:  -- where we took the day off.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, 'cause it's like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- they have Secretaries Day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and Bosses Day.  It you're neither one of those you don't get anything.  So, [LAUGH] --
R:  R- right.
L:  -- we need to figure out something else.  Jesus ...
R:  Yeah, definitely.
L:  Oh!
R:  How does -- how this work?  Do they come on and tell you when you've spoken for ten minutes or do you just [SIGH] ...?
L:  Yeah, they -- I -- I think the operator comes through and she --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- just tells you -- she tells you, you have, like, thirty seconds to say goodbye or something.  [SIGH]  And --
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and that's it.  Yeah, it's cool.  [SIGH]  How did you hear about this?
R:  [SIGH]  Um, well I -- I actually, um, I h- have a really boring temp job right now.  [LAUGH]   So, --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- [SIGH] I spend a l- lot of time looking at Craig's List because they always have, um, [MN] interesting --
L:  What is that?  I never heard --
R:  -- topics.
L:  -- of that.
R:  [SIGH]  Um, Craig's List?  It's -- it's sort of like a search engine.  Um, it's sort of like for people in, like, their twenties and thirties.  It started in, like, the San Francisco Bay area.  [SIGH]  Um, and they --
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  -- po- -- they just post a lot of different --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of topics, like, [SIGH] um, about holidaying -- about, [NOISE] um, like help wanted.  About, like -- about research studies, things like that.
L:  Cool.
R:  So, there's just a lot of different topics on there.  [SIGH]  It's really interesting.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If you ever want to look at it, it's craig's list dot org.  And they have it [SIGH] -- you pick your state and then they kind of come up with different things that are going on in your area.  [SIGH]  So, my -- my friend and I --
L:  That's awesome.
R:  -- found it on line.  So, we were, like, "Okay, we should try that out".
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [LIPSMACK] we decided it would be interesting.
L:  No, it's pretty cool and they're pretty consistent with -- with the timing that you put in.  [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Here she goes.  She's going to come on.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, no, never mind -- that's my call waiting.  Oops!
R:  Oh, no!  [LAUGH]
L:  Never mind.  [LAUGH]  I'm wearing a button.  No, I'm not going anywhere but I just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I heard the beep and I thought that the operator was going to come through.  I was, like, "Oh, there's --"
R:  O- oh!
L:  -- [SIGH] I was, like, "There it is".  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, she should -- she should -- she's coming through soon because it's been -- it's definitely been over ten --
L:  Oh, no I'm not worried about it --
R:  -- but, um, --
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean no worry there at all.  [SIGH]
R:  They're consistent with --
