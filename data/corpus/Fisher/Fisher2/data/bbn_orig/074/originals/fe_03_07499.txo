L:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  Well, I'm a stay at home mom so every day's a holiday for me. [LAUGH]
R:  If I would -- if I would invent a holiday, I probably would make a Friday, just make Fridays off for everybody.
L:  Oh, wouldn't that be nice.
R:  Yeah, that'd be great.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Just give us the whole weekend starting Friday, you know.
L:  Oh, that would be nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wouldn't it be -- even be better if we only worked Saturday and Sunday? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that would even be better. [LAUGH]
L:  And then Monday through Friday you're off. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Five day holiday and two day working. 
R:  Wouldn't get too much done. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That'd really make us lazy. [LAUGH]
L:  I know. [LAUGH] Like Americans aren't lazy enough, right?
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] too much. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm glad I'm not in that category 'cause I'm very active so --

L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, I -- I went two times down there, it was kinda fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I didn't, you know, hang out too long to really enjoy DC.
L:  Right.
R:  What part of DC you live in?
L:  Yeah, I live in Virginia, actually.
R:  I mean in Virginia.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.

L:  It's Herndon.
R:  Hm, don't know it. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, it's kinda --
R:  I've been to Virginia Beach, though.
L:  Oh no, we're [MN] about two hours away from there.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  But, no, the fourth of July is really nice during, uh -- I mean, in -- in Washington.
R:  So you go -- so you go to Washington for fourth of July?
L:  Not anymore. [LAUGH]
R:  Why? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, it's just so crowded.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, I mean, you have to go really early --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and then find a good spot to see the, um --
R:  Right, the fireworks.
L:  The fireworks.
R:  Well, in New York that's no problem, you can see 'em from everywhere. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah, you go to rooftops, there's the big --
L:  Oh, see you -- yeah.
R:  There's the high buildings so, yeah.
L:  No, you can't do that unless you know somebody in DC.
R:  You go to the river by the place called Riverside --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you can see them from --
L:  Yeah.
R:  There's practically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  What would you say? [NOISE] Eas- -- not easy to get away from. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that's pretty cool, you know. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  If you have, like, nothing else to do you can always go see the fireworks.  I usually go to the beach --
L:  Oh, really, see that's nice.
R:  -- and then go see the fireworks at night, yeah.
L:  That's nice.
R:  That's pretty cool.
L:  [SIGH] No, we normally stay home [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  And then Memorial usually is for the people, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I know a lot of people, you know, I've known people, I've been in the military but, uh, that's a long story.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  But then I don't know, like, [SIGH] I don't like, like, President's Day.  Ah, that's a --
L:  Yeah, no, don't like that much.
R:  It's too early in the -- I don't like any holidays early in the week.  I always wish they would all be in the weekend.
L:  Yeah [NOISE] and you know --
R:  I don't understand why they gotta switch 'em every year on the calendar.  Why not just, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- instead of make it that date --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- just make it the Friday, that's -- we'll forget about the number.
L:  Right, right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it'd be nice, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just like Mothers' Day and Fathers' Day, they're always on Mon- -- Sundays. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Like today was Fathers' Day --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that was a nice day, you know.
L:  Yeah.  They're always on Sundays.
R:  Right.
L:  But you know another thing that would be nice would be to just, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what's it called, have the -- have the holidays on the weekend --
R:  Right.
L:  A weekend -- or a weekday but have it off.
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  'Cause not a holidays you get off. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's not fair, either.
L:  No, it's not.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] And I can see you like a lot of days off, uh?
L:  I do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's why I'm loving this stay at home thing. [LAUGH]
R:  You must work too hard --
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- for you to want so many -- how young are you?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You sound like, you know, you're very young.
L:  Yeah, I'm twenty six.
R:  [NOISE] Twenty six.  What do you want to be so restful? [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause I'm just always so tired. [LAUGH]
R:  So tired! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] How old are you?
R:  Me?  I'm thirty seven.
L:  Oh, so you're not far off.
R:  No.
L:  I mean --
R:  I don't look it, though.
L:  Really?
R:  I'm very young at heart, you know.
L:  Oh, good for you.
R:  I work out a lot and stuff and, you know, run [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ride bikes on track, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- keep my body young and mentally fit.
L:  That's good.
R:  [NOISE] So ...
L:  See, that's another thing, I don't exercise. [LAUGH]
R:  No?  Oh, you better, you're too young for that.
L:  [LAUGH] I don't have to yet so it's kind of -- [LAUGH]
R:  Don't -- don't -- don't -- don't become like the, you know -- the way the country's going, you know.
L:  I know.
R:  We got a lot of obesity for us.
L:  Obesity. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I don't think I could --
R:  That's the next topic I think they should pick.
L:  I know, obesity. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, 'cause it's a bad topic, you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, what I mean.
L:  I know.
R:  It's unbelievable.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I see these teenagers --
L:  [NOISE] No, I don't think I could ever be obese.  My body won't let me --
R:  Ah!
L:  -- my genetics.  I'm serious. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay, we'll see.

R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- like, two weeks later.
R:  Hm.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So we have good genetics. [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool.  And your husband's a skinny boy, too?
L:  He's not skinny, he's --
R:  [NOISE] Oh, he's a fat boy, uh?
L:  He -- well, no, he's not fat. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  He's just right. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, he's just right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  He's not --
R:  I wonder what just right is?
L:  Well, he's not skinny, he -- 'cause he works out --

L:  He -- he works out all the time.
R:  He takes care of his body, okay.
L:  Oh, yeah.  He's big on that.
R:  You keep -- you keep up to the line, uh?
L:  He's trying to get me to go to the gym.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, now he's going to have to do that to you. [NOISE]
L:  I know, he's trying. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you're a skinny girl so I guess he doesn't really have to do it.
L:  No, not yet, but he's trying. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He already bought me some, uh -- a membership to Golds. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cool, that's cool.
L:  He's like, "Come on, you got to".  Like, "Yeah, all right, whatever, some day".
R:  Ah! [LAUGH]
L:  Some day. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I can see you are lazy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're going to kill us, the way we're going off the topic. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.
R:  I guess it's not really that interesting, talking about holidays.
L:  Well, there's not much you can talk about.
R:  Yeah, right --
L:  Oh, okay if you --
R: -- because it's a day to be off.
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  What's fun, yeah, you laze around, you know.
L:  Well, if you could make one up ...
R:  Well, me, I usually get leisure things to do, you know, or go out with friends.
L:  Yeah.
