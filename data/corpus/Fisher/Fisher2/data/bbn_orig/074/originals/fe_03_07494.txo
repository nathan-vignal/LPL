R:  [NOISE]  H- hi!
L:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  Hello?
R:  [SIGH]  A- ah, I'm Patina.  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]  I'm sorry, what did you say?
R:  I'm Patina.
L:  Patina?
R:  Uh-hum.  Patina.
L:  Oh, ... okay, hi, I'm Tania.   [SIGH]  Also, --
R:  How are you?  [SIGH]
L:  -- I'm on my cellphone, so I can hardly hear you.  [SIGH]
R:  Okay.  I'll -- I'll try to speak up.  U- um, [LIPSMACK] so, um, [LIPSMACK] I ... don't have a favorite holiday [LAUGH] actually.
L:  I don't either.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yes.
R:  Oh!
L:  I'm [SIGH] not big on holidays, really.
R:  Oh, really?  Not even your birthday?
L:  [SIGH]  Well, that's not really a holiday, is it?
R:  Well, okay I don't know.  I mean -- I was -- I was actually --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just thinking that that might actually be my favorite.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um --
L:  [NOISE]  But -- [SIGH] yeah, okay, well l- let's see.  Um, well what about, a- ah, if you were to c- create your own holiday and how people would celebrate it?
R:  [SIGH]  Hm.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I don't know, I think it would +probably be something like [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Halloween [NOISE] for me.  But, [SIGH] let's say like ... good spirits of Valentine's Day but not, like, for a s- specific -- you know, it's not for your boyfriend or girlfriend --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, like, for everybody.  Kind of like a [SIGH] -- you know, like a goodwill holiday maybe.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R:  Like a dress up goodwill holiday [SIGH] --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- maybe.
L:  That sounds cool.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, let's see.  [NOISE]  Hm.
R:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  U- um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] maybe kind of like, um, [SIGH] did you ever see the movie, what is it called, Pass It Forward, I think --
R:  Okay.  Yeah.
L:  -- or, ... s- something like that.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Um, have you see that movie?
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  You know what I'm talking about?  Okay, so maybe -- I'm thinking maybe a holiday like that where you have to do something --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] you know, everyone is like, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- um, imperative that everyone ... participate and, um, ... [LIPSMACK] you have to do something for a stranger --
R:  [NOISE]  Oh!
L:  -- that they wouldn't be able to do for themselves.
R:  [SIGH]  That's very nice.
L:  Kind of a cool concept.  So, yeah, I'm thinking ... p- probably something like that.
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  Um, [SIGH] my daughter's favorite holiday is Halloween.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  I don't -- I don't know where she got that from but she just -- I guess she loves -- I think it's probably because she loves candy.
R:  R- right.  Well, it's kind --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- of s- strangers giving you candy and for once you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- actually take it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Hm?
R:  Well, I -- well, you know, for one time, like, in your life, you know, pe- -- you know, how you're not supposed to take strangers -- from candy but, --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- you know, so I guess there's, ... you know, --
L:  The one time --
R:  -- something nice.
L:  -- where it's okay?
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]  So, ...
L:  Yeah, um ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, [SIGH] these topics, where do they get them from?  Um ...
R:  Y- yeah.  Have you done this before?
L:  Y- yeah, this is --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- actually my third time.
R:  Oh, okay.  [SIGH]  Um ...
L:  This is your first?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Um, I don't know, do you have any, um, [LIPSMACK] -- well if you don't have a favorite holiday do you have any g- good memories of holidays?  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  U- um, [LIPSMACK] y- yeah, lots.
R:  O- o- oh!  Okay.
L:  You know, I -- it's not that I don't ha- -- you know, like -- like I don't celebrate but, um, --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, Christmases -- we don't really do the technical -- the [NOISE] -- yeah, ever since I was, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] little my parents have always explained to me that it's a commercialized holiday and everything.  So, [SIGH] we never --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- never really i- in -- in my immediate family we never really celebrated Christmas like that as far as giving gifts and stuff.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But, you know, other family members did.  So, you know, we ended up getting gifts anyway.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But, um, you know, back in the day when everybody was still in the United States, you know, that was like the one holiday [NOISE] where, like, all of my family, um, would get together and, you know, it was just great food and --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know, fun times.  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Also, +Fourth of July, --
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] um, we used to -- I, um, live in the DC area [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- so we used to go to, um, some Mall and that.  It's called The Mall but it's like, you know, [NOISE] um, where the ... Washington Monument [NOISE] is and different, um, museums and stuff [SIGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- where they have, like, this huge, [COUGH] a- ah, fireworks display --
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, nice.  [NOISE]
L:  -- at dusk.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Ah, so we used to do that e- every year.  That was like, you know, something that we used to do every --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- year.  We would +picnic -- picnic all day.  People would come out and picnic all day and then w- wait for the fireworks at dusk.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, that used to be a l- lot of fun.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Um.
R:  [NOISE]  But it's not --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So, those two p- particularly.  Hm?
R:  Y- yeah.  But you don't have, like, one in particular?  [SIGH]
L:  N- no.
R:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I t- think --
L:  No.
R:  -- for most people, y- you know, their family -- like, it's [SIGH] holidays are kind of about families and because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I'm from an immigrant family where, ... like, when we celebrate holidays it's just like the four of us.  The orig- -- you know, the normal family, like, mom, dad, me and my sister.  [SIGH]  Like, it's not like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a huge [SIGH] event where ... you know, I get to see d- different people I don't get to see on a normal basis.  Like for me I guess --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] h- holidays haven't ever been ... that --
L:  About fam- -- oh, okay --
R:  Well, it just -- it just hasn't --
L:  -- family gatherings.
R:  -- been that.  Right, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it just hasn't been that special because, you know, I -- it's almost like --
L:  Are you first generation over here?
R:  Yeah, I am.  Like I came here --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  -- when I was five.  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  Okay, where are you -- where are you from?
R:  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  I'm from Taiwan, originally.
L:  Taiwan?
R:  Yeah, it's like, -- y- you know, I speak Chinese.  It's like -- it's very, you know, it's Asian.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, yeah, so it's kind of like -- for me it's kind of like, you know, like Thanksgiving -- you know, people have like these [SIGH] huge -- you know, everybody has like, "Oh, we have to drive to this grandma's house --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- and then we have to --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- we have to have [SIGH] Thanksgiving lunch here and then Thanksgiving dinner here".  Like, for me it's [SIGH] been really simple, [SIGH] you know.
L:  Y- yeah.
R:  So, it's like -- so I don't really have any -- like, specific holiday ... [SIGH] memories --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I guess.
L:  Yeah.  Well the Fourth of July thing was just me and my sister, and my mom.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, -- y- yeah, it w- wasn't [LAUGH] you know, --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it wasn't like a huge --
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] huge gathering.  Main- mainly that's for, um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- C- Christmas and T- Thanksgiving but --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] like I said, you know, that used to be [NOISE] back in the day when I was little.  Like, last year [NOISE] we didn't --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- even -- we didn't even do anything.
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  Like, we never put up trees or anything like that anyway.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  But last year was like -- people were like, "What are you doing for Christmas?"  I was like, "It's just another day.  I'm trying to figure out what's on TV".
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, yeah, um --
R:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] you -- we -- I -- I celebrated it a lot more -- celebrated holidays a lot more when I was ... l- little than I am now --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- than I do now ... as a -- an adult.  [COUGH]
R:  Y- yeah, you think it's ... m- more of a ... kids' thing?  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, not that.  It's just like I said my family has, you know, everybody's moved out of the area.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  Everyone's, you know, -- everyone else's families have grown.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  I guess when I was a kid, um, you know, every -- everyone hadn't started -- my -- my -- my fa- -- oh, my mom's family, [SIGH] like her brothers and sisters, [SIGH] they didn't have their own families and inlaws and all that other stuff yet.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  [SIGH]  So, ah, you know, about coming home.
R:  Mm.
L:  Now they h- have their own families, their own lives.  So, --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- I guess, you know, as a family grows it kind of grows apart which is kind of sad but [SIGH] in my family we have a family reunion every year.  So, --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- most of the time, um, --
R:  [SIGH]  That's nice.
L:  -- everyone gets to see each other, at least once a year.  So, ...
R:  Huh.  Is that planned around a holiday?
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah, it's actually -- well it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- used to be like Fourth of July --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- weekend, but now it's like the week after Fourth of July.
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  So, it's like the second week of, um, ... July.
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  Wow!  Well, how does that work because -- I mean I know most f- family reunions take around [SIGH] holidays because that's when people have ... days off.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, I don't know --
L:  [SIGH]  We do it on the weekend.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it's, um, you know, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [SIGH]  So, anyone who's -- our family hasn't really branched out, um, you know, like [SIGH] across the world or anything like --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- that.  The farthest person lives in England --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- [SIGH] +with his family, u- um, [COUGH] but mostly everyone's in Virginia and, um, [LIPSMACK] some of the ... east coast, no one's, like, really on the west coast.
R:  Okay.
L:  [SIGH]  So, you know, it's -- it's a decent drive.  I think the farthest person has to come from, maybe like, ah, Georgia.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  So, it's -- t- their ride is about ten hours.  But --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] that's about it.  Everyone's pretty much kind of, you know, four hours, five hours away.  So, [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- it ends up working well t- to come on Friday and --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- be there Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's nice.  You know, I mean --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- hm, I don't know, like --
L:  Where are you?  Where are you?
R:  [SIGH]  I'm in New York actually.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The city or ...?
R:  Yeah, New York City.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, ... yeah, I mean my sister lives in New York City with me and ... m- my parents are in Texas.  [SIGH]  So, --
L:  O- o- oh!
R:  -- there's, like, ... +two of us in each [SIGH] pl- -- each place.
L:  Yeah, both -- both coasts.  Mm.
R:  [SIGH]  Well, t- there's no coast.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Texas has no coast.
L:  Y- yes.
R:  The no coast area.  [SIGH]  But, um, -- and the rest of our family is in Taiwan.  So, it's -- [SIGH] I don't know, I mean it's -- [SIGH] I guess it's --
L:  Well are there any, um, [SIGH] any holidays specific to your, um, [NOISE] native country that you ... celebrate or that your family, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is still -- still celebrates?
R:  Y- yeah, actually, um, like the biggest holiday f- for Chinese --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is [SIGH] Chinese New Year which is -- ha- -- ha- -- which h- happens, like, late +January or early +February. It's on the lunar calendar.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  So, [MN] um, -- so we do, y- you know, see each other -- Like it's a big thing, like, you know, some people actually celebrate it up for, like, the six days before a- and the six days after.  [SIGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, it's like, you know, it can be a really big holiday where you, sort of, like clean the house and, like, [SIGH] get new clothing and get a new haircut.  You know, like [SIGH] -- you know, basically like a- a regular New --
L:  Kind of like Christmas?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Y- yeah, I guess so and, y- you know, you get p- presents.  Well, no, you don't get presents.  You get money.  You get c- cash.  [LAUGH]
L:  O- o- oh!  [SIGH]  You know, see that's s- something --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Americans need to adapt that cash giving thing, man.
R:  [SIGH]  Well it's --
L:  You know, [NOISE] 'cause --
R:  -- I -- I mean I -- I think --
