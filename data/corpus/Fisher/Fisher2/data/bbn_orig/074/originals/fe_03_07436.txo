R:  [NOISE] Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, my name is Alice.
R:  [NOISE] My name's Wenda[?].
L:  And I'm from Oregon.
R:  I'm from Oklahoma.
L:  Oh!  My mother's from Oklahoma. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, yeah?
L:  Yeah.  Winniewood, very small town.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, you know it?
R:  I know where -- I know where it is, yes.
L:  Oh, for heaven's sakes.  Well, I guess the topic is reality TV and I don't watch it, do you?
R:  Yeah, I watch --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some -- some of it --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] I watch, um, [MN] Survivor occasionally and watch [NOISE] ah -- ah, what's the one where they -- the [NOISE] bachelor or bachelorette --
L:  Oh and --
R:  -- whatever that is, The Bachelor?
L:  -- yeah, and the million dollars or something like that?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't -- I don't always watch it but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I catch em if I'm at home and nothing else is going on.
L:  Right.
R:  But -- so -- so have you ever watched them?
L:  I -- you know, I never have.  I've not even watched one of them.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I don't really watch a lot of television.  I read a lot and --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- ah, but I do have some -- some different shows I like.  I like Law And Order [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which is like a cop show.  I think --
R:  Mhm.  Well, see now my -- my favorite is Trauma.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I've seen that I think.
R:  [LAUGH] But --
L:  It's -- it's funny sometimes how, ah, you know, you just find one that really interests you and you just keep on watching it.
R:  Right.  I like [NOISE] more, um, documentary type [NOISE] shows and --
L:  I do too.
R:  -- realistic [NOISE] type stuff than -- than the fake stuff but ...
L:  Right.
R:  Anyway -- but I -- I -- I have people in my house that watch The Bachelor and they keep me up on it, so.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  My granddaughter watches The Bachelor and --
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's mine, she does too and ...
L:  And she's probably a teenager?
R:  Ah -- well, she's in college now --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- so and -- and she's in a sorority, so all their house keeps up on --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they all watch it together, so.
L:  I think that's kind of --
R:  And [LAUGH] --
L:  -- that may be taking the place of the soaps that so many --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- people watch, but [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] go.
R:  I think it is and -- and now there's not a lot of people home during the day, where --
L:  R- right.
R:  -- they will watch it in the evenings, so.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But -- anyway -- but -- yeah, I'm not a -- I'm not true and blue to it but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so.  And then there's, um, the one that I thought was the most ridiculous was the -- where they -- ah, they meet each other and -- and mar- -- is it the millionaire one and like in a week they get married?
L:  Oh, I remember --
R:  He picks?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did read about the one that -- ah, maybe it was the first one and the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, they got -- I don't know whether they even got married.  I think they had a big fight or something before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it even happened [LAUGH] and, um ...
R:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  That one was really crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then there was Joe Millionaire who really wasn't a millionaire. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, right.  Right and another thing I read about that too is that the girls didn't know that he wasn't --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but how did -- how did they not know if, you know, the --
R:  I don't know, because it was pretty obvious to me, some of the things that he would say and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, just -- I would have thought you would have picked that, but he led a different life than some -- than what -- what --
L:  What he should have.
R:  -- he supposed to be portraying.  Yeah.
L:  Should have been.  Yeah.  Well, at the same time, didn't they read anything.  I mean, it was so publicized.
R:  Well, I guess [inaudible] they've already shot the show --
L:  I see.  Oh.
R:  -- therefore, y- you know -- they film it a long time before it ac- -- we actually see it, so.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, then that makes more sense.  I -- I wasn't quite sure how that worked.
R:  Yeah.  It's like the Survivor.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  Now, what about the, um -- [MN] oh, what's that one, the -- um, the dare -- what's it called, um, Fear Factor?
L:  Oh.
R:  Have you ever seen it?  Oh, I can't stand that one.
L:  You know, I haven't seen that either, but I have seen, ah, like, ah, previews of it --
R:  Yeah.  Oh --
L:  -- and ho- -- and I read about it.
R:  -- it's so awful.
L:  And -- oh, they put bugs in their mouths and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and oh, God.  And then they go into -- with a pit of snakes or something.  Have snakes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- crawl on them.  [MN] I have a terrible fear of snakes, that would be [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something I couldn't stand to watch.
R:  The bugs and eating all that weird stuff --
L:  Now, why?
R:  -- I'd be like, "Uh-uh".  Yuk.
L:  I know this que- -- that, you know, part of this question was, "What makes people interested in that?" and I don't understand that at all.
R:  No, I do not either.
L:  I don't know why people would do it and again, I don't know why people would watch it.  That would be the most --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- total waste of time.
R:  Now, for some reason we got interested in the, um -- ah, the one that was a celebrity -- I'm A Celebrity -- Get Me Out Of Here!
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, I -- I didn't see that either.  Wh- what happened there?
R:  Um, it was just celebrities and they had em on an island and they -- you know, they did things [NOISE] kind of like Survivor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but they had to earn their food and so.  But [NOISE] -- it was [several inaudible words] --
L:  So, how did they get to stay or leave?
R:  Ah, they were voted off --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- by a -- a telephone poll.
L:  Oh.
R:  You could call in and vote for you- -- the one that you wanted to get removed.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, for heaven's sakes.
R:  [inaudible].  Yeah.
L:  I --
R:  Now, what is the, um -- the one where the people sing? [NOISE]
L:  Oh, [inaudible] --
R:  American Idol.
L:  Oh, okay.  Now, that makes more sense to me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is it like the old Star Search?
R:  Yeah, that's right.
L:  Yeah, because ah, if , you know, they have some talent and, ah, that makes -- you know, then they --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- could go on to a career or something.
R:  That's true.
L:  So, that -- that I might watch.  I haven't, but I might watch [LAUGH] that one.
R:  Yeah.  I've watched it a few times but [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Anyway [MN] [NOISE] -- so.
L:  Well, television has certainly changed in a lot of years.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The -- the difference between, ah, types of shows.
R:  Oh, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  They kind of go in, ah -- ah, cycles, I think.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, for so many years -- a long time ago, of course, Westerns were just on all --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the time and now you like never see a Western.
R:  Mm mm.  No --
L:  But it's a --
R:  -- not a new one.
L:  -- lots of police shows --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and lots of medical shows.
R:  Yeah and the, ah, Crime Scene Investigation --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- all that's [NOISE] big now too.  But [MN] I don't know.  That, ah -- I guess Survivor was the first reality -- probably --
L:  I think -- I think you're right.
R:  -- that was the first show --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a- and got it all started, so.
L:  Yeah.  And then it just went on and on and on. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, everybody's trying to find their spin off of it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [NOISE] so.  And there's also --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the one, um, where they go around and search [NOISE] for the different -- they try to get home or try to get to certain destinations. [NOISE] Yeah, The Great Race.
L:  Oh, okay.  Haven't seen that one either.
R:  Yeah, they ha- -- they're -- they like team up and then [NOISE] they go all over the world, they'll -- you know, they'll get different clues --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they try to get back to [NOISE] a certain [NOISE] destination.
L:  Oh, that sounds kind of interesting.
R:  Yeah, it's not too bad. [NOISE]
L:  I don't know, I tend to watch --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you ever watch, um, Food TV?
R:  [NOISE] Yes --
L:  I watch that.
R:  -- that's just new on our cable.
L:  Oh, I like to watch [inaudible] --
R:  We just got that added.
L:  Yeah, Emerald Live, he's good.
R:  Uh-huh. [NOISE] Yeah, we like, um [NOISE] the, ah, Trading Spaces. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.
R:  We watch that.  We like those and, ah, they crack me up, the ones that, ah [NOISE] they come back in [NOISE] [several inaudible words] they have like two days -- it's not the Trading Spaces, it's the other one, While You Were Out --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- that's the one. [NOISE] [LAUGH] And then they come back in and they [several inaudible words] --
L:  And see what they've done?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Sometimes it's kind of a shock. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not quite exactly what they wanted.
R:  Oh -- right.  Right.  Yeah, sometimes on -- now, they did have on a -- um, the Trading Spaces, they had their worst shows --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they showed -- did you see that?
L:  No, I didn't see that one.
R:  It was for like two days. [NOISE] The ones that, you know, were really bombed and didn't turn out right and the people freaked out when they seen them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and ... [LAUGH] They showed em all, you know, for like twenty four hours, like a marathon type --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- deal or something.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  But it was -- that was funny.
L:  I think I saw one where they put like carpet squares on the wall --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- they were all [LAUGH] -- and I thought, "Why?".
R:  Or that one they glued moss to the walls.
L:  Oh, dear.  How would you ever clean that?
R:  That was like, "Oh, my gosh".
L:  No, I -- ah, that was way out.
R:  Yeah.  There- -- there's some of them that I'm just like, "If they said that designer was coming to do mine, I'd be like --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- 'I don't think so'" so.
L:  No.  No.  [MN] It would take you forever to get all that stuff off your walls.
R:  Oh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, some of them.  That one that they turned into a -- a theatre, it was terrible too.
L:  Oh.
R:  Ah, that was just silly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] But I don't know some of them if they would spend more time, [NOISE] they try to rush it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they just come up with [NOISE] something that wouldn't even work and put it together and start building that furniture out of plywood and stuff --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  They're not thinking -- you know, you gotta live with that stuff --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and, ah, some of it's pretty hard to do, in fact impossible.
R:  Yeah and when they start pain- painting their hardwood floors, I have a problem with that too.
L:  Oh, yes.  I would too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  No. [LAUGH] No, you wouldn't want to do anything with those
