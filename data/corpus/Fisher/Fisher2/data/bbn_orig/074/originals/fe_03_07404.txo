L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  Roxanne.
L:  Hi, my name's David.
R:  Hi.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine thank you.  And you?
L:  I'm doing fine.
R:  That's good.
L:  This is my first call.  How 'bout you?
R:  Um, this is my third call.
L:  Your third?
R:  Yes.
L:  So, you're an experienced veteran?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Kind of, yes.
L:  I think I -- I heard part of the topic.  I'm not sure about the whole thing.  But basically it was supposed to be like vices.
R:  Yes.  What do you consider is the worst habits?
L:  Yeah.  [LIPSMACK]  Any, uh, thoughts on your side?
R:  Well, um, I am a nonsmoker.  So, I cannot stand people who smoke.
L:  [LAUGH] I would agree.  Uh, I've just, uh, moved out to California and it was so nice to, uh, move here and realize I didn't have to ask for a non smoking section in a restaurant anymore.
R:  They just started that here also.
L:  Where you at?
R:  In Florida.
L:  Oh, in Florida?
R:  Yes.  They just started it.  So, it's like you don't have to worry about going into a restaurant and you sit down and -- and you're in the non -- the smoking section it's like they blow the smoke and it's so rude.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And it just permeates the air no matter where you're at unless they've got like a totally different walled off section.
R:  Yeah.  And ...
L:  I think that would probably be my -- my least favorite, like public, uh, vice.
R:  Mm.
L:  What were the other options they had?  Smoking.  They had alcohol.
R:  Gossiping.  Alcohol.  Overeating.  Not exercising.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, most of the other ones are just -- you know, they don't, uh, invade on my space, you know, like you were talking about with, you know, the -- the smell of it going around and everything.
R:  And people who go into your house and smoke.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, my gosh!  It's like thank you for not smoking.  Go outside if you wanna smoke --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- otherwise your upholstery stinks, your curtains.
L:  The clothes and everything.  Yeah.
R:  Your clothes.  Yes.
L:  I grew up, uh, with a father who was a heavy smoker and, uh, when my friends would come over and then go back to their homes their Moms would at times, and until they got used to it, asked them if they had been smoking --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- because the smell was so bad in our house that it just kinda clung to their -- their clothes and they smelt [LAUGH] like they'd just gone into --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- some alley somewhere and started smoking somewhere.  Yeah.  I -- I think just for that reason I would say that's my least favorite because it more than any of the other ones invades on other people's personal space and privacy and everything.
R:  Yes.  It's not like you -- you have the choice.  If you don't want to watch people drink you don't have to go to a bar and ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  But if you just go out to -- in public sometimes they're just lighting up and it's like okay --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- stay away from me.  It's gross. 
L:  Oh, yeah.  But I would say now -- if I'm saying that, uh, the personal invasion thing, I mean, I think that's why the whole drunk driving thing is such a big deal that it's not -- you're not just driving drunk, kill yourself --
R:  You're putting everybody else's life in danger.
L:  -- you're impacting other people if you have an accident, you know?  They -- they had no way to avoid you if you're drunk.  So ...
R:  Yes.  I agree on that completely also.
L:  So, I think, um, those two they're probably, you know, like first and second worst.  I mean, the other ones, not exercising ...  [LAUGH]
R:  That's the person's personal thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, overeating, you know, same thing.  I mean, they may be [LAUGH] out of shape and they may not live as long as a life as -- as, uh, otherwise but, um ...
R:  But you can't, uh, do it from second hand overeating.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You can't die from that if somebody gets behind the wheel after overeating.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  What they gonna do, burp at you?
L:  Unless they're eating while they're driving --
R:  Yes.  That's ...
L:  -- then -- then maybe.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's ...
L:  But that's not as bad, huh?
R:  People talking on cell phones when they're driving.
L:  Yeah.  That's ...
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  I think they were trying to outlaw both of those.  They should just outlaw anything --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- while you're driving other than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- maybe listening to the radio.
R:  Or just look straight ahead and drive.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  That's -- that's probably the safest way to go.
R:  Mm.
L:  But, um ...
R:  Down here it's [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yep.  So, I think, yeah, I'm glad -- I'm glad to hear -- I think New York was doing the same thing here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- outlawing it at least in the restaurants and bars.
R:  That's what they said they were going to do, yes, when I was up there.
L:  Did -- so -- so in Florida did they outlaw all public building smoking, or was it just in restaurants or ...?
R:  Just restaurants right now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it ...
L:  Well, here I think they even outlawed it in bars.  So, even if you do go out for a drink --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- which is kinda like the weird thing that, uh, people don't even -- they can't even smoke in there.
R:  Well, it makes life easier to breathe for everybody.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, I don't know what the, uh -- the public -- I don't -- they've -- they've done it here for quite a while I think the ...  You said Florida they just recently passed it?
R:  Yes, they did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think January they just passed it.
L:  Mhm.  And I think, uh -- the New York thing I think it's since Bloomberg took over, but they were talking about it, so within the last year or two.
R:  Yes, it was 'cause he took over two thousand and two.
L:  Mhm.
R:  January two thousand and two.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  So, it's pretty -- it's a pretty big deal though.  I mean, a lotta people will think that they're trying to curb their own personal choice in what they're doing, but I think that's just people that don't realize what an impact it has on everybody else that's around them.
R:  But you have to realize though second hand smoke kills.  It's not like you ask somebody to sit there and smoke in front of you or -- the little partitions they used to have in restaurants it was ridiculous.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's like the smoke can't go up and around the partition.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, they've, you know, found, um, like smoke particles on like fetus -- on the, you know, unborn babies.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, it's pervasive, I mean, when it's there.  I think that's, um -- and it just -- yeah, it just goes everywhere and it's -- at least the second hand is supposed to be worse than the, uh, first hand 'cause it's not filtered.
R:  That's exactly it.  At least you have a filter going in and out of your lungs.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like the people who, uh, wait tables and that.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah.  My -- and I -- my father who, like I said, was even a heavy smoker he said he didn't like second hand smoke --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and yet, you know, we'll be, uh, going on a car ride and he'd, uh, be smoking with the windows rolled up 'cause it was cold outside and ...
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]  [LAUGH]
R:  So, you guys were enjoying his cigarette with him, huh?
L:  What's that?
R:  You guys were enjoying his cigarette with him.
L:  Oh, yes.  Yes.  I think that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- why I just never really wanted to smoke growing up.  [LAUGH]  I had enough of it through that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, yeah ...  Were there any other options that they had?  We said ...
R:  Um, also gossip.
L:  Oh, gossip, yeah.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Same thing.  That is kind of annoying but, uh --
R:  It is, but ...
L:  -- everybody does it in one way or another.
R:  I think just sometimes -- I mean, like they have all these rag magazines and these talk shows and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where you find out who's, uh --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- with who and who had a child and duh, duh, duh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I actually wasn't even thinking of it like that.  But, uh, yeah, the Enquirer and all that kinda stuff.  So, I mean, there's gossip on so many different levels.  I was thinking more of like the workplace or, you know, school gossip --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that kind of thing where you have, uh, the different clicks and, um ...
R:  Yes.  Let's go start this one and that one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I mean, they hear from what's on television --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and what they read.
L:  Yeah.  It's -- but, yeah, I mean, it -- it can be annoying.  Everybody does it.  But again, like you say, I guess in a way that can -- that can hurt other people as much as -- I mean, emotionally, I mean, if it's untrue kinds of gossip and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, and everything, emotional damage rather than physical for the other ones.  But I don't think there's ever gonna be legislation [LAUGH] to stop gossip.
R:  I don't think so because the press will go out of business.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  But, I mean, you know, workplaces will try to curb -- they'll -- they'll have rules about, you know, what to talk about.  You can't talk about salary.  You can't talk about this or that.  And dating -- dating is probably the big thing that they'll, um --
R:  Yeah.  Try to stop.
L:  -- they'll try to stop dating and -- and, uh, that's -- that's probably one of the bigger, uh, subjects for gossip that go around.
R:  Yeah.  Who has, uh, been seen with who and duh, duh, duh.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  But, um, yeah, I'd have to say -- I -- I couldn't even remember that that was one of the options they gave.  I wouldn't -- that wouldn't pop up in my mind as one of the primary vices in the country or anything right now.
R:  No, I don't think so either.
L:  And I think -- well, alcohol is the only thing -- well, I guess other than smoking now that they've --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- passed the prohibition for a while trying to curb that.  But ...
R:  That didn't work.
L:  No.  No.  Yeah.  That's the problem with trying to legislate moral values [LAUGH] or something on other people.
R:  Yes.
L:  But, uh, I mean, I guess with drinking and driving, I mean, they can do certain aspects of it.  But again it always comes back -- it -- they're legislating --
R:  The choices.
L:  -- things that impact other people not yourself.
R:  Yes.  And the choices people make.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  Other than I guess drugs.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  I guess they can do -- they do say what drugs are illegal and people can't use them other than alcohol and nicotine.
R:  And those are the two of the most addictive drugs.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think there is a, uh -- there's a lot recently -- I think even in Canada recently they're talking about, um, legalizing like marijuana --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, trying to, you know, because of the black market people are still doing it and that causes a lot of problems and so they're -- at least maybe for that and maybe some other minor types of drugs they're trying to do something to curb it.  I don't know where I would stand on, uh --
