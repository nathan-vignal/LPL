R:  Hi, my name's Nancy.
L:  Yes, hello Nancy.  My name is Chancy.
R:  Did you understand what she said about the topic?
L:  Yeah, the topic is, uh, what should we do if anything about Iraq?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You know, Iraq, over -- over there where, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- where -- where we fought the Gul- -- uh, the Gulf War.  Well, not the Gulf War but the -- the most recent war.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Yes.
R:  You -- you want to go first?
L:  [SIGH] Well, oh, um, I haven't been watching the news much recently but, um, with what we've already done over there, I think definitely we should, uh, you know, uh stabilize -- finish stabilizing the area and let the, uh -- let the country, uh, form and put together their own government and -- and, uh, begin living their lives the way they should.
R:  I would agree with that. [MN] Why do you think we're over there in the first place?
L:  Well, um, what was, uh, President Bush's and all the other, uh, heads of, uh, states, uh, reasons?  Uh, because of the, uh, mass -- uh, weapons of de- -- of mass destruction that, uh, Saddam Hussein had and, uh, what -- and, uh, the other reasons.
R:  Right, right.  That was the publicized reason.  Uh, since we haven't found any yet, do you think that there was some hidden reason?
L:  Well, they -- they have found a few.  They haven't found, uh, as -- as many things, though as they, uh, thought that they would have by this time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, [MN] the -- the way that the country is designed and set up I'd imagine it probably is going to take another, uh, year before -- before they find, uh, a lot of what's over there because so many things are hidden, uh, underground in them bunkers and whatnot.
R:  Yeah.  I personally think that we did the right thing by going in with our troops.  Um, I'm not exactly sure that I believe the President in what he said about why we were going in.
L:  [SIGH] Well, the -- the President did, uh, his best job that he could to, uh, give the best reasons and -- and -- and do what, uh, you know, what -- what was best for the country and -- and still, uh, take care of the, uh -- the threat at hand.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, as I said, I believe that the -- I -- I was all for going in but the more that I read now about why the President presented it that way, um, I'm wondering if he was telling us the truth or if he was doing a PR job.
L:  Well, how much truth is the truth?  I mean, uh, no -- no -- not matter what they tell us, even if what they tell us -- let's say a hundred percent of what they tell us is the truth, they still haven't -- they're not telling us everything, they never tell us everything --
R:  True, that --
L:  -- because --
R:  That's very true.
L:  -- I mean, that's a -- it's a nat- -- it's a matter of national security.  If -- if everything was known, then we'd be at a -- a much greater risk than, uh, we are presently.
R:  [MN] Yeah, that's true, that's very true.
L:  So, I mean, they tell -- they try to keep a very tight lid on, uh, everything concerning, uh, Iraq and -- and any other country that we're involved with.
R:  It -- it seems [MN] -- it almost seems hopeless if you look at -- at the historical facts, how many years there has been fighting in the Middle East and is it ever going to end, ever, ever going to end?
L:  [LIPSMACK] That -- that's definitely a good question.  I -- I didn't tune into the news but I heard, you know, uh, the little brief ex- -- excerpts and they were talking about -- they were talking about his plan -- uh, his peace plan over there backfiring and I was wondering what that was about and, uh, did -- have -- have you heard recently?
R:  No, no, I did -- I didn't read anything in the papers today about what you're saying. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah, well there's -- they were probably just talking about, uh, you know, like -- like in any situation that you take, uh, two or three steps forward and you might have to take a step backwards and I'm sure that's what's happened in -- in some form or fashion.
R:  Yeah.  Another thing that -- that really disturbs me is the criticism that we're getting for not protecting the palaces over there, for not saving the valuable books.  It, um -- it -- it's criticism I don't believe that we deserve. [PAUSE]
L:  Um, I pro- -- I think I would agree with you there on -- on that part.  I -- I haven't heard recently much detail about, uh, uh, books and whatnot but I think we're doing the best that we can at preserving everything.  I would, uh, certainly hope so anyway.
R:  We went in to -- to liberate, uh, a people that were under oppression and, no, we can't -- we can't safeguard [LAUGH] all the artifacts in the country if we're going to concentrate on the people.
L:  Right.  Yeah, they -- they certainly do have a, uh -- a -- a policing issue or a -- a problem now that, uh, you know, there's just so -- I mean, just like -- like in our country or anyplace else, uh, if -- if there were -- if the majority of the people -- there -- there's always more people than there are government or officials and if there's more chaos going on -- or -- or if people decide to, uh, not be ruly or not be -- uh, not follow, uh, the laws, uh, the -- the government will have the ve- -- very difficult time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- handling or policing that situation.
R:  Yeah, true.  I -- I would like to see us a bit more aggressive and a bit more authoritarian in handling the -- the unrest that the country is showing now and I certainly don't believe that we should risk a -- risk any more of our -- our -- our soldiers' lives. [PAUSE]
L:  [LIPSMACK] Yeah, uh, [MN] hopefully, uh, not another life is going to, uh [SIGH] be taken from this earth any, uh, earlier than, uh, it needs to.  Um, you know, I -- my -- my prayers are certainly with our troops in that regard and, um, it -- it's just a unfortunate situation that, uh, anyone has to actually to -- to -- to save lives or to, uh, set up a government or -- or protect anyone that, uh, you know, it has to come to actual physical, uh, warfare.
R:  Yeah.  How -- how did you feel about the, um -- our citizens' protest against the war when we were -- after we had gone in?
L:  Well, I mean, um, I -- I, like my -- I mean, pro- -- protesting is good.  I mean, uh, everyone has a opinion and should be allowed to -- to voice how they feel.  Um, I myself, like many people, felt that I didn't want the war to go on, I didn't want us to have to go to Iraq and -- and -- and do what we had to do but, at the same -- on the same token, since we went ahead and did it and -- and we're over there, you know, I supported -- support the troops and support our country wholeheartedly.  It's just, uh, I -- I wish, if -- if there was a way for it to have been done without going to war that would have been the way that I'd preferred to do it but it, I guess, is -- there just didn't seem to -- that didn't seem to be possible.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Are -- what part of the country are you from?
L:  Uh,  well, I'm originally from Washington DC, uh, where -- where the -- where the White House is, uh, that's where I was born and raised, uh, but I've lived out here in California now for many years.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Over twenty years.
R:  I'm from southern California also.  Um, it -- it took a lot of our police force to control the protests that went out into the streets for -- after the war started and -- and I really resented that.  I didn't think that the protesters had the right to divert all of that police force from the protection of the citizens.
L:  Yes, well, uh, I think that was only for a short, brief period of time.  I mean, I don't think there's any protests going on presently --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- but, uh, you -- I -- I don't know if you're aware, there's been quite a number of our policemen in, uh -- I know in California, I don't know [MN] other states, who've had to actually go over there to Iraq to help, uh, with, uh, taking care of situations over there.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, I am aware.  I guess that -- that -- that's why I -- I resented the protestors, um, blocking the streets in Los Angeles to -- to do their protest because it -- that left the city rather -- well, it left the city defenseless in some areas because of the manpower.
L:  Certainly.
