L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Um --
R:  My name is Deborah[?].
L:  Hi, Deborah.  My name is Sonya[?].
R:  Hi.
L:  And where are you, Deborah?
R:  Um, I'm on Vancouver Island, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in the [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  Okay.  I know where you are.  I'm in Portland.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, we're not that far -- well, I guess that we're pretty far away --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- opposite ends.  Um --
L:  But the other people that I've talked to have been in Minnesota and one in, um, Nova Scotia, I believe. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's interesting.  This is my first call.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  [inaudible] I had a friend who was doing it and said, "You should do this". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um -- and Maryland is close to Washington DC, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I have a sister in law in Virginia.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  In Arlington.
L:  Oh, I know where that is too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Cool.  So, this is your first one, huh?
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Okay.  Well, the time -- you'll be surprised, the time passes very quickly.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  So, do you watch these shows?
R:  Um, I -- I sort of do, but I sort of don't.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my husband thinks they're really stupid --
L:  Uh-huh.  They are. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and, um -- yeah.  And so, you know, if he's around I won't watch it [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but because -- if the TV's on, chances are that he's watching it and, ah, because I don't have a lot of TV time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, if I'm home alone and he's gone with the kids, I'll probably throw it on and then, um -- and then I'll do some housework or something or fold laundry while I'm doing it --
L:  So, you kind of watch it the same way I do?  You watch it while you're doing something else at the same time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't have any time to just sit and watch TV.
L:  [LAUGH] I know how that one is.
R:  Just too busy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But they have an allure though, I don't know what it is.  They, ah -- um -- I mean, I think everybody thinks they're stupid and everybody [LAUGH] knows they're stupid, but everybody's watching, so.
L:  Well, I- -- I'm a school teacher and I notice that, ah --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- the day -- oh, are you really? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.  The day after one of these things has shown, everybody is talking about, "Well, gee -- ah, why did they boot so and so off?" and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "And who's going to win?" and you know?  I mean, it's -- it's almost like it's a game, I think.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, that -- that, ah feeling of -- of not knowing, you know?  Um -- I -- well, it's the same -- maybe it's the same kind of gratification you get when you play video terminals or you buy lottery tickets, you know?  The excitement of will you or won't you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  And then that reinforcement --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  The intermittent reinforcement that comes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, ah -- yeah, I'm just a substitute teacher.  I -- we moved to Vancouver Island from Northern BC --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I just can't get a job.  Um, I just got on a sub list so, um, I have more time on my hands than usual.  But ah -- yeah, it's -- um, the -- the shows are -- are definitely -- you know, they pose interesting scenarios and th- -- the way that they show the commercials on the TV make you wanna tune in [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, I think you're right about that.  It's always amazing to me that -- that people are willing to make themselves so vulnerable --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and to -- and to allow, you know, [LAUGH] -- kind of you into their life.
R:  That's the most amazing thing.  I mean, even a -- um, I don't watch the raunchy ta- talk shows, but if there's -- you know, even something like Dr Phil --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] when people are opening up like that.  It's like I -- I couldn't bare my personal, you know, demons on TV like that and -- and for people to expose themselves to being rejected on TV or, you know, hum- humiliated by Fear Factor or, um, you know, thrown off a -- an island.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That just -- I -- I guess the -- the possibility of a game is -- is -- is, you know, too alluring and it's hard to resist.
L:  I guess so.  Maybe it's the money, maybe it's the, "I want to win" thing.
R:  Yeah.  Maybe it's, "I wanna" --
L:  Um, I -- I don't know what it is.
R:  Maybe it's, "I wanna be famous and this is going to be my fifteen minutes".
L:  Well, I'll tell you the ones on the, um -- like The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, I don't know if you've watched any of those at all, but ...?
R:  I've just caught snippets here and there.
L:  Well, it's interesting because two or three of the people from each of them have gone on to be like, um -- ah, correspondents or something on some of the evening shows and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they come back repeatedly and -- and, ah, then others are -- are there and they have their fifteen minutes of fame and you never hear from em again.
R:  Yeah.  Um, in Canada we had one show where it was called The Lofter's and they put eight young adults in a loft in downtown Toronto --
L: Oh.
R:  -- and then they watched em.  And the girl's now a correspondent on TNN.  I mean -- not TNN, um, TST it's a sport -- ah, TSN --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- the sports network.  Um, Jennifer something --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and, ah, so it's kind of odd, you know, I -- I saw her crying on the coach over a boyfriend and now she's, you know, telling you how the -- um, how the hockey's going or whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, it's -- it's a different change of pace.
L:  Well, I kind of wonder if many of the, particularly, women that get into that are aspiring models or actresses and want to be seen --
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- get their face known and think, "Okay, maybe this will be a stepping stone -- stone to do something else".
R:  Yeah.  The only time I ever really followed it was the very first Survivor.  I don't know if it was summer or not, I don't even remember what time of year, but I seemed to have more time than usual and I did watch it and, you know, my husband teased me every time it was on.  And then after that I just -- it just -- I just didn't seem to have the time and, you know, if -- I think if you miss the first ones then you don't know the characters and you don't know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, what's going on.  Sort of like a soap opera, --
L:  Yeah, it is. [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, [several inaudible words].
L:  Very much like a soap opera. [LAUGH]
R:  My very first teaching job was Northern Manitoba which is right by, um, Hudson's Bay coast --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right near the top of Canada --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we had one channel and, um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the -- ah, my host was like a block from the school, it was right on the same compound and All My Children was on --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ah, at lunch time.  It was the only show that was on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I got to -- I watched All My Children [LAUGH] and I've never watched a soap opera before and I've never watched one [LAUGH] since, but once you get out of it and you don't know the characters then it's -- it's boring.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?  [several inaudible words] care about, so.  I think --
L:  Well, I know that people in my neighborhood have Survivor parties --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and they -- on the night that the Survivor's going to be on, they all show up at one person's house and they have dinner and they have a few drinks and they [LAUGH] watch the thing and they, you know, give it a total like, ah, you know, commentary [LAUGH] the- [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there is five or six of them that get together all the time and it's -- it's couples.  It's not just the women, it's [LAUGH] the guys too.
R:  Right.  I'm amazed at the amount of press that it gets.  You know?  Who won and who got out and, um, you know, who -- who will she propose to and, you know, it seems to be -- I mean, with all the things that are happening in the world, you'd think they'd find something, you know, more substantial to report on. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, maybe it's something like -- it's -- to -- to me it's a hoot to watch em.  I mean, I -- I watch em and -- and laugh and think, "Oh, how is stupid is this?" you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And it's almost like escapism, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, the one thing that I was realising was, um, a few years ago they used to have -- um, they would show you snippets of Japanese television, the game shows and things and they just seemed so bizarre and so wacky and, you know, it sort of made me think, "Well, gee those people are, you know, different from us [LAUGH] because --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- you know, they're -- they have such crazy shows" and now our TV's becoming like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  With all these wacky scenarios and these [NOISE], you know, crazy stunts and people doing, you know, dangerous things for money.  So, it's -- we're not so different after all.
L:  No, I guess it mu- -- might be human nature just to do crazy things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, who knows? [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  Would you ever do it?
R:  No.  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm shy.  But I wouldn't -- um, we hav- -- we haven't had too many, um, of the reality shows in Canada.  Um, the reality shows that we have had more of are putting people into a historical context and then seeing how they do.  Um --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- we had one where they set up people, um, with the same equipment that settlers would have had and then they put them on a plot of land that had -- you know, was not cleared or had no services or anything and said, "There you go, make a farm" and then they watched them all year.  And so we've had those kind of reality shows and those ones interest me a lot more than, you know, the kind of crazy ones.
L:  They're actually accomplishing something instead of just being --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ridiculous.  Mhm.
R:  The last one that I watched [NOISE] from start to finish was called Quest For The Bay and Hudson's Bay, I don't if -- or what you know about geography [several inaudible words] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Hudson's Bay is right, sort of, between Quebec and -- and then Ontario and Montreal --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, pardon me, Manitoba and the fur traders used to come on big ships into Hudson's Bay --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- and they'd collect the furs and the voyagers would bring the furs up on the -- the water systems in Manitoba up to the bay.  And so, they had one called Quest For The Bay where they said, "You're voyagers and here's the boat they'd use and this is the amount of cargo they'd have and this is, you know, exactly what they'd eat and go for it".
L:  Hm.
R:  And, you know, it was such an arduous journey and they -- they made six shows out of it and it --
L:  Well --
R:  -- that was really interesting and --
L:  It sounds like the Canadians are a little bit more, um, what -- what word do we want to use here?  A little bit more sophisticated or a little bit more high brow than Americans as far [LAUGH] as what they'll watch.
R:  Well, I don't about -- I don't know about that, but -- um, maybe it's because we don't have the same kind of money available to make shows --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- and a lot of it is funded by the government and by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, so they sort of have maybe loftier goals than [LAUGH] someone who's just looking to make money.  I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, American TV is certainly out there to make money.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, that's pretty evident.  I mean, there's stations here too that are like that, but I think the majority of -- of the money available in Canada is from the CBC and --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- some, you know, funded by government, so maybe that's why.  But you know, I -- I do enjoy those and I've taped some of them in case I taught that g- -- you know, the voyagers and -- and how they took the furs up to, um, Hudson's Bay is -- is, yeah, a great
