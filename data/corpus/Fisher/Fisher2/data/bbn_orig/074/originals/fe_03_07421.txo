R:  Hey, what's up?
L:  Hi. [LAUGH]
R:  Who's this?
L:  This is Sarah.  Who's this?
R:  This is Carissa[?].
L:  Very cool.  Where are you from?
R:  I am from Washington State.
L:  [LAUGH] No way, me too. [LAUGH]

L:  We're in Washington [inaudible] -- I'm from Seattle.
R:  Oh, I'm in Kirkland.
L:  Oh, right on.  That's very cool.
R:  That's cool.  Very cool.
L:  [LAUGH] Scary.
R:  That's funny.
L:  Anyway ...  So, um, we're supposed to talk about personal habits and what we think is the worst --
R:  Right.  [several inaudible words] --
L:  And your opinion is ...? [LAUGH]
R:  Well, they left like all these options and stuff and so some of them like, as far as like what's worst for other people or like what's worst for you --
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  -- you know?  [several inaudible words] gossip doesn't necessarily hurt you so much --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but I mean, it is not a good idea as far as keeping other people in mind, but um -- yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Right.  What do you think?
L:  Indeed.  I'm of the opinion that that would be the worst, simply because it drags other people in.
R:  Right.
L:  If you're doing something to yourself that's pretty bad, but at the same time it's your life.
R:  Right.
L:  Indeed. [LAUGH]
R:  This is true.  Like, yeah, of all the things, as far as like what's worst for you, I'd say maybe like drugs and alcohol and stuff.
L:  Yes, absolutely.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  Because -- I mean, you can be fat but you're -- it's not killing yourself, right? [LAUGH] You know what I mean.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  So, I mean, not --
L:  I think so. [LAUGH]
R:  -- not super healthy but ah --
L:  Depending ...
R:  -- on the scale of like one to ten, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things that are [inaudible].  Good deal.
L:  Indeed.  I'd be inclined to agree, but gossiping is definitely not a good thing to do to people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- trauma is bad.
R:  Because we're supposed to ta- -- I think it's funny --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that we're supposed to talk abou this for eight minutes and they give you one question and they're like, "Okay, answer this question" and you're like, "Okay.  Answered it.  All right.  Very Good. --
L:  I know.
R:  "-- talk for eight minutes".
L:  Well, sometimes they give you a topic that's like pretty opened ended [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and sometimes they don't. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [several inaudible words] --
R:  Well, last time I did it, they had like five or six different questions that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you could talk about.  And they weren't even like questions, they were like, "Discuss different things, like about this" --
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  -- and there was like five different things and it was like, "Okay.  Well, that's cool" you know?
L:  What were the topics?
R:  Ah -- well, it was talking about like activities and like whether you prefer outdoor activities --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- or indoor activities and different kinds of sports and what your favorite kind of sport is and do you like to participate or watch sports and different stuff [MN] so.
L:  Cool.  Cool.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Indeed.
R:  So --
L:  So, you live in Kirkland, that's pretty cool.
R:  I live in Kirkland.  Yeah, I live at North West College, so.
L:  Oh, that's awesome. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.

L:  Indeed.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Are you going to school over there or ...?
L:  Yeah, I go to U. Dub[?].

R:  That's cool.
L:  Definitely nice.
R:  What are you majoring in?
L:  Um, I don't know, I was going to do computer engineering but now I think I'm doing communications.
R:  That's cool.

R:  Do you know what you want to do with your life and your --
L:  -- some really cool people.  Um --

R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.  What about you?
R:  Good deal.  I um --

R:  -- going into my senior year and, um, I am a youth ministry major --
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  -- so, I want to be a youth pastor.  Yeah.
L:  That's good.
R:  So.
L:  That's really awesome.
R:  I like it, it's fun, so. [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Indeed.  So, do you like living in Kirkland?
R:  Um, I do.  It's a little bit -- I'm from Paulsville[?], do you know where that's at?
L:  Oh.  Yeah, I was just there for a party like a couple of weeks ago. [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Yeah.
L:  That's really funny.
R:  Yeah.  So, I'm originally fr- -- well, not originally, I've moved around the country a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but like the last ten years or so have been in Paulsville --
L:  Very cool.
R:  -- and, um, so there's like -- ah, there's Paulsville and there's like Bainbridge Island and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like Bainbridge Island is like the upscale, posh like kind of snotty --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- area of Kitsap County and Kirkland is like the Bainbridge Island of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it really is.  I grew up in Belleview[?] and that was pretty bad, but like the Kirkland kids were always like way more stuck up than we were.  It was really funny.
R:  Right.  Well --
L:  They'd go cruising in their convertibles down like The Strip in Kirkland. [LAUGH]
R:  Right. Right. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Indeed. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  So, Kirkland is -- is by far [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, but it's on the water and it's really pretty.  It's a nice part.
R:  It is.  Yeah.
L:  Definitely.
R:  So -- and in the school like you can see the water and --
L:  Yeah, that's really awesome.
R:  -- and that's really cool.  So, I get [several inaudible words] --
L:  Definitely.
R:  And I'm liking school a lot because um, there's not a lot of people who go here, it's like less than a thousand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people and so --
L:  And that's always really nice.
R:  -- kind of know each other and it's cool and like know everybody on campus and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like -- ah, your own little city, but you know everybody.
L:  That's always nice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I always went to really small high schools.  Um, I went to the International School which is like an alternative school with like four hundred kids from grade six through twelve --
R:  Dang. [LAUGH]
L:  -- so everyone really knew each other there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then I went to boarding school in Canada [LAUGH] --
R:  Craziness.
L:  -- which is where you live with like four hundred people [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and like -- so you know everybody's business. [LAUGH] But it's nice.
R:  Why did you decide to go to boarding school?
L:  Um, because I just thought it would be a really exciting experience.  Like, I really -- um, I was doing rowing really heavily at the time --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the s- -- I went up to a regatta at the school and they happened to be like national champions in Canada --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- um -- so, I wanted to go and do that program and also I just really wanted to like go see the world a little bit and I, ah, had this fixation on boarding school because I thought it'd be really neat.
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah, I like read too much Harry Potter or something.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  But it's pretty great though.
R:  I really wanted to go to boarding school when I was in junior high, actually I think it -- this was back -- I used to be a wiccan, do you know what a wiccan is?
L:  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I do.
R:  Yeah.  I used to be a wiccan and, um, back when I was a wiccan like I really wanted to go to boarding school and I think it was because I was reading all these books about like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- people who go to these boarding school for -- li- -- it wasn't Harry Potter but it was -- I think this was like pre Harry Potter --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like boarding schools and people have these magic powers or like they go to a regular boarding school and they're just like the group of people with magic power and --
L:  Oh, that's really -- oh, that's hilarious.
R:  -- or the group of witches [LAUGH] and so like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] go to boarding school, that'd be so [several inaudible words].
L:  It's really not that cool.  Like, I thought it was going to be like Dead Poet's Society or something really neat like that, you know, the whole boarding school thing?
R:  Right.
L:  But -- like there was this one time when I was watching that movie with a friend of mine --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- in the middle of, like, our common room in our boarding house and she said, "Oh, I want to go to boarding school" and [several inaudible words] "We were already there" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but it's like a completely different experience than in the movies.
R:  Right.
L:  Like sometimes it's exactly like that but like there isn't any like strange adventure or anything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for the most part. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  There's some secret passages usually, but [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- aside from that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nothing too cool.
R:  That's cool.  So, now do you live in the dorms at the U Dub or [several inaudible words] have an apartment?
L:  No.  No, I have an apartment.  I lived in dorms for two years and then decided I sort of like wanted to not do that anymore --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- for awhile, so.
R:  So, is living like in a college dorm kind of similar to boarding school where you live and go to school --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- [several inaudible words]?
L:  -- I think it is.  I believe like being in a college, experiencing -- like when I was in high school and I did like a summer program --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but it's a lot like that.  Like it's just nice to have your own like kitchen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and your own bathroom and not have to worry about like walking down the hall all the time and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  Yeah, because like -- yeah, for the summer --
L:  It's definitely nice.
R:  -- because I'm on campus for the summer, um, the cafeteria's closed and so --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- we don't have like kitchens because I'm in the dorm and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so I get like my own quasi[?] kitchen in my room, but like I have to walk down the hall if I want a sink or something --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- like that.  I just want my own sink. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, it's little things like that -- that like you really miss and after two years of that it is better but I definitely wanted my own place for a little while --
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  -- but there are definitely fun things that happen in the dorm.  Like it's nice to always have other people around --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- especially if you're taking like difficult classes or something.
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because I'm living in an apartment next year and they're on campus apartments so that's cool because they're still --
L:  Oh, that is really cool.
R:  -- people who I'm going to school with are all in the apartments around me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but like I have my own kitchen [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, that's nice --
R:  -- and my own sink. [several inaudible words]. [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, definitely.
R:  So.
L:  Best of both worlds.
R:  Yes, that'll be cool.
L:  Yes.
R:  But then I was thinking about it, like -- then there's like all the extra stupid stuff you have to pay for like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have to buy your own vacuum or you have to like buy like stuff -- [several inaudible words] cleaning stuff to like clean your house or your apartment --
L:  I know.  Yeah.
R:  -- instead of just like having it there, you know?
L:  I managed to like snag all that from my parents --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which was very convenient, because they live close. [LAUGH]
R:  That's cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Good deal.
L:  Definitely nice --
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  -- as opposed to like being out of state and having nothing. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah, my room mate this last year was from Idaho and so like --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- she like -- all her stuff was always far away and I'm just like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "I don't understand" so.  Yeah, because I work for a youth ministry that's in Paulsville too, so I commute back and forth --
L:  Oh, wow that's like intense.
R:  -- um, twice a week, so.  And my parents live in Paulsville, well, one of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one set of my parents live in Paulsville.  Um, my mom and step dad live in Paulsville.  So, like I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- can go over there and seem them and bug them and [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
L:  The ferry over there's really pretty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We went over there like sort of at the beginning of like the nice weather --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it was really, really nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I like it, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really -- it's really pretty and I really like -- because on Tuesday nights --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'll, um -- I'll come back really late after our service --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so it'll be like I'll catch the eleven thirty five and so coming into Seattle at like midnight and it's like you've got all the lights [several inaudible words] --
L:  Oh, I know it's so gorgeous.
R:  -- really cool.
L:  That area of Seattle is so nice at night --
R:  Yeah, I like it a lot.
L:  -- all the lights.  Definitely.
R:  A lot.  A lot.
L:  Indeed.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  So, do you know where you want to work after you get out?
R:  Um.  Well, there -- because I'm working for this youth ministry and we -- we're the largest youth ministry in our denomination on the west coast --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- so, we're really big and, um -- so, they might be able to hire somebody else, because right now they have two youth pastors and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, two internship directors and a high school director and so I think -- what I want to do is be the assistant junior high youth pastor or --
L:  That'd be realy nice.
R:  -- um, be a discipleship pastor and like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- run -- like oversee like small groups and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I'd like to do that for Legacy[?], which is the youth ministry I work for or kind of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- work for.  Um -- I mean, if that doesn't work then I probably want to just go to a church somewhere, either in the Puget Sound area or southern California.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So.  I want to stay on the west coast though. [MN]
L:  Yeah, the west coast is really nice. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah and interstate -- well -- and my dad's in the coastguard, so like when we were moving around --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- when I was little, like, we were always by water and so like I've gotten a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- fixation with being near water --
L:  I know --
R:  -- like [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- when I lived in Canada we were right on the water, like twenty feet away from the beach --
R:  That's cool.
L:  -- and now I like can't handle not being right on it. [MN]
R:  Right.
L:  I don't
