L:  Hi, this is Mike.
R:  Hi, Mike.  I'm Alice.
L:  Hi, Alice.
R:  Hi.
L:  It took a little bit for me to get connected there.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  I thought maybe I was even disconnected.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I just dialed and it had dialed out.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I appreciate that.  It kept me, uh, uh, from, you know ...?
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  So, what's our topic?  It's which -- which is worse?
L:  Here's -- here's what it says on the website.
R:  Oh, you looked for that?  Right.
L:  Yeah.  I took a printout of all the questions.
R:  Okay.
L:  It says number thirty six, personal habits.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  According to each of you which is worse -- gossiping, smoking, drinking alcohol or caffeine excessively, overeating or not exercising?
R:  Hm.  [LIPSMACK] Well, gosh!  [LAUGH]  What do you think?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, uh, it really depends on what -- what light that you wanna shed on it.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean ...
R:  Right.  If you're talking what d- does the most damage to other people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then that might be gossip, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Or -- or from a -- yeah, f- from a spiritual sense, yeah --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause it's -- I'm a Christian, that's what they --
R:  Oh, I am too.
L:  -- they say in the Bible, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- beware of the gossips and all that and ...
R:  Right.  Definitely.  Definitely.  So, that could be the most harmful definitely.
L:  That could be the most harmful spiritually I think.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Unless you try to ...
L:  But then again, you know, excessive use of alcohol well --
R:  Well, correct.  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that may influence your personal habits toward an unspiritual end too.
R:  That's true too.  Yeah.
L:  So, um, you know, I -- I think there's two different realms we need to speak of here --
R:  Right.  Right.  If you're talking ...
L:  -- and that's spiritually and physically.
R:  Right.  If you're talking physically then well, gosh, they're all bad.  I mean, all of the physical ones are bad for you -- smoking.  I just watched my mother die from smoking.
L:  Oh, heavens.
R:  So, you know, that's just awful, you know?
L:  Excuse me here while I blow my nose.  [NOISE]
R:  Okay.  [COUGH]  I'll cough while you're blowing ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  Now we're even.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, yeah, and -- and of course smoking affects the people around you too because of second hand.  So, that makes that one even worse.
L:  Yeah.  And I'm a heavy smoker myself.
R:  Oh, you are?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  And they say that, uh -- and of course both of my parents were smokers when I was growing up --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they say that smoking and that's -- that's I guess the most harmful thing about smoking, they say that children of parents, uh, who -- who smoke, uh, they do not have a fifty percent greater chance of smoking, they have a fifty percent chance of smoking.
R:  Oh, really?  Huh.
L:  So, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and as a matter of fact my eighteen year old is, uh -- is addicted to cigars now.
R:  Oh, really?  Wow!
L:  And I -- I come ...
R:  Well, see, both of my parents smoked and there was five of us kids and I was the only one that didn't grow up to smoke.
L:  Yeah.  And I -- you know, I cough and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, especially in the morning I'm always coughing stuff up --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and I keep on saying, you know, "Hey, if you wanna be like me --" you know?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  But then again, you know, my Dad was a two or three pack a day s- smoker and he's gone through, uh, I think eight strokes and two heart attacks and he -- and of course he's saying ...  Are you still there?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  He's saying, um ...  I'm get- -- I'm getting a little whistle tone in the -- my earpiece.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], he's -- he's saying, "Do you wanna end up like me, all stroked up and stupid now?"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't take his advice and of course my son doesn't take my advice.  So ...
R:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, yeah, I don't know how I never ended up smoking.  I -- I don't -- I mean, at the time when I -- I guess made that choice my Mom wasn't even sick from it so -- but I just never did.  But my brothers all did.
L:  Yeah.  And that's -- that's -- that's quite true because, um, when I started smoking both my -- my, uh, folks were --
R:  Were they?
L:  -- were okay, you know, and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my grandmother smoked until her death and --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- you know, natural causes and, um --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I thought well -- and I al- -- I also heard in a sc- -- one of these scientific studies you hear about in the news that there's a smoking gene.  So, I though hey, you know, my family's smoking and they're not doing too bad.  So --
R:  Right.  Huh.
L:  -- we must not have the smoking gene, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But now I get ch- chronic bronchitis every year that leads to pneumonia at the drop of a hat.
R:  Right.  Yeah.  I've been getting that, like I -- oh, gosh, probably about ten, twelve years ago I started getting it once a year, um, and I -- and I -- I don't know if it's from being around it so much, even though, you know, I don't live with it now on a daily basis but, um, I seem to have broken that.  I started exercising more and stuff a couple of years ago and now I don't tend to get the bronchitis as much and I don't know it's 'cause I'm living a healthier lifestyle or what.
L:  Well, what city are you from or what ...?
R:  I live -- I live in the northwestern, Portland.
L:  Mm.
R:  Oregon.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um ...
L:  Well, um, you know, that has the same sorta weather and I know what kinda weather, um -- I -- I live in Nashville --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  -- and I know that, uh -- I know if it gets -- if there's a, uh -- like, uh, about a month and a half ago there was a cold front and a warm front and a cold front --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and a warm front, they move through, and I know that's just prime time for bron- bronchitis and sure enough I got it.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, you know, being out in the west there I -- I believe you're -- you're, uh, weather's kinda similar to, um [LIPSMACK], the Seattle area kinda.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  So, it's kinda hot, cold and damp --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and hot and cold and damp and hot and cold and damp.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's prime season -- that's prime season for bronchitis --
R:  Yeah.  It probably would be.
L:  -- that's for sure.
R:  Well, I know this year I -- actually just a couple of -- a week or so ago I actually did come down with kind of a summer cold, but it didn't turn into bronchitis, which it used to always, and now it didn't.  So, I'm kinda hoping that I've broken that, um -- kinda that -- I don't know.  It just seemed to be a yearly thing for four, five, six years.  But maybe it's not gonna happen now.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I would say smoking is one of the -- the worst evils that you can have.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, not off topic but, um, you know, 'cause this is regarding smoking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but one of the things that I've found that really, uh, cures my bronchitis due to smoking is Biaxin.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  B.I.A.X.I.N.  It's a -- it's a big elephant gun of an antibiotic --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it's made for -- for respiratory infections.
R:  I think -- is that the one the I.C. commercial's for?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, it's not.  Okay.
L:  [LIPSMACK] I don't think so and of course I'm not there in Portland.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, which would you consider the worst, uh, physically -- smoking, drinking, caffeine, or eating or not exercising?
R:  Oh, gosh!  [LAUGH]  [COUGH]  Well, like I said, they each do their damage that's for sure and [LIPSMACK] I probably suffer more from overeating personally than the others 'cause I don't drink at all, I never have smoked, and I don't drink coffee.  [LAUGH]  So, but, um ...
L:  Well, I would think so too.  Um, I think overeating is really one of the worst vices you can have because, you know, when you quit drinking or you quit smoking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you could just quit.
R:  Right.
L:  But you just can't quit food.
R:  Oh, that's -- and I think that's what also makes it so hard, you know?  You -- you can't give it up so you have to learn to deal with it on a moderate -- you know, on a -- you know, in moderation which, you know, if you -- like if you have a problem with alcohol then they don't say do that.  They say give it up entirely, you know?  Where with smok- -- um, like you said, food you have to eat.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  And every time you eat there's the tempt- temptation to overeat --
R:  That's right. 
L:  -- and it's j- -- I think it's just as much of a --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- comfort drug as -- as, uh, you know, uh, al- alcohol or whatever.
R:  Yeah, it probably is.
L:  It's -- it's really -- it's -- at that point it -- it is a drug.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It -- it releases those, um, chemicals in your body and they give you the feeling of comfort.
R:  Right.
L:  And so I think that ...
R:  Yeah, especially like if it's chocolate they say chocolate has that.  Well, I don't know -- some substance in it that does all that stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's funny my wife, uh, she's allergic to smoke and she's, uh, overweight right now and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's kinda funny because she'll say, you know, "You better stop smoking, you know, it's gonna kill ya".
R:  Mhm.
L:  But meanwhile she's gotten now complications due to her -- her weight.
R:  Right.
L:  She's got high blood pressure and a heart condition and all that stuff --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's all just because, you know, that -- that -- that -- our heart is as big as a muscle and it's trying to pump blood through all that -- that stuff.
R:  Right.  Oh, definitely.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  So -- so definitely each of those things -- I guess probably what it amounts to is anything in excess really does us harm, even things that wouldn't be bad -- you know, prob- probably alcohol by itself isn't bad if it wasn't done in -- like, you know, if it was done in moderation.
L:  Well put.
R:  Um, but smoking of course probably isn't good even in moderation.  But, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but -- and -- but we know food is good for us [LAUGH] in modera- -- at least the good food -- for us.  But even the bad food probably in moderation wouldn't be terrible, you know?  Of course the bad food you can't eat in moderation anyway.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it's like they said, nobody over -- overeats on celery and vegetables, you know?  [LAUGH]  You know?  We overeat on chocolate and salty things.
L:  Yeah.  So, I would say -- yeah, I mean, if I had to answer this question and I had to pick one --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I would say smoking obviously 'cause of the risk of cancer.
R:  Right.
L:  But really if -- if I -- if it was an open ended question I would say smoking is on a tie with, uh -- with overeating.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, they certainly both have caused so many different problems, you know?  Like you said they cause the high blood pressure -- or the eating does and, you know, can lead to diabetes, you know, it can just really complicate your life.
L:  And they say drinking alcohol, um -- they said -- as a matter of fact I just heard on a news story only last night for women --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that -- I don't know whether they -- they picked it up there in Portland, but they -- they said two drinks -- they -- they had a study of, uh -- they gave, uh, women two drinks --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, a day and, uh, that was supposed to, um, lower the risk of a number of things.  I think it was like heart attacks that -- that sort of thing.
R:  Yeah.  I've heard something along those lines before too.
L:  Or -- it -- it was diabetes.
R:  Oh, is it diabetes?
L:  It was diabetes that's right.
R:  Ah.
L:  But they said of course, you know, more than two doubles your chance of diabetes.
R:  Oh, you've gotta hit just that right number.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I guess -- I guess two is okay.  Three is -- three is a no no.
R:  [LAUGH]
