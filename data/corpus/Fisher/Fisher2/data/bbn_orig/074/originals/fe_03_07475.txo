R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Adam.  How are you?
L:  Hi, I'm Amy.
R:  Hi, how're you doing?
L:  Good.
R:  Oh, you've done this before?
L:  No, I haven't.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Have you?
R:  Yep, my third time.
L:  Cool.
R:  Uh, basically we just have to talk for ten minutes on the topic that they gave us.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, they told us about disarmament of Iraq and what we should be doing.  You want to start, want me to start?
L:  Uh, go ahead.
R:  Oh, okay.  Uh, well, I assume they just want us to, uh [SIGH] discuss what we feel about what the US has done in terms of disarming Iraq and what we need to do now and, uh, I agree we needed to go in when we went in and I think before we leave we have to make sure that there's some type of stability there otherwise the wrong people will get into control again.  Uh, basically for our own safety and every -- the world -- the rest of the world's safety because I believe that [SIGH] there probably is stuff there that we just haven't found yet that they would use to, uh, destroy or do stuff to other people.
L:  I'm not really that familiar with it.
R:  Oh.
L:  I haven't been watching the news that much.
R:  Oh, um --
L:  So ...
R:  Well, they -- they've -- they've had the in -- the, uh, inspections and, uh, Iraq wasn't complying with the, uh, United Nations required inspections and, uh, the United States felt that there was more there that the United Nations wasn't seeing [NOISE] and so that's when we decided to go into Iraq.  And now that we're in Iraq we haven't found any, uh, weapons of mass destruction.  I thought it -- I think they probably just hid them very well and, uh, we have to, like, I think, find them before we leave otherwise the wrong people will get their hands on it. [PAUSE] Uh, um, you've heard about some of that stuff, I'm assuming?
L:  Yeah.  Has -- so have they found any at all?
R:  Huh?
L:  Have they found any at all, then?
R:  No --
L:  No?
R:  -- they haven't.
L:  Hm.
R:  No.
L:  Yeah, they're probably just hidden.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  They must -- but some people probably think they don't exist at all but I don't believe that at all.
L:  Yeah.  I listened to, uh, President Bush's State of the Union address and he -- I was listening to how he went through that list of everything they -- they did have, they don't know what happened to it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so I think they have to have some of that over there still.
R:  Yeah, just wish we could find it soon, uh, 'cause all those people who didn't want us to go to war are saying, "See, there's nothing there, so there's no point in us going to war" but, uh, it's, I think, a matter of time before we find it 'cause we're unfamiliar with the country and all the hiding places and they know where to hide the stuff.  And since we don't even know if Saddam Hussein is dead, he -- he hid it in places where he'll be able -- if he -- if he's alive he'll be able to get to if we don't get to him.
L:  Mm.
R:  So I think he's still keeping the stuff there and, uh, it's very important for us to get to it and get rid of it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I still think he's alive, [LAUGH] too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just a matter of -- matter of time and hopefully, uh, it won't cost us any more lives 'cause we're trying to protect so many.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Have you heard anything else about it?
L:  No, not really.
R:  Oh, okay.  Um, so you don't really follow the current events about this stuff?
L:  No, I don't really.
R:  Oh, but --
L:  I don't follow at all.
R:  Oh, okay.  And where're you from?
L:  Uh, Illinois.
R:  Oh, okay.  We're -- I'm in New York.
L:  Oh.
R:  Let's see -- so you heard about this study over the internet?
L:  The what?
R:  The study that they're doing, this call, you got it from the internet or friend of yours?
L:  Yeah, um, I heard about it on a website that I'm on.
R:  Mhm, I see.  Yeah, a friend of mine sent me the email about it.  Uh, hm, anyway we gotta speak for ten minutes, we got a while -- ways to go.  I don't even --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- think we're halfway through.  Uh, let's see what else we can talk about in terms of this topic?  Uh, you agree we should have gone into Iraq?
L:  Yeah, I think that we should have.  I mean, if there's something there we should do something about it.
R:  Yeah, I think so, too.  I'm glad we didn't listen to the United Nations 'cause, uh, Saddam could have done something with, uh, his weapons of mass destruction.  I think the United Nations is just a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- totally superfluous, uh, organization.  I don't really think they have a, uh -- [LIPSMACK] they play a role in world peace, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they just, uh -- they're looking at the, uh, world through rose colored glasses so I'm glad we went in and, uh, hopefully, uh, we -- we'll get everything that we need and be able to get out of there quickly. [PAUSE] Uh, uh, you have anything you want to say on the topic?
L:  [NOISE] Um, not really.  Like I said, I don't -- I don't know that much about it.
R:  Oh.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Huh, okay, think we got like another four minutes to go.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] Having nice weather there?
L:  Uh, it's kinda humid right now.
R:  That's that we have had rain most of the day --
L:  We just --
R:  -- here in New York.
L:  We just turned the air conditioning on.
R:  Oh, haven't done that yet but, uh, it's cooled it off a little bit.  It's like about seventy degrees here now.  Had been eighty so it cooled off a little bit.  It's not as humid as it has been. [PAUSE] [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay, another like four, three, four minutes, I think.  What else shall we say about this topic?  Um [PAUSE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Well, it's unfortunate that we've lost many lives.  Um, do you know people who are there fighting?
L:  Uh, no, I don't.
R:  Oh, I know a few there.  I have a cousin of mine there, not even sure where he is, and I have a friend also stationed somewhere there. [PAUSE] One of my friends, he -- he's been over there since, uh -- actually he left this country since -- he left at nine eleven, right after, like, day after or two days later.
L:  Mm.
R:  He had to go out there and, uh, he's come back twice.
L:  [MN]
R:  Each time for I think either seven or fourteen days, uh, but he's back there again.  Sometimes I see him online but I haven't seen him online in a few weeks now so I guess he's very busy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And my cousin I haven't seen --haven't heard from him in probably two months. [PAUSE] Yeah, hopefully they're okay, everybody's okay over there. [PAUSE] Uh, and hopefully we won't have to go to any other nations but you never know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- uh, 'cause of, you have Iran, they might have weapons and then we know that, uh, India and Pakistan have and then we have, uh, what is it, North Korea now has?  Yeah, North Korea has also.  And they've threatened to use it, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's a dangerous world we live in.
L:  Yes, it is. 
R:  Yeah, hopefully, uh, things should just get better and, uh, these, uh, tyrants who are -- who are running these countries will be out of control shortly. [PAUSE] Yeah. [PAUSE] Uh, let's see. [PAUSE] So you agree with everything the President has done in this -- in this instance with going in there and the way we've handled it? [PAUSE] Yeah?
L:  Um, yeah, I think that he's --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- doing the right thing.
R:  Hm?
L:  Yeah, I think he's doing the right thing. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  Oh, you have a lot of people where you are?
L:  What's that, I'm sorry?
R:  There are a lot of people where you are?  I hear a lot of noise.
L:  Um, kind of where I live in there's about, uh, forty thousand people.
R:  Uh-huh.  I was saying where you -- where you are right now.  You live with a few other people?
L:  I'm -- I'm sorry?  I'm having troubling hearing ya.
R:  Oh.  Is there a lot of people where you are, in the room you are in?
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Oh.
L:  Just me and my husband.
R:  I see.
L:  Having trouble hearing ya, I'm --
R:  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  My -- I think it's my phone.
R:  Oh, I can hear ya. [PAUSE] I think we got like another -- 'nother minute or two, I think.  Yeah, ten minutes is sometimes -- sometimes go by quickly, sometimes not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Sometimes it seems like an eternity. [PAUSE] Oh, so you have two more questions to answer.  They only -- I think they only call three times. [PAUSE] Huh. [PAUSE] They'll let us know -- they let you know when it, uh -- you, only have a few seconds to go and then they just end it. [PAUSE] Let's see ...
