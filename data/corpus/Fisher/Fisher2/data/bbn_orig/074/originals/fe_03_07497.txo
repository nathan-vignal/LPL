L:  -- St Patrick's Day.  I always just loved the, ah, --
R:  Right.  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] happy atmosphere.
R:  It'd be great.  [NOISE]
L:  Everyone just -- just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- everyone's friendly and talking and, you know, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- going into New York City for the p- parade.  [SIGH] --

R:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I guess.  [LAUGH]  [SIGH]
R:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]  If I could invent a holiday I don't know what it would be.  [NOISE]

R:  I don't know  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I don't know.
R:  I don't know what I'd do.  [NOISE]
L:  'Cause you know what, whenever there's not a holidays w- we just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- g- get together for barbecues [LAUGH] a- anyway --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and stuff, you know, so we always try to --
R:  Cook outs, yeah --

R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a- ah, what goes on 'cause both sides of the family are up here.  [SIGH]  And, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, it should be interesting whether we come home or -- we c- can't have everybody d- down but, um, --
R:  Yeah, moving is [NOISE] kind of tricky.
L:  Yes.
R:  How old are your kids?  [NOISE]

R:  N- no.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, they're excited, you know, they don't really --
R:  O- o- oh!  [NOISE]

R:  Stuff going?  [LAUGH]
L:  R- right.  [SIGH]  "Where's my diary?"  [LAUGH]

R:  Uh-uh.  [NOISE]  I ain't --
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But, um ...
R:  -- heard of it ... before.  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  So, yeah, in a -- [SIGH] in terms of inventing a holiday, [SIGH] u- um, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I -- I really don't know what I would, ah, invent.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Probably --
R:  I --
L:  -- d- do -- something to do with elaborating Mothers' Day, maybe.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Make it a whole weekend.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  O- o- oh!
L:  And make it mandatory that the, you know, husband has to take the kids and, like, ah, give you peace and quiet.
R:  Y- yeah.

R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  So, there you go.  So, when you get together for all the family parties you can, like, figure o- out [LAUGH] --
R:  Figure out [LAUGH] --
L:  -- what -- who -- who in the family is, ah, you know, has some personality traits they [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, that's my feeling.  That's why I'm probably doing psychology.
L:  [LAUGH]  I reckon.
R:  Trying to figure everybody out.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh!
L:  Analyze everybody over, ah, ... turkey.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, what was I going to say about a holiday?  [SIGH]  I'd probably do a holiday that involves everybody.
L:  [MN]  Right.
R:  Like -- [NOISE] I don't know.  Where you have to separate one -- it -- it separates and involves everybody at the same time [NOISE] or something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, so, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  [NOISE]  I like Valentine's Day.  I might do nothing -- something like that.

L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah, I don't know.
R:  Well --
L:  Like I said, S- St Patrick's Day used to be a l- lot of fun but that was back when I was younger.  And we'd go out to the bars and, [SIGH] you know, into the city.  And --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- there's nothing like the St Patrick's Day parade in New York City.  It's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it's a lot of fun.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But ...
R:  I bet there'd be a lot of people.  [NOISE]

L:  -- would you say Easter's like the biggest holiday for your family or just for you, like ... that you prefer --
R:  O- o- oh!
L:  -- it or ...?
R:  Um, I think the whole family.  [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, 'cause it -- Easter's the one we all really just get together.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH]  Christmas most, you know, just the family in the house, immediate family ... sometimes.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, I'd say -- I'd say, Easter.  [NOISE]  Yeah, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- for everybody, really.  [SIGH]  Oh, or it could be just for me, you never know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  You never know
L:  Yeah, no, I -- I [SIGH] enjoy Easter --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- although, you know, I -- I really -- like the -- when my daughter was real little --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I got her a dress and we --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, we went to church and everything but [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the last couple of years --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there's always just so much going on [NOISE] that I -- I -- and I figure when is she ever [NOISE] going --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to wear this dress again [LAUGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  --y- you know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  So, I just never really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know --
R:  Uh-hum.  [NOISE]
L:  And such a --
R:  But I enjoy the Easter baskets too.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And same thing with Christmas too, like, I used to, um, [SIGH] get h- her a Christmas dress [SIGH] and then I think y- you know, for practicality, I mean [NOISE] when is she really ever going to wear it again [SIGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- y- you know.  So, ...
R:  Like a waste of money.
L:  Right so --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- it's the kind of d- dress -- you know, making them ... neat -- and, you know, 'cause we usually go to my mom's for Christmas dinner [SIGH] but just the immediate family.  You know, have them --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- dress neat and presentable but nothing over --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- board, you know?
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But it is cute to see them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all dressed up in [SIGH] the little Easter bonnets and everything.
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  That's cute.
R:  [SIGH]  Oh!  [SIGH]
L:  So, ... yeah, I don't know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- other than that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Thanksgiving's fun too, I like Thanksgiving.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Thanksgiving, just eat --
L:  Y- yes.  [SIGH]
R:  -- and eat.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes, and everyone's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- h- home it seems like, ah, [SIGH] you know, that's when you --
R:  Everybody comes through.
L:  Yeah, from college and --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, that's when you run into old friends and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- home visiting, you know, and [SIGH] -- and, ah, [LIPSMACK]
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, 'cause everybody -- my friends -- one of my friends from school came home with me for Thanksgiving 'cause she live all the way in Maine.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, wow!
R:  Can't get that many days.  You know, Virginia to Maine that's a long -- [SIGH] long ride so [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, I said -- "Well you just come home with me".  So, she came.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, that was nice.
R:  That was great.  Yeah.  That was good.
L:  I'm sure she enjoyed that.
R:  Y- yeah.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]  But then again she feel like, you know, she didn't want to intrude into my family.  That's like a family day.
