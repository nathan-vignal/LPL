L:  Hello, my name is Cammy.
R:  Hi, I'm Carmel.  [SIGH]  A- ah, nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
L:  Nice to meet you.  That's funny that your name is Carmel and I'm Cammy.
R:  Yes, [LAUGH] I know, that is pretty --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- funny.  [SIGH]  Ah --
L:  Are you in LA?
R:  Ah, no, actually I'm in, ah, Wisconsin.
L:  [NOISE]  Oh, okay.  I'm from Minnesota.
R:  Oh!  [SIGH]  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Very good.
R:  So, ...
L:  So, are we supposed to talk about Iraq now?
R:  I guess so.  [SIGH]  A- um.
L:  I'm confused.
R:  [SIGH]  Pardon?  [NOISE]
L:  I'm confused.  I've never done this.
R:  Oh, [SIGH] I think we just talk for a while about ... the topic and then they -- they stop us after our time is up.  [SIGH]
L:  Cool!
R:  So, [SIGH] yeah, so [NOISE] I kind of feel like the topic is maybe a little bit, ah, dated.  [LAUGH]  Since I --
L:  Yes.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, it seems like, um, [SIGH] we've ... gone way past, ah, inspection of arms in Iraq I guess.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yes.  I think they're still looking though and that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they should probably find something to justify what we're --
R:  [NOISE]  Ye- --
L:  -- we did.
R:  -- yeah.  I'm not sure they're going to find anything.  Ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- which makes the whole thing [MN] [SIGH] kind of awful but [SIGH] I don't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have very mixed feelings about the whole thing because I wasn't really a big supporter of the war and [SIGH] --
L:  Me neither.
R:  -- I'm really not a supporter of, ah, [SIGH] a war that seems to have, um, [LIPSMACK] just not been justified on completely false terms.  [SIGH]  I don't know, I mean, I know -- I don't know.  It just seems, like, [SIGH] [NOISE] it's good that Saddam is out but, ah, you know, I'm not sure that [NOISE] they gave very good reasons for why they were doing it.
L:  Right.  [SIGH]  I think the US is so ... into trying to fix things quickly.  [SIGH]  And trying to ... fix things all over the place that they can't really --
R:  [SIGH]  [MN]
L:  -- focus on one thing.  You know, it's Osama and then it's Saddam.  Now it's ... Korea.  It's -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah, [MN] yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  An- and I'm against -- I was against the war.
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]
L:  I was like, "There's no need".
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  But in a way there -- there is --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just to -- to stop terrorism but, yet, it's --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- during the war we were on high alert --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- after the war we've been on high alert.
R:  [SIGH]  I -- I mean I don't -- [SIGH] I've never bought the terrorism connection with Iraq.  [SIGH]  I mean [SIGH] I -- the terrorism it seems to me comes mostly from these --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [SIGH] rather militant religious groups but [SIGH] Iraq isn't really a breeding ground for militant religious groups so much as just [SIGH] -- I mean [NOISE] Saddam's kind of a wacko but [SIGH] -- or was kind of a wacko.  I guess he's dead now.  But I don't think that he was [SIGH] b- b- breeding terrorists, [SIGH] necessarily.
L:  No.
R:  I think that -- like mor- -- more like Saudi Arabia and places that we would never think of [SIGH] attacking are having more [SIGH] [NOISE] -- more terrorist activity.  I -- I -- I never bought the terrorist connection, I guess.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean [SIGH] the -- the weapons of mass destruction connection [LIPSMACK] -- I mean that really seemed to be what they were emphasizing and, of course, they haven't found any weapons and, [SIGH] you know, they certainly have ... plenty of time and people over there to look.  So, it just seems very, [MN] you know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] very sketchy.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.  I wonder how long they'll be ... looking?  [NOISE]
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, because people are still getting killed on a daily basis.
R:  That's true, Iraqis mostly but, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I guess --
L:  They're crushed.
R:  -- they have, ah, those -- whatever guerilla [SIGH] -- I don't know -- guerilla soldiers or something.  [SIGH]  It just seems like ... a bad situation, a bad place to be --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for US troops.  [SIGH]
L:  Agreed.  [SIGH]
R:  But I don't -- [NOISE] yeah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Hard topic.  [NOISE]  I think everyone was much more willing to [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- take a side when things were happening.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And now it's just like we've done it, it's --
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's like --
L:  -- kind of shameful.
R:  -- [LAUGH] yeah, it's like what's the point in saying, [NOISE] "I didn't support it" [NOISE] because I mean it happened whether I +supported it or not.  So, ...
L:  Right.
R:  [SIGH]  But --
L:  Yeah, I guess in a -- we're both on the same length that we didn't support it but w- we didn't do anything to stop it.  We didn't --
R:  Y- yeah.
L:  -- you know ...
R:  I mean, w- -- you know, what were you going to do to stop it.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know I mean, I guess there's the whole issue of, [SIGH] ah, various people calling for various, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, actions against the President for, sort of, misleading [SIGH] the ... public about the weapons of mass destruction.  [SIGH]  I guess I don't know.  I don't know if that makes a big difference to anyone that wasn't [NOISE] -- that was in support of the war, [SIGH] you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Like, my -- sort of my impression is that there's [SIGH] -- people that weren't in support of the war and probably [NOISE] w- wouldn't have been much swayed, even if they had found, [SIGH] you know, a couple of weapons of mass destruction.  I mean obviously if they found, like, [SIGH] a bunch of nuclear bombs [NOISE] that might have been a different thing but [SIGH] clearly they --
L:  Right.
R:  -- didn't find that.  [SIGH]  Whereas there were the people that I think just sort of supported it no matter what just to wipe out terrorism or whatever, [SIGH] and I don't think that necessarily those people really cared about w- whether or not we actually found weapons.  [SIGH]
L:  True.
R:  I don't know.  I don't know if that's true or not, really, because I guess I don't -- I don't know very many people that supported the war --
L:  No.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] personally.
L:  I mean there's so much we never know and will never know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just -- I don't know.  I mean our media portrayed at one point that they put the bombs on a boat and shipped 'em out to sea before we came over to look for the weapons, you know.  So, maybe they do exist and we just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, they're smart people --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] they can figure out how to keep them from us and then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we just go attack them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] and don't find anything.  So, maybe we should learn that that's not the correct way and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and actually I hope we don't find anything.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah.  I mean [NOISE] [SIGH] --
L:  Right.  And why are we allowed to have the same -- we have that big ... MOAB bomb that we tested that was --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [SIGH] a billion dollars --
R:  I know.
L:  -- which is a weapon of mass destruction, --
R:  Yeah. I -- I --
L:  -- t- two weeks before the war.  Like, why -- why can we have it and they can't and why [SIGH] --
R:  I -- I mean --
L:  -- I don't know.
R:  -- you know, I've always -- with keeping proliferation, or whatever, of arms t- to a minimum.  But, [SIGH] you know, it's just a -- when half of our allies thought that this was a bad idea [SIGH] and half of the American public thought this was a bad idea --
L:  Bad idea.
R:  -- [SIGH] that should have said something to someone.  But, [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, I'm not convinced that our President cares all that much about [SIGH] anyone -- but -- anything but his own aims.  So, -- but ...  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  And, of course, it's personal.  Everyone's decisions are personal --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in some way, and I think --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- Mr Bush had his personal decision he had to make.  And --
R:  Yeah.  [MN]  I don't know.  [SIGH]
L: -- I don't know how he got everyone --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- on board.  Like I -- I --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- would think that our government has more of a ... I don't know --
R:  Well, I mean I guess he had [SIGH] partisanship in his favor and -- and [NOISE] [SIGH] whatever.  The Democrats acting stupid and being, "Oh, we support the war.  We support everything".  [NOISE]  For- fortunately it sounds like there are people now that are, [SIGH] you know, s- saying, "Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Why did we support this? --"
L:  Right.
R:  "-- This is stupid.  This is bad.  You lied to us".  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  So, I think that's good.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah, what's crazy is s- so much could have happened.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  So, much crap.  Like, it could have been so bad and it wasn't.
R:  [NOISE]  Yeah.
L:  So, at this point [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I'm like, "Whatever [LAUGH] --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- j- just don't do it again".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Which is bad because everybody's lives were lost and how the --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- w- we're not in the greatest financial situation, --
R:  No.  And --
L:  -- as far as the country, because of it.
R:  -- [SIGH] it sure didn't seem to a- affect the financial situation at all [SIGH] in any kind of improving way.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]  I think -- I w- was never a fan of the war and, [SIGH] I don't know, I mean, what are we going to do to build up -- build Iraq back to a ... nation?  I mean it just seems like [SIGH] we, sort of, -- like we went to Afghanistan and we chilled out for a while and killed some people and then left.  [SIGH]  And that's like just crazy [NOISE] anarchy now, [NOISE] at least as far as I know.  [MN]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I just feel like the same thing's going to happen in Iraq.  [NOISE]  It's like we're going to b- -- chill out for a little while and get some good oil contracts and then leave.  [SIGH]  And leave, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sort of, the people to be s- stuck [SIGH] with the --
L:  Yo.
R:  -- situation possibly worse than they were in.
L:  Right.  Oh, [SIGH] yeah, we're seeing the NPR and people actually go in and they'll interview and these people [SIGH] don't have the money to buy milk because now there's so much money being, [SIGH] um, [LIPSMACK] counterfeited --
R:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  -- that they won't take their money any more.  Like we've -- we've screwed them over and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they've also lost trust of the allies.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  So, I don't know.  I wonder about France.  I want to know their whole -- their whole deal.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, I mean [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] [SIGH] ... I -- I -- I guess I'm not -- I don't think that -- there -- there's always, you know, political interests in whatever you do.  I mean, you don't just [SIGH] go against one of your major allies [NOISE] without both moral and political ... interests [NOISE] you know, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [MN] so I'm sure that they had some kind of business ties to Iraq that were a big deal but, [SIGH] at the same time, I really don't like this whole, [SIGH] "Oh, we're going to punish France now because they didn't support us wholeheartedly in the war" [SIGH] crap.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean I don't -- I don't think that there's any evidence that France did anything that was punishment worthy [SIGH] and it, sort of, angers me that they're like, "Oh, well we should punish you because you didn't completely agree with us" and it's just [NOISE] -- it's like an absurd way to be, you know?  [SIGH]  It's absurd to say, "I'm going to punish you because you didn't agree with me on this, [SIGH] ah, questionable moral standpoint.  [SIGH]
L:  Right.  But I -- I think we lost trust.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I think we think that they have ulterior motives.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They, you know -- of course, there's no way to prove it.  And I would hate for anything to happen --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and [NOISE] just like we tried to p- prove that Iraq has ... weapons of mass destruction, which we failed to do, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  So, I don't know.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Yeah.  I don't know.  [SIGH]  I mean, [SIGH] [MN] you know, ul- ulterior motives are not -- t- there wasn't any real good reason for them to support the war.  I mean I --
