R:  Clarissa Parker.  [NOISE]
L:  Jackie.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hello?  [NOISE]
R:  Hello?
L:  [SIGH]  Hi, have you done this before?  [SIGH]
R:  N- no, I haven't.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I've done this one o- other time and ten minutes is a lot longer than I ever expected.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  [LIPSMACK]  I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we're supposed to talk about holidays?  [SIGH]
R:  I guess, so.  Um, [SIGH] [NOISE] about your favorite holiday --
L:  [NOISE]  I guess your favorite --
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  -- h- holiday.  [NOISE]  I don't really --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have a favorite holiday.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  I don't either.  Um ...  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  A- ah --
R:  I guess --
L:  Go ahead.
R:  -- Christmas.  I -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, I would say [SIGH] Christmas because, you know, as a child --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I loved getting presents.  But now that I have my own children --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I like to see them get so excited about it.  [SIGH]
R:  Right.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  You like to give to them.
L:  [NOISE]  You have a baby too?
R:  [NOISE]  [MN]  Now!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How old's your child?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  She's two and I have a four year old.
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I have, um, ah, a little girl who just turned three and I have a six month old.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah. [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, we're now starting to get, sort of, fun things for Christmas, you know.  [LIPSMACK]  Before [SIGH] -- well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my -- my youngest was born on December fifteenth so, yeah, this Christmas was ... really [LIPSMACK] a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a dud for her.  [SIGH]
R:  My oldest is the [NOISE] twenty third of December.
L:  Oh, yeah, so they get ... so gypped on Christmas.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I hate that for them.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, I do but I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  --I like to [SIGH] explain to him that, ah, you know -- "You get to share it with somebody special".
L:  Well, yeah, that's true.  [NOISE]
R:  So, --
L:  That's a good way to look at it.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  And I try to teach him --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  --that it's not all about Chris- [NOISE] -- it's not all about presents.  [NOISE]  But --
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  -- it's kind of hard when you want to spoil 'em so bad and get 'em so many p- presents.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  I know.
R:  I think we kind of push that on 'em ourselves.  [NOISE]
L:  [NOISE]  I know I think so too.  Our kids are so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] well -- ah, and I know I-- ah, -- my two -- my th- -- well now she's three, [SIGH] you know, she wants something every time we go somewhere and I know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that I've made her that way.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, [SIGH] definitely --
L:  And now I'm, --
R:  -- we do the same thing.
L:  -- like, trying to turn that back and it's really hard.   [LAUGH]
R:  It is.  [SIGH]  We -- we do the same thing.  [SIGH]  I mean --
L:  I'm like, "Oh, she doesn't need something --".
R:  -- it's hard.
L:  "-- every time we go to Walmart".  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  I think that too.
L:  And the trouble is I know that, yeah, I just want to buy her everything.  [NOISE]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  But then I just end up having to pick it up every day.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  And then when you tell 'em, no, [LAUGH] --
L:  I know.  [NOISE]
R:  -- you don't have the money, that's fine -- they just -- don't understand that, [SIGH] --
L:  No, not at all.  [SIGH]
R:  -- because they expect it.  [SIGH]
L:  I know.  Do you [NOISE] -- what state do you live in?  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  Texas.
L:  Texas.  I live in North Carolina.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Uh-huh.  [MN]  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  So, [SIGH] I think also on, like, Christmas [SIGH] we've always, um, [NOISE] we've lived away from our parents [SIGH] and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, we always go home for the holidays and everything, and then last year being pregnant, you know, and having a baby, I couldn't go home.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  It w- was kind of nice to start our own kind of [SIGH] traditions and not go [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, definitely.
L:  -- and travel.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Usually we go and, you know, we see both sets of parents, four sets of grandparents and [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- you know, [SIGH] by the end of it I'm so exhausted and just ... I hate it.
R:  I know.  And then bringing all of it home and --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- cleaning up it's just --
L:  Yeah. t- the v- vans always so full my husband swears we're never doing it again but we keep doing it again.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I've already told my parents, um, [SIGH] that we're not coming home this Christmas.  They can come [LAUGH] see us.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause it worked so well last year.  [SIGH]
R:  Well, that'll work.  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Y- yeah.  [SIGH] Yeah, I mean it's just, ah, my brother [SIGH] -- I have one brother who's not married.  So, it's not hard for them to really travel.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, --.
L:  So, it's a lot easier.
R:  especially with kids.  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  It's difficult and they get cranky and we get cranky --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and [NOISE] --
L:  Oh, I know and just out of their routine [NOISE] and [SIGH] --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- it's just hard.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  It's hard for everyone involved.  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But I don't know it's weird that, I guess, 'cause Fathers' Day that's why they want you to talk about holidays maybe.  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.  Ah, [SIGH] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Fathers' Day's fun.  [NOISE]  We don't really [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
R:  -- we don't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do a lot for those holidays.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I let the kids get their dad something s- special that they've picked out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It, kind of, makes them feel good about it.  [SIGH]
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  Even it if's j- just some little thing.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just makes them feel proud that they picked it out and that their --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- dad just absolutely loves it.  [SIGH]
L:  Yes.  [SIGH]  Yeah, usually I find like a really cute picture -- or this year there's a picture of us, or them, [SIGH] and I just, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] frame it, you know, [SIGH] or put it on a card.  I do rubber stamping.  I made them a little card and everything.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  So, yeah, we don't really do a whole lot for [SIGH] Fathers' Day, or Father's Day.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Actually we don't do a lot for any [LAUGH] holiday.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, we -- we don't either.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We just kind of [SIGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- Christmas is probably the biggest one.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  My mother does a lot more for -- [SIGH] for them, it seems like, than I do.
R:  Oh, I know grandparents usually are.
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  At Easter time, you know, their Easter baskets were just filled --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- and filled and filled with --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- all this junk.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, junk that gets [LAUGH] --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- +chucked in the trash [LAUGH] thirty seconds later.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know it.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
L:  You hate -- you know, and then --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] she'll buy all these fruit snacks and candy and put a few of everything in the basket.  [SIGH]  I mean --
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  -- like three weeks later she mails me all the leftovers.  She says, "Well, here's all the left overs and stuff from the baskets".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there's another whole box of stuff.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  But [SIGH] I know she has good intentions.
R:  My kid's don't really eat sweets --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know why we buy it.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We -- we buy all the candy for the baskets too.  [SIGH]
L:  I know it.  [NOISE]
R:  And they don't eat it.  [SIGH]  So, guess who ends up ... getting all the junk?  [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, I know.  [SIGH]
R:  -- so it's not wasted.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Oh, I know.  That's why I'm thinking -- and, "How come I can't lose that extra fifteen [NOISE] pounds?"
R:  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
L:  Because I'm eating the junk off their [NOISE] plate all the time.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't know, we don't really -- and if -- I guess they said if we had to [SIGH] [NOISE] think of another holiday.  But, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I would just like a day [LAUGH] o- o- off.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you stay home with your children?  [SIGH]
R:  No, I -- I work.
L:  Do you?  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I'm a bookkeeper.  [SIGH]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  I am -- I've taught the last [SIGH] -- I guess --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- eight years but [SIGH] I was down to par- -- teaching just part time the last two years.  [SIGH]
R:  Uh-hum.
L:  And then last year it was -- a- ah, for this next, -- um, school, it's going full time so I'm taking next year off.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And it t- truly is a lot harder to stay home, [SIGH] I think.  [SIGH]
R:  I think so too, 'cause I did for a while with my, u- um, --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- older son and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it -- it took a lot, I mean, to e- entertain him all day and ...
L:  [SIGH]  [NOISE]  Well, and you have, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I mean, my husband has a little bit higher --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- expectations, I think, of me.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]  And I have a l- lot higher expectations of me.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  You know, I think the house should be clean now.  [SIGH]  The laundry --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- should be done and it's not.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.  [NOISE]  When you're home --
L:  [SIGH]  It's nothing more gets done than --
R:  -- and you feel like [SIGH] it -- they don't, --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, it -- it -- it's hard to understand that there's a lot --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of other things to do when you've got children you're constantly attending to them.  You're constantly, --
L:  [NOISE]  Right.  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] you know, ah, you just don't have time.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Right.  And my, um, [SIGH] six month old, --
R:  And you can never finish laundry.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, my goodness I can't believe two kids [NOISE] are just putting me over the edge.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I can hardly stand it.
R:  Oh, I know.  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
L:  So, I think instead of a holiday I would just like, once a month, to have, like, a whole day that [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't really want [SIGH] ... to go anywhere, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I want my kids to go somewhere.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And I want to be -- be in my house all by myself.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because I could really clean it fast --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if I was home alone.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that would -- that would m- make me very happy, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- if my house was really clean.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I would love that.
R:  Yeah, definitely.  [SIGH]  [NOISE]
L:  But it never is.
R:  If I just had a maid to do it for me I'd be h- happy.  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Well, yeah, that's true but I doubt if my husband would go for that now but ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Well, I told him if I went back to work full time I definitely was going to hire somebody to come in [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- at least once, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, every two weeks or something --
R:  Oh, yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know.  [SIGH]  I can -- I was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just surprised at how a -- a second child really just [SIGH] --
R:  [SIGH]  It's ama- --
L:  -- was a lot harder than just one.  [SIGH]
R:  -- yeah, it's amazing what ... one more child does.
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I know it.  [SIGH]  How did you hear about this research project?  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Um, off of [NOISE] volition dot com.  [NOISE]
L:  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]  Oh, my mom heard about it on a -- ah -- some Internet site and told me about it.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  That's -- ah, well they were discussing it on a forum and I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I ju- -- I thought I would try it out just to see.  [SIGH]
L:  Y- yeah.  [SIGH]  Yeah, I had to talk about, um, [SIGH] -- had to talk with -- I've done one other one and the lady was [SIGH] -- I think a lot older than me and it was about healthy l- lifestyles.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It was really hard to talk.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And that's about a healthy life style while you're eating all them ends.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, so [SIGH] it -- that one was -- that one went really slow.  [SIGH]
R:  Y- yeah, healthy life styles are just -- i- it's difficult when you have kids --
L:  Oh, I know it.
R:  -- when all they want is the junk food.  And, [SIGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] of course, you try to buy --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the healthy things that, you know, you want -- you want to feed them healthy foods.
L:  Uh-hum.
R:  [SIGH]  But, you know, they eat what they want [LAUGH] you know.
L:  Well, there's no time to really prepare something.
R:  No.
L:  It -- it's always you're making something quick.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  So, ...
R:  And cheap, you know, --
L:  Yeah.  [SIGH]
R:  -- you want -- you want to do something quick and cheap when you're -- especially when you've got two little ones.  [SIGH]
L:  I know it.  I really thought, you know, "O- o- oh, I'll cook --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- nice dinners" but that h- has not happened yet.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-hum.  [SIGH]
L:  I've only been out of school three weeks and I keep --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- saying, "It'll get better.  It'll get better".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  No, I don't think it does.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  I know.  I'm like, "Oh, my gosh.  I think this is r- really how it is" but I'm not telling my husband yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We're still having hot dogs for dinner.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  Right, if that's what the kids eat then ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I know it.  [SIGH]  But --
R:  I've got one that'll eat --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- [SIGH] ... a- any time, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I've got one that you got to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- p- practically --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- fight her just to eat.  [SIGH]
L:  [NOISE]  Now, my three year old used to be that way.  She's still picky but at least I can get her to eat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] pretty much some kind of meat --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] and vegetable and dairy product [SIGH] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- every meal.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  [SIGH]
L:  But for a while she'd eat, --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, a whole cucumber for dinner.  [SIGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, and that's it.  M- mine likes to drink milk.  [SIGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then if -- if you give her milk, [NOISE] and she's done.  And then that's it.  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH]  Really?
R:  She's full.  She doesn't want anything else.  [SIGH]
L:  Mine really like milk but [NOISE] now she's on c- chocolate milk.  That's all she'll drink.
R:  [NOISE]  Y- yeah, she'll -- she loves her -- she's gotta have chocolate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- milk in the morning.  It's kind of like her coffee.  [SIGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH]  I know I've been, like, now, I'm taking skim milk, you know, and I'm cutting it in half.
R:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.
L:  Because it's so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- thick, and --
R:  [NOISE]  It is.  [SIGH]
L:  -- so [SIGH] she does not need all of that.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]  All that sugar.  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
L:  I know it.  It seems like way too much.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  But --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [SIGH] I don't know -- no, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are people in Texas out of school yet?  [SIGH]
R:  [SIGH]  They are, yeah.  [SIGH]
L:  Are they?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I know, um, --
R:  My --
L:  -- some schools I know, you know, start after Labor Day and they go --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- to almost July first.  [SIGH]
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  But --
R:  [SIGH]  Of course we don't h- have the bad weather that a lot of 'em have so we get to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- g- get out p- pretty early [NOISE] [SIGH] ... h- here.
L:  [NOISE]  Uh-huh.  [SIGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, we, um, [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] -- it was -- I was --
