R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  I'm Robert.
R:  Hi, Robert.  I'm Kelly.  What do you watch [LAUGH], if anything?
L:  I actually don't.
R:  You don't what?
L:  Well, that's exactly it.  I don't watch anything.
R:  Don't watch anything.  Okay.  Why don't you watch?
L:  The news I suppose that could pass as reality T.V.
R:  That's true.  That's the best reality T.V.  However ...
L:  How about yourself?
R:  Um, I have previously watched, um, The Bachelor.  However, I don't think I'd watch it again, um, and like I watched maybe The Osbornes once just to see what it was and I'm trying to think of the other one that I watched recently.  It's whipping outta my head.  I think the reason people prob- -- oh, Joe Millionaire --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I watched part of that.  Um, why do you think people watch it?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I can tell you one of the reasons that the networks push it and, you know, it's partly that it's pushed as it's fairly cheap for them to make.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Now, as for -- and it doesn't require that much creativity either.  [LAUGH]  The participants provide the creativity to some extent --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and people identify with the -- the people on the shows.
R:  Right.  Kinda like soap operas I think [LAUGH] probably, um ...
L:  Well, yeah, and -- and strangely enough more believable [LAUGH], you know, the shows themselves are unbelievable.
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Um, I think that ...
L:  They could be your neighbor.
R:  It could be your neighbor.  I think that, um, a lot of it though -- like, some of it's like deceiving because I think that when people are put in those situations that they may not actually act like they normally would.  You know what I'm going?
L:  No, I would doubt it.
R:  So, is it really reality?  I don't know.  And a lotta the ...
L:  Well, I watched long, long ago -- sorry to interrupt, um, I was talking with my cousin --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and this was when this was all beginning and they took a -- a bunch of young, uh -- I guess university students and put them in an apartment in New York and paid for everything and, uh, we sorta were joking around saying, "Oh, yes, that's really reality.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I get to live in New York.  Someone else pays for it".
R:  Exactly.  Hey, I'll do it, right?  [LAUGH]  When was this?  Many, many, many, many years ago or ...?
L:  I would like this would be five years ago maybe --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I can't even tell you what the show was called.
R:  Right.  I see.  So, you don't watch anything, huh, just the news?
L:  Just the news, the news hour occasionally.
R:  I think though like the -- the premise for a lotta shows are also deceiving.  Um, I don't know.  Like, some of the participants don't even know wh- what's really going on until the -- until the end.  So, in that, uh, fact they're -- they're really not in it -- I mean, they don't really know what's going on either.  So, is it really real?  It's -- you know?  I don't know.  It's strange.
L:  Well, it plays also the distinction that people have introduced, uh, it's between reality and virtual reality, uh, and the idea that the Internet and so forth in some sense is not real, which itself is a pretty, uh, fictitious distinction I think.
R:  Mhm.  [MN]  [LIPSMACK]  Now, what else did they want us to talk about?  [LAUGH]  Um ...
L:  Um, bets me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.  What else about reality T.V.?  If there was a reality T.V. what would you -- I mean, if there was a show what type of show would you -- would you consider watching?  I mean, did you watch the war?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, yes, but I watched the war mainly via French and British radio and, uh, British newspapers, uh, actually partly because of the desire to have some reality in my [LAUGH] -- in my T.V.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:   Um, the -- I don't know if you followed closely the story with the, uh -- Private Lynch.  But there's the need for a television, uh, Hollywood Pentagon version and then there's what really happened.  [LAUGH]
R:  They're gonna make a movie into that?
L:  Well, I mean, what we saw on the television wasn't what happened.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  A British documentary, uh -- basically a number of Brits have -- went to the place and chatted with people and done a documentary and, uh, it was made for a T.V. movie.  Uh, there was this private.  She, uh, did -- did fall into enemy hands, but the truth of the story pretty well much ends there.
R:  Really?  That's interesting.  I hadn't heard that.
L:  If you have some time, uh, go to the D.B.C. site and, uh, search, uh, the name Private Lynch and you'll find some extraordinary things.
R:  Wow!  Are you from Britain?
L:  No, I'm Canadian actually.
R:  Oh, are you?  Okay.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Interesting.  But you like to follow the British news do you?
L:  I'm much into news and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I found a couple of things and found that you can get no truth from any one source and you can't even get any truth from, uh, a number of sources in one country.  So, I very much like to play, uh, British and French news off against each other and if I really wanna get into something I like to even having news from other countries.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's simply that, uh, the B.B.C. is an exceptional broadcaster on most subjects and the French are just so incredibly, uh, cynical that, uh, they give you another slant on, uh, the truth.
R:  I see.  So, actually I guess everybody's viewpoint is different, and going back to reality T.V. [LAUGH] I'm sure [NOISE] --
L:  Your child?
R:  -- um, is that, uh -- where was -- where was I going with that?  That, uh ...
L:  Everyone's views different.
R:  The views are different from where you see it.  So, in this reality T.V. shows I'm sure that the views of these people are always different too, you know, and I've never --
L:  Absolutely.
R:  -- I've never seen like these shows, Survivor or anything like that, I've never watched those.  Um, I don't -- I don't know what a lot of these are about, but I don't wanna sit there and watch, uh, Ozzy Osborne from week to week to see what he's doing.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's kinda boring to me and, um, the same thing ...  [LAUGH] Have you ever watched -- no, you probably haven't -- but some of its ab- absolutely sickening -- like the Anna Nicole Smith Show?  I just watched that.
L:  Oh, there is one?
R:  Anna Nicole Smith.  It was -- it's totally horrible.  I mean, it's just horrible that -- that she's on T.V. like weekly.  It's -- it's disgusting.
L:  Could you describe it as Gold Digger Inc. or what?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, it's just -- she looks like she's on drugs the whole time and she just -- you know, it's all about -- I mean, like there's sex stuff and there's, um -- what she does is just so weird.  It's just -- it's just really weird to see her like -- I don't know.  Its just -- it's gross to me.  It's just really awful and I don't know why they have it on T.V., but people must watch it.  I watched it just to see what is this all about and, I mean [MN], I've never watched it again and I couldn't believe that there are actually -- and they must be making money on it because it's still on.  So, it's just really weird what they put on now.
L:  Do you notice any, uh, distinction in -- or difference in the advertisers that are on during these shows versus, uh, you know, other T.V. shows?
R:  You know, I really don't really know about the advertisers.  Um, I -- I try to tune out [LAUGH] advertisers.
L:  Well, that's understandable.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I really do.  I -- I don't pay much attention even when I'm watching regular T.V.  Just I really tune out the advertisements, um, either I put the mute button on or, you know --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I go do something or -- it's -- it's just that it irritates me.  Some people, like my husband, he like recites the [LAUGH] -- the ads and I'm like, "How do you even know what they say?"  It's like, oh, I can't stand listening to it.  But, um, they're coming out with some really, uh, weird shows like marrying people you don't know and --
L:  Good God!
R:  -- you know, I mean, how these people put themselves in these situations is beyond me.  I really don't understand it.  But they must really need something in their lives, you know?  Whether it be ...
L:  Or -- or they're acting themselves.  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Or whether it be their -- this fifteen minutes of fame [LAUGH] so called thing, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They'll be famous for a little while and then nobody will remember them.
L:  Andy Warhol.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, I think he's a bit more famous than fifteen minutes but, uh ...
L:  Well, no, I think he was the person that came out with that expression.
R:  Oh, is he -- is he the one that said that?  Oh, okay.  You got me there, didn't ya?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, it's not serious.  [LAUGH]
R:  Very good.
L:  We're not all, uh, historians of Andy Warhol thankfully.
R:  [LAUGH] Interesting.  Well, what else about reality T.V.?  Good Lord!
L:  Well, one thing that I would -- when this all begun -- and I think that you could say it began seven years ago -- it may be even more -- I remember flipping through some, uh -- across some channels with a room of people, uh, who I really didn't know and, uh, one of the shows had, uh, you know, uh, accidents basically, uh -- not accidents where people were getting killed but, uh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- people were doing sorta paragliding on the edge of the hill, not parachuting, actually trying to just float above the hill where the wind hits it and, uh, the wind hit -- the way this guy twisted --
