L:  My name is Valerie Blackman.
R:  Hello, my name is Mazafa[?], um, I'm from south of Washington, um, actually, uh, I am not a U.S. citizen, I am, uh, half German, half Turkish.  So, I have first of all to apologize for my bad English.  And, um, where are you from?
L:  I am from Trinidad in the western east.  Hi, Mazafa.
R:  Hi.  Um, another -- and another thing is I did not watch the, uh, reality shows so much, um, but, um, I -- I -- I know more about T.V. programming back in my, uh, country in Germany or in Turkey and, um, but I followed the new one.  It was very popular to the -- a program to -- about marrying a millionaire.
L:  Right.  Well, the only reality based T.V. I -- I watch now is, um [LIPSMACK], the -- oh, what is the name of it? -- The Great Race.
R:  The Great Race?
L:  Oh, is it The Great Race they call it?  Or, um -- where at the end like they have -- I think it's -- they started off with fifteen participants --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then at the end, um, you know, it boils down to one person and whoever wins gets a million dollars.
R:  Uh-huh.  And what has that -- that person to -- what has he or she to do to win the money?
L:  Like they're in teams.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like it's I think, um, twelve -- I think they started with fifteen teams --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then, um, you know, like they eliminate -- they eliminate them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, like it might be you have to -- like, for example, you have to -- I understand --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that um, um, the participants -- like some of the participants had to go through, um, a ballroom --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- with, um, drinks --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's on a tray and the first person -- well, if you get through --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, then you go on to the next level and, you know, that sort of thing.
R:  I see.  So, um, you -- you understand the program co-, um, completely after watching it -- it several times and not so the first time, but you had to, um, learn it as something that's, uh, important to learn.
L:  Yeah.  Like it -- well, like they eliminate the people --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um, I'm trying to remember some of the other things that they had to do in the contest, um, like -- like in previous shows --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it -- oh, you know what it's called?  It's called The Great Race.
R:  The Great Race.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yes, and like they had to -- like I remember one of the shows they had to, um -- they had to ski down the mountain --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and then they had to cross this --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um [LIPSMACK], between two, um -- two hills I guess you would call it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and like they had to cross on -- on, um, you know, a very, very -- like a cable almost, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's high up in the mountains.
R:  I see.  So, this is like a competition, you know -- I think and, uh, us- usually they are, uh, either teams competing or the most popular ones are, uh, dating, uh, programs I think that, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they are more popular and, um, people, uh -- there's -- there's a competition too and, uh ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, and to ...
L:  I see the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the millionaire com-, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- competition and I -- like I don't know if -- you know, if that's the way to choose somebody, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] It's all about the money.  But, uh, I think finally they, uh -- it was obvious that, uh, the guy was not a millionaire actually.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and they say, um, that we watch is not always the reality, but -- but the people want to show us because they know that they are screened and ...
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there's one -- there's, um, another one that is, um -- it's -- I think the guy is a millionaire --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but -- and he gets to choose between these, uh -- I don't know how many girls there are --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, um -- but the thing -- the -- the catch is, like at the end the girl whoever the guy chooses --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, she will get a million dollars.
R:  She will get it?  [LAUGH]
L:  She will get a million dollars.
R:  Wow!
L:  But the -- but the thing is that she cannot tell him -- none of the girls who are in the competition --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- can tell him that, you know, they will get a million dollars at the end of the [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if he chooses them, you know?
R:  They don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  He doesn't know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I guess all of them will throw themselves at him.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that he can choose h-, um, that girl, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, it's so -- it's getting really, really ridiculous now, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I know.  And, uh -- and what -- everyone agrees that it's all about the money by choosing someone like the -- who the mon- -- who has the money, uh, chooses the girl and the girls they -- they come all for the money and there's nothing else that ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, and, um, nobody says that is, uh -- that is -- and I think of all or something like that, um -- all the very few people say is that, um -- so this is the way it is nowadays I think.
L:  Yeah, and I think it's -- you're losing like a lot in -- in -- when it's done like in that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Um, and it is also interesting that these are the most popular, um, reality shows, uh, but, uh, people watch too much, um, movies, fictional, uh, things.  So, um, they are now -- now more interested in reality, but if it is reality they still -- cinema has, uh, improved in years.  So, maybe the reality shows will improve in years too.  Maybe they will come up with something more real than the reality shows today and ...
L:  Well, I think like to get the people on the -- on the shows -- on these different shows --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, you know, they all -- they're all, um -- they have to be like, um -- they have to have some sort of lure to -- or some of sort attraction --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's where, you know, it loses it's -- it's appeal, you know, to -- to the audience.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's one of the ways because like, you know, if -- if you know that somebody's only doing something for money, which is the case for most of them, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like you're not gonna be interested because then it cheapens the show, you know?
R:  Yeah, that is right and -- and if it is marrying or, um, going out with someone for the money then it's much worse.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  Oh, well, but at least, you know, they -- they -- sometimes they come up with -- with interest- interesting themes like, you know -- like that, um [LIPSMACK] -- The Great Race --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which was on --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like it was on on Thursday.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like they have different, um, things that the con- -- the contestants have to do and like yesterday -- like, I missed most of the show yesterday, but I understand that one of the things was, um, bungy jumping --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and like I look at that and I'll go, "Oh, my gosh!"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Like the things that people will do for money.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  It's endless.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But there were two old, um -- what do they call them? -- air controllers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and like, you think like h- half of these things in The Great Race, like if it's a race that means you have to be running [LAUGH] part of the time --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and like the -- the two of them were two older men and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I guess they went into it for the adventure.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I don't think that -- they didn't look fit to me --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and like one of them [LAUGH] he -- he -- he wrecked his knee.
R:  Yeah.  Really?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Then there were two overweight -- like a husband and wife, um --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they were as overweight as ever and, um, like -- well, you -- you sort of -- like they were the first to be eliminated --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and you feel sort of happy but sad --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because like they said they went into the race, um, you know, to sort of bring themselves --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- closer or to get some adventure, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so that part of it was nice.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but then like there's some of the contestants like, you know, they wanna win.  So, like they -- like they -- like, okay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like the very first issue when it -- the very first, um, uh, time that it was shown, like they had to line up and, um -- to get a plane and like these people were jumping the line and, you know, like they were very, very uncouth, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it -- you see the -- it brings out the -- I guess the animal instinct --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and like, you know, you also see like the peoples' personalities coming out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like later on, you know?
R:  Yeah.  And why do we like to watch this?  I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it is something -- this is ...  [LAUGH]  I mean, um, okay, doing it is something else but, uh, watching it is -- I -- I don't know, um -- it -- it is exciting, it's fun but, uh, is that the reason we are watching it or does it, uh -- do we have to bring our animal instinct out of us too?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know what?  Like, I -- I have a very, very bad habits --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- even when like I'm looking --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I'm looking at let's say like a soccer game or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- whatever and as long as it's not like my favorite -- my team --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like that's playing --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I always go for the underdog.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, like, you know, it's like you look at one of these things and you always want the underdog to win in the team --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the game, right?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, or -- or --
