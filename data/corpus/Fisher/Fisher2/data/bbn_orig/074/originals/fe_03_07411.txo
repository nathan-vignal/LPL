R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi.
R:  Uh, my name is Lydia.
L:  Hi, Lydia.  My name is Aaron.
R:  Nice to meet you sort of.  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.  Uh [LAUGH], where you from, Lydia?
R:  Uh, Seattle.
L:  Oh, see, I'm from New York.
R:  Mhm.  Wow!
L:  Pleased to meet ya.  What have we gotta talk about?
R:  Um ...
L:  They said either gossip, alcohol, tobacco.
R:  Well, I -- my personal feeling is probably smoking is the worst of all those.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it really is.  It's a very nasty habit.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I smoke, you know?
R:  Oh --
L:  Yeah, and it's hard to quit.
R:  -- sorry.
L:  No, no, no, no.  Really it's hard to quit.  It's all right.
R:  I know.  I, um -- I am a --
L:  Because ...
R:  -- recovering addict and, um, they say that smoking cigarettes is like the hardest habit to kick.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, I ...
L:  It's very hard to quit --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I smoke like -- like maybe two or three packs not a day --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but -- you know, I can't afford it but, you know, two or three packs a week, you know, and I tried to like space 'em out because I really can't afford them now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Well, they keep adding, uh, taxes on to cigarettes here in Washington.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think they're up to like five dollars a pack now.
L:  Oh, in New York they're seven.
R:  A pack?
L:  Yep.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yep, seven dollars in New York.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yeah.  They're only cheaper out west like where you're at and down south like North Carolina, Virginia, they're cheap, but New York ...
R:  Well, they can sell 'em, uh, tax free on reservations --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ...
L:  A lotta people go online, you're right and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- order them on ...
R:  But then, um, you know, if you get caught doing that you get in trouble.
L:  Really?  I didn't know.  So, everybody in your family is a smoker?  How many smokers in your family?
R:  Mm, I -- no, my Mom used to smoke and my sister used to smoke and, uh, they had to quit for health reasons.
L:  Yeah.  So, how's the weather in Seattle right now?
R:  Overcast.
L:  It's -- it's what?
R:  Overcast.
L:  Oh, what's overcast, what do ya mean?
R:  Like, um, not quite raining, but the sky isn't -- the sky's gray.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause it -- it's -- it's cloudy here.  It was raining all week, but it ...
R:  Um, I don't remember.  Are we supposed to stick on the subject?
L:  Yeah.  Well, we can just talk and make up stuff in between time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Have you done this -- have you done this before?
L:  No, it's my first time, but I'm still trying to keep the conversation going.  We've got ten -- we've got ten minutes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know ...?  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  It wasn't --
L:  Yeah.  But I ...
R:  -- the most exciting, uh, subject that we were given.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Some of the examples they gave me were ...
L:  And even like when I'm in New York I go to like a lotta clubs and stuff --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I -- everybody smokes, but the people that don't smoke they don't like to be in the same room as smokers so that ...
R:  Well, see, I'm kind of, um -- I mean, I don't like being around smoke and if I'm -- say if I'm in a bus shelter and somebody lights up I, uh, often times I'll leave or, um, ask them to leave --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um -- but I do kind of feel like people should be allowed to smoke and, um, like they're trying to ban smoking completely in restaurants and -- and, um, I feel as long as they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- have a -- an area to do that that they should be allowed to --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I think ultimately it's going to, um, affect businesses, you know, that people like to smoke after a meal and, um --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think the same with -- with like night clubs I think that that would affect --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- business if they --
L:  Because what ...
R:  -- if they banned it, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because when I go out a lotta people will leave the club, you know, the nonsmokers will leave --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, whatever, if -- if they're not -- like if they banned it -- smoking inside now, you can't smoke, uh, in a lotta rest- -- public places.  It's smoke free now.  You get a ticket if you're caught.  But a lotta people still disregard that.  They still light up, you know?  So, the nonsmokers get very offended and leave, you know?  They leave ...
R:  My, uh -- my theory is that, you know, smoking is part of going out, you know?  People -- people that tend to go out and drink and party they tend to be smokers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, it's -- it's just a part of it and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't really expect people not to smoke.
L:  Yeah.  I try to be considerate first of all.  It's thunder storming now here.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I just saw the lightning and sometimes the cable goes out, you know, the -- the direct T.V. that I have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the cable goes out with the satellite thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Like now I had one cigarette tonight -- this evening.  I had a couple today 'cause I couldn't afford it.  So, I had like two cigarettes today and my craving is all right.  I'm satisfied.  As long as I get to bed -- get through the night, you know?  But I'll need a cigarette in the morning.
R:  Well, have you tried any -- anything to quit smoking?
L:  No.  No.  Uh-uh.  Nobody will have it.  But I've got -- but I need to 'cause, you know, I'm thinking about cancer and getting older and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it's a really scary feeling when you think about your health, you know?  You know?
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  It really is.  I -- I'm trying to ...
L:  And how long you been smoke free?  You've never smoked before?
R:  Um, I smoked at a young age.  I'm talking, you know, like when I was a -- a young teenager.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But I never inhaled because I didn't like it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I never got the habit.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And the few times that I did inhale I got really sick.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, mostly I just did it to be, you know, part of a crowd or, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just to be cool I guess.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I did the same thing.  I think everybody goes through that in their adolescent years, you know?
R:  So, I'm -- I'm glad I did.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I, uh -- I did other things that I won't discuss but, um --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- cigarettes was one habit I didn't have.
L:  Uh-huh.  And, um [LIPSMACK], uh, are you married or, what, single?
R:  Single.
L:  Single.  And if you were to get married would you marry a smoker or a nonsmoker?
R:  Um, well, the father of my child is a smoker and, uh, I -- I certainly wouldn't -- my son has asthma.  So, I couldn't have a smoker in the house.
L:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
R:  But --
L:  That kicks it up.
R:  -- they -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't eliminate somebody just because of that.
L:  Right.  Right.  Would you help them quit?
R:  Definitely.
L:  [LAUGH] Don't they have Smokers Anonymous?
R:  I'm sure they do.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know ...
R:  But I know it's hard just to use willpower that ...
L:  But I know people who have tried the patch.  I know people who have tried the gum.  After they stop successfully when they get stressed out they go back to the cigarettes.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's -- it's a habit.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is a habit.  You get -- you -- you -- you've trained yourself to, uh, have a cigarette --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- when you get stressed out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or, you know, after sex, after eating, whatever, you know?  It's -- it's a habit and -- and you do it for so long that it's just second nature and you do it without thinking about it.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  And it takes -- I don't think like the patch by itself is totally effective.  I think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that, you know, like some kind of, um, behavior modification is called for as well.
L:  Yeah.  The -- the patch puts nicotine in your body.
R:  Yeah.  But you taper down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- because -- I mean, part of the thing of smoking is the actual smoking, you know?  You're doing something with your hands.  You're doing something with your mouth.  People are orally fixated --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, so it's not just the drug itself, you know?  It's -- it's the whole -- the whole picture, you know?  It's the -- it's the ac- --
