L:  Yeah, my name is Travis Castell.  I'm referring to Seventh Heaven, the reality show Seventh Heaven because I like watching Seventh Heaven 'cause it's a family show, it has a family and three kids, two boys -- well, actually four kids, two boys and two girls.  The youngest one is one of the girls and they always -- 'cause I just like family.  Family is my favorite type of topic I like to do, uh, uh, my -- my goal is to have a family one day and I ...
R:  Hey.  Hi.
L:  Hey.
R:  I think we're supposed to have a conversation.
L:  [PAUSE] Okay.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't think they're just recording.
L:  What?
R:  I don't think they're just recording.  I think we're supposed to have a conversation --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- about reality T.V.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  I didn't know if it said the recording would start off with a beep.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sorry.
R:  You just introduce yourself.  Hi, I'm Kelly.
L:  I'm Travis.
R:  Hi, Travis.  So, I think it's on reality T.V. shows, like Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire and stuff like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  Do you ever watch any of those?
L:  I might watch something without know- knowing that they're reality shows.  If you name a few of 'em I can tell ya if I watch 'em.
R:  Uh, let's see, uh, American Idol.
L:  Oh, I watch that one.
R:  Yeah.  That's a reality show.  A reality show I think is when they have just a normal person who's not an actor --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I got what you were saying about Seventh Heaven.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  But I think that's all actors.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And this is like reality T.V. show where they take regular guys and gals --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- oh, like Joe Millionaire or things like that.
L:  Does Road -- does, uh Road Rules qualify for that?
R:  Yeah, I think it does.
L:  'Cause I watch that too and I watch, um, Real World too on M.T.V.
R:  Yeah, that's def- -- I think Real World was the first reality show.
L:  Yeah, I watch all those.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, that one's fun.
L:  Yeah, I know.  It's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's -- I think people watch it -- I think they're kinda trashy, but [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, they are.
R:  -- it's -- I -- it's kinda like junk food T.V.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I do kinda like it, um, it's kind of -- you can kind of escape what's going on in your own life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I get distracted watching these other people's lives.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And I w- -- also this new thing that just came out on M.T.V. not so long ago, Surfers' Girls.  I don't know -- they're ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I've watched a few minutes of that.
L:  Yeah, I've been watching that and they've been getting -- when they get to the water they get so mad at each other 'cause they wanna win, they wanna go ...
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seems that most of them they have people leave, like there's a model show and someone gets cut out, in American Idol people get cut out --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I wonder why people like to watch that so much.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's pretty interesting to see who's gonna stay -- who's gonna remain and what they do to try to stay on there.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  It's kind of you seeing people at their worst, you know?
L:  Yeah, I know.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Like Real World you see them when they're cranky and --
L:  Oh, yeah, I know.
R:  -- just outta bed and they just look awful.
L:  Oh, yeah, they do.
R:  That's funny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, God, what else?  What are the other reality shows out there?  Lots of match matching shows --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- like the Bachelor.
L:  Oh, what about -- there's, um, Change of Heart.
R:  Oh, I haven't seen that one.  What's that one about?
L:  You haven't seen -- you haven't seen Change of Heart?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, that's been out for years.  This one is about, um -- well, two -- two people think they need to have time off, the one that has been around for a while, they think they need to have time off and go out with someone else to see if they're made for someone -- they need -- made for each other or not.  They give someone else a try.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, they switch partners.  Like if I was dating someone I'd say, "Hey, I'm gonna go out with this girl here, you go out with that guy, and we'll see if we're really ..."
R:  They test drive someone else?
L:  Yeah.  Test drive someone else and then they'll -- they'll how it goes with them and then at the end -- end of the show they'll say, "Do I think I'm ready for a change of heart or not?"  If not that means they both wanna stay and they'll -- they'll work out their differences with each other.
R:  Oh, that's kinda cute.
L:  Yeah.  It gives them a test drive to see if they're really meant for each other or not.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  And there's another show that I watch too that's kinda interesting -- I like Fifth Wheel.  Have you seen that?
R:  Oh, that one's kinda funny.
L:  [LAUGH] I know.
R:  I watched it once.
L:  Yeah, and then -- and then Blind Date.
R:  Yeah, that one's really funny too.
L:  Yeah, I saw it last night too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  There's a lot of reality T.V.
L:  Yeah.  I watch a lotta those.  I didn't realize they were considered reality T.V., but I do now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I watch 'em all the time.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it doesn't seem anymore like reality than -- than any of the other shows out there I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  There's -- there's a few things that I used to watch a long time ago that they don't air no more today.  Like one time there was a show -- I don't remember the name of it -- three gir- -- if you're into the opposite sex -- but three girls on the other side of the net and one guy on the other side and he -- he will [several inaudible words] 'cause that's number two and he asks these questions, which one he thinks, but I'll pick -- test number three, so that's the one he wants to go out with, then the other two come around ...
R:  Oh, the Dating Game.
L:  I think that's what it's called.  But the other two come around, the one that he missed, the one that he didn't see, but then he actually just -- his final date he picked.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember that one.  That's an old one.
L:  Yeah, it is.  It's real old.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That was when I was like a teenager.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember that.
L:  And then there's another one too.  I don't know -- like the blind- -- behind the screen the shadow -- a shadow of the person.  You only get to see the shadow of their outline behind something --
R:  Oh, I never saw that one.
L:  -- and then they come out he -- he thinks which one he likes to -- yeah, he likes the best by looking at the shadow pics.  Then they come out and start talking and if they don't like him they -- then he puts the buzz on 'em, buzz, you're gone.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, interesting.  So, you just need to go by their answers, you have no idea what they look like?
L:  Yeah.  No idea.  Those ones.
R:  That's kinda cool.
L:  Yeah.  Some of these game shows keep their, um -- their, um, looks behind the screen and just let 'em talk to 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like people can actually get an idea of what they are inside.
R:  Yeah.  There was one -- goodness -- oh, Married by America.
L:  Oh.
R:  They -- they started out like that, where like the Mom and the friends picked out the best person --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for their daughter to get engaged to --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then she couldn't see him, they on the other side of a screen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, they're engaged before they even saw each other.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And there's new game -- there's this new one that just -- not -- it hasn't aired very much often.  But this person gets -- like actually gets pictures -- this, um, married person -- he's gonna marry out of fifty girls or a hundred, I'm not sure, he starts out with.  Then he narrows it down to one.  I don't remember the name of it.
R:  Oh, I think I know which one you're talking about.  Is it the Bachelor?
L:  Yeah, that's it, the Bachelor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I did see that one.  I kinda got hooked on that one for a little while.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I kinda did too.
R:  'Cause you get everybody's story and then you wanna check back and see what happens.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  That's kinda funny.
L:  Yeah, it's interesting how you see people on like -- especially on Blind Date --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- how people just for a short period of time, like last night, this guy just wanted to see what their sex drives were --
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  -- to see if they had a good sex drive for him.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] See, that's outta control.  A lotta these shows can get really --
L:  I know they can.
R:  -- a little too personal, you know?
L:  Yeah, they can.
R:  Like, take it a little too far.
L:  I think so too.  [LAUGH]  I've seen Blind Date sometimes -- a few times -- or not Blind Date -- what's it called?  Um, Lima Date a few times --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where the -- where the, um, person who's on they're trying to pick a date, like the guy has three girls, he -- I mean, don't you think you're actually getting a little personal too much with the question?
R:  Mm.
L:  And then there's another show I can't remember of it, what it's called --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh ...
R:  What's it about?
L:  It's a ship.  It's -- the title has got ship in it.  There's a ship in it.  The title of it has a ship in it.  [MN]
R:  Oh, I think I know what you're talking about, but I never saw it.  I think I remember an ad for it.
L:  But it has ship in -- on the title of it.  I can't remember.  Well, they get to go actually spend a whole day or two -- or almost a week with each other.
R:  Oh.
L:  This is day one, day two, day three, and they get to go out and do all kinds of stuff at a hotel sometimes, spend it in a hotel, go to the beach.  What do they do?  Some -- one time I watched it they went on a cruise and some went on the beach and spent the night.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's okay.
L:  But they got a whole week with each other.
R:  Like a vacation.
L:  Yeah, like -- it's like a mini vacation with each other.  They get to kinda see how each other does on vacation.
R:  Oh, that's interesting.
L:  They both have their own separate rooms kinda, but they ...
R:  Yeah.  Keep it clean for T.V.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  And stuff like that and ...
R:  So, why do you like to watch shows like that?
L:  Um, I just -- I think it's, um, a little interesting to find out how people are gonna pick each other.  How people go -- what people will do out there in America just to find the right date [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or their wife and so -- 'cause in -- plus I don't -- I'm not -- I don't have -- I'm always looking for girls 'cause I never can seem to find the right one too.  I just kinda seeing what those people like do out there to get to those gir-, uh -- their dates [LAUGH] --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- and stuff and it's just weird what other people can do.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It is.  It's fun to see that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's hard to picture myself in that situation.  I would never do it.
L:  You'd never go on one of those shows?
R:  I would never do it.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.
L:  I've always -- I've always thought I'd like go on Blind Date, the Blind Date one.
R:  Yeah.  That'd -- that'd be okay I guess.
L:  That -- that one seems to be okay.
R:  I think I'm a little too private about things like that, you know, that I wouldn't want just anybody.
L:  Oh, you don't -- you don't wanna air on ...?
R:  I'm nervous enough on a date.  I wouldn't want T.V. cameras there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  So am I.  [LAUGH]  But I think I could handle it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because the camera's not -- as long as a big crowd's not watching me -- in front of me --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I can handle it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think the Blind Date one is kind of something more interesting.  You're not up to a cha- -- a challenge or anything.  It's just one on one with you.
R:  Right.
L:  But if I had to do like on Lima Date, three people, I don't know about that one --
R:  That'd be tough.
L:  -- 'cause -- 'cause sometimes on Lima Date, like last night I saw, in front of this guy the other two girls make rude comments of the girl --
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  -- to try to -- to try to show the guy [inaudible].
R:  Oh, that's mean.
L:  "Is that all ya got?  Is that all ya got to talk to him about?  Oh, what kinda personality is that ya got there girl?"
R:  Oh, that's so mean.
L:  So, like you're trying to put the other girls down [LAUGH] and so that is why if I go -- I'd rather do Blind Date by myself 'cause I'm one on one, nobody around me to hesitate me to -- competition -- be in competition about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I like Blind Date the best.  I would do that one.
R:  Would you do something like Real World?
L:  Yeah, I would.  Yeah.  I would do that.
R:  Like move into an apartment with people you didn't know and ...?
L:  Real World?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, 'cause it's not -- it's really -- I --
