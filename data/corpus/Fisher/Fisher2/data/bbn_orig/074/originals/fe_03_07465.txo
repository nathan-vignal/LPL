L:  Meike.  [NOISE]
R:  Oh, hi.  I'm Jean.  H- how're you doing?
L:  I'm doing okay.  How are you doing?
R:  Great, great.  Where do you live?
L:  Um, I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
R:  Where?
L:  Tulsa, Oklahoma.
R:  Oh, wow, Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Ah, I'm out here in Los Angeles, California.
L:  Oh, really?  I just moved from Irvine, California not a few -- mm, a few days ago.
R:  Oh, my God.  Huh.  What a culture shock I think, huh?
L:  You know, I grew up in California for nine years and then I went back to Oklahoma for nine years and then I went over there for about six months to do some school and now I'm back.
R:  My goodness gracious. [MN] Well, this is the first time I've done a call.  
L:  This --
R:  I just signed up for these people --
L:  -- is my first time also.
R:  Yeah.  So, I guess, um, we're supposed to talk about, um --
L:  Reality TV shows?
R:  Reality TV.  It's, ah, goodness gracious, ah, what, ah, [MN] see, it's -- I -- I guess, d- -- I don't know if they're recording us or not.
L:  I think they are.
R:  They are?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What -- what, um, what's your feeling about it?  I think that's what they -- the topic was, right?  The feeling of -- of --
L:  Um --
R:  What we watch --
L:  I think what -- I -- when they first came [MN] out I wasn't really popular about it but as more of the shows -- I mean, every single show is a reality show now, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but as more of it -- ah, some of it's interesting.  Some of it goes, ah, way too overboard for me.  Some of it's just too stupid.
R:  Yeah.  I agree.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, they come to a certain, [MN] I -- I guess you might say stupid level in -- in what I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and they think that it's going to hold our interest but the reality I think if you're somewhat brain dead or half drunk may be, like some college kids, huh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- maybe that's okay.  They may have a audience and I think they going for a lot of the twenties, you know, and people in their twenties, they just think, oh, this is really cool but I -- I do think it really gets kind of, um, stale.  I think that's --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that's the word --
L:  It does.
R:  You know.
L:  [MN]
R:  I mean, it's fresh, just like you said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the beginning, it's fresh for a while, you know, but then, um, you gotta have something different so, um, you know, it's interesting now the allure, in other words, like, people like looking because people are naturally curious about other people.  That's human nature and, ah, unlike a, ah, sitcom show that kind of has the same formula and they're actors --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, when you have people who are just people, they're not acting to be somebody else, it is generally far more interesting.  Um ...
L:  That's true but sometimes it's -- it's very, ah, I don't know how to say it, that it's, um, it's ridiculous how people stoop down to their level and --
R:  There you go.
L:  -- act the way they do, just to get their fifteen minutes of fame I guess you can say.
R:  Well, I can totally understand that because, ah, there's always the fantasy that somebody may -- you may get a job somehow.  Somebody may see you or you might have a certain look or, you know, maybe somebody may have some acting ability or something like that, you know, and it's true.  It's true, in a very competitive world it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can see taking a shot at it, you know.  But, um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know, I personally would not want to be on any of the shows at least that I've seen.  [LAUGH] I mean, I don't know, what do you think about Survivor?  I mean, what do you think about going on Survivor?
L:  I honestly don't like that show.  That's the one show that I won't watch.
R:  Yeah, yeah.  Um --
L:  And, um, I -- I like the Bachelor honestly and the Bachelorette.  I like watching women be catty, I guess.  It's -- it's ridiculous but it's funny at times.
R:  Yeah, I -- I get -- you know, I think the Bachelor show, I think that was, like, one of the highest rated ones --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yes.  [MN]
R:  I mean, really, people were really, like, riveted.  "Who's he gonna pick?"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "Who's he gonna pick?"
L:  But not only the Bachelor but the Bachelorette too.  They -- they did -- it's not just one sided and biased.  They also did -- for the girl that picked the guy.
R:  You see I didn't --
L:  I thought that was interesting.
R:  I didn't see that, so --
L:  Oh.
R:  I just saw that original Bachelor one, you know, when --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- he finally picked the girl that I did not pick.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well --
R:  And I think-- 
L:  -- um, the girl that he didn't pick ended up to be the Bachelorette, Trista.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, so she was the Bachelorette but now she -- she was the one that got to pick between -- amongst the twenty five guys.
R:  Wow, so, that's cool.  So, she got something, so, she actually -- it's probably better for her. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, I was reading, I think she got over a million dollars for that show.
R:  How much?
L:  [MN] She's -- over a million.  She was signed over a million, plus all the advertising.  I mean, she's a spokesperson for, like, a few, like, I think Sprite maybe.  Um, so she's popular.
R:  [MN]
L:  But, you know, that's like one in a million probably.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I thought she was -- she was the one I would have chosen for myself.
L:  That's the one I would of liked.  That's the one I liked too.
R:  Yeah, that's kind a cool.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's kinda cool, so, it worked out for her.  That's good.  [LAUGH] You see, this call's informative because --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I would not have known that.  Now you told me about something that I -- I was not aware of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, [MN] that's kind of cool.  [MN] wow. [MN] Yeah, the Survivor shows, um -- oh, oh, oh.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I've heard about this show.  I didn't see it.  I've heard people at work talk about it, ah, I think they call it extreme or something like that.
L:  Extreme Makeover?
R:  Ye- -- ah, Extreme, not makeover.  It's like they do weird things like, um, [LIPSMACK] oh, eat -- eat -- eat spiders or, you know ...
L:  Oh, Fear Factor.
R:  Oh, Fear Factor.  That's what -- sorry, sorry, sorry, Fear Factor.  Now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I have not watched it.  Have you watched that one?
L:  Um, I've watched some parts of it.  Some parts are okay.  It tests your strength and stability and, um, ah, there -- there's some parts that are way too gross where I'm just gonna have to turn my head at times, like, picking rats out of a big pool of water and there's black ones and there's white ones and [MN] you have to, like, um, ah, basically pick the colored ones out of there and there's only, like, ten out of, like, a thousand in a pool of water.
R:  Ahah.
L:  Yeah, so that was a little bit too extreme for me.  
R:  Whoa.  You mean they reach in with their hands, right?
L:  No, no, with their mouths.
R:  Oh, with their mouth.  So, that's [LAUGH] --
L:  They're supposed to go under water.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH].
L:  Then there's a lot of them that, ah, test your extreme height.  You know, like, you know, they take you up and you're supposed to do a number of jobs up in the air while you're spinning or under --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- water holding your breath and stuff like that.
R:  Right. [MN] That --
L:  So --
R:  -- that one, I don't know, does not have much of an interest for me but I've heard about them.  Many people talk about that one, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Pretty strange things, so, um, again, I guess people, they want their fifteen minutes of fame, they're gonna say, "Okay, I'm gonna stick my water under the head -- head under the water and pull out rats", you know, I mean, like [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who -- who --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in their right mind normally do something like that?  [MN]
L:  Ah, it's -- I think it's the chance of winning the money but, I mean, I guess I'm not all for that.  I think you should just work for your money 'cause I don't think you should, you know, be labelled as a person who won a hundred thousand dollars off Fear Factor.  I -- I would rather be the person working for it.
R:  [MN] Hey, y- -- I hope you get it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I hope you --
L:  I'm working on it.
R:  -- find it -- I hope you find it in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] Wow, where -- where they probably still have family values and things like that, ah ...
L:  Well, it's not the family values.  It's y- -- holding your own dignity as a person, I think.
R:  True.
L:  I mean, doing stupid things to get a hundred thousand dollars or you can get a lot more, you know, a lot more -- [MN] personal gain, you know, by knowing that you worked for it and you didn't win it by doing something stupid.
R:  Right.
L:  And something ridiculous that millions of people watched over TV and Internet.
R:  This is -- this is very true.  D- -- well, if you were asked to go on the Bachelorette show, would you go on it?
L:  No, I don't think it would.  I -- I don't think I could stoop -- stoop down that low to be so catty, just -- you know.  [MN] It was ridiculous.  I mean, I watched for the fun of it, er, to watch how people can really act around other people and when they know millions of people are gonna be watching in a few weeks and they would say things that could, you know, jeopardize their future.
R:  Mm. [MN] Yeah, people have to think about their future.  Goodness.  [LAUGH]  That's a good point, isn't it? [MN] Wow. [MN] Well, I don't know if I'm gonna ever be a participant on the show.  I don't even know how these people get -- how they find these people.  [LAUGH] You know.
L:  I think it's, um, I think it's like a worldwide search, like over through the Internet or maybe an eight hundred number.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay, see, I don't use the internet that much so, um, I didn't realise that's how people were connecting for those shows, but maybe that's -- that's how it is.  Mm.  Wow.  So, h- -- did you watch any, ah, reality based TV shows tonight before the call?
L:  No, I haven't.  I'm just in the process of moving back.
R:  Wow.  By the way, it's ten o'clock here in LA.  What time is it where you guys -- where you are?
L:  Um, it's, I think -- what time is it over here?  I, let me see, it's, um, twelve oh eight.
R:  Wow, okay, so you're two hours --
L:  That's two hours ahead.
R:  You're two hours ahead of us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  [MN] Right.
