BUT MEANWHILE SHE'S GOTTEN NOW COMPLICATIONS DUE TO HER HER WEIGHT SHE'S GOT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND A HEART CONDITION AND ALL THAT STUFF  (fe_03_07403-A-0060)
AND IT'S ALL JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT OUR HEART IS AS BIG AS A MUSCLE AND IT'S TRYING TO PUMP BLOOD THROUGH ALL THAT THAT STUFF  (fe_03_07403-A-0061)
SO UH  (fe_03_07403-A-0062)

I WOULD SAY SMOKING OBVIOUSLY 'CAUSE OF THE RISK OF CANCER BUT REALLY IF IF I IF IT WAS AN OPEN ENDED QUESTION I WOULD SAY SMOKING IS ON A TIE WITH UH  (fe_03_07403-A-0067)
WITH OVEREATING  (fe_03_07403-A-0068)
AND THEY SAY DRINKING ALCOHOL UM THEY SAID AS A MATTER OF FACT I JUST HEARD ON A NEWS STORY ONLY LAST NIGHT FOR WOMEN  (fe_03_07403-A-0069)
THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY THEY PICKED IT UP THERE IN PORTLAND BUT THEY THEY SAID TWO DRINKS THEY THEY HAD A STUDY OF UH THEY GAVE UH WOMEN TWO DRINKS  (fe_03_07403-A-0070)
AND UM A DAY AND UH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO UM LOWER THE RISK OF A NUMBER OF THINGS I THINK IT WAS LIKE HEART ATTACKS THAT THAT SORT OF THING  (fe_03_07403-A-0071)
OR IT IT WAS DIABETES IT WAS DIABETES THAT'S RIGHT BUT THEY SAID OF COURSE YOU KNOW MORE THAN TWO DOUBLES YOUR CHANCE OF DIABETES  (fe_03_07403-A-0072)
