REMEMBER THE CHOICES THEY GAVE US  (fe_03_07413-A-0006)

A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM THE ONE THAT STOOD OUT IN MY MIND WAS THE GOSSIPING I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE STOOD OUT MOST WITH YOU  (fe_03_07413-A-0008)
GOSSIPING AND SMOKING OKAY UH WELL I GUESS I'LL GET STARTED UH  (fe_03_07413-A-0010)
I WOULD THINK THE THE ONE THAT'S THE WORST WOULD PROBABLY BE GOSSIPING BECAUSE THAT INVOLVES OTHER PEOPLE NOT JUST YOURSELF  (fe_03_07413-A-0011)
AND UH IF YOU SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AND THEREFORE UM YOU'RE  (fe_03_07413-A-0012)
THEY CAN'T EVEN DEFEND THEMSELVES AND IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING BAD TO YOURSELF IT'S ONE THING BUT TO DO SOMETHING BAD TO SOMEBODY IT'S SOMETHING EL- IS IS WORSE  (fe_03_07413-A-0013)
OH  (fe_03_07413-A-0014)
WHICH ONE  (fe_03_07413-A-0015)
RIGHT WELL SMOKING IS BAD YEAH I DON'T EVEN WHEN I SEE SOMEONE SMOKING I NEVER EVEN LOOK THE OTHER DAY I WAS PASSING BY AND I SAW SOMEONE SMOKING AND I DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AND THEY CALLED MY NAME [LAUGHTER] AND THEN I REALIZED THAT WAS SOMEBODY WHO I KNOW  (fe_03_07413-A-0016)
'CAUSE I JUST ASSUMED THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW DON'T SMOKE AND UH THEN THE PERSON STARTED TALKING TO ME AND THEN I OF COURSE WAS CHASTISING HER FOR SMOKING AND SHE SAID TO ME UH OH  (fe_03_07413-A-0017)
I JUST BUMMED THESE OFF OF PEOPLE I DON'T SMOKE NORMALLY AND I'VE HEARD THAT FROM SO MANY SMOKERS AND A FEW MINUTES LATER AS WE WERE TALKING HER CELL PHONE RANG AND SHE OPENED UP HER PURSE AND SHE HAD A WHOLE PACK IN THERE  (fe_03_07413-A-0018)

JEALOUS OR TRYING TO  (fe_03_07413-A-0023)
PUT ME DOWN TO PROMOTE THEMSELVES  (fe_03_07413-A-0024)
IT'S USUALLY I FIND THAT PEOPLE DON'T GOSSIP UNLESS THEY FEEL THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE BETTER OR WANNA DO SOMETHING WANT TO BASICALLY PUT YOU DOWN TO PROMOTE THEMSELVES  (fe_03_07413-A-0025)
UH NO I'VE HAD GUYS  (fe_03_07413-A-0027)
