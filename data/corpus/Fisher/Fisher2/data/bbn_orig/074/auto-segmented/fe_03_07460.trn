IT'S NICE TO TALK TO YOU  (fe_03_07460-A-0003)
I C- I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE TOO MUCH HELP ON THIS BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY WATCH REALITY BASED T._V.  (fe_03_07460-A-0004)
OTHER THAN THE ONE SHOW WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE AND I DID WATCH THAT QUITE A BIT BUT AS FAR AS SURVIVOR  (fe_03_07460-A-0005)
AND AH THE REST OF THEM I I REALLY DIDN'T GET TOO INVOLVED IN THAT BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND TO SOME DEGREE WHY  (fe_03_07460-A-0006)
WHY PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO THOSE SHOWS  (fe_03_07460-A-0007)
BECAUSE I THINK THEY CAN RELATE TO IT MUCH BETTER  (fe_03_07460-A-0008)
WELL WE'RE IN THE S- WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT [MN]  (fe_03_07460-A-0009)
YEAH AND IT'S  (fe_03_07460-A-0011)

AH  (fe_03_07460-A-0022)
THE REASON I DIDN'T GET INVOLVED IN THAT IS BECAUSE I THINK  (fe_03_07460-A-0023)
ONE NETWORK FOUND A WAY  (fe_03_07460-A-0024)
TO INCREASE RATINGS  (fe_03_07460-A-0025)
WITHOUT  (fe_03_07460-A-0026)
A HEAVY BUDGET  (fe_03_07460-A-0027)
HERE THEY F- THEY FOUND A FORMULA  (fe_03_07460-A-0028)
THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE A PROGRAM  (fe_03_07460-A-0029)
FOR MINIMAL COST AND GET TREMENDOUS RATINGS  (fe_03_07460-A-0030)
AND IT ALL IT DOES IS BOOST THEIR BOTTOM LINE  (fe_03_07460-A-0031)
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT [MN]  (fe_03_07460-A-0032)
BUT TO ME IT'S ALL CONTRIVED  (fe_03_07460-A-0033)
