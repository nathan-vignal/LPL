L:  Hi, this is Linda.
R:  Hi Linda.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good, and yourself?
L:  So, what do you think about the airport security?
R:  [MN] It's good.  Ah, I traveled about two weeks ago. 
L:  Did you?
R:  Yeah, and, um, it's, ah -- well, we always -- I -- I keep getting picked for -- for check- -- for checking my bags and my shoes, and -- and all that stuff --
L:  Really?
R:  -- although it's supposed to be random, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I get -- I get lucky, but actually I don't mind -- it's pretty tight, though.
L:  Mhm, my son just traveled, ah, a coupla weeks ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he said the security was real tight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, it was well worth it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To make sure that nobody's getting on that plane with, ah, any weapons.
R:  That's true --
L:  And --
R:  -- but the thing is, that I was --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- I was -- I was almost about to miss my flight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, that's when it's a little --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  'Cause you could miss your flight, I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they have to check you, I mean, they -- the -- the screeners have nothing to do with the pilots, or -- you know what I'm saying? 
L:  Right.
R:  With the airplane, so --
L:  Well, I know he had to be there two hours --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before he flew.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, [MN] you know, that's a little tough.
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, you have to stand around the airport for two hours before you leave.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I think that -- especially in America right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this is the only thing we can do to -- to prevent having another nine one one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, it's scary in this country now --
R:  That is for sure.
L:  -- especially with flying.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Ah, well, do you think it's picking up?  [several inaudible words] 
L:  Ah, I think it's -- yeah, flying --
R:  I guess so.
L:  -- I think it's picking up a lot --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- compared to what it was --
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  -- but, I don't think it's ever gonna be the same again.
R:  No, I don't think so either.
L:  I think that there's just too many terrorists in this -- in this country, and they're --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- still here, it's just finding them.
R:  It's finding them, I mean -- I mean, I don't know where you live, but I live in, ah, in the [inaudible] area, New York --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, you're not -- you can't just check everybody that goes into the --
L:  I can imagine, yeah.
R:  -- subway, you know, they can't --
L:  I live in Ohio, and, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's not near as bad, but, New York --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's gotta be terrible --
R:  Yeah, we --
L:  -- especially at the airports.
R:  Yes, yeah.
L:  I bet you -- [MN] it wouldn't surprise me if you were in the airport for three or four hours, in New York. 
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  That's awful.
R:  It's just [several inaudible words] -- yeah, it's -- it's, ah, it's a lot of people [several inaudible words]. 
L:  Well, I -- you know, the terrorists have really changed the way our country runs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and the airports is the biggest change.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I think that the security is necessary.  I know my son -- he was going to carry his pocket knife with him, and I said, "You can't do that" --
R:  No, you can't -- they confiscate it.
L:  -- "You cannot do that". [LAUGH]
R:  They confiscate it, yeah.
L:  Right, and that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what I told him, I said, "They'll confiscate that --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- and you'll never see it again".
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I said, "You just leave that here at home", I said, "You're coming home in a coupla weeks".
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I remember they took --
L:  He wasn't --
R:  -- they took like, a really good pair of, ah, tweezers that I had, I was like, "Man" -- if I were -- if I were to --
L:  They took your tweezers?
R:  They -- they had to take 'em.  But, they look like scissors though --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, you know, so, they just -- they kept that and I was like, " [inaudible], I liked that".
L:  Oh, my goodness, I didn't know that they would take things like that.
R:  Yeah, yeah, if they have points -- [several inaudible words] they would -- not tweezers, but the regular kind --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but, the -- there's some that you can also use, like, I guess to pluck your nose hairs, or something [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and they -- they take those.
L:  Well, my goodness, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah, mhm.
L:  That's a new one on me.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I knew that, ah, they would take his pocket knife --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I told him, I said, "You make sure you don't have any pens or pencils, that look like --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- weapons".  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm, mhm --
L:  But --
R:  -- well, you know what?  Finally, they started using, um -- you know what I noticed, they finally started using, um -- ah, u- -- the utensils are now plastic.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Inside of the airplane.
L:  Wow.
R:  Before, you know they used to be like -- they used to use forks that were metal --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I'm like, "Those are weapons, too".  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yes, they would be.
R:  So, they shouldn't be using them in the first place.
L:  Right.
R:  So, they started changing that.
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's one less thing that you have to worry about.
R:  Yeah, but now you gotta pay for food, too. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  [MN] Yeah, so --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] yeah, they started charging for breakfast and lunch, and all that.
L:  Wow, course though --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- there's been so many airlines, just about ready to go out --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because of all this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, so, I -- I imagine that's why they have to charge for everything.
R:  Yeah, they gotta cut down the costs.
L:  Well, I didn't even go in the airport when I dropped him off, because I didn't want to be searched or anything, just dropping him off.
R:  Did your car get searched?  Sometimes they search the cars.
L:  No --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they didn't search, no -- [MN] in Ohio I don't imagine they do that quite as often --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, all I did was pull up to the front -- I mean, they have totally changed Columbus,  Ohio's airport now, where you pull up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, which surprised me, too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because it's totally di- -- I mean, didn't even know where I was going, going into this place now --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and, ah, it's totally different -- you just pull up, I dropped him off and I left --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but I told him, you know, "I would of liked to have gone in" --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and sit with him, but, I said that, "I know I'll end up getting searched or something, just carrying my purse in there", so I said, "It's not worth it to me". 
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I had to leave and just drop him off, and of course, he's nineteen years old, so --
R:  Yeah [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- it wasn't like he can't do it on his own.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Then I asked him how he did with security, he says --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- "Oh, fine".
R:  He was fine.
L:  He said, "They ..." -- they went through his suitcase --
R:  Oh, they did?
L:  -- and, well, he's, um, part Korean --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because his -- I'm his stepmother --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, ah, his real mother was Korean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I, he says, "I know that's why I was picked" --
R:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
L:  -- and I said, "Oh, don't worry about it". 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I said, "You know, d- damn sure that they pick out regular old Americans, too".
R:  Yeah, they do -- they do.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, but you know, but, one can't help but -- but think that sometimes when you get picked too much [LAUGH], you're like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- "Is there a problem?" or something --
L:  They -- they think -- you think that they're picking you out because of your nationality.
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  Look, I [MN] --
R:  -- or, like, something you might be [inaudible].
L:  -- I might be able to understand that if it was Mid Eastern --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but, um, just any nationality now, I -- I don't think they do that.
R:  Well, you know what though -- it's -- that's weird, because then, they -- they gotta look at your name then, because some people just look like -- you don't know what --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people are by looking at them.
L:  That's true --
R:  You know.
L:  -- that's very true, and I think that that goes with anything.
R:  With anything.
L:  Yeah, I mean, anybody can look clean cut --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doesn't mean that they are [LAUGH].
R:  Like, all [MN] the terrorists -- I don't actually look at some of the pictures from, ah, nine eleven --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- some of them looked very clean cut, they looked Western --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they looked European.
L:  Yep.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, I think that --
R:  I mean, you -- you can't just assume that the guy with the beard is gonna -- you know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.  Now, when they went through your suitcases, did they go through everything?
R:  No, they actu- -- actually, you know what?  They weren't very thorough, they just, like, looked here, there -- they closed things back --
L:  Really?
R:  -- [MN] yeah, they were not really, really searching.
L:  You know, I have read this in the -- in the newspapers that they are not thorough --
R:  They're not, yeah.
L:  -- and they -- and that they have found on other ends --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- where they're getting off --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they have found things that should of been found on the first investigation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's -- that's kinda scary.
R:  Yeah, that -- that is, that is.
L:  Yeah, because if they're not being thorough with the searches --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anybody can get through something.
R:  Mhm, like, my purse -- they didn't take the things out of my purse, they just -- you know, they went -- they looked -- they put their -- their hands inside -- and they looked inside and that's it.
L:  Well, I'll be.
R:  You know, what if I had something, like, [MN] -- behind the [MN] -- the seams, you know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Where -- that's where [MN] if I was hiding something, that's where I would put it.
L:  Well, I'll be.  Yeah, 'cause in my purse, I always carry a pair of s- scissors, and I have a little, um, oh, it's like a little knife that has seven or eight different things on it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- my husband told me to stop carrying that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, there's just different things in my purse that, if I'd get stopped I'd -- I know they're gonna find that stuff, but it's not for weapons, it's just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I carry scissors because I'm always cutting coupons, or this, or that --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and if I were in an airport I'd have to empty a lot of things out of my purse [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you figure that, you know, I've even seen them taking, ah, pens and -- ah, pens out of people's purses thinking that they're weapons.
R:  Pens?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, children's pens -- really?
L:  I went through -- went through a court system once, and they asked me what this was, and I pulled it out -- it was my pen.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, yeah, they -- they have, um, xray scanners --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that you put your purses through --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes they don't pick that up that it's a pen, it looks like a weapon.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Course I'm glad that, you know, it's that thorough.
R:  Mm.
L:  I just wish that when they're doing somebody's baggage they would be a little more thorough.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because, well, you know, people are bringing in sweets and things from different countries --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and --
R:  Yeah, you're not supposed to bring those in, right?
L:  No.
R:  Mm.
L:  No, you're not allowed to bring other products --
R:  How --
L:  -- like fruits or --
R:  -- how 'bout cheese, like, cheese?
L:  Now, that I'm not real sure of -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- that's something you would have to ask about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Bef- -- [MN] I would do it before you went over there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, wherever you're going --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because, I don't know how that would be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I imagine it depends on the country that you're going to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah, well, anyway, back to your -- it's good, you know, I guess it's all right -- they could -- they could do better -- some people have gotten by with weapons --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I don't know if you s- -- been seeing the news and stuff, I mean, you know, they have -- you know, it has happened. 
L:  Well, what do you think of the -- the doors to the captain and them --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- being, um, secured now?  Do you feel better?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  They're supposed to have doors to the -- to the galley --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that are secure now --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where people can't just open them and go in.  Does that make you feel better?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  'Cause that's part of the security -- to me it is.
R:  You mean inside of the airplane, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, for -- for the pilot door.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I -- I -- I don't -- I didn't know they were put in already.
