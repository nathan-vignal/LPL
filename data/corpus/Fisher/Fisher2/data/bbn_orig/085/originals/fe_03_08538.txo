L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Janine.
R:  Janine, hi -- my name is Ellen.
L:  Ellen, okay, this is my first time to do one of these [LAUGH].
R:  Really?  That's my second time.
L:  Oh, is it really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]  So, let's see, the topic of the day is airport security.
L:  Yes, uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, I didn't understand the second part -- whether we think it's ...?
L:  It's helpful or not -- if it helps, ah, you know, with the terrorism -- how much [MN] -- I guess they meant how effective ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd probably say, myself -- I travel a lot -- I'd probably say seventy five to eighty percent, in my opinion, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, probably, yeah, I -- I travel down to the Carribean quite a bit, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
R:  Well, I -- I -- I like all this extra security, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think I would, um, you know, personally I would rather wait in an airport for a little longer, you know, waiting time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and get more security than, you know, just -- just go quicker, but -- but be less secure, you know?
L:  Yeah, right, it's so much safer.
R:  I don't mind waiting, more, like, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- spending more time, and more effort and that [MN].
L:  Right, definitely not -- definitely --
R:  So, [inaudible] ...
L:  -- I don't mind at all.
R:  Hm?
L:  I don't mind the wait at all either, to feel safer [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, exactly, so ...
L:  Anyways ...
R:  And, I do think they -- they have to invest, ah, in like even -- like, in more machines and, ah, you know, more effective machines --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- to really make sure, you know, to really check the luggage, and, ah ...
L:  Yeah -- yeah, I think that's a good idea, especially for the checked luggage, I think, um --
R:  Yeah, especially for the checked luggage [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, we're just starting that.  I -- I usually travel through Dallas Fort Worth, and I believe they've just started, ah, using the xray --
R:  Really?
L:  -- yeah, the xray machines on the checked luggage.
R:  Just now?  Wow.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.  [MN] 
R:  Well, in New York -- I'm from New York, so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  In New York they had it for, I think for a while now.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I imagine.
R:  So, it's, ah [SIGH] -- it's good to have -- where are you from?
L:  Oh, Fort Worth, Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Were you -- ah, I'm -- I'm gonna take a wild guess -- are you originally from Russia?
R:  Yes, uh-huh. 
L:  Okay, okay, I have a client that's from Russia -- your -- your voice sounded similar to hers.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, okay -- oh, that's good.
L:  Her last name's Cherkeski.
R:  Yeah, that sounds Russian.
L:  Yeah, anyway.
R:  [inaudible] you're interesting.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] All right, ah ...
L:  Yes, I definitely feel safer, yeah, even, ah, like, when I go to Mexico and places like that, they even check things, you know, coming back to the US, ah ...
R:  Oh, yeah, that -- 
L:  Anyways ...
R:  -- that's really good.
L:  Yeah, which I don't think theirs is as good as ours [LAUGH], but I -- like you say, I don't mind waiting for 'em to go through everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, anyway ...
R:  But, actually, when, um -- [LIPSMACK] when I was coming back to New York [MN] the other week, I -- they didn't check my luggage on the way back, so I was a little surprised.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah, ah, well, in terms of, you know, when I landed back in New York --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I had some, like, luggage with me --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, which was not checked, so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I thought they would check it, but they didn't [LAUGH].
L:  Huh.
R:  So, I guess -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't know, I guess ... it's better to check it more when you're going on an airplane, than when you --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh
R:  -- get off.
L:  But, you have a good point, too.  I never thought of that.  If you were bringing something back into the country --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you could blow up the airport, or something, yeah.
R:  Exactly -- you surely could, so --
L:  Yeah, huh.
R:  -- I think that's like, I think where they could improve, you know, possibly.
L:  Yeah, like, maybe in customs, yeah -- xray the incoming luggage, yeah.
R:  Yeah, in customs exactly because they don't have anything in customs --
L:  Right.
R:  -- pretty much, you just -- you show your passport, then you go [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, they just wave --
R:  Like --
L:  -- me through usually, yeah.
R:  -- who knows who's in your -- what's in your bag, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, huh.
R:  You know what I mean?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's -- I just don't feel -- I don't know -- I don't know -- personally, I don't feel safe --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I -- I wish they would do a little more.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Of that, yeah.
R:  You know?  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What do you think?
L:  I agree totally, I guess I'd never thought of that --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in coming back in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you could blow up the airport, or [LAUGH] ...
R:  Exactly.
L:  Oh, my heavens.
R:  You could just, like, go near one of the gates, and I don't know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who knows?  I mean ...
L:  Yeah, that's a good point too, huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Definitely, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Yeah, I just had surgery on my ankle, so --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- they put metal in there, so I'm waiting to see if that's gonna set off the detectors [LAUGH].
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Ah, that's gonna --
R:  Wow, is -- is that --
L:  -- be interesting, yeah.
R:  Hm?
L:  That will be interesting to see if it sets off the detector --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- you know, the one you walk through.
R:  I hope it doesn't, because [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- then you'll have ex- -- to do all this explaining, like ...
L:  [MN] Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Is that like, um -- is that like a knee replacement surgery, or ...?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, no I broke my ankle, and I had, ah -- ah --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- put the -- a pin and a plates --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- in there, yeah, because it was a spiral fracture, anyways ...
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Mm.
L:  Yeah, anyways ...
R:  Well, they also say, like, that, if you have a pacemaker --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that also sets it off [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, does it?  Oh, I [several inaudible words] ...
R:  You know what a pacemaker is?
L:  Right, for the heart --
R:  Yeah, mhm --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  So, a lot of things can set it off, I guess.
L:  Yeah, I guess so --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I guess so -- so, [MN] is it pretty tight up there, like, as far as, ah --
R:  In New York?
L:  Yeah, waiting [NOISE] and everything, like -- do they wave the wand over you, and all of that, or ...?
R:  Ah, the -- the what?  I'm sorry.
L:  Do they, ah -- like, in New York -- like, here when I leave Dallas, Fort Worth airport --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they'll, ah -- you walk through, you know, the thing around you, I guess and it -- if there's metal on you it'll set it off --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- and then you put your carry on through the xray [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then after that they have -- at our airport at least, you put your arms out and they -- you know, they put the wand type thing over you.
R:  Yes, exactly.
L:  Yeah, okay.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah --
R:  Also --
L:  I like that, yeah.
R:  -- also -- yeah, it's very thorough --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, also in New York --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they want you to take off your shoes.
L:  Yeah, they have me do that sporadically.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's maybe every other time I fly --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
R:  I guess that's -- did they start doing it since that -- the shoe guy -- the sh- -- you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Remember that guy from -- was he from England or something?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
R:  He had something in his shoe.
L:  Yeah, he was trying to set it on fire, and everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  He was, yeah.
R:  So, that's a good idea, too [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it definitely is -- definitely, so ...
R:  Ah, same should be done with the he- [inaudible] [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, that -- that should too -- that's not a bad idea whatsoever.
R:  I guess.
L:  That's not at all, so ...
R:  Yeah, so, how did you hear about this, you know, survey?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, my mother, ah, found out about it on -- online I guess --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, yeah, she ...
R:  Yeah, me too [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] and see, I can't work right now, after my ankle, so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm, like, "Okay, I'll make some extra money with that", so ...
R:  Yeah, oh.
L:  Anyways ...
R:  So, did you have surgery on both of your ankles, or ...?
L:  Oh, well, one was a minor break and the other one was the one they had to operate on, it was a lot worse.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah, I won't be traveling for a little while [LAUGH].
R:  What's that?  Oh, will not be traveling.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, so, have you traveled to Russia?  Like, in the last --
R:  Yes, [inaudible] I did, um, one time only.
L:  Yeah, so, is security good there also, or ...?
R:  Um, not as good as here, I would say [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  Wow.
R:  I think -- I think they are more relaxed about it.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  I don't know why, but they are [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, well, I guess for our [several inaudible words] --
R:  Maybe that -- maybe that's because they didn't have September eleventh there.
L:  Yeah, I guess so.
R:  You know what I mean?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Although one time in, ah, Jamaica, I had like tiny, tiny little one inch, ah, tweezers, you know, I was headed back to the US and they took those away from me, and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- and in a way I thought, "Well, golly, you know, they -- [inaudible] think I'm gonna hurt ...", but, then I guess in a way it makes you feel safe, so ... I don't know.
R:  Wow, tweezers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Was that in your carry on luggage, or ...?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But they were still so tiny, but [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [several inaudible words] ...
R:  See, I guess you would be able to put it in, um, checked luggage, but not -- not the carry on.
L:  Right, right, yeah -- yeah, like ...
R:  I put all my scissors and my sharp objects in the checked luggage [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  Just so that they don't take it away.
L:  Yeah, another thing that would make me feel safer is if they, um, checked people better for lighters and matches, 'cause I smoke and always have lighters and matches, and, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, and they've never taken them away, or anything [several inaudible words] ...
R:  That's true, hm.
L:  Yeah, 'cause in the wrong hands that would not be good.
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  I never even thought of that.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Because it's, just such a small object, it's easy to hide somewhere, I guess.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, oh, definitely, but I go through with 'em all the time [LAUGH].
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh. [MN] 
R:  Wow.
L:  Oh.
R:  I guess they didn't think of it yet [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I guess not -- I guess not -- [several inaudible words]
R:  Or, they don't feel it to be the --
L:  Yeah [inaudible].
R:  -- danger.
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, [inaudible].
R:  Huh, I don't know.
L:  I have no idea on that one.
R:  Well, I -- I was in London recently and over there they had [SIGH] a lot of security checks --
L:  Yeah, uh-huh.
R:  -- very, very secure [LAUGH].
L:  Very thorough.
R:  You know, Lon- London Heathrow Airport?
L:  Yeah, uh-huh, yeah --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah.
R:  That was pretty good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, lots of -- lots of waiting, lots of lines, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, they did a good job I thought.
L:  Yeah, the worst one I've been through, although it was the most thorough, I felt very safe -- I think it was just [SIGH] -- I think it was just two months after September the eleventh that I was going through Miami, and that ...
