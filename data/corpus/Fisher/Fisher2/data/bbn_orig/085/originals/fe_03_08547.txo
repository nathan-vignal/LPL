L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  I'm fine, thank you -- this is Caroline Connor.
L:  My name is Debbie, and I'm calling from Boston.
R:  Oh, I'm in Atlanta.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well, Marietta actually, not Atlanta, but ...
L:  Okay, um --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I don't, um, travel by airplane myself, but, um, I guess to discuss if all the stuff is helping, you know, with the terrorist --
R:  Right.
L:  -- my opinion would be it seems like, if they wanted to do something -- a terrorist -- they have, like, inside help there -- at -- at the airport --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I think it's cutting the chances down of getting a weapon or a gun, definitely --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, [MN] I -- I'd say it reduces it, but I -- I don't think it could totally prevent it.
R:  No, I don't think it will -- I don't think anything will totally prevent terrorists, really -- if they want to do it, they'll find a way, you know, they -- they're -- they have no regard for life, or anything, so, it doesn't matter if they're killed or whatever, but, ah, yes, I'm with you, I think it does help a little bit, but it doesn't -- it's not gonna prevent it all together, but, I do think it has, ah, cut down, so -- but, I --
L:  Cut down, right, on the getting weapons, and -- and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- knives, and explosives.
R:  Right, things like that, so ...
L:  And, I would think that [MN] -- anyway, my guess would be, they wouldn't try the plane thing again because, I mean, they -- they know -- they watch our news and they know that it would be pretty much, almost impossible.
R:  Well, I --
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  -- I think that's true, they're -- they're -- they're -- in fact here in Atlanta, they're now asking you to board, ah, go through the gates barefooted.  If you --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if you put your shoes on the, um -- [LIPSMACK] ah, carrier thing, then they -- they won't check you as closely 'cause -- because of the, ah, terrorist [inaudible] that they caught with the bomb in the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- shoes, so, they're saying it -- it will speed you up if you go through barefooted.
L:  I didn't know that.
R:  Well, they're -- it's just recently started, and I think that, you know, I mean, I -- maybe it does speed it up, I don't know --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- but it does seem like it's carrying it a little bit far to ask to go through barefoot, you know?
L:  What are they gonna have people go through nude next time?
R:  [LAUGH] I -- right.
L:  Like, a private area.  Who knows, right?
R:  Right --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- it -- if --
L:  -- I'm so- --
R:  It is getting ridiculous, some things, but -- that I do, I mean I'm -- I don't go by plane much either --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, ah, I -- I do think it's people who travel all the time, and I have a lot of my family who do a lot of business traveling, and ah, they don't seem to mind it at all, but, um, as -- but, you know you can drive, ah, so much faster -- a lot faster than if you, ah, go by plane, 'cause you got to be there two hours early.
L:  Right.
R:  [MN]
L:  Actually, it's funny, I, um -- I h- -- I manage a transportation company --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, [MN] ninety nine percent of our business is bringing people over to Logan Airport --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, they're always coming out with --mailing us things to give to our drivers and, you actually -- when you're waiting in there, ah, in the limousine lot, you have to have all the doors and -- and the, ah -- we have a van -- a van service --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you have to have the doors open on the side --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and the back.
R:  Right.
L:  In -- you know, the back door, and like, when we go over -- course the van's empty, 'cause there's no luggage in it or anything, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they check.
R:  Right.
L:  They come around and they're like, "Open your doors -- open your doors", like you could have somebody hiding under there or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it -- it a- -- it affects a little bit like that, and also with the customers who call in, they're like, "Oh, you know, well, it takes twenty minutes to get there, but they want us, there, you know -- it's a nine o'clock flight w- -- you know, we have to be --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- be there at seven, you know, so you better pick us up at six".
R:  Right.
L:  [inaudible] three hours.
R:  Right, and then -- and then you got three hours coming back too, so, ah --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- I mean, you know, these round trips, so, it's -- it's easier to drive -- my daughter just recently drove to [several inaudible words] because it was just -- it was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- about an hour [MN] more and she could drive, rather than take the plane, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, it -- I think that, um, anyway, ah, you know, not -- you know, hindsight's twenty twenty -- I think they should of been doing this all along.
R:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
L:  It seemed just like, anybody could walk in there, with anything.
R:  Right.  I have a, ah, daughter in law who li- -- works at, ah, Atlanta Airport --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, ah, she said, you'd be surprised the people that just have -- get in there with no, you know, they're not have access, but they're there, and how they get in, I don't know.
L:  Right, 'cause some of these people --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, they were getting the uniforms, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, they get one of those mechanic uniforms and they're out there working on the plane, they could put a device in there.
R:  Right.
L:  And, same thing with the cafeterias --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, there was some issue about that here, so, I think anybody who wants to do anything will figure out a way.
R:  Well, I think they will to, but I -- but, personally I do think it is -- is helping some, I don't think it's gonna stop it all together, but I think it is helping planes.
L:  It -- it seems like it --
R:  But, it --
L:  -- I'm sorry to cut you off [LAUGH].
R:  'Scuse me -- [inaudible] if there's a lot of inconvenience for the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- customer, you know, so ...
L:  Yeah, because ninety nine percent of the people going through are honest people.
R:  Right.
L:  And, we're the one- -- you know, the people being --
R:  Being --
L:  -- inconvenienced.
R:  Right.
L:  And, those other snakes -- they'll find another way to get through, but --
R:  But, that's what they want -- that's the reason they're doing it --
L:  right.
R:  -- is to inconvenience us all, so ...
L:  And I -- I think one thing, is that, ah, like I said -- the way it is now, [MN] this should have been the norm --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, you had heard all these things, how informants and stuff had -- had said, you know, that -- you know, there's talk of this, people are sneaking through the airport, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, it was like, on Dateline and stuff, there was -- they -- they knew something was gonna happen --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, they -- it slipped through the system.
R:  Right.
L:  They had a -- you know, but, I don't think they'll try the airplanes again, I think it'll be something else, because it's too obvious.
R:  Well, I don't think they'll, ah, try the major airlines, but they might try smaller airplane, you know?
L:  Or, they could try Amtrak -- anything.
R:  Crowded, or -- or, yeah, anything -- anything they can do, but, ah -- but, like I say, I -- I personally think it might have helped a little bit, but, ah -- but, it's not going to stop it all together, so, I don't know -- [inaudible] --
L:  But, at least there won't be any other, like, even just a regular hijacker, who's not a terrorist --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's harder to get on there now, and also --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the new doors they're putting on the cockpit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I couldn't believe that you could just kick those doors open.  They were very thin they were saying --
R:  Right.
L:  -- yeah, so now they have that, and I definitely think they should be able to have weapons up there.
R:  Right.
L:  And --
R:  And I -- I was -- I'm like you, I didn't realize they could g- -- I thought it was inaccessible to the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- cockpit, without, you know, without [several inaudible words] --
L:  But, it's just like a -- a regular little door.
R:  Right.
L:  You could -- that -- you know --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- barge it in, shoot the lock off, whatever, and, um, you know, but, then again, we weren't thinking of that as a crime zone. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right.
L:  But, now we are.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right --
L:  But, may- --
R:  -- we definitely think, every time we go on an airplane, so ...
L:  Maybe now it's a lot --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- safer all around for everybody, just, even a regular hijacker with a gun or something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they'll probably prevent a lot of other things from happening --
R:  Right, I hope so.
L:  -- even if it isn't -- um, have you done all three of your calls on this?
R:  No, I have not.
L:  Well, I thought I did three --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the last one I did, but, I -- I got a call waiting came in --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I -- I [inaudible] remember reading that if you get a call waiting it cancels out the call.
R:  Oh, well, now that's what happened to me, then -- they told me yesterday, I guess, 'cause I was talking to this gentleman from Los Angeles, and -- and I just got cut off, you know? 
L:  See -- 'cause --
R:  -- and so, that's -- I wondered what happened [several inaudible words] --
L:  This is my fourth call.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Um, and, I was talking to somebody last time and then the call waiting beeped through, and then she goes, "Oh, did you just get call waiting, 'cause I think they ...", you know, I guess they're probably listening to your voice pattern and stuff like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and if the call waiting comes through that changes your whole way you're talking, 'cause then you're like --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, because then you're like, "Oh, no, call waiting just came through", [LAUGH] you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, I -- 'cause I, um, this is really, I think my fourth call, 'cause I got, ah, reality TV --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I got airport security, I got sports, and I forget what the first one I got.
R:  The sports is the one I had, ah, or striking sports and, ah, I did- -- it just beeped and -- and I was cut off, it didn't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it didn't -- didn't sound like, you know, and of course, I didn't know how to contact the person -- I kept saying, "Hello, hello, hello ...", and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so, ah, I don't -- I don't know what happened there, but, ah -- yeah --
L:  I -- yeah, 'cause I know this is my fourth one, that's why when they just called me I was shocked --
R:  Right.
L:  -- 'cause I -- I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I did -- the other one was definitely my third one, and I was saying to the person, "Oh, this is my last one" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK] -- oh, it was hobbies -- hobbies was the other one.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  So, this is my fourth one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hobbies, sports, reality TV and airport security, so, I don't know, unless they're letting people do more than three, I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  No, they said -- they -- when they -- when I talked to 'em the other day, they said -- 'cause my son was getting these calls, and I called to stop it, because he's not hardly ever here --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, ah, so, I said, "I want to get off this list, you know", and they called me back wanting to know why, you know, and I said, "Well, I don't how I got on the list to start with", and they told me, and, ah, but I said, "Well, he's not -- he's not ever here, you know", and --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [several inaudible words] I mean, you call and he's not here, and, so -- and then they said, "Well, you wanna be on the list?". [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you g- -- I guess it's a good thing, I, yeah --
R:  So, that's -- that -- you know, I said, "Well, sure, you know, if it's not gonna cost me but thirty minutes of my time, so ...", yeah.
L:  I'd like to see the results of the study if they would --
R:  I would too.
L:  -- to just -- to see what they were -- they were -- they're not gonna tell you exactly what they were looking for, 'cause it might influence the way you talk.
R:  Right --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- well, they -- I -- they might not like us talking about this either right now [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, that's okay, but --
R:  But, ah -- but, ah --
L:  -- no, we -- we talked about it, we came to a good conclusion that we thought it was --
R:  Right.
L:  -- helping somewhat, but, it wouldn't totally deter.
R:  It's not gonna totally -- 
L:  A rotten egg.  [LAUGH].
R:  No, I don't think anything will, so ...
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  If -- if a terrorist -- like I say, since they have no regard for human life, you know, it  -- it doesn't matter, and if they're gonna kill babies, and -- and which they do, and, ah --
L:  Whatever, yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- and themselves too, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, what point can you do, I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- strap bombs to yourself, I mean, they're --
L:  It's crazy.
R:  -- there's no way you're gonna, you know, stop it, so [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, that nine one one thing was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life, I -- everytime I see it I keep going, "Can you believe that happened?", I would, you know, I hope to, god forbid, never see a thing like that again -- that was --
R:  And, I was watching it live when it happened and boy, it was -- it was bad [several inaudible words] --
L:  I was petrified.
R:  Right [inaudible] --
L:  Because first it was the New York, and then they're like, oh, here's another one New York, and then when ...
