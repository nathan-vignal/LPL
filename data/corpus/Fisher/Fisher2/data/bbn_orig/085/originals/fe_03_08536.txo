R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, this is Kim.
L:  This is Rita ... and I am in Michigan.
R:  You're from where?
L:  Michigan.
R:  Oh, I'm in Florida.
L:  Okay, all right -- airport security.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [inaudible] we think --
R:  Oops, are you there?  I'm not gonna take that -- they said not to take the call waiting [SIGH].
L:  Oh.
R:  Anyway, um, I guess it can mess up the timeframe or something like that, but --
L:  Huh.
R:  I haven't flown since all the terrorist thing, but, that wouldn't stop me [SIGH] -- I guess what -- what was the topic?  Something about airport security?
L:  If hiring more, um, airport security -- if we felt that, um, decreases the chance of terrorist attack.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm gonna have to go with I don't believe [SIGH] that hiring, um, more airport security --
R:  No.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] 
R:  I think if they're -- if they're going to --
L:  They're going to.
R:  -- to do something, they're going to do something --
L:  They're going to.
R:  -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  I think it may decrease, um, [LIPSMACK] um --
R:  It might throw a little curve in their plan.
L:  Yeah, oh, yeah -- maybe --
R:  But --
L:  -- a bit of curve, but, I don't think it's really gonna, um -- see, because [SIGH] everything depends on how good the people are that you hire.
R:  Right.
L:  Now, if you hire the best of the best then I do believe that we could det- -- you know, deter -- if people, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- did --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if people followed the guidelines, and, you know [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, were properly trained, then, maybe it would deter some terrorist attacks, but I think when people have it out for you, they're gonna find a way.
R:  And they did [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah, true.
R:  -- you know, even though we thought that we had, you know, the best security, even in the, um, Twin Towers --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- you know, but, there's just no way, you know --
L:  No way at all.
R:  -- but then, of course that's airplanes and we're talking about airport security, but, [SIGH] no, [SIGH] then I guess -- I guess what now, they're thinking about letting pilots carry guns.
L:  I'm like, you know, yeah, and it -- as -- as soon as a bullet goes through --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- airplane and it depressurizes, and it goes down -- you know what I mean?  It's just -- it's just bad -- it's bad -- I think that the -- the best, um, reaction, um, was when the pilots of the plane that actually went down in the open field --
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah, I think that that's how it should always be handled.
R:  Right, right --
L:  Because --
R:  -- yeah, a coupla more like that -- of course --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we don't need anymore like that, but --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- once the terrorists see that we're gonna fight back, you know?
L:  You hit it -- like, even the scaredy cat pilot who's just, you know?
R:  Oh, right, exactly.
L:  Who's -- who's got tunnel vision, and -- and has stereotypes, you know, Arab Americans, you know what I mean?
R:  Right.
L:  People who looks like they might fit whatever the profile they think it is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- man, you're just asking for trouble, because I know someone who would walk into -- and this is silly -- a Coney Island and thought that the guys were Arab, but they're Greek --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, like, see, you can't -- everyone can't even differentiate --
R:  Oh, right, you're right.
L:  -- people's own nationalities, and it -- you know, they're -- they're Greek Americans --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just -- but, just because they may have family over in another country --
R:  Right.
L:  -- doesn't mean that they're, you know --
R:  No, because a lot --
L:  -- [inaudible].
R:  -- of 'em that are here, and, um, that live here now, they're -- not that they're on one side or the other, but, they know, you know, the things that -- that has been done, what and [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?  So ...
L:  No, I -- I -- I don't agree with -- with, um -- with -- with all of our foreign policies --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I know that there's a cause and an effect --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to everything, so, I do believe that, um, it's sad to say, a lot of the things that have transpired -- I can understand why some people would feel the way they do about Americans.
R:  Right.
L:  I can, you know, see that point of view, but, at the same time I -- if I had that -- I wouldn't personally hurt someone else --
R:  Right. [NOISE] 
L:  -- because I just don't believe that that's, you know, but as far as airport security, um, let's see -- on September the eleventh I was pregnant with my second child --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and I was starting to write in his journal and I looked on the TV and that's when I saw the Twin Towers --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- fall down, and I was like, "I cannot journal" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "I c- -- I refuse to journal this event on this day" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because this is a sacred time for me.
R:  I have an in home, ah, licensed daycare, and, um, just for some odd reason, about eight thirty that morning -- and we always have it on Sesame Street, or Nickelodeon, or something like that, for the kids, you know, they all get here first thing in the morning, and sure enough, for some [SIGH] odd reason I had that gut feeling, I'm like, "Well, I'll just flick to CNN, you know, I haven't heard the news in a while -- let's just see ..." -- you know I catch up on it once a month [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they work -- they worked in with the times, and sure enough, man, I seen it plain as day, I mean --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- just turn it on like, eight thirty, eight thirty five, and I think the first one went through at like, eight forty eight, or, um, you know, right about quarter to nine --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that was just so ironic, you know, that --
L:  It's just crazy, 'cause I don't personally believe that, um, that -- that, ah, the people who need to be profiled are the people who -- who are being profiled --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for some reason, you know what I mean?  
R:  Right.
L:  The -- the person that -- that you're always looking for isn't the one that you're always looking for.
R:  Right. [SIGH] 
L:  So, I think --
R:  Well, I think, even like down here in Orlando -- the airport security there, um, I -- I've -- I haven't flown since, but I've been through there to pick up people, um, that have come in here to visit us -- family members -- but, um, there's -- then the security is a little bit more --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, I don't mind, I mean, I personally, you know, i- if I was to fly out I would be there two hours -- an hour and a half to two hours before and I would expect that, you know, for them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to go through everything, or -- or, you know, take the time, you know, and -- and it should [SIGH] probably have been that way all along --
L:  All along.
R:  -- you know, but we're so slack as Americans --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then when something like this happens, they go opposite, and then they go overboard, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, if -- if we would have had a happy medium all along, and have our -- our um, what?  Our, um, fences up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, our walls up, just in case anything like this could of happened, but, you never think it's gonna happen to us.
L:  Yeah, just in case, I mean, you -- [MN] I -- I mean, I would of thought that as an issue of national security that somebody would of thought of this.
R:  Yeah, you're right.
L:  But, you know, that's the -- that's -- that's just us taking things for --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- for --
R:  I'll tell you what --
L:  -- granted.
R:  -- they're thinking about it now.
L:  I know they are --
R:  You know?
L:  -- I know they are --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know, it's just, um -- it's just one of those things I -- I'm -- I'm a firm believer that when it's your time to go, it's your time to go --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- be it in the air, be it on the ground, be it, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- in a secure environment, or just, at home in the bed asleep --
R:  Oh, well, everything happens for a reason --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it either -- you know, you hate to see other people that have passed away, you know, from the Twin Towers, and from, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the air, um, you know, the airplanes, you know, that's just the sad part, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they picked the airplanes that were going from New York and stuff to, ah, all the way to California -- the ones that would have the most gas, you know, in them, and oh, that -- it was just heartbreaking, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, if it's your time, it's your time, and I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think that there's any kind of security that [MN] can, you know, unless --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they knew it -- knew it --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, before it was going to happen, then they could of, you know, maybe -- not, [MN] ah, prevented it, but they could of stopped and [inaudible] them, or -- or if -- I don't know if they would of shot the plane down, you know, first --
L:  Right.
R:  -- with the Americans on there, I don't know, but, um --
L:  I, look -- I'm even up for that, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- honestly, I am, I'm --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, you know, if, um -- if there's someone out there who's funding all these terrorist attacks, and whatever -- what -- if -- if they don't give a damn, I don't give a damn, let's just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know what I mean?  Just blow it up.
R:  Right, right.
L:  Blow it up, because two hundred and fifty people --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's, um, better than --
R:  Or, was it four --
L:  -- five hundred thousand.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't really know how many people died, and it is [MN] -- I mean, certainly sad --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- certainly, you know --
R:  Oh [MN] dead, but how --
L:  Certainly --
R:  -- how 'bout the ones missing -- they'll never recover --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- they'll never find them, I think that's worse --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, I mean, granted -- thank the lord that some of 'em [inaudible] had bodies to bury, but oh, can you imagine the -- the wives or the husbands --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that didn't even -- you know, didn't have a chance --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- you know, or even say goodbye, or stuff like that --
L:  Mm mm.
R:  -- I mean, but --
L:  I'd be -- I told my husband, "Do not call me".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "Do not call -- get out".
R:  Yeah, exactly --
L:  "Get out".
R:  "Run" -- you know?  But, yeah ... 
L:  "You -- you -- you expend all your energy trying to --"
R:  I don't know, I mean, I don't know if the pilots could have had guns, or if the pilots could have, you know, been trained in -- what?   Martial arts, if the --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if the pilots could have been trained in anything else, or the stewardess, but, like -- like, you said, you know, I mean, if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen -- they're gonna --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- try no matter what, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and -- and we could go down fighting, but, it's not gonna prevent it totally --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, I mean --
L:  No, it -- it's not hindsight, it's twenty twenty, it's --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I don't necessarily think that there's a whole lot that they could of done because people are so sophisticated, you know, once --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] once you see something on, like, TV --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in a movie -- it's already been done --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- do you know what I mean?   Someone has already conceptualized it --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- and thought of it, so, they've fig- -- they -- they figured on how to --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- smuggle things onto the airplanes, and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and get past the, um -- the metal detectors and that's -- that's like the only thing that -- that we really have, short of a search --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- short of frisking every single person that walks through, and I mean, shoot --
R:  Right.
L:  -- look at -- look at -- look at James Bond, you know what I mean?
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  All that sophisticated --
R:  I know.
L:  -- stuff that he has -- there's got to be --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's -- I -- I don't know, it's just one of those things that -- I don't really think that you could prepare --
R:  Right.
L:  -- for every --
R:  I -- I think that --
L:  -- every scenario.
R:  -- they -- they can be on their toes --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, with modern technology and modern sciences, and try to think of everything that they can do to prev- --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- not prevent, but -- but, what if this scenario happened?  What if this scenario happened?  Or, this other scenario?  And --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and do that, I mean, some -- you know, I'm sure they probably are, but, man, some of them people need to get off their rear ends, and, ah --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- do more, if you ask me.
L:  -- it's -- it's gonna take -- it's gonna take, you know, generations to --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah.
L:  -- to -- to --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- repair the mindset that --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- other folks have of Americans --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know what I mean?  
R:  Right.
L:  Because they -- they are, um, conditioned, day in and day out to just [MN] -- despise us, hate us, you know what I mean?
R:  Right -- oh, I know --
L:  They --
R:  -- and even worse now [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- you know, 'cause we -- we go over to whatever country we feel like --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and we impose our beliefs on them and then --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, my -- my husband's like, well, "What if Saddam says, you know 'I don't like how Bush is running it'".
R:  Oh, yeah, exactly.
L:  "Let's go over there".
R:  They could easily invade us, you know?
L:  Oh, like, that would just -- that would just not be good --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and nothing about that is good, so, I believe it's one of those things that you just can't -- that they're just not gonna, you know, be prepared -- be prepared for, I mean, 'cause first off ...
