R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  I'm fine, my name's Kemmie.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Kemmie, and you are?
R:  Kemmie?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm Revka.
L:  Oh, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too, so, what are we talking about?
L:  Um, the salaries of -- we're talking about sports a- athletes, and do we feel that -- do they -- do we feel they deserve their salaries [inaudible].
R:  Well, what do you think?
L:  Well, um, I believe that -- that's it's enormously high, but then we have to think they're -- they're -- they're getting a perc- -- they're basically getting a percentage of the people that come to see them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, like -- so, for example, okay, they fill up, like -- the balls, or something like that, okay, they fill up the stadium -- pretty much, those tickets are expensive as heck, and then to market it, and then, like, the, um, the money that they get from the publicity or what not, they're basically making a portion of all that money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I mean, the money is not really putting us in debt anyway, it's just -- it's -- they -- they're getting that specifically from ah, the percentage that they make from playing those games, and the people that show up, and then whatever extra they make from the, um, promotional stuff that they do, I mean, I think it's high, but, there's been a percentage of whatever they do [LAUGH].
R:  Do you think it's too high, though?  I mean, don't you think, like, sometimes doctors should be making more than professional athletes, because, even though professional athletes are in the entertainment business, and they're entertaining people, doctors are saving lives, and doctors are, like, one of the most important elements of society, when, I mean, if you take away basketball, yeah, people will be upset, but, I mean, it's not the biggest deal.  I mean, like, how much --
L:  I -- I don't think -- I don't think it's a big deal at all, but, then again, like, [MN] um, doctors are being paid by the percentage of the insurance, and because so much ins- -- I mean, insurance is cheap, it's like, not expensive as going to a game, or, I mean, paying to see the doctor's not as expensive as going to the game -- thank god it's not, but, doctors are also making a percentage of [MN] the people that they bring in, and the people that they see, and the, um, surgery that they perform, or -- or what not, like, I believe that that money should go to them, like I -- I have no problem of that, like, I'm a biology major, but [SIGH] I mean, it's where the money is at, that's what it is -- I --
R:  I know, I know, I -- I totally understand and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's all because of entertainment, like, the entertainment stars of today are making the most money out of everybody and [MN] I don't know, like, I just -- I don't see it as being equal, with like, what other people are doing in this world, yet, everybody, like, condones, this, like, ability to get these high salaries, and, I mean, it just -- it annoys me so much, that, like, these, like, nineteen year old stars are more -- like, are richer than, like, the most genius people, you know?  It's like, it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- there's no balance of what they're giving back to society, like -- like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I don't know, like, I don't ever think there can be to be honest, because obviously the entertainment business is a huge business that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is going to be making a lot of money, and, like, [MN] a doctor provides a special -- specialized care, so it's not like -- you can't compare them, but I mean, I just -- I feel like there's such imbalance, I don't know.
L:  Yeah [MN], and to me there always has been a -- there always is gonna be, because, it's like, it's -- [MN] it's like, granted, the smartest people are not playing basketball, but the people that market them have to be smarter too, because they know what the people want, and they know how to gross the amount of money they're [inaudible] to pay these people, like, athletes, and, um, actors, and things like that -- back in the day, they weren't [LAUGH] rich at all.  Writers, th- they didn't make money, it was like, priest, and, you know, people in politics, and, um, even -- yeah, even doctors at one point that were making money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, I mean, it's always gonna change, like, what, ah -- twenty, thirty years from now it might be completely different, and then we might -- it still might affect us negli- negatively in the future -- we might have to pay really high insurance costs to support, um, these doctors making a high amount of money, like, it's always gonna shift --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the [inaudible] always gonna shift [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, I know --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- what do you think about --
L:  Hm?
R:  What do you think about the professional athletes then -- them being accused of crimes and then getting off because they're professional athletes?
L:  I -- I don't condone that at all, like, [MN] not at all --
R:  Do you that'll ever -- do you think that'll ever resolve?
L:  [SIGH] I think our criminal system is so messed up today, that, like -- I have no idea, because there are -- there's innocent people in jail right now, I mean, and people that actually commit crimes are getting off, it -- it -- I -- there needs to be a balance of power, until that happens, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's pretty much gonna be behind in whatever we do right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that's what I feel, 'cause, ah, I mean, the -- it's like, there's so many laws that are supposed to protect, um, the innocent, well, then there are so many laws that also protect the criminal, so ...
R:  Yeah, oh, for sure.  I mean, I think -- it sickens me, you know, to think that people get off just because of their status, or just because of who they are --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't know, and maybe it does have to do with that they're, like, so rich and they're g- [LAUGH] -- they're getting these huge salaries, so, people don't wanna, like, get in their way, you know?  But ...
L:  Right.
R:  So, I [MN] --
L:  Because the thing is that, the reason why they get off is that, taking them to court also takes money from the government, like, it would bleach the system of our money -- yeah, they're -- they're gonna pay for their lawyers, and blah, blah, blah, but our tax dollars pays for the actual court trial, and, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] okay, so I -- I -- I guess they just, like, you know, whatever, they're gonna get off anyway, 'cause they're gonna hire some um, high powered attorney, or what not, and get off -- why then waste any more of our money, they're just like, "Let 'em go".
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I don't know. 
L:  It's sad that they do that though [LAUGH] -- our deficit is [LAUGH], so high right now that, like, they're trying to save all this money to go to this war, who they can't find, it's like -- who would be -- who they can't even find [several inaudible words] attack anyway, so, I'm just like [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah, but don't you think -- 
L:  -- we need help [LAUGH].
R:  -- don't you think the deficit would be so much less, if, like, these basketball players weren't getting these huge salaries, or, like, if they'd like, donate it to -- I mean, like because we're in huge deficit, why are we paying so much money for this entertainment, while we could be, like, putting it towards things that actually matter in the world, rather than things that are just entertaining for us -- like, to us.
L:  I, like -- I -- I so hear what you're saying, but the deficit is not even really based on the entertainment industry, it's like --
R:  No, I know, no, it's -- it's -- because our government spends more money than they make, obviously --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, it -- but, it's just -- I mean, if you think about all this extra money in the world that people are just getting richer in return don't need all this money, and aren't even giving it to charity, they're just blowing it on extravagant things, I think that it's so much more important to be, like, helping people and helping, like, their country, or like, helping, like, a charity, I don't know -- that's another thing I have with them having huge salaries, like, they get to, like, do whatever they want with it, and usually they don't know how -- like, they don't really give to charities, I mean, who -- like, a lot of stars do, but a lot of them don't, it just -- [MN] it -- like, all this money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- could be going toward something that's so much better than what it actually is going towards.
L:  It just seems that, like, the younger and younger are getting richer, but see, that's also bad, because -- like, they buy all of this stuff and come -- when it's time to pay taxes, granted, you know, they have a lot of money to burn, but because they buy this stuff they have to pay a lot of taxes in return, like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [MN] there was, ah, eight million dollar homes that sit on, what?  Three hundred acres, and the land taxes alone on that, could break anybody, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in order to pay that kind of money they have to upkeep the -- the lifestyle and jobs and stuff that they're in, you know?
R:  Yeah, I just watched this, um, this expose on, like, Jada and Will Smith, and, like, [MN] in nineteen ninety or something, Will Smith owed the IRS, like, a million dollars because he had spent all of this, like, savings that he had earned, and, I don't know, like, it's just like people are getting into so much, I don't know -- 
L:  It's just --
R:  -- I don't know what that has to do with anything, but [LAUGH] I saw it and it was interesting [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, it's ah -- it's expensive to -- to upkeep an image, but, like, the, um -- the deficit, like, they -- they make it seem like, you know, it's the people's fault, and -- and all that, but, really interfering -- like, well, the problem with America is that they interfere in a lot of, um, international business, and that costs money.  To send, ah, our politicians over there to -- to make negotiations and stuff that does not concern us, costs money.
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] -- but --
L:  To keep soldiers, [LAUGH] in, like, um, Iraq, or even, you know, maybe even Australia -- Australia, costs money, like, some of these people, granted they serve the country or what not, but, their, um, monthly, um -- their money allowances go as high as like, five thousand dollars a month.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, so [LAUGH], like, a lot of government paid city [several inaudible words] jobs -- they pay their people a lot ...
