L:  Hello?
R:  Hel- -- hi.  This is Candace.
L:  Hi.  This is Anita.
R:  Hey, Anita.  How you doing?
L:  Oh, I'm doing fine.  How are you doing?
R:  I'm fine thanks.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm calling from Seattle, Washington.  What about you?
R:  Los Angeles, California.
L:  Oh.  Yeah.
R:  And it's so funny that this is the question because I just brought my mom to the airport. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  Did they do a lotta screening with the --
R:  They didn't.  Not --
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, not when I was dropping her off but I picked her up on July third --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and there were, um -- there were checks.  You know, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- security checks.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, they just were waving everybody through.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  I was really --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- surprised.  It was like they had the roadblocks up with the cops there and everything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we'd just drive by and I mean, I drive a Grand Am so, you know, I have a trunk --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't have a hatchback.  They didn't check my trunk or anything.
L:  I thought they were, sorta, like to do random spot checks or something like that?
R:  There weren't any going on.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  They were checking, like, the vans and the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- big cars.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But what's to say, like, the small cars aren't carrying something.
L:  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  Or if somebody's just, like, a terrorist or something and they're watching what type of things they're checking.
R:  Right.
L:  And if they're just checking vans and big cars and they say, "Well, let's drive ..." you know, they could just scope it out and --
R:  E- -- I think they're going with the stereotypes too, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I mean, I'm Hispanic but I look like -- you know, I -- I'm Spanish.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  My family's Spanish but I look white.  You know?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I've got the white girl, brown hair --
L:  Right.
R:  -- brown eyes, whatever, and, um, I guess they wouldn't assume that a th- -- you know, somebody like me would go through, you know, and bomb the place or whatever.
L:  Mm.
R:  But I do a -- a heck of a lot of traveling.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when I went to Kansas City, um, couple of months ago, they were [LAUGH] like searching these old people.  And I mean, old like --
L:  Really?
R:  -- seventy five year old people.  Like --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Patting them down and stuff.
L:  Oh. [LIPSMACK]
R:  You know, and it's, like, okay, why in Kansas City, when -- where nothing has happened --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- would they do something like that?  And you've got somebody in California just driving in a -- in with a car.  They --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  They're not even bothering to pop your trunk.  You know what I mean?
L:  Mhm.  Or if you could see they just doing random then people would -- if they were going to do something --
R:  Right.
L:  -- terrorists, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they would say, "Well, hey, we don't know if they're gonna check our car or not.  We better not do it".  And all's they gotta do is just watch and say --
R:  Right.  But there wasn't -- they weren't even showing that.  Like, I work at the, um, movie studios here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and when you go in, you have to go through a gate.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And at the gate they ask you to pop your trunk.  It doesn't matter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who you are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what you look like, if you're famous, whatever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And you have to pop your trunk and they take mirrors and they look under your car with the mirrors.  Why don't they do that at --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's what they should do.
R:  Yeah.  Why don't they do that at the -- at the airports?
L:  I think they ther- -- they should have more screening.  Though, when that guy had the thing in his shoe, it was, sorta, weird on the news watching people taking off their shoes in the airport.
R:  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.
L:  And never see the day where y- -- people have to take off their shoes.
R:  Well, goi- -- like I said, I do a lot of traveling.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and this girl was in front of me -- we were going to New Zealand.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And this is, like, last month.  This girl was in front of me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she had high heeled sandals on.
L:  Mm.
R:  Okay?  Like, the little stiletto sandals.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they made her take 'em off.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, what were they -- they're -- they're trying to see if she had -- I mean, there's not that many places she could hide --
R:  You had to take -- no.  You take 'em off and you put 'em through the, ah --
L:  Oh, they thought something might be in it?  Um --
R:  They were stiletto heels.
L:  Yeah.  There's n- -- it's v- -- not very much you can get --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in stiletto heels.
R:  So --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  Do you do a lot of traveling?
L:  Ah, I haven't.  When I was younger -- I'm in my forties.  When I was younger we used to, um -- army brat travel a lot but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- now I haven't -- I'm just now, maybe, beginning to think about [LAUGH] traveling.  So -- but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I thought the security would be a lot better but it doesn't seem like it's --
R:  Yeah.  It really surprises me.
L:  -- too much more better.  Hm?
R:  Um, when I was in New Zealand -- and this is last month -- um, we were watching the news --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I don't know if it made the news up here but somebody on Qantas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- from a -- a -- a passenger -- as soon as they took off, I think it was out of Melbourne --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- jumped up and stabbed somebody in the neck --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- with, like, a toothpick.
L:  Oh, w- with a toothpick?
R:  Or -- or just some -- yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  Like, some wooden stick.  Like, one of those --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- long skewered toothpicks and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and attacked a flight attendant.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sheesh.  That's terrorist --
R:  So, it's happening everywhere.
L:  Huh. [SIGH]
R:  So, I don't think it -- I don't think it prevents it.
L:  No.  I don't think so either.
R:  You know?  I mean, I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I [COUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  Excuse me.  I think it might --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- deter it a little bit.
L:  You get what?
R:  I think it might deter it a little bit.
L:  Yeah.  It might deter it a little bit but not that much.
R:  I don't think so.
L:  I don't think.  Yeah.
R:  Mm mm.  I mean, I'm from New York too.
L:  Oh, you're from New York?  Yeah.
R:  Originally from New York.  My whole --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- family's there.  So, it was, like -- hm.  You know, what [LAUGH] -- what -- ho- how are they gonna prevent it ha- -- from happening again?  My mom was, kinda, hesitant to get on the plane.  She doesn't wanna fly from here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  She's flying into JFK.
L:  Oh.  So, she's flying from the West Coast all the way to the East Coast?
R:  Yeah.  LAX to JFK.
L:  See, that would make me nervous 'cause when they -- those planes in nine eleven, they were coming --
R:  From --
L:  And they were on a long flight --
R:  Right.
L:  -- from New York way to the west.
R:  Right.
L:  And I guess they picked it 'cause they had so much gas -- more gas.
R:  A- -- that's exactly right.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  So, I mean, I don't -- personally, I don't think that it's a, ah -- i- it -- huh -- it i- really prevents.  That was the question, right?
L:  Yeah.  W- what d- do you think that it's -- is -- it -- security checks are preventing more terrorist --
R:  I don't think anything with security checks.  I don't think it could prevent -- I don't think anything can prevent terrorism.
L:  No.  I don't think so.  But if they can do it more better I think it might help to deter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or catch some, um, plans or plots and don't allow them to go up.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But I think they'd -- but I think they're still gonna try.  You know, they're --
R:  Oh, I think so too.
L:  They're not gonna -- yeah.
R:  I think so too and -- and I mean, now a- -- [COUGH] I think making the planes safer and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think that's more important.
L:  Yeah.  I think so too.  'Cause it's just -- it's -- some people are nervous about flying anyway --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and then you gotta worry --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- about this and --
R:  I just got off the phone with my grandma and -- and I was, like, "Grandma, I'd really like you to come to visit".  She's, like, "There is no way --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- I am getting on a plane".
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  So, I was, like, "Okay".
L:  Jeeze.
R:  Bummer.
L:  My goodness.
R:  Um --
L:  Where does your grandmother live?
R:  New York.
L:  New York?
R:  Everybody -- I'm the only one out --
L:  Oh, to come all the way to the West Coast?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm the only one out here and she's just, like, "No, way.  Thanks anyway.  Not doing it".
L:  Well, maybe they're getting more people on Amtrak, the trains.  But then they can do something on the trains too.
R:  Ye- -- oh, my gosh, they totally could.  A pl- -- a tr- -- a train here just wiped out an entire neighborhood.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.  There was --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- an accident and it wiped out an entire neighborhood and -- and I think it was Camarillo or -- or Northridge --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or something like that.  Wiped the --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- entire thing out.
L:  Did people get hurt and everything or ...?
R:  I don't know if anybody got hurt.  I just know it, like, wiped out the, ah -- the houses 'cause it was lumber train.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, people can totally get any kind of, ah -- do anything with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Depending on, you know, where they get -- I don't even know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what I'm trying to say, [LAUGH] but, like, they can get onto a plane and -- and do something to destroy it --
L:  Right.
R:  Excuse me.  I mean, they could get onto a -- a train, they could do anything.  And I mean, I went into a bathroom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a little girl left her suitcase there.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so good little girl -- we were -- you know, she was ready to go into the bathroom and I said, "Honey, is that yours?"  And the mother flipped out.  She's, like, "Oh, my god, they're gonna think that it's some, sort of, bomb.  Go get that".
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.  Yeah.
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  But she's true.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, sh- -- it's true.
L:  Unattended.
R:  It's totally true.
L:  Any unattended luggage.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yep.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So --
L:  Oh, just scary.
R:  I know.
L:  I wonder what they think ab- -- what they're gonna do about -- what do they do to deter, like, people who just ship stuff through the plane?  You know, they're not with the -- you know, like freight and stuff like that.  I mean, do they really check that or ...?  Or they probably have to just --
R:  I -- huh.  I have no idea.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just know it's a pain in the butt --
L:  You -- it makes it longer --
R:  -- to, um --
L:  -- lines and everything.
R:  Yeah.  To the sh- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, because you have to -- you don't ship it through the airport.  Like, we never see where the packages go.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But you never know who's shipping what.  Like --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- you have to go through UPS, you have to go through FedEx and -- or the post office.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  So, it's, like, you know, a- --
L:  Mm.
R:  Nobody knows who's -- who's selling wh- -- or who's sending what.
L:  And those --
R:  So --
L:  -- are put on commercial airlines too, aren't they?
R:  And you have to detail what it is.  Yeah.  I -- I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- don't know if they're put on commercial airlines.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I sure hope that they check [LAUGH] everything. [LAUGH]
L:  I hope so too.  Gosh.
R:  X-ray it or whatever.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well, what about the pilots?  Can they carry guns now or something?  I remember they were goi- --
R:  Can't they -- I think they can.
L:  Oh, they can?  Oh, good.
R:  I think they can.
L:  Yeah.  Hm.
R:  So, I -- yeah.  I -- but the thing that bothers me is that people actually got into our -- the -- the terrorists got into our flight school.
L:  R- right.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what's saying that a pilot on there isn't gonna be somebody from Al Qaeda or whatever?
L:  Right.  Or who's b- been here --
R:  So, how are you -- right.  I mean, ha- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  They can lie to get through it or -- or whatever.
L:  Or how many have already graduated?
R:  Right.
L:  How many sleeper cells --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they have around here, you know?  They probably still got a lot off spin[?], you know, around the country and just waited for -- waiting for somebody to tell them to become active, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Right.  You never know what happens.
L:  Yeah.  It's scary.
R:  [SIGH] It's just -- yeah.  It is scary.  Especially with all this -- I mean, this year alone I went to New York, I came back here, I went to New Zealand, came back here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Next month I'm going to Canada.  You know, I -- it just [SIGH] -- hopefully -- I don't know.  We'll see what happens.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I don't know.  So, you travel a lot on airplanes?  So, what do they do?  They just have you walk through the metal detector and have your bags go through the x-ray thing?
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Do -- do they have the -- is that just the same as they've had before or have they done anything extra?
R:  Basically, yeah, and if you set it off they have to take you aside and then the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, women have to check the women.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, and men have to check --
