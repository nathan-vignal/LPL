R:  Am I talking to someone? [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, hi.  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  Uh, yeah, I -- I'm sorry, what -- what was the topic, again, I missed the topic.
R:  Yes.
L:  What's the topic for today?
R:  Oh, what is the topic?  Um, whether or not the US should be involved in the -- in the peace talks in the Middle East, and whether or not peace would be possible in the Middle East, I believe.
R:  Oh, okay, okay.  So, what -- what do you feel about that?
R:  Um, I feel, like, well, the US is one of the biggest, um, causes of the war in the Middle East to begin with, so, I definitely think the US should be a part of the whole thing.  I believe that's what's going on right now, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, I'm not really well read about the issue, but, um, I anything, I feel like the US should be involved.
L:  Yeah, even I am not well read about the issue --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Even I am not well read about the issues, but -- --
R:  I'm not, I haven't been reading very much I haven't been keeping up with it, um, I just do know that there are still troops over there, overseas, and there's still a lot of uprisings that are going on, a lot of soldiers are being killed, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- even after the war has officially, like, ended, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I'm not really sure if there's talk's that are being held, and if they're -- if they've found anything -- I believe the US is still looking for, um, the weapons that they, you know, suspected that were being held in Iraq.
L:  Oh, --
R:  Are we talking about the war in Iraq, or just issues in the Middle East in general?
L:  I'm sorry, what was that?
R:  Are you talking about the war in Iraq in particular, or the Middle East, Middle Eastern issues in general?
L:  I don't know, I mean, I was talking mainly towards the war in Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, now, US should be involved since, you know, since --
R:  That --
L:  -- a lot of money in -- I mean, removing Saddam Hussein from his regime, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, probably, I mean, they should be involved, but, you know, only at the monitoring level, not going it deep inside the politics of Iraq, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, have someone to -- have only one or two bodies to control Iraq.  But at the same time, give the entire power to the persons -- to the people in Iraq.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, it is -- what -- what -- why the US attacked Iraq, it should be accomplished.  I mean, if another person comes who's like Saddam Hussein, I mean, it's not good news, right?
R:  Say this again?
L:  I mean, it another person who -- who's like Saddam Hussein, who's as cruel as Saddam Hussein, if he comes to regime, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, US -- US, I think US will have to fight another war again.
R:  Do you think the US is going to fight another war, --
L:  No, no, -- if -- if a person like Saddam Hussein comes -- comes as a power in Iraq again, --
R:  Oh, --
L:  Then they --
R:  -- would the -- would the US, um, go to war again?
L:  I don't know.
R:  I think -- I think that, um, well, I don't feel like the issues are completely resolved, currently, and we have to finish this, like, you know, make sure everything is good --
L:  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
R:  -- it's going, you know, going to come to terms and everything is going to be all right, before we can think about anything else, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and I think it definitely is a possibility if Saddam Hussein is, like, not alive or is alive, I feel like there's going to be, um, definitely will be a chance for someone like Saddam Hussein that'll, you know, take the power of the -- kind of, like, the power, [several inaudible words], like, you know, --
L:  Mhm, mhm, yeah.
R:  -- it's the US kind of leaves -- leaves the area, I feel like, it definitely will be a possibility, um, that someone else will rise to power, and similar situation will become a problem again.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- in which case, it really depends on the presidency, and whether or not the US feels that it should get involved, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, if Bush is reelected, I feel, like, he would broadly want to finish what he started, in a sense, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, there will definitely be US and Iraqi, like, relationships, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- whether or not they be good or bad, is to be determined, but, um, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I feel like the US will keep on being involved the issues, because he's not just, like, going to go in and leave, um, the area, if that makes any sense.
L:  Yeah, I -- I think US will be involved, I mean, [inaudible] --
R:  It'll -- it'll be really wary, because, um, I don't know if the people or the public is really -- I mean, there are a lot of, um, I don't feel like it was really supported by any other countries, and right now, they're having problems trying to, like, defend their cause, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the US went in there kind of saying that there are these weapons of mass destruction, and there are all these weapons there, and they haven't found anything yet, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and whether or not they do, I feel like, um, if they do, then maybe they'll have a reason for, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- going into the -- starting the war, and killing all these people, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the people who are behind the US supporting the war will be like, "Okay, you know, they had a reason to go in, because their, you know, their hunch was correct", you know and they, you know, Iraq was actually a threat, perhaps, you know, to the world, --
L:  Well, exactly.
R:  -- world balance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, and then, -- but if you go then, and whole thing, after, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- six months, after the war is ended, then, if Saddam Hussein or someone like Saddam Hussein comes to power again, I don't feel, like, the US will have the same kind of support from all the other countries, because they made the first -- you know, the they made a mistake take the first time, um, --
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  -- why would the people --
L:  Risk ano- another war
R:  You know, rally behind Bush, or whoever the president of the time for the US to go in again, you know, 'cause --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they didn't have a point to go in the first time.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, I don't know, the question is simple, I mean, I think the US will -- will take some initiative and go into -- I mean, take some initiative in the politics of Iraq, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because the main reason -- I mean, most the weapons of mass destruction [inaudible] and second is the gas, I think, I mean, if US controls some part of Iraq, they could have some profit over the gas transaction, you know, I mean, your --
R:  What transactions?
L:  -- US will get gas at a cheaper rate from Iraq than what it is getting now.
R:  Oh, so, you're saying --
L:  That was -- that was a main reason, you know, gas prices have fallen down since -- since the beginning of war.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean --
R:  -- and that's because -- I'm sorry, I've not listened while you've -- that's because the gas prices are falling down because why?
L:  Because US -- US has started to get gas from Iraq at a lower price now.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's the main reason, I mean, Iraq is very well [inaudible] in gasoline -- gasoline.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well --
R:  Oh, r- r- right, um, so, you're -- you're saying that that's the reason why the US got involved in the first place, was for the oil?
L:  Yeah, exactly. I --
R:  But, yeah, I definitely feel like that's part of the reason as well, um, I mean, the economy and politics and all that kind of stuff, is kind of really closely linked together, and so, like, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, the US, is, I don't even how many percentage of -- gas prices affect, like, everything, and -- in the US, you can use it for, like, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- travelling, you can use it for electricity, and so on, and so forth, --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- so I feel like that is a big -- that is a big reason why the US got involved, um.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And also other ties between the -- like, unfinished ties between, um, Iraq and the US, and you know, since Daddy Bush was in -- in office.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] --
R:  Since the Gulf War.
L:  Yeah, um, okay, I mean, -- how well are you conversant with all these things, all these politics, in Iraq, I mean, have you been reading regularly, or -- during the war?
R:  Um, I -- not really.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I read on it -- I've been reading a little bit more these past -- these past couple of weeks, more so than when the war started, but, um, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- after wh- -- I kept up well with it towards the beginning, and probably towards the end, but in the middle, it was kind of lost in between.
L:  Mhm, oh, same thing with me, I mean, when the war started, I kept -- I was totally updated on what things are going on, --
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  -- but then -- but as my exams, so I could not concentrate more than -- I could not concentrate there --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, so, [LAUGH] you know, I'm suddenly, now -- I mean, I've totally lost the track right now.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  -- so, now the exams are over and I can --
R:  You can kind of keep up with it, yeah, I agree
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Definitely.
L:  It's, uh, --
R:  Definitely.
L:  Uh, so, how did you come to know of all of this, uh, this survey going on, I mean, the --
R:  I'm not really sure, actually it -- um, -- I think we found it over the internet or something, --
L:  Oh, --
R:  -- yeah, how about yourself?
L:  I mean, I got an email through my friend, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which he gave to me, and --
R:  Oh, --
L:  But that's the only reason -- it's easy money basically, to talk for ten minutes you get ten bucks.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, it's not a bad deal, it's not a bad deal.
L:  Yeah, that's why.
R:  So, -- yeah, same here.  Getting some money for the summer, I suppose.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, where are you from?
R:  I am from -- well, right now, I'm in Philadelphia.
L:  Oh, Philadelphia, well, --
R:  Yeah, so I'm in Philly --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I'm originally from Texas.
L:  Oh, where in Texas?
R:  [inaudible] right outside Dallas.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm in Tucson right now.
R:  You're in Tucson?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah
