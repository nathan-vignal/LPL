R:  [inaudible]
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello?
L:  This is Jamie.
R:  Hey.
L:  Hi.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Um, I didn't get the topic quite well did you hear it?
R:  Um, about Middle East conflict and if, um, peace will be achieved.
L:  What -- conflict of what?
R:  In the Middle East.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  If like peace will be achieved.
L:  Okay.  You can go first.
R:  Um, I don't think it will ever happen.  [LAUGH]
L:  You don't think it will ever happen?
R:  No.
L:  Why is that?
R:  Cause they just hate each other and I mean like one won't give in to the other and you know [inaudible] like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We're supporting one side way too much and the other's just you know just trying to hold their own, I just don't think peace will ever happen.
L:  Okay.  So do you think it's even harder because we're involved in it or like should we just let it happen?  I don't know are you -- are you for you know the States to get involved in those things?
R:  Not really -- well I mean -- I mean I personally think if we weren't helping Israel I think they'd we wiped out like straight up.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I mean as far as I'm concerned it's a joke -- we should -- I mean if we are going to intervene which we kind of are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we should go in and say, "Hey this is how we are going to divide the land up" and boom it would be done, no more fighting or [inaudible] but I don't think America should [inaudible] to do it so that probably won't happen.  And the other thing is you know, just pull out and let them settle [inaudible] but I guess if they pull out Israel's screwed cause like they're just getting wiped out.  So that's the way I see it but there is no way you can have peace.
L:  Mhm.
R:  What about you?
L:  Um, I don't think it's impossible but it will take a lot longer and it will definitely take more than what you know just the States doing right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cause they're kind of forcing it to happen and it can't happen that way because they have to naturally come to a compromise naturally.
R:  Right.
L:  At times so yeah I don't think it can happen in this way but in the future maybe you know.
R:  Yeah well that's the thing like neither side want to compromise.
L:  Right.
R:  That's the thing you really can't put -- there's just so much fighting like if this happened like over the past year or so fine but its just decades.
L:  It's -- yeah it's tough, it has so much history.
R:  There's so much hostility, so it can't really happen it's not like you know because, "Oh, you stole [inaudible] land" and land you know I guess --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- people need it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I personally think they're wasting their -- wasting time over there.
R:  Oh, completely yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And their foreign policy is just horrible so that's --
L:  [NOISE] Are you a democrat?
R:  Um, I don't believe in either party but, um, I guess closer to d- -- to democrats than anything else but I think they're just both corrupt.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah I mean -- yeah.
R:  But I guess --
L:  Of course but --
R:  But I guess if I had to go with one I would go usually with the democrats.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] great views, which I haven't seen over the last twenty years.
L:  Yeah true -- that's true.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from Maryland.
R:  Oh, Maryland, okay.
L:  Yeah -- mhm -- so, um, yeah I'm leaning towards democrat also.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Because it's just, um, I'm one of those people who still don't like Bush.
R:  Dude he's a moron I can't believe [inaudible]
L:  [LAUGH] Are you surprised how much -- like how many people like him now after the war.
R:  Of course -- I read the statistics was twenty percent of the people think they found all of these weapons supposedly.  We never found jack shit I mean when twenty percent are easily manipulated, I mean, how can you, you know [inaudible] voting for him.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right -- right but you know even in college you know you would think all of the college students would be you know against Bush but he has actually gained a lot of um --
R:  All of these college students like I'm still in school, this is my fourth year and like I just look around me and all of these kids are like total [inaudible] like they don't even --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- know what's going on.  They go to their bar Friday night and like it's [inaudible] and like if you ask them about anything thing the Mideast or anything that is going on, it's just like whatever.  The media you know tell them they just regurgitate it back and they don't even know the research about so.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right -- right.
R:  I am not even surprised.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know what's really depressing though even if you do the research, like I'm trying to read an article at least like you now once a day.
R:  Right.
L:  Related to, um, Middle East and what's happening over there but like --
R:  Of course you want to know what's happening.
L:  But even -- yeah even so like I'm not with the press because you can't really find kind of what actually happened.
R:  No -- it's totally biased like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] So you've got to really like filter through and see what [inaudible] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because you have to like look into it because you have to differentiate on what is it that they are trying to sell you and what's actually fact -- you know if they tell you know twenty people got bombed --
L:  Uh-huh -- right.
R:  [inaudible] well you have got to think well is it true like I didn't make it up like so it's wrong.
L:  Yeah it's wrong.  So [LAUGH] I don't know if it's a good idea to read the articles cause you know there's more chance that I'll be biased along with the articles.
R:  Well [inaudible] you know what happened but then obviously it's hard because you have to find like incredible sources you just have to keep -- I guess verifying with other sources that are reporting the same thing and see what is deal is.
L:  Exactly.  Yep.  Yeah I didn't hear the topic at all today I was like what [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- because my mum brought me the phone and they you know they tell you that the topic, um, [inaudible] and then they give you time to choose.
R:  Right.
L:  So [NOISE]
R:  But yeah I just -- it's not going to happen it's just I don't think it's ever going to happen like that -- I mean just kind of generally like peace is -- people are just arrogant and greedy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like peace really can't happen -- mean yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well maybe in a couple of generations -- maybe.
R:  It's just going to get even worst like I said you can't force it like and that's exactly what they're trying to do, so when you have money invested in you know just foreign policy dictating things you can't really force peace that way.  I guess the only way you can do it is you pull out and let them handle it themselves --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because one way or another someone is going to give in and you will have peace some way that way.
L:  So you --
R:  -- or you just force it and say, "Here you divide the land this way" but that's bullying and you can't really do that -- you know.
L:  So you think they're going to grow farther and farther?
R:  Oh, completely.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Look at all of these things you hear, "Oh, they're going to sign a peace" [inaudible] it's bull shit who like -- no way.  Like even if it's like Israeli's, Palestintian's one or the other like they're both good and evil like balanced -- like I don't consider Israel like to be [inaudible] they're both equally bad and good --
L:  Right.
R:  -- in their own way so when I hear, "Oh, the bad Palestinian's or these heroic Israeli's" that's bull shit they're all exactly the same like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's totally [inaudible] they are both on the same wavelength.
L:  They're both exactly the same way I guess -- well I don't know because I don't come from you know that area at all so --
R:  No me neither yeah -- but I mean I see it on the news you look at them side by side they look exactly the same and like they're both in the same region, they're not that different -- I just -- like I said either you pull out or let them handle themselves or you dictate it and either way it is not really viable.
L:  Right.
R:  So that's why you can't have peace.
L:  What about the economy role -- I mean like if from now on they're -- all of the countries are going to grow like closer and closer to each other and they have to interconnect you know in some way.
R:  Um, --
L:  You don't think that's -- that has luck at all?
R:  No not really.
L:  No -- not at all?
R:  No because I mean like Palestine you know they have all of the Arab nations everyone behind them.
L:  Right.
R:  So they're doing everything with them and we're pretty much funding Israel.  [LAUGH]  So they don't you know need anyone else -- so no.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't think that's really a big deal.  [LAUGH]
L:  I see [LAUGH] okay.  [COUGH] You seem to believe in very, very strongly --
R:  The what?
L:  You seem to believe in it very very strongly that it can't ever happen.
R:  No because I see what's going around, it's just like all of these false -- I guess hopes and just like all of the crap and -- I mean it has been going on for years like I don't even know like how many years exactly it's been a long time.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah -- it's been a long time -- I don't know.
R:  Yeah so I mean it's just -- there's certain things that go on like behind the scenes like it's just bull shit.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  What are you studying in school?
L:  Oh, I study, um, finance.
R:  Okay.
L:  Yeah in business major.
R:  Yep.
L:  What do you study?
R:  Marketing.
L:  Oh, you're in marketing.  I -- I was in marketing major but, um, I don't know where do you go to school?
R:  I go to, uh, [inaudible] it's in Manhattan.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Yep.
L:  Yeah I like marketing too but I just -- everybody was telling me I was wasting my time in money -- learning marketing because it's not really something that can be learned or taught.
R:  Um, yes and no -- you can like -- there's certain aspects of marketing because like there's not just advertising like there's different research and
