R:  Hi, this is Anne.
L:  Hi, this is Aaron[?].
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Okay.  So what do you think with regard to the airport security?
L:  Um, it seems like it makes a little bit of a difference but I don't really know that it makes that big of a difference 'cause tons -- you still -- you still hear stories about all this stuff that gets through, you know, so tons of things slip by.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, like things slip by but I think what's important is [SIGH] you know, to be more proactive with regard to getting the crazies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, possibly screened out.  Where are you in the country?
L:  Florida.
R:  Okay, I'm in New York City.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, and I don't know where in Florida you are, um, you know, here, we have a very, very large varied, you know, ah, various ethnic communities.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I know, and I'm just talking for me, okay, that a month before nine eleven, um, I had taken a seminar and I met a very nice woman who was a stereotypical blue eyed blond cheer leader.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she was married to an Egyptian and this was a month before nine eleven.  Ah, we go out to lunch and, you know, she's complaining about her marriage, how her husband's so chauvinistic and blah, blah, blah and very, very ant- -- anti American.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, in fact, you know, although he had some fancy job at Citibank, um, you know, he was always making, you know, anti American statements.  And I guess maybe because I'm around it a lot more, um, more sensitive to it and so that's why the more security the better.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you're not doing anything wrong, then you don't have anything to worry about.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  You know, and okay, so fine if they want to take your knitting needles, if they want to take your nail clippers, you know, it's a pain in the ass, let 'em have it.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  But, you know, the problem is, ah, quite frankly these mother fuckers are crazy.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know, in plain English, and so, you know, um, we have to do what we have to do in order to protect ourselves.  Can I ask how old you are?
L:  I'm twenty two.
R:  Oh, okay, see, I'm a bit older and I've travelled extensively throughout Europe and in years past, um, what was so interesting is when you went to other European countries, there -- they already had all of this heightened security in place.
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.  The strangest thing when I was flying out of Rome is that, you know, someone came up to me and said, "Did you pack your own bags?"
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, because they were used to having all of -- all of this.  So, you know, the rest of the world is used to this.  We're not.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Okay.  So, I'm sorry, I'm doing all the talking.  You talk.
L:  I just -- I definitely I think it makes, you know, in that sense, the fact that it's like random checking.  It's -- it's good but it's just -- but it also cracks me up when people say that like you k- -- we need this but yet they get -- they get pissed off when they're the ones that get stopped and get searched.  Like my -- my, um, father in law was in the -- the navy for most of his life.  Then one time we were flying, we -- we came up, you know, on our ticket.  I don't know how they know who to search but I've heard it's random selection.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And we got searched and you just getting all mad and I was just laughing inside at -- at him 'cause, I mean, they can't just, you know, who -- for all they know, you know, yeah, we look like whatever -- whatever the average American means, I guess we kind of look like that.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, like we look like a family you might see on TV or something but we should still, you know, get checked just like anybody else.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is funny 'cause he was getting mad.
R:  Right.  Now and I understand totally and, I mean, you know, like forgive me again being in New York, okay, most of the cab drivers are Middle Eastern.  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so it's like, you know, I mean, it wasn't blue eyed blonds who, you know, brought down the World Trade, okay.
L:  Mm.
R:  We know exactly who they were.  They were Saudis and we know what they look like.  It's very distinct, and, you know, unfortunately forgive me the bleeding heart liberals, you know, had to make it so certain people are inconvenienced.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Um, and that's a pity 'cause we know it isn't someone from Iowa trying to do this, okay.
L:  Yeah, just I don't see -- I don't know, I don't think we co- -- you can -- it's that easy to just suggest because these people happen to be from a certain country, to therefore single out everyone who lives here from that country.  I mean -- I mean, that's what our country has done all along, but I -- I don't really agree with it.  I mean, during World War Two we put all the Japanese people in internment camps even if they'd lived here for two generations and all this stuff like that, but I don't really think it's the best way of handling the situation.
R:  Well, it may not be the best way of handling it but how else are you going to do it?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, I mean, you know, what I thought was horrifically scary was that after nine eleven, you know, they started figuring out how many people were here on expired visas, how many people were here on expired visas and they couldn't find them.
L:  Mm.
R:  Okay, and, you know, again, I mean, I don't know where in Florida you are, are you in the metropolitan area?
L:  I'm in Gainesville, it's in north central Florida.
R:  Okay.  You know, again, I'm in Manhattan and, you know, one thing I find extremely offensive, and regardless of which immigrant community it is, you know, it could be Chinese, Polish, Middle Eastern, but the prevailing thought throughout the world is that basically they have a right to come here.  Okay, and it doesn't matter what we think and it doesn't matter if we want them, okay.  You know, it's that, you know, um, they're all claiming, you know, political asylum and it's like, look, you know, there comes a point where, hey, I was born in a place, I don't like what's going on, I have to step up to the plate and do something about it, okay.  I can't go running to the United States, you know, and demanding that they take me in because I have the right.  No, okay.
L:  I mean, I don't know, part of the rea- --
R:  And that's what they forget.
L:  I don't think -- I think -- I don't know, part of the reason that most of those people come here is because, whether directly or indirectly, our foreign policy has totally screwed over any chance of them having a stable economy or stable political situation.  So, I mean, like all throughout central America and southern America like the CIA in the fifties and sixties and seventies went in and fucked everything up so people -- people have nothing there to even start with so they come here because it's -- it's for some people it's an option.  I mean, I don't feel like I can hold that against them.  My -- my, you know, my great-grandfather did the same thing.  He came over here from Eastern Europe because everything was just fucked and unstable, and he came here.  So, I mean, it's -- he did that so I don't feel like I can say that people who live in central or southern America or Asia, they -- they should have that chance.  I don't -- I don't know, I don't think it's right for us to just close everything off and forget what happened to our own people in the past.
R:  Well, I mean, what happens is that when, um, there was immigration back in the eighteen hundreds and, you know, before that and even in the early part of the century --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, they followed the rules, okay.  When you were coming through Ellis Island, you know, there were no wetbacks, okay.  And, you know, at some point in time, each individual is responsible for their own actions and, you know, okay, so you claim that, you know, in the -- was it sixties, seventies and eighties, did you say?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay, well, you know, welcome to two thousand and three, okay.  At some point, and even with their own country, I mean, there's a lot of stuff that's going on, okay, and, you know, with regard to airport security, some people are pro, some people are con.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay, whatever stand you take, okay, you have to be proactive and do something to change it if you disagree with it, okay.  And that's what's not going on.  Okay, the reason these people are coming is economics.
L:  Yeah, every -- every time they try to make a change, just because it might not be a hundred per cent what our government wants it to be, we -- we send troops in or we fund troops in to overthrow everything and destabilize it.  I mean, when -- even when people try to make changes they get screwed over by us either directly or indirectly.  So I -- I don't -- I still don't feel like I can say that they're not trying to do anything.
