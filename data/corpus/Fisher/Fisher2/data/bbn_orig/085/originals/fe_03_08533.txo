L:  Ash.
R:  Hi, this is Sarah. [LAUGH]
L:  Hey.
R:  Hi. [LAUGH] Uh, I'm not sure I understood what the -- what the topic was.
L:  Pardon?
R:  Um, uh, what -- what was the topic we were supposed to be discussing?
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Did you understand?
L:  Um, if heightened airport security's going to be -- is going to make a difference. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] Um, I -- I thought that's what it was but I -- I missed the first word or two. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um -- 
L:  Um, I really don't think it's going to make a difference.
R:  Uh --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- I don't think so either. [LAUGH]
L:  -- to a slight degree but, you know, like I live in New York and, like, you know, soldiers with AK47s in the subways isn't going to help, you know, if there's like a gas attack or something so I don't see why, you know, more security's going to -- I mean, unless you search everyone which you can't.  Um, I mean, it's slightly going to help but, you know, if [LAUGH] somebody wanted to do something they're going to find a way to do it.
R:  Well, that -- that's what I figure.  If, um -- if somebody really wants to, uh, launch a terrorist attack it's not going matter whether we have, um, increased security standing by the -- the little X ray machines as you go through at the airport. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Um, I -- I figure it -- it usually picks up, what, just metal, uh, a lot of times, it just detects metal.
L:  Right.
R:  I'm sure there are other ways that things can be brought through --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where it wouldn't be picked up.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, well, you know, so if airports don't work now, they'll just find something else. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Next time it'll be trains, I don't know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  Don't say that, I take the train. [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, you know, ha- -- have you had -- ever had to fly since all these new heightened security things have gone into effect?
L:  Um, yeah, I flew in November to Belgium actually and, I mean, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause they did like the random checks, whatever, like the person after me had to have that random check, I guess, which -- I mean, that's not really so much more heightened but, you know, they had extra soldiers and pretty much -- on the way back, at least --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I was kinda dirty 'cause I hadn't showered in three days 'cause we went to a festival and, like, we were all looking scraggy so they all searched us but other than that, like, you know, if these other guys took over the planes with -- what was it, like -- like two inch blades, I mean, I guess it doesn't take much to take over a plane so --
R:  Exactly [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't think it's going to make a big difference. [LAUGH]
R:  I haven't flown but I've taken my, uh -- my son to fly across the country.  I'm in Maryland so he flew out of Baltimore going to Seattle to see his dad --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, uh [LAUGH] the security was insane, [LAUGH] it really was.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Um, yeah, the -- the person in front of us, uh, was going through and it -- it honestly picks up everything, it seems like.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, the -- the poor woman had a, uh -- a little like butter knife thing in a picnic basket --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- that was -- well, it was in a plastic case in the picnic basket --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and it was -- well, that -- that -- that's all it was, just a little, you know, butter knife for spreading her peanut butter or [LAUGH] something for, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  For a picnic lunch [LAUGH] and, yeah, they -- they pulled her aside and confiscated her little butter knife and that was it. [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  And --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- also with the security [LAUGH], my -- our whole family couldn't take him to the plane.  I -- only one of us could go --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- so my husband couldn't walk along with him also.
L:  Really?
R:  There was just me, yeah.
L:  Wow, that sucks. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you have to get this little form filled out saying that it's okay for you to pass through security even though you're not taking the flight and, oh, it -- it's insane.
L:  Yeah, I mean, it is but, I mean, ultimately, like, it's just based on appearance, I guess, and, like, you know, I guess they'll be looking for Muslims or Arabs and it's ridiculous, like, that's stupid.  Like, if you really want to do something you'd think you'd just get someone, like, who fits [inaudible] the description, like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- not all [LAUGH] -- like, you could just hire some guy just to do something, I mean --
R:  Oh and I'm sure there are people would just, you know [MN] --
L:  Yeah, exactly, so I think it's just ridiculous, like, they should be, you know, figuring -- like, spending more time on their foreign af- -- like, foreign policy and, like, stop pissing off other people.  I mean, that's what the problem is. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.
L:  Like democracy --
R:  They're all pissed at us. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, like, these guys couldn't care if America's a democracy or not.
R:  Yeah, they --
L:  It's just our foreign policy sucks. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I know what you mean. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And -- well, it used to be rather than, you know, just giving somebody a call and chit chatting with them on the phone, the -- the president would, like, go to the other country and, you know, they'd all have the, you know -- their big talks or whatever --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, for days and days and ... well, now they just, you know, hop a flight, say hello maybe but that's about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  For the most part they just talk on the phone or send an email, [LAUGH] I think.
L:  Yeah.  Well, the thing is that our president I don't think he can really speak too well, like he's kind of a moron so [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.
L:  -- I don't think [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's by choice. [LAUGH] So, yeah --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Um, have you done this before --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- or this is the first call?
R:  Uh, I've done two others. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, two others, okay, yeah.  First one.
R:  Oh, this is the first one you've done so far? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I just got a call.
R:  Oh, well that's cool. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It -- it's kinda neat, kind of a neat study, I think.
L:  Yeah.  So what, they just record this and, I guess --
R:  Yeah, and -- and I guess they just, uh, go over it and see how well people talk about a subject they just heard about and -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And talking to someone they don't know.
L:  I see, all right.
R:  So, you said you're in New York?
L:  Yeah, I live in New York City.
R:  Uh, so which, uh, airport were you flying in and out of at --
L:  Uh, [MN] what was it?  I think it was, uh, La Guardia.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I believe, I think it was --
R:  I've flown in there once and, of course, that was before all the --
L:  Yeah --
R:  All the attacks.
L:  -- all the -- after the stuff, yeah.
R:  There was no big deal then. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  But I know BWI here is just insane as far as --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, just even trying to get through at all.
L:  Wow, yeah.
R:  You can't go anywhere, you can't look at people funny, [LAUGH] they -- they don't let you drive up to the front and drop people off so much.  You know, you can only be there for a second if you do and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, the -- I think the security's becoming more of a hassle than anything.
L:  Yeah, I mean, like -- I mean, I understand security but, like, the way they're going about it, like, it's just ridiculous, like, uh, they're just basing it on profiling.  Like, you can't really do it that way.
R:  I -- I've seen something online where they're -- they're working on this new thing where they can -- they -- they scan people walking through, uh, but they --
L:  Hello?
R:  Oh, sorry about that. [LAUGH]
L:  That's all right.
R:  They -- they can completely scan you while -- while you're walking through so it -- it's almost like a little --
L:  Scan you what, like with an X ray or --
R:  Yeah, yeah, they -- it's something that -- that they were working on and --
L:  I don't know about that --
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, they'll have people coming down with, like, sicknesses, like X rays on, you know, once a while if you're sick, I guess, with a broken leg but you can't just, you know, get X rayed if you're taking a flight every other week. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] I was wondering how that would work out for people who are supposed to, uh, completely avoid X rays.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know, like pregnant women [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- who are not supposed to be X rayed at all.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Too many science fiction movies. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Although the --
L:  I mean, it's a great idea but, like, it's not practical, I mean, it's not healthy. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, and that and I think it's kind of an invasion of privacy.  I can't imagine walking through and, you know, the guy standing there and looking. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, seeing [inaudible]. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly. [LAUGH] That would be awful --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it'd be terrible, you know, especially if you got children walking through there.  So great, now they're looking at your kids.
L:  Yeah, of course.
R:  You know, I couldn't care less about me but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  -- you never know what kind of creep is standing there watching you as you go through.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN]
R:  I think it -- it's becoming more of an inconvenience than -- than anything.  I don't think I really felt any safer --
L:  Not at all, I mean, like --
R:  -- with having him get on the flight.
L:  -- especially, like, what was it a few months ago when there was, like, the level's up to code orange or whatever the color spectrum, system, whatever they have is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- which is ridiculous in the first place.  I mean, you had, like, all these people running out and, like, getting saran wrap and tape, I mean, give me a break --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- like that stuff's really going to sec- -- like, all these billions are spent and, like, that's the security we have.
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  Like what kind of -- it's so ridiculous and, like, morons, like politicians, like, oh, this is going to drive the economy when people are buying all these saran wraps and tapes.  I mean, come on.
R:  I thought that was crazy.  So you tape up your house?  Well, you'd have to stay in, you could never go back out --
L:  Right, so for about --
R:  -- 'cause once you go out you let it in. [LAUGH]
L:  Right, so for about two days you'll be safe and then by the time you need air and food then you can go out and die so ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, or -- or you have to go to work. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly, so --
R:  Or when it's already happened by the time you put the stuff up, you know, it's a little too late by then.
L:  Yeah, I mean [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's -- [LAUGH]
R:  Sit there and wait for it to happen.  I think it just scares people really. [LAUGH]
L:  Of -- like, this whole thing is just really about scaring, like, specially with, like, going in there, they never found anything and just -- I don't know, it's just ridiculous.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, civil liberties have gone down in the name of, you know, heightened security 'cause if you speak out against it --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- like everyone's like you're anti patriotic and just all these things.  I mean, like, you know, that's what freedom of speech is about, like --
R:  That's like the fifties, being blacklisted.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Like, we've got all these -- yeah, we've got all these actors and actresses like Susan, uh, Sarandon and what's her -- um, [MN] Tim Robbins --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- you know, like they're American, like, they're not against the country, they're just -- you know, don't agree with the policy and you can disagree with policies but still be pro American.
R:  Yeah, uh --
L:  And, like, they --
R:  -- and god forbid you say anything negative about the president, oh good gracious no. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, when he got elected, like, everyone's talking, like, so much shit about the guy, like completely ripping[?] in on him, you know, like just calling him a moron and everything and now it's like, oh, he's a hero.  Like he hasn't done shit.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He's screwed up the economy.
R:  He's still a moron. [LAUGH]
L:  He's screwed up the economy, he's, like, screwed up everything and like, you know, now he's like a hero and if you talk bad against him, "Oh my god, how can you say that?"  Like, it's, like, such hypocrisy and such bullshit. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ex- -- exactly.  Remember when he was elected, uh, it was less than half of the country who voted for him. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  So [LAUGH] half of us didn't like him to start with --
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  -- so, you know, all of a sudden it's -- I don't know, it just seems kinda crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can't have the jokes about him, good gracious no.
L:  I mean, and it was all there and it's still the same, if anything just screwed up even worse.  I mean, you would listen to the man speak and he can't even speak, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  And everybody's, "Oh, he went to Harvard".  Well, you know, when his father's got all that money and all the influence, yeah, like you can go there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can get like a C average or whatever, I mean, you know.
R:  Yeah, exactly, so we have a C --
L:  I can go to Harvard and get a C, too, I mean, you know.
R:  -- average student as our president, great. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can go to Harvard and get a C, you know, that's all right.  I can get a B but, you know -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, so just in gen- --
