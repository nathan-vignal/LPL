L:  Hello?
R:  Hi [LAUGH].
L:  Hi, this is Tracey from Michigan.
R:  This is Melanie, and I'm in Bloomington, Illinois.
L:  Oh, okay.  How are you?
R:  Oh, okay [LAUGH].
L:  Good [LAUGH].
R:  Is this the first call you've had for this?
L:  No, I've had two others.
R:  Okay, this is my first one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Is it?  Okay.  Yeah, it's actually pretty fun to do.  [SIGH] Um, so, the topic -- do you fly much?
R:  Um, not a lot, but, probably a coupla times a year.
L:  Yeah, that's like me, too, although I have not flown since September eleventh.
R:  Ah, because of that, or just --
L:  Um --
R:  -- by chance?
L:  -- [SIGH] a little of both -- I mean, I could have flown, but chose not to [SIGH], um, my sister flew, like, right after September eleven, and that -- and that just scared the heck out of me, um ...I don't know, I -- I guess I don't trust flying right now, still, so ...
R:  [inaudible] --
L:  Um, how -- how do you feel about it?
R:  Um, I think it didn't really affect me a whole lot --
L:  Really?
R:  -- um, maybe I should be more worried about it [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, as far as the airport security idea of the whole thing goes, that doesn't really make me feel a whole lot safer.
L:  It doesn't me either.
R:  Um, I feel like the people that want to do something like that, know the tricks -- know how to get through that -- avoid that type of situation.
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  And, so, that's more of my concern, is that, it's not the people like me that they go through and check your shoes and make you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, get frisked down and all that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's the people that know how to [LAUGH] --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- scam the system. [LAUGH] 
L:  Exactly, I -- I agree, and I do feel that, you know, I mean, if you -- if they're gonna do something, they're gonna do it, and they're obviously --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- more intelligent than what our security can do anything about anyways, so [SIGH] I just -- yeah, the whole thing really scares me, and -- and especially, I mean, I flew -- just before September eleventh -- I flew in, like, August --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of that year, and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- had my little girl with me, and I think that's what scares me the most -- 'cause if it was just me, or my husband -- that's different --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, I have two little kids --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?  So, that definitely, I mean, I don't know -- if someone wanted to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [NOISE] hijack my plane and take me and do whatever -- that's me, but, you know, when -- when you have kids it totally changes your -- your perspective on things.
R:  Right, I agree.
L:  So -- do you have children?
R:  Yeah, I have two daughters.
L:  Okay, yep, me too, so, I just -- that's kinda how I feel about the whole thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I just -- and I just read in the newspaper the other day that here, just in --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- 'cause I live in Sagana --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I don't know if you know where that's at, but, we have, um -- it's like right up by, um, kind of almost by the [inaudible] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- by the Sagana Bay --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- um, in Michigan, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we've just, like, a small airport here -- it's an international airport, but, [SIGH] the -- I mean, just within a month --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they confiscated, like, almost a thousand --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like, weapons, or whatever, you know, I'm just like --
R:  Oh, my.
L:  -- "Oh, my god", you know?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean, just in our little airport, you know?
R:  [MN]
L:  It was crazy.
R:  Our little airport here, um, isn't very big either, and -- I guess what I don't see, ah, the point of all this airport security is, we flew in, or picked my mom up, or something, and it was like nine o'clock on a Sunday night and there were about fifteen or sixteen people standing around --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that are these, supposedly, you know, the workers or whatever, and it just seems that they need to use their resources in a much more effective way.
L:  Right.
R:  If they're really gonna catch people.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, that's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of my biggest gripes about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- airport security, I guess [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Yeah, I -- I agree.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  [SIGH] I totally agree, because, I mean, I don't know how much training they went through, but, I know that they had just tonnes of ads for airport screeners and stuff, when -- when they put it in, um, our airport [SIGH], and I don't know what kind of training they went through, I mean, how do I know?  I mean, they didn't really seem to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- they just required that you be, you know, eighteen years or older, and I'm just like, [SIGH] "Okay, they don't require a whole lot for this, well how -- how good is the training?", you know?
R:  Right, you wonder what -- how effective they can really be.
L:  Exactly.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, I'm sure that they teach 'em what to look for, but I --
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  -- that doesn't make me feel any better.
R:  But, if they can teach them what to look for, the people that are trying to get through --
L:  You know --
R:  -- can learn the same thing, and --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- not look like that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, they know what they're looking for.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  So, yeah, I know, I just -- I'm not quite sure about flying yet, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we've -- we've discussed it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and, we just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have decided that wherever we're going, I mean --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- we just don't -- my brother in law lives in Arizona, and we used to go out there once a year in the spring to see him, and we haven't been out there since, like, ninety nine, I think, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not, I mean, that's when I had my first child and everything, but, um, you know, I mean, [MN] we're due to go out there, you know, because we used to go every year, but it's just too scary, and I just -- I don't know -- I -- I guess thousands and thousands of flights go on every single day, and nothing happens, but, it's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just my luck that I would get on the one --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that would [LAUGH] have something like that go on, you know?  And I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that scares me, I mean, I can't help but think of the little kids that were on the flights that were hijacked and stuff, you know, and I just -- that really bothers me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so [SIGH], I don't know, I guess, you just kinda --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do what you have to do, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I guess if we have to drive to Arizona, we probably will, so --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Yeah, my parents live out there, so that's quite a way [LAUGH].
L:  [MN] Do they?  Yeah, I know, but --
R:  We drove it once, and that was enough times for me.
L:  Wouldn't do it again, huh?
R:  Probably not [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] I think I just still need to get over the whole September eleventh thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it'll probably, you know -- I'll probably feel a lot better about it, but, um, you know, I -- my sister keeps telling me, "Oh, you have to just get back on the plane, and just do it", you know, she said, "That's why I got back on it", she said, "Because, I just had to prove my -- to myself that I could, and the longer you wait, the harder it's gonna be, and ..." --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so -- but, I don't know, I'm just -- it's kind of [MN] -- kind of scary to me still, I guess, but, I don't know, um, yeah, the -- the screening part, I don't necessarily know that that's helping a whole lot.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- [SIGH] who knows.
R:  I don't even know the purpose of some of the things they do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when they're doing all that.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, I guess like we were saying -- why they stop who they stop, or you know -- [MN] to me, the person in front of me is just as likely as I am --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of anything.
L:  Right.
R:  So, what causes a certain person to be stopped --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I guess it seems so random to me, that it doesn't seem like it could be very effective.
L:  Effective, right, and, yeah, I mean, I haven't actually --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- been through that, since I haven't flown since then, so -- but, my sister just said it's crazy.
R:  It is almost embarassing, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it happened to me a coupla times where, you know, I have to stand there and get my arms all spread out --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they take your shoes off, and your jacket off and everything, and [SIGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't know, it is kind of intimidating, or, makes you feel self conscious, I guess [LAUGH].
L:  Right, right.
R:  And then of course, my daughters think that's so funny, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  How old are they?
R:  Ah, thirteen and nine.
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Mine are little -- mine are four and eighteen months, so --
R:  Ok, okay.  [NOISE] 
L:  -- um, I just [SIGH] -- oh, yeah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I mean, well, I was -- it was -- I felt kind of that way when we came back -- we went to Jamaica in ninety six --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and when we came back -- back through into, um, the United States it was like -- I felt really, um, like they were just looking at you, like, "Okay, what did you bring back, and why did you bring it back?", and you know, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I felt kind of like, interrogated at that point, so, I can't even imagine --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- what it's like, you know, just flying domestically, what the security and everything is like, if they were like that with international -- I'm sure it's worse now -- so much worse now with international flights --
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words].
L:  -- so ... but, yeah, I'm not -- not too thrilled about it at the moment --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so [SIGH], we'll see, you know, it -- it could all change, just depending on, you know, the -- the way things go, but, I just keep hearing little things that happen and it's like, "I don't know".  [SIGH] 
R:  Yeah, just when you think it seems like things are getting kind of back to normal --
L:  R-
R:  -- you hear some story of some crazy person doing something.
L:  Right, right.
R:  And, that makes you wonder if, you know -- and then, I guess with the war stuff and all that, you feel like maybe there's people out to get America right now, again, or --
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely, especially since they can't find proof of why we were -- you know, why we went and did what we did and everything, so, it's kinda --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, [SIGH] everyone's gonna be looking at us, like, "Oh great, they just -- you just attack people for no reason, now", so [SIGH] ...
R:  Yeah, so, now you're fair game.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly, yeah, that's scary too -- life definitely is different now, than it was, even five years ago, it's just too scary --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you never know [SIGH] -- you never, never know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, I mean, it's, well -- kidnappings and everything too, I mean, I feel like I can't even put my kids in the backyard and play for a little while, you know?  It's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what?  Not like, I'd leave 'em out there alone, but, you know, it's like you have to keep your eye on 'em constantly, because it's like, you never know.
R:  Yeah, I made the decision a coupla years ago to homeschool my two children because where we had lived -- in the junior high there were stabbings --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- there were -- I mean, just terrible things [MN] and you think, if you can't even have your child going to school anymore and feeling safe about it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, that's a scary thing [LAUGH].
L:  Right, I know -- I've talked to my husband about ...
