L:  [MN]
R:  Hi, I'm Jenny from Arkansas.
L:  Hi, I'm Evan from Fort Lauderdale.
R:  Okay.  Well, we're supposed to talk about current unrest in the Middle East, and when I, --
L:  Yeah, that's right.
R:  -- and when I heard what the topic was, I was a little uneasy, because I wasn't sure I could hold up my end of the conversation.  Um, --
L:  Oh, well, I'll be -- I'll be fine, ah, I kind of, I actually, I'm going for a Masters in this sort of thing.
R:  Are you really?  Okay.
L:  -- yeah, in political science.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, um, the question is, what do each of you feel about the current unrest in the Middle East, and I guess --
L:  [MN] It's actually a vague question, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, if you really get down to specifics, [MN] the Middle East is a --
R:  -- is a big --
L:  -- sort of a, it's a western idea, we sort of create it in our minds, I mean, the people there, don't, you know, feel any affinity for o- other people in certain areas, I mean, they don't consider themselves to be part of the same group, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ah, whereas we sort of group them all together, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and sort of say, "Oh, well, this area, used to actually be" -- I don't know when they -- they changed, it used to be called the Near East, uh, you know, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- 'cause the East would be Japan, uh, and, you know, Soviet Union or something like that, so --
R:  I guess, the first thing I thought of was just the unrest in Iraq, or just, you know, it's not here, so --
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, either, either, either Iraq or with the -- the Palestinian Israeli stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I mean, [MN] I -- the question, as far as the question, will there be peace in the Middle East, I mean, you know, [MN] --
R:  Do you think, yeah, do you think the world -- different countries in the world would always be at war?  That -- that tends to be -- my -- my gut reaction i- is, no.
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, bu- -- I don't know if -- it's -- it's -- it's, always, not so much countries, you have -- you have -- [MN] the business with the Palestinians and the Israelis is sort of, you know, the United States is a complete supporter of Israel for nothing to do with, you know, Semitic or any kind of reasoning like that, it has essentially everything to do with -- I mean, they could be druids --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for all policy planners care.  It -- it matters about -- the -- the -- the Israeli government established itself long ago as basically a base for the United States, and it would go in and take military action, if anything ever happened in the Arabian peninsula, which is where basically all the-the-the -- the mass, like, people think, like, "Oh, it's the Middle East, everybody has oil", --
R:  Uh-huh, yeah.
L:  -- but -- but it's not -- it's not the case, like, uh, the -- the Arabian peninsula produces sixty percent of the world's energy, it doesn't go to the United States, you know, the United States gets a lot, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we get a lot of it from Venezuela, and Colombia, we get a lot from Latin America. Um, --
R:  Mhm, they're just one of the resources -- but by no means [MN] a majority resource.
L:  Right, [MN] but the thing is, is that power involves controlling the resources for other people, and we want to control the resources for, say, Europe or Japan, and to maintain our -- you know, just maintain superpower status over other emerging --  I mean, the whole idea of, like, the European Union, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it isn't just for, like, for fun.  I mean, they basically want, --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- they want to do it, because they, [MN] you know, the old saying, divide and conquer, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's easy to -- to conquer enemies that they're di- -- once they're divided, and that's what Europe was, and sort of still is, I mean, it's hard to, you know, it's hard to form  a -- it's like a labor union, you know , people form labor unions 'cause one person --
R:  Right, has no power.
L:  -- isn't going to be able to -- they have no leverage, exactly, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so, because you have no leverage, you form, and Japan is thinking about doing the same thing, calling it East Asian bloc, and trying to get --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- now, of course, it's hard, they're trying to get South Korea, North Korea, uh, Japan and Taiwan, ah, as a bloc --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- one, you know, one sort of like the EU, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, of course, they would be formidable, but, anyway, but back to the Middle East, I mean, there'll be -- there could be peace, [MN] you know, for the Palestinian conflict, if -- if the United States really wanted it, but we basically -- we let it -- I mean, it's a military occupation, --
R:  Yeah.  And --
L:  -- ah, that the Is- -- that the Palestinians have been under, and they're absolutely desperate, and people think that they're, you know, Islam or any of that business, I mean, the Palestinians, there was no suicide bombings for -- for years, for decades, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, they were under occupation, living in internment camps for -- for decades, now, they're in, like, the thirty some odd year of, you know, of this occupation, and, you know, for the last -- s- since the desperation has really set in, you know, in the last ten years, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, people have been exploding themselves, I mean, you know, it takes [LAUGH] -- it takes some -- you know, you got to be in a real mental state --
R:  Yeah.  To -- to --
L:  -- to blow yourself -- to blow yourself up, I mean, [MN] --
R:  -- consider that a reasonable option.
L:  Yeah, I mean, exactly, I mean, and religion or no religion, I mean, I could make up a religion right now, and -- that ordered people to blow themselves up, but, you know, I wouldn't be able to find too many takers, --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- that's for sure.
R:  -- too many volunteers.
L:  You know, but, over there, when you have that kind of condition, you know, you get people who [MN] --
R:  Mhm.  The people are, are ex- --
L:  -- you know, it's, like, "Hey, hey", --
R:  -- the people want to do it, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- their families consider it honorable that they are blown up.
L:  Right, yeah, exactly, I mean, it -- it makes -- it makes sense, it's r- -- actually rational, ah, --
R:  That's scary.
L:  -- you know, rational thinking, exactly, and so, you know, the only way, the real -- only way to get peace over there, is, you know, is to end the mi- -- end the occupation, ah, and even [LAUGH] then --
R:  Do you think --
L:  -- even then, you're -- you're dealing generations of -- of built up hatred, and that would have to take generations to go away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The same way that d- desegregation in the South, oh, in this country, you know, racial hatred still really hasn't gone away.  Now, it's made dra- drastic improvements, you know, there's not lynchings, --
R:  Mhm, but it's, yeah --
L:  Ah, --
R:  -- but it's not --
L:  -- but it -- but it takes time, it does take time, and, you know, without -- for, you do -- they do have to take the initial steps of ending the policy that's the problem, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so, it -- but, and in -- in terms of Iraq, uh, you know, I don't know, it's still fresh.
R:  You know, a war is big business, I mean, uh, --
L:  Yeah, yeah, right, sure, sure, there's that -- that end of it, the -- th- the money that goes in- into war, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it is -- it is big business, I mean, it costs four billion dollars a month for Iraq right now, --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- ah, and all the contracts and all that stuff, you know, where -- give out oil contracts, or whatever.
R:  For us to remain involved, I wonder, what's our motivation to get out, when we -- when our economy's improved, and the stock market is going up, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, uh, if everybody's happy, then it's not nearly as profitable.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Of course, --
L:  -- yeah, I mean, the -- the thing is, is that, you know, people, well, at least, the elite, the elites that run and own the media aren't -- you know, basically, the -- the reflections and opinions of mass media reflect the opinions of the owners, ah, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and producers, and editors, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, a- and so, you'll --
R:  Not necessarily -- necessarily -- ah, --
L:  -- know when -- you'll know, you'll know whe- -- you'll know i- -- when elites have turned against the war, when they really just start slamming the war, but elites won't turn on the war for moral reasons, 'cause it's not how it works.  They'll turn on the war for the same reason they turned on the Vietnam War, they're going to say, this war is too expensive.  This war is causing all these other problems --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- outside of it.  Like, basically, in ninety sixty eight, elites turned on the Vietnam War, after Tet.  Now that -- you know, they never said, "Oh, you know, after ten years of napalming small children, I'm now against the war", --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they said, "Okay, that's what" -- I mean, if you go back and you read, and you go to the library, and you read th- the newspapers, people, you know, come out, and, you know, big shots, like, lawyers, would come out and have press conferences, and they would give their reasons for why they're against the war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all of a sudden, you know, in ninety sixty eight, and the reasons were always, like, "Oh, our streets are in turmoil", you know, [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, let's take care of ours- --
L:  -- people are running around, and so, -- a- and those are the reasons that people are going to be, -- the elites are going to be against the war, it's not going to be some kind of ethical, anything, you know, this was bad, and all this --
R:  Mhm, this was a bad idea --
L:  -- other stuff, they're going to be, like, "Look, this war is capital intensive, this war is dragging down the economy, this", you know, because that's what it is, I mean, it is a business, but it's also -- it's a drain kind of business, I mean, i- it's spending, it can stimulate the economy, but it's -- it's not, it's, you know, like, there's capital intensive and labor intensive, capital intensive is just money, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you just kind of throw it away, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's like buying a computer, --
R:  Kind of pour it in a hole.
L:  -- whereas, right, exactly, but if you're -- you know, you know, if you're going to spend money, and you, you, say, you build a hospital, or you build a school, ah, you employ a bunch of people, right --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you employ people to build the school, ah, well, then, that -- that money is going to go a long way, 'cause you're spending it right at the bottom, you know, you're getting people who are working, money in their, in their pockets, instead of sort of, you know, buying, if you, you know, I forget how much a Tomahawk missile costs, or something like that, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- one point eight million dollars, well, that's just, like a firecracker, you know, [LAUGH] -- it just -- it blows up and it's gone, so, yeah, you still there?
R:  Yeah, I'm here.
L:  Okay , now, I -- I wasn't sure, my -- my phone cut off.  So, --
R:  So, should we remain involved in the peace process?
L:  Yeah, -- oh, oh, yeah, I mean --
R:  I mean -- I guess we always will, that's just the United States --
L:  Right.
R:  -- position, as kind of a -- a world leader.
L:  [MN] Right, I mean, it's -- it's -- it's partly being a world leader, I mean, we've always been -- we always play both sides, I mean we --
R:  We've always been, yeah.
L:  -- we've -- we've used, I mean, th- the PLO for instance, is the most corrupt third world organisation I [NOISE] believe, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I can't -- that I can even name, I mean, it's a joke of a -- of an organization, I mean, you know, they've got Arafat, who's sort of authoritarian, now, if the Palestinians had Gandhi, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they -- they would have much more leverage, because basically, they have no -- they have no material leverage, they're basically living under occupation in camps.  They have no country, I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- mean, they've just been taken over, so, it's, like, you know, according to the Geneva Convention, I mean, they have the right to fight back --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- if they're under occupation, but it's, like, nobody -- nobody cares, [LAUGH] I mean, --
R:  Yeah.
L:   -- you know, the Europeans are more sympathetic, just because they don't have any stake, whereas the United States, like I said, they have a -- they have a stake, and the -- the energy policy, and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- with the, ah, protectors, which are basically -- Israel's basically a protector country, it protects the oil interest, ah, in the countries to the south, in the Arabian peninsula, and it -- this is an old policy, it isn't -- it isn't -- it almost doesn't make much sense for now, it, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it sort of d- developed under Kissinger, but it, it -- they called it, the State Department at the time called it, uh, local, local gendarmes, it's a French word, basically means cop.  You know, police --
R:  Yeah, so we'll con- -- we'll continue to be involved in what's going on with other countries.
L:  Oh, absolutely, yeah, I mean, that's -- that's part of power, I mean, --
R:  That's [MN].  Yeah.
L:  -- if -- if we weren't involved, then we don't have power.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, in fact, that's -- that's kind of how
