L:  Roman.
R:  [MN] Karen.  Hello?
L:  Hey, how you doing?
R:  Fine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Good, good.
R:  Where are you at?
L:  Um, I'm in, um, south of Chicago.
R:  Ah, --
L:  How about you?
R:  Um, Tacoma, Washington.  [LAUGH]
L:  Tacoma?
R:  Yeah.
L:  How's the weather like over there?
R:  Um, muggy and cloudy.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  But warm.
L:  How was your Fourth of July?
R:  It was great.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, so --
L:  So --
R:  -- um, the subject is the Middle East, and how you feel.
L:  The Middle East, what do you think?
R:  What do I think?  I think that, um, America -- I kind of feel they don't belong there, that we didn't belong there, getting into a lot of issues, um, with Israel, and -- and the -- them -- uh, I can't remember the name of the other count-, um, --
L:  Iraq?
R:  -- well, well, Iraq, is, like, yeah, we had some business going into Iraq and get rid of people that were, you know, talking bad about the United States and -- and spreading a lot of gossip through the world, and -- with their [SIGH] hate and stuff like that, um, but I just don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, realistically, um, one.  You said you don't feel like we should have participated, but why do you feel like that?
R:  I don't feel like we should be participating with, um, Israel, and the peace process going on over there, I feel, like, you know, we stuck -- we p- -- we put that situation there back in the nineteen, um, forty -- after World War Two, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- we put that [MN] that there, and we're over there, the ones trying to put peace there too, and we're always standing in the middle of all their problems, and I just think somebody -- you know, like, England or somebody else should go over there and be the middle man for a change, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- because th- they both don't like the US.
L:  Right, now, you said they -- they said a lot of stuff that they shouldn't have said.  Now, what about free speech?  I mean, that's what we're doing, right.  We're -- we're fighting for freedom, in --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the sense that we have that right as civilians.  Now, the rest of the world, they shouldn't have a voice?
R:  Mm, I think they need to have more of a voice, I think more people other than just the United States needs to be in there, you know, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- voicing opinions and trying to -- to go with peace, I believe in world peace, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but at this point I don't see it coming any time soon, I only see, you know, matters being worse right now, like, we're being attacked in Iraq still, and stuff, and I think they pulled too many of the soldiers out of there too soon in Iraq, but, --
L:  Now, I served this country for three years, and I'm a patriot to heart.  When you say they said a lot of bad things about the United States, do you watch the news, do you watch, like, the regular news or --
R:  I watch -- I watch --
L:  -- or do you watch, like, CNN, or --
R:  I watch the local news with the world news about once or twice a week, you know, and catch up on everything going on over there, and, you know, my husband served in the military, too, and -- and I, you know, believe in supporting our guys, but I think the United States pulled too soon out of Iraq, thinking that, "Oh, that was easy, and now let's take our guys home", and now, these other guys that are left over there are, I don't think there's enough of them to hold off the terror attacks on 'em.
L:  Well, there -- there's not.  There's not, yeah.
R:  And I -- I think the, you know, in the long run, the United States, you know, has backed away from th- those and they're not protecting our people enough.
L:  Yeah, you're right.
R:  So, you know --
L:  They need to have a larger body of --
R:  Yes, they do --
L:  -- soldiers there.
R:  -- and they should have stayed over there a lot -- lot, you know, and you know, when you go into a country, you're going to have to stay there for years to put that country back together, you can't just come down to a skeleton crew and think everything's going to go great, not when they've never -- you know, they didn't get -- Saddam hid pretty much.
L:  Right, well, they can't verify it, anyway.
R:  Yeah, so, yeah.
L:  So, you said we should let some other country step in the middle of it.  Do you think another country would enforce, --
R:  Oh, --
L:  -- or would want the same thing that we want?
R:  Some countries would.  England, I feel, would, France, no way, France has -- has never been much at fighting anyway, they always let other people do their fighting for them, um, but, you know, England, Canada, them, -- I think they need to put more of the action in, if they want world peace, they need to help more. [MN]
L:  So why would you think nobody else is involving themselves with that?
R:  Um, they don't, just -- they don't put much commitment out there, they're a little bit backed by the US, are they putting the forces over there like the US is, no, they're putting a few over there, to say they're helping, but they're not, I don't believe they are.  I believe it's mostly just us going in there, and, you know, all of the Middle East just, you know, starting to hate the United States for jumping into everything over there, and --
L:  But would you think that would be one reason why nobody else wants to be th- the front person for -- or the front country for world peace?
R:  That's true, that is -- that would be, you know, because it does put some resentment.
L:  Now, would you think -- I'm sorry, would you say that th- the US government tells you the truth, tells you partial truth, or tells you what they want you to believe?
R:  Uh, they tell us what they want us to believe.
L:  So, would, would --
R:  Ah, --
L:  -- believing in that, or as you just said, do you think that these people are getting upset because we just want world peace, or, for instance, no?
R:  No, I believe it's the terrorists that are out there planting seeds in -- in other countries, you know, that are having problems themselves, like, they've been over in Russia, and, you know, you get those sentiments, saying we don't like the United States and this and that over in Russia, and, um, North Korea -- I -- I believe it's the terrorists out there planting little seeds -- "Oh, see what the United States did here?", and making something big out of something little, to make it look like, "Oh, yeah, now look what they're doing, you know?"  I -- I just believe it's little seeds being planted by terrorists --
L:  But --
R:  -- in several countries that are --
L:  Now, would you say people just are vicious by nature, vicious by reason, or vicious because they have nothing better else to do than -- to pick on one of the world's leaders, -- in industry, um, just in anything that we do here, is big news, e- everywhere, like, say, we have the most tourists, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we have the most, um, spending power, we have better products, but do we really have better products?
R:  Ah, I believe we have better -- a more innovative society in people thinking up the ideas, but, when it comes to bettering them, I think you're looking at Japan being, you know -- taking an idea and making it a lot better.
L:  Okay, so, --
R:  [COUGH] Excuse me.
L:  -- people are, are, just jealous of the United States, or have we really lost our customs, our customs, to [inaudible] saying, we have no values, now, say [inaudible] Europe, for instance, they have the culture as far as tradition, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you think that upsets people, because we don't follow tradition as much as we should, like, say, in the early nineteen hundreds or the fourteen hundreds, when everything was proper, we had, um, just common laws, +etiquette in public, or just the way that we presented ourselves as early Americans, now, we've lost that, do you think that could be a reason, like, say, the people in the Middle East, their women aren't allowed to wear what they want to wear, they have to wear, uh -- they have to be concealed in -- in that sense, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because that's something that -- that's of value, traditional value, that they have -- do you think they look at that and say, we're just too liberal?
R:  They possibly could be looking at some of that, saying we are too liberal, but, you know, um, that would be the men, the women don't want, you know, a lot of them look to us being more liberal -- when you suppress somebody, you know, they want to cut, [LAUGH] you can't suppress them forever, you can't flay somebody forever, and --
L:  Well, that's, that's true.
R:  -- and I feel that the Middle Eastern women are pretty much enslaved.
L:  Okay, so, with that society and our society, what would make you feel like would give them a reason to say something bad about the United States, or do you think that we just w- -- as far as industry is concerned, we want their oil, we want whatever --
R:  I don't think we, you know, --
L:  -- resources they have.
R:  -- oil, yeah, it's pretty important, but I don't think it's important enough that we need to go over there and -- and have war, and I don't think that's what, in the long run, what we're after, um, [MN] 'cause other countr-, you know -- South America has oil, we have our own oil, there -- you know, there is areas for oil, so, I -- you know, I think it's a lot of big bus-
