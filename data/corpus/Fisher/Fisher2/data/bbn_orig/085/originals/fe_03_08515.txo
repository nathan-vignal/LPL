L:  Ah, my name is Courtney.
R:  My name is Joy [MN].
L:  Hi Joanne.
R:  [MN] Hi, how are you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  I'm okay.
L:  Um --
R:  Um.
L:  -- so, the topic is the salaries of sport professionals?
R:  Yeah, and if they deserve that much.
L:  Okay, what's your feelings on that?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, I kinda feel they do actually deserve the amount they get --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I don't -- I'm not really sure how -- like, how they [inaudible], if it's like, you know -- I think, well, isn't there a kid that just got, like, um twenty million, or something like that, for Nike?
L:  Yeah, I think --
R:  [several inaudible words] -- 
L:  Yeah, I don't --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I don't pay too much attention to sport, but I know how much they get paid to play the sport gets really ridiculous, like, up in the millions for a season, so ...
R:  And this -- this kid, this particular one, he's just outta high school, and he just --
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  -- yeah, and that's just for Nike, um, sponsorship for, you know, him to represent Nike --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think he got around twenty million, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's ridiculous, but --
L:  Yeah, I personally think it's -- it's getting out of hand, like, I work, um, I work as a school teacher in New York City, and, you know, I'm just a student teacher right now, I'm in college, but, the salaries teacher makes is nothing compared to what athletes get, and it's just -- just personally, you know, I think teachers have more of an important job, and it's like, I think entertainment's great, and the sports industry is, you know, really doing great things, and everybody enjoys it -- it's like, the most popular thing in the country, but still, I mean, things are skewed as far as salaries go, and what -- what's valued in this country, you know?
R:  That's very true.
L:  Yeah, so I think in that --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- case it could definitely be -- be renegotiated would be a positive aspect [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, when you put it like that, and you compare it to, you know, the teacher's salary --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what -- what they do is just a form of entertainment, and you watch it, and enjoy it, and it's like a few hours long --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, you're done --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, yeah, when you put it like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You have a lot more responsibilities than -- than they would.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  And, it's also like, I just think like, that much money gets absolutely ridiculous, like, what do you do with twenty million dollars when you're right out of high school, you know?
R:  Yeah, he's like seventeen years old, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's how much he's making for just signing on with Nike, so ...
L:  Ay yi yi [SIGH].
R:  It's -- it's -- it's getting -- it's getting crazy because they -- they're not like, humanitarians, they're not doing anything, you know, to save the world or anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's not that direct[?] [inaudible].
L:  Right, right, like -- [inaudible] important, like people love sports, and it's great entertainment, but, you know, twenty million dollars for a Nike commercial, it's just --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- yeah, money has just gotten really out of hand, and, um, I know, like, way back in -- I wanna say the tw- -- there was this one guy -- this one politician who wanted -- he'd this philosophy where he wanted all the -- kind of like Robin Hood -- like, all the rich to be -- like, ten percent of everybody's millions to be redistributed to the poor, and it's almost like -- like, of course that would never happen, but it's just -- you think about this day and age where we have such poverty, but then, you know, seventeen year olds getting twenty million dollars for a Nike commercial, and it's just -- the proportions are, you know, you kind of raise your eyebrow at that, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  [several inaudible words] is such, ah, depression and a state of turmoil in the actual, you know, financial effect of the world right now --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if they -- if they did do that, that would be a different story, but, you know, people are greedy.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's unrealistic at this point, you know, there's --
R:  Yes, [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- yeah, nobody would change their money over for that.  I wonder how much percentage, like, if sports people maybe did more with charity, and maybe like a large chunk of every million they made went to something like that, like, some sort of social fund, um -- I wonder how many people -- like, I'm not familiar with sports at all, I really -- I really don't watch anything, but, um, I think that would be -- I would definitely condone that ... if anybody ...
R:  I mean, it -- it's -- it's kinda strange because they have to pay a lot of people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they have -- they have a lot of people on their payroll that they -- they have to pay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, in order for them to make that much and with taxes being taken out of the money, even before they get the money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it -- it's reduced dramatically, you know, so ...
L:  That's really true, yeah.
R:  And they -- it -- it's like a -- it's a whole, you know, business they have to run, and --
L:  Right, it's turned into industry, definitely.
R:  -- so, [MN] it's -- it's a whole [several inaudible words] like, [inaudible] different aspects you have to look at it from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but I -- [MN] twenty million is just kinda -- just ridiculous, but --
L:  Yeah, I mean, I'm -- I'm twenty years old and I can't fathom somebody paying me twenty million dollars to do something, you know, I can't even fathom that -- and I don't think I ever could.
R:  I'm -- I'm twenty one -- I'm --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and I don't even think I'll ever see twenty million. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] oh, definitely -- oh, definitely [LAUGH] -- de- -- you know, even the word million is just kind of like --
R:  I know, I know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- just fantastical saying in my vocabulary.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, I'm never even gonna be able to, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- obtain a million dollars [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, yeah. 
L:  And, it's funny, just celebrities in general, it's just, you know, that this small percentage of the population is put on a pedestal and paid so much, it's just -- I just always get curious like how everyday people turn into these celebrities and get paid so much, it's curious, you know?  Like, what separates you in your life, and getting up, and brushing your teeth, and those little things, from somebody who's, you know, sitting on a coupla million dollars and doing the same thing, you know?
R:  You mean, what makes them so special for them to ...
L:  Mhm, I hope -- yeah, I -- anybody walking around with a coupla million better feel special [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Um, but, yeah, I don't know, I wouldn't -- I don't know if it's, I mean, I doubt there would be any reform in the millions that the, you know, sports players get paid, but, I know people -- I know -- I saw a lot of ads where fans, like, would be at -- at games, and they'd be upset because in the sports columns in the newspapers, you don't read about, you know, oh -- like, I know when Sammy Sosa had the thing about the bat -- the fake -- the fake bat, and there was cork in it --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, cork in it.
L:  -- and it wasn't regulations, people were excited to read about that, because for once they weren't arguing over how much somebody was getting fined for, or how much somebody won on their new contract -- for once it wasn't about money, it was just about the game, [SIGH] um, and I think that's important, when at least reporting on sports, like, who cares how much they're getting paid, because obviously it's not gonna change and the fans have no say in it, [SIGH] so, to see more said about the actual game would definitely be an improvement, I think.
R:  That -- that's true --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, yeah, I actually feel that way too, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's the -- it's also the whole fact that these kids are -- are skipping college, you know, just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for the -- the love of money and the actual opportunity to make millions --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're skipping college and -- and most of them, ah, a high percentage of them, you know, actually do not -- with basketball anyways, if you don't get chosen for the draft --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then you aren't eligible to go to college after that.
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  Yeah [inaudible] --
L:  -- oh, goodness.
R:  -- if you put your name in the draft pool for that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- basketball, and, um, your -- you actually won and you actually hire a agent -- as soon as you hire an agent --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're -- you're done with, it's either you go pro or you're just done forever --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- you can't play college, you can't -- you -- you can go to college, but you can never play college ball, like, you know?
L:  Play college basketball, right.
R:  Right, so ...
L:  Oh, that's extreme, I wasn't aware of that.
R:  Yeah, so, and -- and -- I mean, the reason they do it is because -- it's also the thing if -- if -- even in football, if you get injured, you know, your -- your value goes down in the -- in the -- in the money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- facet, and then, you know, if -- will you be able to play again?  So, these people feel, you know, [several inaudible words] to the money instead of, you know, why am I going to need an education?
L:  Right, right, yes --
R:  So, they just --
L:  -- you're being offered so much money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- definitely education takes a back seat.
R:  I mean, that's what you're going to school for anyway --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm not going to school, you know, just to [LAUGH] -- to see people everyday, no -- going to school with a hope --
L:  No, you're going to get the education to get paid, right, you --
R:  -- right, right, with the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hope that you're going to be making money later --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, a lot of them don't even get chosen for the draft school, so therefore, you know, their whole lives surround around these sports that they're involved in, and --
L:  Right, and then it just comes down to that one decision.
R:  Yeah, so a lot of people --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- are giving up a lot for -- for money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, I mean, with the time that's going on now, and how the world's going --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all the war and stuff, they just like --
L:  Right.
R:  -- need the -- you know, some relief of our everyday things that we actually do.
L:  Right, right, oh, definitely, I think s- -- yeah, I -- it definite -- like, I know that somebody's giving you the statistic, like, sports is by far more popular than, like, film and music and other industry types, um, just 'cause it's so relatable and there's so many forms of it, um --
R:  Right.
L:  So, yeah, I definitely think it's important and I would never want to see anything change that would, like, debilitate it, you know?  Um ... but, yeah, it's just, I guess, I don't know, it's -- it's funny with this topic, I don't think about the sports --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- salaries too much [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- not really my alley. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, they -- they give you some weird ones, I don't know ...
L:  Yeah, yeah, um, and anyways --
R:  I don't even understand the whole system of this, right, I mean --
L:  Yeah, I've been getting calls, but, I know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and you're supposed to stick to the topic for ten minutes, and it's always like, so ... sports salaries. 
R:  I don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I don't understand it -- are they actually listening to these, and getting our opinions and stuff, or ...?
L:  I think it's [MN] -- it's like speech patterns and how people relate to strangers, like, how comfortable somebody is just launching into their opinion, and I think they're hoping to get clashing opinions, but so far everyone I've talked to is like, "Yeah, I agree -- that's cool", [LAUGH] so --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- I don't know how interesting it is.
R:  I can't wait 'til I get a -- you know, somebody that doesn't agree with what I say, because --
L:  Yeah, that would be much more easy to make the ten minutes go by.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  It's like, "Yes, sports salaries are ridiculously high" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's true, um --
R:  Um, that would -- that would be more entertaining than, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just ...
L:  Yeah, I guess, I don't know what type of person would really sit down and be like, "No, this is too much money ...", you know, like, I guess somebody who's really into seeing, like, they'd have to be in favor on some sort of reform where change would happen, but, you know, I can't think of any extremist group ...
