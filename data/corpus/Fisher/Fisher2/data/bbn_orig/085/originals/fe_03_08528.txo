L:  Noelene Wilson.
R:  Hi, I'm Alex.
L:  Okay.  I'm sorry but I couldn't hear what she said.  Did you hear what she said?
R:  Oh, the topic?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, ah, professional athletes and strikes.  How do you feel about the recent strikes they've had and do you feel that they deserve the contracts or the money that they're getting?
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, I'm really not into sports that much, so I really -- I don't know whether I should take this call or not, but ah, no, I really think they're making too much money now.
R:  I think everyone feels that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But in -- in one way though, I mean, the argument that I hear in favor of them making all that money is they wouldn't be taking it somebody wasn't offering it.
L:  Well that's true too.  And somebody's got to --
R:  So, I mean, I don't know if you heard about that player a few years ago that ah, the baseball player who got like, twenty five million dollars a year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- which I think's very ridiculous, but when you think about it, what was he supposed to say?  He didn't ask for twenty five million, somebody outbid the other people by a lot --
L:  Well --
R:  -- and is he really supposed to say, "No.  No thanks".
L:  Well, they could, you know, I mean, you know -- [LAUGH] Yeah if you're going to be offered it from somewhere, yeah, you're going to say yeah, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Understand -- 
L:  Like I said, I don't really know that much about it, but I mean, you know, they -- they do make real good money, but you -- you're right, you know, I mean if somebody -- if they're not going to pay you that fee then of course you're going to get paid somewhere else better, well then of course you're going to go to it.
R:  Yeah, so it's kind of hard to -- to expect um -- because I hear, you know, I follow sports and I hear on like, the radio, the sports shows and they kind of want it both ways.  They talk and they complain about the players getting a lot of money but every now and then you hear somebody turning down more money so they could stay at a city they're happy with, because their families are -- they don't want to move their family around --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you hear them criticizing the players saying, you know, this guy doesn't care about winning or whatever, he's just, you know, he has no interest, he just wants a pay check and I think, oh, we kind of want it both ways.  We criticize them and we say they're dumb when they don't take the money but then we criticize them when they do take the money.
L:  Yeah, that's true too.
R:  But ah, I don't know.  But, you know, sports is supposed to be kind of like fun and entertainment and it does leave a bad taste in your mouth when you see them striking.  It's kind of hard to be sympathetic when they make, I think in baseball they make about, the average player just makes about two or three million a year.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So when you hear them going on strike, you know, when they -- what are they fighting for?  More, you know, when I think of strikes and labors -- labor unions, I think of trying to make conditions at work bearable and stuff like that.  They making, you know two, three million a year.
L:  Well that's pretty damn good money.
R:  I could live on that. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know, I wish the rest of us could make that good money.
R:  Yeah --
L:  I think if I could make two or three million dollars a year, I don't think I would be striking.
R:  Yeah, that's how most of us feel, so it's kind of hard to -- to be sympathetic.  I stopped following basketball, for example, just because of the last strike.  There was a player saying, "Yeah, we make a lot of money but we also spend a lot of money."
L:  Yeah.
R:  I thought that was one of the dumbest things I heard.  It's like --
L:  Well of course.
R:  -- you want sympathy because you spend money?
L:  I know, because, you know, I mean, and not only that, and yeah, people who have more money, naturally you're going to wind up spending more money.  But then too, not only then, when you go to these here ah, sports -- sports things you wind up spending so much money, like for a coke or a hotdog or --
R:  Oh, that's what gets me.  And football, I think you pay around thirty five dollars, depending what city you live in, about thirty five dollars parking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's a crime.
L:  It is.  That's kind of ridiculous.  So, yeah, I believe they're, you know, in a way I just think they're just a little bit -- I think it should be toned down, that's what I think.  Not only just for -- I mean for the whole -- all -- all everyone, you know?
R:  Yeah --
L:  There should be a -- I don't know, a set --
R:  A limit?
L:  A set limit or something.
R:  Yeah, but at the same time I think that's ridiculous, I would never pay that amount.  But you see these games sold out and you know, well, somebody is paying it.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, part of me says it's kind of hard to -- to blame 'em.  Okay maybe -- maybe they shouldn't ask for that much, but if people continue to be foolish enough to pay the money, then I don't see why they're going to stop.
L:  Well that's true too, you know, and naturally they're going to -- I mean, if one's going to do it the rest of them are going to do it too.  But no, I'm kind of, you know, like, if ah, I mean money, yeah, money's nice and money's important but I think sometimes that, you know, your family is more important of course.  And you should, you know, if you want to say somewhere and be with your family instead of making extra money, like you was talking about a while ago --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I kind of think that would be better.
R:  Yeah, I think that's admirable.
L:  You know, because you can't take money with you, when you leave this world.
R:  Right.
L:  And ah, so some of them I do believe they just get -- they do really -- they really do, they get outrageous.
R:  Some of these --
L:  I don't -- I don't know if they -- how long have they been making such big -- big money?
R:  Ah, since about the -- somewhere in the seventies when they were -- before, it used to be the owners controlled it, they owned you.  Kind of like ah, the movies, the same thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You signed a contract with them, they can do whatever they want with you and you can't leave.  Then in the seventies they went to court and they said, okay, you can't do that, you can just sign them for sort of contracts and then they can go wherever they want.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I mean, I remember about twenty years ago hearing a million dollars a year and thinking, "Wow, that guy's getting a million a year."
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now they're talking about guys ten, twelve, sixteen million dollars a year.
L:  My gosh.  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I mean, it kind of makes me upset at my parents for not forcing me to play baseball or something. [LAUGH] 
L:  I know.
R:  That could have been me.
L:  I know.  I wish -- I wish now sometimes I wished I could -- you know, knew how to do all that kind of stuff.
R:  Some of these guys aren't even good.
L:  No they're not.  A lot of them are not good, I mean, like I said, I'm not into sports that much but sometimes when I do watch 'em --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I -- I think to myself, you know, I don't -- they're not that good.  I mean, you know, I -- I just don't really think they are.  I think they make a whole lot more than the president of the United States does, don't they?
R:  Oh, the president makes, I don't know, two hundred, three hundred thousand a year.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  Well I could even live on that.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I think I could settle on that. [LAUGH] I wouldn't go on strike.
L:  [LAUGH] I know it, I know it.  Well what state do you live in?
R:  California.
L:  Oh well see, I -- I live in Houston, Texas and so -- like I say, I don't really watch sports that much and I don't keep up with it that much, but then, you know, a little bit here in Houston when I have been watching, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- now and then and everything and I think to myself, you know, I don't really like -- like this sports but when I start sitting there, start watching it, I kind of do get interested in it.
R:  Well I like it, but I think kind of when you hear about the money and when you hear about the players getting in trouble with the law, for example --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's where it kind of spoils it because you like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you like for it to be innocent, you know.  For a lot guys it's that thing where you remember your dad taking you for the first game and you like to do that with your son but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you don't really feel like you can relate to the players any more.  They're all out of touch and ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you don't really want them cheering some of these players because you know they're not good -- some of them are not good people.  Some are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But unfortunately it seems like they're being outnumbered by the bad ones.
L:  Yeah, because they -- you know, yeah, you do hear a lot about that.  I'm thinking to myself, I mean, if you're making that much money why do you want to be so bad?  And I'm just wondering if these -- a lot of these baseball players and stuff, if they're just ah, contributing towards charities and helping others with all that money.  It seems to me like they should be.
R:  Well you see, some of them are, though unfortunately, you don't hear that in the news, which kind of gets me upset, ah, because there should be some balance.  If they're going to report the bad stuff when they get in trouble, which they should, then they should al- -- also report the good stuff though, so, you know, I'd like to know who -- who are the good people there and, you know, who I can cheer and stuff like that, but ah, unfortunately they don't get much publicity.
L:  Mm.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Is it the, like -- like they make big money, is that -- is that for all the ball games?  Or is it for wrestling or just what?  Wrestling and other things or is it just ?
R:  I don't know if wrestling gets it.  Mainly the big ones, baseball, football, basketball, hockey.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Then you have other sports like um, boxing.  Just the best get the big money, and that's just a real small handful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The rest of the people are, you know, you'll get a few hundred or a few thousand but of that few thousand you gotta pay -- they gotta pay everyone.  They gotta pay their trainers and the people who fix them up when they get cut up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they gotta pay their managers.  So, you get the money but then you gotta pay everyone
