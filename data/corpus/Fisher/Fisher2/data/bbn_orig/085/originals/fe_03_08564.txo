L:  Hi.  I'm Laura.
R:  Hi.  I'm Diane.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Did you hear the topic?
L:  Ah, yeah.
R:  Okay.  What was it?
L:  Something about heightened airport security -- does it affect terrorism?
R:  Oh, okay.  I -- I missed it for some reason.
L:  Yeah.  Something about that. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, well, I guess, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's probably a good measure, um, to, you know, hopefully deter, you know, people --
L:  Right.
R:  -- from doing, you know, any kind of acts.
L:  Yeah.  I just -- I can't see where it would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  I don't think it makes a difference.  I think if people are determined, somehow, some way they'll figure it out.  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  H- --
R:  Just put 'em through a little more grief before they [LAUGH] figure it out. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But it seems like the people they're putting through grief are, like, i- -- people that they shouldn't.  Like, I've heard spread stories in the paper about, you know, checking elderly people and babies that were wrapped up and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, really, [NOISE] kind of, odd things but I guess it could be anybody.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I know, um, my son, he was, um, about six months --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- at the time and we were at the airport and they, [LAUGH] like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- had a wand and they took it all over him.
L:  [MN]
R:  They made us take our shoes [NOISE] off.  It w- -- it was really crazy and --
L:  M- --
R:  -- I thought, "Well, you know, I shouldn't, I guess --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- be upset about it because, you know, they're really trying to do a good thing" I guess.
L:  Right.  Well, I haven't been [NOISE] f- -- I haven't flown since all that happened, you know, September eleventh so I really don't know a whole lot if it's increased any.  'Cause I know the few times I flew before that, you know, it didn't seem -- all you did was walk through that little, you know, metal detector thing and put your bags on a belt and that was it.
R:  Right.
L:  And to me, I thought, "Well, that's, kinda, crazy".  I mean [MN] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What can they see, you know?  I mean, d- -- [MN] I don't know.  It just seems, like, if people --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- wanna do it, they could.
R:  Right.  Well, I do know too, um, when we were at the actual, you know -- for the carry on bags, I know some people -- it was very strange --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- were, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- searched very well.  Like, their bag was completely opened up and gone through and all kind- --
L:  Huh.
R:  And then some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people were just passed right through.
L:  Right.  Well, that's where I was saying, you know, it seems like they're y- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- pointing out the people that I -- I don't know.  I mean, the elderly people and that.  It's, like, what's --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I can't see them bringing anything --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- on but from the stories we've read it's those people that they're really searching and it just doesn't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- make sense to me.
R:  Mhm.  Well, you know too, I wonder, um, maybe they're doing the ran- -- you know, there's so many thousands and thousands of people, maybe they're doing the random thing and that's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- supposed to be a deterrent.
L:  Yeah.  That could be 'cause I --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I know we live right by O'Hare Airport.
R:  Okay.  Mhm.
L:  So, ah, they've, you know -- I can imagine the people that go through there but -- I don't know.
R:  Right.
L:  I still don't think ...
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I don't know.  I like the whole the -- idea about the air marshals.  You know, putting them on the planes with the guns?
R:  Oh, yes. [LAUGH]
L:  I thought that was a good idea but I -- I don't know.  I just -- I don't know how much it's changed security wise since --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- all that happened.
R:  [NOISE] Well, I definitely, um -- I know as far as -- I've flown a couple a times since, um, September eleventh and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- know that it [NOISE] definitely -- like, the wait was a lot longer for check in.  It was, like, a --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- two hour wait and --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Oh, it was incredible. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh.
R:  So, um -- but, like you said, I d- -- I don't know that that deters someone who is super d- -- you know --
L:  Has --
R:  -- determined to --
L:  Yes.
R:  Right.
L:  Right.
R:  So --
L:  You know, I mean, the guy with the stuff in his shoes and, [NOISE] you know, the explosives in the heels of his shoes or whatever.  I mean, do they --
R:  Right.
L:  Would they pick that up?  Walking -- just walking through a metal detector?  Obviously they didn't.
R:  Right.
L:  Because he got on the plane with them.
R:  Right.
L:  So -- but I know now they're saying -- I mean, I had a friend whose husband flew and he brought nail clippers and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- a- -- not thinking nothing.  You know, it wasn't like he was gonna go and clip everybody on the plane or anything but he just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- had it in his bag.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, ah, they did stop him because they saw it, I guess, when his bag went through the, you know -- down the belt, whatever --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, through the x-ray machine.  They did see it and they did stop him and, like, questioned him --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- ridiculously and he's, like, "You know, hey, [LAUGH] it's just nail clippers.  Take 'em".  You know?  But --
R:  Yeah.  And then -- right.
L:  So, I guess they're --
R:  And then it seems the people that have the dangerous stuff are fly- --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, getting right through.  S- -- [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well, I know my, um, ah, sister -- not my sister, my girlfriend's brother just came back from the Cayman Islands on his honeymoon --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and he brought cigarettes home and that's illegal.  They're not supposed to be able to bring cigarettes, you know, from there.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But he was on a plane and he just wrapped them in his suitcase.
R:  Wow.
L:  So, now, I don't know -- I don't know what -- I mean, I know the carry ons they -- they run through that belt but what do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they do with the suitcases?  Do they run --
R:  You know, I --
L:  -- that through and, kind of, x-ray --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- machine or anything?  'Cause, you know, you h- -- check those in and --
R:  Right.
L:  It's, like, they tag 'em, put 'em on a belt and -- and you see 'em loaded into the plane but does it go into -- does that go in through any, kind of, search?  I don't know.
R:  You know, I --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know either.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess they suppose that if the luggage is separated from the people that, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- would they be able to detonate or -- or whatever it's called to ignite something?  You kn- -- I --
L:  Well, sure but couldn't they though?  I mean, b- -- come on, if you had a ticking bomb in there, couldn't they --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just push a button and [MN] -- I don't know.
R:  Have a little remote or something? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, yeah.  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, there's so much with technology nowadays, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you could do -- cr- -- oh, you got some little ones at home, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, the husband's giving the bath and I'm --
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.  We did r- -- have guests over so it's very funny that they -- they always call at the strange times.  But -- anyway ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I've never done one before so ...
R:  Oh, you haven't?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.
L:  No.  I'm never -- I must have put down the wrong times to call because whenever they call, I'm never here.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  So, um -- but I'm planning on flying, ah, the end of o- -- beginning of August.  I'm gonna --
R:  Ok- --
L:  -- fly home.  We're going to --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Florida.  So --
R:  Oh, good.
L:  So, I will no more then about how they --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the search thing is going but --
R:  [NOISE] Well, I do know that they, um, changed the, you know, heightens of al- -- of alertness.  'Cause I'm about forty five minutes from, um, you know, the Atlanta Airport. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um -- yeah.  So, I guess we live in the same vicinity.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and I do know that, like, certain times there is, like, or- -- you know, the -- the heightened they, like, have colors and I guess on those days, you know, maybe you have to check in earlier and --
L:  Yeah.  That could be.
R:  -- so forth.
L:  But it's almost like you don't know what you can take in a bag anymore.
R:  [LAUGH] That's the truth.
L:  You know, you can't take nail clippers.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can't take a nail file and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's almost like, you know, I mean, I -- I'm almost afraid to even take luggage.  I told my parents, I said, "You know, I'll fly home and you just drive my luggage home" because --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- I don't wanna have something in there, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that I'm not supposed to have --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and get, like, detained for three hours and questioning because I put a stupid nail clipper in my bag.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, I don't know.  You know, I mean, eyelash curlers?  I mean, are those --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- weapons?  I [LAUGH] -- I don't know.
R:  Right.  And anything that's metal --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know how they determine what is and what isn't.  I mean, I can't imagine --
R:  No.
L:  -- you could do --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- much damage with nail clippers but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  You would think that but then, you know, with the box cutter thing, it's like --
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, I don't know who thought of that.  I mean, that's just, kind of, like -- I don't know.  I -- to me, that would be, like, "Well, why would someone be carrying that on a plane?"
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean --
L:  Exactly.
R:  I --
L:  Nail clippers, okay.  Nail file, okay.  But a box cutter?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  That's really, like, I -- I don't know.  That --
L:  It's just asking for it. [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  That's, like, a -- a -- just something in my mind goes off the -- you know, well, what does this person need that for if you're, you know --
L:  M- --
R:  -- obviously not doing any kind of construction or --
L:  No.
R:  -- you know, on a plane?  So --
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know.  So, I -- I mean, it would be, kind of, interesting to get a list of what you are allowed and not allowed to take on anymore because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  Why, that[?] the internet would be a good pla- -- [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Maybe.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe it would 'cause --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I -- I just -- I'm -- I'm almost afraid to.  You know --
R:  To fly?  Yeah.
L:  I'm afraid to fly anyhow. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  Just because a- -- but I've almost been, a- -- kind of, afraid to fly.  That whole concept just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Being that high and confined and --
R:  Right.
L:  I can fly to Florida.  That's about as far as I can go -- two hours or two and a half hours from here but --
R:  Is that, like, South Florida?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like, Fort Myers and that area.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  Yeah.  So --
R:  I have family in Fort Lauderdale so -- yeah.
L:  Oh.  Okay.
R:  Not too far from there.
L:  Yeah.  My parents have a condo in -- in Venice so --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- we go -- we go down --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- there a lot in the summer.  It's free lodging. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, hey, that's the best kind.
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  We can't afford to go to Florida without the free lodging.
R:  Oh, I know that.  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  So -- so -- yeah.  So, I -- I will be flying for the first time and, ah --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- in a couple of years so I'm, kind of -- I'm almost afraid. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I -- I don't know.  I -- I guess, to me, like the heightened security did give me a little more comfort.  Like, okay, well, you know, at least they're trying to do something about it.  So, um --
L:  But I don't know that they're checking everyone.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's what I don't understand is how they pick and choose who --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're gonna check --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and who they're not, you know?  Because --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  [MN] But I guess little old --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- ladies can m- -- may be terrorists in hiding.  You know, I mean --
R:  Absolu- --
L:  I don't know.
R:  I think anybody real- -- I mean, you know, look at [NOISE] different criminals through -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just throughout the, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ti- -- over time, you know?  Who's been a bank robber and, you know, just -- so, you're, like, "Wow". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Right.  Exactly.
R:  You know? [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  So, I don't know.  I just -- I don't see where it's made that big of a difference.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know though.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just --
R:  And, you know, too with the -- the funny thing is, like, when they indicate the dates, like, "Okay, well we think someone might attack on these dates".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Is that a deterrent or -- I don't [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that made up?  I don't [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  See, I don't get that either.  You know, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- if they have that much information [MN] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they should be able to prevent it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- from even --
R:  Right.
L:  -- happening, you know?  If they know where they're gonna hit and when, a- -- hello?  You know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- if you know that much ...
R:  Well, I wonder w- -- about, um, all the talk of, you know, them knowing that this was supposed to happen or something?  I don't know if that's --
L:  They're -- yeah.  That's what they're saying but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- --
R:  I'm wondering how much of that is true or, you know --
L:  And I don't know -- I don't know what -- I mean, I guess, on the one plane, they had -- someone had a box cutter they'd brought on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  One of the terrorists.
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  But I don't know what else -- I mean, obviously, a- --
