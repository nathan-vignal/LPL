L:  Hi, I'm Helen.
R:  Hi, I'm Robert.
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  I guess we're supposed to talk about strikes.
R:  Um, I think it's um, um, did we agree with um -- how do we feel about, um -- um, athletes getting paid so much money, right?
L:  They are grossly overpaid and they have no right to strike.  That is my opinion.
R:  Oh.  Um --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- I don't think they're overpaid.  I think, um, you know, um, sports is a business.  I feel that they help bring in the crowds.  People come to see these particular players play and, um, if they are not getting a large percentage of the money then the owners of the club's getting all the money, and I don't think that would be um, right either.  So being that the fans are paying to come see the players, I think it's only fair.  And a lot of the players, as far as basketball is concerned, um, football is concerned, a lot of sports take a lot of injuries.  Like Patrick Ewen, right now his knees are no good.  His ankles are in bad shape, you know, 'cause he's like, seven feet tall and when he falls to the ground, um, he hits pretty hard, you know, so a lot of these guys --
L:  Do you really think somebody's worth twelve million dollars a year?
R:  Um, I think if --
L:  You really do?
R:  I think if they bring in fifty million they're worth twelve.
L:  See I -- I don't agree with you.  And --
R:  Um, wait a minute, what about -- what about Tom Cruise? Do you think --
L:  He is not worth -- no, he's grossly overpaid too.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I think he's grossly overpaid too.  See, I'm from -- from a working class family and we used to go see the Philly's.  My -- my husband had season tickets to the Eagles.  We went to every home game of the Philly's, we haven't been in two years and he gave up his season's tickets this year.  Because it's ridiculous how much to pay these people, they're overcharging the fans.  And then they go on strike at a whim, whenev- -- whenever they feel like it, they go on strike.  And I just think the whole -- the whole professional sports thing has to be redone.  I think it's horrible, the way they treat the fans, and the strikes -- the strikes do it.  That last strike in baseball just about killed it.
R:  Uh-huh.  You know, it's interesting to listen to a female's opinion about sports, you know, because when I speak to guys, usually guys don't feel that way --
L:  Well maybe it's because it's the women that take care of the money.  You know, we take care of the money and I see where it -- and I'm like, oh please, you know what I could do with twelve million dollars?  You know what I could do with twelve -- twelve hundred dollars?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they're -- and they're fighting.  They fighting over -- over millions.  They're fighting over millions.
R:  Well, look at this.  Look at this.  Right now, just like you say, you are the working class, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And um, and this country, right now they talk about cutting jobs and raising taxes and raising the fee on the subway, this, that and the other, in the mean time they could go over there and bomb um, Iraq over there with these missiles that cost a million dollars and um -- and they said well --
L:  Yeah but we're -- but we're talking about striking in -- in sports.
R:  Yeah, which -- which -- which I --
L:  I don't know if we get paid if we go off the subject that bad.
R:  Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  N- -- no, it's not going off the subject, it's making a point.
L:  Okay.  Go ahead.
R:  Making a point, see.  And they spend billions on top of billions, now he's over there and he's trying to rebuild the country over there and now they're over there building South Africa.  What I am saying is this country has -- they have so much money.  It's -- you know, we can't even s- -- imagine the money that they have.  It's incredible.
L:  The money that they waste.
R:  The money that they waste.
L:  That they waste, much less that they have.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH] see, so now --
L:  We could live on what they waste.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, the same with professional sports.
R:  Well this is what -- this is what I'm saying.  If so much money that's going around, see, and if now a regular person can go to school and maybe get a -- a football or basketball or baseball scholarship or something like that, and be able to get up into that money because how else are you going to get that money unless you become a movie star or something like that?
L:  But why does somebody need forty four million dollars? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well --
L:  Nobody needs forty four million dollars.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Nobody does.  Nobody needs to live in a house with four pools and three tennis courts.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I certainly don't need to pay for it.  I'm not saying that the players should make less so the owners make more.  I'm saying the players should make less and the owners should make less so the fans don't pay as much.  Like right now in Philadelphia, I don't know where you're from, but by whole basis is based on the Philadelphia area.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And right now --
R:  I'm in New York.
L:  Oh, well, close enough.  See, I'm a Giants fan, my husband's an Eagles fan.  But -- se we have fun at football season.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But um, but they're building a new football stadium and new baseball stadium, that's fine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- except for them making the taxpayers pay for it.  But the revenues, where do the revenues go?  Right into the owner's pocket.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it drives me insane.  They just raised the -- the um, the season's pass tickets so high that my husband gave up his tickets.  He's had 'em for ten years.
R:  Yeah --
L:  And he gave 'em up.
R:  You heard about Jason Kidd in um, New Jersey?  He's getting ninety nine million dollars. [LAUGH] 
L:  The whole state of New Jersey isn't worth ninety nine million dollars.
R:  [LAUGH] Wait a minute now --
L:  I live smack dab in the middle --
R:  -- that ain't nothing --
L:  -- I live smack dab in the middle of Jersey. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well, they're going to pay him ninety nine million.  I don't know for how many years, you know, it usually goes about --
L:  It better be into his great grandchildren.
R:  Well --
L:  'Cause it's coming out of my tax dollars --
R:  And then they have --
L:  -- see that's what I mean, you don't think that's insane?  Ninety nine million dollars!  There is not a person in this world worth ninety nine million dollars, and Tom Cruise is not worth fourteen million dollars a movie.
R:  Oh yes, now, you know I'm over here in New York, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now they had a big deficit.  Now this man here is a billionaire.  You know, he took his own money and put it in so he wouldn't have to close certain things, but he's going to get it back from New York from the tax payers and different stuff like that there.
L:  Oh definitely, they always get it back.
R:  He invested -- he invested his own money.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Into New York.  You see what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I'm telling you that there are people like the Kennedy's, the Rockefeller's, the Dupont's, the super rich --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they have that kind of money.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  See, they have that kind of money.  Um, we -- we -- we've never seen that kind of money, and um, you know, um, I might be able to count to a million, I might be able to count to a billion, I might be able to count to a trillion --
L:  You'd fall asleep before you counted that high.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  You would.
R:  This is what I'm try- -- this is what I'm trying to tell you.
L:  But I don't understand, why people need that much money.
R:  Phew.
L:  I don't.
R:  Well the only thing I can say is, security.  See, it's security.
L:  Yeah, but how come we can be secure making fifty thousand dollars a year?  And we have security and we pay taxes.
R:  Well guess what.  With fifty thousand dollars a year, we are not secure.
L:  Well, that's how much --
R:  See, because if we needed a special heart transplant and um, special doctors from Switzerland and --
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  -- all of this -- all this stuff and we don't -- we don't want a doctor --
L:  Yeah, but why should we pay for their safety net?
R:  -- we would want -- we would want a medical team --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you see what I'm saying?  So this could be your mother, your brother, your -- this could be your child, your son or your daughter.  You understand?  And in order to save their life, you need this professional medical opinion from different parts of the country --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- different parts of the world, and to hire these top notch professionals, it may cost you a billion dollars --
L:  Well it's too late for me to be -- it's too late for me to be a basketball player for the Mets.
R:  Yeah, well I'm just saying, that's why a person might need the money, you understand?
L:  Oh yeah, well, I might too.
R:  I mean, to save a love -- to save somebody that you really love and you care about, see, it would be worth a billion dollars to me.
L:  Well of course, that's -- that's just a ridiculous point --
R:  In -- in that sense -- yeah.
L:  -- because of course it is.  It's worth every penny in the world.
R:  See, I think -- yeah, I think, I mean, school teachers deserve a lot more money, you know.  I believe --
L:  Right, but they shouldn't go on strike as much as they do either.
R:  Well --
L:  And my sister's a school teacher in Jersey.
R:  Well they are grossly underpaid.  They are grossly underpaid and mistreated.  And those teachers take a lot of abuse in those classrooms from those kids.  Today the kids are cursing and beating up their own mothers and fathers and, oh man, it's really bad.  I had this um, I just -- I don't want to get into, like you say, get off the topic --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, but, I believe they're grossly underpaid.  Um, and these sports figures are getting all this money --
L:  Yeah they are, and they go on strike.  They -- they have the audacity to go on strike.
R:  Well like, see, you might look at it as a sport.  It's not a sport.
L:  See, but it is a sport.  And that's where they gotta get back to
R:  It's not a sport.
L:  Yes it is.  It's not a business.  It never was supposed to be a business.  They're entertainers.  It -- it -- it's a -- it's -- it's sports.  It's not a business.
R:  Watch this.  With them, from their point of view --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a way of life.  See, it's a way of life, they're paying bills, they're paying mortgages, they're sending their kids to college
