L:  Sofia.
R:  Hello, I'm  Sherry.
L:  Oh, okay, hey.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  New York.  You?
R:  New York? Oh. Indiana.
L:  Wow.
R:  Hi?
L:  What -- what did they say the topic was?  I didn't hear her.
R:  I didn't quite hear it, something about how, -- if we -- ah, I didn't hear it all, but if we thought the problem over in the Middle East would ever be resolved.  If we thought --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- the problems, I guess, the war with, ah, bin Laden, and --
L:  Oh, okay, okay.
R:  -- the other guy, what's the other guy's name?
L:  Um, Sa- Saddam?  Yeah.
R:  Saddam?  Yeah. Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay, 'cause I'm, like, what did the lady say [inaudible] --
R:  They -- they go so fast, and it's so quiet, you can barely hear, but --
L:  I know, I, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, ah, what do you think?
R:  Well, I don't know, I think it'll calm down for a little while, but I think, if they don't capture those two, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or do something, I don't think it'll ever quit.
L:  Wow.
R:  I just think it'll keep on, I don't think, you know, they might quit for a little while, and then, they'll come back s- -- you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- stronger, and do worse stuff to us, I think, unless they get them and put them in jail.
L:  Sure, well, who are we?  We're the ones who gave them the weapons, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm, like, the only way we could really stop them is [inaudible] how to mind our business, because, we can't take care of things in backyard and don't know what even going in our yard.
R:  Right.
L:  Look how homeless we are, and we're over here forking out two billion dollars for these planes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm, like, those things, that could have been, that money you spent on them planes, you could have really put it into some of this housing, and you don't have to, you know, it's [inaudible] deficient in New York City -- hello?
R:  I'm -- yeah, I'm still here.
L:  Oh, -- oh, and, like, you probably read the thing in New York City about how we're broke, and all of this, but, you know, broke to build a one billion dollar plane, --
R:  Right.
L:  --  because, like, I'm like, I'm, like, stop BSing me, I got money, yeah, frightened about what's going on, CNN only let us know what we want to know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so everything can keep calm, because, to me, when it was going on, everybody's sort of pulling out these sort of reality shows, and, like, how are you pulling out all these reality shows, when you're not even letting us know what's really going on where we're at right now?
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, I'm like, it's disgusting.  It's really just how it is.
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's -- it's just kind of, I th- -- y- y- you know, I can understand that there's children over there, I have four kids myself, but you know, when they started bombing and all this, and they were trying to get all the people to be on the US side, and give up all the Taliban, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- other -- other people, they were trying, you know, trying to get all the Iraqs on our side, and all that, or, you know, --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- at least for them to work with us a little bit, maybe to show them that the US ain't so bad, they sent all that --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- food over there, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and what about all the homeless people in, you know, all the people that's here living in poverty, and --
L:  I know, [MN] they don't care.
R:  You know, they're US citizens.
L:  I know, right, if they get mad if we over here stealing, but, look who's stealing from whose backyard.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, like, how are you going to get mad.  I think it's disgusting how we are quick to point fingers of who's doing wrong to us, when since day one, since, um, A- Americans came here, and [inaudible] told each other we were Americans, look who did wrong, we stole before [MN] anybody else stole from us.
R:  Well.
L:  I'm, like, it's, like, it's disgusting, I hope it stops but I doubt it'd stop because the only way it will stop, to me, it will calm down if we mind our business, and pay more attention to what we got going on here, --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  -- and stop putting so much rule and regulations on us.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  -- and it's just like, you know, when they -- they said that we taught those, we -- that some of those people that stole the planes that day, that hijacked the planes, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they were enrolled in air school, here in the United States, in Florida --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, now, like, w- why would, you know, I know [MN] it's a free country and all that, and people come over here because of the freedom and everything, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, those people, I think, they came over here to gather any information that they could gather to use against us, and they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- learnt how to -- they learnt how to fly, and, you know, all that stuff, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then, part of those people hijacked those planes.
L:  That's true, true, but then, it's like, look what we did to them, you know, I'm like, you, to them, -- we look like we're doing more wrong, whatever, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- having, ah, the women out like that, and then, it's, like, then, how you treat your women over there, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then, okay, we won't even allow a gay couple, so how are we going to over here discriminate on them how they treat women, and we don't even treat people who want to get married the same way, you know, we treat them the same way, --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or we treat bi racial couples the same way, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like, you can't really point fingers of who's doing wrong when we do wrong more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's, like, to me, Bush is wrong, Mayor Bloomberg is wrong, everybody who's in the White House right now is wrong, but, you know, --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- all I can do is complain, say what I feel, and they still got the right hand.
R:  Yeah, I know a lot of people that, um, my best -- one of our best friends' son had to go over there, you know, to fight in the war, and he was just going over there to guard a airport, and then it turns out that they put him right out on the ground fighting, and -- you know, I didn't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it -- it -- the things -- it didn't quite bother me, 'cause, I, it was, you know, it's over there, I was worried about what would happen with my kids, but, you know, it's over there, I'm not, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I didn't think a lot would happen to us here, and we kind of live in a small town, you know, --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- not by any major city, that they would think about attacking, like Chicago, or, you know, like, New York, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they want to do a lot of damage to us, I think, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they would probably attack the big places, but you know, we live in a small town, and everything, and I'm kind of --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- thankful for -- for that.  But --
L:  Because they -- yeah, if they were to live, you know, in your neighborhood --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you would have been, they would have been already noticeable.
R:  All those, yeah, all those people that, you know, that -- that there was that day, there was a lot of innocent people, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, fathers, there was a lot of -- a lot of women on the talk shows that were pregnant that lost their husbands that day.  That's pretty bad.
L:  Yeah, and that's the thing I don't like about society, too, is how they have women stay at home a lot 'cause when, they have, so, you know, the -- the women that were pregnant, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- with their husbands, and they're, like, I'm a stay at home mom, and I'm, like, y- you should have a education yourself, you know, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I'm, like, 'cause you -- you all -- you have a Plan A and I bet you they didn't even think about Plan B, C, or D, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then, this time of life, you have to plan on those, look how many people are having affairs or getting divorced, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as far as them to have so many kids, I'm, like, you have so many kids, and only depending on one salary?  I'm, like, that's sad, you all, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- even though he does make a lot of money, that's really sad, because, what have you got now?
R:  Right.
L:  -- when that money is gone?  You have to start back school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you can't say, oh, my kids this, and kids that.  New York City, we have, at our colleges, we have day care, so, you can't say you can't find a day care, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and it's just -- I don't know, it's just sad how society really [inaudible] us and want us to label ourselves Americans, and behind American, [MN] there's a lot of bad things, you know?  'Cause a lot of people, like, it's a beautiful place to visit, but it's not a beautiful place to live, when you really get down.
R:  Yeah, I know, behind all the, all the, um, --
L:  T shirts, yeah, --
R:  -- smoke, there's -- yeah.
L:  -- you know, those advertisements, oh, look at beautiful America, we love each other, I think New York, people some of them have got grimy, even they say some got nice, I think some of them still got grimier, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, you people are a little meaner than before, and it's because they're stressed out, because Bloomberg want to raise this, want to raise that, want to raise this, I mean, like, how you raising all these things, if people losing their jobs left and right, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it makes no sense, you know, so, war, it's never going to stop, and it's sad how they come to my school, they come to my college, and they're, like, trying to recruit us! I'm, like, you don't need to come for us, you need to go grab Bush and his family, because this guy want to cause trouble, you ring them, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not us, we don't want to cause trouble.  I'm, like, bring the people who want to fight out there, don't bring people who need money for college out there.  That's not right, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because if you don't make America, where's that money going?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Okay, I've gone through education, so, I'm, like, when they come around with that sticker, something like "Join the Army!", I'm, like, you need to hand that to Bush, you really need to hand that to him.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm kind of glad that it kind of -- you know, kind of settled down and ended a little bit, I guess.  They let some of the troops come home, I'm glad that --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- they did that and didn't, you know, 'cause I heard, too, that th- -- we were thinking about bringing the draft back, if more people had to go over there, if it got really bad and really ugly, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm thankful for that, you know, 'cause there's a lot of people who don't want to be drafted, that, you know, [MN] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- parents worrying about kids and everything, I mean, if you want to join the service and you want to risk your life, then, I guess, that's your choice, but, then, you know, if you're not really interested , and don't want to go fight, and all that crap, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think you sh- -- they should make you have to do that.
L:  But then, you got those recruiters who brainwash you, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- who throw that money in your face, saying, you can get ten thousand if you -- you invest.
R:  They spend, yeah, they spend -- uh, my kids -- my two kids are in high school, they spent almost the whole senior year with the seniors up there, trying to talk them into joining, they --
L:  You see, and -- mhm.
R:  -- even -- they even had, like, a -- a little obstacle thing set up, to show 'em the training that they --
L:  Ah!
R:  -- you know, kind of their -- their basic boot camp training, I guess, what it is, [MN] to show 'em what kind of stuff their boot camp would be like, and all this.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And you know, my husband was in the army, and he said, it ain't nothing like TV says, it ain't like that, it's -- it's bad.  [LAUGH]
L:  It is!
R:  It's, they -- they yell at you, and they make you pass all these o- obstacle courses, and you got to run five miles a day, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it ain't nothing like what they show on TV, the army being all a great place, [LAUGH] 'cause it's not.
L:  It isn't.  You know, because you're in a little cubicle, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- not even a little cubicle.  Not little, surrounded by so many people.  And then, how are you supposed to feel comf-
