R:  Hi, I'm Tammy.
L:  Hi, I'm Brian.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too.
R:  Interesting topic tonight.
L:  Yes, um, wages, ah, salaries for professional athletes.  Is that it?
R:  Yes, and if we think they're -- I think if we think they're justified in striking and stuff like that.
L:  Okay.  So how about you start?
R:  Okay.  Not a problem.  Um, I think for the amount of money that they make [LAUGH] which I think is ridiculous, um, I love sports though.  I'm a huge sports fan but I just think they're way overpriced.  There are people that do more important jobs, you know, than other than a form of entertainment that should get higher wages.
L:  Yes.  Yes, I'm -- I definitely agree.  Um, I guess in our society anything that makes a lot of money will pay a lot of money, so I guess that's why they're paid so much money.  It's because it generates so much, but I don't think -- I don't think it's right at all.  Um --
R:  Exactly --
L:  -- yes --
R:  -- teachers, you know. [LAUGH] Teachers that are shaping the future, you know, they -- they deserve a little more money than they're getting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and another -- I guess my biggest thing is accountability.  When we're having, you know, issues with Toby Bryant, you know, this league his, you know, sexual assault impending charges and Daryl Armstrong in Orlando getting busted, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then turning around and teaching a camp, you know, four hours after he gets out of jail, for youth. [LAUGH] Like, I just have huge issues with that type of role model.
L:  Yeah, I -- I agree.  Now, if I were -- if say I were an English teacher in New York state and someone suspected that, or I even went to court for it, chances are I would never work in New York state ever again.
R:  Oh, yeah.  You know I hadn't even thought of that.  Yes, definitely guilty until proven innocent thing, and their reputations are a little tarnished but they can -- they still have all that money to buy themselves lawyers and get themselves out of, you know, things that they're doing there.  So 
L:  Yeah.  Um --
R:  I'm sorry, I've got a little one with a back injury from swimming. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.
R:  Too much swimming, speaking of athletes. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yes.
R:  All that good stuff.  Um, this striking, I think that was the worst thing baseball ever did.  I was not a huge baseball fan to begin with, but to see them all, you know, doing the walk outs and stuff, that's just nutty.
L:  Yeah.  That's just nutty, greedy, um, and crazy.  I don't know how someone who is making enough for their entire family, grandkids[?] and friends, how -- how some could actually -- I don't know, I don't understand that at all, how someone could have the audacity to strike when they're making crazy amounts of money.
R:  Exactly.  And what about that, ah, eighteen year old that's going to be playing for Cleveland that's, what, a ninety million dollar contract just from Nike and he hasn't even played a game?
L:  Oh, LeBron James.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yes.  Yeah, I read a [several inaudible words] I guess his, um -- yeah, that -- I mean in some -- in some ways I think sports in -- for African Americans and for minorities, I think um, the entertainment industry really is a -- a -- an outlet because, you know, as you know, pretty much white -- white people, for the most part, are the most powerful and wealthiest people in the country.
R:  Yes.
L:  So in -- in a sense that it's kind of bringing people literally out of the ghettos --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that's a great thing.  But, I'm not sure what other benefit comes from it.  I mean [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, too much, too fast.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, that's just -- I mean I think of an eighteen year old kid with that kind of money who hasn't even really proven himself beyond, you know, high school [LAUGH] and -- and what they're losing in not being able to go to college and develop some maturity and just the life skills that you learn.  You know, you're taking him right out of mom and dad's house into -- into a whole world that probably has a lot more than even we dare to even want to know.  And it's -- to me it's a form of exploitation, but, you know, when I think of how much m- -- movie stars are making and we look at sports as an entertainment value, you know, I guess what they spend on a whole team in a season's the equivalent of what it costs to make a movie.  But it's just -- you know, there's so many more strings attached to what these athletes are doing and promoting, and you know, kids and stuff, than what they -- the movie star affect is, I think.  But I just -- when they strike it just makes me not want to watch that sport any more.
L:  Are they -- are they striking now?
R:  No, I don't think so.
L:  Oh, that was like, a couple of years ago?
R:  Yeah. [several inaudible words] NFL -- I love football.  I said to my kids, if they do that again. [LAUGH] I only remember one and I'm hoping that they've learned from the others. [LAUGH] I'm just like, don't, don't mess with my football.  Hopefully those guys'll know better.
L:  What state are you from?
R:  Ah, originally from the West but now we're in Florida.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So -- yeah.
L:  So football is pretty big there?
R:  Oh, well, I don't know, it's just always the one I like. [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, die-hard Seahawk fan.  You know, go for the loser. [LAUGH] That -- that's my team.  But baseball, I don't know, that was more my family, my -- all my brothers played and stuff like that, but I just was disgusted by their attitudes and all their striking all the time and so it was like, okay [LAUGH] can't be a baseball fan.
L:  So is their -- was their strike solely based on wanting more money?
R:  You know, I honestly have no clue.
L:  If it was, then I think they should all be fired and replaced whoever really was striking.
R:  Exactly.
L:  I don't think these people are -- are -- are grateful or appreciative or even understand what their financial situation is compared to ninety nine percent of the world, you know.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  And they get catered to and all the world revolves around 'em and they get upset when something goes wrong.  But my husband wonders how they, you know, you get -- I don't know how many major league baseball teams there are, but you know, what starts the ball rolling, you know?  And one little thing, who -- who has the power to get that many people together?  Because I mean, that's got to be a massive amount of people, and he wonders who spearheads it and starts that little small voice going in the back, "You deserve more.  You deserve more", you know.  And then event- -- eventually it's like pushing a stone up a hill, it's going to fall down the other side --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm wondering who has the power?  Where does that come from?
L:  Yeah, that's a good question.  Um --
R:  Because I have no clue.
L:  I'm not sure either, pro- -- well my only guess, see -- I -- I -- I -- I don't know about a conspiracy, but okay, when things -- when things um, change or something happens and it's made public with any -- any industry or anything, even if it's supposedly, um, for example the strike, people are almost interested, maybe even more than before, maybe mad but paying attention more to baseball.  Well at least in my case, I was almost excited and a bit more entertained[?] for a minute when I found out people were striking.  It annoyed me but it kind of --
R:  Got your attention.
L:  Yeah, grab your attention and then get you even more excited when everything's settled and -- so who knows who's behind it?  Um, if it's -- even the players themselves, they entice the players, someone actually saying, well this'll be good for the whole industry if you guys, you know, groan about --
R:  Yeah, I never thought --
L:  -- you know, how much you're making or strike, somehow get the ratings up.  Who knows?
R:  Yeah, exactly.  Then if they found out later they were just being used. [LAUGH] Pawns for publicity and the money was a great side benefit, but -- man --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't know.  I just -- I -- I'm just stunned by the amounts for even just the -- I heard that like, even the scab players on football teams, you know, league minimums are like sixty to seventy five thousand a year.
L:  Minimum.
R:  Yeah.  And there's, you know, upwards in the millions and, you know, then I see, you know, players like Carl Malone took a one million dollar pay cut to go to the Lakers or whatever he's doing, he gave up whatever, you know, and -- because he just really wants a championship now.  He's, you know, given up on the money end, so --
L:  Oh yeah.  I'm sure he has.
R:  -- you know, all his millions that he has. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  It doesn't exactly make a huge difference.
R:  Seems like -- but he can afford to lose a few million and try and get a ring, I guess. [LAUGH] But basketball struck a couple of years ago, didn't they?  Weren't they locked out or something?  By the --
L:  What happened?  Basketball?
R:  Yeah, except for theirs -- they called it a lockout, so I was wondering was that something, I think where the owners locked them out because of some reason.  The players wanted to play
