L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, I'm Maureen.
L:  I'm Mark.
R:  Hi Mark.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine, thanks.  Where --
L:  Good.  Where -- where are you?
R:  I'm in Lancing, Michigan.
L:  Lancing, Michigan.  I'm in Brooklyn, New York.
R:  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I almost debated whether I would choose this topic to talk about because I really don't know much about sports.  I don't follow it.
L:  This is actually the second time today that they've called me and this has been the topic.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  Is this your first ca- -- first time participating?
L:  It is, but I'm -- it's the second call, but I just signed up, like, this morning.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, well this is the second call I've, um, participated in, so the last one I talked about was much easier, it was dogs. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, that is easier.  Yeah, this one's a little bit like, there's not all that much to say, but we need -- I think -- do we need to talk about it for a certain amount of time?
R:  You do.  I think you have to talk about it for like, eight minutes, or so.
L:  Eight of the ten.  Okay.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  The only thing that I guess um, when they talked -- when they mentioned something about do you deserve the high salaries they get, um, I don't know, I think it's like any other person that's good in their field, whether it's a musician or an athlete.  You know, they are high but they're also, um, not always in that area for a long period of time too, so 
L:  Well, and also -- it's -- it's like if the -- the demand is there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and so those organizations make a lot of money so that they -- so then they -- it's like, you know, they're their employees essentially, so you mean you'd want people's employees to get paid -- to be paid as much as, you know, they can.
R:  Mhm.  Well --
L:  To --
R:  -- and like you said, they -- they are the people that bring in the dollars for the -- for the owners, so --
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then there's the other side of the coin which is two -- two things that I thought of before, [COUGH] in my previous conversation about this, which was, one -- one is that um, like, the ticket prices to go see those types of events are so high --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you'd think like, a lot of like, normal, sort of, like, middle to low income people in the country can't really afford to go to those types of events, like, to see like, the Mets play, or to see the Celtics play, or to see the ah, the Pistons play, you know what I mean?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, like, you know, does that -- it's sort of like, um, becomes ah, economically inaccessible to like, a certain class of -- of income.
R:  That's true.
L:  So, and if they didn't, you know, 'cause nobody, I mean, in fact nobody really needs to make like, thirty million dollars a year like some of them do, and if they lowered their salaries you'd think that they'd be saving money so they could actually lower the ticket price and make it accessible for people to actually go see the games and, you know.
R:  Well, you bring up a good point too, because what's happening -- what's going to happen in the future if, you know, if sports were built like baseball, um, you know, the interest in sports is built when kids are young and if they can't -- if their parents can't afford to take 'em, at what -- at what point will that die out?  Or like you say, just be an elite class of people that can afford to go --
L:  That can do it, yeah.
R:  -- although do you think the, um, resurgence of the -- we just built a new stadium a couple of years ago for --
L:  The Tigers, right?
R:  -- no, ah, this is Lancing.  That's Detroit.
L:  Oh, right.  Okay.
R:  Right, but I know what you're saying, but it's the um, it's the baseball that's not the major leagues.  What do you call that?  Mi- -- not minor league --
L:  Minor -- minor leagues.
R:  I -- I forget what class it is, but that's geared, um, you know, really towards not inexpensive but relative to, you know, major leagues for family type, um, events, so do you think that's kind of driving -- those high ticket prices are driving other league's popularity because they are affordable?
L:  I guess so, but when you like, if you watch the news or ESPN or something like that, they don't really talk about the minor leagues, and like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the -- the main players and the baseball cards and the, you know, basketball cards and all that stuff, you always hear about the major league players.  So that's sort of like, I feel like -- like, if kids have idols and they want to be athletes or they, you know, and they love the game and stuff like, it's really like the -- the professional, you know, like the major leagues in baseball, NBA and basketball, you know th- -- the national football league or whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- like, that's what people really want to see, and I feel like it's -- it -- you know, it's sort of -- it's like, almost like a substitute, you know, you can go see a game of baseball and maybe love the game but it's like you don't really have a relationship with those players.
R:  Mhm.
L:  As much as you do in the major leagues.  But at the same time, maybe you can make those relationships because those players are, you know, making so much money and they become like celebrities in a way.
R:  Yeah, and I think that's where the draw comes because you hope to see them move upward and onward so you can follow them later.
L:  That's true.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then my other thought on it was that, and it doesn't just apply to baseball, but -- or -- you know, major league sports, but it does -- I mean, but it definitely is applicable, is that like, I -- I don't know, I'm a pretty liberal person --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think that like, you know, companies and corporations and -- and sports teams that make -- and they make like, exorbitant amounts of money for the -- for the people involved --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, the athletes and the owners and the investors and stuff like that.  But I think that they also sort of have a -- a responsibility to -- if they're going to be making that much money, to like, distribute their wealth more evenly, and not like, because their, you know, their constituency or whatever, are -- are people who are like, you know, not making multi million dollar salaries a year, that like, they -- th- -- those -- those organizations sort of have a responsibility to do like, more philanthropic things with their money.  So let's say like, everybody got, you know, everyone who makes like, five million or more got a -- you know, made a million dollars less, you free up tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year that you can do like, charitable work or you can have the players or the -- the owners do things for the community that they exist in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I think that's important.
R:  I think -- yeah -- I think -- and I think that they -- they -- they put on a show to do that in certain respects when they sponsor things and -- and such, but um, I -- I think our society has gotten to the point where everybody is in it for -- for the money, for the, you know, the -- the high dollar and whether it's sports or whether it's entertainment or whether it's, you know, any company --
L:  Big business -- yeah.
R:  -- business, period, but um, that's kind of been the focus, um, is -- is to make the big dollars, so --
L:  Yeah, and I mean it's -- it's one those things where, I feel like everything in our society -- in terms of economics is related in one sense or another.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so you -- you don't think of something like um, you know, like, you know, this year how many tens of -- or hundreds of thousands of people got laid off because of the bad economy --
R:  Mhm.
L: -- and -- and -- but you have to also realize that like, that -- maybe that has something to do with like, the gluttony of like, the top two or three percent of -- of like, income in this country and -- and you know, they don't want to take the pay cut so they lay off ten or fifteen employees or a hundred or ten thousand or whatever, you know, if it's GM they lay off, you know, an entire plant --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of people and -- and send labor to like, some country where you can pay someone ten cents an hour to do it and you lose all these jobs and it doesn't seem directly related but I feel like the general philosophy behind --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- paying someone thirty million dollars regardless of whether it's to play baseball or -- or build computers or build cars, it doesn't make sense to me.
R:  Mhm.  Well, yeah, I understand what you're saying, I think um, I -- I'm careful in thinking that um, you know, putting caps on things for businesses or for sports players or anything of that nature, because that's what our country was founded on, was um, you know, the entrepreneurship and -- and the -- the search for money and wealth and -- and security and such, so um, have you ever read the books by Ayn Rand?
L:  No.  I mean -- I -- I've -- I've dabbled with the Fountainhead and I've --
R:  Uh-huh.
L: -- read parts of Atlas Shrugged but I know her -- her objectivism and her -- that -- that whole theory of hers --
R:  Yeah, yeah, well it's kind of like that, I -- I'm kind of caught in the middle when I think in terms of -- of that.  But you know, when they talk about um, these players striking for more money, how do you feel about the strike part?
L:  I mean, I guess that's actually the -- it -- it's funny because it's a -- it's a -- it seems like a contradiction in -- in -- in philosophies because I'm all for the ability for someone to strike if they feel like they have a need to -- to like, lobby for -- for more resources or more money or more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I feel like if you are making -- if -- if -- like, you know, most of these leagues have a minimum salary --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so if you play professional baseball you can't make less than --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think for most of them it's in the like, two to five hundred thousand dollars a year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And to me that is enough money to establish security, send your kids to college, retire well and leave your family a little bit of money.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you make three hundred thousand dollars a year for a ten year career, that's a lot of money.  I mean, that's way more than
