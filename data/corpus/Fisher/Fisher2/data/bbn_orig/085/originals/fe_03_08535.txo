L:  Hi, I'm Christina.
R:  Christina?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [SIGH] Ah, I'm Lenna.  It's --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- L.E.N.N.A.  [SIGH] 
L:  Okay, that's --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- a pretty name.
R:  Ah, we're supposed to talk about, um, airport security.
L:  Right, right.  What -- what are -- what are you opinions on it?
R:  Ah, well, I think that they must have it, it's an absolute necessity --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, um, ah, they should, ah, get tougher actually, although it would take longer for the, ah, travelers [SIGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- ah, they -- they really have to do it, and [SIGH] as far as profiling goes, they have to do that, too.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, you know, they have to target the certain ones --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's just too bad [MN], it has to be done.
L:  Right, I -- I'm -- I'm kind of -- of -- of mixed feelings about this.  My father actually works for an airline and, ah, he's a flight attendant --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, I am -- I do agree that definitely, you know, security has gotten a lot tougher and I'm glad it has -- it -- it makes me feel safer and I think it does help, um -- I don't know, you know, 'cause that's the thing is -- the tougher of course air- airport security gets, the longer it does take, you know, [MN] to the -- to the point where, I mean, I -- I don't know, you know, how -- I -- I -- honestly, I just don't know how that would work, I mean, I do agree there should -- i- if there was a way to somehow, you know, kind of speed the process up, but still make it, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- as secure as possible, I -- I agree -- I -- I think that there -- that they should, um, have, you know, air marshalls on each flight because I think that that also is -- is, ah --
R:  Yes, I think they should do that too --
L:  Right, I --
R:  -- I think the pilots have guns now, don't they?
L:  Ah, I'm not sure if they have guns, I know that they're, um -- from what I remember my dad saying, I think there might be some sort of, like, way that, um -- like, nobody can get into the cockpit --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I think that there's a way that they lock it from the inside now, or something -- there's -- there's something with the cockpit door that it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's -- it's a lot more secure than it used to be.
R:  Right, they're stronger doors and all, but, ah --
L:  Right.
R:  -- when -- when the pilots have to be fed, they still have to open those doors at certain times, so --
L:  Right.
R:  -- they're not really a hundred percent secure.
L:  Right, of course, you know, exactly, that's -- that's the thing, so -- I don't know, I mean, it's -- it's [LIPSMACK] -- it's -- it's --
R:  And, when they -- when they do tests and ah, have agents try to get past the security --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [MN] ah, too many times they are actually successful in getting past the security, so, I don't think that the security is tight enough as it stands.
L:  It's -- you know what a lot of it is?  It's not necessarily that it's not tight enough, um, that -- that may be the case, it may need to be a little tighter, but, I've noticed, like, I mean -- it's gotten better, but I still see it, like, when you go through, I -- I -- I'm -- I'm not sure if -- how they do -- 'cause I know that before it used to be just, kind of, separate, you know, ah, just like airport, you know, employees that -- that would do the -- the screening as you would go through the security --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I would notice time and time again that I would go through and yeah, I mean, when you walk through and it beeps, you know, they check you and everything, and now they've gotten a lot more strict about that, you know, they make you take your shoes off, they, you know, do the random --
R:  Right.
L:  -- searches, et cetera, et cetera, but, you know, I -- I remember before they got really tight about it, you know, or tighter anyways, they --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so many times I would go through they wouldn't even be looking at the screen, they would be talking to each other --
R:  Right, they were -- they were not doing a good job in the beginning.
L:  -- they were just doing it very lackadaisically -- they were doing it very, just kind of like -- the -- the least possible effort and that -- that's improved, but it's -- I think still could be improved more, because I think they brought in, like, special sort of, you know, I -- I'm not sure how it was, but they brought in, you know, non airport employees --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- to -- to do the screening.
R:  Oh, yes, I think I did read about that in the paper --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] it was really necessary --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because they were really not well trained, or --
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  -- they're weren't -- 
L:  It's like --
R:  -- they didn't do good.
L:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, if you're not trained -- if you don't know, you know, what you're doing or if you're trying at all, if you're not even putting any effort into your job, I mean, it's no wonder that, you know, people get through there.  It really is no wonder.
R:  And I -- I think -- I think that in the training they can learn a lot from Israel, because Israel has dealt with this problem for very many years, for decades --
L: Uh-huh, right.
R:  -- and, ah, they really could learn a lot from them.
L:  Right, right, and it --
R:  So ...
L:  -- and as far as the profiling, ah, you were talking about -- I don't know about that, because, I mean, I -- I can understand, you know, why -- why it -- it might --
R:  It encroaches on liberties.
L:  Well, it -- the thing -- the thing is, for example, um, one of -- one of my best friends, ah, is -- is from Pakistan, and you know, she -- and -- and -- you know, her family, you know, they -- they have a certain look about them, but, you know, I know that, you know, there's so many different, you know, nations that, you know, the people look the same, but, you know --
R:  I know, I know, you --
L:  -- you know, it's --
R:  -- can't even tell the difference -- you don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- where they're from --
L:  Oh, and --
R:  -- really.
L:  You know, and -- and you risk offending like, you know --
R:  It's so, really tough -- our world has gotten -- 
L:  It is.
R:  -- so insecure.
L:  It is, I mean, you know, [SIGH] I -- I don't know it's -- but, you know, I -- I -- I talk to my friends about this, and we, you know, we talk about stuff like this, and it's, you know, I don't know, the -- I -- I -- 
R:  [MN] They're -- they're doing --
L:  -- I don't understand the mindset of the people that do this, you know, so it's a very difficult situation, because it's not something that I would ever do and I could even imagine doing, and -- and you know --
R:  No, no.
L:  So, it's -- it's a completely different mindset.
R:  They're d- -- they're desperate -- they're d- -- it -- desperate people do desperate things --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's the way it is.
L:  I mean, deep down, they're probably -- they don't show desperation, they show -- they show completely other facets, but I'm sure -- [MN] I -- I agree with you, I mean, desperate and -- I agree with that, you know.
R:  It's a cruelty actually.
L:  Yeah, it's -- but it's just -- and it's not even necessarily the culture, because, I mean, I -- I -- I know -- I know quite a bit, you know, about -- about Islam, and -- and it's -- it's not part of the culture, you know, because I've -- I've spoken with my friends on this topic, and -- and --
R:  Right, right -- they interpret it --
L:  -- you know, it's -- it's -- it's like they're completely different, but --
R:  Their interpretation.
L:  -- it's -- it's -- exactly, they interpret it completely differently, in the complete wrong way, and so, you know, that's -- and that's -- that's the other thing, it's -- it's just, you know, how do you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  I know, it's -- it's just really a tough situation --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that we are dealing with.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And we -- [MN] I think they're doing the best they can and I think they will get better as time goes on, they'll learn more and more --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- through experience.
L:  Exactly, I mean, you know, nothing happens in -- in -- you know, nothing of this magnitude, you know, can happen and be radically improved in such a short period of time, I mean, I think we've been doing fairly well, you know, for the almost two years [several inaudible words] --
R:  Yes, I think so, too, I think that they have taken giant steps.
L:  Right.
R:  So, they're -- they're doing pretty well, and they -- it's just a necessity that, ah, we have to live with.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  So, if it --
L:  You know, and I mean, it -- it -- it -- it is -- it is kind of difficult, you know, I remember -- because I -- I -- the first time I, ah, was on a plane, was about three months after September eleventh --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, I mean, I wasn't afraid, because, you know, luckily, you know, I had my dad, you know, kind of telling me things that they were doing and measures that they were taking, so of course, you know, that made me feel safer and, you know --
R:  Oh, well, I had airplane tickets, ah, for about eleven days later --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I cancelled them --
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  -- I was afraid to go.
L:  Right, well, that's -- I mean, that's understandable, you know, if it's not even a whole two weeks afterwards --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that's understandable, you know, a few months gives it -- [MN] gives it a little chance to kind of, you know, get your bearings, but my dad actually had to, ah, he had to fly, I think two days afterwards --
R:  Oh, that was --
L:  -- yeah, and you know, because the -- the first day or two --
R:  -- scary.
L:  -- you know, they cancelled all the flights, but a coupla days afterwards they -- they -- they started, you know, kind of having flights and his flight was to Europe --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, it was to, I believe Paris, or something, and he told me that the -- on the way -- the flight over there, I mean, and they're big airplanes, I think it was a seven five seven, or, one of those airplanes -- and they're big --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and he was saying that there was only about, maybe, fifteen people or so on the flight there, and on the way back, he said --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there was only about eight people.
R:  Mhm, and the airplanes --
L:  Eight people on this huge plane, and he was telling me like --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- they kinda went over, ah, sort of almost over Manhattan so they could see, and he was saying that this woman, you know, there was like -- she was balling because, you know, she had a -- I don't know if she had lost someone there, or she hadn't seen it yet, because she was American but she had been in -- overseas, and this was her first chance to kind of really see it, and I mean, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of course, and she was -- she was kind of distraught, and I mean, everybody was just, you know ...
R:  Well, I have been afraid to get on an airplane -- I haven't been on one since then.
L:  Oh, really?  See, I mean, I -- I -- I fly, you know, quite often, I -- [MN] you know, at least, you know, a few times, you know, two to three times a year, and -- and -- and I -- I don't feel unsafe, you know, I think that the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- measures that they're taking are good, they -- they -- I think will continue to get better, and I, um, you know, I -- I feel pretty secure, you know, you always wanna kind of, you know, keep your, you know, bearings and you just kind of --
R:  Yes, I -- I think that, ah, [MN] that, ah, your chances are far in your favor of being okay.
L:  Right, right, so, you know, and -- and -- and even, you know, if anything just -- just to let you know it's, you know, it's -- it's getting -- you know, it's getting safer, I think they really are, you know, paying attention to the security, and honestly, I don't think there's -- there's anything to worry about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, other than, you know, the -- the normal kind of occurrences that might happen, but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as terrorism, I think, you know, I -- I really think that they're being careful, and I think that they're, you know, there's probably even some measures that we don't even know about.
R:  I imagine so, and, ah --
L:  You know, so --
R:  -- I think that, ah, the terrorists know this, and they're going to choose a different way next time.
L:  Right, because the thing is -- I remember that was one of the things -- is that right after this happened, it's almost like, you know, they wanted us to kind of falter, and they wanted us ...
