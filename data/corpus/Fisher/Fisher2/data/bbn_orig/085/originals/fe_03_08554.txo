L:  [NOISE] Hello.
R:  Hello, hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Shannon.
R:  Hey, how are you doing?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Pretty good.  My name's Eric.
L:  Hi, Eric.
R:  How are you doing?
L:  Oh, I'm real good.  I was a little surprised to get a call on Saturday afternoon actually.
R:  Oh, really, I thought this was for -- supposed to be for guys only for eighteen and up.
L:  Ah, no.  In fact, ah, from what I understood when I first signed on, they were in desperate need of male subjects.
R:  Oh, oh, boy, oh, oh, that's what they're just looking for?
L:  I --
R:  So girls can do it too then?
L:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
R:  Oh, that I might -- you know what, I was just doing it just because, um, that one day we did it, we, um, I was like [NOISE] had nothing to do and I found like a little flyer on the telephone.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On the pay phone so I just tried it out.  I thought they were just looking for guys only.
L:  Oh, well maybe.  I know I found it, um, on a mystery shopping forum.
R:  A mys- -- oh, okay.
L:  And, um, --
R:  How many times have you called?
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  How many times have you called?
L:  Well, I didn't call, they called me right now.
R:  Oh, no, no, no.
L:  Did you call in?
R:  Yeah, I called in.
L:  Oh, yeah, no, they -- they, ah, you can call in or it can be an automatic --
R:  Callback?
L:  Callback, exactly.
R:  Really?  But is it -- you would do it three times though or --
L:  Well, that's what they say, it's only three times, but, ah, a couple of the people on the forum said that they've gotten up to five or six calls.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How did you -- how did you give 'em your number 'cause I -- I told the lady I was going to call from a pay phone.
L:  Oh, um, well, I -- I did my application on line.
R:  Really?
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, that's crazy.
L:  And, ah, I know if you refer people with your pin number --
R:  Yeah.
L:  If you refer men --
R:  Yes.
L:  You will get, ah, referral bonuses.
R:  Really?
L:  Yes, but -- but -- but they -- they're -- they have a lot of women signed up so --
R:  They're looking more for men?
L:  -- if you refer a woman, you won't get any -- you won't get a referral -- you won't get a bonus.
R:  Oh, okay.  I know, I told the guys at work about it.
L:  Oh, yeah, there you go.
R:  I didn't know there that if I gave them my pin, okay.  I mean, it's not big money but it's kind of I mean --
L:  Oh, it's fun, it's ten minutes.
R:  I tell you what, for thirty minutes -- I mean for thirty bucks it's not too bad.
L:  Right.  Is this your first call?
R:  Oh, second.  [NOISE] I tried to call [NOISE] -- hey, I got my son with me.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Yes.  I am trying to give him his reader's piece[?].
L:  So what -- ah, where do you live at?
R:  Well, we're staying in Oxheart right now, I'm originally from Long Beach though.
L:  Oh, so you are in California too, okay.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, the other guy I spoke to, he was in Illinois.
L:  Oh, I'm in California, I'm out here in Redlands California by San Bernardino.
R:  Oh, San Bernardino.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, see, we're going to be moving to Vegas in about a week or two.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah, so it's --
L:  Well, let's see, airport security.  [LAUGH] Do you think that it, um, do you think that it will help with the terrorism?
R:  No, I don't think so, I doubt it, because I don't know, like guys like those that are, um, from other countries that pretty much hate us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, they're pretty much willing to do anything, I mean, 'cause the last guys, all they had was like, box cutters, I guess, and to be honest, I don't -- I'm not big on watching the news.
L:  I'm not either, really [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but the whole point of like the terrorism thing is that, like first off is to mess with people's minds, like, you know when they hide in the security, the day after the attack, of course they're not going to like attack immediately after they did it, that's the whole point -- see, America is not like it used to terrorism.
L:  Right.
R:  Europe -- Europe and other countries, they have been dealing with it for a long time but this is like the first time we've ever encountered it and that's the whole -- I remember I was cracking up, like rolling down the freeway, um, right after it happened, and it was funny because every -- I just kind of thought about it, like everybody on that freeway knew that guy's name, Bin Laden.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I mean, and that's the whole point of terrorism, it's just to mess with your mind, like, you know, everybody on that freeway was thinking about it and scared about it but you never know when the next -- look, it's been how long, two years?
L:  Right.
R:  Since it happened, and that's when they're going to hit you is when you -- your guard's, for instance, my aunt, it's my wife's aunt actually and she works at, ah, what is it, Santa Barbara air- -- is it Santa Barbara -- yeah, Santa Barbara airport.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  A real tiny airport, and when we first started liv- -- we've only been here about a year in Oxheart.  When we first started coming here and I used to go pick up Vita[?] like, they wouldn't even let me park my car, okay, like you couldn't stop at a standstill, okay?
L:  Right.
R:  And now, I don't know, a couple of weeks ago I went to go pick my wife up from Santa Barbara airport, left my car there, no problems.  You see, it's just like you start feeling comfortable again, [NOISE] you know what I mean?
L:  Right, exactly, complacent.
R:  Yeah, and then it's like when your guard -- when your guard drops, that's when it's going to happen, you know.
L:  Well, I just remember, um, you know, they really upped the security and I saw something -- I can't, to be honest, I can't remember if it was a television special or if it was an article I read --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It was probably more like an article, but this, ah, this reporter went in, ah, undercover.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he had like some type of weapon on him and he was real blatant about it, like he was -- he purposely was acting suspicious.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And, um, and he was of, ah, Arab nature.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he sailed right through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  With -- with no problems, so it's like well --
R:  Well, they were out of problems too because I think, um, what was it, the security that they were using at the airports, they were, um, hired by -- at first when the incident occurred --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they were hired by the airport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But then I think they were, um, they were -- they started afterwards like federal- federally like running it.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, which I think, maybe it helped a little bit but at the same time when they increased the, um, the security like that, then even Americans feel like criminals, you know what I mean?
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, I mean, and that's the whole -- if you think about it, terrorism, it's like, it's pretty ingenious.  I mean, it is sick what they did, but how they did it first off was pretty crazy.  Like, you know, it was pretty creative, and I mean they hit the heart of America.  They did a lot of things just in that one little punch and then like --
L:  Exactly.
R:  And, you know, the after effect is still lingering.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, two years down the road.  And in places, you know, like when they hide in that security, in like, you know, the normal, you know, there's a lot of people are travelling for business, you know, they slow them down.  You get treated like a criminal.  I mean, they get -- they got everybody in so many different ways it's not even funny.
L:  Yeah, and I -- I think it's all prejudicial too because [SIGH] I don't -- I don't think they're -- rou- routine or uniform in the way that they handle it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and --
R:  Oh, definitely but you know what, you know what, I'm not a very prejudiced guy, I mean, like I grew up in Long Beach and there's a lot of different nationalities, but I had to admit even myself, like I kind of, ah, I don't really -- I don't know when I look at someone, it's like of that nationality now.
L:  Right.
R:  You kinda -- you kinda have like, you know, like --
L:  You're all suspicious and --
R:  Not suspicious, but kind of like, you know, you just kind of have like a little bit of hatred in you.
L:  Right.
R:  Just a little bit even, just, I mean, that's me, like being kind of pretty much open minded that, you know, knowing that no one has anything to do with it really, you know what I'm saying?
L:  I -- you know, I grew up in Pamona and --
R:  Yeah, so you kind of know I mean --
L:  Yeah, I -- I know exactly what you mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I was in high school, it was that whole blood and crip games and --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  And I knew, ah, six people who were killed by drive bys and, you know, you try not to be pre- -- you know, you try not, you know, you try not to be prejudicial.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, especially when something that major happens, that whole September eleventh, it was just --
R:  But I mean it really hurts because, I mean, like how many people --
L:  Exactly.  Do you remember afterwards?
R:  What's that?
L:  Um, I remember seeing on the news, you know, of course that they, um, you know, that the -- the Ar- -- the Arab Americans I guess you call them, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Arab Americans were scared because people were threatening them.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That's so ridiculous.
R:  No, yeah, but, you know what, you got to think right, especially I guess in New York.  I think, um, some -- some of the people, you know, the Arabs, they got like brutally attacked by, like, some New Yorkers.
L:  Right.
R:  Who were just infuriated by, you know, like common sense is going to tell you, like, if you're rational about this, of course they're not involved in it.  I mean, there's so much like, you just get so angry inside that it even happened, you know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  But then you're going to be taking it out on the wrong person but then again, that's terrorism again.  I mean, they're just messing with people's minds big time.
L:  Yeah, they --
R:  It's crazy.
L:  -- basically accomplished what they wanted.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- which was to strike fear in the hearts of Americans.
R:  You -- you know what scares me, and I tell Sal all the time, my wife, is like, you know, because that was the stupidest thing to do is to be on the look out immediately like -- I mean, the day after, they just came down with an iron fist with security and trying to --
L:  Right.
R:  -- anticipate any other way -- they're even going to like, movie studios, the people who write movies to get ideas of how these terrorists could attack, you know what I'm saying.
L:  I remember -- you're right, I remember reading about that.
R:  It was -- it was really creative how they did this one, you know, but it was stupid for us to think that they're going to, you know, attack us immediately afterwards.  I mean, this is -- this right now, now that it's settled down and everything is calm again, you know, and like everybody is kind of laid back about it --
L:  That's when they need to --
R:  This is when it's going to happen again, this is when it's going to happen again.
L:  Exactly, because we've become complacent.
R:  Because it's like -- it's like --
L:  With your security.
R:  Oh, there was this trippy thing on, um, like, a CNN special or something, and they were showing this like one, ah, like, CNN rep- -- because that's the only news I'll really watch, is like CNN.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, they had this reporter go over to, um, some Arab country, like, you know, Afghanistan or something like that, ah, three or four months prior to it happening, and there is an Arab guy and he was all -- he was like a terrorist, and he was all cocky saying, "You know what, and we could go over there to America and we could blow up your White House, we could -- we could do anything we want if we wanted to.  All we need is three guys that are really down", and the reporter even, like, you know, being really cocky Americans like, no way, there's no way, and even that guy that at that point was telling him straight up, like, you know, I could -- we could get you any time we want to.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, that's only like, you know, the heightened security, you know, does it help?  I don't think so because if you have two determined, like just one or two determined individuals, enough to give up their own lives --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you're screwed, you're screwed right then.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Because, I mean, they're willing to give -- make the ultimate sacrifice for their belief.  I mean --
L:  Well, yeah, 'cause they believe that, um, dying for their cause by killing other people will, you know, with Allah and everything, there is --
R:  But they're even --
L:  That's a good thing, so they're more than willing to do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I mean --
R:  Oh, no, and not like I think, I'm not certain but I think their religion, even like is like claiming to have saved them a special place in Heaven if they do some kind of stuff like that, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like, it's just wild, it is wild.
L:  I remember right after seven -- September eleventh here in Redlands there was this, ah, there was the Islamic centre [LAUGH] and those people were so frightened of retaliation that --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they plastered American flags all over their building [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My -- my friend's, um, ah, what is it, his -- his brother in law, he
