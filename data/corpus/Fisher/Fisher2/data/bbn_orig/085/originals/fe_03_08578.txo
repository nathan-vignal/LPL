L:  Hello.  My name's Nicole.
R:  Hi.  My name's Peggy.
L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you doing?
L:  Good.
R:  That's good. [LAUGH]
L:  This a different topic, huh? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  This one's a little more intense.  Usually they have no brainers.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, ah, I don't know.  I don't -- I don't watch the news.  It depresses me.
R:  I know.  I'm, kinda, the same way but I just did hear President Bush talk about he's finally admitting to the fact that, maybe, there's not weapons in Iraq.  Hm.  So, there's, kind of, a lot of unrest over there as a result of that -- his admission to that.
L:  That there's not weapons in Iraq?
R:  The nuclear -- remember his whole main reason of us really going in there was because we were, you know -- the weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, [MN] they really haven't found really anything significant so far so the other --
L:  E- --
R:  -- day, when he was in Africa -- I just heard this, I don't watch the news a lot either --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that he did, kinda, sorta, make an admission to the fact he couldn't find any weapons of mass destruction.  Like, any concrete evidence at this point.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Even though they kept saying there was allegations of this and allegations of that.  And I, kinda, feel like [SIGH] -- I don't know.  Sometimes I think we stick our fingers in the pudding too much.
L:  Well, I mean, do, ah --
R:  But I know we have to so --
L:  We have to because th- they all come to us anyway.
R:  I know.
L:  And --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Is that the only reason why we were over there?  Ah, let's remember, nine eleven.
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  They killed us.
R:  Sure.  But i- it's --
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  But not --
L:  And we're not supp- -- we're supposed to take the -- turn the other cheek --
R:  Well, sure --
L:  -- because we're America.
R:  -- but it wasn't, like, directly associated with him either, is what I'm saying.  They d- -- they don't really n- -- even know where that's a whole different ...  I know.  There's just so many issues.
L:  It's ridiculous.
R:  It's not just --
L:  That's why I don't watch the news 'cause it pisses me off. [LAUGH]
R:  I d- -- it's not just Iraq though, it's --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- other, I mean, countries that we're harvesting, ah, the, ah -- what's his face? [LAUGH] I can't remember his name right now.
L:  Saddam or Bin Laden?
R:  Bin Laden.  Yeah.  I mean, he's not really directly responsible for Bin Laden. [NOISE] So -- but I mean, I'm not saying he's not at fault but I'm just saying that that was -- he's -- they're -- and Iraq's, like, one of the many issues.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  And will there ever b- --
L:  Well, it -- it just doesn't make any sense to me.  They --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They don't want us over there, you know, the people and the leaders, why do they bother us?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, some of them want us over there and some of them don't and s- some, ah, people are extremists and some aren't and I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know if it's ever gonna be resolved.  There's too many -- there's so many issues that have been going on for so long --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- from the beginning --
L:  It --
R:  -- of time, it seems like.
L:  Yes.  Since before I was born, probably.
R:  Oh, since before, you know -- it's always been crazy over there.
L:  Well, I know -- I know -- we'll -- we'll probably --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- have problems with them --
R:  Through religious conflicts --
L:  -- forever.
R:  -- which turn into, you know --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- [LAUGH] everything.
L:  No one -- it's not like we -- both sides won't just say, "Okay, whatever" and leave each other alone. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Plus, there's extremists in each country.  Like, sm- -- a lot of the people do want peace.  Like, I've talked to people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who were from there and they're, like, "Most of the people are just normal people like you and I" but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- then there's those crazy, extremist people that screw it up for everybody else.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And then they have to -- all the other people have to suffer so that's, kinda, why we try to go over there and help.  But then nothing really ever seems to get resolved.
L:  No.  No.  Because then we do something --
R:  It's --
L:  -- and then --
R:  I'm sorry.
L:  -- you know, somebody has to say something.  You know, what they -- it's -- it's, like, a -- it's, like, a bad divorce with lots of kids involved. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  You can't just break away and leave each other alone.
R:  I know.
L:  You know?
R:  And you know what?  And every ten[?] -- and the US is like the, ah -- the person that gets in the middle of a fight and gets punched in the face all the time. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  H- -- a- -- [LAUGH]
R:  And it's never gonna change.  I don't see, like, we -- we --
L:  They're just trying to break it up. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  And they are -- and they're the ones that end up getting kicked in the butt, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  So [NOISE] --
L:  It doesn't make any sense.
R:  That was our microwave I just heard on the phone.  That was weird.
L:  Oh. [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  My, um -- my girlfriend watches the news all the time, ah, you know, when we're doing that code red and orange and yellow and she's, like, "Oh, my god, you have to go get this and you have to go get that".
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm, like -- she's, like, "Aren't you watching it?"  I'm, like, "No.  Because you know what?  If they drop something on us, gas, whatever --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- I d- -- [MN] I don't wanna be worried about it before it ha- -- before it happens".  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  What's a little duct tape and plastic gonna save me from?
R:  Oh, wasn't that awful?  My son --
L:  Yo- --
R:  -- works at, ah, BJs and he said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that week that, ah -- that all that was going on --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- people were buying, like, cases of duct tape and c- -- and they were making a fortune.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then I saw --
L:  My girlfriend said her mom has --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- loads of bottled water that she doesn't touch --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because she bought it at that time.
R:  [LAUGH] It's crazy.
L:  It's -- it's crazy.  I was, like, you know, I'm just gonna go out, I'm gonna go to work, I'm gonna go to the mall, do whatever I want.
R:  Mm.
L:  'Cause I'm not gonna be worried about something that may or may not happen.  And if it happens, I hope it's quick. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, if it happens, there's nothing anybody can do.  You can't sit in a room with duct tape and, ah -- and plastic 'cause you can't breathe after a few hours so you're --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- gonna die of suffocation, which --
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  Which --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  Which then s- -- that happened to some man in California.  W- what --
L:  Really?
R:  -- state are you from?
L:  New Jersey.
R:  Okay.  I'm from Pennsylvania.  I've -- I've s- -- -talked to a couple of other people and they don't seem to be out of this area, like, Pennsylvania, New Jersey --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- New York.  Um, and he died of suffocation.  He was an older man.  Can you imagine the poor guy?  He was taping his whole room up and then [SIGH] --
L:  No oxygen.  There was no ventilation.
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH] And you're die a slow, suffering death instead of a --
L:  I know.  Right.  Get all dizzy and pass [inaudible] instead of just real quick and to inhale some biological warfare and -- and pass out and not know it.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And there were -- like you said, there's nothing they're gonna be able to do but I guess we have to s- -- kinda, stay with the subject.  I guess that's the subject, right?
L:  Yeah.  It's still --
R:  We can --
L:  -- talking about the war and everything.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I -- like you said, I don't think that anything will --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- ever be resolved.  We've been arguing with people overseas whether it's [NOISE] Iraq [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- Vietnam [NOISE] or Japan, forever.
R:  But then where do we get to the point where we -- like, you look at the money spent and what did we -- like, a- are they gonna rebuild over there?  We promise this, we promise that, we go in a- and are we going to really rectify the situation?  I mean, I hope to -- I hope that this gets a positive outcome 'cause now --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- things are, like -- people are beginning to doubt over there and Saddam's now coming out with these new video tapes or came out with one I heard.  I didn't see it.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  But that could be, you know --
L:  Old.
R:  -- BS.
L:  It could be old.  Yeah.  And who kn- -- who knows?  Is he alive or is he dead?
R:  He's got so much money.  I was even reading one day that he has part ownership of Woman's Day magazine.  He owns stock --
L:  Well, h- -- a- -- b- --
R:  -- in the company. [LAUGH]
L:  Of what magazine?
R:  Woman's Day [LAUGH] magazine.  I was, like, oh, my --
L:  Oh, my god, I love that magazine. [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  And I'm, like, "God, I read this magazine.  I can't stand the man".  But he earns so much money he put all his money into stocks and he's so powerful as far as money goes.  He's built up all this stuff and he's, like, so --
L:  He has a gold toilet for god's sake. [LAUGH]
R:  I- -- what's that?
L:  [NOISE] He has a gold toilet.
R:  It's an old toilet?
L:  [NOISE] Did you hear that?  A solid gold toilet.
R:  Oh.  I was --
L:  Is that ridiculous?
R:  He owns a solid gold toilet, you're saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  In his palace.
R:  Oh, I'm sure.  Is his palace in existence still?
L:  Um, I believe it's -- it's there.  They had, like, you know -- people looted in it and stuff but, yeah, the Am- American Army went in there and he had a solid gold toilet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they --
R:  And isn't it a shame all his people are living in, like, this poverty and --
L:  Oh, he had all their food from, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the Gulf War piled up in warehouses.
R:  Yeah.  That's awful.  It's just so sad.
L:  While his people are starving.  Exactly.  It is sad.  The man deserves to get bombed. [LAUGH]
R:  But he's one of many in the world that are like that.  I mean, he's not the only leader that's so --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- sick and -- a- and twisted and --
L:  Demented.
R:  -- you know?  And it's a shame that people are like that.  It -- it's a shame that, you know -- and a lot of it does have to do with, ah, [SIGH] control, religion, the whole, you know, conflicts --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and that area, I'm sure, is not as -- pleasant place to live either 'cause it's all desert.  Everybody's probably cranky all the time.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] You don't --
L:  I think --
R:  -- think of that.
L:  -- if it's so f- -- [LAUGH] I had sand in my eyes all the time.
R:  Sand and it's -- it's -- supposedly one day in Kuwait at -- the other day, it was a hundred and thirty degrees.
L:  Ew.
R:  And those poor soldiers are over in that area.  God.
L:  Oh, god.  L- -- all, you know, s- -- looted up with their, ah -- ah, with their suits and everything.  That's a shame.  That is su- -- a shame.
R:  I know.  It is a shame.
L:  Yep.
R:  I just hope that, you know -- I just hope that everything does have a good result in the long run.  You know what I mean?
L:  Well, to --
R:  It doesn't --
L:  To rebuild their city, we should just take the gold and -- and all the jewels and everything that Saddam had in his palace and use that money to rebuild everything.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  Why n- -- i- it's his people's money anyway.
R:  Right.  It seems -- I don't know.  I just don't really -- I don't hear enough about what's going on over there as far --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as are they rebuilding?  Are people getting the food they need?  Like, I haven't really heard those specifics yet.  And [SIGH] it's, kinda -- I don't know.  I hope -- I hope people aren't just dying needlessly over there at this point when we did go over there to save lives and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- try help them and as well as us, of course.  You know?
L:  Well --
R:  D- --
L:  -- I remember hearing one time that we had dropped food for the people, um, you know, like, ah, peanut butter and pop tarts and stuff like that.
R:  Right.
L:  And some of the people picked it up, threw it down and, like, basically [inaudible] on it.
R:  Spit on it?
L:  It's American food.  We don't want it.
R:  Right.
L:  Well, you know what?  If you're starving, you don't turn down food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Food is food no ma- -- [inaudible] what it is.
R:  But, you know, I guess if someone came into our country and [inaudible] -- I don't know.  I mean, we're not there -- I don't know, like, how many families have been killed and -- and how many houses have been destroyed and their wholes have been -- where we're sitting over here in our same situation, you know what I mean?  So, it's hard for us to really, um, be able to compare ourselves to them, like, without being judgmental.  You know what I saying?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is hard.
R:  I mean, if we, you know -- if we didn't like our country but then somebody came over and they said, "Oh, we're gonna help you" and they're throwing stuff down and you might end up being worse off than you were in the beginning. [LAUGH]
L:  It po- --
