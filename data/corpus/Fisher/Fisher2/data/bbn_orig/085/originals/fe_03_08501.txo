L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.  Who's this?
R:  Hi, my name is Sheila.
L:  Hi Sheila.  It's- -- my name's Jordan.
R:  Hi Jordan.
L:  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Have you done this before?
R:  Just once before.
L:  Yeah, myself same.
R:  Oh okay. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We're new to this.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, today's topic is the um, recent sport um, strikes, I guess?
L:  Right.
R:  Okay.
L:  And how we feel about the players.
R:  And how we feel about that.
L:  Salaries.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know, I've had this discussion a lot with my brothers. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, you know, sometimes I think they're way over paid.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know about you.
L:  I completely agree.
R:  Yeah, and I think it's getting a little out of hand actually. [LAUGH] 
L:  I think it's getting very out of hand.
R:  Yeah.  Um, you know, and then they have all these endorsements --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they're just making so much money.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I don't know, I mean, I don't think there's anything we can even do about it, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Not really.  Um, you know, I think really what's happened is that there's no loyalty any more.
R:  Right.
L:  And so it's just whoever's going to pay me the most, that's where I'm going to go.  So now you see, you know, team owners are like, that's what they have to do to keep a good player --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, even though they certainly don't want to ah, be spending so much overhead on their player's salaries that -- it's not like -- someone gets drafted and they're loyal to the fans or the town --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they'll move as soon as they -- you know, they get a better contract.  So --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, that one Philly's player, I live -- I live in Philadelphia --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I know that happened last year, and it was like -- it was a big thing. [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.
R:  Um, I think it was Scott Lolan.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but you know, I mean, I don't know, it's just -- I'm not a real big sports watcher.  I mean, I -- I watch basketball pretty much the most.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I mean it's just -- I don't know.  This whole thing with the Kirby thing going on --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it just makes you think, I don't know [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- what is going on?
L:  Right, exactly.  What is going on?
R:  Um, there's just too much money and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, the kids who are putting money in -- into different things to help people and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, instead of putting this money into sports player's pockets, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  Well I mean, they -- they have -- I suppose someone of the caliber of Kobe, they earn more money than they can possibly spend or know what to do with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  And that's, I don't know what kind of ah, you know, things they have in the leagues to help people, you know, but you can get yourself in -- in very big trouble. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Having that amount of money.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, like, look at Pete Rose. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  Major gambling problems --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and --
L:  They just -- their realities is so like, jaded.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah, they don't -- you know, I, well then I look at someone like Alan Ivorson, and someone that came from nothing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now has so much money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's like um, you know, they don't know how to act, some of them and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's just --
L:  They still don't really know the value of anything [LAUGH] because they went from zero to, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- multi millions, so --
R:  Yeah, it's just --
L:  -- so um --
R:  Yeah.  They ah, live very well [LAUGH] um --
L:  Mhm.  But they have a very high maintenance living.  I'm sure a lot of them, their yearly costs are probably very high.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  
R:  I mean -- yeah.  They're living like celebrities, like --
L:  Yeah.  They're living like rock stars.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they've got six cars, three houses --
R:  An entourage. [LAUGH] 
L:  An entourage, you know, some of the players go out all the time, spend money like crazy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah they, you know will drop thousands just for the night, you know at a club on --
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  -- you know, champagne, Crystal --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- just like how much a bottle and ?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Ah, you know, it's just.  I don't know, and all they're doing -- I mean, not all they're doing, but they're playing a sport.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, [LAUGH] it's just, I don't know. It -- it's a little outrageous.
L:  I just want to know, how much is too much?  I mean, Alex Rodriguez --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- wh- -- what was it?  Like two hundred million dollars or something, his contract?
R:  Is that ?  Yeah, I'm not sure.
L:  Some ridiculous amount, like, where do you draw the line?  Like, one person, you know, Michael Jordan didn't even -- never even got that amount of money.
R:  No.
L:  And, I mean --
R:  I know.  It's just like where are they going to stop?  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you draw the line?
R:  Yeah.  There has to be like some kind of ca- -- you would think there would be some kind of cap on it, but it's like never -- you know, they're always to get the best and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's like they all have, you know 
L:  Well, baseball's the only -- do they have cap in baseball?  I'm not even sure.
R:  I --
L:  Salary cap?
R:  I don't know.  It doesn't seem like they do -- they might.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I -- I to tell you the truth, I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause you hear about it all the time in basketball, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I haven't really heard it in baseball.
R:  Yeah, I mean even the hockey players, they get paid a lot, some of them.
L:  Yeah.  And you know, a lot of -- a lot of -- I know in baseball, really it's the big city teams that are the ones that are making any money and the little team ones basically get money from the other teams.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they're still struggling.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, they have some kind of bargaining collective agreement that, you know, all the top ah, sports towns who, you know, Chicago, New York, Miami and LA have to give a certain amount of money to like, Montreal and --
R:  Oh really?  I didn't know that.
L:  -- you know -- yeah, these -- these small teams, you know, they have some kind of thing --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I don't know exactly how it works --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- but I mean, it's just -- most of these teams claim they lose money.
R:  Really?
L:  I just don't see -- I mean, how it's possible -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for the big teams fend for the little teams --
R:  Yeah, I can see whether it's little or not, like the big teams.
L:  -- where they make it all TV contracts, advertising, all these different revenue, these teams are making so much money enough -- more than enough to cover the players payroll.
R:  Yeah, you would think.  I mean --
L:  You know.
R:  I don't know.  I just -- I just think it's out of hand. [LAUGH] 
L:  It is, and -- and then the strike, they want more money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and then all that happens is that the ticket prices go up and then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, the consumers have to pay even more for that same experience.
R:  Yeah, right.  I mean it's -- it cost -- you know, I have two children, so it costs so much money just to go to a ball game.
L:  Mhm.  I know.  It -- it's a lot of money to --
R:  By the time you buy fo- -- you know, snacks and food and the tickets.  It's like --
L:  Hundred bucks.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just, you know, it's not really affordable any more.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean it used to be like, when I was young, a cheap day out, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- but now it's -- it's just outrageous.
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know, it's just out of control.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  I don't know if they're -- you know, what they can do about it but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you know, they -- they definitely should try to put some type of cap if they haven't already, you know.
L:  They definitely should.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
L:  I think so, yeah.  Has there been talk of any of that?
R:  Excuse me?
L:  Has there been talk of any -- them doing any of that?  Cap wise?
R:  You know, I don't -- I don't know.  I should ask, you know, my brothers.  They would know, they're really more into sports than I am.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you know, I'd have to ask them.
L:  Right.  You're a Sixer's fan, right?
R:  Well, you know, I live in Philadelphia so I have to be loyal to them. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] You know that -- but it's pretty much family sport I watch.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, you know, some of them make major money --
L:  Yeah, I mean, just for sitting on the bench, not even playing a game they make like three hundred grand a year.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know, it's just -- I don't think -- I don't think -- they went on strike a few years ago, the ba- -- the basketball, I think.
L:  Right.
R:  Wasn't it like two years ago?
L:  Mhm.
R:  But 
L:  Yeah, that was the whole league.  
R:  Yeah, I remember the season started really late.
L:  The seas- -- yeah, started real late.  And ah -- I was surprised because ba- -- it really hurt baseball when they struck.
R:  That's -- was that last -- was that last year?
L:  Um, it was a couple of years ago.
R:  Yeah, I remember that.
L:  So, you know, attendance was down afterwards --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- people just were like, they had it, you know, that was it, you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.  We pay way too much money to have it continue going, now we're not going to support it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's just -- it's ridiculous.
R:  People need to take a stand and stop going to these games. [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  You know.
R:  But I don't think that's going to happen.
L:  No.
R:  And people are still going to pay the prices and still go --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  -- and still buy those season tickets.
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know.  Um, you know, I know people who spend outrageous amounts of money on all these season tickets --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it's --
L:  Then they don't go.  I mean, unless you're going to go, what, the season tickets are like a major expense.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  And I know people who like to keep a couple of games
