L:  Good afternoon.
R:  Good afternoon.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm Caroline -- I'm fine, thank you, and you?
L:  I'm good, I'm -- my name is Gill.
R:  Gill, this is Caroline --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, uh, I'm in Atlanta, --
L:  Ah, I'm in New Jersey.
R:  All right?  [LAUGH] We, ah -- my daughter used to live in New Jersey, so, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, uh, what part of New Jersey?
L:  Uh, it's the [MN] -- th- the city is Raleigh, it's just a little south of Newark.
R:   Raleigh, okay.
L:  [MN]
R:   I know about where that is, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sounds good.
L:  Good.
R:  Well, wh- what's your opinions on this Middle East thing?
L:  Well, I -- it's sad that it's happening, that's for sure, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, uh, you know, hopefully they'll come to some type of agreement that they can live together, you know, that's the best thing.
R:  You know, I ju- -- I just wonder, though, if they're going to, 'cause this has been going on for how many years?
L:  Many, many, many, many years.
R:  As long as I -- as long as I can remember it's been going on, and, uh, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I just don't know if it's possible, and, um, as far as the US staying in it, I -- I don't know that that's happening either.
L:  I don't know that it's -- it's helping, I'm not sure that it's hurting, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I -- I just think, if we could find some better way to control the radicals, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, the people that are extreme, um, --
R:  But --
L:  -- I think that, you know, a lot -- a lot more could get done.
R:  Oh, nat- naturally, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause they're -- they're -- the few is what causes all the unrest, in the whole, --
L:  That's correct.
R:  -- in the world, it's not just in the Mid East, it's everywhere, you know, --
L:  Yep, yep.
R:  -- so, it's just a few that, ah, you know, you, um, that -- that do it, but I don't know how you can, ah, isolate those few and, and, ah, control them, you know.
L:  That's true, it's very, very difficult.
R:  So, uh, I don't know.  But all this, uh, peace talk, and I don't know, uh, -- ah, we're lucky we have not been into it, other than the, ah, you know, seven eleven, but, ah, --
L:   -- Mhm.
R:  -- but that's the only thing we've really had any dramatic, ah, thing with us, where, ah, I- Israel has it every day, almost, --
L:  -- that's correct.  Yeah, it's very, very sad.
R:  -- so, ah, I don't know how I would feel if I were in that situation, you know, about the retaliation and all that, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, um, but right now, ah, ah, you know, it seems like you just -- one's killing one to kill the other --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they just -- it's a vicious cycle, so --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- unless somebody stops it somewhere, it's going to continue.  So, ah, --
L:  That's right.  You know, they -- they -- they've got to back off a little bit, and, you know, try to -- try to talk more, and, you know, blow things up less.
R:  Try to -- try to do some compromising somewhere, but yet, when --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you're in that situation, I -- I don't know if I'd be willing to or not, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, I -- I'm not very good at it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, I don't know, but I don't think we should leave them alone, I think we should try to help as much as we can, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I don't know that we'll be -- do any good at it, so, um, but, ah, I --
L:  Well, a- any time that you can help --
R:  Right.
L:  -- is a good thing.
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's, ah, --
R:  Very good.
L:  -- you know, it's, ah, doesn't matter, you know, which God they're -- they're talking about, or which --
R:  Right.
L:  -- piece of land, the --
R:  Right.
L:  -- point is, help and work together, and, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, things can get done.
R:  'Cause there's -- there's enough -nough property for everybody to have, and, so, just compromise on what you can do.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, ah, I don't know, but, um, I don't --
L:  -- if they could try to look at, ah, the different parts of America, ah, and different ways of doing things, I mean, there's -- you know, everybody doesn't like something in America.
R:  Right.
L:  But, you know, the fact that we can build a Muslim church on one corner and a Catholic church on another corner and everybody lives, you know, peacefully, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and goes to their own church, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- then, that's -- that's something that's -- other people should try emulate.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's, uh, it's not a hard thing to do.  So.
R:  Right. If -- if you look at it that way, and you're willing to accept people for what they are, you know, that's the thing, so, --
L:  -- and, then, you know, it's -- it's -- it's harder there because of the di- -- religions are so extremely different, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, but I mean, we have the -- we have the problems even in Ireland, you know, with the Protestants --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and Catholics which are both Christian, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and, --
R:  And -- but they -- they -- they get along better than [LAUGH] the far east, anyway, uh, the Mid East, so, --
L:  That's correct. that's correct.
R:  -- ah, I don't know, but, uh, yeah, but, uh, I wish they could find something or other, but, uh, America keeps trying, and I think, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think as long as they keep something open, where there is some negotiation, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it can't hurt, like I say, I --
L:  No, I don't think so.
R:  -- don't know if it can help, but it certainly can't hurt.
L:  No.
R:  So, ah, so let's just pray that it, you know, will, --
L:  Yeah, it will --
R:  -- and something will come to us, a solution, so --
L:  -- and they'll keep going, and they'll keep getting more progress, --
R:  Right, that's what I'm hoping, because that's, like you say, those radicals are the ones you have to worry about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're -- there are the ones that I'm worried about, here.
L:  That's right.
R:  -- and, uh, I don't know how many of them are over here already, but, --
L:  Probably --
R:  If they didn't come from over there, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:   -- we wouldn't have them, so, --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  But, we've got -- we've got quite a few, I'm sure --
L:  Oh, I'm -- I have no doubt, --
R:  Right.
L:  No doubt.
R:  But, uh, but I wish there was some way that we could -- could help, help them, uh, compromise.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, you know, they're both the same religion, uh, you know, um, more or less, --
L:   Mhm.
R:  -- and, uh, why in the world they can't get along, I -- it's like the Baptists, I mean, you know, you got different groups of Baptists, I'm -- of course, I'm from the South, and so, we have more Baptists than anything else, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you got a lot of different kinds of Baptists.
L:  That's right.
R:  But, um, but, um, you know, they -- they -- like you say, they go to their own church, and they -- they get along fine with everybody, so, --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  I don't know, uh, I -- I don't know.  It's [MN] --
L:  And I think you see, different times, when something happens in the -- the Middle East there, the radicals blow themselves up and cause a lot of damage and injure a lot of people, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, when it comes to, you know, helping and picking up after that, you'll see the two different religions working together.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, the real people.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and --
R:  The people, yeah.
L:  -- you know, if they, we -- we've just got to find a way to identify and control the, uh, the radical factions, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's the -- the biggest problem.
R:  Big -- yeah, that's -- that's really the main problem, as far as I can see, so, uh, I don't -- but I don't know how -- I have no suggestions as to how to do that, but, uh, I certainly would be willing to, uh, for anything to -- to do it.
L:  Just about, yes.
R:  But, uh, anything I would be happy for, so, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I don't know, but, ah, yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I -- I told my daughter on this call, "I'm not sure I -- I want to talk about that, 'cause I really, um, you know, I mean, I know what I believe, but yet, you can't -- when you don't understand the culture that much, and I don't, --
L:  True.
R:  -- it's, ah, it's hard to talk about it that much", --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, ah, I know it's so different from what we believe, but, then again, you know, you see, here, -- I don't know -- well, I'm sure you don't, 'cause you probably work, but I watch The Wedding Story and just recently, they had a young man, an American, who had met a lady here in -- in the States, who was a -- a Cambodian princess, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, they were married on the Wedding Story, and they -- he went back, he's an American but he went back to Cambodia, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to marry, in -- in her religion --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and all this ceremonial thing, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the two, the two families got along fine, well, now, why can't -- why can't to world do that?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, you know, they, they -- he had to give some and she did too.
L:  That's right.
R:  So, ah, but, ah, they -- and of course, they were having the we- -- the ceremony there, because of her -- her grandparents were the king and queen of Cambodia, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, but then, I think, when they were kind of back here, they will have another ceremony for his family, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, ah, to satisfy the king and queen, you know, her family, that was -- they went to all the ceremonies, he went over there, his whole family went over there, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- well, that was lot of compromise, ah, --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- on -- on his part, I think, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to do that, and, ah, and, of course, for her too, you know, but, ah, --
L:  Yeah, if we could eliminate some of the stubbornness in the world, we'd be -- all be better off.
R:  Right, right.  You're right, that -- I agree with you, so, if --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if everybody wouldn't be so determined -- set in their own ways, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, that's -- that's the way it is, I think they're even more so than we are, though.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  But, ah, --
L:  The -- the freedom to believe and to practice what you believe is -- is fine, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- ah, freedom is wonderful, as long as the fre- -- your freedom doesn't interfere with the next person's freedom.
R:  Right, that's --
L:  Then you just, ah, have to compromise a little bit --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and you'll be fine.
R:  Right.  That's what I believe, too, so, we -- we're of one accord there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep, definitely.
R:  Right, so, --
L:  I hope they get it settled pretty soon.
R:  I hope so too.
L:  It would be really, really nice.
R:  But, ah, it would be great if they could settle it all, and all -- I hoped when, um, -- was it Jimmy Carter had the, uh, Camp David accord, with, ah, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, what's that -- got assassinated?  Can't remember now, what was his name, you know?
L:  I can't remember now.
R:  But you know who I'm talking about, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I thought then that might have been the start of s- something, you know, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I -- I was hoping that would be, 'cause it sounded -- I mean, he seemed -- seemed to have been really for it, and then -- but, like, you say, that one fanatic, or a group of fanatics, that [inaudible] did the assassination, they just set the whole thing back, so, --
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  -- so, ah, I don't know.  I wish I had a -- an answer to it, but, --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- I don't know.
L:  I -- I -- I really think, you know, to maintain freedom, um, y- you need to give up a little bit of control, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, I'm not -- I'm not one for wanting the government to pay attention to every little thing I do, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but if I don't have anything to hide, and somebody wants to question me or watch me a little bit, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's fine.
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, it's one --
R:  Yeah, but I don't --
L:  --  the ones that complain the loudest are the ones that have something to hide.  That's the --
R:  Right, that's the way I feel too, --
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  -- and, uh, yeah, I agree with you, so if -- if you have no -- nothing to hide, then you don't mind being questioned, you don't mind being examined, you don't mind being searched, you don't mind this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, ah, you
