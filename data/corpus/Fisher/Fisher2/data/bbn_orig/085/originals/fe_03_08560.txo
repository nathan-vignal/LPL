R:  Hi.  My name is Patricia.
L:  Hi.  My name's Kim.
R:  Kim?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I've never done this before. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.  This is the second time I've done it.
L:  Oh, good.  Friends of mine at work have done it and they seem to always call when I can't.  So, you start and then I'll understand what I'm supposed to do.
R:  Okay.  Well, it's concerning airport security.
L:  Okay.
R:  Do we feel that with the -- all the security that's there now that the airpor- -- the aircraft itself is more secure, you know, up in the air?
L:  I would say probably not.
R:  No.  I don't think so either.
L:  I think, you know, if they're tired or have worked a long time or not really paying attention, it can still happen.
R:  Yeah.  There's so many issues.  'Cause I do fly a lot, ah, from Ohio to Arizona.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah.  And I fly at least three times a year r- --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- you know, round trip.  And, ah, I know the security is good here in o- -- in -- in Cleveland.  And --
L:  It's pretty -- w- -- I'm through Metro --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- Metro Airport in Detroit and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- it is also.  I mean, it seems much heavier than it used to be.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But sometimes you see the folks that are working there and, you know, they're talking with their buddies or what not and it doesn't seem -- you know?
R:  Right.  You don't feel that comfortable that it's that secure?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I understand that because, you know, it's like when you go in there to get on --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to get everything done and get to your plane flight, you're watchi- -- you're watching more than they are.  You know?
L:  A- -- correct.  Correct.
R:  'Cause --
L:  And I -- I think if someone is going to try to do something --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they're gonna be real clever about it.
R:  Oh, they have to be.  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  And that's --
R:  M- --
L:  -- the part that, kind of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think worries [inaudible] everybody.
R:  Yeah.  There's always that fear but then if you look back on nine eleven, who would've thought that that would happen?
L:  I know.
R:  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, so, they have come a long way with it.
L:  Oh, I agree.  I -- I agree with you.  I really do.
R:  I mean, considering the airports and other federal buildings --
L:  No.  They've --
R:  -- they've come a long way with it but --
L:  It's sad that we even have to do it.
R:  It is.
L:  It really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- bothers me that we have to even worry about those things.
R:  I know that.  But it --
L:  But I -- I sure understand why they do it. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, they have to.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They --
R:  But it doesn't frighten me from flying.
L:  Oh, no.  Me neither.
R:  Because I look at it this way, if anything's gonna happen, it's my time to go.
L:  Exa- -- I -- I believe in fate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- very strongly.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  I do too.
R:  And, um, I guess they'll let us know when our ten minutes are up but, ah, now they're talking about getting dogs down there.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  And taking off your shoes.  Yeah.  The dogs can sniff out bombs --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- explosives, and, ah, m- -- probably amongst other things like, you know, drugs and all that.
L:  Correct.
R:  But I think that anybody that would make an attempt to do a high jacking nowadays --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would have to be strung out on something.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Because, you know -- because of the publicity --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everything.
L:  And -- and --
R:  You know?
L:  Right.  How it is being watched more.
R:  Yes.  Yeah.
L:  But I also think it's a good idea to have the animals in there because --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they're not -- they're more objective than us humans can be.
R:  Right.  And they're more visible too.  They would scare somebody off, I would think, more than a security --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- guard standing there.
L:  I think so too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They'd think, "Hm".  Let's just hope it doesn't happen anymore, you know?
R:  I know.  I know it.
L:  Did you we- -- did you have any --
R:  I mean, when I saw that first -- the second plane, I knew right away, you know, that it wasn't just an accident.
L:  No.  W- were you --
R:  And I told my sister -- 'cause she was visiting from Arizona --
L:  Oh, was she?
R:  And, ah, she w- -- in fact, she was going back, like, a week later and -- to Arizona from -- she visits me every year and I visit out there twice a year but I said, "There's gonna be a war".
L:  Oh.  Well -- yeah.  I -- I mean, it seemed we had to do that.  We had just come back that -- that Monday from Chicago.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And -- and, you know, you -- and we talk so much about it here as a family because we -- I mean, never in a million years did you ever even think of things like that.
R:  No.  I know.
L:  You just didn't have to.
R:  No.  No.  It was the furtherest thing from your mind.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when they would ask you if -- if you've left your bags at any time or has anybody asked you to carry anything on for them, you know, it was, like, "No".
L:  No.
R:  You know?
L:  Right.
R:  But nowadays, it's -- it's taken very seriously.
L:  Yes.  It -- it -- it's a shame.  But I'm glad --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that they are being more careful though.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I just --
R:  Yeah.  I feel more --
L:  A- --
R:  -- secure.
L:  Oh, I do too.
R:  As far as that goes.  You know?
L:  I do too.  But I -- I honestly think if they're up to something, they're gonna find a way to do it.  That's what bothers me more.
R:  Definitely.  Definitely.
L:  The e- -- you know, I think evil goes real deep.
R:  R- -- oh, yeah.  And they're -- they're not stupid people.
L:  Mm mm.
R:  You know, they -- they know what they're doing and they have a goal.
L:  Unfortunately.
R:  And a mission.  Yes.
L:  I agree.  I agree with you.
R:  Well, yeah.
L:  Very much.  So, you've done this before, huh?
R:  Ah, this is the second time.
L:  Oh.
R:  My daughter does it.  She talks -- ah, she gets a couple a calls a week.
L:  Wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's neat.
R:  Mhm.
L:  This is the first one -- there's been two when, you know, how you grab the phone and if I don't make it quite in time I go, "Ah" 'cause there's only so many seconds.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I -- I think it's a nice way to do things.  It's nice. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  It's interesting.  And you get to meet people.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you're from Ohio and I'm from Michigan so --
R:  Yeah.  Different states.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  It's, kinda, nice.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  The other lady I had was from New Jersey.
L:  Oh, that'd be neat.
R:  And we talked about, ah -- it was also terrorist.
L:  [MN] It's probably quite a [NOISE] big topic with things.
R:  I'm sure it is.  Yeah.
L:  All this research and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what not.
R:  And I guess they wanna get the public's opinion, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- of everything.
L:  Hoping that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- this stuff doesn't happen again.
R:  That's for sure.
L:  Boy, it's storming out here. [LAUGH]
R:  Is it really?  We've --
L:  Oh, my goodness. [LAUGH]
R:  We've had 'em so bad here the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- trees are all over the place.
L:  Oh, we d- -- we d- -- we had a -- a little -- a head of ban- -- bad lightning.  Right down our road there were two trees down and we lost power last week.  It's just, like --
R:  And you're in Detroit?
L:  I'm in -- y- -- I'm -- I'm outside of Detro- -- I'm in -- do you know the Michigan area?
R:  M- --
L:  I'm outside of [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  [inaudible].
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  We're, kinda, more in the country but it's --
R:  Th- that means we're gonna get it in then --
L:  A- --
R:  -- 'cause we get what you've had.
L:  Yeah.  It usually comes down --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But then if you look -- it looks like a few miles down it's bright out.  So, you just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's summer.
R:  But you know what I don't understand?  They're so concerned about the airports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- why aren't they concerned about the ships?
L:  You know, b- -- we've talked about that at work.  The cruise lines.
R:  Yes.
L:  And I know there's been a lotta articles about that.  For some reason, it doesn't seem to be hit as much.
R:  No.  I know.
L:  And it sure could cause some devastation.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Because it does travel, you know, all around the United States --
L:  You're right.
R:  -- and North America.
L:  You're right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And the trains.  You know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the railroad area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Maybe because that's what their first target was so that's where we're concentrating.
R:  Yeah.  I think --
L:  Ah --
R:  They may throw us for a loop the next time.
L:  Yes.  'Cause I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- don't know how those folks think to be --
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  I couldn't think that way.
R:  No.  No.  No.
L:  Not a ch- --
R:  Nobody in their right mind could.
L:  No.  No.  There's not a chance.  And you're right, probably -- they probably -- with the drugs and everything probably.
R:  Yeah.  They're des- --
L:  Has to be something.  Boy.
R:  They're desperate.  They're desperate people.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  So, it's a shame.
L:  [inaudible] Yes, it is. [PAUSE]
R:  So, I'm waiting to watch the lottery so I can hit that twenty five million tonight.
L:  And I sure hope you do.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I really do.
R:  So, I can --
L:  If I -- if I hear your name, I'll -- even the first name, I'll -- oh, boy, that would be wonderful.
R:  Oh, wouldn't it? [LAUGH]
L:  Heck, yeah.  Oh, my gosh, when I heard about that Pennsylvania one this --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  We just both went, "Oh, my god".
R:  I know.
L:  But since I don't play -- I mean, I d- -- you know how you just don't think about it?  I hope you -- that would be a wonderful shot for ya.
R:  Oh, that's -- I tell ya --
L:  That would be a topic, wouldn't it?
R:  Oh, sure would be. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I could speak for hours on that one.
L:  Heck, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You could.  How are you gonna spend it?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I- it's gone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's already spent. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I know.  Wouldn't it be nice though? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I'd buy my own airlines. [LAUGH]
L:  There you go.  And security teams.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  That would be cool too.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Yeah. [NOISE] Jeeze. [NOISE]
R:  But -- what are you doing?  Dishes?
L:  I'm -- no.  I'm making dinner. [NOISE]
R:  Oh.
L:  It's -- and we usually eat later on the weekends.  I made --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- eggplant parmesan.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  Yeah.  I have an Italian background and --
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  My daughter's married to an Italian.
L:  I'm married to an Italian.  I'm English.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But he loves -- I love foreign cooking.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he -- you know, that's his background and his parents are gone so --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- I try to take it up as much as I could.
R:  Well, that's nice.
L:  Well, yeah.  You got- -- you gotta feed 'em to keep 'em, you know?
R:  That's for sure.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- what keeps 'em.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Sometimes I wanna think that.
R:  Yep.
L:  Jeeze oh Pete's.  It's not easy.
R:  [LAUGH] No.  It isn't.
L:  No.  T- --
R:  And nowadays, you know, the way things are.
L:  I've got an old fashioned one so it's good.
R:  That's --
L:  And we didn't get married 'til we were in our thirties so --
R:  That's --
L:  -- that was probably another plus.
R:  Yes.  It w- -- yes, it is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes.  It is.
L:  It's hard enough every day.
R:  Yeah.  It is.
L:  But I hope your traveling goes good for you next time you go.
R:  Oh, it will.  I'm n- not concerned.
L:  No.
R:  The only thing I don't like is they tell you to be down there two hours early because of security.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when you get down there they tell you, "Oh, an hour is fine".  You know --
L:  But --
R:  -- I have to get up at four o'clock in the morning and --
L:  I -- but see, we went -- I had to go on one flight and I'm glad I was there.  See, w- -- it -- a lot of times, we hit the construction and stuff getting into the airports and --
R:  Yes.  We do too.
L:  -- that can blow a half an hour you weren't expecting.
R:  Yes.
L:  You know?
R:  Easy.  And I always go mornings early so that, you know, I'm there early because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it's a three hour time difference for us when we get there -- when I get there.
L:  But is that a real nice -- that's -- Arizona's wonderful.  It's --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  It's --
R:  Oh, I love it.
L:  It i- -- it's as wonderful as they say, is- --
R:  M- --
