R:  Hi.  My name is Judy.
L:  Hi Judy.  My name is Julie. [LAUGH]
R:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.
L:  You too.  Do you travel a lot?
R:  Ah, no.  Actually, I don't.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, I don't fly that often but I have friends that do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I don't know how secure they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- really feel.
L:  Oh, really? [LAUGH]
R:  Mm mm.
L:  Everybody's saying something different?
R:  Yeah.  And -- right.  I don't know how secure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The last time, actually, I flew was right after nine eleven.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That was -- I flew in October about a month after nine eleven --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and the airport was practically empty.  I flew from New York to Cincinnati for a family function and the airport was practically empty.  And --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it was so strange, you know, seeing all the -- the soldiers with the guns and everything.  And they were just -- at that time, it seemed like they were very careful --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, about security.  Although, more so on the return trip in the airport in Cincinnati than New York.  The s- -- the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Ah, security was tighter --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- there than it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- was, ah, leading, you know, i- -- when we left LaGuardia.  Do you travel a lot?
L:  Of -- um, nor- -- I used to.  I -- I haven't as much this year but yes, um, I'd -- used to -- the last five years' I've traveled -- I've flown at least a half a dozen times a -- a year. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  So, that's a lot more than a lot of [LAUGH] Americans fly.
R:  Right.
L:  But seri- -- usually --
R:  [MN]
L:  Most years, fewer than a dozen flights.  I mean, round trips.  So, that --
R:  And --
L:  Yeah.  So, I've cashed --
R:  Ha- --
L:  -- in a lot of frequent flyer miles over the last few years though.
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah, well, how -- do you feel that security --
L:  W- --
R:  -- is good and that it is --
L:  Y- yeah.  Actually, I -- I appreciate the airport security.  Although, I'm really u- um -- and I don't think it's that much of an inconvenience.  Um, I actually like the, ah, reception gates being quieter without these big groups of people in the way that [LAUGH] slow you down.  I can move --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more quickly through an airport, um, get myself to the baggage area, whatever.  We can meet people in the baggage area instead of at the gate.  The gate -- gate chaos was really inconvenience to me.  So -- so, as a single person coming and going a lot, I'd -- the big groups of families, crying babies and all that, just, like, "Oh, brother".
R:  I --
L:  Um --
R:  -- hear that.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, I -- I have children but they're -- and grandchildren a- -- you know -- no -- no -- [several inaudible words] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I -- I just meet -- as a matter of fact, I just recently -- in April, I had to pick up my grandson who flew up from Florida -- he had been down there visiting his grandfather in Florida -- and he flew up here to spend part of Easter with me before going back home upstate.  So, I picked him up in, ah, LaGuardia and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I -- you couldn't pick, y- you know -- you couldn't just go up to the plane, ah, y- -- I had to wait for him even though he was, you know, not really an adult.  He was --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- fifteen years old.  Um, and there was a lot of -- a lot of confusion down by the -- the baggage area where I did pick him up.  It took quite a while.  I should've gotten him right away but I -- I didn't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, but I -- I'm -- I don't mind the idea of the extra security.  I mean, they do it in Israel and look, they have no terrorism on the planes.  If you noticed, they're pretty safe on their planes and they're very strict.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, you know, people get used to it.  I -- I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  We have a problem in this country, I think, that we want everything.  We want everything to be secure but nothing to stop us from doing whatever we want --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  -- whenever we want, which is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really s- stupid.  I mean, you know, when you stop and think about it.  Everything has to have a price, you know?  If you wanna be secure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then you gotta have to be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- inconvenienced and that's just something you have to deal with.
L:  Yeah.  But [NOISE] the -- there's some stuff that came out in the news this past week that, to me, is extremely alarming.  The, um -- and I have friends who are in shipping so it's also -- I mean, the -- longshoreman's, um, so both -- and I've asked them about their security but apparently, cargo that goes, um, onto the planes isn't screened because it --
R:  Oops. [NOISE]
L:  -- the, ah, passengers -- those of us who are American citizens and not even close to the profiling that they're looking for, for Al Qaeda people, we are being co- -- inconvenienced and run through little, um, scanners and everything to the degree that they're, [LAUGH] you know, asking about your kind of underwear and, ah, you know, "Is that an under wire bra?"  Um, and m- -- and t- -- having to take off our shoes.  Ci- -- American citizens who are not profiled as a concern are going through that and whatever people wanna ship is not going through these x- -- ah, -ray machines.
R:  Oh, that's not good.
L:  If the journalists were correct that are -- that came out with this.  Um, that's a real big concern for me. [LAUGH] Ah, it's just --
R:  Well, now th- -- now that you mention it, ah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it would be a concern for me too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because heaven only knows what they can slip onto a plane.
L:  Yep.  So -- but now that -- that -- a -- a journalist has, kind of, e- exposed that big, um, chink in the armor, hopefully there'll be some major changes.  Um, [LAUGH] because if people can walk through a metal detector, why can't they run a bunch of these things through?  At least to look for, you know, um --
R:  Well, there are hand held --
L:  -- basic stuff.
R:  -- metal detectors that they can, you know, have someone go through air- -- through the cargo holds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I- it's no big deal.
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  And they have bomb sniffing dogs that they can u- -- so, it see- --
L:  Yeah.  Right.
R:  A- and that's another problem that I have in this country is everything is money driven.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Money comes before people and safety.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I'm really concerned about the breakdown our civil liberties.  Um, it -- it -- it'll, you know, definitely --
R:  Oh, you've n- -- you've noticed that? [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, absolutely.
R:  You --
L:  It's just nuts.
R:  You've noticed that, piece by piece, they are --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, disassembling the constitution?
L:  Yeah.  And, ah --
R:  Ah, and I thought it was just my imagination.
L:  And then military planes and helicopters flying low over neighborhoods -- they're supposed to make -- we're -- we're supposed to be getting the message that we're safe but we're being harassed and strafed and it's, um -- it's [LAUGH] really not okay.  It's i- -- you know?  It's -- it's just terrorizing --
R:  I'll --
L:  -- our own people and it's -- w- we don't want to live -- I mean, this is a place of liberty.  We really want to experience --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that and celebrate it.
R:  Did -- did -- did you -- did you let them know in Washington that this is America, the land of the brave and the free?
L:  [LAUGH] Well --
R:  I think -- I think that --
L:  That we -- we need --
R:  -- somewhere, they forgot that.
L:  I sent a lot of emails but, you know, what, um --
R:  Ah, n- --
L:  We don't -- we don't have a majority in congress that --
R:  I'm not sending emails to the government.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I'm not --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- emailing -- I don't want my name on their list any place.  Hello?
L:  Yep.  Yeah.  I'm listening.
R:  Hello?
L:  I'm listening.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Is your phone okay?
R:  Ah, yeah.  I -- I -- sometimes --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it gets funny, you know?
L:  Yeah.  It --
R:  Um --
L:  It cut out a few minutes ago.
R:  Okay.  Yeah.  This is [LAUGH] ga- -- wh- when our contract is up, we're going someplace else.  I have to tell you.
L:  Mm.
R:  Be- because I -- I've been in the middle of conversations, ah, where I'm trying to use --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- customer service for something and all of a sudden, goodbye, they're not there and I've gotta start the whole thing all over again.
L:  Oh, man.
R:  Which is a hassle.  But anyhow, that's not what [LAUGH] we're supposed to be talking about.  We're supposed to be talking about a- -- security -- airport security --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and terrorism.  And if -- truthfully, I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they use a lot of the, ah -- a- -- that they throw the terrorism up to give themselves excuses to do all kinds of things that they shouldn't be doing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- also wanna k- -- they wanna keep us off balance so that we won't notice that they are eroding our civil liberties inch by painful inch.  And now, not even by inches, they're doing --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it by yards.
L:  Yeah.  And it seems that -- that the over emphasis on this homeland security thing and reshuffling everything is partly over compensation and to try dir- -- distract us from the fact that the CIA and others knew that this kind of thing was gonna happen.  And FBI and others were tracking specific guys with specific names who w- were, you know, getting these pilots' licenses, were known to be anti American.  There were -- concerns were raised.  Employees did speak up and say, "Hey, this is stuff that we've been monitoring and it's -- and it's -- it's high -- it's high risk".
R:  [MN]
L:  And, um, [LAUGH] there was still no int- intervention.
R:  Yeah.  Well, and they're -- they're -- they're gonna skip right past that because they don't wanna be sued left and right, which is what should happen.  Ah, [SIGH] I -- I don't trust the government.  I really don't.  Not at -- not one bit.
L:  Yeah.  I think we have to try as specific as possible, you know, to names and who and -- and what, so it isn't such a generic thing that nobody will vote anymore because that's not -- it's not true and no- not correct that everybody in government is bad.  You know?  But --
R:  No.  And I know it.  Not --
L:  But the people who --
R:  Not everybody --
L:  But the people who a p- -- say, the CIA, for example --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the State Department are saying that, um, somebody lied to them about mass -- weapons of mass +destruction and nukes and, um --
R:  Oh, the h- -- the whole business about --
L:  -- in Iraq.  Um --
R:  -- a- ah, what -- what he said in his speech and --
L:  Those people oughta go.
R:  -- a- --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the double talk that -- that we got there.
L:  Yeah.  So, it means that -- that they've gotta go.
R:  But you know what?  People are getting smarter.  People are getting smarter and they're not trusting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  A- --
L:  More than a hundred members of Ronald Regean's administration were, um, indicted --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, during -- during -- before he was even out of office and it seems to me that the George Bush parade of folks oughta be -- all going to court [LAUGH] pretty soon, sometime very soon, including Col- Colin Powell.
R:  I'll vote for that.
L:  A- -- was Colin Powell just shilling -- pardon the expression -- for, um, the religious right or did he really have facts?  Were those pictures really pictures of --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- military installations?  They said, "We know where they are".  And they aren't there.
R:  Yeah.  Then why didn't you find them?
L:  Was a- -- was Colin +Powell -- Powell lying to the United Nations on behalf of the United States?  If that's the case, I want him indicted.  And [MN] even if people like him personally, he is a crook if he was lying to the world saying, "We know where those things are" and, you know, all that.  That's just -- if that was a lie, that was a lie.  And it's worse than what even Nixon did.
R:  Well, i- in -- in my opinion, um, they don't keep him in the loop.  They feed him what they want him to know.
L:  Yeah.  He's their --
R:  I -- a- --
L:  par- -- he's their boy.
R:  I don't -- I -- I --
L:  Although, why he's that --
R:  Because --
L:  But the thing is, he's [LAUGH] -- if -- if he --
