L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name is Bill.
R:  My name is Georgia Lynn.
L:  Hi Georgia Lynn.
R:  Yes.  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in Northern California.  
R:  I am in Pennsylvania.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.
L:  Ho!  So you're like, night time.
R:  Yes, why are you day time?
L:  Well no, but I mean it's -- it's ni- -- it's just getting eight o'clock here so --
R:  I'm almost eleven here. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, wow.  I didn't know Fisher's were still -- still making calls so I got totally surprised by this.
R:  Well I put down eleven o'clock for mine.  I have an Alzheimer's husband who --
L:  Oh my.
R:  -- I have to put to bed around ten so I knew I couldn't be here till eleven. [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Anyway, this question was about the strike by the athletes.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't actually know there was a strike going on right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well I guess I didn't either, but and -- and they also ask what we think about their high salaries.
L:  Yeah, well what do you think about that? [LAUGH] 
R:  Well I don't think much of that. [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't either to be honest with you.  I think it's kind of absurd.
R:  I -- I think it's kind of a slap in the fan's faces when they strike.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I think when you're living on, like, I live on under twenty five thousand a year 'cause I'm retired --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my husband had no good social security --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I don't know how you're living, but even so --
L:  Well not much better -- not much different to that to be honest with you.  Yeah.
R:  I have a couple of children that make in the forty thousand range, but they work really hard for that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I think this is a chosen thing by these athletes.
L:  Right.
R:  It isn't like -- we go and ask for our jobs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they come and get them.
L:  Right.
R:  And I think that it's pretty bad when you have to have millions of dollars to do the thing that you've been asked to come do.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That you want to do.  It's what you want to do.
L:  Well yeah, it -- it's a game. [LAUGH] I mean, and -- and then the fans have to pay -- I -- I haven't gone to a sporting event.  I'm not a normal sports person, I like things like motor cycle racing and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, my husband was football, baseball --
L:  Really?
R:  -- of course there's nothing real close to us --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- Buffalo, New York, probably.
L:  Even if you can get there, the -- the cost to go is so expensive.  It's -- it's unbelievable.
R:  And then when you get there you get crappy seats.
L:  Right. [LAUGH] 
R:  And I -- I just -- my feeling has been for a long time if every fan -- say, for a football game today --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if every fan for one month would not go near a stadium --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they wouldn't be getting these millions of dollars.
L:  Yeah.  I mean some of them --
R:  And I realize they get injured, but you can get injured on your job too.
L:  Oh sure.  I got injured, I was -- I -- I did accounting and I got injured moving a potted plant, I mean, I threw my back out and I was off work for two months.  And my back's still -- it's been years, and my back still acts up because of that stupid -- oh, it wasn't just like a little plant, you know, it was like a fifty pound plant that I decided to pick up which was --
R:  Oh I know.
L:  -- but still, you know.  I got hurt.
R:  And I don't think they should strike.  I -- I just think there should be something there when they sign their contracts that say they cannot ever strike.
L:  Yeah.
R:  If they have to take -- 'cause they're getting -- they're getting more than their share.
L:  Oh yeah, they're getting more than ten people's shares, plus --
R:  Plus.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- it's unreal what these guys -- some of those guys get.  I -- I'm just mind boggled by it.  I -- and then there's some, you know, people that do other sports, you know, they barely scratch by by it, you know, with -- I mean, you know -- like even with motor cross -- motor cycle racers used to get zero, basically zero.  I mean, now it's a bigger sport, but when I was --
R:  Well golf used to get nothing too --
L:  Oh yeah, that's right, golf, yeah.
R:  -- I mean everything grows --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and you expect it to grow, but there should be a sealing cap of some sort that says this is the most an athlete can have, you know --
L:  Yeah, I mean, I find it's pretty ridiculous when somebody goes on strike 'cause they're not making twenty five million in a year.
R:  But you -- should you get -- sign a contract and get seven million to sign another year of contracts?  I don't think so.
L:  I don't think so either.  I think it's too --
R:  I think it's greedy and I think if they learn to live in -- within some sort of a -- a means like we have to.  I think some of them need a reality check.
L:  Yeah, yeah.  And they obviously don't have it because of the things that a lot of them are doing, as far as, you know, drugs and all the wacky other stuff that's going on --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- I mean, it's like you give a guy all this money and they don't have a clue what to do with it and I think a lot of them go nuts off the field.
R:  And they're not handling it, yeah.  
L:  No.
R:  Beating their wives and --
L:  Yeah.  I mean --
R:  -- you know, some of them, like the latest things that are going on.  I didn't realize there was a strike at this time.  I -- we always have been big baseball fans --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I'm not so much, but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- my husband has always been --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and my son is too --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and um, but you just -- and of course, I've been in Florida during spring training and I've gone to the games and I see the guys, and they're still making these millions [LAUGH] going down there and having a good time.
L:  I know. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, and if you like to play baseball you go out in the field and play for nothing.
L:  Oh yeah, yeah and it --
R:  And it's interesting.
L:  -- yeah, it's more fun when you have at least -- I mean, it's like watching the Super Bowl, it's such an industry it's not even like a game anymore.  It's -- it's all --
R:  Too commercial.
L:  -- yeah, and it's so manufactured.  If you -- if you make one mistake you're out of the game and if you do this you're out of the game and everything is so choreographed it's -- it's -- it's -- it's almost weird.  It's -- it's not -- it's kind of sur- -- surrealistic or something.
R:  And you have to realize too that a lot of these -- these players are receiving this big money because of the businesses that sponsor it.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  Like Coke Cola and Pepsi.  They put so many millions and millions of dollars into it that you think wouldn't it be nice if they put that into the cancer programs --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and um, cystic fibrosis and things like that.  I mean, it --
L:  Oh yeah.  And Alzheimer's.  I mean, you've got -- you're dealing with something that I -- I've -- I've had that -- my -- my grandmother, um, went through -- went through that whole thing and -- and ah --
R:  And they have no idea.  I mean, um, like I said, I -- I had a factory job and so I had a pretty good retirement --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's not fantastic but my husband farmed for forty years --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- and so he gets like, five hundred and something a month.  Now you think about taking one of those guys and saying --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- "You're going to get five hundred and something a month."
L:  I know, I know.
R:  You know.  I just -- I don't think it's right.  I think the wages are wrong and I don't think they ever should strike.
L:  Yeah, I don't think --
R:  I kind of rank them with teachers.  I feel the same way there, they shouldn't be allowed to strike and I don't think any teacher pregnant should ever start a classroom, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because it's not fair to the kids 
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- and it's the same thing with sports, they should not be allowed to -- to do it.  It just should never be allowed.  And the wages have got to -- there's got to be something pretty soon.  When it costs you, say three hundred dollars -- like, for us to leave here and go to a sporting event in Pittsburgh or Buffalo or two, two and a half, three hours away from those places, if we go, say, my husband and I, and of course our children are grown, I'm in my sixties --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but if -- we had five children and we went one time probably twenty years ago --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and took our five children and three other kids, it cost us a lot of money --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we got up there, we sat way up high in the stadium --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we had asked for good seats.  They were drinking, they were smoking pot, they were attacking the women --
L:  Oh gosh.
R:  -- and it was awful.  I mean it was terrible for me to be there with my children --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you couldn't see the game going and I'm watching them down there seeing guys sitting on the bench making a million dollars and knowing that I took money to go up there that I would need for something else here soon.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I -- I said, people should just stay home and I really believe that.  I think if there was a movement to say, all right, during the month of April or during the month of May, don't anybody go to a sporting event --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just stay home for the whole month.  If you could get the people to do it.
L:  Yeah --
R:  You know --
L:  -- and that would be so -- that's the hard part is getting people --
R:  Even half.  Even if half the people just wouldn't go.
L:  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  It just would really do something.
R:  And why would you go -- it's not just the players there but in order to finance their wages these vendors are charging such horrid prices for a -- a sandwich or a drink.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah, I know, you know, eight bucks for a hotdog.  Unbelievable.
R: You know, you bought for ten cents.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  It's just -- it's just unreal.
R:  I don't know the answer.  I don't know where it can get cut, but I believe with the job cutting today it's time to start cutting down with these sporty -- sports people.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I tend to agree with that.  I -- I don't -- I just don't get it.  I don't get it.
R:  I don't see a way -- I don't see a way to all of a sudden say to someone who is in Michael Jordan's caliber, you can't have this much money anymore --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but there has to be a way pretty soon.
L:  Well what about these guys like Mike Tyson who -- who -- who get millions of dollars for beating somebody up and then go out and rape somebody or -- or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then -- and then they get allowed to go back and do it again --
R:  And do it again.
L:  -- and that just -- I don't -- I totally don't understand the whole situation with that kind of thing.
R:  And of course I -- I believe it is the same there with almost everything in the country today.  Some people are punished and some get off.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That maybe did the same thing.  It kind of is a depend on who you know and you are thing.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, how many bucks you have in your hand.
R:  Yeah.  And that -- that's bad.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I hope there's some way that they can think to -- to get the wages down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ah, to a decent -- something that you would feel like, don't you think um, fifty thousand dollars or sixty thousand dollars a year should be good for these people?  With their insurance caps and their traveling caps --
L:  Well I would think, you know -- yeah I would think that something -- sure -- I -- I used -- you know, I don't know wh- -- I wouldn't have a clue where to set up, no way, but I just can't imagine that anybody's worth what some of these guys are getting and I -- I -- when you're talking ten, twenty million a year for -- I mean -- what is that?  I don't -- I just don't understand it.
R:  Their transportation
