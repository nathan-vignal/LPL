L:  Hi.  My name is Sylvia.
R:  Hi.  Ah, d- -- my name's Elodie[?].
L:  Hi.  This is a -- a much more loaded question than -- than I've gotten [LAUGH] before.
R:  Yeah.  This one's a tough one. [LAUGH]
L:  Um, I don't know.  Middle East peace -- I'm not sure whether that's just, um -- whether they're particularly referring to the Israeli Palestinian situation or just everything over there that just doesn't seem [LAUGH] to be working at all.
R:  No.  I [LAUGH] --
L:  Um [LAUGH] --
R:  I think they're, kinda, talking about the whole --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the whole [LAUGH] situation, you know, between -- within them -- amongst themselves and them and the rest of the world. [SIGH]
L:  Well, I'd -- I don't know.  I think [SIGH] in terms of -- I guess 'cause it's in the news right now -- um, the Iraqi Iranian, kind of, situation, I'm not so sure.  I think we're gonna be over there for a long time.  I hope it doesn't turn into a Vietnam type situation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I think especially with, ah, [SIGH] o- -- I don't know.  Just reading in the news, ah, about them, you know, partially basing going to war on there being, um -- I guess, Iraq purchasing, um, uranium from some unnamed African country and then that's just, kind of, kaput.  Um, [LAUGH] I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It makes -- hello?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] I'm sorry.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Kinda, makes me question, um, a lot of things.  Um, and -- I don't know.  I'd ... [SIGH]
R:  Well, I don't really think that our leadership took us to war for no reason.  I mean --
L:  Well, I'm not saying --
R:  They obviously weren't --
L:  -- no reason.
R:  -- being cooperative and -- and they had agreed to be.  But --
L:  I don't know.  I -- I think that there are a lot more pressing, um, concerns in the Middle East than Saddam Hussein.  Not that he e- -- wasn't a bad guy.  I'm not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it's good that he's gone.
R:  Mm. [LAUGH]
L:  But -- you know, just of all the things going on right now, you know, I would've thought North Korea would've been a lot more pressing, um, in terms of them already having it and saying, you know, kind of, "Why don't you dare us to move?"
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so, I -- I don't know.  I, kinda, feel like we -- I don't know.  I -- I feel like the government f- -- said to flex a muscle somewhere.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I think --
L:  And --
R:  -- that was probably some -- some leftovers from the previous war. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where we didn't, kinda, tidy things up. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  And I'd -- I wish they wouldn't say that the war is over because there's people getting killed.  Our soldiers are getting killed every single day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And -- I don't know.  To say that it's over, kind of, makes it seem like things are being wrapped up and, you know, they're, ah, getting a new form of government together and everything's, kind of, moving smoothly and it's not.
R:  No.
L:  And I -- I wish that they would just say, "You know what?  It's gonna be continuing action.  We need to still keep troops over there" and, you know, I think people think that it's gonna be something that's gonna be over relatively soon and I just -- personally, I don't see that happening.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  It's -- it's worrisome.  I'm worried --
R:  It's, ah --
L:  -- about my little brother and the draft and -- and all of that.
R:  Well, I hope we don't get there. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I hope not.  I mean, I think, as of now, we have, like, a hundred thousand troops out of the country.  Um, I was reading New York Times today --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and, ah, I've -- that's just such a large, um, [MN] quantity of people that we have over there for the size of the army.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  There's -- there's still a lot more a- active people that are -- that can be sent in the, um, National Guard and stuff like that before --
L:  True.
R:  -- I think, they would invoke a draft but --
L:  True.  I don't know.  It just --
R:  It is scary. [LAUGH]
L:  I think that, um -- I don't know.  I'm just -- I'm worried about peace in terms of, I guess, like, the Kurds and the Shiites and, um, the other tribes not getting along.  You know, 'cause they -- they weren't getting along at all the whole time that Saddam was in power over there.
R:  Right.
L:  And the whole way he was, kind of, suppressing it with -- by being this evil dictator person and he was just barely keeping the cap on it.  I'm just, like, oh, it's one more thing that's gonna happen.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, I don't know.  In terms of, ah, Palestinian and Israeli peace, I don't -- I don't know if that's ever gonna happen either.  I think, you know, it's, like, centuries and centuries and centuries of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- these people --
R:  For --
L:  -- not getting along and --
R:  Going on forever. [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  It's -- it's not just a matter of personal conviction.  This is, you know, these religious, um, ideals that they've been holding on to, just, generation after generation.  It's, you know -- it -- it's not something that's gonna be very easily parted with.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, you know, I -- I don't --
R:  When a lot of it's --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- based on the land, which, you know, that's --
L:  True.
R:  Ah, there's no compromise there.  There's only a certain amount of land and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they all want it. [LAUGH]
L:  So -- I don't know.  I used to joke, a few y- years back, that nobody should be able to live in the lands surrounding Jerusalem.  It should be, kind of, run like a theme park.
R:  Mm.
L:  You know [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- just because it's -- it's just too hotly contested and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- everybody has a claim on it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, ev- -- almost every single religion outside of, perhaps, some, sort of, Eastern --
R:  Of Eastern -- stuff like that?  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, Taoism or Buddhism --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- almost everybody has a claim to it.
R:  Yep.
L:  And, um, you know, it's very hard, you know, when people think they're being denied their birthright.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Mm.  That's an interesting idea. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Don't know how you'd ever --
L:  Just an idea.  Just a --
R:  -- convince the world of that but ... [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I -- I don't think it would ever happen.  It was just, you know ...  But [SIGH] -- I don't know.  It's -- it's very sad.  I don't know.  I'm just continually shocked by the fact that we just can't get along at all.
R:  Mhm.  It just --
L:  And --
R:  -- seems to be getting worse too.
L:  Yeah.  And [SIGH] I don't -- I don't -- I don't wanna say I'm losing faith in [LAUGH] humanity --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because of what's been going on recently but -- I don't know.  The way that we deal with it, the way that they deal with it, it just doesn't -- i- it's not gonna come to a head any time soon.  Everybody's got nuclear weapons, nobody's happy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's like everybody's playing chicken and I don't like it at all.
R:  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I yearn for the -- the simpler days.  A- -- even the Cold War with Russia and stuff like that --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- was -- didn't seem so bad. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know, now that you have something else to compare it to, you know?  Ah, [SIGH] -- I don't know.  It's just -- this is such a weird topic to talk about for eight minutes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  'Cause it -- you don't wanna say too much because there's only eight minutes so it's not like you get in a real heated conversation about it.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
L:  But at the same time, you know, you're speaking with somebody that you've, you know -- you don't know, you've never spoken with before.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  Yeah.  Like, they're supposed to be charting, um, [LIPSMACK] the way we speak to each other, the words we use, ah, the tone and the mannerisms.  It's just -- I don't know how they just don't get eight minutes of, um ... ah --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- war is bad.  Mm.
R:  Well, they -- they do come up with some good topics but this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- this one is a tough one and it's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- not one of the ones I would've chosen, that's for sure. [LAUGH]
L:  Not at all.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, jeeze.
R:  But --
L:  I don't know.  I don't think that ...  Like, right now, um, Iraq is under, pretty much, military command and I don't know -- 'cause we're gonna have to be there for a long time to establish a new government and it's going to take a lot of people to make sure that, you know, there isn't mass chaos in the streets the way they were, like, the first few days after -- I think it was, um -- was it March eighteenth or March nineteenth when the war first kicked off and ...?
R:  Something like that.  Yeah.
L:  Um, you know, I -- I can remember watching, ah, the Today Show and it just -- it looks like the cleanest war ever --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in terms of, um, new equipment and they're just driving along and our human -- they made it seem like everything had been captured in two or three days and there wasn't any problems and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know --
R:  Every day was a new victory and just, you know, not too many major incidences and too many Americans dying and --
L:  Yeah.  I can remember thinking, um, the first few weeks, it's, like, the only people that seem to be getting killed are people who're getting killed under friendly fire.
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  So, I was, like, y- you guys need to cap this off.  This is no good.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but now it seems, like, the people, um, [LIPSMACK] -- the people don't like occupation.
R:  No.
L:  So -- I mean, I don't know anybody that really does but --
R:  No.  That's -- I think we're asking for more troubles here with staying over there and --
L:  Yeah.  It's --
R:  -- we need to go away and let 'em run their own country.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] [LAUGH] I don't -- I mean, I -- I don't want it to turn into another situation like what's going on in Haiti right now where, you know, we opposed, um, [LIPSMACK] ye- -- the government and pretty much set in place somebody who, you know, we -- looks like a great guy on paper, was an ex priest and, you know, worked with, um, a- -- the underprivileged and starving children and blah, blah, blah and then, ten years later, he's this, you know, ruthless tyrant killing people because they said something bad about him in the news and we can't get him out and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Things are a hundred times worse now than they were five years ago.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, I -- I don't really know how good it is for us to just come in, you know, b- -- tear everything down and just walk away.  You know, I -- I think it's gonna take a long term occupation like what they did with Germany or Japan after World War Two.
R:  Well, I think to some extent --
L:  So -- and I -- I don't really know whether -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
R:  I think to some extent [LAUGH] we need to trust the countries to take care of themselves though.
L:  True.
R:  I mean, we can't take care of the whole world.
L:  No.  No.  No.  I'm not saying take care of the whole world but in terms of, you know -- it took us a while, as a country, to get our stuff together and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, I -- I --
