L:  Hi, this is Megan.
R:  Hi, my name is Mark.
L:  Hi.  Um, --
R:  Hi.
L:  So I guess the topic is airport security, and if we think it will lessen terrorist attacks.
R:  Yeah, right, exactly.  And, ah, I think that [SIGH], you know, heightened security will reduce airport, you know, the risk of terrorism.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But it won't, it definitely won't eliminate it.  Ah, I think, you know, we've -- we've come a long way but there's still, you know, huge gaps in the system.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, both through, ah, through passengers but, ah, through other methods, you know, as well.  Everybody seems to focus on the, ah, airport check points where they screen passengers and make people take off their shoes and stuff like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [NOISE] But that's only one, you know, aspect of airport security.
L:  Right, and there's ways to get around everything in my opinion even though it might be difficult.  There are still ways that people can -- I mean, you know, like, in nine eleven they -- they had a razor blade and so I'd understand that, you know, they start looking for more stuff like that now since that incident.
R:  Right.
L:  But there's -- there's still -- there's so many different things that you can use as a weapon, you know, and you can't screen it all out.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  I think, you know, actually probably the most -- what's probably going to be more effective, you know, if there's a future incident, you know, a terrorist trying to take over a plane, it's not that they, ah, you know, try to eliminate them from taking some kind of weapons on that they could have taken on before, or that there will be ar- air marshals on the plane, I think it's just that the passengers and the way the crew are going to react is going to be totally different.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Nobody is going to let them, you know, try to actually fly the plane.
L:  Right.
R:  That -- that will be totally different.
L:  Right.
R:  But people haven't, you know, focussed as much on the possibilities of trying to, ah, trying to put a bomb on a plane.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that's, ah, probably, you know, still if you had the technical know how, ah, still probably pretty easy to do.
L:  Right.  Yeah, and it -- it would be possible to get, you know, like, an incendiary device on -- on to an airplane but I think that it's -- it would be more difficult to do that because they do have, you know, those little machines that you have to put your bags through, the x-ray machines that show the inside of the bag.  I understand that there are still some ways that, you know, they might be able to put it together, or screen it somehow.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, yeah, but I -- I don't know.  Like I said, you know, there's always a possibility of anything happening.
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, you -- you try to plan for everything that it is -- it's like an option of happening, but you can't think of everything.
R:  You're not going to be able to, exactly.
L:  Right, so there's -- there's still ways, you know, and I understand with the increased security, they have, you know, up there, um, security on the check points but there are certain ways, you know, people get distracted, there's just so many people going through.  Something could be missed, um, yeah, so there's -- I mean, it -- it can reduce the risk of terrorism if people might want to try less to get something on the plane.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But there are still ways that it can happen.
R:  Right.  And then we also need to think about the, ah, you know, implications of all this extra security.  Eventually at some point, if you have really tight security, ah, you're going to end up driving [NOISE] up the price of, ah, airline tickets or you are going to have it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- subsidized by the government.
L:  Right, because you're going to have to hire all the security personnels and that costs money.
R:  Right.  And I don't think, you know, it's necessarily right that airport security is being paid with somebody's tax dollars who, you know, doesn't fly at all.
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, so, you know, the most logical place to get the money to pay for that is from -- basically from the travelling public.
L:  Right.
R:  But if you increase, you know, ticket prices to such an extent, people are going to start, ah, flying less, and if people start flying less then, you know, there are other implications.
L:  Right, people are going to lose jobs, you know, they're going to have less people just using the services, and if nobody uses the services then why have 'em around?
R:  Right, and then also at the same time you could have, you know, you could -- oh, less people are going to be, ah, travelling so more people will be driving instead, you have more people on the roads.
L:  Right.
R:  You have a bigger chance of, ah, car accidents.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, they stay that still the most dangerous part of travelling of, ah, you know, taking an airplane flight is the drive to and from the airport.
L:  Right.
R:  You're far more likely to, ah, you know, be injured or die.
L:  Yeah, 'cause --
R:  In the car part of it.
L:  Yeah, 'cause there's so many more people driving than -- than flying, you don't have the problem of, you know, planes nose to tail, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  Exactly.
L:  In the airways, so -- so I -- I do believe that the increased security, you know, has reduced the risk of terrorism.  I have noticed on the news every now and then that they have caught people that they have got, you know, suspected of bringing stuff on to do something, but, I don't know, there's -- there's just always a way around everything.
R:  Right.
L:  If it takes a lot of planning, if it takes a lot of people, if it takes a lot of money, there's, you know, there's usually a way around everything and with a lot of the terrorists, they have no regard for, you know, like personal survival, they don't care.
R:  Right, exactly.  So, I mean, that -- that changes the thinking, you know, that security people have to deal with completely.
L:  Right.  Yeah, and so I don't know, and -- and like you said, there are the other implications.  There's the cost, there's people travelling less.  I mean, personally myself, I think that it's a good idea, you know, the security and all that stuff like that, but there's a certain point that it reaches that it just gets ridiculous.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you just get so fed up with it that you don't want to deal with it any more.
R:  Right.  And then, I mean, this country, we tried to, you know, carry out, the security measures so that it's not, ah, you know, you're not profiling people.  You're not trying to stereotype people which, you know, you have and because of that you have ninety year olds, like, grandmothers having to, you know, take off their shoes and everything like that.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  So it's difficult because, yeah, you could, you know, empower the security people to exercise some common sense instead of wasting their time going through this, you know, ninety year old person who it's pretty doubtful that, you know, would be hijacking a plane.
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R:  They could spend that time going through somebody else but then that's, you know, probably an infringement of somebody's, ah, civil liberties.
L:  Yeah, because then you would just be, you know, singling out people instead of treating everybody the same.
R:  Right.  So it's -- it's a definitely a hard -- a hard topic.  You know, there's no easy answer to it and it's not convinced it's going to be solved overnight.
L:  Right, because -- there are so many people that just want to be so stickling about every little detail that they just, you know, you do something like that and they won't drop it, so then you have another problem on your hands.
R:  Right.  Um, so I know, I mean, I think, you know, time will -- unfortunately time will tell whether or not it's been, ah, successful or not successful.
L:  Right.
R:  Um.
L:  Yeah, what -- what's that saying, time is the great equalizer, or something like that?
R:  Mhm, mhm.
L:  So, yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, I'm trying to think what else to say on this --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- on this topic.  I mean, I -- I fly quite a bit, ah, a couple of times a month.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, ah, the new security, you know, it took a little while to get used to.  You can't, you know -- I got to plan a little bit extra time, but, ah, once you're -- you're used to it and you know exactly how the procedure works or whatever --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I know the shoes I wear don't set off the -- won't set off metal detector, you know.  I get through the check point and that's taken my wallet out, I've taken my belt off.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I can usually tell so, but, ah.
L:  Yeah and I --
R:  But, ah, the people who are familiar with the situation, they back up the lines and everything like that.
L:  Right, and see I haven't flown since, oh goodness gracious, like four years ago or something like that.
R:  Okay.
L:  Since like well before nine eleven, so I've not -- I have been in the airport because I was taking out my friend from basic training.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I haven't actually been, like, through a check point on to a plane or anything like that.
R:  Right.
L:  But I -- I personally haven't experienced, you know, the longer lines, the new procedures or anything like that but I have --
R:  Yeah.  I mean, definitely the procedures for example, I fly in and out of Washington on most of my flights.
L:  Oh.
R:  And you can't get up -- you can't get, ah, on or -- you can't sit up, you can't go to the bathroom, you know, during the first half hour or the last half hour of the flight.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, so is that really going to be an effective policy or not, who knows?
L:  Right.
R:  But you can do that into -- but, you know, that's a rule into international airport, but it's not the rule into Dulles Airport which flying time is only about -- it's on the suburbs of DC, but it's only really three minutes away flying time so does that really make any sense or not?
L:  Right.
R:  Ah, who knows.
L:  Right.  And like you said, only time will tell.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah, so I -- I, you know, like I've -- I've heard people complaining about the new security procedures and I guess maybe if I had to go through 'em myself, you know, had to experience the delays, had to experience, you know, people being so suspicious of me that I can't wear my shoes or anything like that, then I might be a little bit more picky about it and need to complain a little bit more, um, but like I said, you know, I haven't flown for maybe four years.
R:  Right.
L:  And it was just, you know, in and out.  There wasn't -- there weren't a lot of long lines, you know, "Empty your pockets, put your bag on here" and then you were done.
R:  Yeah, and they pretty much --
L:  So.
R:  You know, they really didn't look very carefully at all.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, and even initially afterwards, I don't think they were looking that -- that carefully either or because I didn't realize until after I had flown for a while, like six months, that inside my wallet I had this sort of like credit card size, ah
