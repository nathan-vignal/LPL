R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Anne, from Maine.
R:  Hi, my name's Devon, from New York.
L:  Oh [SIGH] [COUGH], okay, the topic is do we feel that these athletes should get high pay.  My opinion is no.
R:  Why do you think that?
L:  [SIGH] Ah, because it started out as a sport for entertainment, and for, um -- for fun --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and now, these people are getting huge salaries, ah, just to play ball.
R:  Right, what's -- [MN] do any sports in particular come to mind?  When you -- when you --
L:  Football.
R:  Football mainly?  Uh-huh.
L:  Baseball -- base-, ah, football first, baseball second.
R:  Uh-huh.  How about basketball?
L:  Basketball -- they -- they have a lot of, ah, high expensive players too, but the football -- I think it seems to be the more dangerous the sport -- actually hockey players in Canada -- I live right on the Canadian border --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they get a huge amount of money.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I think it's pretty much all -- all professional sports.  I guess also, it probably ties into the ones that are televised, a lot --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because things -- because I -- I don't think a lot of professional athletes that are in sports that are not televised, you know, say, for -- you know, for example, oh [MN] -- a good example, track and field -- those athletes don't get paid the huge salaries [inaudible] --
L:  No, they don't.
R:  -- you know, it's not ve- -- it's not televised -- prob- probably, ah, football, basketball, baseball, would be -- would be the main ones.
L:  Soccer.
R:  Sorry -- say it again.
L:  [MN] [COUGH] Excuse me -- soccer and hockey.
R:  Yeah, definitely soccer is getting up there now, since it's -- it's being televised I think more often and there's more popularity in it.
L:  But, as far as the track meets and stuff, um, [MN] --
R:  Yeah, the s- -- yeah, the stars -- the stars do, but I -- the stars in track and field often command high appearance fees, but I don't think the average salary in track and field is n- nearly as high --
L:  No, it's -- no, it's very, very low.
R:  Yeah -- I think there's like a s- -- a six figure minimum for most team sports.
L:  I believe so.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, do you think it's right?
R:  Um, in one sense, no, actually I -- I do- -- I don't, in -- in -- in -- in any -- in any -- in any sense, [SIGH] um, I think it's, you know, it's one thing to develop your potential, and you know, to have, like, if you have a god gif- -- god given talent to have some kind of reward for that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but, then, I do think it's -- it's set up to -- it's -- it's kind of set up -- set up in a warped way, that it makes, you know, that -- I guess, ah, professional sports valued in our society, so much more than many other things are.  And, I think that definitely has a negative effect on kids, and, you know -- what their --
L:  I -- I very much agree.
R:  -- you know, what their -- what their aspirations are.
L:  Because if you have a child in high school, or even grade school --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they like to play softball, or baseball, or basketball, or any of these sports, and, um, if they don't win, then, you know, they're -- they're -- they don't take it very good.
R:  Right.
L:  They're not good sportsmanship.
R:  Right.
L:  And these, ah, schools -- the physical education teachers are -- aren't teaching the children this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And it goes back to the parents and a lot of parents, unfortunately, today don't have the time to sit down and really discuss sportsmanship, manners, and a lot of things that parents should really be doing.
R:  Right, and then in a -- in almost [MN] -- almost like, in a [inaudible] [SIGH] -- in a kind of a -- in the -- in the wrong way, sometimes the athletes become, like, parental figures to these kids.
L:  Right, and all their viewpoints, and all their, um, I don't wanna use the word morals, but, um --
R:  Yeah, no, I would say it, [MN] [inaudible] morals.
L:  -- yeah, I mean, all -- all these things seem to -- if you pick a -- well, I'll -- I'll give you a for instance, which has nothing to do with -- with sports, but, a friend of mine's grandchild said to her, not too long ago, "Well, what was wrong with President Clinton?  Why did that lady get under his desk?".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That -- beca- -- well, you know, that was -- that was terrible, he should have been impeached, I'm sorry --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's the way I believe.
R:  Right.
L:  But, to all the people -- all these kids look up to the president, and to think that, you know, all these kids think that Clinton was the best thing that ever walked, is terrible.
R:  Right.
L:  And it's the same way with all these other, ah, sp- sportspeople -- I'm sorry, that's -- you know, I don't think it's right.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I think, I mean, some people know about it, but in -- I know at least in the Annafeld[?] there are, you know, there's kind of an implicit understanding that it's all right to be, you know, abusive to your spouse, or to be, you know, in possession of drugs, or using drugs, or ...
L:  Yes, especially the drugs part of it.
R:  You know, and then esp- -- then, when somebody comes up, or you know, someone gets, I guess, caught, so to speak, everything -- not that the charges get dropped, but the charges -- they're -- they're viewed in a different way --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- you know?
L:  They're -- they're read in a different way, and if you have enough money, you may be -- be able to get out of it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the layperson that gets in trouble, usually goes to jail, and pays a big fine.
R:  Right.
L:  And, I'm not condoling any kind of drugs, but, you know, it's not right for the -- for the little man down here to get squeezed hard for the same crime as the guy that's got all kinds of money.
R:  Right, exactly, exactly, because people can afford to pay different -- different levels of legal, I guess, different levels of legal fees.
L:  Well, look at OJ Simpson.
R:  Right, exactly, it's a -- that's a very good --
L:  [LAUGH] And that was on TV for how many weeks?
R:  Right.
L:  And so many women, like, I mean, a couple of my friends, were like, glued to the set, I said, "This is crazy, what are you -- why do you sit there and listen to this crap?".
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's fanta- -- it's -- it's interesting, it's fantastic, and I thought, "Gee, sure, you know, I'm -- I'm not ...", I mean, I watch TV some, but I don't watch it like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, I don't watch it for days and days and days for the same old crap.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] But -- this is why we have a world, everybody has an opinion, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, how did you get hooked up with this, ah, um ... University --
R:  Oh, I saw -- I saw an ad on the internet for it.
L:  Where did you find yours to?
R:  Say it again.
L:  Where did you find, ah -- what was the web page that you found it on?
R:  It was on Craig's List.
L:  How do you spell it?
R:  Craig's List.
L:  I'm sorry [MN] -- I don't under- ...
R:  Craig's List dot org.
L:  How do you spell it?
R:  C.R.A.I.G. --
L:  C.R.I.A.G. [MN] --
R:  S.L.I.S.T.  Craig's List dot org, for New York.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, I -- a friend of mine called me, and said that they needed people, um, in -- in the rural -- rural Maine area, with an accent --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- do the survey.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And she said, "Would you be willing to do it?", and I said, "Sure", I said, "I don't care -- for thirty dollars, I'll [LAUGH] -- sure".
R:  Right.
L:  So, ah, and I don't know what the -- but, then a friend of mine s- -- another friend of mine that called me about the same thing, she had seen it [MN], through a research magazine, and of course I do research --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, she said that they needed more males, and I said, "Well ...", I said -- I asked my boyfriend, and he's, "No, [inaudible] I'm not gonna go on and talk to some -- some people about stuff I don't know anything about" --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, [inaudible] he wasn't game to get thirty dollars, but --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I was.
R:  [SIGH] So --
L:  Is this your first --
R:  -- what -- what -- what sports do you f- -- do you follow any sports, or ...?
L:  Um, basically, the baseball --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I mean, because of the, um, Red Socks beating Boston --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- [SIGH] and, ah, Toronto Maple Leaves --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that's hockey, but -- I don't watch 'em very much, I, you know, I look at 'em once in a while, but [SIGH] I'm not a true -- [MN] as my son says, I'm not a true fan.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  He watches, you know, the football and all this other stuff, and he belongs to, um, [MN] Sons of the Legion --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the American Legion, so, all the -- the whole bunch of guys go out there with a big screen, and they all watch that on the, you know -- Superbowl and all this other stuff, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [SIGH] But, I'm not into all that stuff, so ...
R:  Hm.
L:  [SIGH] So, what do you do?
R:  I usually follow track and field, tennis, some --
L:  Tennis, I -- that is something I used to play before my accident -- oh, I'm disabled --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I used to play tennis way back --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, it was -- oh, that was fun, I do -- I do enjoy watching the tennis ch-, ah, championships.
R:  Right, what do you think about those players?  Do you think they deserve as much as they get, or ...?  [MN] I mean, that's -- that's actually kind of different, because that's -- that's pretty -- it's always individual, unless it's doubles --
L:  But --
R:  -- but, even in doubles, it's not nearly as much of a team concept as it is.
L:  Well, the -- the thing is with the tennis though, it's for a title, it isn't for --
R:  Just playing.
L:  Yeah.  And of course, I suppose, if you get technical -- the Red Socks want the World Series, and this one wants this, and this one wants that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, track and -- and tennis, and -- I don't think more of Olympics --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I mean, you know, well, you know, they practice ice skating -- all that kind of stuff.
R:  Right [SIGH].
L:  So, I suppose it's -- as you say, it's -- it's a person's opinion.
R:  [NOISE] 
L:  So ...
R:  So, you did used to play tennis?
L:  Yes, yeah.
R:  Did you play mostly singles, or doubles, or ...?
L:  Ah, singles.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Ah, well, actually, I used to play basketball, I used to play tennis and I used to play softball.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, I used to teach the Catholic, um -- I'm Cath- -- oh, I'm not Catholic now, but I -- anyway, I'm half Catholic, I guess --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- anyway, um, I used to teach, ah, [MN] a Catholic Youth, ah, organisation, so, I used to have, ah, softball ...
