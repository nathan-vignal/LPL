R:  [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Are we s- -- oh, I didn't know.  I thought that the thing was gonna tell us to start talking.
L:  I'm sorry.  I didn't understand.  It wakes[?] me up just what happened. [LAUGH]
R:  Ah, okay.  So, I think we're supposed to talk about airport security.
L:  Right.  But the -- what kind of [NOISE] w- -- what, ah, was the exact question though? [NOISE]
R:  They said --
L:  [NOISE] Do you --
R:  -- do you think that high end airport security prevents terrorism?
L:  Um, what do you think? [NOISE]
R:  Um, I think it does because people have been caught, I mean, with -- with dangerous items.  So, I mean, that shows that they were gonna do something bad.  So, I think it -- I think it does prevent.  I mean, what's the other option?  Just let anyone come --
L:  Right.
R:  -- into the airport and do whatever the hell they want?
L:  Yeah.  But don't you think that it makes it -- they -- you are making it difficult for people to -- to, probably, wanna commit [NOISE] some type of crime like that?  But they will find other means, you know?
R:  Right.  So -- so, fine.  So, then you just let them go through anyway?  You know?  I -- I d- -- I don't know.
L:  I think that regardless, like, they might have airport security and it might be safe and, yes, they go through the whole hassle of, like, [NOISE] taking off your shoes and, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- checking thoroughly your -- your luggage and -- and checking you for that matter and everything --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you have but you could also have anything that you can make into a weapon, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Like, there's --
R:  Right.
L:  There's a way --
R:  Though I mean, the tighter --
L:  -- to make --
R:  The tighter security gets, the worse off -- people are just gonna resort to different measures.  You're -- you're definitely right.
L:  Right.  It's crazy to me though because you're never really safe.  You know?  It --
R:  Exact- -- yeah.  It's very scary.
L:  If --
R:  You're not safe anywhere.
L:  Right.  It's the sense of fear that you have, like, all the -- I mean, I leave my house because you just never know [NOISE] when anything is going to happen. [PAUSE] But, um, [NOISE] as far as --
R:  But I think -- but I think you can't [SIGH] -- you can't stop security in airports.  Especially -- it's too late.  I mean, they've already started doing it.  So, now, if they -- if they stopped, then -- then people would know because they already know the system and everything and if they got rid of it and -- whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  I think that'd be a terrible idea.
L:  Yeah.  They have to continue with the -- like, I know what you're saying.  Like, if they would -- for example, if they would stop security then --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it would just create total chaos.  But rather than that, they have security and as things happen, like, they would m- -- put more measures to, like, prevent more things.
R:  [NOISE] Right.
L:  But there's -- there's always that -- that -- that issue that you're always at risk regardless.
R:  Yeah.  And I mean, I hate to say this but I just think it's gonna get worse.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think we -- I think we have --
L:  I have that --
R:  -- yet to see what's gonna happen.
L:  Right.  Like, we're all -- like, I almost feel like people are just waiting, you know?
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  Like, just --
R:  -- mean, look, they planned the World Trade Center for god knows how long and -- and no- nothing stopped that.  A- and now that they have new weapons and chemicals and -- oh, it's awful.
L:  It just -- it'll continue to different things.  It doesn't even have to be with, like, a building or an airplane.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  It can be other things.
R:  Yeah.  I'm thinking subways, trains and -- I mean --
L:  And that's people's worst fear that you're in the train and something might happen because --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's underground, you know?
R:  Yeah.  It -- oh.  And it's very easy for people to get in.  It's not like -- it's not like they have tight security there now.  They don't have anything.
L:  Right.  But regardless, it's, like, in the airports, like, the type of plotting that people could do is amazing.  You know, like --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- secur- -- there -- there could be people undercover in an airport and you wouldn't even know.  Like, people that probably work for an airline that are probably terrorists themselves --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and planning things and there's also that -- that idea that they should check thoroughly who they're hiring in these airports.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, maybe now they just started doing that but who knows who's already in there?
L:  Even maintenance, you know, things like that.  Or --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- these -- they're -- security themselves could be anyone and we don't even know it and they're the ones that could be, um, pass -- letting these people pass so that things could happen, you know? [NOISE]
R:  So, awful.  Oh, it's just terrible.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  That's a crazy time. [NOISE] But I had no idea that this was like that.  I actually, um, did this online.
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  But I didn't know that I was supposed to have a conversation with someone.
R:  Oh, yeah.  So, the way it works is they -- they time you or whatever.  They want to see how people talk.  I have no idea why or what they're trying to collect [several inaudible words] how people interact, um, so they -- yeah.  It's a -- their system[?].  That's why you probably checked off, like, what hours are convenient for them to call you --
L:  Right.
R:  or whatever?  'Cause they -- they want you to be able to talk for ten minutes. [NOISE]
L:  Oh.  I have --
R:  I've only did -- I only did one other one so I just -- I just remember that's how that one worked.
L:  Oh.  Did you like it?  Like, you --
R:  Yeah.  It was fine.  The first one, we talked about, ah, banning books in schools.
L:  Right.
R:  And I thought it was interesting because I mean, I don't wanna, you know -- I don't think books should be banned inherently and when you start telling people what to do, that's just bad and I think that's just -- can stem to other things.  You know, like, some people can say -- I -- I think it's just, like, a smaller sense, um ... you know, f- -- that's like I'm also very pro abortion so it's like I don't want people telling me what to read, I don't want people telling me, you know, what I can do with my body, that kind of thing.  So, that's why --
L:  Right.
R:  That's why -- granted, that doesn't mean I think that little kids should be reading pornography in school but I'd rather have them say you can't ban anything.
L:  Well, there's -- right.
R:  I just think that's the safest --
L:  There's also that sense that -- there's also that sense that, like, [NOISE] you have to teach your kids, you know, like, this is what --
R:  Exactly.  You shouldn't be looking to the schools to -- to -- to -- to educate your children.  You should be doing that yourself.  If-- if you have a problem, then you should teach that to your child individually.  I mean, [NOISE] -- yeah.  I never really understood that. [NOISE]
L:  That's crazy.  But I guess --
R:  So, yeah.  That -- that was the first topic.
L:  That's interesting that they actually have things like this.  I actually saw it in on Craig's list.
R:  So did I.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] But I didn't even think it was --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- real.  It's just, like, "Oh, they probably won't call me".  Whatever.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Right.  It's bull.  I know, this one actually might be real.  I love Craig's list.  Every time I go to work[?] and the first [several inaudible words].
L:  You and me both.  I think -- me and my friend are obsessed.  Anything we see on Craig's list we're, like --
R:  Y- --
L:  "You saw this ad on Craig's list, for this?"
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  It's so --
R:  Ah, you know I've read some of the craziest personal ads, you know, they put on there.  Unreal what people will post.
L:  Tell me about it.  I have the sa- same --
R:  Do you -- do you -- where do you live?
L:  I live on a Hundred and Thirteenth Street --
R:  Oh, okay.  So --
L:  -- in Manhattan.
R:  Okay.  I live on Ninety Sixth Street so I mean, you -- they don't necess- -- I didn't realize -- you're not even necessarily from the same city, I think, um, during this.  Whatever.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah.  So, the New York ones are ridiculous.  People will request, like, hook ups based on their neighborhood.  It's so crazy to me.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  If you ever go to the, um -- the erotic encounters or something like that, under one of them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my god.  It's crazy.
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my god.  I could imagine.
R:  I mean, it's a good site.  I mean, I've -- I got my air conditioner from it and -- and -- and you can get, like, good cheap stuff, which is fine.  But, oof, it's sad.  Some of it's d- -- oh.  Especially, like, the New York postings.  Oof.
L:  They put the silliest things on there though.
R:  Right.
L:  The silliest, like -- like, I read an ad once, oh, I'm f- -- I'm looking for four twenty or something like that.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's what --
L:  I was, like, "Oh, god". [LAUGH] Like -- like, is that a trap?  Hello? [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Right.  I don't know what people think.  Like, they have no shame putting up the craziest most inapp- --
L:  I swear that I --
R:  -- inappropriate postings.
L:  I know.  But I swear that, like, probably cops themselves put ads like that so they could just find people to, like, bring into jail or something.
R:  I think they're really smart --
L:  For --
R:  -- actually.
L:  For random reasons.  That's what I always think 'cause, like, why would you put an ad like that?
R:  Right.
L:  Unless, it's, like, [NOISE] that you're looking for something.  It's, like, [NOISE] suspicious to me. [NOISE]
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  No.  I hear that.
L:  [NOISE] That is so funny to me.  I was just thinking, like --
