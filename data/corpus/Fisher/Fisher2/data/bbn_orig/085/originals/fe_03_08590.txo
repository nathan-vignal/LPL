L:  [NOISE] Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name's Margaret.
R:  Oh, yes.  Hi.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  My name is Sigrid.
L:  H- -- Sigrid?
R:  And I'm from Staten Island.
L:  I'm from Baltimore, Maryland.
R:  Oh.  Hi. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] H- how are you?
R:  Ah, very nice.  Yes. [MN]
L:  Well, h- -- [NOISE] um, I, [NOISE] um, [NOISE] h- ho- -- could you a- -- [NOISE] ah, wait [NOISE] -- Chris, [NOISE] I'm on the phone please. [NOISE] Um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I, um, [NOISE] [LIPSMACK] really have very ambivalent feelings [LAUGH] about the Middle East.
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] I, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really wonder if [NOISE] those part of, um, [LIPSMACK] biblical, ah, scripture [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  [MN]
L:  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] I really am a- -- I really don't feel that we should be involved.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I -- my -- I was [NOISE] very against Bush.
R:  Mhm.
L:  My -- my, ah, initial reaction was, you know, well --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we're gonna go over there and we're gonna stomp 'em and [NOISE] wipe 'em out.  Well, what's to say that -- li- like he's doing now with Libya?  Okay, well, we're gonna leave the Middle East and now we're gonna go to Libya. [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  What's gonna happen that -- he's not gonna then go to Canada or he's --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- gonna go to China or --
R:  I -- I --
L:  -- go to a --
R:  I think he plans on going, um, to a lot of different places, like you say, and that I think it just, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very eruptive, you know?  And a lot of problems.  And, like a- -- you also said, I d- -- I wasn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for it at all.  You know?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  For going over there and, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- starting a war and so forth.  No.
L:  I mean, I -- I don't [NOISE] wanna, like, [NOISE] push my -- my religious beliefs on you --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- again, like I said, I'm wondering about the, um -- being the biblical scripture and [NOISE] I mean, like I said, with -- with him saying, "Okay, we're gonna [NOISE] go here and we're gonna do this" and, like I said, now going to Liberia and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] It --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- makes we wonder -- I mean, there [NOISE] -- you know, a- again, going back to biblical scripture, [NOISE] could he be [LAUGH] the anti Christ?
R:  Yes. [MN] That's --
L:  [NOISE] Y- --
R:  That's really --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- interesting that you --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- should say that because I -- I was also --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- thinking that, you know?  But I didn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I didn't know whether, ah, I should say anything.  But I really think that he is the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- either the forerunner --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- of that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- coming --
L:  I -- I mean --
R:  -- you know?
L:  And -- and that ma- -- [NOISE] -- I mean, because it ma- -- I mean, it's, like, f- -- [NOISE] I don't think that [NOISE] -- ah, I didn't think that the anti Christ was [NOISE] supposed to come from [NOISE] the United States.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- th- that's w- -- [LAUGH] what's got --
R:  You always thought it would be the Middle East --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- right?  Or --
L:  Exactly.
R:  Mhm.
L:  A- and that's just got me confused but yet --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, it's, like, [SIGH] I -- I --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- just --
R:  Well, it -- it's, ah, you know --
L:  He -- he just --
R:  Yeah.  I understand what you mean.  I -- I always thought that too and we don't like to think that it would come from this -- this country, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  No.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Not at all.  But sometimes, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if, you know, we don't know what the interpretation is. [LAUGH] You know?  'Cause i- -- ah, read something and then, ah, just, ah -- a- and not realize --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that there's more to it, you know, in the Bible and so forth, that we're, maybe, not interpreting in the correct way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that -- that's quite possible that it -- i- -- instead of the Far East, like I always thought --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it could be right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from here and, um --
L:  Mhm.  Exactly.
R:  [MN]
L:  And -- and it -- like I said, it just [NOISE] -- I just -- you know, listening to everything that, I mean, h- -- listening on the news and everything that's happening --
R:  Yes.
L:  It [NOISE] -- you know, it  -- it definitely -- I mean, our -- our church --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] ah --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the -- the pre- -- the minister at our church --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I know, two years ago, said that he really believed -- and even on TBN --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- said that they believed that the [NOISE] -- this is definitely the end times.
R:  Oh, yes. [MN]
L:  This is definitely --
R:  Yes.  It is.
L:  -- the end times.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my husband has al- -- has said -- he said, you know -- he said, ho- -- w- -- he said, "You don't have to worry about me dying or about me be- being buried or anything".
R:  Mhm.
L:  He said, "I'm gonna be rapture" he said, "Before --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- anything happens" he said.  So --"
R:  Oh, yeah.  Mhm.  Oh, yeah.
L:  You know?  So, you -- you think [NOISE] -- you listen to what's going on and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, they even said the other day ta- -- um, something about talking of peace on the -- in the Middle East and it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just, like [NOISE] -- you know, it's just, like, everything is [NOISE] coming together and it just --
R:  Yes.  It is.
L:  [NOISE] You know?
R:  I agree with you.
L:  And I just [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, ah --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's what I feel, very much so.  It's very close, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to -- these are the end times.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know?  And, um -- I'm just so shocked at some of the things that I see and hear just, ah, you know, with, ah, normal, everyday, ah, behavior of people. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, let alone, you know, the -- the wars and so forth.  And that's all we hear about is this --
L:  [NOISE] M- --
R:  -- this -- one war after the other.
L:  Mhm. [NOISE]
R:  And, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it doesn't --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- seem to bring any kind of peace.
L:  No.
R:  But -- and it is -- it might seem that way for a little while but then it -- it goes back to the same -- same thing.  It's just, like, people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- can't stay on a steady course of -- of being peaceful and have a -- a good understanding with one another and so forth.  No.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know?
L:  No.  I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I, um --
R:  Yeah.  So ...
L:  I -- I definitely did not have good feelings when [NOISE] -- when that whole -- you know, like I said, when he first said we were sending people over.  And --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, it's, like [SIGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, m- my [NOISE] -- I don't know.  Like I said, my f- feeling was, why? [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Why do we need to get involved? [NOISE]
R:  That's right. [MN] They -- they, ah -- their customs over there, in every way, is so different than ours.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And we can't ex- -- you know, go over there.  They have no respect for our lifestyle over here, you know?  For the most part.  And, [LAUGH] ah -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- t- to -- they feel that we're --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just invading them and wanna, ah, tell them how to live and to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- live like we do --
L:  [NOISE] over here [NOISE] --
R:  -- you know?  Have the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- American --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- un- -- and that simply --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that would even create a bigger --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- war in the future.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They d- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- do not want that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- it's, ah --
L:  Yeah.  Like I said, it just [NOISE] -- like I said, it just [NOISE] -- it makes me wonder why --
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- would -- ah, because, like I said, [NOISE] to say, [NOISE] "Okay, we're gonna go over there and we have to get involved.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't like the way they're taking care of their life so I'm gonna get involved --
R:  Right.
L:  "-- with it".
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Well --
R:  And it just doesn't suit them at all.  They -- they really don't want us over there.  You know?
L:  And then, like I said, so then you're always gonna do the same thing with what -- well, w- -- now, we're gonna go to -- to Liberia and --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  M- -- I mean, my question is what's gonna be next?  What is --
R:  M- --
L:  -- gonna stop [NOISE] him?
R:  Yeah.  I- it just won't.  It will just keep on escalating.
L:  Because a- according to him [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, according to Bush --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the United States is all powerful and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nothing can stop him.
R:  Uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  You know --
R:  Well --
L:  -- at first it was --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, at first it was, like, "Well, his father started this war and he had to end it".
R:  Yeah.
L:  Was the --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- first impression.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But then it was more, "Now I just think I wanna be in control".
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE] And -- and that's --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what -- I [NOISE] -- I mean, my husband says, you know, I'm anti American to say this about him [NOISE] but I'm not anti American --
R:  No.
L:  -- I'm just --
R:  No.  You have a right --
L:  -- anti Bush.
R:  -- to your opinion and --
L:  I'm anti war.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- see the reason for it.
R:  No.
L:  I mean, granted the -- they were having --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- problems [NOISE] but let them handle it themselves.  Let them [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  You know? [NOISE] Ah, h- --
R:  Right.  Mhm.
L:  A- -- i- -- a- --
R:  That's right.
L:  You know, those -- those weapons of mass destruction, quote --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- unquote, that were never found --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- were there for years.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Right.
L:  Who's to say that he was -- granted, he could have aimed them here at the United States.
R:  Oh, sure.  Mhm.
L:  But he [NOISE] wasn't.  He was not --
R:  No.
L:  -- bothering anybody here.
R:  No.
L:  You know?
R:  [MN]
L:  It's --
R:  No.  That's right.  He wasn't.
L:  So --
R:  So --
L:  -- I just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I --
R:  I guess the -- the next step would be, what?  Um, in, um, do- -- what is it?  In Japan or in, ah, Korea --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- or ...?
L:  Yes.  Korea.
R:  Yes.
L:  That's probably -- and -- that -- that's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Yeah.  After Liberia, that's --
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  -- I have heard rumors --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- of -- of --
R:  And that's --
L:  -- Korea.
R:  -- where the danger is.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because they definitely don't want us there --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they do have, ah [MN] -- ah, nuclear power aimed towards this country.
L:  Right.
R:  Right?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And -- and he [LAUGH] --
L:  I've -- would think -- no.
R:  If -- if we were to have a war, I mean, Iraq wasn't set up like that at all.  You know?
L:  And see, my [LAUGH] -- I -- I was, like -- with -- with this war --
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I mean, [NOISE] they were sending troops over and setting up in Iraq --
R:  Yes. [MN]
L:  -- for months before they did anything.
R:  Mhm.  Yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That's true.
L:  Now, I can't imagine [NOISE] anybody coming to the shores of the United States [NOISE] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or to Canada or to South America, and setting up for a war.
R:  Right.
L:  And we're just gonna sit there and let 'em do it.
