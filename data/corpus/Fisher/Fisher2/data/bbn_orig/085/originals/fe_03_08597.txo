L:  Hi.  I'm Kelly.
R:  Hi.  I'm Gladys. [PAUSE] Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH] Sorry. [LAUGH]
R:  That's okay.  So, do you think there'll be peace in the Middle East?
L:  I don't think that there will ever be peace there.
R:  I don't think so either.  I think it's getting really out of hand and I think the Israelis have given up so much.  How much more can they give up?
L:  I know.  I just think that people are so passionate about their religious beliefs and they can just get so emotional over it and -- and --
R:  Well, they're very fanatic.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know, it's not even about religious beliefs.  They just don't wanna see Israel exist at all and, ah, you're dealing with people who aren't rational or sane or people you can communicate with and they make one promise and then they do another thing.
L:  I know.
R:  So, I think it's very -- I -- I -- [NOISE] it's a really a tough situation.
L:  I think that they just have a totally different set of beliefs and I don't even think they believe in peace.
R:  No, they don't.  They just -- y- you got these people who enrage them, they get paid for blowing themselves up and their family gets money.  I mean, it goes so far that I don't know how there'll ever be peace there.  Where do you live, by the way?
L:  Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, have you ever been to Israel?
L:  I haven't.
R:  Or the Middle East?  Oh.
L:  But, I mean, I live in a very highly, um, [LIPSMACK] -- well, there's a lot of Israelis, ah -- in this area, actually.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Not huge fanatical ones.  They're just --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, pretty peaceful people.  But, um -- um, a lot of my, you know -- people that I know have been there.  Have you been there?
R:  Yes, I have.
L:  What is it like?
R:  I -- I'll --
L:  I mean, I can't even imagine.
R:  -- tell ya -- I, ah -- it's -- well, I was there about thirty years ago and they always had problems because I remember even when we went to go in to see these special tombs they had all guards.  But it was so beautiful.  The people so -- were so warm and wonderful.  I remember I didn't have a hotel -- 'cause I was traveling around Europe for two months and one of my last stops was Israel.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I didn't have a place to stay and I was walking on the street and, ah, someone said, "Oh, are you looking for a place?"  I said, "Yes".  She said, "Oh, I know someone.  Go there".  It was a beautiful, safe time and you didn't have to worry about getting on the buses.  There was always problems but not -- I mean, now, I would never go there.
L:  Yeah.  I know.
R:  I mean, and they've lost so much money in tourism.  I would be scared to death.  At that time, you know, there was always problems but they the Red Sea and it's just -- and what you saw when Israel took over the land that the Arabs had, what Israelis did with it and they gave the people jobs.  You said, "You know what?  Thank god that the Israelis took it over".
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because it was such a wasteland.  It was just wasted.  People had jobs, it was civilized, they made the kids go to school and it was just a beautiful, beautiful place.  It was really wonderful.
L:  Wow.
R:  And that's how I'll always remember Israel.  I mean, now they've given up so much I've -- it could never be like that again.
L:  I mean, I know so many people who are -- you know, wanna go back there just because it's, you know, their heritage and everything and it just -- but they get so scared 'cause, you know, I mean, it seems --
R:  Yeah.  It's very frightening.
L:  -- safe when you're walking around sometimes but then --
R:  I couldn't go back.  I'd be too frightened.  In fact, one of the hairdressers who I go to is Israeli and he said, "No, it's nothing.  It's safe.  You can go back".  But it's not safe.
L:  No.
R:  I don't think so.  Because when you sit in a cafe and you have to worry is some neurotic person going to get on with a bomb, because lives mean nothing to them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and blow themselves up?  That's what's so, you know -- these radicals.
L:  I mean, that could totally happen.  It happens all the time. [NOISE]
R:  Yes.  Absolutely.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it's so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um -- I don't know what's gonna happen there.  There'll never be peace.
L:  No.
R:  Ah, but they wanna make, like, ah, Palestine but I think even if they give the lands to the Arabs -- and they have in Palestine -- I think that they don't want the Israelis to exist at all.  M- -- and that's the problem.
L:  I don't think so either.  I d- -- I -- I totally agree with you.  I would love to go over there and experience the different cultures but it's -- I would --
R:  You wouldn't wanna go now.  Trust me.
L:  I wouldn't --
R:  It'd be too frighten- --
L:  -- think I would go in any, sort of --
R:  No.
L:  -- future.
R:  I would never go now.  I just would never put myself in that, kind of, a situation.  I m- -- that you can't tour, you can't see anything.  Because they gave up the Golden Heights, the Red Sea.  I mean, there's such -- I stayed at a kibbutz that was so fabulous.  I'll never forget it, the way the people lived.  I mean, the closeness, the sharing, was just so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- phenomenal and now they don't even have that kibbutz anymore.  They had to give that up.
L:  That is just --
R:  And, you know --
L:  -- so sad.
R:  Yeah.  It's very -- oh, [SIGH] god, I tell you.  But I think Bush is doing a good job.  I think he really is trying.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um, it's -- I mean, you know --
L:  There's only so much you can do. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  You're right.  Absolutely.  There's only so much you can do and, um, after that, I mean, who knows what's gonna happen, like, in ten years down the road?
L:  I mean --
R:  Bec- --
L:  -- we can't -- like, we can't do -- there's only so much we can do.  They -- they have to be there for themselves and so many of their citizens just a- -- don't even want the peace.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's the problem.  And, you know, besides tourists not going there, they're losing so many Israeli soldiers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  People are getting killed like crazy.  And our soldiers going into Iraq -- I'm worried about that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, these poor young fellas go in and some of them will never come home.
L:  I know.  I hope that it is over soon.
R:  Oh, [SIGH] god, I tell you, it's just a horrible situation.  What is the world coming to?  Since September eleventh --
L:  I know.
R:  -- everything has gone so crazy and security and people are checking and looking and it's just --
L:  I still can't --
R:  -- it's just not a good time. [NOISE]
L:  -- believe September eleventh even happened.
R:  [MN]
L:  I mean, just the --
R:  Well, I'm in New York and trust me --
L:  Oh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- really?
R:  Yeah.  I live right in Manhattan.
L:  Oh.
R:  And --
L:  My, ah, a- -- [LAUGH] a- --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- aunt was two weeks from moving away when it happened.
R:  Ah, really?
L:  She wasn't hurt or anything but, um --
R:  Ah, well, let me tell you, people can never realize what went on in New York.  I had a l- -- you know, ah, they -- we just didn't know what happened.  And I used to work [NOISE] in an office where I saw the second bomb hit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the second plane, rather, hit [NOISE] and it was devastating.  You thought you were watching a film.
L:  I bet.
R:  People were walking on the streets not knowing.  Everyone was in such a daze.  They told you to go straight home. [NOISE] Oh, [SIGH] I would never want to experience that again.  And it took -- and I haven't been down to the World Trade Center since it happened.
L:  Oh, you haven't --
R:  B- -- ah --
L:  -- gone?
R:  I can't bring -- I can't bear -- would you believe me?  I can't bear to go down there.  It was so sa- -- it's -- I was in such, like, deep mourning after it happened.  I couldn't -- I can't bear to go down there.  It was such a beautiful building.  I used to go there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It was such a lovely area.  They had beautiful shops downstairs where I used to shop and nice restaurants and I just can't bring myself to go back.
L:  I remember it --
R:  So, I haven't been down.
L:  It was just such a tribute to a- -- so many different cultures being in New York, I remember.  Just -- it seemed so --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- amazing 'cause it -- there were just so many different companies that came together there.
R:  You're right.  A lot of different [NOISE] companies, shops and offices and -- oh, [SIGH] I can't believe it.  You know?  He didn't know how successful he was in doing that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because New York has been so devastated.  Companies are going out.  A lotta stores are closing, business isn't good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, [SIGH] it's just horrible.  Really, really horrible.  We still haven't recovered from it.
L:  I went down there -- I -- well, I visited in October -- I visited my relatives -- and I went down there and, I mean --
R:  What'd you think?
L:  Oh, man.  I mean, you just --
R:  I can't go down there.
L:  You -- you just ha- -- to stand there and just cried for a- --
R:  I cried for days.
L:  I mean, just that it's, like, unbelievable.  Unbelievable.
R:  All those innocent lives.  God.
L:  I can't imagine being --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in there and knowing that you couldn't get out.
R:  Oh, that had to be the worst.  People jumping and, you know, my -- I -- everyone knows someone.  My girlfriend's son has a best friend that he grew up with who was lost in the World Trade --
L:  Oh.  That is just so sad.
R:  Oh.  The crying the -- what was going on in the city i- -- they had pictures, if you know anyone, please try to look, try to tell us.  And people praying, "Please god, let these people be alive.  Let them be saved".  But it was -- when you saw the devastation, you realized they couldn't be.
L:  Oh.
R:  It was just a- -- this is a very bad time now and all because of these fanatical people.
L:  I just think that they are wrong to think that they can --
R:  They're crazy.  It's not even -- they don't even know right from wrong.  Th- they -- I mean, they have an article in the Times.  They get these poor kids, they tell them they're gonna go to heaven, there's gonna be Allah.  It was a -- written who- -- l- -- whole article in the Times.  They tell them they'll pay them a hundred dollars, they'll take care of their pa- -- family for life if they go out and they have a bomb on them.  They think Allah is, like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a place in heaven that's, like, the best place to be.
L:  [NOISE] Oh.
R:  You know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're uneducated, they're ignorant, they're poor, they have no money.  They don't know what's happening.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  They're brainwashed and, um, this is the repercussions of wa- -- when you have leaders in there that brainwash the people who live there.
L:  And people will almost believe anything sometimes.
R:  Anything.  You're right.  They'll just believe anything.
L:  It's --
R:  It's very --
L:  -- just so sad.
R:  It's a very sad, you know, terrible time.  How do you like living in LA?
L:  It is, um, different. [LAUGH]
R:  Have you been there long?
L:  About five years.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where did you live before?
L:  I'm from South Carolina.
R:  Mm.
L:  And I moved here to go to USC.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
L:  So, I went to US- -- ah, U- -- it's -- it was a great school and -- and just wonderful and --
