L:  Jeff.
R:  Hi, I'm Lisa.  How you doing?
L:  I'm doing pretty well, how are you?
R:  Good, where are you calling from?
L:  I'm driving back to Chicago, right now.
R:  Oh, from where?
L:  Detroit.
R:  Oh, okay.  Were you having, like, family back there, or fun, or --
L:  Well, I live in Detroit, --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but I'm going to school in Chicago, so, that's --
R:  Wow, how far is that?
L:  Four and a half hours.
R:  Argh!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you do that every weekend?
L:  Oh, no --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I just went home --
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause my mom -- my mom had surgery, so I came home.
R:  Is she okay?
L:  Yeah, it was just, like, varicose veins, so --
R:  Oh, oh, that's -- but it went well?
L:  Yeah, it did.
R:  Oh, that's good, um, I live in Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay, where at?
R:  Um, Quakertown.  It's about half an hour north of Philly --
L:  Okay.  No, I don't know where that is.
R:  -- if you know where --
L:  No.
R:  You know the Billy Joel song "Allentown"?
L:  [LAUGH] Sort of. [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's, that's even closer.  It's about fifteen minutes away. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I'm poolside with the kids, so if I [LAUGH] get distracted for a minute that's why. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, yeah, so, what do you think about --
L:  The Middle East?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm kind of glad, we're all anti war to begin with, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I don't know, I don't think peace will ever be obtained, at least not through our current way of doing it.
R:  I agree, and I -- and, you know, I -- I believe that the role of the US, as noble as it is, I don't know, you know, that we really have the right to impose our, you know, idea of the ideal on everyone else.
L:  Yeah, I don't know.  I think this war was actually kind of valid in the fact that the UN would be considered bullshit if it just keeps on, you know, putting out sanctions, and then, if they don't follow them, not, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- no action is taken.
R:  That's true, that's rue.
L:  So, that was the one positive thing I saw from this war, but, like, just how it's carried out, and all the peacekeeping, and the setting up of the new government, it's really not going to do anything.
R:  Well, and much less, you know, friends of mine, whose, you know, fathers and -- and husbands are gone, and now they're saying it's going to be four years that they're going to be in Iraq, probably.
L:  Yeah, sounds likely.
R:  [SIGH] You know, that's a huge personal toll.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  Well it also helps us out, too, to have, like, an occupied country in the Middle East, just 'cause it's a volatile area, --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, it's not like an incredibly waste- -- ah, incredible waste of money, because of, --
R:  True.
L:  -- with Iran developing missiles, --
R:  Yeah.  Everybody.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  India, they say, has, you know, nuclear capabilities, and all that stuff, too.
L:  Yeah, but I- Iran's just so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- more of a volatile nation.
R:  Yeah, that's the scarier one.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so, --
R:  [LAUGH] Um, yeah, I guess I look at it also pretty personally, you know, from friends and neighbors, and, uh, you know, think, jeez, I, and for my own children, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't, you know, do you have any friends who are over there? [MN]
L:  No, I don't.
R:  I -- I don't to ever see my sons go to war --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and my husband is completely the opposite, he's, like, "You know what, is, this is a great country", he's from Ireland, so, it's like, you know, he's chosen to come here and recognizes what a great country it is, and, you know, I -- I kind of take it for granted, just growing up here, and so, now, I'm kind of like, I don't want to pay that ultimate price with my children's lives.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  But he would, in a heartbeat.
L:  Ah, --
R:  So, -- ah, [LAUGH] I have mixed feelings and I don't -- I also, wonder, you know, we're jumping from the Middle East, and now, you know, they're -- we're talking about going into Africa, and, you know, how much of a policeman are we going to be?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, you can only expand so much.
R:  Right.
L:  At least with our current capabilities.
R:  Right, and we're spending all of our, you know, war budget, which is not going to help the economy any, --
L:  Well, I -- I don't think that really has much to do with the economy, I don't know, --
R:  You don't?
L:  -- I think the economy is based on consumer spending, more or less, and just, like, I don't know, the idea, and, like, the rationale behind investing, and that's what drives the economy --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- rather, rather than, like, policy, and I don't know, I don't think the President has much to do with how the economy's running.  Interest rates play a big part, but, there's, like, a huge fluctuation, huge variables, that aren't taken into account with the interest rates, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, --
R:  Well, I think that's part of it, but also, where's the money coming from for the bullets that they're going to send with -- and the bombs that they're sending with everybody who's going over to Africa now?
L:  Yeah, it sounds like it's true, but [inaudible] --
R:  [LAUGH] Got to be coming from my tax dollars somewhere.
L:  Yeah, it also stimulates the economy in terms of national defence research so, so, I don't -- it's too [inaudible].
R:  True.-- the, I mean, I agree that that's true to -- to a point, um, but I also see it kind of borrowing off of -- and I'm sure you're, you know, feeling the expense of how much college costs nowadays.
L:  Yeah, definitely.
R:  You know, my oldest is ten, my youngest is one, am I going to be able to put four kids through college?  No way!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  No way.  I -- and it's not going to get any cheaper.
L:  Yeah, doubt it.
R:  And I certainly don't plan that, you know, social security's going to take care of me, at all, when I want to retire, you know, --
L:  No.
R:  -- so, I think that part of the military budget is coming out of money that could be going towards -- and I know I'm speaking really selfishly, but -- money that could be going towards money that I could retire on, if it went into social security, or money that could help pay my children's way through college.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, [MN] but, then again, y- -- and I'm, I'm also, you know, a -- a conscientious objector, but I also agree that if we let the Al Qaeda's run rampant in the world, well. they're just going to keep bombing us, and that's not okay either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I want it all.  [LAUGH] I want -- I want to have my cake and eat it too.
L:  'Cause, like, I think the war in Iraq cost as much to us as the bombing of the World Trade Center, the, like, the destruction of it, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, ah, --
R:  You mean in terms of money, or -- yeah --
L:  Yeah, well, in terms of losses, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just because, like, consumer spending, and, like, the economy, [MN] went into a huge recession after the World Trade Center went down, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, and then, like, the actual, physical cost, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, --
R:  What are you majoring in?
L:  What major?
R:  Yeah?
L:  I'm mechanical engineering.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Ah, --
R:  What did you want to go into in the future?
L:  Ah, nanotechnology, maybe.
R:  Nanotechnology?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, interesting.  What is that?
L:  It's like a construction of various stuff at, like, the nanometer level --
R:  Which is small, I'm assuming.
L:  Yeah, it's, ah --
R:  [LAUGH] Okay!
L:  -- like, the size of an atom, basically.
R:  Is it -- um, does it apply in all areas, or is it mostly like, in energy, like, in nuclear, or the --
L:  Um, --
R:  -- medicine, or all those things.
L:  -- it's -- they make a lot of bioengineered parts through nano, um, I'm trying to think of an example, --
R:  That's okay! [LAUGH]
L:  I think I'm getting bad service, here.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Ah, I just went through, like, just a bad part.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, yeah, you take, like, a bioengineered part, it'd be something like, c- -- you can make pacemakers the size of atoms and stuff like that, or, like, you can --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- make stem cells, or, like, stem cell research is big, that's not so much in nano, --
R:  I was going to say, well, we have our, um, our youngest child, we saved his stem cells when he was born, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and we're banking it and paying for it just on the off chance that we would ever need it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Amazing how that stuff is available to us now.
L:  Yeah, this is my fault.
R:  Huh?
L:  I'm going through, like, kind --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- of a mountain area.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Ah --
R:  I can still here you, in and out, though, it's not bad.
L:  All right.
R:  Um, so, what year are you --
L:  Unfortunately --
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  -- I don't know a lot about nano, 'cause I haven't had any classes in it, but --
R:  Sorry, I can't hear you at the moment.  But I'm holding on.  And when you come back, tell me, um, how many years --
L:  No, not at all.
R:  Oh -- there you are.  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.
R:  Um, what, uh, year are you in school?
L:  I'm going to be a sophomore next year.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, --
R:  And are you taking summer classes now, I'm assuming?  Well, I think I'm losing you again.
