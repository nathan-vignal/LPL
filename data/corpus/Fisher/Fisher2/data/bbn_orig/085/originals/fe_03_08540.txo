R:  Hi, ah, my name is Corrine.
L:  Hello Corrine, my name is Rosie -- how are you doing?
R:  Doing all right -- doing all right.
L:  Is this, ah -- you've done other ones of these?
R:  What's that?
L:  Have you done any other of these surveys?
R:  Yes, I have, yeah, that's the third one [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, the third one?
R:  Mhm.
L:  This is my second one -- I did one, like, about [SIGH] ten days ago --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, ah, have you gotten paid?
R:  Ah, no, but they sent me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- an email regarding that, so --
L:  Oh, they did?
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay -- so you think you will get paid?
R:  Ah, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I have not gotten anything, but that's okay.
R:  All right.
L:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about airport security?
R:  [inaudible] sec- -- yeah, mhm, and whether --
L:  Do you travel a lot?
R:  Ah, well, I wouldn't say a lot, but, I regularly get on a plane, ah, pretty much like, one or twice a year --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- at the minimum.  Do you travel at all?
L:  Yes, actually I travel quite a bit, at least a coupla times a month.
R:  Okay.
L:  I just got back from a trip, ah, Thursday actually, I came from San Francisco.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I don't know, I guess after September eleven, it did get kinda tight --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- maybe I noticed it more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because of what had happened.
R:  Sure, sure -- did you notice any special measures for instance on your flight to and back from San Francisco?
L:  Well, you know, I -- different airports are different -- it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, for example, I notice [MN] -- in -- [MN] Miami is -- is where I call home, I guess --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- even though I'm in Huston right now -- I find the airport in Miami, for some reason, I don't know -- it seems to be a little bit more tight security --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- than I've seen, like, Atlanta, ah -- the one here --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- the one in San Francisco -- maybe 'cause Miami's more of a international, um --
R:  [SIGH] Ye- --
L:  -- gateway.
R:  Yeah, I guess so, [inaudible] I -- actually, I don't fly in to Atlanta, ah, very often, but I know that they have a lot of international flights --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- coming into Atlanta, and leaving from Atlanta.
L:  Yes.
R:  Which -- the thing that, ah [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- now that I think about it -- the thing that really blows my mind was that [SIGH] I, ah -- I don't know whether all the measures that they've been trying to implement in terms of security in airports have actually helped with terrorism at all -- [inaudible] but, there was one thing that just blew my mind -- I remember that [MN] ah, on the plane, coming in to the US, we would have an extra, like, half hour of searches and questioning of all kinds, [SIGH] and what was funny was that, ah, on the other leg of that trip -- that is returning -- leaving America --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there was no security measure whatsoever, that was applied.
L:  So, if you were, like, flying from London, let's say, or somewhere in Europe --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to over here, you noticed that there was a lot more --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- questions.
R:  Mhm, but on -- the other way around -- flights originating from the US and going back to Europe, since this is where I travel most of the ti -- [MN] most of the time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- there was basically no security whatsoever -- it was an American company operating the flights, but, there was nothing comparable to what we have -- we had to go through, ah, the other way around, and it just kind of struck me as, like, okay, basically you care if it explodes in your country, but not --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- exactly if it explodes in somebody else's country, even though it's one of your plane -- I don't know, it was just odd -- it was just odd, but, um, I don't know, I've seen a -- I've seen some people getting really aggravated at the security measures that they've been trying to implement, I -- I guess that sometimes they're just being a bit too aggressive.  [SIGH] I don't know if you've had any, ah, brush with customs officers [LAUGH] that were a -- a bit too zealous in their job, or not, but it -- it -- it's seems to be happening around the country every now and then [SIGH], and, ah --
L:  Um, yeah, maybe they treat you different if you don't have a US passport, um --
R:  [SIGH] Yeah, I g- -- I --
L:  -- that could be [LAUGH] ...
R:  -- I guess so, but, ah -- ah, I -- I've seen people who were actually American citizens ah -- ah ... which I guess, you know, to some extent is reassuring, it's like, well, they do not only, ah -- ah, how could I put that -- they do not only, ah, search --
L:  Harass?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- or harass, sure [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, I mean, maybe they don't only harass, you know, people based on the way they look, you know, some kind of like, racial profiling or passport profiling, if that can be, I mean -- they really seem to be applying the same kind of measures to just anybody [SIGH], and as I said, I've seen American people [SIGH] really get aggravated over that, and I remember, um, hearing over, um, MTR --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, that -- that woman was calling it -- it was quite recently after, ah, nine eleven, ah, she was calling it and she was explaining how, ah, she actually got to see her husband being threatened by a guard in an airport with a gun, because he had passed under the security, ah -- the security, what you call that?  The security lines, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  That kind of [several inaudible words] --
L:  He was cutting in line.
R:  Yeah -- t- --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to give something to his wife, that she had forgotten, and apparently he really tried to do that, as, I mean, you know -- he didn't want to come across obviously as somebody who was trying to sneak something into somebody's bag, you know, I mean he was really clear with calling his wife, next thing you know, there's [inaudible] guard, who basically and just was pointing at him with a gun, and [SIGH] the woman on the radio was saying that it had been like, quite, I don't know -- she was like, pretty much annoyed over the whole matter [SIGH] -- I don't know, I've heard many people say that they didn't feel like it was actually doing anything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really, against terrorism, I don't know -- I don't know.
L:  What I have noticed is that they have more machines now --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, the -- I guess the xray machines, and --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  -- are -- are supposed to be a little bit more high tech and be able to, um, pick out things that are, I guess, potentially hazards, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- smaller than -- than --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- than before [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, where -- where are you from, if I may ask?  You sound European.
R:  Yeah, I'm French.
L:  Oh, okay, okay --
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was in, um, France actually for New Years --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- this past New Years, yeah.
R:  Okay.
L:  Ah, went on a -- on a tour, and went to Paris and the French +Riveria -- it was -- it was actually quite nice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but, um, I flew into Barcelona --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- then -- and then it went from there and we left from -- from Paris, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I noticed, ah -- I had been to Paris other times before, and I noticed a little bit more, I guess, asking you [several inaudible words] -- when you leave Europe to come to the US, but not tremendously more -- the one thing --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I've noticed the -- the one that I see the most of all the airports, seems to be London --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- where -- if you fly out of London --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- it -- [MN] I don't know why it -- it gives me more of a sense that they -- tend to ask you more different places, I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- ah, they -- you know, they ask you when you begin the line, they ask more --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- questions when you get up to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, register for your flight --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they -- you know, they seem to search a little bit more, I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know, maybe they're worried about the IRA or something.
R:  [SIGH] Ah, may --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- maybe also -- also, I mean, they've been dealing with the situation for a while now [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, so I guess they --
R:  -- ways of trying to --
L:  -- they have a little bit more experience with terrorism.
R:  Yeah, may -- maybe so, maybe so, [SIGH] but ah, yeah, I noticed that, ah -- ah, I live in Nashville in Tennessee --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, ah, I went to the airport, ah -- ah, actually a couple of weeks ago, and they have actually brought in those humongous, ah, xray machines to scan all the luggage as soon as you actually check them in, you know?
L:  Yes, you have to actually hand it to them and they put in there before they --
R:  Ye- yeah.
L:  -- they put it on the plane, yeah.
R:  Yeah, yeah, and I mean those things are just humongous --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, ah -- ah, there was a, um, I -- I think that -- I can't remember, ah, where -- whether I heard it on MTR or read in a newspaper, but they were mentioning the cost -- the extra cost -- oh, it wasn't for airport security, it was, ah, whenever the, um, [LIPSMACK] you know, the ah, alarm -- the alert level --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know?  Was going from --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- green to orange, whatever --
L:  Yeah, mhm.
R:  -- how much money each city actually had to, you know, spend on extra security measures, and they were mentioning the figures for several places and it was -- it was quite amazing, but it wasn't actually completely related to airport security, [SIGH] but it -- they -- they seem to be making an effort --
L:  Just everything I can imagine --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- every landmark, or any place that could be a target --
R:  Yeah, which --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- you know, it's [SIGH] -- which is the problem, I guess, because that means that, well, yeah, yo- you're either gonna have to police everything -- you're gonna have to have an officer everywhere -- you're gonna have to have somebody always checking on everybody all the time, because it can just be anywhere, you know, even if you think of a -- a -- any kind of screening that they would have, um, [SIGH] ah, before you actually get -- you actually board, right?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You're allowed to have this carry on luggage, right?  And very o- -- I mean, they [inaudible] through xrays also, right?
L:  Yes.
R:  And, ask you to remove whatever could be a dangerous object, but, I mean, it's always the same -- I remember that one my bo- -- once my boyfriend, ah, had to actually give a pen he had in his bag with him --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I guess, he -- he had the really bad idea of kind of like, joking and saying that it was a weapon, which is really stupid in itself [LAUGH].
L:  It's kind of like, you don't do that there.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, you just don't do that -- you really don't do that, but, you know, I mean, it's like, well, yeah, I guess a weapon -- a -- a -- a -- a pen can be a weapon, anything can be a weapon provided --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you use it, you know, correctly -- anything can be harmful [MN] --
L:  Just about anything -- anything that you can insert into somebody, yeah --
R:  Ex- exactly.
L:  -- a pen, yeah.
R:  I mean, even like -- even the -- well, they don't give silverware anymore or --
L:  No, not even in first class.
R:  -- they give you plastic everywheres, right --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, even that, you know, it can -- it can hurt somebody -- it can really hurt somebody.
L:  [MN] It -- a -- [MN] ah, one of those plastic knives could be --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess, hard enough that you -- you -- you insert it in the right place --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- in somebody's neck, or something like that ...
R:  Yeah, esp- especially, ah, yeah, especially ...
