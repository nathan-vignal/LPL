R:  Hi, I'm Anna.
L:  I'm Frances ... and, we're supposed to talk about do athletes [inaudible] or deserve --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- high pay -- no, they don't [LAUGH].
R:  Um --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- let's see -- I think they get paid too much, already, and --
L:  I --
R:  -- ah, it's ridiculous that they're striking [LAUGH].
L:  Yes, it is -- yes, it is.  I totally agree with that, I don't think anybody should make that much money -- I [inaudible] [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, you go on strike because your conditions aren't liveable, or, you know, you're not getting paid enough to support your kids, or something like that.
L:  Yeah, not because you're making millions of dollars each year.
R:  Right, and you wanna make another couple of million.
L:  I mean, give me that money, I'll take it [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, seriously.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Like, I understand, you know, the janitors going on strike, or something like that.
L:  Yeah, fast food workers --
R:  You know, they don't get paid enough.
L:  -- or factory workers, or ... [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, but, um, people who are getting paid millions of dollars to do something that they enjoy already --
L:  Yeah, if I could make --
R:  I think --
L:  -- millions of dollars a year, I'd be perfectly happy.
R:  Yeah [MN] --
L:  I wouldn't argue about any of it [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah ... um, have you ever followed up with the strikes at all?
L:  N- --
R:  I'm not really a big sports fan.
L:  No, ah, I really haven't -- I didn't realize anybody was on strike [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, me neither [LAUGH].
L:  Ah, my husband watches the baseball, and, that's about it -- football, but --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- ah, I'm not really into sports.
R:  Yeah, no, me neither [LAUGH].
L:  I listen to him complain about 'em every now and then, but --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- I don't pay a lot of attention, but I do know we talked about it before, you know, you make millions of dollars a year, and you're the one on strike, that's just crazy.
R:  Yeah, and also, it's not fair to your fans, because --
L:  No, it's not.
R:  -- they haven't done anything, you know?
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  You're depriving them of [several inaudible words] pay 'em.
L:  You know, they're pay- -- they're paying their millions of dollars a year as it is [LAUGH].
R:  Right, right.
L:  But.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  See, I don't know -- we're just -- we're just in a little state of Kentucky, so we're not really --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in with all the major league stuff, you know?
R:  Yeah [LAUGH], yeah.
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  Um, yeah, so definitely not a fan of strikes --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- although my school, ah, they [MN], um, starting striking -- the people who are employed to like, you know, work in the dining halls and stuff like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I totally supported their strike, because, you know, they had reasonable claims --
L:  Yeah, I agree with that --
R:  -- like ...
L:  -- I mean, you know --
R:  Yeah, but I mean --
L:  There's -- there's people out here working minimum wage jobs, that --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- you know, I mean, they're actually working, I mean, it's not enjoyment.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right, they're not playing a game.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Oh, crazy.
L:  I wish somebody would pay me to have fun [LAUGH].
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Please, I'll throw a ball around for a million dollars, you know [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Fall down a coupla times, and I may even let it hit me occasionally, for --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- [inaudible] million dollars a year, you know?
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah ... [MN] do you play any sports?  Have you ever --
L:  No, no, not since high school, I was [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- some track and stuff like that, but, no, not since then -- I'm too old for that now.
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  How 'bout you?  Do you?
R:  Um, I used to play soccer and I used to run at high school, but not anymore [LAUGH], at all [LAUGH].
L:  No, I [inaudible] got too old for that, I do well to chase the grandkids around now, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's like ... you know --
R:  Um ...  
L:  I do -- I do nice simple stuff -- I clip coupons and play [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  You know?  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Nice, simple stuff.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, so, and you're in Kentucky?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah --
L:  It's a wonderful --
R:  I'm in Cleveland, for the summer, but I'm from New York.
L:  Oh, you're from New York originally?
R:  Yeah, so, it's been quite a change.
L:  Oh, yeah, I bet, I bet.
R:  Very different. [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  Ah, we went to see the Indians game, which is, I don't know -- I guess that goes along with the theme [LAUGH] of sports [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] It was kinda boring.  [LAUGH] Yeah, if they went to a -- if they -- if the Cleveland Indians went on a strike, [LAUGH] I don't think anybody would notice.
L:  Oh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- well, my husband watches Cincinnati Reds so he probably would notice --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] -- well, he may know, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'm just like -- I'm not -- I -- if it's on, I'll -- and I'm sitting there, I'll look at it every now and then, but it's -- it's not something I'm really interested in.
R:  Yeah, I'm exactly the same way.
L:  Well, you know, I told him, I've got better things to do than watch a bunch of grown men chase --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] a ball.
R:  [LAUGH] Run around, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  And you -- you know, I'm sitting here thinking, "Who's getting ten million dollars a year for that?", you know [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.  It's crazy, I mean, you know, people study their whole lives and, you know, become award winning scientists and they don't get paid a million dollars.
L:  Yeah, exactly [inaudible] --
R:  So, where do these guys get off, demanding more money?
L:  [MN]
R:  They're not providing a crucial service to mankind, you know what I mean?
L:  No, I don't think anybody [inaudible] --
R:  They're not -- you know, they're not --
L:  [several inaudible words] money --
R:  [MN] It's crazy.
L:  I mean, the President doesn't make that kind of money -- not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] in any way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, it's just grade --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that it comes down to.
L:  Yep, 'cause you get people dying every day, in Iraq and stuff, and they're getting a few hundred dollars a month.
R:  Yeah.
L:  For to go over there and be shot at [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Blown up, or whatever, I mean, and their families are on food [inaudible], and --
R:  Yeah, their kids are starving.
L:  -- they're trying to survive, yeah.
R:  Yeah, and [LAUGH] you know, they're not going on strike --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and if they did, they'd only get, like, a five dollar raise, these people are --
L:  Yeah, if they were lucky.
R:  -- you know?  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] You know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's just -- I guess that's just part of life.  [NOISE] 
R:  Yes ... it is.
L:  [NOISE] Well, my [several inaudible words] about, ah, professional athletes going on strike, so, I think you should chase them round the house and they should give you a few million dollars a year [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband said my son told him to give him a minute, and he could chase him around the house.
R:  Oh [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I could definitely use a million dollars for throwing some balls around [LAUGH].
L:  Oh [MN], yeah, you know, I'd do it for a lot less, you know, give me fifty thousand a year, and I'll go out there and do it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I'll take it, no problem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you live in this State, if you get thirty thousand a year, you're doing good, so ...
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  Fifty would be terrific.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Thirty wouldn't be bad [LAUGH], but ...
R:  Yeah, for a little light exercise.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I need -- I need motivation to exercise anyway, that would be [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, that would --
R:  -- that would be good motivation.
L:  Yeah, it would, I mean, get rid of a few extra pounds, and ...
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] And get a following, you know?
R:  And earn some money in the process [LAUGH].
L:  That would be all right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I hadn't thought about it that way, but that'd be a good way to do it.  
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe we should call 'em up and tell 'em we'll play baseball.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, we'll -- we'll be your professional athletes.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  People would have a lot more fun watching us.
R:  Oh, yeah?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  [PAUSE] Um ...
L:  Do you do a lot of these surveys?
R:  Oh, no, this is actually the first one I've done.
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause this is my second -- I had a guy the other night, it was on family values, and stuff, and [MN], like I said, this is only my second one, and it didn't go well at all, because he didn't have a family -- he was single.
R:  Oh, god.
L:  So, it -- you know, it was like, almost impossible to talk to him, because he didn't know anything about raising kids, or anything, you know?
R:  Oh, man, I wonder [MN] --
L:  Because he didn't have any, and I thought, boy that was a lousy match up, you know? 
R:  [LAUGH] Wow, do they -- like, why do they do these studies?
L:  Ah --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- it's my understanding that it's through the University of Pennsylvania.
R:  Yeah, but what are -- I mean, what are they studying?
L:  They're just studying different world opinions, and the way people in different parts of the country think, and stuff.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, I seen it -- actually I seen the thing on a -- on a website, on a refund website, and I thought, "Well god, you know, ten minutes to talk on the phone -- I can do that".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  [inaudible] 
R:  And you get -- you get ten dollars, right?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  For each phone call?  
L:  You know, so I thought, you know --
R:  Did you get your check?
L:  I haven't yet, but you know, this is --
R:  Yeah, see I'm -- I'm kind of [LAUGH] ...
L:  I just did the one --
R:  -- skeptical.
L:  -- the other night, but I was telling my husband about it, and he --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- said, "Well, it'll be okay as long as they pay you", you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I was reading on this rebate site -- this refund site, and you know, those people say they're getting their checks, you know?
R:  Okay, good.
L:  Now, that's what they're saying, you know, and usually everything those ladies say on there is true --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I was like, well, if they're getting their money, then I'll do it, you know.
R:  Yeah, that's easy money, I mean -- ten minutes, ten dollars.
L:  I told my husband, I said, "You know --"
R:  Incredible.
L:  "-- if I thought I could get enough calls ...", I said, "That's all I'd do".  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, seriously [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Nice little part time job.
L:  Yeah, I said, you know, get paid to talk on the phone -- that would work. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Oh ... um, yeah, [inaudible] good deal [LAUGH].
L:  But, you know, I don't know how many calls you can get, because at the time that I signed up for it, I was working full time, and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, I just put down, like, between eight and nine, or something --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- so, I, you know, I'm thinking I might change it and see if I can get more calls, you know, like during the day ...
