L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, [MN] Anthony.
L:  Oh, oh, this is Emerald, how are you doing?
R:  I'm doing okay.
L:  Ah, yeah, we're supposed to talk about the Middle East, so, --
R:  Yeah, the topic is about --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] issues in the Middle East.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] Should the American troops still stay there, you know?
L:  Yeah, --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think the Americans, uh, America should still participate in the, uh, peace talks, [MN] --
R:  Y- yeah, the peace talks but, they're, like, you know, most of these -- since the war's over, we lost more troops than in the war, 'cause, like, every day on the news, you're hearing some troops getting killed, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- so it's, like, you know, then, you're sending home some, and then, you're sending more over there.
L:  Right.
R:  It's, like, [MN] the ones over there, like, they're never going to leave.
L:  That's true, it does seem like it, because, we're in [MN] well, Iraq, and that other country, with bin Laden, I forgot the name of that country, we got troops everywhere, s- spread too thin.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's, like, they're, like, the troops don't know when they're coming home, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and that's not all, but I think we should -- I think we should send the troops and them home, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because what they're doing, we help with the Iraqi police over there, that'll take --  it's, like, when they done -- have them set up what- whatever th- they have them set up, they should, you know, let the American soldiers come home, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, let them take care of their business, you know, but, they don't do what they w- -- said they were going to do [inaudible] already, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, [inaudible] Saddam, they did that already, so, --
L:  Right, and they -- well, I think they were asking, I don't know, if they were meaning, when they talk about the peace talks, that they mean with Palestinians and the Jewish people, too.
R:  Yeah, but that's the next -- that's the next one, too, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, you know, we -- we didn't send no troops down there.  You know, you just leave --
L:  Right.
R:  -- them alone, so them fight them by themselves, you know.
L:  And more people are getting killed, uh, soldiers are getting killed every day, over there, seems --
R:  Yeah, --
L:  -- like.
R:  -- a lot of soldiers getting killed, so it seems like war isn't actually over yet.
L:  Right.  That's true.
R:  Yeah, but they still -- they still a lot of issues with Iraq, [MN] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where they're trying to form a new government, they got tax, then they got to see how they can bring the economy up, Iraq back up, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, and then they got to fix back up the place with all the bombing that they did, --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- you know, this place has got to be fixed, so --
L:  And that costs a lot of money.
R:  -- costs a lot of money, and I mean, US going to be, US government going to be, you know, spending some money over there, you know, so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, but --
L:  And there's -- and there's things need to be done here, instead of --
R:  Yeah, things, yeah, so -- but, I mean, that is what Bush doing, you know, he's spending the money over there to help fix back up Iraq.
L:  Right. [MN]
R:  -- you know, I think, why didn't they just take the money that Saddam's Hussein had and fix it back up?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Take all the money he had in the bank.
L:  -- yes, um, I don't think the -- ah, do you think there'll ever be peace over there, that's one of the questions, do you think they'll ever settle down to be peaceful?
R:  Ah, no, I don't think so, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I don't think so, 'cause there's still a lot of people that angry at the Americans --
L:  Oh, yeah, --
R:  -- killing them, --
L:  -- that's true.
R:  -- you know, a lot of people are still angry about that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- a lot of people over there don't mind how Saddam Hussein was, a lot of people over there did love him, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, some didn't, some did.  So, those that still killing Americans, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- those are people who are, like, were loyal to him, --
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, so I don't think we ever going to see peace over there, even if a new government comes, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, there ain't going to be peace, but there's still some rebel groups out there.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there's still going to be --
R:  -- so, forming a few government is good but still there ain't going to be no peace.
L:  Yeah, I don't think.
R:  -- there ain't going to be no peace, in the Mi- -- especially in the Middle East.
L:  Yeah, I don't think so, either, they're -- they have so much generations of hatred, and teaching their young children, too, --
R:  Yeah. [MN]
L:  -- that I don't think it's going to be peace, not for quite a long time, maybe --
R:  Yeah, not for --
L:  -- thirty years.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, not for a long time, so, even with the Palestine's and the Jews, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they say they're sitting down to talk, they can talk as long as they want, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but there ain't going to be peace over there, because the Jews -- the Palestine's and the Jews [inaudible], the Jews say, "No", they're --
L:  Right.
R:  -- [inaudible], you know, --
L:  -- well, it was the Palestinian plan in the first place, anyway, you know.
R:  Well, then the Jewish take over, you know, and, they built a wall there, you know, and they're certainly got [inaudible] no peace, then in Iraq, there ain't going to be no peace, --
L:  Right.
L:  -- so, I don't see no peace coming in no time soon.  Like, what do you say, maybe in thirty years.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible] I don't see no [inaudible] peace agreement, it ain't going work.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And another thing, that's fine if you can change your mind, and, you know, they can change their mind any time.
L:  That's true.  And then, there's things like, there's so many different factions, you know, one part of the Palestinians might say yeah, they want peace, and the others say no, and we're going to do everything to prevent it, --
R:  Yeah, so.
L:  -- and they can't control all of them.
R:  No, they can't control all of them, so, it's, like, [MN] there's going to be more -- more killing in -- in Israel, especially with those suicide bombers.
L:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah [MN] --
R:  There's going to be more of those stuff going on, once, there's no peace, there's going to be more of those. So --
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  And they -- that's hard to fight against, a --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- suicide bomber.
R:  You know, and then, you think about it, when the suicide bombers attack, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the Is- -- the Israel attack them back, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so, that's definitely, again -- retaliate more again, --
L:  Mhm. [MN]
R:  -- you know, so, that's why the war keeps going on and on, because as soon as a suicide bomber do something, they attack the Palestine's back for that.
L:  Right.
R:  So, when they -- they attack the Palestine's, they say, "Okay, we attack back" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, it's just a back and forth, back and forth, --
L:  Back and forth, right.
R:  -- stuff.  So --
L:  -- and it doesn't stop, 'cause you keep hearing on the news more suicide bombers, or, they did this to the Palestinians, it just doesn't stop, doesn't --
R:    Yeah, it ain't going really stop no time, they ain't going to really stop no time soon, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, hopefully all those soldiers come home, because, you know, there's an awful lot of soldiers over there after the war done, -- you know, it's, like --
L:  Yeah, this is supposed to -- to be over, is- isn't it, now, the war?
R:  Yeah, it's over, but those soldiers are still in Iraq.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Those are the ones who are dying, now.
L:  Yeah, uh, --
R:  They're getting ambushed like crazy.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, and they don't know where it comes from, but they're getting ambushed.
L:  -- right, and they don't know who is -- the -- the other people aren't in uniform, so they don't know --
R:  Yeah, they don't know.
L:  -- who is who.
R:  You know, [inaudible] they're getting ambushed day and night, you know, so, it's, like, I don't know, but hopefully, they come home soon, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, they come home soon instead of --
L:  Hopefully, well, --
R:  -- yeah, hopefully home soon.  So --
L:  -- some people say this -- they want the oil, and, ah, that's why the Americans are still there, but I don't know.
R:  I don't think they want -- I don't think they want the oil, because, I know there's oil over there, but, you know, they can get the oil from -- from -- from their neighbors --
L:  Mhm.  We- --
R:  -- you know, not Iraq alone, they can get it from some other places.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  So, they can go to Saudi Arabia and get some oil, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can go to Iran, and get some oil, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, all those different places, you know, but I think you just have them over there as peacekeepers, you know, until everything gets straightened out over there, in the Middle East, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but it's good to have them over there, but you know, -- you know, we're losing life too, at the same time.
L:  That's not good, there's people still getting killed, yeah, I don't like that.
R:  Yeah.  At the same time we're losing life, why are we trying to bring order to the scene, you know, that, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and to the country, that's exactly what they're doing, they're trying to bring order to the city, they're trying to arrest all the looters who loot, you know, --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but you know, we should leave that to the Iraqi police to do. [inaudible]
L:  Yeah, maybe they're afraid Saddam Hussein will s- -- come back, or something, I don't know, they can't find him, or don't know if he's alive or dead.
R:  Ah, but I got a feeling, I got a feeling he's alive somewhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah -- somewhere, I just have a feeling he's alive somewhere, he's just -- they ain't going to find him.
L:  No, but I think that, --
R:  But --
L:  -- that America still needs to stay in the peace talks, though, they're trying to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- keep it together, so there may be something that'll stop some of the killing, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, they ain't going to find him, so -- 'cause he could easily cross the -- he could easily cross the border and go into one of those next --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, Muslim countries.
L:  Oh, yeah, change his -- disguise himself, yeah, yeah.
R:  Yeah, one of the Muslim countries might, you know, might hide him over there.  So -- [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  Yeah, they can hide him over there, you know.
L:  So many places he could be hidden, yeah.
R:  Yeah, but no, but the Americans don't need to go looking for him, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't need to go places looking for him, just, you know, just do what you have to do over there, in the Middle East, and then just come back home, that's it.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, you're winning, you did what you had to do, go finish up, do what you have to do, and --
L:  Just come home, come out of there, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  But that
