R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  [MN] Did you hear a tone?
R:  I didn't hear anything, that's why I was just wondering.
L:  [LAUGH] Hi, my name is Randy, I'm calling from New York.
R:  Hi Randy, I'm Dante, and I'm calling from California.
L:  California, wow, we're on opposite ends of the coast.
R:  Yeah, we are.
L:  We are -- so, what do you think?
R:  Where am I staying?
L:  What do you think?
R:  Oh, what do I think, about --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- athletes and strikes?
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, it's -- it's kind of a catch twenty two, I mean, I figure any job that you get paid for, you know, doing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, that are unionized --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, I -- I -- I kind of as- assume that it is their right to go ahead and strike --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, after all, they are working.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, granted, we as non professional athletes, or myself, I don't know about what you do -- um, we kinda see it as unfair because we see it as, that's our recreation, that is, you know, the -- the stuff that we do that's aside from work, our work.
L:  Right.
R:  So, when we look and them, and say, "You know what?  I think it's stupid that these guys get paid millions of dollars to do what they do --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- whether it be running, or jumping, or kicking, or shooting, or what- whatever" --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, I can see where a lot of people raise their eyebrows at it, and just say it's stupid, but, um, also at the same token, for -- for it being their means of -- of living --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I think it is kinda fair.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Aside from [MN] the dollar amounts that I guess they're making.
L:  Right.  [SIGH] 
R:  But then, when you -- and when you look at it the other hand, the stuff that they do -- how many people in the world can actually do it?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that's why I kind of -- I see it as fair, but it's a catch twenty two, because, you know, I also agree with most people saying, like, you know, if you played basketball, you know, all you're doing is playing basketball, but, anyway, what do you think?
L:  [SIGH] Well, you know, it's all relative, I mean, you're right, how many people can --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- really do what they do --
R:  Right.
L:  -- at that level, and so, they make so much money but it's -- it's relative --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, I think that, yeah, they're -- they're making, you know, x number of dollars, but they also should have the right to strike, um, so, you know, it's -- it's like, you know, fair competition they should be able to strike for -- for, ah, things were in -- in their contract --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, if you or I were able to compete --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and to play, um, professionally --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we should be able to -- to -- to strike as well [SIGH], ah --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, I -- yeah, I don't -- it -- some of these questions are very interesting, ah --
R:  I know.
L:  -- I don't need -- I don't know where they come from --
R:  I know.
L:  -- I really don't -- it's [inaudible] -- I mean, just t- t- to think of these questions, [MN] I sit here thinking, "Wow, where do these questions come from?", [SIGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, like --
R:  But, I'm -- I'm sure these are -- these are also the, um, [SIGH] oh, I -- I guess I wanna call them, like, census takers because I'm sure these are the things that we see as little pop ups, you know, in our -- you know, over reading it -- it -- news on the internet and what not, that this survey says this, and that survey says that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so I'm -- I'm sure what -- we contribute to that as well.
L:  [SIGH] I guess, you know, in the overall scheme of things, these -- these are the things that people, um, [MN] that keep you busy, 'cause you can't sit and think about the real, serious issues that -- that, ah, that we face in our daily lives --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, because we w- -- we would all go pretty crazy if -- if --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- we did, esp- -- well, you know, you've got different issues in California than we have in New York --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, we all pretty much have the same issues, but, we have different issues day to day --
R:  Right.
L:  -- different reminders of things, and, um, we can't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- you know, [inaudible] your problem is, and the last reminder is --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- professional sports --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's always the last thing that's on the news --
R:  Usually.
L:  -- it's not the weather -- it's -- it isn't even the weather, it's the --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's sports.
R:  It's the sports, and the feel good story of the night.
L:  That's right, that's right, and, um, you know, it's -- it's hard to be very sympathetic --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, when someone's making, like, so much money --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on the other hand, you know, I really do feel that it's relative --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, like, I mean, it's kinda of getting off the subject a little bit, you know, when somebody's charged with, you know, whatever --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then they're suspended, or, [SIGH] um, it's hard to have a lot of empathy for them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- on the other hand, you know, they're living at a certain -- they have a certain standard of living based on what they're making --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I mean, I'm not gonna have what they're gonna have, because they have this, you know, this, like, nine figure salary --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and, you know, so I -- I -- I mean I really do they sh- -- they -- feel that they should be able to go out and strike, well, granted I may not agree with what they're striking for --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but that's, well, that's not the subject.
R:  Well, but the [MN] -- it part -- I think it partly is, because I mean, if you think about it, and I don't know how much a fan of basketball you are --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, but I enjoy basketball a lot, and I'm a short, little --
L:  Oh yeah, okay.
R:  -- I'm a short Mexican -- I'm five nine --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, I have to shoot three pointers because I can't even get close to the net, so --
L:  Oh [inaudible] [LAUGH].
R:  -- but, um --
L:  [inaudible] five feet.
R:  Oh, okay, well --
L:  So, you're five nine -- you're really tall to me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You're like, perfect height --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, to me, you're the perfect height, you know?  So ...
R:  Right, but, um, you know, I --I -- I think about it, and I -- I think about what one person can bring to a franchise, and you gotta think of -- they play basketball --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- each team is a franchise -- it's not a -- it's not a -- a team, per se -- it is how one person makes their living -- the owner of that team --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- therefore, if you can nab a certain someone, who can bring, you know, prosperity to a team in the form of championships and what not, along with him comes a form of -- a form of popularity --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and, almost, um, [NOISE] what do you call it?  Um, role model ship --
L:  Right.
R:  -- to a community --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- hey, you know what?  All of a sudden jerseys get sold, all of a sudden seats get sold --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- all -- so, when one person, or various people, can bring that to a team, and then they start putting, ah, the league, let's say, starts putting restrictions on them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- okay, if -- yeah, I mean, the numbers are outrageous, but at the same token, if those numbers weren't there until a certain someone, or a certain individual got there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then, it's kind of saying, like, "Hey, you know what?  I'm bringing you millions of dollars --"
L:  Mhm.
R:  "-- and now you're telling me that I can't get paid x amount of this, or x amount of that" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it's kind of, [MN] like you say, it's relative, I mean, the US Post Office loses one percent of its mail a day.
L:  Right.
R:  Now, one percent is nothing --
L:  [inaudible] today.
R:  -- but, how much mail do they get a year?  
L:  [inaudible]
R:  Or a day?
L:  Now, if it's your mail, you think it's a lot [inaudible] --
R:  Millions and millions and millions of -- of -- of letters.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know, and I'm assuming, you know, millions and millions is still in the millions of that one percent --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- so, you know, if -- if that, like you said, if it's your mail -- if your check is the mail --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or if your bill, or whatever --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- is in the mail, and that's gonna screw you up --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm.
R:  -- when you use the Post Office daily --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, then you can say, like, you know, "I have a right to gripe".
L:  But that, and they'll tell you to your face, that "Well, you know, x percent -- we -- we deliver x percent of the mail" --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- but it -- to you, you know, even as an intelligent, informed person, it still doesn't matter -- it's like, when somebody says, "Well, noone else ..." -- this just happened to me the other day, with my cellphone --
R:  Right.
L:  -- "Nobody else complains about that" -- I don't really care.  You know, I don't care what -- and I don't believe that, but that's not true --
R:  Right, exactly.
L:  -- I care that I lost my service.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I mean, I -- I fully understand the point that you're making, and it's -- you know, it's like in any kind of sales -- you're bringing x number of dollars, um --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- in, and if you're that -- if -- if you are of a certain value, and in -- in something like sports it's -- I mean, yes, it's -- it's quantitative, you can, ah, you can quantify what you -- what -- to a certain extent --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- [SIGH] and then there's the part that you can't quantify, you know, in terms of goodwill and -- 
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all the other things of course, and, you know, and -- and, in our society, you know, you -- you -- you -- you're not even looking at that, but then there's a -- there's a -- the thing you said about a role model, and, there's a big part of that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [MN] you know, with inner cities, and especially, um, us -- us both being from -- from big States --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- there's so much of that, that we can't even see that part, but we know that exists, especially with certain, with basketball players and certain --
R:  Right.
L:  -- baseball players -- not all of them, you know, they're not -- there's not good in -- there's not good in all of them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, and I -- I would say that the mercenary aspect is the m- -- is -- is the greater part --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [SIGH] however, that's -- that doesn't even matter, so, ah [MN], you know, but -- but the thing about a right to strike, you know, I -- I always wish I kind of had a unionized, you know, kind of job -- not because of --
R:  Right.
L:  -- striking, but for a lot of -- a lot of other reasons.
R:  Right.
L:  [SIGH] So, I think this is one of the first topics you've probably covered in school, you know, right to strike, and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and all of that, and, ah -- you know, it's --
R:  [MN] Okay, now see, now, here's the other thing -- here's the other thing, I mean, like -- you said the word school --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I'm thinking, okay, the people that matter most, that are gonna teach our, you know, our kids --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to actually get up and possibly become a pro athlete, or a doctor, or a lawyer, or a janitor -- who knows what --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're paid very little.
L:  Right.
R:  Across the nation anyway --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, if they have the right to strike, I mean, they are providing a service to the public or the taxpayers, much like a professional ath- ...
