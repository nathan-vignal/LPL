L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  My name is Jo.
R:  My name is Laura.
L:  Hi.  I guess we have to talk about airport security?
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I guess, yes, I agree that the increase in airport security, um, will [NOISE] make it safer. [NOISE]
R:  I think so too.  I'm not sure if they'll find any other kind of ways to get around, [LAUGH] you know, airport security.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  You know what?  I have to agree with you too. [NOISE] 'Cause if they're motivated enough, then they will find a way. [NOISE] But --
R:  Right.  And I know that in different cities there's, like, a -- like, in New York and Miami and those types of cities there's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, a bigger or a -- a more of a -- a security whereas in other cities there's, like, less [LAUGH] security.  So --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  I guess because -- I don't know.  They don't think that it's -- I don't know where -- where I'm from, I think our security is still pretty high at the airport.  But -- I don't know.  I haven't traveled lately.  So, I don't know what it's [LAUGH] like. [LAUGH]
R:  Me neither. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Not really.  But I think that they would be able to find any other means.  I mean, if they really wanted to do something, I guess, they -- they c- -- still could go through other means, like, m- -- on the bus or the train or whatever. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess, maybe, they, um -- it wouldn't affect as many people but they still could hurt people.
R:  Right.  But I don't think it has, um -- I traveled, um, not too long ago and it didn't seem to, um -- um, take as long as they were assuming it was gonna take through all the checkpoints and everything.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, that's good.  But during times when it's really busy, I'm not sure if they would let, you know, like, people fl- -- through[?] or not, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Without necessarily doing all the checks that they could.
L:  Actually, when we traveled last -- it was last year -- I think we had to go through, like, two or three checkpoints [NOISE] and then they stopped -- I think they stopped my husband and they made him take off his shoes and everything.
R:  Right.  They say that they do, like, random people.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  And make 'em do, like, extra things because a- -- I remember last year, me and my niece -- I was bringing her from Texas to Oregon, where I live, and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, she -- they made her, you know, go aside or whatever and checked her backpack and made her [LAUGH] do all these other kinds of things.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  When I was talking to one of the guys here he said that they mark your ticket when you check in so that they know who to do that to or whatever.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  I w- -- thought, "Okay".
R:  And then sometimes based on your name or your origin too.
L:  Yeah.  That's true. [NOISE] True. [PAUSE] Ah, how many minutes has it been? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.  So, I'm not sure.  But I'm not sure if they lower the amount of security that they do, depending on what, um, the terrorist level is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, like the colors --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that they put on the terrorist alert or whatever?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I -- well, I live in Hawaii --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and our state, I guess, is, I think, yellow.  Even when the country's in orange, I don't know, for some reason our governor keeps it yellow.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But the airport's the federal -- the federal facilities, they -- they go to whatever it -- whatever the country is.
R:  Right.  I guess they -- what they do is what the airport is depending on how much of a risk they think --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that airport would be at because, like, our airport here is an international airport --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they have quite a bit of security just because, um, people from international cities are coming in and flying in and out of, you know, international ports.
L:  Right. [PAUSE] So, I guess --
R:  So, I guess they have more, I don't know, a security level. [LAUGH]
L:  I guess I'm -- I am, kinda, glad that they're taking these security measures.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  But then there was --
R:  But it's funny because, like, ah, I traveled and I had one of those combs that has the long -- it was a plastic comb with the pick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, the long one stick.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they said that that I could use that as a weapon so they confiscated [LAUGH] it.
L:  [LAUGH] Did they give it back to you when --
R:  M- --
L:  -- you're done flying or ...?
R:  No. [LAUGH]
L:  They just take it?
R:  They told me that I could not take it on the plane because it could be considered as a weapon.
L:  Wow.
R:  Even though it was a -- plastic.
L:  Wow. [PAUSE] I know --
R:  So, anything sharp b- -- even -- even, like, ah, plastic forks and knives are not allowed.
L:  I know.  And they wouldn't allow my sister to, um, bring her tweezers on the plane.  They didn't --
R:  They wouldn't allow her to what?
L:  Bring her tweezers.
R:  Oh.  That's weird.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I'd -- that is metal but I thought, "What are you gonna do with them?"
R:  I know. [LAUGH] I wonder what they do, like, when they, um -- because some of the -- some bags are randomly scanned --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- what they would do, like, if -- if a randomly scanned bag had something like that in it? [PAUSE] Not necessarily something that you were gonna bring on the plane yourself.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  But something that was gonna go in the cargo.
L:  The cargo area?
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know.  I -- I wonder if they should put it in there?  I'm not sure.
R:  But I know that --
L:  'Cause well, h- --
R:  -- they don't allow --
L:  -- here, any time you go to the, um -- to the mainland from here --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they s- -- they scan all your bags anyway.
R:  Oh, okay.  Hm.
L:  Yeah.  They have to scan all your bags and then if they mark you then you have to go through another special scanner.
R:  Right.
L:  Or whatever.  Or they open --
R:  I know that -- I'm originally from, um, the Dominican Republic --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and when you go there, like, when you land there, even after all the scans that you've gotten through the airports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they, like, hand look through your bags and make sure that it doesn't have --
L:  Oh, my --
R:  -- anything like that in it too --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- that you're bringing into the country. [NOISE] [PAUSE] Which is pretty interesting too. [NOISE] [PAUSE]
L:  Where is the Dominican Republic?
R:  I'm sorry, I could barely hear you?
L:  I'm sorry.  Where is the Dominican Republic?
R:  Oh, it's in the, um -- it's right on the equator next to Puerto Rico.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's not, um -- are you a territory or --
R:  No.
L:  It's its own country?
R:  Right.
L:  Well, that's cool. [PAUSE] I- --
R:  So, they -- they do their little search but --
L:  Security.
R:  -- it's interesting because when you go out, they don't do the same kind of search as they do when you go in. [LAUGH] They just -- they do scan everything, they put it under, like, a conveyor belt to where it'll scan everything so they'll be able to see everything in there -- in your bag.
L:  Mhm.  But they don't --
R:  But they actually have gentlemen who hand look in your bags and stuff and make sure that there's no drugs or no --
L:  Crap.
R:  -- weapons or anything like that. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  I wonder why they're not as concerned about when we go out? [LAUGH]
R:  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  I know. [LAUGH]
R:  I'm, like, "Okay".
L:  Hello?  What about the country you're going to? [LAUGH]
R:  Right. [LAUGH] I guess they're just mostly concerned about themselves.  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE] But -- yeah.
R:  They're, like, "Well, they're leaving and they're leaving with some bad stuff then ..."  They'd figure that we would check it because you do -- like, I usually land in Miami in --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in their airport they run, you know, through all those scans and stuff too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When -- especially when you come from, like, an international --
L:  A- -- yeah.
R:  -- site.  You have to go to the area where they check all your bags and everything.  And they ask you if you're bringing anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- vegetation, drugs, whatever.
L:  Whatever. [PAUSE] I know that, um, [LIPSMACK] well -- what was I gonna say? -- [PAUSE] Well, the security, like, won't help any with SARS though. [PAUSE] You know, that, um --
R:  With, ah, SARS?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yeah.  So, I'm -- I w- -- I d- --
R:  I'm not sure how that'll help.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  I wonder if they would be able to -- they'd be able to figure out a way to -- I don't know.  I guess you're limited with the -- with the flow of air or whatever in a plane.
R:  Right.
L:  So, there's not much that they can really do.
R:  And the thing that they're doing now is th- they're just trying to tell people that they can't, um -- they can't come to the United States that are from those areas. [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Which is horrible for someone who just, you know, went to visit. [PAUSE]
L:  V- -- oh, right.  Right.  So, then they're stuck.
R:  Right. [PAUSE] So -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah.  W- --
R:  But, um, I guess they're trying to, ah -- also, it w- -- it would be hard --
