R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is Vaneet, I'm calling from Houston, Texas?
R:  Hi, I'm Dina, I'm calling from Memphis, Tennessee.
L:  Oh, okay, nice place.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] so, how are you doing?
R:  Um, I'm just chilling today.
L:  Okay.  So, what's the -- the issue is, like, issues in the Middle East, right?
R:  Right.
L:  So, what are your opinions about that?
R:  Um, I think that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the United States possibly has been a little too aggressive in some areas and not aggressive enough in other areas.
L:  Okay.  Uh, actually, what I believe, like, US should continue its involvement in the Middle East peace process, because, I think, there's a -- definitely a need for a third party intervention in the peace process, and without it, there will be no peace in the Middle East, and -- and, actually, it's not a threat only to the Middle East, it's a threat to the other countries also, like, basically, the threat to the countries in that region as well as to US also.
R:  Yeah, but there's so many problems around the world globally that there's no way that the United States can be responsible to try to fix every single problem, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I mean, with me having, you know, um, studies in the Christianity religion, I mean, I, I just -- I don't know, I think that -- that it's something that can't be handled by man, I think that it's going to take a prayer, --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and a higher being to -- to be able to have everyone in peace, 'cause I just don't think the United States is going to be able to accomplish that.
L:  Oh, [MN] -- what's your religion, again, you said?  Christianity?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay, [MN] I am, like, Hi- Hindu religion, but, uh, basically, the threat is, it's not, like, a question of religion, say, M- -- uh, Muslim or something, [MN] Islam religion, but basically, it's, ah, like, what I was reading the other day, uh, there's, uh, some- -- there's something mentioned in their holy book Koran, that says, like, Jews and, uh, Christianity are enemies of Islam, so, possibly, this is the reason that they done a lot of attacks on Jews as well as on Christians, possibly, and since the US policy is a biased policy towards Israel in the Middle East, so, that's the reason the threats are coming continuously to US as well as to Israel, and I believe, like, definitely, the US -- US can do a lot more in Israel, ah, the Middle East peace plan.  R:  [COUGH] I mean, I just, I don't think that the United States is capable to solve --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all the problems.
L:  Oh, yeah.  What, what ca- -- what is the reason or wh- what are the cases or what are the reasons that you think US is not capable, or [MN] --
R:  Well, I mean, the American culture is so much different from other cultures, um, --
L:  Oh, yes, yes.  Truly.
R:  -- you know, and, you know, it's, like, say, for example, you know, um, you're in a club somewhere, and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and you get in a fight, well, the bouncer can come and break up the fight and throw you out of the club, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but that doesn't mean that they're going to be able to make you become friends.
L:  Pardon?
R:  It -- like, you know, when you get thrown out of the club or whatever, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and the bouncer has stopped you all from fighting, but that doesn't mean that he's going to be able to, you know, um, get you all to be friends, to become friends, to be civil to one another, I mean, it's just not going to happen, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because -- 'cause, you know, our -- the American government, you know, is a financial giant, and it is, you know, um, a power country, but I don't think that Americans have the -- I -- it's, like, we -- we haven't been through a lot of things that a lot of other countries have been through, for a very long time, as far as, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- having people trying to take our property, or, you know, um, infringe on our rights, and stuff like that, --
L:  Mhm, mhm, mhm.
R:  -- so, we're not capable of even understanding that, first off, because we -- we don't have to go through that, --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and we haven't for a very long time, and you have so many different religions and you have so many different views, and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- you know, --
L:  Look, okay, [MN] let's see, like, uh, see, since nep- -- September eleven, why did, first of all, the question is, why did September eleven happen?  Okay, the question, it's because US had a biased policy in Israel, and then, it was more inclined towards Israel, right?  Right.  And this gave a, like, a wrong impression to the terrorists over there, and that's the reason the September eleven took place.  Now, these terrorist threats are regularly coming from countries like Lebanon, Syria, and there have -- they have a lot of terrorist infrastructure over there, Iran, so, unless, like, US has some, and being a superpower, US has a responsibility in the world, like, [MN] it has to take care of the other matters are happening around the globe, otherwise they're going to give continuously the threat to the, uh, United States.
R:  Well, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I see that a lot of money is being spent trying to fix a whole bunch of people's problems in various places in the country, but you know, a lot of the problems that are in America are being ignored.
L:  Ah, yeah, y- -- not truly, like, because, see, one of the important areas of the US government policy is the foreign policy, they have a big foreign policy department, or, State Affairs Department, and they have their internal [MN] internal affairs department also.  But it's not like that, yeah, true, US -- you are right, since the involvement of US in other affairs, like, Mid- -- say, Middle East, like, Iran, I- -- or say, Iraq, and, say, Afghanistan, the internal problems have risen, like, you have lot of unemployment, right now, you have lot of, uh, -- the economy is not growing, the stock market is down, like, truly, it is -- you are right, like, the internal problems are affected, but, if you say -- if you look twenty years ahead from now, fifty years ahead from now, to make world a better place to live, or, say, our children, our kids, they don't perceive a threat or a terrorist threat and they don't want to see another September eleven, I believe there should be some US involvement.
R:  Well, I mean, the countries that are, you know, not at peace with each other have been in that state since AD, I mean, --
L:  Yeah, they are in -- see, this is well cons- -- it dates back, like, it is, like, being there for fifty years or more than that, even.
R:  It's been a lot more than fifty years, I mean, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you go back and read in history books, it's been throughout history, and --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- I just, you know, I don't think that you can take an environment such as the Middle East, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the United States is going to be able to fix any of the problems, it's just going to cost the American people a lot of money, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- because you're not going to be able to change their views because you've got a superpower country over there, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all that's going to do is create retaliation against Americans, and Americans are going to be struggling, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because, I mean, -- do you live in America?
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  -- I mean, I am a white female, and I know that it's very difficult to get a job, because minorities get placed first on the hiring scale, --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, I mean, it's really creating a problem here, to spend so much money in other places, and they, --
L:  Oh, yeah, exactly, see, I'm also --
R:  -- they're not going to be able to solve a problem that's been there as long as, you know, the human race has been on the face of the earth.
L:  Yeah, actually, I'm also facing a problem, see, I'm out of a job for almost two years, and I'm hunting for a job for two years, so, it's not, it's a question, like, what, see, I'm looking, see, I'm want- -- I want to make the world a better place, in my opinion, that's what I feel like, but anyway, every -- every person has its own opinions and everyone has its own views, so, we should respect the views also of others, but, uh, -- so, what else do you feel about this?
R:  I mean, I feel compassion, you know, for the innocent people over there, but I, --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you know, and I wish there would -- there could be, like, this miracle, um, to come about, and it'd be a peaceful place for them, and they can enjoy the kind of life --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- that Americans have been able to enjoy, you know, within their own culture, --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and -- but I -- I mean, I really, really don't think that the United States is going to be able to go over there and change something that has been a problem throughout history, ever since mankind has been on the face of the earth.
L:  Oh, yeah, you are right, but, [MN] it's not, in, as you, [MN] ah, the question is not the correct involvement of US, like, in, -- like, in Iraq, you had a direct involvement with the military.
