L:  Hello?
R:  Hi [MN].
L:  Hi, my name's Alannah.
R:  Alannah, my name is Kelly.
L:  Nice to meet you, Kelly.
R:  You too.
L:  Where are you from?  Texas?
R:  No, Louisiana.
L:  Oh, that's pretty close.
R:  Yeah, where y'all -- in Texas?
L:  New York --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- ah, New Jersey -- New Jersey actually.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Yeah -- yeah --
R:  [MN] So --
L:  -- I don't why I said New York.  [SIGH] So, yeah, airport security.
R:  I'm just not real sure, I mean, I haven't flown --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in so long.
L:  Really?
R:  Well, I've tried to make a habit not to.  [LAUGH]
L:  [MN] Oh, are you -- are you scared to fly?
R:  Yeah, I am now, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I'll be honest, I -- I -- I am.  I've always been a little nervous, you know, when I was flying --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but, now, I'm just downright scared to do it.
L:  Oh.
R:  No, my parents do it and my sister does it all the time -- doesn't bother --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- them at all.
L:  Yeah, I -- I travel pretty often too, and [SIGH] I -- I don't feel scared in the terrorist kind of sense, I -- it is scary being on a plane, being --
R:  It really is.
L:  -- that high in the air, if -- if something goes wrong, but, I try to just put it out of my mind, and [MN] you know, I gotta travel, and I love to travel, so ...
R:  Yeah, well, my neighbor just flew to Germany and she was on a plane for twelve hours --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and just get [MN] -- once you're -- once you're there it's -- it's okay, to me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, once I'm there, but, you know, she's going through the process of trying to become an American citizen and it -- she was just really terrified, because, you know, she didn't know -- with all the new security, and everything, how it was gonna work, with her --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- trying to get in and out of the country.
L:  Mhm, oh, it --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- you -- you -- you never know, when you -- when you go there, if they're gonna make a big deal out of a little thing --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or, ignore a big thing, it's -- it's strange -- I think they do, um, a lot of profiling, um --
R:  I think so, too.
L:  -- which, I don't know if it's -- it's right or wrong --
R:  Right.
L:  Ah ...
R:  And, does it work?  Well, we don't know.
L:  [MN] I --
R:  Or, I don't -- I don't --
L:  I think it probably does, even though I don't like to say it -- I think --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I know -- I know it works, well, I don't know that it works, but I have a friend who actually works for Homeland Security --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, ah, she went to the airport -- one of her assignments was to go to the airport, and, um, watch the security guys, um, look for drugs --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and -- and so, they had these people come in that were hiding drugs in all sort of -- sorts of body cavities, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, she asked, you know, "How do you catch these guys?", and they said, "We profile".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they catch a lot of them, so --
R:  [MN] That's amazing --
L:  I mean ...
R:  -- the technology they have.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, it's also, to me, amazing the technology the criminals have, too.
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  Yeah, as a matter of fact, I just got through watching -- I don't know if you've ever watched it -- on Saturdays they have a show called Behind Closed Doors, with Joan London --
L:  No, I haven't seen that.
R:  -- and she profiled -- ah, she did a show one time about the airport and everything and the -- well, actually it was the mail and how they catch, you know, illegal drugs and stuff going through the mail --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and bombs and st- -- oh, it's just amazing.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  So, yeah, I guess, the weirdest thing my neighbor had to deal with, was she had to take off her shoes and she thought that was very strange.
L:  Yeah, pretty much everyone has to take off their shoes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's because, um, in sneakers there's metal strips --
R:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] --
L:  -- in the soles, I mean, in almost all shoes, and so they want you to take 'em off, so, they can --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- see, like [MN] -- the thing is automatically going to go off from the metal in your shoes, so, they have to check.  Yeah, and now people know, um, you know, wear -- wear shoes that are easy to take off and make sure your socks are good when you go on a plane --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause you're gonna have to take off your shoes.  [SIGH] 
R:  My --
L:  -- I know they --
R:  Huh?
L:  -- they stop -- they stopped, like, an old lady for -- for having knitting needles, and the people that they stop and -- and -- and search thoroughly sometimes, it's just surprising, just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "Oh, let that poor woman through."  [LAUGH] 
R:  Did she get to take her knitting needles?
L:  [SIGH] No, knitting needles are not allowed.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Did -- how do you get it back?  Can you --
L:  I don't know how it works.
R:  -- get your stuff back, or ...?
L:  I -- I guess, I'm -- I'm really not sure how it works.  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, my parents -- my -- my parents live in Texas and they fly to Arizona quite a bit -- that's where my sister lives --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and my dad, he is such a cowboy -- cowboy boots, cowboy hat, the gold belt buckle --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he almost had to strip --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- down, I mean, they make him take everything off.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, you know, his boots [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know, [MN] he is so far away from what a -- I guess a terrorist would look like -- he looks like a old cowboy. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And, I guess that's why they're trying, you know, do to that, I guess.
L:  Yeah, and they -- they're pretty good now, about watching when you go through the metal detectors --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it used to be, I think, a little more lax, and now they're -- they're pretty diligent --
R:  Right.
L:  -- about it.
R:  And, back to my neighbor -- when they flew to Germany -- her husband just had his knee replaced, so, it's all metal [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and he kept setting off the things --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- the metal detectors so they had to body scan him.
L:  Yeah, oh, did -- did he have to go into one of those full size --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- yeah, yeah.
R:  I told her, I said, you know, "They can see, I mean, everything".
L:  Yeah.
R:  She did -- she didn't realize, 'cause they're kinda older --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they didn't [LAUGH] -- they didn't really know, but, she didn't care.  I guess what kind of [MN] blew my mind a little bit -- they had to fly from here to Toronto to Germany, and you know, it was during when all the SARS and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and she was so sick --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- she had a bad summer cold, and -- 
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it just hit her, and I thought, "Oh, man" -- she was so afraid that --
L:  That they'd stop her in Toronto?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  But, they didn't -- they let her fly.
L:  Oh, good.  [SIGH] 
R:  And even told 'em -- she said, "You know, I've got a cold", you know, 'cause she's very honest --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I thought, "Oh" --
L:  Yeah, and then [LAUGH] I -- I -- in May, also at the same time when SARS was really bad, I went with a friend to Japan.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Where SARS didn't hit at all really, but, it was still kinda -- people asked us, "You're really going there?  Be careful -- are you going to wear masks?" --
R:  Yeah, did you wear a mask?
L:  -- and it -- no, we didn't.  There were people in the airport that did, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- mostly in Japan nobody -- it wasn't too prevalent.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, my friend also got a cold while we were over there -- he got sick --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and he was worried because -- he was worried that he might get SARS because his immune system --
R:  Was down.
L:  -- is -- was down, and then he didn't wanna -- I mean ho- -- he had to hold back coughing at the airport and the whole thing -- he really didn't want to get in trouble with that, [SIGH] but, neither of us got sick, which is good.
R:  And that's when you wanna cough, is when you're not supposed to.
L:  Right, exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  But, that's -- it is kinda, you know, traveling has gotten kind of, you know, a little bit different I guess, you -- you don't take things for granted --
L:  Right, it's true.
R:  You know?
L:  [MN]
R:  We live in a real small town, so, anytime --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you hear of something, it's like, "Ew, we're in a small town, this won't happen here", you know -- you --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you have that mindset, but now -- we live out by the military base, and I attend college on the base --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so, that's a little bit -- you know, you think about things a little bit differently [MN], you know -- it's hard to get on base, it's hard to get off base --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know.
L:  [SIGH] Um, what's -- what's interesting now, um, in the New York area is, back a few months ago, there was a plane -- or, two planes that requested permission from the FCC to fly low over Manhattan -- I think they had just come back from Iraq --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they wanted to do, like, a flyover over Manhattan, and the FCC okayed it, and, um, but, people in New York, I mean -- you're downtown [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and they see these planes flying low, and they freaked out, and, so, Mayor Bloomberg, calls up the F -- FCC, and, like, gave them hell for -- for allowing that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- well -- well, this weekend I was listening to the radio, and apparently they let it happen again, but, this time they warned us, like, you heard on the radio -- on NPR -- "In a half an hour, there are going to be planes flying low -- they will be starting from this point, and be going over to Hudson, and there will be three F fifteen fighter jets ...", and they just warned everybody in advance, "This is going to happen", which is -- it's interesting.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Why -- why did want to fly low?
L:  I don't know -- I really don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  Are they tr- -- I mean, are they trying to see something, or ...?
L:  [SIGH] I guess, I -- I know nothing about these things, I just heard it on the radio.
R:  Yeah, airline tourists.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Gone to see all the buildings and stuff.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I guess, mm.
R:  We had some friends go to New York, and I thought that was kinda interesting, 'cause that's some- somewhere I would like to go.
L:  Oh, it's a lovely city.
R:  I bet it is, I mean --
L:  I --
R:  -- a lot to do.
L:  Oh, it's wonderful, it's my favorite.
R:  I mean, the -- I tell you, where we shop here, the only place we have to shop -- to buy groceries, and just anything, is Walmart, and that is it.
L:  Mm.  [MN] 
R:  When you have out of town -- the closest place -- a big city, is Huston.
L:  Right, I lived in Huston for a little while, so, there is good variety there, but, that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's a -- that's a ride for you, if you're gonna go to Huston --
R:  Yeah, three hours.
L:  -- just to go shopping.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  Oh, so, you're right on the Texas border, then?
R:  Right, we're right by Fort Hope[?].
L:  Okay.
R:  So ... and, you know, there's just nothing here, just Walmart, and I like to go to Dallas -- I have friends in Dallas that we go visit quite a bit --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that's so much fun, because, they have everything there.
L:  Yeah, New York is very different from those cities, um, ah -- [MN] it's different from Huston in that, in New York everybody walks everywhere --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and there's a subway system that everybody uses, so, everyone -- public transportation is used, as opposed to Huston, where everyone's just, in their car all the time.
R:  Right, I bet it's a lot nicer, too.
L:  Um, no.
R:  [several inaudible words] It's not -- it's not?
L:  [SIGH] The -- the city's kinda dirty ac- ...
