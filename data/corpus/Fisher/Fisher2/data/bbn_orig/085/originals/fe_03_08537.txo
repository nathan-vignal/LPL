L:  Hi, my name is Corinne.
R:  Hi, Corinne.  My name is Ron.
L:  Hi, Ron, okay.  Uh, you heard the topic of the day, correct?
R:  Yeah, airport security. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  Um, I -- I guess I'll start first.  Um, I --
R:  Okay. [NOISE]
L:  Okay.  I think that, uh, it's useless that they're +spending billions and billions of dollars on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- all this security and --
R:  I say arm the pilots and have air marshalls.  That's about all the security you really can --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- need. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- you know, you can't check every -- they're not checking the baggage well enough --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if they would have had --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- air marshalls and armed pilots on those three planes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it would have been a non issue.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, our country's -- you know, doesn't -- we're too timid.  We --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN] [NOISE] What else would you like to ask me, now?
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, okay, uh, I'll continue.  Um, I actually took a couple of flights in the past two months and how -- I mean -- I mean, you know, they're stopping these little old ladies, making 'em taken off their shoes.  I mean, if [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah, well, you need racial profiling if you're going to do it, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] just -- just -- they're not blonde haired Scandinavians and they're not, uh -- they're not, uh, you know -- they are what they are, I mean, unfortunately --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Hispanics and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- black skinned, uh, African Americans --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and other minorities are going to get searched but, hey, look at --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Look at who's blowing up planes, um --
L:  Yeah, exactly. [NOISE]
R:  And -- and, you -- now you have to check women because, uh, women, even white women, uh, have been known to, uh, uh, associate with these characters and are easily, uh -- easily +influence -- influenced by their, uh -- by these men.
L:  I mean -- I mean, what's -- you know, I totally understand but, you know, they were like ninety years old.  I mean, come on, she could barely walk --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- and they were going to have to take off her shoes.
R:  -- it's -- yeah, it's not ninety year old ladies that we have to worry about, it's not fifty year old men, it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's Arab men and women, mostly in their -- in their late teens --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to, uh, late thirties.  I mean --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's -- it's -- why waste everybody else's time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But we're too goddamn politically incorr- -- politically correct and it's going to get people killed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's going to cost American business too -- thousands if not millions of dollars.  Um, you gotta stop playing around and get serious with it, close up the borders, uh --
L:  Exact -- yeah, that's the thing to close the borders.
R:  -- bring our armies home to protect America --
L:  And not --
R:  -- not protect France, not to protect Germany --
L:  -- protect other --
R:  -- England --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but to protect us here.
L:  Mhm, I --
R:  Not to protect Japan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Fuck Japan, screw 'em all and let's protect our own.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I totally --
R:  And we talk about rebuilding I- --
L:  [NOISE] Iraq --
R:  Iraq.
L:  -- which I think --
R:  Well, what about rebuilding --
L:  What about America?
R:  -- our cities?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, what our people?  Providing Iraqis with --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  With medical care, what about people in our country without medical care?
L:  Exactly. [NOISE]
R:  Uh, we're -- we're -- we're stupid for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  We have -- we ha- -- we -- our best and brightest do not work for the government.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Our best and brightest are afraid to go work in politics, they're afraid to have all the skeletons in the closets brought out but the fact is we need our best and brightest in the government --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we're not getting that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and -- and is this the survey, ma'am? [LAUGH] I thought I was taking a survey.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, um, no, this is --
R:  I don't --
L:  [LAUGH] Okay, I'll tell you 'cause I've actually done it before.  We're --
R:  'Cause I -- I don't know what this is, I --
L:  Oh, well, um, I don't work for --
R:  I -- I know my wife told me that we'd be getting a call for a survey and that's fine and stuff --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- but I don't know if you want to hear my -- [LAUGH] me spew[?] because I could go on and talk all day with this and waste --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Waste all your time.
L:  No, well, I actually don't work for the company, I'm just like you.
R:  Oh.
L:  What happens is the company calls or they contact you and then they call and then if you agree --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they contact somebody else, which was me --
R:  [NOISE] Okay.
L:  -- and they give you the topic of the day and we're just two strangers who they listen to talk about the topic.
R:  Oh, they listen to us talk?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, well, hey --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I could talk on that subject all frigging day.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- I didn't know if anybody was really interested in how I felt about it.
L:  [LAUGH] Apparently people are.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, well, I -- I'm su- -- you know, I am --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very liberal on -- on a lot of things but not when it comes to crime --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I believe in -- I'd rather be on the offensive than the defensive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have no problem with -- with -- with this I -- Iraqi war --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I think we should go into Iran --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think we should go into any other place, in Saudi Arabia --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we ought to turn 'em to glass.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm sorry, you -- you -- let's get the oil and then -- or -- or turn 'em glass because those hijackers were not Iraqis, those hijackers were Saudi Arabians --
L:  Arabians, yeah.
R:  -- and -- and screw them, screw the King of Saudi Arabia and all his fucking princes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I believe the CIA is filled with -- with -- with good -- with good people and we ought to just let them go and kill these bastards --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- before they kill more Americans --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and take 'em all out one at a time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Let our -- let our people, our military's the best, let them go and let them do their job and let's stop being politically correct and let's get down to the dirty work of killing these people.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] What else? [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Um, I think we're supposed to talk about, um, only airport security during the conversation. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, airport security?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We wouldn't need airport security if we would let our military --
L:  Military.
R:  -- do it's job.
L:  Exactly.
R:  And why is our military --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, our military should be in our airports, our military should be in our ports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- military should be on our borders.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Any port of entry.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's -- we need our best and brightest and our military is great --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but we -- we -- we got 'em protecting everywhere else but here.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  They should be in our airports, they should be on our planes.
L:  Yeah, I mean, I --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, you know, if we're going to pay -- if we're going to spend money [inaudible] should be the military --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in the, uh -- you know, instead of the security guards who get paid, what, eight dollars an hour, you know what I mean?
R:  Well --
L:  Ten dollars.
R:  -- we should have armed personnel --
L:  I mean --
R:  -- an abundance of armed personnel in -- in airports and on planes.
L:  And exactly.  I mean, these security guards --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- are not armed.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what are they going to do --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, if something happens.
R:  "Stop, I'll mace you".
L:  Yeah, I mean, real -- I don't think they even carry mace, do they?
R:  Uh, probably not.
L:  You know.
R:  "Stop" or, "Stop, halt".
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, this isn't Britain.
L:  Mhm. [LAUGH]
R:  Even British cops [LAUGH] are starting to carry more -- you see more and more of 'em carrying guns.
L:  [NOISE] Exactly.
R:  The fact is we gotta stop being so goddamn politically correct --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- and racial profile is -- is the key.  Uh, good security practices, watching who you hire.  See, the problem is you can do all that airport security upfront but if you're not protecting your rear and -- and just letting everybody get in and, uh, to the back and not screening these people, only once in their lifetime ... those people that work in the back should be screened every three months.  Maintenance workers --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everything --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- because people -- people infiltrate.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They got -- they have cells in this country and all they are is you're checked out once and then -- and then that's it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's not right. [NOISE] Those people -- those people back there -- and why -- why are immigrants hired for those jobs, why aren't those jobs --
L:  Exac- --
R:  -- going to Americans.
L:  Americans.  Yeah, I mean, I notice a lot of immigrants --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- doing airport security.
R:  Yeah, I've been out of work, too, in my life and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I can't get a job at a frigging airport.
L:  Of course.
R:  Yet they hire some wetbacks from out -- out -- out of this country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I -- I, uh, have a real problem with a lot -- I gotta lot of issues with airport security.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Airport security is nothing but a frigging joke.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, all you need is you gotta do what the Israelis do, you check everybody coming in and everybody coming out --
L:  Coming out.
R:  -- with a metal detector and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And if you think that they fit the profile of somebody's who going to blow up your plane --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well then goddamn it check 'em --
L:  Check.
R:  -- and -- and arrest 'em --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and send 'em out of this country and anybody who doesn't have the right papers to be here shouldn't be here and -- and that's all there is to it and stop playing around with people's lives and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Before we have another, uh, nine one one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And the -- you -- you [LAUGH] know what else is a joke?  The security code reds and, uh --
L:  Oh yeah, I mean, what's -- I mean, I think that just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- uh, sc- -- scares people. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, the fact is we always are on a code red --
L:  Right, yeah.
R:  -- and the fact -- and the fact is we have to learn from the Brits who have dealt with the Irish problem, they're always on alert --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and with -- with our Israeli allies [NOISE] and we have to learn [NOISE] -- we have to learn from -- from the Israelis 'cause the Israelis [NOISE] don't play around with these bastards. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] The Is- -- we need to do -- we -- we need to let -- let -- we need to be like the Israelis and -- and follow what they've done and put our pride aside and just learn from what they've gone through. [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  [NOISE] And -- and -- and the fact is, on an Israeli plane I think the pilots are armed and it wouldn't surprise me if Israeli secret service or some other secretive organisation has -- has at least two or three agents on every plane.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They wouldn't dare [LAUGH] mess with an Israeli plane 'cause they know they're going to get their asses shot off.
L:  Mhm.  But now -- but -- but don't --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Don't pilots now carry --
