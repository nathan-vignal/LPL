R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, this is, uh, Dick.
R:  Uh, hi, my name is Deidra.
L:  Deidra?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Nice meet -- nice talking to you, Deidra.
R:  Nice talking to you.
L:  What do you think of the topic?
R:  Um, as far as airport security goes, um, I think they should have had it, uh, before this thing happened.  Um, that's why they was able to get in the way they were.  Um, I, uh, also think that it's not foolproof anyway, as far as airport security goes.  Um, I mean, I've been through the -- what is that, LAX?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, and it's also inconvenient because I don't think they, um -- I think they select certain people to check than others.  I've been to some airports where they've been selective about who they check.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And it -- you have to get there, like, a couple hours before you have to leave --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so it's a little inconvenient but I'd rather have that than a bomb hit us or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, what's your opinion?
L:  [SIGH] Well, they -- they -- they -- I think they say they're going to cut back on security than now.  They're going to have fewer --
R:  You think they should cut back on security?
L:  They're going to have fewer screeners or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, uh, they're going to have more than they had before so --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- it's -- it's a deterrent for terrorists and people that want to hijack a plane or anything like that.
R:  Right.
L:  And anything that can deter it is a good thing.
R:  Well, I didn't hear that last part.
L:  Anything that can deter the threat of a plane being taken over or bombed or anything is a good thing.  I guess they're trying to measure how much security they should have to create the most deterrent with the least upset to the passengers and the cost.
R:  Right, I agree with that.  I've been checked fairly, I've been to airports where I've been checked, the soles of my shoes, um, and it's a little inconvenient, that's why I don't travel as much as I used to.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I think, uh -- I don't think people should wait till things happen before United States +decide -- decide to do anything about it.  Um, I hear people bitching and complaining and I understand about the -- the lines and the waiting and all that but I just think, um, better safe than sorry.
L:  Right.
R:  Have you had any instances at airports that happened --
L:  I haven't been on a plane in twenty years, I don't think.
R:  Really?  You don't travel?
L:  Not by plane.
R:  Okay.  So I don't think, um -- I mean, I've had -- I know a lot of people that have traveled and had worse, um, things happen to them before this incident happened --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- just by singling certain people out to check their bags and make 'em feel like criminals, um --
L:  I guess if you're going to travel any distance at all it's best to go by plane --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, uh, I don't travel great distances or across country or to other countries, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And when I go outside the city, we -- I just drive.
R:  What -- what's that?
L:  We drive.
R:  Oh, drive, anywhere you want to go [LAUGH] you drive?
L:  Well, we don't travel more than fifty or sixty miles out of the city.
R:  Mhm.  I don't know, airport security is, um -- I live in Pittsburgh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Pennsylvania --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and [LIPSMACK] here it's really not -- I don't think the security is as strict as in some of the other major cities like, maybe, New York, Los Angeles and places.  I can just tell the difference in how I'm treated compared to other airports.  Um, but I believe that, um, it's still not as good -- I don't think there's nothing going to be hundred percent foolproof of anything --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as far as traveling and, um, anything else you do.
L:  As far as that nine eleven terrorist thing, um, weren't some of them actually pilots on the plane?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And some of them hijacked to become pilots but some of them were already pilots weren't they?
R:  That -- yes, yes.  But do you think it's a good idea if, as far as the security goes, some of the pilots -- I mean, the, uh -- they carry guns in the -- what is that, the cockpit?
L:  Cockpit.
R:  I don't even know what that's called.
L:  Cockpit.
R:  Do you think that would be a good idea as far as security goes?
L:  I -- I don't know.  I -- I like the idea of having it sealed off by a -- a rod -- a bar or something they can't break in.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I like that idea.
R:  I think they should -- I don't -- I don't have a problem with having a weapon if they're trained to do it [NOISE] along with their --
L:  What if they miss and it puts a hole in the plane?
R:  Well, that's true [LAUGH]. If they miss [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, if they're trained properly, like anything else --
L:  What if there's a struggle and the thing goes off and --
R:  Well, that's true but I just think to be equal as far as, um, the pilots and it -- uh, security.  If they -- if the -- if the terrorists get past security --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then they get on the plane --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, and then you don't have anything to fight with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, I just think it -- you should level the fi- -- playing field as far as that goes, uh, but they should also have some training along with that.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they're not policemen, they're pilots.
R:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
L:  They're not policemen, they're a pilot.
R:  I understand that but I think in today's -- today's -- the way times are, um, things are going to change.  I think that, um, um -- I think it warrants them getting training for that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- as far as protecting, um, the passengers and protecting the plane.  Um, I mean, it's not going to get better.
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, I think things are going to happen, I think things are in planning now as far as what's going to happen next --
L:  Right.
R:  -- regarding that and I think people are just taking it too lightly about it 'cause everybody think, well, um -- but I don't think they should just have security at airports.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think they should have security at other, uh, major government --
L:  [several inaudible words] secure everything in this country.
R:  Right but you notice in some countries -- I notice the United States they're the most lax when it comes to security.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it's --
L:  Course now there is a -- the -- the threat to other countries.  You know, other countries sponsor terrorism --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they come over here and blow up a gas station or --
R:  But we just preach --
L:  -- aliens.
R:  -- and claim to be such a superpower --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I don't think we're that much of a -- I just think we're just a bunch of bullies when it comes to that stuff but when it comes to protecting our own people, um, I don't think we do it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as well as we should.
L:  Probably don't.
R:  I mean, I --
L:  There's always a threat that we could go over there and start blowing their stuff up, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And we have the CIA and the FBI and --
R:  Right, that's what I don't understand.
L:  -- military to do that.
R:  That's what I don't understand.
L:  In fact, that's all we did after they bombed, anyway, went over --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and took over Afghanistan and Iraq and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- used some muscle. 
R:  But I don't --
L:  So we -- we have that threat, too.
R:  Yes, we do.  I mean, I'm -- I'm sure we have threats, um, as far as --
L:  Why they didn't blow up some buildings in, uh, Saudi Arabia, I don't know.  They were behind it.
R:  Right.
L:  Everybody knows that, nobody says anything.
R:  Nobody wants to admit anything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- as far as that goes.
L:  Right.
R:  So I don't -- I don't know if, um -- I don't know if that's going to make a difference as far as, um --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- beefing up the security because there's people already here, as far as I know, and there's people already maybe, um -- I think we're looking for a certain, like, uh, kind of people thinking that they're the kind of people that's going to blow up but it could be somebod- -- somebody that looked like something -- like everybody else.  Everybody's looking for, um, people who look Arab and -- and have been --
