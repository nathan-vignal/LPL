R:  Guy.
L:  Hi I'm Monica.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Okay.
R:  We'll do like lady's first so let me here what you got to say.
L:  Um, well I don't think actually peace ever will be obtained here and I really never thought we should be there in the first place.  That's my opinion.
R:  Well I have to agree --
L:  I don't agree with it.
R:  -- well I -- obviously I have to agree with you because, um, personally -- okay what's with this there's never going to be peace in that land no matter what happens even if they give the Palestinian's their own state or whatever is it's never going to be peace you know.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, as far as I see it we have much much bigger issues abroad that we have to deal with instead of worrying about what's going on with other countries.
L:  Right.
R:  The US is always run into country civil wars, it's called a civil war --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- between two countries nobody is supposed to be jumping into it to get involved.
L:  Right.
R:  Um, but there will never be any type of peace what so ever because, um, number one you have terrorist groups --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they're always going to be against -- they are always going to be basically against anything that has American interest in it.
L:  Right.
R:  And you seen that everyday we hear about these you know suicide bombers of different embassies --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and how they are connected to the Unites States so you are going to have that always and, um, as long a those terrorists groups are around that's going be, um, that's going to be a serious situation because you never know when they are going to strike.
L:  Right and I mean just like for instance the September eleven thing I mean nobody here expected -- they're not the normal average day -- every day person didn't expect that to happen but you know who knows what Government knew about all of that and but I just don't think that you know a long with you know they have a lot of other religion -- religious issues there that we could never settle in a million years with what's going on over there and I just don't think that the US should be involved in -- you know we go over there get involved in another countries issue, tear up the country then we have to pay to put it back together again it's just [inaudible]
R:  Oh, cause -- you bought up a good point about the religions because, um, one of the main things that people really worried about is you know especially if you US gets involved are they going to try and convert a lot of these nations that are already Muslim nations into Christian nations and lot of people don't want to hear that.
L:  Right.
R:  They don't want to hear that because basically those people who die for their religion so for you to come over and say oh we want you to you know convert to Christianity then, uh, that's going to make things probably even worse.
L:  Right.
R:  So here we have this situation of yeah major problems over there is the land but now you can have somebody else that doesn't belong over there say, "Oh well you're going to change over to Christianity", you know, they don't want to hear that.
L:  Yeah and it's not going to happen either.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  But not without a fight, I mean things -- I don't know in my opinion it just seems that things seem to be getting worse and not better I mean even though we're -- troops are there and they're taking over they're still -- it seems like there's more killing now of troops now than when they were actually in supposed to be in combat.
R:  Yeah it does because the war was like basically when you think about the really in time combat it was no more than a month.
L:  Right.
R:  And now you're hear about more soldiers killed with these guerilla attacks people thinking Saddam is dead, he's not dead he's still one, um, he's supposed to be still alive somewhere.
L:  Right they don't have any proof that he's dead I mean nobody you know.
R:  No DNA as far as you are concerned if you have no proof you is to say hey this guy is dead well now tell these people that he is alive.
L:  Right.
R:  You know let's not -- let's just say we don't know if he's alive, we don't know if he is dead but hey that's all Government they're not going to tell the truth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All that they care about is our tax dollars and when it comes to Israel that's American occupied territory anyway.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If you think about it because we give them over three hundred billion dollars a year.
L:  Right.
R:  So for even [inaudible] if you hate the US but for you to see a country that basically you are giving money to they're more of a target.
L:  Right definitely -- definitely -- well also you know like I have a big problem too the fact that the main reason we went over there was supposedly because of these weapons of mass destruction --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they have not been able to show any sign of any proof that -- that -- that even existed.
R:  Well --
L:  You know --
R:  Right.   Sorry continue.
L:  No I was just saying [inaudible] if that was really the case if they knew that they was there then they should not be taking this long to find them if they knew that it was there, so I just don't believe that they had that knowledge --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they just used that as a ploy to get over there and get support to go there and we really shouldn't even be for there.
R:  Well there are two issues that I think about when we went over to Iraq the first issue was the oil you know if you think about it in Iran that company was based on oil they lost millions of dollars you know people killed themselves because of the amount of money they ended up losing.
L:  Right.
R:  So that was one reason they had to go over there because they had to get that money back one way or the other.
L:  Right.
R:  Second of all it comes to nuclear weapons of mass destruction Iraq doesn't have them we hear everyday North Korea has it.
L:  Right and we're not doing anything.
R:  Well it's like this we do anything if those missiles were flying over here.
L:  Right that doesn't -- they know that too.
R:  They know it you know and that's the hesitant you know why we should target that and try to work with something with these people like listen drop the weapons we know see what we can to even though they were vacant -- broken and believe like three or four, um, trees but still you know that's the bigger problem we know they have it so why always cut why when we don't know really that they have it and let's try and deal with cutting nations out that we know definitely have it.
L:  Yeah I just feel really like you know we shouldn't be over there because we're always in somebody else's, um, war and -- and it's also politics and money it's not really for the better of those countries I mean a lot of times if you look at -- now we're fighting Iraq with, um, you know the Iraq's but before it was Iran I mean you know when is it going to end you know when are you going to stop changing sides.
R:  Right and if you think about it also the majority of the weapons that Iraq does have we sold it to them with [inaudible]
L:  Right.
R:  That whole [inaudible] we sold those Iraqi's the weapons to help them fight the Iranians.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So now isn't it a little funny now that you know fifteen years later here they are using the weapon that we gave them against us.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah that's really -- that's unbelievable right there I mean that just shows how our Government just contradicts itself -- yeah, "We're going to give you weapons" and then you know one thing leads to another, "Oh, we are going to turn on you, let's see now we have -- you have something that we want, we want to take it now".
L:  Right, you know and I don't know I just -- I don't think it's going to ever end but I really don't think we should, um, we should be involved I think a lot of lives have been lost for the um -- been lost for the wrong reasons you know you know I could see if they really went over there to protect our country but I just don't see it is that I don't see -- I don't see any of that stopping terrorism.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just -- I don't see that happening.
R:  But what really -- what really gets me though is, um, United States they always talk about, um, weapons of mass destruction we have also.
L:  Right we do too so why do we get to have them and nobody else does I mean it's just crazy.
R:  I mean it just makes you wonder when -- when they are going to use them again.
L:  Right.
R:  It makes you really wonder but, um, but if the United States -- this is how I look at it the United States continues to be involved in the Middle East situation is never going to be peace.  The US just has to basically step outside of it and if anything try to become a mediator instead of an instigator.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because that's why I really think it really boils down to the -- they need some type of nation to come in that can be a fair type of mediator that could probably straighten some of these things out some of these issues out.
L:  Right.
R:  Because right now the United States is not helping.
L:  Right and I they're -- they're in there for their own personal interest.
R:  Right and when --
L:  Or [inaudible]
R:  Right.
L:  Sorry.
R:  That's no problem.  But one of the issues are like we had you know is protecting Israel because of all of the investments that they do have over there you know sorry to say but that's how it is.
L:  Yeah, and I mean I understand that -- that -- then you need to think about why do we have all of that there I mean it's again the political and a money thing.
R:  Oh, yeah definitely and when you look at the ice age really perfectly this idiot we have as a President he's not running the country his father still is.
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible] because I'm sorry but Bush does not, um, he -- well let's look at him he doesn't really have the intellect that could run a nation or run a war without having a lot of advise from somebody outside of, um, outside of like you know his cabinet or what not so the only person he probably runs to is his dad -- "Daddy, daddy, daddy, how do to this, I'm an idiot".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [inaudible]
L:   From what you can see it's not like he's showed a lot of that anyway.
R:  Right he sure has he sure has.
L:  In public there has never been -- [inaudible] behind the scenes thing you know a lot of people I've talked to they feel that way you know like what is he doing?
R:  yeah.
L:  Like this whole thing with, um, the you know with that letter with that statement that was made --
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know saying that they made a false statement about weapons of mass destruction and about the, um, about them going over to Africa purchase -- what was it, um, something to build weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I was like
