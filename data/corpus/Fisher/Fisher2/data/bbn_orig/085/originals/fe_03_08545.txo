R:  Hi, this is Robert.
L:  Hi, it's Melanie.
R:  Hi, Melanie.  How are you?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Good.  Have you had this topic before?
L:  Uh, airport security?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No.  Have you?
R:  [LAUGH] Yes, I did.
L:  Are you serious?  That's hilarious.
R:  Yeah, it's funny 'cause actually, um, I talked to, um, quite an older gentleman who had a lot of very strong opinions about this so when I heard airport security [LAUGH] I was thinking, "Oh no, I'm going to get --"
L:  [LAUGH] Oh no, not again.
R:  "I'm going to get -- I'm going to get somebody else who's, you know, ex, uh, FBI, CIA, who's going  to ..." [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.
R:  'Cause, um, I just decided to be difficult and say that I didn't think airport security was doing anything --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- so he proceeded to tell me all the thousands of reasons [LAUGH] why it is working really well.
L:  Oh gosh, that's in- -- horrible.
R:  Have you traveled, uh, by air recently?
L:  Well, actually, that -- it's really funny that I got this topic, um -- the -- a couple months ago, you know, when they were first implementing the new TSA project --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I worked for, uh, VS Imagewear and they were the people that outfitted the entire TSA, um --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- and I actually traveled to all these different airports and outfitted all those security people.
R:  Oh, so I have got another expert. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, uh, in this -- only in the sense that I know firsthand what idiots they can be.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH] I, I don't know, it's, uh -- it's -- it's -- it's, you know -- it's a mixed bag of, uh -- of emotions, you know, I --
R:  Well, you -- so you'd probably have some more accurate insights into what has changed.
L:  Well [LAUGH] I'll tell you right now those definitely were not the brightest people I've ever met in my whole entire life --
R:  Right, right.
L:  -- but, um, you know, they're -- I mean, it's -- it's in- -- it's interesting, I guess, that -- it's good that they are trying to maybe improve -- like I'm sure the quality of people have -- has not changed that drastically --
R:  Right.
L:  -- based on salary and everything like that and the fact that they have to hire in such mass amounts.  You know, I'm sure it was the same before but I guess at least we can look forward to better policies and procedures maybe.
R:  Right.  Do you --
L:  I know, I mean --
R:  Do you think they're actually catching anybody because, you know, we hear about the amount of knives and guns that are being -- but no -- there -- there is never an announcement saying, "We caught a whole bunch of terrorists about to board a plane", right?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I actually -- the funny thing is is that I do know that they've caught, maybe not so much as a lot of terrorists but a lot of people.  Like a lot of my friends have gone -- have flown, um, and, I mean, had just ridiculous things taken away from them, you know, like pairs of tweezers, like my one friend she had a Swiss army knife that, like, had her name on it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and it was on her keys and they took it away from her.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it was like a gift from her mom and all this stuff and, um, you know, one of my friends, he totally should not have had this, but he had a knife with him and, you know, it was -- it wasn't a big thing, it was just, like, one of those collapsible ones or something and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- he, um -- you know, they were like, "You have two choices, either, you know, you can, um -- either we can take this from you now or you can, you know, have to go through all this different work" and stuff like that.  So, I do -- I definitely have noticed that, you know -- that they are catching a lot more things so I guess ... [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I mean, you know, I -- I know my father flew about fifteen, twenty years ago to Israel and told me, you know, stories of how they went over every little detail because that country obviously, it's a lot more common and I think just the US is just kinda catching up because the threat is more real.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Um, so I imagine, yes, that they have improved airport security but, as you said, with the --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, the people who actually are in that workforce not, you know, being highly regarded or paid very much, um, obviously it could be better.  I mean, it seems like the -- I mean, I, um -- [LIPSMACK] I went through the airports the year after, uh, nine eleven and my shoes never went off and I just traveled to Chicago for July four and all of a sudden my shoes went off and the guy said to me that they've got new, uh, better machines so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I don't know, now they're picking up the dust on my shoes or something like that so ...
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I mean, I -- I don't know, it's -- it's -- it's so -- you know, it -- there's so much that -- it -- it seems like no matter what we do to prevent things somebody always find something to get around that, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  It -- it just seems like there are, you know -- that -- that evil is always --
R:  Right.
L:  You know, I use that very -- that word very loosely, you know, but that it's just one step ahead --
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  -- um, of -- of whatever preventative measures that we can -- we can use so ...
R:  Yeah, you're right and I think from my last conversation that was kind of what came out of it.  Uh, I said that, you know, we're probably doing too much and he said, well, you know, doing profiling is a really important thing, you know, and we always have to be wary of what's coming next.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, just right now I guess the issue is how much is that going to be an invasion of privacy and, um, you know, are people going to feel, um, like they're always being judged when it -- it's not necess- -- not necessary.
L:  See, to me [MN] profiling and I under -- I understand the concept and I understand, um, using it and everything but that's almost like [SIGH] to me it's -- it's almost like -- how can I explain this?  Um --
R:  Are you against profiling?
L:  Well, I'm trying to explain how I feel about it.
R:  Sure.
L:  Like [COUGH] um, and I always use analogies and I'm trying to think of the best way, but, like, basically what I'm saying is, like, that's like the -- the dumbest thing a criminal could do.  You know what I'm saying?  Is, like, look like a person that they're looking for, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, it's kinda like -- it's kinda -- kinda like saying, uh, if we leave this door open to a store, uh, you know, a -- a -- a -- a criminal's going to come in here and steal everything.
R:  Right.
L:  Let's wait and see till it happens, you know.
R:  Right, right.
L:  And it's kinda, you know, like -- I mean, I under -- I understand that, you know, to -- to be wary and to be watchful but it almost seems like you would think those people would know they're looking for this type of person, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so why would we get that type of person to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, to --
R:  Right.
L:  To -- to be --
R:  Well, I guess -- I guess then what you're say -- I mean, the important thing to, uh, agree upon is that the people who are going to commit these crimes, are not necessarily stupid but they're so extreme that, um, we have to use some method of finding them and, I mean, whether it be metal detectors or, you know, screening personalities and racial backgrounds.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So in that way that -- it's just a different kind of security --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's what, you know, millions and millions of dollars are being invested in right now.  Um, and -- but the problem is that then, you know, you could look down the street and everybody's potentially a -- um, going to, um, be a suspect and that's where it just turns into Big Brother and I think that's what's kinda getting out of control.
L:  Right.
R:  But the guy I talked to last time he was, you know, very, uh, passionate about the fact that, you know, more and more profiling needs to be done because there is so much evil out there.
L:  [MN]
R:  I'm like well, everywhere you look there's going to be evil, you know.
L:  Yeah. [SIGH] Well --
R:  It's like I saw a Bernie Mack TV show where he was saying he was in the elevator and there was this eighty year old woman looking at him and he thought, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- well maybe she could be doing something to him and I -- you -- you -- you can't tell.
L:  Right.  I -- I mean, and I just -- well, look, just as anything, I mean, this is in any case whatsoever.  I mean, you can take it as far as -- as -- as investigations, as your own personal lifestyle, any -- too much of anything is not any good.
R:  Right.
L:  So if you concentrate all your efforts or even too much efforts in one thing it's never going to be productive.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and so -- and that -- that applies to -- to, you know, uh, profiling, you know.  It just -- it -- it's the same concept.
R:  I --
L:  You just can't -- you just can't say, you know, well, as long as we look for these particular people we'll be all right, you know.
R:  Right.  Have you, uh, flown less frequently now?
L:  No, no, no, no.  In fact, in my life I'd only flown probably two or three times before I turned twenty one --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and within the past few years I've probably flown, like, a -- a -- ten times that amount.  I mean, I've -- especially when I was working for -- for VS Imagewear.  I mean, I was -- I was, uh, flying every weekend, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and then on top of that I've just flown more and more because -- especially now that the prices are so low, I mean --
R:  That's true, do --
L:  -- you know.
R:  Well, do you still work for VS Imagewear?
L:  No, we -- you know, the -- as soon as everybody was outfitted -- it was, you know -- it was a short -- we knew it was a short term job, you know, it was --
R:  Oh, right, okay.
L:  It was, you know -- as soon as they all had their -- their uniforms [COUGH] because it was such -- it was such a mass amount of people, that's why they were sending 'em out and stuff like that --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and now that, you know, they're just hiring maybe one, two people a week they can, you know -- they can do their own stuff and --
R:  Sure, sure.
L:  -- send it all in, you know.
R:  Wow.
L:  So -- but, I mean, like we were going, measuring five hundred people at a time.
R:  Wow.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  Have you had any other good topics?
L:  Um, actually this is only my third call, it was --
R:  Yeah, this is only my third call, too. [LAUGH]
L:  And it -- the funny thing is, like, I had -- my first one was probably three months ago --
R:  Yeah, me, too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then I didn't -- I did -- yeah, I -- I didn't get another one until last week I got one and I --
R:  Do you get called or you just don't get the connection?
L:  I just -- I -- I never get called at all.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, probably because you didn't put a whole bunch of different times down.  Is that why?
L: No, I put every single time down.
R:  Oh really?  That's what I do and it calls -- you know, I got fi- -- five, ten messages a day from calls where I wasn't home. [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, what's so funny is, like, the last person I talked to, like, um -- see I'm in [inaudible] and the last person I talked to was this old woman and the topic was, like, hobbies or something --
R:  Right. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and she talked for ever and ever --
