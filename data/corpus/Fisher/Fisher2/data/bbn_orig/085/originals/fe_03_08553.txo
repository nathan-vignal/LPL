R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, this is Lisa, hi.
R:  Hi, um, my name is Jason.  I'm calling from San Francisco, California.
L:  I'm calling from New York.
R:  Wha- wha- what was your name?
L:  Lisa.
R:  Lisa, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think about this increased --
L:  I honestly don't think -- I mean, my opinion is I think they would still be able to do something.  [NOISE] We always had security but I don't think with, like especially living in New York, I don't think that it's that much [NOISE] -- they heighten the security as much.  People -- other people'd still be able to get on a plane, do you think or you don't --
R:  Um, ah, I -- I -- I don't think it hurts.  I mean, if -- if it's going to cost additional money --
L:  Yeah, that's what it is, it's probably going to cost even more and not going to help.
R:  I mean, I -- I might rather just take the chance and have a better meal on the airplane.
L:  Right, yeah, that's true.  You know what it is, everything is with money, that's all it is, you know what I mean?  Everything's about money.
R:  Yeah, but I mean, I -- I, ah, --
L:  See, living in New York, I honestly don't -- don't think that it's going to help by putting a little bit more security, [NOISE] but they are just doing it to make the people feel better, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.  I've done two of these calls already and --
L:  Oh, really, this is my first time.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, and what -- what I wound up saying towards the end of the first phone call, and I'm thinking the same thing now is -- is I'd feel better if they put a security guard, like, towards the cabin or towards the rea- -- one towards the cabin and one towards the rear of the plane.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, yeah, that's what -- that's what a lot of people say, but I don't think that's true.  I definitely agree with that.  I would feel more safe if there was security on the plane, you know what I mean, 'cause that's where -- that's where everything is happening not necessarily inside the airport.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I've flown once since the September eleventh incident.
L:  Really?  See, I've never been on a plane, so --
R:  Huh.
L:  Never been on a plane in my life.  Living in New York you take subways but I've never really been out of the state.  I went to New Jersey.
R:  Huh.
L:  So that would be an experience in itself, you know what I mean?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But if I were, I would definitely -- I definitely agree with you there, I think they should have more security on the plane.  [NOISE]
R:  Huh.  Yeah, I mean, ah, yeah, I know, that's what the question is, is I mean, is about security on airplanes.  It -- it -- I mean, the question isn't about security --
L:  Yeah, secure, yeah.
R:  -- on trains, but I mean, I'd say that's similar, you know.
L:  Yeah, I guess I say that because I live in New York and there's not enough security anywhere, you know when you take trains and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's not enough security.
R:  I mean, there could just as easily be a terrorist attack on train.
L:  Yeah, it could be anywhere.
R:  Huh.
L:  You know, because New York is crazy and they -- they try to put security guards everywhere but I don't think it's going to help because look at September eleventh, look how they did that.  There's always a way I think to slip by, you know what I mean?
R:  There probably is and, ah, --
L:  You know, I mean, we're dealing with smart people here.
R:  Huh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's just my opinion, I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I -- I mean, that -- that's still the way I feel, the way I still feel.
L:  No, but that's -- that's a great opinion.  I agree with you definitely.  That is like -- I said that from the beginning they should have done that [NOISE]
R:  Huh.
L:  I mean, I agree with that one hundred per cent because I would feel a lot better.
R:  I mean, they still, with the half knowledge, it's not just metal detectors but you have to take your shoes off.
L:  Oh, really, I didn't know.  See, I -- I don't take planes so like I said, I don't know.
R:  Yeah, they check you with a, like a metal -- like a handheld metal sensor.
L:  Wow.
R:  It's like a -- they frisk you that way and it's things that, you know, you -- if I had the choice, I'd prefer it wasn't that way, you know, it would --
L:  Yeah, oh, yeah.
R:  -- it would just be you walk through a metal detector.
L:  I'd rather take off my shoes and have to worry -- you know, be more comfortable going on a plane.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it -- it takes extra time and effort and everything else.
L:  Yeah, it's worth it.  In that case I do believe it's worth it.  I never been on a plane but if I'm going to go on one, I would hope it would be secure like that.  I would feel very comfortable if they did it that way.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't know how much it costs though. I mean, I don't know --
L:  Oh, my God, that must -- that must be like very expensive.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I don't know, I mean, you just -- you don't want something like that to happen, right?
L:  No, not at all, and I don't know about there but in New York we're on a budget crisis.  They're cutting things and people in the news and I guess -- I'm hoping they put it towards something like that.  That I wouldn't mind.
R:  Yeah, I mean, it's -- it's this -- I mean, if there's a lot of crime you want police, right?
L:  Right, yes, of course.
R:  You know, it's -- it's -- it's like -- I mean, it might be like an analogy, is if there's a lot of crime --
L:  Yeah, you want something that --
R:  -- in your town, do you want them to put money --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- into the police department, you know?
L:  If you wanted -- if you want them to take budget money, you know, out of something, you want them to put it towards something that is going to be useful for everybody in the, you know, state, in the community.
R:  Mhm, yeah, ah, I mean, ah, I mean, that's the way I feel, is -- is that --
L:  No, I agree.
R:  You know, higher security on airplanes would, ah, would be likely to reduce, ah, terrorism, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  On the, you know, because it just makes sense that if you -- if you put something into it, then you're going to get something out of it.
L:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  As long as they do everything the right way and, you know, if you're going to waste money -- I don't think it's a waste of money though doing that, but a month do it and then it's going to be worth the while, don't just, you know what I mean, like --
R:  Yeah, but then, you know what I was going to say, is -- is, you know, it's, ah, you take a chance crossing the street.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's the same thing, and I mean --
L:  And they say like inward terrorism, you have more chance dying in a car accident than you do on a plane.
R:  That's what I always heard, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess that's what's always true about that.
L:  Yeah, like you have more chance of -- I believe that, yeah, definitely.
R:  Huh.
L:  But, I see, I gotta -- I gotta get over the fear of flying.  I had a fear way before terrorism so I don't know why, but you never know though.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I guess you don't really need to get on an airplane and it's -- it's -- it's more of a hassle, you know, than it used to be.  I mean, I don't fly so often, I've only flown once.
L:  Really since.
R:  You know, since the September eleventh thing so.
L:  You weren't nervous at all or anything.
R:  Ah, no, no, I was only -- I -- there was one time I was on an airplane when I was frightened.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that was on a plane from, um, from Newark, New Jersey.
L:  Okay, that's a very big airport.
R:  To into Providence -- into Providence, Rhode Island.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was -- it was just a small airplane and it was really getting knocked around by the wind.
L:  See, yeah, the small ones, yeah --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I would be afraid of.  I'd rather be on the big one I would feel more comfortable.
R:  And that was the only time I was ever -- I was frightened, you know, because the plane wasn't stable.  It was really moving around and just, you know, it was -- for me it was scary and [LAUGH] I -- I was glad when it was finally on the ground.
L:  No, but you hear more like accidents with the smaller planes.
R:  Is that true?
L:  Than the bigger planes, yeah.
R:  Because -- because that's -- where I am, I'm in California and there was a, you know, a plane crash, you don't want to see something like that happen.
L:  Exactly, yeah.
R:  But it was -- it had something to do with the -- ah, a screw in the tail of the plane that they failed to grease.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, ah, I -- if I remember right, that was on its way from Mexico, ah, into the United States and it crashed down near the Los Angeles area.
L:  Wow.
R:  Not too far from there.  And, ah, you know, that was a mechanical failure, you know, and -- and you don't want to -- if you are going to -- you don't want to see them taking money away from things like that.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  To put them into security, you know, so --
L:  Exactly, that's what I said, take the money out for some things that people can actually use.  And if you're going to do that, put it towards something useful, and if it's going to be towards security, then I think that's great, but if it's going to be for something like, you know, for the mayor like whatever, for his purpose and that, I think that's ridiculous, and they're doing a lot of that here in New York.  I don't know if you're familiar with our mayor, Bloomberg.
R:  That's who you have now is --
L:  Yes, and he's a millionaire as it is.  He's a millionaire this guy and he's taken so much from us to put it other places, but it's like since he came in, nobody likes him.
R:  Yeah, well, I never heard a bad thing about -- it was Guillano[?] before, right?
L:  No, Guillano, I -- I had no problem with Guillano, no problem whatsoever.  They say he was racist but I don't know.  I mean --
R:  He's -- he's kind of a -- a tough act to follow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I never heard a bad thing about him so --
L:  Exactly.  They say Bloomberg is more for himself because he's a millionaire, so he don't really care.  I don't know.  That's what I'm, you know, that's what I'm hearing.  I'm not too much into politics.  So --
R:  Huh, there's one airport in New York, right, or is there --
L:  No, there's several actually.  There's La Guardia, there's Kennedy, and is that it?  I think there's another one, no, I'm thinking of Newark, So yeah, La Guardia and Kennedy.
R:  Yes, are they both -- are they in different burroughs or are they both in the city?
L:  No, they're both in Queens, just -- just different parts of Queens.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah, we don't have none in Brooklyn, we don't have, you know, that's it, just Queens.
R:  That -- that kind of surprises me because so if you're going to fly into New York, it wouldn't make much of much of a difference.
L:  No, so like I would say not even maybe a half hour apart from each other.
R:  Huh.
L:  They are very close to each other.  The next one we have is Newark, that's the closest one to New York -- to Manhattan.
R:  Huh.
L:  Yeah.  But -- but I think Newark is the biggest one.  La Guardia is like the smallest one I'm pretty sure, so Newark is like they definitely need extra security because they do international.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I, it doesn't hurt to put the money into security.
L:  No.
R:  It's just you don't want to see them.
L:  I think if people are going to be safe and, you know, and, you know, do what you have to do.
R:  Huh.
L:  That, I wouldn't mind, you know, like I said, but if it's going towards something that people, you know, are not getting nothing out of then, you know, I don't agree with it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they haven't really mentioned too much about that on the news, but I have heard about them, you know, with security.  You know, all I know is they're having no problem, [COUGH] excuse me, they haven't had no problems so far, you know.  So they are -- they are a lot more strict I must say, as far as checking people's bags and what not.  You know, I don't know how it is in California, but I guess because this is where we got, you know, this is where it happened, September eleventh, that's probably why they're doing it.
R:  Mm.
L:  How is the -- um, how is the security in
