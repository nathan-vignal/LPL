L:  Hi.  My name is Pat Boss.  I'm in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Who am I speaking to?
R:  Hi.  This is Jean Fisher.  I'm in Branford, Connecticut.
L:  Hi Jean.  How are you today?
R:  [LAUGH] I'm good.  How are you?
L:  You said Jean, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hi.
L:  Well, how are you today?
R:  Good thanks.
L:  Oh.
R:  How are you?
L:  Oh.  Good.  Good.
R:  Good.
L:  Well, so this is, sort of, a hot topic, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] I guess, a- -- I'll go first and --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- say that, um, I'm not happy with the situation in the Middle East --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in particular, um, what's going on in Iraq.
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, [LIPSMACK] not that I don't think that we should try to seek peace but I'm not happy that we're losing so many American lives --
R:  Right.
L:  -- i- i- in, um -- in an effort that so many people disapprove of.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Including the people that are participating. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, how do you feel about that?
R:  Um, I basically feel the same way.  And I just had a niece who just came back from Afghanistan and she's scarred for life and she was only there for two months.
L:  You mean emotionally?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Na- --
R:  N- --
L:  Was she physically hurt?
R:  Um, no.  She came back with TB. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.
R:  Um, with their training with antibiotics.  But -- yeah, emotionally.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Right.  Um, she's, like, nineteen.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  So -- but, you know, that's -- oh, it's -- it's a hard call and I don't know what you do but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um --
L:  Yeah.  I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, although I -- as much as I think what was going on in Iraq was deplorable --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I think that our basic premise for being there, um, just didn't seem to pan out.
R:  Right.
L:  And now it looks like, maybe, it was intentional -- intentionally misrepresented to the public.
R:  Mm.
L:  I don't know.  I wasn't there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  All we really know is what we hear from the media, which is pretty skewed one way or the other, depending on who you're listening to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] Or y- -- or -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Who -- who you're reading, right?
R:  Yeah.  Right.
L:  Well --
R:  Ah --
L:  I don't know -- when you came on, um, did they tell you what sort of things we should be talking about?  Like, I jotted down three things.  Um, what do I think about the situation?  Do I think peace will ever be attained?  And should the US be involved?  Is that -- did you get that from --
R:  That's what -- that's what she said.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  All right.  Well, do you thing that peace is ever gonna be attained in the Middle East?
R:  [SIGH] No. [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Well, we're on the same page with that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, do you have a, um -- a Christian upbringing?
R:  Yeah.  R- -- ah, Roman Catholic.
L:  And so, was part of your training regarding the Middle East that there'll never be peace there?  I mean, 'cause I was -- I was raised in a Christian home and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and m- my bible study r- -- was that there's never gonna be peace in the Middle East.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I don't think we should stop trying, it's just, like --
R:  Right.
L:  -- people are never gonna be, ah -- never not going to die from certain car accidents but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't l- -- wear our seatbelts.
R:  Sure.  Sure.
L:  You know?  But, um -- but, you know, they --
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't -- I don't think there's ever gonna be peace there.  They're just gonna keep fighting and whatever.  Hm.
L:  Um, do you have any reason why you think that peace isn't gonna ever -- I mean, like, I said mine was [LAUGH] -- was, basically, [LAUGH] biblical but I mean, do you have some other thoughts on that?
R:  No.  Just -- just the history.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's the way it's always been.
L:  Of the a- -- the history of the region, right?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Um, I mean, it has -- the history of the region really has gone right along with what, I recall -- that the Bible has talked about.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, and, um -- but again, I mean, I'm quick to say that doesn't mean we shouldn't wear our seatbelts, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  Ah, I think that -- that we should do what we can but, again, we're -- we're swing back to the reason that we're there right now --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- was to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.
R:  Right.
L:  Not to bring peace to the region, not to, um, ah, address the, um, crimes against humanity, you know, that were taking place there, but to get rid of these weapons of mass destruction.  And now, we can't seem to f- find any evidence --
R:  Find them.
L:  -- of that.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  Right.
L:  Should we just get out?  Um, I don't think we can.  You know, our b- -- our people are -- will not be safe.  The -- you know, the people in Iraq wouldn't be safe so I --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I don't know what [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you think that the US should've been involved in the first place?
R:  Um, probably not but we always get involved.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  We can't seem to keep our fingers out of the pie.
R:  Right.  Right.  Definitely.
L:  Um, they didn't ask us th- -- you know, they didn't say this in the setup but you remember when the, um -- the UN was involved and then there was supposed to have been this resolution and then another resolution?  Do you think that the US acted improperly by not following what the UN -- what the UN's conclusion --
R:  Um --
L:  -- was?
R:  Y- -- could you repeat that?  I'm sorry, 'cause I was --
L:  Well, you know -- re- remember the -- when they g- -- um, [LIPSMACK] when the UN inspectors were first sent into Iraq to look for these weapons of mass destruction, that was under a resolution and the resolution said that if they didn't find anything, um, or depending on what the findings were, that then, ah, failure to comply with the inspections on the part of Iraq --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- s- -- I'm just taking this off the top of my head --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would mean that w- we could go ahead and beg- -- and take positive steps toward eliminating the weapons of mass destruction without getting another resolution from the UN.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  I mean, that was Bush's position.
R:  Right.
L:  And there were a lotta people, including France, who said, "Hey --" and Germany that said you need a UN resolution in order to have permission to go in and Bush said, "No, I don't.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The original resolution says we're allowed to do it if Saddam doesn't comply with the terms of the inspections".  So, I just wondered how you felt about that or if you don't remember anything about ...? [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I -- I do remember but, um, you know, I'm just, kinda, frustrated with the whole -- the whole thing that we haven't found anything and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't know.  I wish we could just get outta there.
L:  And now, g- -- u- um, I'm not sure that Liberia is really the Middle East but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [SIGH] But it --
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean, it sh- -- it's, like, well, we couldn't -- seems to me like we couldn't, um, [PAUSE] [SIGH] -- we couldn't do anything that we could be -- that Bush could be r- -- proud of.  Ah, I'm not -- maybe that's not the right way to say it but -- but so now, let's go to Liberia and see if we can -- see if we can do something there.
R:  Mm.
L:  And what do you think about that?
R:  It was strange.  Um, I don't know. [PAUSE] I don't know.  What was the last part of this topic we're supposed to do?
L:  Well, that -- ah, th- there was just, um, three things, you know, what do we think about the situation in the Middle East?  Um, will there -- will peace ever be attained?
R:  Right.
L:  And should the US be involved?
R:  Mm.
L:  And so, since we both, sort of, agree that, you know, maybe the US ought not to be as involved as they are --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- I was just taking the question to, um -- 'cause we got ten minutes we gotta, you know, use up.
R:  Sure.
L:  So, I was just, kinda, moving across the -- the map to Liberia.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because we're getting ready to -- to send troops there too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um --
R:  Maybe I'm not real familiar with Liberia right now.
L:  Well, they have a -- they have a leader named Taylor --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- who has been -- if I remember correctly -- a dictator for his entire time there and the people are living -- living in complete poverty.  I mean, like in -- in something that we don't even see in Appalachia here in the United States.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And he has agreed to step down and let a new government take over if peace keeping forces will be allowed to come in.  And so, we're thinking, "Okay".  I'm just -- I'm just saying, "We" you know, meaning Washington --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- thinking, "Well, all right, we'll send some troops in there to be the peace keeping force".  But I think that we ought to have some other countries involved in this.  Like, um, e- -- if not other countries, at least the UN --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  -- and the American Red Cross and --
R:  Right.
L:  Y- you know?  'Cause we had all, like, the -- all this talk in Iraq about how happy the people were gonna be to see us.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And yet they're still killing us. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  How happy can some of 'em be if they're --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- still -- still killing us off at the rate of -- of one American per day.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Although, um, I did hear today --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that the, um -- one of the new Iraqi councils that was set up with all Iraqis on the -- on the council, um -- it's a governing body and I -- I forget which city it was in but they declared April ninth as a national holiday --
