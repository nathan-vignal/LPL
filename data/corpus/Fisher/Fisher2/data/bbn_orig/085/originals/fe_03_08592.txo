L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yeah.  Ah, hi, this is Hoesch[?].
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  My name is Hoesch.
R:  Yes.  My name is Ullianna[?]. Ah, --
L:  Ullianna?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Ah, where are you in, ah, USA?
R:  Ah, New York.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have a friend called Ullianna.  She is here and, ah, nearby in Ohio.  I'm -- I'm from Ohio.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Okay.  So, what's the topic for today?
R:  [NOISE]  I -- I -- I didn't really understand what the topic.  Wait a second, I have to close the window because I don't hear anything.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Are you from Middle East yourself?
R:  I'm -- I'm from where?
L:  Whe- where are you from originally?  You don't sound --
R:  I'm originally from Russia.
L:  Russia?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm --
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm from India originally.
R:  Okay.
L:  And the friend I was talking about, Ullianna, she's from, ah, Romania.
R:  Mhm.  Okay.
L:  Okay, so I think we should talk about the Middle East.
R:  Ahah.
L:  What do you think about, ah, Middle East?
R:  Middle East?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do I think about Middle East?  Ah, [LIPSMACK] well, what -- what actually just, ah, -- can you be more, ah, specific what country or something?
L:  I -- well, they didn't say about which country we should talk about but --
R:  Like --
L:  -- general Middle East, like --
R:  Like Iraq or Iran?
L:  Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, that area.
R:  Well, I think they have to be left alone.  I think they have to -- they have to live by their rules and I think America should get out of there and, ah, I think the war in Iraq was very unfair and, ah, I think, ah, America wanted oil there and America wanted control there and they still want it and they still doing it, so they're chasing 'cause no good.  That's what I think about that.
L:  I agree with that but I don't think that, ah, ah, they should be left alone because if left alone they are going to do another of September eleven things.  [NOISE]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And although America's attack there was unfair and whatever they did was for getting oil and control, but I think, ah, Iraq needed a new leadership.  Maybe not American, maybe, ah, another Iraqi leader or something but definitely they needed a new leadership.  [NOISE]
R:  Well, I -- I don't know.  I think they have, ah, -- they have their own leadership there.  They have all -- all their own leaders there also and they had them before, not like Saddam Hussein or something, but, ah, they have some other and they are very religious people which, um, which is, um, [LIPSMACK] very hard for Americans, I guess, because still, ah, there is some soldiers dying them, American soldiers, and, ah, um, Iraqi people also dying their for their pride.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um, their culture is very diff- different from Americas and very old which is, I think, very hard for Americans to understand that and to deal with it also.  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the big problem there.  It's the same kind of thing as going on in Israel and the Palestinia[?] also, like this long time conflict going -- going on there and people are dying and they're killing each other.  I think it should be stopped somehow also and, ah, maybe, ah, war in, ah, Israel, between Israel and Palestinia should be stopped by America, but I don't think America had enough, um, rights to go to Iraq instead of going to, for example, to Israel and solve a conflict there.
L:  Mhm.  So do you, being a Russian, do all Russians, ah, think like that?  Are Russians --
R:  Ah, --
L:  -- against the US and -- and their invading of Iraq?
R:  I think most of Russians are thinking the same way, yeah, like me.  They're -- they're thinking negatively about, ah, America invading Iraq and, um, they -- they think kind of same about the Israeli Palestinia conflict also, that -- that there's also there is not unfair -- not fair, I mean.  Something going on there and, um, yeah, I think so.  Most of Russians -- in Russia they think like that and most of Russians here in America they think like that also.
L:  So you -- do you study here or are you working here?
R:  Well, I am American citizen.  Ah, I'm -- I'm living here long time, ah, but -- yeah, I'm working here.
L:  Okay.
R:  I -- I finished school.  Um, I'm a graphic designer.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  But, ah, I still hold my own opinion, I mean, about, ah, this issue.  I -- I don't say America is very bad country or something, but I think some problems they -- they -- I don't know, some problems in other countries they probably shouldn't go there, especially --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- against, um, like, countries like, I don't know, like in Yugoslavia for example it was the same kind of thing, ah, which is, ah, -- I don't think positively about this.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I mean, the US has a history of invading other countries and establishing control over there and, ah, forcing their, ah, their society and their social values there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- which is probably causing all this anti US, ah, rhetoric everywhere but, ah, I don't know if the US is to be blamed for that because, ah, everyone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- envies US's economic success and they are -- I think they are partially they are against the US because of their success and they are not able to, ah, match that success.
R:  Yeah, but, you know what, ah, I have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I have like a friends in my school, I -- I just finished school and I had friends, students.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Most of them, most of those people are Americans and they -- nobody would -- I asked, like, a lot of people there in the schools, students, what do they think about war in Iraq for example and, ah, nobody was positive.  That's, ah, I don't understand, like, ah, like public opinion was very positive about Americans going to Iraq but what I -- my experience of asking people around wasn't that positive.  Nobody liked it, but nobody actually cared much.  I mean, they were scared, they were like, um, nervous what was going to happen, economy will go down or something, you know.  Everybody was afraid but everybody told that they cannot do anything, they cannot change anything about it.  Nothing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And that's also I feel the same, that I cannot change anything.  My voice will not change anything.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I mean, individuals cannot do anything about a whole country, but, ah, I don't know, but I think Iraq is seeing improvement already after the US invasion [NOISE].  The oil production there has improved [NOISE] and, ah, ah, there has -- peace has been restored in the city as such, although the Americans and the Iraqi soldiers are being killed but as such there is peace in the city and the people are happier now.
R:  You think so?
L:  That's what I read in the magazines.  I don't know how much that's true.
R:  Hm.
L:  But that is what the magazines say.
R:  Hm.  Well, --
L:  Why, you --
R:  -- that's what the magazines said, but, ah, I don't know.  I read then for example in Russian newspaper I read, ah, completely, ah, different materials, you know, about that nothing is good there and, ah, Ira- Ira- -- people in Iraq are not liking Americans and they are saying get out of there.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And they don't like them, they don't want them there.  Yes, they wanted them to free them from the Saddam Hussein regime, but they don't want them there now.
L:  But isn't that selfish?  That you --
R:  It's -- it is -- it is selfish but I think they were kind of --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's -- they couldn't get rid of Saddam Hussein regime themselves so they -- they were happy to get American help but they didn't really need it, you know.  They --
L:  Well, I think they definitely needed it.  They were not able to get Saddam Hussein out themselves then they definitely needed help from outside, and after getting that -- that help, ah, I think, ah, since US, ah, ah, lost so many people, so many soldiers in the war and they had-- they've spent so much of money in the war to free Iraqi people, they deserve a share of the pie, and they deserve to have, ah, some control over there.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Not just because they freed them but also for their own security.  I mean, ah, because all these fanatics come from, ah, ah, the Middle East countries like Iraq, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, and they need --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- [inaudible] they need security by having their own control there in a way without [inaudible] dictate, ah, then, but they should have some control there.
R:  I -- I think they don't, ah, maybe they need it but they don't want it because every country wants to be free from some- somebody's else, ah, --
