L:  [NOISE]
R:  Hi.  Are you there?
L:  Yes.  I'm here.
R:  Hi.  I'm Tracey.
L:  Hi Tracey.  I'm Florence.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, I guess we're discussing airport security tonight?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  I haven't flown in forever. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I've flown, um -- I went to California and, ah, the security was excellent.  I really appreciated the fact that, um, they took all their time and checked out everything.
R:  Oh, really?  Now, did it hold you up a lot?
L:  Well, I -- but I appreciated it because the fact that they did check us and then when you went on the flight, you knew that there wasn't gonna be an -- a -- a terrorist anything, you know?  There was gonna be nothing that would, ah, terrify you and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that they really checked everybody for all kinds of, um, you know, guns, knives, et cetera.
R:  Right.
L:  And n- -- and you wouldn't have any incidences on the plane.
R:  But don't you worry, like, they don't -- they don't check everyone's shoes.  Y- -- at our p- -- airport I think it's probably --
L:  Yeah.  Well, a lotta that's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah.  I know.
L:  I mean --
R:  But, like, what if --
L:  What are you gonna do?  Hold somebody up with a razor? [LAUGH]
R:  Ex- -- [LAUGH]
L:  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.  But what if they have explosives in their shoes and you were the f- -- you know, if they check every third person and the person --
L:  Who could walk with C four?
R:  -- with explosives was the second?
L:  But who could walk with C four in a shoe?
R:  Well, that's --
L:  And not explode themselves?
R:  [LAUGH] Pow!  Well, I guess he had explosives. [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, it just doesn't make sense. [LAUGH]
R:  Now --
L:  You know --
R:  Your airports, since nine eleven, have -- are you all still allowed to go up to the gate to greet people or say goodbye or do you have to meet them in baggage?
L:  Oh, no.  Baggage.
R:  Yeah.  See, they -- they used to -- I'm -- I remember when the Gulf War was going on -- the first one -- that w- -- at that point, we could only greet them at baggage and then --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- after the war ended, we could go back to meeting up at the gate.  And then, since nine eleven, it's changed to going back to you have to meet them at baggage.
L:  Yeah.  I think, um, when I've, ah -- in eighty two I flew El Al to Israel.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  And -- uh-huh.  And, um, I was -- I was amazed at the wonderful security they had and they were aware of this problem so much lo- -- ah, you know, ah, long before we were in the States.
R:  Now, that's what my husband said.  He went to Israel, um, I think it's been almost nine years ago now.
L:  Oh, look at that.
R:  A- -- yeah.  I know.  And he said he flew out of -- I can't remember, which or -- um, airport in New York but it was from New York.  He took a flight --
L:  Yes.  Mine too.
R:  -- from Florida then y- -- to New York --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then he flew out.  Um, and he said, you know, at the Israel Airport, there were, ah, military people everywhere.
L:  Everywhere.  Uh-huh.
R:  He said you'd go to the bathroom and there'd be some guy with a gun slung, you know?  He said, "But I didn't worry about anything happening to me".
L:  Exactly.  You felt safe.  I mean, just think of the poor people in Israel.  You know, they never know if their kids gonna get on a bus or a relative or a friend is gonna get on a bus or your husband that, you know, they're not gonna be blown to smithereens.  It's horrific.  So, um, I like all the precautions they take and I like the alerts that they let us know about.
R:  [MN] O- --
L:  I -- I just think it's important.
R:  Right.  No.  Like, I don't understand these people that say, "Oh, well, we're losing our liberty to keep up security".
L:  Oh.
R:  But I would rather f- -- loose a few personal liberties --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- t- -- and be safe than it be absolutely, completely free to do as I want and have to wonder.
L:  Absolutely.  I so agree with you.
R:  'Cause, you know, I mean, w- well, before -- i- it's a wonder this didn't happen before nine eleven.
L:  That's r- -- yeah.
R:  I mean, it's just a wonder.
L:  I -- I'm amazed.  I guess they waited because they realized we were so ignorant and had our heads in the clouds that they didn't have to worry about any, kind of, um, u- undercover stuff much, you know?  I mean, they -- they were blatantly taking flying lessons et cetera.  You know? [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Y- -- I live in Florida and they were, um -- it turned out they lived not too many [LAUGH] f- -- counties over from me.
L:  I know.  I'm a f- -- I'm from Florida too, so --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  Yeah.  And, ah -- yeah.  That -- that was amazing to me.  That was amazing.
R:  N- -- see, and I, kinda, worry about, like, th- -- our airport security here because of the President's brothers are -- you know, the Governor.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, I always wonder if -- you know?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I have a son living in Tampa --
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  A- -- uh-huh.
R:  Oh, that's where I live.
L:  And where you hear about that as being the Head of Command, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  I --
R:  R- -- my hu- -- yeah, my husband, um, his job used to be right down the street from MacDill.
L:  Oh, right.
R:  Yeah.  And, um, sometimes, my kids -- my kids are frequently in the hospital.  I have foster kids so they don't have the best care so they get sick quite frequently and I remember right when nine one one happened, the hospital we use is right down the street from MacDill and I remember [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- telling my husband, "If the kids get sick today we're taking 'em to a different county to go to the hospital". [LAUGH]
L:  Wow.
R:  We're -- we're not going to this hos- --
L:  And what was wrong with them?
R:  Oh, they have asthma and stuff like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- isn't it better in a -- a dry place like Arizona or California?
R:  You would think so but I'm, like, attached to my mother so I'm not moving. [LAUGH]
L:  Ah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] So, I --
L:  I have a daughter in law that lives with me now and -- and, ah, they're looking -- my son and daughter in law and the three kids -- she just had a new baby -- they're --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- looking for a place and they're not too sure.  They know they wanna -- they didn't wanna live in Miami anymore and we used to live in Mi- -- we lived in Miami for twenty seven years and, um, talk about, you know, ah, things happening.  Ah, but, um, ah, they didn't wanna bring up the kids in Miami so they moved out here and we're in the middle of the state and they said, "Can we stay with you until we find a place that we can live, a- -- you know, that we like, s- -- w- -- school system and everything else and, um -- and a job?"  And I said, "Sure".  And so, it's -- you know, she always says, "Gee, I really appreciate you being here" you know?
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  I- --
R:  So, you live in Florida now?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  We're retired in Florida.  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We live at -- we live right outside of Tampa.
L:  Oh, you're close to me.
R:  Oh, am I?
L:  Ah, yeah.  We're Sebring.  Ah --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  My kid lives in, um, Temple Terrace.
R:  Oh, okay.  We were just in Temple Terrace tonight -- we went to Bush Gardens.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  He lives a couple of miles from there.
R:  Yup.
L:  And, um, it's really s- -- now, that's another story -- how about that terrorist that they found in Temple Terrace?
R:  Oh, did -- I didn't hear about that, believe it or not.
L:  Oh, this was a -- a, um -- a, um -- a Muslim --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they're supposed to have a pretty heavy duty mosque there and, ah, the --
R:  Right.  There's a -- yeah.  There's a Islamic school around there, I believe.
L:  Uh-huh.  And the fellow who is the Chief of Police, ah, him and his wife sit my little, ah, granddaughter and, ah -- the one that lives in Temple Terrace -- and he was the one who got all this information about this guy.  And, um, you know, I -- I -- I -- he's just my hero because he reported it and this guy got, you know, arrested --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and taken out of the college that he was in.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  He was a real heavy duty -- a Muslim activist and terror- -- ah, you know, terror plotting stuff.
R:  Unbelievable.
L:  It was awful.  Yeah.  So, talk about, ah, you know, air- airports, I'm just -- I'm thrilled that we're taking such precautions.  Now, one thing was, kinda, dumb.  I'm sitting there on the chair and the -- the lady is taking her baton and going over my bare feet --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- over and --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- over again as if, "What?  Did I put something under my skin?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Sh- -- between my toes?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Can you not see my shoes are off?"
R:  See, that's my fear -- I'd go to the airport and forget I had on my toe ring or something, you know? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But that's -- you know.  Th- -- big deal.  Well, okay.  Well, how much explosive can you put in a toe ring?
R:  Exactly. [LAUGH]
L:  You know, I mean, it's so -- it's so ridiculous.  But I mean -- and, you know, some of the stuff they pull or, you know, they say, well, ah -- we got pulled over twice and we s- -- we complained and we said, "Well, what is this?"  Because we waited on one line, we got pulled over and then we w- -- going on the plane and we got pulled over.  And we said, "What is this?"  Oh, well, if you have a red zero or an extra number in your, ah, ticket [NOISE] -- you know, boarding pass, [NOISE] ah, it's a random thing and they'll pull you over.  Well, that was annoying.  That was the only annoying, random nonsense that I -- that bothered me.
R:  And besides that, now you know how it works and if -- god forbid -- if you did have connections, you'd call someone and say, you know, "If your -- if your number ends with the red number --"
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "-- scrap the plan" right?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Don't attack. [LAUGH] They're gonna come get ya.
L:  Oh.  It's silly.  But otherwise, I mean, it's okay.  I -- I like to -- I like to know that I'm flying and there's gonna be --
R:  Now, my mom s- --
L:  -- and I'm not gonna blow up.
R:  Right.  Now, my mom said it's ridiculous because when she went to Ohio last time, when she flew, she said they're pulling little old ladies out of the line to check their shoes, you know?  My mom's, like, "Come on".
L:  Hey, listen --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in Israel, they -- they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- make themselves up as, ah, Orthodox rabbis so who's not to say a little old lady with old shoes --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- couldn't become a terrorist?  Hey, I don't -- I don't doubt anything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?  I don't -- I don't put it past them.  Don't give me the little old ladies.  That's okay.  Check 'em all.
R:  [LAUGH] Check 'em all.
L:  Check 'em all. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?  Don't let anybody get away with anything. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But they search your car and everything?
L:  A- -- pardon me?
R:  They search your car and everything too when you're on your way into the airport?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  No one ever searched our car.  I mean, what's our car gonna do?  The people gonna drop us off --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and then [NOISE] -- who opened up our trunk? [NOISE] My husband said somebody dro- -- up to -- opened up his trunk as he drove into the driveway of something.  I don't know. [NOISE] The airport.  Well, that never happens to me.  Well, I get dropped off by somebody so, ah -- you know, it doesn't matter.  My suitcases come out and I go check in. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  Now, we were in Central America right after nine eleven happened [NOISE] -- we had to go on a trip -- and, ah, actually, we went to, ah, Columbia, South America and, um, they were very strict in, ah -- in Colum- --
