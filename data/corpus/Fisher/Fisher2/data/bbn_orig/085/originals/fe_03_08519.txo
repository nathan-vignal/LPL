R:  Hi, this is Bob.
L:  Hi, this is Cynthia.
R:  Cynthia.
L:  Yes.
R:  This is Bob.
L:  Okay, hi.
R:  What do you think of the base- -- baseball strike and NBA strike?
L:  What?  Excuse me?
R:  What do you think of the baseball strike for using [inaudible] and the strike in the NBA to get the players want more money?
L:  I think it's ludicrous.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  They shouldn't -- I don't like baseball though, so it doesn't really matter[?]
R:  You don't like baseball?
L:  No, and um, they get paid too much for -- for two hours on TV.
R:  That's right.  That's where they get all their money, from TV I think.  They don't get all that money from all the fans.
L:  [inaudible] I think twenty million is too much.
R:  For Rodriguez, you mean?
L:  Too much for all of them -- all of them.  They get paid --
R:  Oh yeah, they make that amount of money?
L:  They make too much.
R:  I think they ought to be accountable for the -- for the team's performance.
L:  Excuse me?
R:  If they're going to pay a man twenty thousand dollars to join their team, if they don't win -- if they don't have a winning season or um, ah, [several inaudible words] or bring in fans or make money, then they ought to be -- be able to fire him.
L:  Oh.  Well then I think I should start taking up baseball so I can make a lot of money.  A lot, a lot, a lot.  You like baseball, don't you?
R:  I like basebal- -- I like -- I like college basketball the most.
L:  Do you -- do you -- do you think they deserve to get paid that much?
R:  They don't get paid anything to play college basketball.
L:  College basketball don't get paid anything?  I think there is um, is there a law going under that -- under that?
R:  College, the students, you mean?
L:  Yeah, college --
R:  College -- college basketball doesn't -- the students are on scholarship.
L:  They get scholarships?
R:  Yeah, they get scholarships.
L:  To the colleges that they're going to?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well that's not money, that's like, furthering their education.
R:  It's supposed to.
L:  What?  So you're saying it don't?
R:  I don't know whether it does it not but they get special treatment.
L:  Yeah, they all do.  I don't think all of them do, I think like, the main star players get special treatment.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well that's all right -- that's all right, but professional players they can make them strike for more money is ridiculous.
L:  Ah, do -- do you think LeBron -- do you think LeBron James deserves that Nike deal?
R:  Well, apparently he's got the name recognition and Nike wanted to pay him, so, more power to LeBron James he got a good contract out of Nike.
L:  Hey, I have no problem with him but if he doesn't live up to the hype --
R:  He won't.
L:  He won't?
R:  Not for several years.  He's just come out of high school.  He was the only [several inaudible words] in the NBA level.
L:  Well, okay, so say he doesn't win a ring for his team, well that's like -- worst -- I don't know, that's like [several inaudible words] but it could happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, would you think now, then he deserves it?
R:  If he did that -- if he did that he would be worth every penny to them, I guess.
L:  Okay.  Well, one person can't bring the whole team to the -- to the final, so 
R:  What about Michael Jordan?
L:  Michael Jordan has key players.  It wasn't only him.
R:  Well, he brought that team around over a period of ten years.
L:  Yeah, he did but there are other key players in that -- that --
R:  There was, ah, Scotty Peplin[?] and others.
L:  There was Scotty Peplin --
R:  They were all -- they were all key.
L:  Yeah, it's not only him, but you know, you need a team to play.  He couldn't do it by himself.
R:  That's right.
L:  So Michael Jordan was worth every penny though because [LAUGH] he de- -- he lived up to the heights. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, he was, wasn't he?
L:  Okay.
R:  Well I -- I say if they can get -- if they get -- if the players can ah, bring in the money for the team or the sport, or the team to pay 'em, or if the fans are that interested in seeing 'em or watching the team play on television or in the stands, okay, well, um, then they should pay them that, but when it gets to that point that they're not making -- when they're not -- when the owner's sticking it into his own pocketbook, then, well 
L:  Okay.
R:  See what I mean?
L:  Yeah.  I understand completely.
R:  If they don't -- if they can't earn their money they don't deserve.
L:  If they don't earn their money, what?
R:  They don't deserve to get paid that kind of money.
L:  Although if that doesn't happen, they still get paid no matter if they don't do anything they do anything.
R:  To get [several inaudible words] deserve it.
L:  So -- so --
R:  [several inaudible words] chapter eleven or bankruptcy expecting to be paid thirty million dollars for it, so they fire him and he had bought -- he had a contract or a severance agreement he gets paid, but then he's out of a job so they've got to pay him a bit more.
L:  Oh.  So -- so which point do you think deserves, like, players being paid high?  Should like, get all the money that, you know, whenever they have any contracts? 
R:  They have to get the contract first.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  So like, oh, okay.  Wow.  I don't think -- I don't think any person should be paid twenty million dollars to play a game.  I think people --
R:  Especially baseball.  [several inaudible words] a strenuous game.
L:  No, I think they will --
R:  They stand around out there most of the time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Stand around, hit the ball, run.  A catcher deserves more money than -- than a outfielder, I would think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He has to catch all those -- they have to play almost every day and squat round the back plate[?] get hit by balls, bats, players, everything.  They take a beating back there.  They should be paid more.  But these other players, they just stand around the outfield or infield, the ball gets hit to him maybe five times a game, that's about as -- then they get to enjoy batting.
L:  See, like, you see, people who are paid a lot lose focus of, you know, like, what they are doing that sport for.  I think people play sports now because they get paid so high because of money.
R:  Right.
L:  I think they lose focus of -- because -- because I love this game.  It's like Michael Jordan, he loved the game.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't think -- I think if he got paid two dollars he would still be who he is, because he loves the game, but I think a lot of people now, they lose sight.  It was like, [several inaudible words] he must be in the Mets because of a ring.  He's like, fighting for a ring now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Come on now.  I think they should have a new rule.  If you play for twenty years in those games they should give you a ring automatically.
R:  [LAUGH] That's how to achieve an award ring, yeah?
L:  Yeah, you earned it for playing for twenty years in the team, I give you a ring. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah right.
L:  Going away present.
R:  But they paid you twenty million dollars a year to play too.
L:  Yeah, but like, the money can't buy them a ring.  I would make myself a specially made ring.
R:  You do?
L:  No, I would.
R:  Oh, you would make your own ring?
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah but -- okay.
R:  Some of these players have four rin- -- four and five rings.
L:  Who?
R:  For baseball.  Michael Jordan has six of 'em.
L:  So for baseball they get rings also?
R:  Oh baseball do, they get rings for winning the world series, yeah.
L:  Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.  I just thought that you get a nice --
R:  Football, baseball, basketball.  All those sports.  
L:  What about football players?
R:  They get a ring for winning the main championship.
L:  Oh.  What about --
R:  Every player, and the coach, and manager, and executive on the team gets a ring.
L:  Yeah.  I think even -- even --
R:  I don't know if the secretaries do, but I think all the rest of them do.
L:  Okay.  No, because um, I met a scout that was for the Giants, the NSO, he got a ring also, even the scout --
R:  Oh, he did too?
L:  The scout -- the scout even gets a ring.
R:  Is that right?
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  I didn't know that.
L:  [several inaudible words]
