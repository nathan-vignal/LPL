L:  Hi.
R:  Hello, my name is Tanya.
L:  [MN] Tanya, hi, I'm Judy -- how are you?
R:  I'm okay.
L:  Good, so, how do you feel about the topic?
R:  Um, I really haven't been affected too much by this strike, by professional actors, but, I really can't see the cause for it.
L:  [SIGH] You know, I thought they said athletes [LAUGH].
R:  I thought it was actors.
L:  You may be right.
R:  Okay.
L:  You may be right.
R:  Well, either one, I really can't see the cause f- -- well, moreso --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with people in the athletic field --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I could see a strike, but not, actors.
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, yeah.  No, I've not been -- I don't know, I remember some years ago, when there was a, ah, strike of actors, and that was an issue --
R:  That's what I thought -- it wasn't recent.
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay, so it's not recent, but, no --
L:  No.
R:  -- they -- they -- I mean, you get the recognition from the fans --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you get the recognition from --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- everybody, and the pay?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't --
L:  I know.
R:  -- I don't see the cause for a strike.
L:  I should get a fraction of that pay.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Imagine, 'cause you'll --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- probably do more of the work than they're doing anyway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some people, and everything else, I don't -- I don't understand that.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, I don't understand it either, I think it's [LAUGH] -- you know, probably if you're the actor, and you're in it -- they probably feel that they have a real good reason for striking -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I just never understood it.
R:  I -- I really can't see --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, you get so much notoriety, I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- people just wanna give you stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you get so much money for being in the movie, then you -- after being in the movie you get so much endorsements from people who want you to sell their product, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, why would you strike?  I mean, you can't possibly --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- be striking for more money.
L:  No, no --
R:  You can't.
L:  -- but, if you have a job like that, it's like hitting the lottery.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [LAUGH] It's like --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- be grateful for what you have -- you're not working in a factory, you're not working flipping burgers.
R:  You have --
L:  Enjoy it.
R:  -- people catering to you.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, you have a hairdresser, you have a makeup artist, you have --
L:  And the wardrobe, yeah.
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And people are giving you clothes because they want so and so to be seen in their clothes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so that they can become a up and coming designer -- what is there to strike about?
L:  Oh, I know, I know -- I just don't get it -- [SIGH] never did.
R:  I mean, working conditions, I mean, you don't do the hard stuff, you have --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, people for that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you have gophers --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you have, ah, producers, and everybody else, I -- I -- I can't see the -- the point.
L:  Well, heaven forbid, they probably do have to work hard, and they probably work long hours, but look at the compensation.
R:  Exactly.
L:  [NOISE] You know, and that's the thing that I just don't understand, and, you know, when they did strike, I don't remember what it was all about -- I don't remember why.
R:  I don't remember why either --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, it can't be for money -- 
L:  No.
R:  -- your kids are set for life --
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  -- you're set for life, probably --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your grandkids, if you manage well --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  I -- I really don't unders- -- and, like you said, I can't remember what that was all about.
L:  Well, I can't either, but it [SIGH] -- it lasted --
R:  It did -- a couple of months.
L:  -- now, I wonder if they -- I wonder if they were talking about Broadway, or, ah, television, or movies.
R:  Oh, exactly, 'cause there are like, professional -- well, they consider professional, or -- you still had the same notoriety --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you perform on Broadway.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I mean, ah, who is it? Ah --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- ah, oh, I like him --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Lane?  The -- the guy, what's his name?  His last name is Lane --
L:  Lane.
R:  -- and then, Vanessa Williams, was, um, just on Broadway, and I -- I -- well, maybe -- I could see them striking --
L:  Why?
R:  -- they don't get half as much money as people in movies.
L:  Oh, oh, oh.
R:  I could seem them striking, they don't -- they don't get, I don't think, of a fraction, I mean, you get the Tony awards, or whatever --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it is like that, but, as far as money I -- and, they're performing live, every night.
L:  I know, I kn- -- that's hard work.
R:  Exactly, you remember --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have to say the same things, you have to remember all of the lines --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- at least, if you're on film, you can cut, edit it out, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- try it again, but, um --
L:  You do it once, and the lighting makes you look good, and, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- all that, yeah, but --
R:  And if there's not the perfect lighting, we'll make it the perfect lighting.
L:  Right, right.
R:  You can't, yeah --
L:  You know, I -- I got a chance at Disneyworld or Epcot -- one of them, they had or -- or maybe it was MGM, [SIGH] they had -- you could be  star, and they asked for volunteers, and of course, my hand went up and I'm jumping up and down, and I got picked, and I got to be --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- a soap opera star, on this, um, ah, thing that they were producing for the audience there --
R:  Get out.
L:  -- and, it was a blast, they have me a boa, they put me [MN] -- fancy dress on me, or like, a long flowing dress, and it was so cool, I was to be seated on a sofa -- there was somebody behind me whispering things to me -- I had a teleprompter, and I had a ball.
R:  Get out -- did you get to slap somebody?
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Did you get to slap somebody, I think that's the --
L:  No, no, I didn't [LAUGH].
R:  -- best part of it [LAUGH].
L:  No, I got to tell this guy off, which --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- I enjoyed [LAUGH], and it was -- it had to do with All my Children, which was a soap that I had watched at the time --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- so, I was having a ball, and I think, with that kind of support it's -- you know, I find it easy for me to do, I mean, I couldn't make a mistake --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and, it was a blast.
R:  I mean, who doesn't have -- what do they call the cue cards?
L:  Right.
R:  The teleprompter --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- every- -- I mean, but like you said, the only people I think that don't have that, and I can't say that, because I'm not too much into Broadway -- don't they still have the cue cards, like, off to the side?
L:  [SIGH] I don't know, but, yeah, I -- I have to agree with you -- it would be harder work on Broadway.
R:  It would be harder work on Broadway, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I still think they have the cue cards off to the side, ah --
L:  They very well may, and we have a neighbor who's an actor, and he was on All my Children for a short period of time, and ah, he does a lot of off Broadway --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, ah, he does little theatre -- he does whatever it takes to make a buck, and it's not easy work, and you don't get rich on it -- you have to hustle.
R:  True, is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that his only job?
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Oh, see, I have a boss and he, um, you -- we're in the municipal government, and he acted -- he acted, like you said at the little playhouses --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and he -- he was in, um, Sixth Sense -- he got like, a little walk on part in Sixth Sense, you see him, like, walking in the background, or something like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and he's done it on quite a few of the, um, Bruce Willis films, that are filmed here in Philadelphia --
L:  Wow, oh that's neat --
R:  Yes, yeah. 
L:  -- oh, you're in Philadelphia, I'm in Pittsburg.
R:  Okay, yeah --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- he's -- he's done a couple of those -- that's the one there -- he's really good, he's produced a play --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- um, yeah, he's really good --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I really like him, and I've gone to see a few of his works, and he -- [MN] I say acting is hard --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but, he's about to retire, and he can devote a lot of his time to it now.
L:  You know, my dream, when I do retire and have the time, is to do something like little theatre [SIGH], I've always wanted to be on a stage, and --
R:  Well, do you think you'll strike too? 
L:  Do I think I'll what?
R:  Strike [LAUGH] -- for better working conditions --
L:  Oh, I don't think so.
R:  -- [several inaudible words].
L:  Believe me, when I get to the point and I'm retired, it won't be for money --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and I'll be doing it because I love it.
R:  Enjoy it, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, 'cause that's something I've wanted to do since I was in high school, to tell you the truth.
R:  I could understand doing it, like, on a small theatre --
L:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
R:  -- I can understand that, I mean, but, you know, they don't have, um, -- they don't have, ah, I -- I don't know, they should still have the hairdressers and cosmetologists --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and -- and things like that, but, [MN] I mean, it's skilled down --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- quite a bit.
L:  Yeah [SIGH], but that one time, heaven [SIGH] -- you know, the person dressed me, having them prompt me for what I had to do, and hair, and -- it was a blast, what a head trip --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I can't imagine striking --
R:  I --
L:  -- I just can't -- but ...
R:  I wouldn't either.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't either.
L:  So, I -- I think it's stupid -- no, ah, for athletes, I was never -- I never really paid much attention to football, or baseball -- we're nascar fans, and they don't tend to strike, and they tend to pay for their own stadiums and that kind of stuff and the --
R:  Exactly, exactly, exactly.
L:  -- yeah, and the other athletes [SIGH] -- I don't know what I think about their salaries [NOISE], um, [NOISE] I don't know, it's a lot of money.
R:  It's exorbitant.
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  And I think that they -- they should pay --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, well --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a lot of them -- I don't know if that's a profession where you get healthcare included, on top of all of this exc- -- but, with that excessive salary you could pay for your own healthcare --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- it's no problem.
L:  Yeah, very true [SIGH] --
R:  You know --
L:  -- I never thought about that either.
R:  You know?  So, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I really don't understand, ah, how would -- ah, well, that would be a question --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- maybe that would be something to strike about, if an actor had to start paying for their own --
L:  The benefits, yeah.
R:  -- benefits, yeah --
L:  Yeah, yeah, and --
R:  -- [inaudible], health, whatever it is --
L:  Yeah, and maybe retirement, and [SIGH] who knows [SIGH].
R:  Oh, yeah, I never thought about the retirement.
L:  Yeah, I didn't either, 'til this minute [LAUGH].
R:  You know, all of this -- all of these things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I really think you have to be an independent and get --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
R:  -- but, you get the money to do that.
L:  Right, you're making enough bucks to --
R:  Let's be sensible --
L:  -- cover your own -- yeah, to cover your own benefits.
R:  Let's let one Bentley go, so we can have health insurance.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
