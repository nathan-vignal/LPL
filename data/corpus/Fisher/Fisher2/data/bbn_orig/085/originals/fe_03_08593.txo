R:  Hi.  Is there somebody there?
L:  Yeah, hi.
R:  Hi.  I'm Perlston[?].  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm Leanne.
R:  Hey, glad to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you, too.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, so our topic is conflict in the Middle East.
R:  Yep.  That can get interesting.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I said that could get interesting.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  All righty.
R:  Okay.
L:  So what are -- what are your thoughts on what is going on?
R:  Ah, I'm wondering if we bit off a bit more than we can chew.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What do you think on the whole thing?
L:  Um, yeah, it seems like Bush has got his hands in a lot of different regions right now and I'm not sure if he is going to be able to maintain his promises, I guess, in every region, but we'll see.  I read an article yesterday in the newspaper that Rumsfeld says we don't have enough, ah, military.
R:  Mhm.
L:  To occupy Iraq, ah, like we should, to officially like get reconstruction underway and everything, so ...
R:  Yeah, that's been a big question.  I mean, conquering it was fairly easy but what do you do now?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I think they are trying but I'm not sure there is a real good answer because sooner is -- ah, his regime has been pretty well controlling everything for so long now I don't know there is anybody else that can do it.
L:  Yeah.  Nobody knows what's -- what's going on or what to do.  I think it would be extremely frightening for the people there just being under such tight control and then all of a sudden being granted this freedom that they've never had before.  It's kind of like what should we do with the freedom now that we have it?  [MN]
R:  Yeah, that's -- that seems to be that they are a little confused about the whole thing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  What to do with it, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would have to agree with that one.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I don't know if -- if peace will ever fully be obtained over there.  I don't know, it's kind of -- of a sticky situation, I guess.  I think you're always going to have the extremists that are --
R:  Unhappy with everything.
L:  -- you know, want Saddam back or don't want the US there or something.
R:  Right, somebody is going to be unhappy no matter what you do.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah.  I mean, it's -- that's the way it works for any country regardless of whether their leader was just over thrown or not.  So, I don't know.
R:  Well, as -- as many people as we have unhappy in this country, I can't expect much different in another form.
L:  Yeah.  Definitely.  Ah, so do you think his -- his plan for reconstruction is going to work or ...
R:  Well, I'm not totally sure what his plan for reconstruction is, that's the problem.
L:  Yeah. I --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  He's pretty -- pretty vague on that actually but, I don't know, I only recently started reading the newspapers again 'cause I got disheartened with the whole situation.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And stopped, stopped depressing myself, and then finally I decided I should start reading the paper again, so ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, did the respite help or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, it was a nice -- a nice break from actually knowing what was going on.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...  [NOISE]
R:  How do you feel now that you're back in the mainstream?  I mean, do you see any hope for it all?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, has there --
L:  Oh, like I said before, again I'm overwhelmed by it because he's gone [NOISE] and got his hand in more -- more countries since the last time I read the paper, and more has happened, and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I don't know if we are going to be able to keep up with everything.
R:  Now they're talking about other countries.  [LAUGH]  That one's a little scary too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Who knows, who knows.  He tries -- tries to be the world police officer.
R:  You know --
L:  And I'm not sure that other countries appreciate it or want us to be, but --
R:  I'm not sure we want to be, you know, that's  [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, the public I'm not sure, but obviously Bush wants to be do gooder extraordinaire, whatever.
R:  Well, in a way I kind of admire him for trying something but I do wonder sometimes about a little bit of, you know, what we are getting into.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I can understand just, you know, the feeling of wanting to try and do something.  No matter whether it is right or wrong, I've got to admire the fact that he's trying.
L:  Yeah.  That's -- that is true.  That is true.
R:  You don't sound totally convinced.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I mean, sure everybody wants to try to do something but [NOISE] I don't know if he is -- [SIGH] if he really knows what he is getting into 'cause I remember when he ran I always was thinking that international politics was not his strong suit and I was concerned that basically if we got in a situation similar to the one that we just are coming out of or in the middle of.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like he probably wouldn't know how to handle it right, but I think he has good advisers in there trying to help him.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he has got some good people but I'm not sure they know what to do either.
L:  That's true.
R:  That's the problem.  I mean, we have Afghanistan already going.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And there is no -- there is no real end in sight for that one that I can see.
L:  Right.  And if he keeps going after terrorism, I mean, [MN] I guess any country that is hiding or harboring terrorists is going to get wiped out.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  According to him, but that I don't think is going to work at all.
R:  Well, I don't think there is enough popular support for him to just wipe out any country he feels like.  I mean, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- especially with the news riding with the troops and all, I mean it really limited how much underhanded things they could do.  It was really ver- -- well controlled I thought.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I was impressed with the military leaders and how well they handled it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, ah, --
L:  I think -- I think Saddam almost invited the media to come in just to outrage the public, I guess, even more by -- 'cause, you know, the media gets in there and then they start video taping like horrible, just whatever happens but they can show on TV and keep people interested in it, whether it be American soldiers hurting Iraqi citizens or whatever, and I don't know, I just think that having the media in there hurt popular support for having the military there.  It was kind of -- kind of tricky if -- if Saddam was really thinking along those lines but I don't know if he was or not, so ...
R:  Well, they were both trying to adapt the media to, you know, what they wanted it to see.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's -- sometimes truth is a very difficult thing to get hold of.
L:  That's true.  Very true.  So, I don't -- mhm, it is a very, very tricky situation over there.
R:  Well, it really is.  And it can blowup at any point too.  I mean, that's  [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh yeah, no doubt.  I mean, we still don't know where Saddam is, do we?
R:  Ah, not that I've heard.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm sure they would tell us if they found him.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sure they would.  He's got so many impersonators and other random stuff too that it's -- I have no idea.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But all for hunting him down and making him pay.
R:  Yeah, well, you know, if, you know, twenty five million dollars or whatever doesn't [LAUGH] -- doesn't help --
L:  A reward?  To find him?
R:  Yeah, they have put out a reward on Saddam and all the sons.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  It's like fifteen -- fifteen million on Saddam and I think ten million for each of his sons.
L:  I didn't realize that.
R:  And it hasn't really seemed to make any difference, so that kind of bothers me a little, too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, if he is hiding he's hiding and nobody can find him, regardless of whether there is a price tag on him or not.
R:  Well, somebody knows where he is.  I mean, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I guess they are just so loyal to him that -- which is kind of hard to believe, but [LAUGH] -- so loyal to him that money does not matter for him.
R:  Mhm.  Or so afraid for their life if they turn him in.  [MN]
L:  Yeah, because I'm sure he's still [LAUGH] -- whether he gets caught or not he still probably has some pretty scary connections.
R:  Uh-huh, I suspect he does.  [LAUGH]
L:  Like the mob kind of.   [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, with that kind of money, it's -- it's easy to buy those kind of connections, too.
L:  Very true.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Very true.  Did they ever find out what happened to the -- the money from the bank that they suspected one of the sons stole or ...
R:  They found part of it, ah, but there's still a chunk of it missing.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, that -- the gap that I didn't read the news.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
