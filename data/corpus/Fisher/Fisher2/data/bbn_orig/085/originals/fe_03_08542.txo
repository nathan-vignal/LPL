L:  [NOISE]
R:  Matt.
L:  Hi, my name is Pam.
R:  Hi, Pam.
L:  Hi.  What's your name?
R:  Matt.
L:  Oh, Matt.  Hi, Matt.
R:  [MN] How ya doin'?
L:  I'm pretty good.
R:  That's good.
L:  What do you think about this airport security thing they're asking us [LAUGH] about today? [NOISE]
R:  Well, I don't do a lot of flying and --
L:  Me, either. [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I haven't flown in a while --
L:  Me, either. [LAUGH]
R:  -- but, um, I know that my few experiences with flying --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the security hasn't been --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- very tight but that was a while ago.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I understand that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they're doing a lot more, uh -- or they have a lot more tactics now like checking people's shoes and --
L:  Stop that.
R:  -- things like that but, uh --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- um, I -- I don't know if, um -- if they're that effective.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, if something like nine eleven can still happen then, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, obviously they're not.
L:  Well, I -- you know, when I think about, um -- [NOISE] hold on one second.  Listen, could you just do me a favor, could you not let him trigger all this crap?  Can you just ignore it? [NOISE] Thank you.  One of things that I'm -- well, when that whole thing with nine eleven happened one thing that really struck me was just how much freedom we really have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and how much freedom [NOISE] -- I mean, I -- I didn't realize how free we were [LAUGH] until nine eleven.  Then it dawned on me, you know, like anybody can fly, you know, all you had to do was have the money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anything you want to do in America, all you have to do is have the money.
R:  Yeah, you know, a lot of -- lot of people can be bought with money I know and -- and, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it -- it's just, uh -- it's just pretty much a shocker for me.  I mean, I -- I -- I didn't really think that, you know, you could board a plane with any kind of weapons like that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and kinda take it over like they --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like they supposedly did but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I guess it's just a surprise when, um -- I -- like I said, I haven't really flown since, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Since those attacks so I don't -- I don't know about -- too much about their new policies but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, I know they haven't really had any trouble since then but I do wonder if --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  If, you know it's possible that something like that could happen again.
L:  Yeah, I -- I would imagine that -- I mean, even with the increased security --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, and with pilots having stun guns and guns and, I mean, [SIGH] when you think about all the things that pilots have to think about, [NOISE] uh, in terms of what their job entails --
R:  Right, just flying the plane alone, I suppose.
L:  -- and when you think -- yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, you know, people's safety, um, appropriate handling of -- of their, uh, navigational tools and -- and all that, when you think about all of that and you think about the flight attendants and what they're supposed to be doing and passengers basically just get on ...  Hey, hey, I need this to work, Philip.  If you're going to be a jerk, Travis, then let's go in the house. [NOISE] Um, I have two boys that --
R:  [LAUGH] I sort of figured.
L:  This -- this sibling rivalry thing is really, really working with me.  Um, can you just ignore what he says and just help him put his skates on and let him skate?  Just ignore him.  He's silly, he's ten years old, come on. [NOISE] Oh, it's summertime.  Um, so I -- you know, I thought about it and I just realized that, I mean, they can increase security.  I think it's more so to increase people's, um, general feeling of comfort --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but essentially anything can still happen.
R:  Yeah, I mean -- yeah, I suppose, you know, if anyone's committed to it, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- they don't care about their own life then --
L:  [NOISE] Oh, shut up, Travis.  Mhm, go ahead.  I'm sorry, Matt.
R:  -- they just -- no, it's all right --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- then you know, I mean, obviously that something like that could still happen but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, you're right, I mean, I suppose most of it's just to increase people's uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, uh, how you put it?  Like, I don't know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- awareness or, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Or, uh, confidence.
L:  And -- and people -- I guess -- right, right and then, too, what seems to also happen is, um, [NOISE] people, um, who are preparing to go flying are, uh, more watchful, they're more attentive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] -- and they're -- they -- they tend to be, uh -- they tend to be more attentive to who's going flying with them. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  And so then they tend to, uh, be, uh, more watchful and they seem to be helping security to sort of, you know, be aware and if they hear anything ... so there's been, you know, the whole piece with, uh, uh, freedom of speech and, uh, what's appropriate and what people should and shouldn't be doing but I guess by the heightened security it also heightens people's awareness.
R:  Yeah, I -- I -- I remember, um --
L:  Can you move back a bit. [NOISE]
R:  -- hearing some news stories about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  About people's experiences with flying after the, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  The attacks and, you know, a lot of people just say it's just silent now --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and everyone's just trying to keep their cool and not --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, look like they could be up to something and --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  And it's just -- it's just a different sort of --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- situation now, I guess.
L:  Mhm, mhm. [NOISE]
R:  But, uh, I mean, I really wish I flew more so I could speak, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with a little more experience about it but --
L:  Well, I mean, just -- when you just think about your own experiences in the past, I don't think flying and all of -- [NOISE] I don't think the general flying experience has really changed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I think that basically what we're looking at is just that [NOISE] people are being more attentive because nobody ever thought -- nobody ever thought that anybody [NOISE] --
R:  Right.
L:  You need to hold on to this if you need to go see him or something, keep that -- put that on your back, okay.  Just if he falls.  I mean, you can watch him or you can sit on the other bench.  I'll see you guys in a bit.  You got your house keys, Phil? [NOISE] Good.  They're staying out here, they're going to roller blade but I --
R:  Oh.
L:  My youngest kid is just -- he's just young, what can I tell you.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know the -- you know the deal but --
R:  You don't have to explain, I -- I think I get your, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I get the point.
L:  It's just -- they don't really -- they -- they love each other but they don't get along too well and I'm trying to --
R:  Well, they're siblings.
L:  Yeah, I'm trying to [MN] show them how to be more collaborative and, again, my, uh -- my, uh, oldest boy is manic depressed so he's on meds and he's getting psychological services and --
R:  Oh, I know that.
L:  -- it's just a tough situation, you know.  But when you think about -- now when I think about before my son was treated, before he was properly diagnosed --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I think about all the people out here who aren't diagnosed, who need help, who can't get it and then you think about a nine eleven type incident, I -- the way I see it is just, you know, you -- if you're -- if you're a Christian and you believe in the Lord and you have some, you know, Christian tendencies, all you can do is pray for the best because, as far as I'm concerned, anything can happen.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't think it matters what kind of security is put in place, I really don't think it matters one way or another, I think it's just, like you say, you know, it gives people a sense of -- of urgency where they know they need to pay attention more --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Everybody's paying more attention but I think the reduced, um -- the re- -- [NOISE] the reduction in people flying has indicated clearly that people don't think that these security measures are any more effective than anything else.
R:  Okay.
L:  You know, people have just, like, stopped flying.
R:  Yeah, you know and it -- I mean, I'm guessing that even when that situation happened, I mean, it's not like security was non existent so, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it seemed like that would have been inevitable anyway, you know, it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, if -- if the whole -- whole, uh, group of passengers couldn't have subdued these terrorists then, I mean, even, you know, now if the pilot had a gun or something like that then, I mean, what -- what could they really do, you know, if --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  You know, if they get some people and hold them hostage and just say, you know, give us your guns or whatever and they'll just hand them over and then they're right back at, you know, point A --
L:  Square one.
R:  -- or wherever they were before.  Yeah.
L:  And then when you -- when you, you know -- as we read all the things that have gone on in the -- in the recent months, these suicide bombers, I mean, these people wrap themselves up in bombs.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What are you going to do? [LAUGH]
R:  I just can't believe devoting yourself --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that, uh -- that much to their cause or whatever they're, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I'm not familiar with their cause or whatever but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  But like, I mean, I know, like, you know, you can be --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Christian and stuff like that and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, really be devout in a religion and, you know, not have to go and blow yourself up as the cost. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that's just ridiculous.
L:  Yeah.  I think there's a certain level -- well, what has happened [NOISE] -- um, what I -- what I've figured out is also that, um [LIPSMACK] you -- it's -- it's not that much different [NOISE] from being involved in gang activity.
R:  Really?
L:  You know, where people indoctrinate you from [NOISE] the time you're really young and so you don't know any other way.
R:  That's a good point.  Yeah, and I suppose a lot of these people are just desperate --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be a part of something and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- yeah, the --
L:  'Cause it -- yeah, they -- they -- they -- they look for people who are compromised, um, emotionally.
R:  Vulnerable, yeah.
L:  Yeah, they -- they seek them out and they look for people who are desperate for money and offer them money and, I mean, bin Laden, for example, has quite a bit of money and, uh, it's -- it's basic that, you know, when you offer someone money just like -- 'cause they found a guy, I --
