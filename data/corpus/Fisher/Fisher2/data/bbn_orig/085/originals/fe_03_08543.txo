L:  Nancy.
R:  Nancy, my name is Martha.  How are you?
L:  Hi, I'm -- is that Martha?
R:  Yes.
L:  Hi, Martha.  I'm fine.
R:  What area are you from?
L:  I'm from Long Island City.
R:  From where?
L:  Long -- in Queen's.
R:  Queen's?
L:  Yeah.
R:  New York?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ah.  I'm in Miami.
L:  [MN] [LAUGH] You're from --
R:  Have you traveled after September eleventh?
L:  Um, my friends have.  I'm too scared to.  I travel by bus.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  By bus 'cause my -- 'cause my -- my sister went to Jamaica the other day and a couple of people have flown to, um -- they have flown to Texas and Arizona and everybody -- everything is fine.  But I still don't feel as safe.  Me, pers- --
R:  I do.
L:  Me -- you -- you've flown?
R:  [NOISE] Yes.  Actually, uh, [NOISE] on two of incidents they -- they took my shoes off --
L:  Really?
R:  -- and put them through the X ray machine and my purse was double checked, probably 'cause I had a cellphone in there.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah, but I -- it's -- it's a little bit more of inconvenience.  I went to the Dominican Republic and they actually searched everything by hand --
L:  Oh.  Yeah, they still do that --
R:  -- and then they have random checkups as well.  That just delays things just a bit more but I feel more secure that they are checking people's luggage and everything else.
L:  Mm.  'Cause it's like everyone is still flying just the same as like I'm -- I'm still scared.  If I have to go to Delaware and I have to go to Jacksonville --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I -- I took the bus, I took the bus.
R:  Well, the bus is not a bad ride.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'll tell you this much.  I like taking -- [NOISE] I've never taken the train but I would love to take the train [NOISE] to your neck of the woods.
L:  Yeah.  I never take -- I've never -- no, I refuse to ride Amtrak, it's a waste of time.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It's just like I want to go to Vegas and it's like I'm scared to go on the plane. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] I don't think so.  It's not -- I don't think it's bad at all.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  [NOISE] I really don't.  I feel that it's -- that it's safe with all the heightened security that they have now whereas before it was -- it wasn't that strict, we -- we were spoiled.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right now it's the way that it should be.  Anyone traveling on that aircraft could do something horrific, and it did happen, and that everyone should be checked, I'm -- I feel that it's right, that they need to take my shoes off and make sure there's no explosives there and they need to check my purse and they need to randomly check, uh, by hand to search.  We had a game of dominoes --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that they actually made us pull it out and -- and check it, as well.
L:  Really?  Hm.
R:  And it doesn't -- it doesn't upset me.  I feel that -- that it's right.
L:  Yeah, it does -- it wouldn't bother me if they had to do it, it's just that the whole airplane itself, I'm just scared of that 'cause they can search me all they want, you know, 'cause, like, even when we go to the clubs and stuff ... actually I feel kinda bad 'cause some clubs I do go to they don't search us, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm like in today's society you're supposed to search everyone and there's still clubs they don't search anyone.  So it's like if they searched me at the airport I wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind, once I don't miss my plane.
R:  The [NOISE] -- well, the scenario is that they're not -- not just searching you [NOISE] they're searching everybody on that flight --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the same way so it just makes it more -- more secure.  I like the idea [NOISE]  that, uh, the pilots are now armed, they have guns [NOISE] and they know how to use 'em, whereas before they were sitting ducks, you know --
L:  That's --
R:  -- they couldn't do anything. [NOISE] And then they have those marshals on -- on board flights now.  They're keeping an eye on everybody that might look suspicious and you don't know if the guy sitting next to is one of those air marshals. [NOISE]
L:  That's true, that's true.
R:  [NOISE] So it's -- the security that we have now is fantastic. [NOISE] Well, if you go to Miami International Airport now and you go to park in the short term parking --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I went to pick up a friend of mine at the airport and what they did was, I drove up, I took my -- my ticket and when I was going to park six officers came --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- hit me in the back of the trunk and said, "Please open the trunk" and they checked my car inside and out and I was happy.  I said if they checked everybody like this there's nothing wrong here, you know.
L:  Mhm.  Whoa.
R:  I wouldn't be scared of traveling.  I'm going to Savannah, Georgia, now, in August --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [NOISE] for a business trip and I -- I -- I'm not worried about it at all, the way that they --
L:  Are you not -- you taking a plane, you're not driving?
R:  No, I'm taking a plane.
L:  Hm, hm, hm.
R:  I just went to the Dominican Republic.  I have no problem with that.  I -- I think that the security that they've done is -- is well, it -- it's working well, it -- it's going to be healthy.  As a matter of fact I think that there should be more --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- in order to make it safer, in order for you to sit on that plane and feel comfortable.  There's one thing that bothers me, though, with, uh, people that look, uh, Arabic, Muslim.  Uh, for some reason you just look at them and maybe they're not part of the terrorist they're -- they're immigrants and they -- they -- their children were born in the United States and everything else but you can't help but look and go, "Well, you're flying with us". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You know what I mean?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's a horrible feeling and I know we shouldn't have it but I feel that they should be doub- -- double checked.
L:  Mm.  'Cause I know we have the --
R:  And I wouldn't like it if because I'm Spanish they're going to check, you know what I mean?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't feel that that's right but what can I tell you, it's that --
L:  'Cause that -- that's ev- -- that's the way everyone feels in general.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Whenever we see them, you know, we're like, "We know you're cool people and stuff like that" and I know a lot of them but you still have to wonder.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, do I piss this person off today and they will just blow the whole school up?  You know, 'cause even like my -- uh, right after nine eleven on my job they was like, "Well, Nancy if you see anything suspicious let us know, come and tell us" and I was like, "Lady, you haven't talked to me like this in two years" [LAUGH].
R:  Right.
L:  "All of a sudden after nine eleven you want me to watch these people" and I'm like, "Duh, come on".
R:  What do you do?
L:  I was working in a library for my school --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and there was like, um -- since, you know, I had contact with everyone she was like, "Well, if you see anything, come up and tell us" and blah, blah, blah and I'm like, "Oh, look" [MN]. [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Too much --
R:  'Cause they could come into the library looking for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- airplane publications and stuff like this so they can get more knowledgeable about something.
L:  It's like -- but it's like so much information on internet anyway, come on.
R:  Right.
L:  But, I'm still -- I'm just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- a chicken. [LAUGH] I'm a big chicken.
R:  I don't think that you should be.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm just a --
R:  That was a -- it happened but it was a fluke.  It will -- that will never happen again.
L:  Me, I'm just a big chick- -- 'cause I love airplanes and I love to take off and all that stuff.  It's just that oh, if I have to go someplace, taking a bus, [LAUGH] I'm taking a bus.  And, in fact, if I have go over water, like to Jamaica or someplace else, argh!  Or if I do go to Vegas 'cause that -- I can't do six days on the bus when I could do six hours on a plane.  Ay, ya, yi. 
R:  Yeah, six hours is a long time.  Oh, I get antsy.
L:  Mm.  But it isn't really --
R:  I went to Argentina once --
L:  Mhm.  Whoa!
R:  -- and, uh, London --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it was, like, eight hours or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like, nine hours and you start getting antsy like you want to get off, "My god, I've been here too long".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So what I do is I take a sleeping pill.
L:  Ah!
R:  "Wake me up when I get there", you know, [LAUGH] that's it --
L:  Uh-uh.
R:  -- I'm gone.
L:  I'll watch -- I'll watch every --
R:  Right.
L:  -- movie they got.
R:  It even minimizes jet lag.  But you don't want to sit there on the plane and suffer, like whatever -- what's going to be it's going be.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  If that's your destiny and that's what's going to happen there's no sense in worrying about it.  The -- the decision is a conscience one, I'm going to get on it and if, you know -- it's up to god and the pilot [LAUGH].
L:  Hm.  'Cause even look at that --
R:  I don't -- I re- --
L:  Even look at that plane that went down and the only person that survived was a little two year old boy.  Now that's a miracle.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's a miracle right there.  Just a little boy, mm.
R:  That happens, you see.
L:  [MN]
R:  It's -- what's meant to be it's meant to be 'cause just maybe you don't get on the plane you can -- there's a problem but, uh, if -- if you were meant to go and god's got your calling you're -- I don't know, you'll have a heart attack the next day.  You know what I mean? [NOISE] What's meant to be is meant to be.  I don't feel like I'm going to worry about if I get on a plane and it's going to happen, it's -- I'm in the safest country in the world.
L:  Hm mm.  Hm, down in Miami, nice.  Used to live in [inaudible] for six years so ... it's nice.
R:  Did you?
L:  Yeah.  It was just too hot, too hot.
R:  Yeah, it is too hot.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Right now, today it's one of those days.
L:  Oh, but --
R:  It's horrible.
L:  [LAUGH] But you got some beach, you got some beach.
R:  It's forty minutes away.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have to drive down and then go through the hassle of finding a parking space or you pay fifteen dollars to park, you know.
L:  Hm.  So, you're gonna take a plane to Georgia.  How long is that trip?  I mean like the flying trip.
R:  Around two hours, I think.
L:  To go to Georgia?
R:  I'm staying through Atlanta. Yeah, it's a two hour flight, I think, an hour and a half, two hours, something like that.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mexico's two and a half hours away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and so is, uh -- so is, uh, Santa Domingo, the Dominican Republic.
L:  Oh.
R:  That was two -- two hours something.
L:  Whoa.
R:  And by the --
