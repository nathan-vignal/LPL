R:  Hi.  I'm Dayla[?].
L:  I'm Tammy. [PAUSE]
R:  So, what do you think about war?
L:  Well, I'm not sure if they're just talking about Iraq or the Middle East in general.
R:  Yeah.  I know. [LAUGH]
L:  So, um, I guess we could go from -- I think they left it broad intentionally.
R:  Yeah.  I just -- I don't know.  I think it's halfway pointless for us to be there.  Just 'cause of the fact that when Saddam Hussein was gonna shoot the missiles --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he couldn't have reached us anyhow.  He could've blown [LAUGH] up every other country but he couldn't have reached us.
L:  Yeah.  But --
R:  So -- 'cause he could only go to a certain point in the ocean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and from that point, the missile still wouldn't have reached.
L:  Hm.  I -- I -- see, I hear what you're saying but I think a lotta times, ah, America puts themselves out there as, kind of, a world protector.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they felt, you know, a- -- h- -- or we felt that there was some sort of major risk that he would be able to, you know, not only, ah, potentially hurt us but hurt t- -- ah, some of our other allies.  So, I don't know if the information was correct 'cause it keeps coming out that w- -- they're not really sure he ever had, ah, nuclear weapons.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I don't -- you know, there must -- there's always reasons we don't hear about 'cause we get the propaganda that they p- -- they put out to the world.  We don't really get the real story.
R:  Yeah.  No.  It's definitely true.  I just -- I don't know.
L:  But also, if we -- we look at the, you know -- the situation in Israel, I mean, then -- then I think that there was also some -- some connection to that too because, you know, the -- the, ah -- the ar- -- the Arab allies all seem to work together and, you know, they -- there's all these -- these terrorist cells are developing all throughout the world and I think there's some -- some, sort of, ah -- idea out there that these, ah -- that they're getting more and more organized and that Saddam Hussein may be a part of the whole structure.
R:  Yes.  I --
L:  And see, that's probably the bigger, you know, challenge is really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- dealing with that.
R:  And never know, like, who he has working for him anywhere.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, that's, kind of, scary. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  But I guess we've also made it really quick and we made a very powerful statement when we went in there and we blew everyone up.  S- -- you know, so the terrorists have been a lot quieter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- since then.  It's because w- -- that mean -- that was a really strong, kind of, signal out there.  Hey, you know, we're -- we're on top of you and now we're b- -- getting much, you know, stronger with our, um, you know -- with our -- the -- i- intelligence going on and apparently we've avoided a lot of terrorist activity.  I'm sure there's something else coming up.  They're not gonna just stay quiet.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'd --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think there's --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- a terrorist --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- threat, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- just if -- like, about a week or two ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- on one of the airports again.
L:  Mm.
R:  They actually caught the guy.  So --
L:  Yeah.  But I mean, if -- you think that they'd be a little smarter about it.  I mean, it's -- to go after the same approach e- -- over and over again, I mean, I d- -- either that they're not that smart or they think that we're just gonna, you know, loosen our -- our -- our, you know -- our -- our security and then just be able to do something like that again.  But it just doesn't make sense.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm glad they're -- they're not that smart because then they may do something else.  I've always thought that, maybe, they'd go after some, like, ocean liner.  You know, 'cause it's harder to protect that.  Or some, sort of, um, you know, like, forum.  You know, some place where there's a lotta people, you know, looking -- listening to a concert.
R:  Yeah.  The -- like, earlier on in the year there was actually a warning out for a ton of apartment buildings that they thought were gonna get hit by terrorists.
L:  Hm.
R:  And I think -- I think it was -- like, in the town I live in and I think they said b- -- ours may have been one of them.
L:  Wow.
R:  I'm, like, "Oh, that's great".
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, my gosh.
R:  [LAUGH] So, we were just, like, "Okay". [LAUGH]
L:  But they --
R:  So --
L:  -- say whenever they hear this intelligence, they have to take everything seriously and sometimes they don't even have all the information.  They hear part of it and they just, kinda, you know, have to -- they have to, you know, go after --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that.
R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  Huh.  But I g- -- I don't know if we can solve all the problems 'cause we don't even have all the information and I don't know if they have all the information.
R:  Yeah.  Ah, that's -- that's the hard part.
L:  Mm.  Yeah. [PAUSE]
R:  [COUGH] [PAUSE] But --
L:  A- are you in -- in Los Angeles?
R:  No.  I'm actually in Reno.
L:  Oh.  Oh, I've been to Reno before.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Interesting. [PAUSE]
R:  Yeah.  The -- the one place that nobody thinks to do anything [LAUGH] with.
L:  Well, you know, it's interesting -- I used to have a boyfriend in Reno and the Reno Airport was -- the security was really tight there.
R:  It's still really --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- tight there.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just -- I dropped a friend off over at the airport --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the other day and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they, like, told me to wait outside --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- until she got all her stuff done.  They wouldn't even let me step inside with her.
L:  Yeah.  So, they --
R:  So --
L:  That is -- it was -- it was, kind of, strange because you were -- I -- this was a couple of years ago and I thought, "Gee, why -- why are they, you know, n- -- a- -- so -- so strict on their security?  It's a little tiny airport.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They must have some reason".
R:  Yeah.  Th- -- I -- they're really strict on all the airports now.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, I mean, my husband and step mom, they were going to, I think, Rhode Island and she got pulled out of line and searched.
L:  Jeeze.  Oh, yeah.
R:  And --
L:  They do those random checks.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I was, like, "Wow". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So --
L:  Well, remember the face of a terrorist can be anybody now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  It's, like, you know, that's -- that's what the danger of this -- these terrorist cells are that, I mean, they're willing to die for any reason at all.  You know --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I mean, they've died -- died for these, you know -- their reasons but the thing is is that, you know, these -- these funda- -- s- -- Muslims, ah, can look Asian because, you know, there -- there's a lot of terrorist cells in -- in -- in -- i- in -- in Asia.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And -- and they're now using women.  So, you know, I e- -- and, um, why it -- why does it have to be a young g- -- you know, guy like we think of them?  It could be an old guy or an old woman.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- mhm.
R:  But I think the real sucker[?] of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- like, when I was watching the news and they had the, um -- I think he was from California, from the area my husband's from --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the American that was over, um, with Bin Laden --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and his group.  I was, like, "Oh, wow".
L:  Oh, yeah.  That one guy?  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- yeah.
R:  And I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  I think my husband even knew him or something.
L:  Hm.
R:  But I'm not [LAUGH] sure.  So --
L:  But, you know, also, in prison, there's a lot of Muslims i- -- like, you know, they're -- they're m- -- they're spreading Muslims in prison.  So, you know, s- -- that -- that -- the Muslim religion.  So, you know, there's a lotta black Muslims and there's all kinds of whoever the prisoners are, are taking on the Muslim religion.  So, you never know, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- what they -- the next one will look like.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well --
L:  It's a scary times we live in.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, is our ten minutes [LAUGH] almost up? [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I ten- -- oh, that's interesting.
R:  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]
L:  So, ah, what else can we talk about in relation to the Middle East?
R:  Um --
L:  Well, oh, it's interesting 'cause I -- I went out with a friend of mine on Friday night and his friend came with us and he's from Israel and we were talking about, um, like, you know, walking around at night here, like, you know, you always -- or even in Reno, I'm sure, you know, there's certain areas you'd be less, you know, s- -- you'd -- you'd be a little more concerned about.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When you walk around in Israel, it's really very safe.
R:  Really?
L:  Um, it just -- it -- we hear all the propaganda, which is true.  Remember when the Watts Riot -- the -- not the Watts Riots, remember the riots, you know, f- -- with Rodney King?  You know, it was at --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Remember, like, it sounded like the whole city was on fire?  You know, like, I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- had relatives call me.  They're, like, "Oh, my god, are you okay?"  I was, like, you know, ten miles away.  I d- -- I -- I watched it on TV like everyone else, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so it's the same thing in Israel.  I mean, sure, there are these, you know, bombs that go off and you know it's not a -- a pleasant experience but --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it's not like it's going on everywhere.  You know?  And sure, you have to be careful but, you know, that's their risk but they have a- -- far -- they have far less rapes, far less criminal activity --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- um, you know, than we do in, like -- in the same size area, you know, if you were to, you know, pick a really bad area or even a good area.
R:  Right.
L:  So, you know, that -- that's where their crime comes from.  And they have a -- they smoke a lot, like in Europe, and they drive, kinda, crazy so they have a lot of car [LAUGH] accidents.  But --
R:  Yes.  I --
L:  So, but it y- --
R:  Yeah.  I think they're one of --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- the other areas that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't have speed limits. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, most of them do but they, you know -- there're just a lot o- -- there's open spaces where people go a little faster and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess people are more in a rush and -- but it w- -- it was interesting because he was t- -- you know, we were talking about how people there take life more seriously.  'Cause, you know, you grow up, you know -- you know you're gonna military service.  You're eighteen years old, seventeen years old carrying a gun, doing, you know, army duty.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whereas, if that's here w- -- you know, we're, like, carefree, you know, kids at seventeen.
R:  Yeah.  That's quite right.
L:  And, you know, we have no responsibility, no nothing, so we take life for granted.  There, you know, life moves a lot quicker.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so, w- -- it was interesting to g- -- kinda, get that feedback.  I had, kind of, forgotten about that.
R:  Yeah.  I'd --
L:  So, it --
R:  I go on the internet a lot in the chat rooms and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it just blows me away how many people from Israel and Iraq and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- Iran that I talk to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and they -- they just, kinda, tell me, like, "Yeah, well this happened and I saw this on the news" and I was, like, "Wow".  You know?  'Cause, like, from my point of view, it seems like it's going on everywhere.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know?  And they're, like, "No.  It's -- it may have happened five blocks down from me" or something.
L:  Yeah.  Well, remember the media has to -- doesn't show, necessarily, the -- the -- the good stuff because that's not interesting. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, occasionally, they'll show some, like, humanitarian effort but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they w- -- they wanna show us all the -- you know, the blood and the guts and the this and the that 'cause that's what they believe brings ratings.  And I guess --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it does.  So, it's -- it's -- you know?
R:  Yeah.  For some reason, our -- our society likes that stuff. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  But I --
