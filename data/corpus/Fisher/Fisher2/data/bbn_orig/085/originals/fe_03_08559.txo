L:  Hello.  My name's Megan McCarthy.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  I'm Gloria Lane.  I live in Georgia.
L:  I'm in, ah, New Orleans, Louisiana.  Ah, what's your opinion on the subject?  Do you think it actually increases our chances of, ah, being safe from terrorism or ...?
R:  It makes me feel better.  It gives me a -- a sense of [LAUGH] -- of they're doing something.  Um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Ho- -- 
L:  Yeah.  That's true.
R:  However, I think that if I were on a plane --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- considering what happened on nine eleven --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a terrorist was to stand up, I think I could take him alone. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Th- --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That was something of my attitude too.  I was, like, I would've been on the one that went down [LAUGH] over Pittsburgh. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, no.  But I mean, I think my problem with it is though is that, um -- I think it is largely -- just makes people feel better.  I question how effective it actually is.  I question what's really being done because no one seems to really want to let us know much about that.  And I understand that it's a sec- security issue to give out too much information but, um, as a fa- -- I think -- I think it's more show than actual efficacy.  That's the way it appears to me.
R:  I think possibly that is true, that it is more show.  Um, but even that -- I mean, I fairly -- you know, I would rather have that than nothing.
L:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  But you know, I mean, it's just -- it's, kind of, ridiculous 'cause I mean, I used to -- I, until recently, lived in Los Angeles and LAX was one of the main --
R:  I lived in Los Angeles too so I know --
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] really?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, you -- then you know LAX and you know what a headache it is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to normally deal with and I was coming through LAX from Costa Rica and they were -- they were, um, you know, not harassing but certainly giving people the runaround who were coming in from Costa Rica.  Th- these people were, you know -- they were bringing in bags of coffee and things like that and, you know, they're having 'em take off shoes and all of this kind of thing.  And I'm just, like, "You know what?  This is a little bit ridiculous".  You know, these are -- these are just Costa Ricans -- relatively poor Costa Ricans who've saved for a long time --
R:  Well, do you think twice before you fly now?  Whereas we didn't used to do that.
L:  Mhm. [PAUSE] See, whereas, I always did but I was always a fearful flyer.
R:  Oh, were you?
L:  So, you know?  Yeah.  But, you know, um, I think m- -- I guess my attitude is that i- if they're determined enough, if they really wanna find a way around it, they're going to, just as they did before.  You know?  We had fail safe measures in place then as well and, you know, even with FBI agents going, "Okay, well, there's a bunch of Middle Eastern guys who, you know, seem to want to learn how to fly planes but don't really care very much about landing" that still managed to es- -- to escape, you know, our dragnet.  So, I think if they're really determined and they really hate us that much, they're gonna find a way.  We need to look at, perhaps, our policies and what not and not just at airport security.  And, um --
R:  Well, have you -- have you noticed, within yourself, being honest now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if I see a Middle Eastern person, I notice that -- that preconceived within me of -- of -- of their being a possible terrorist does come up.
L:  I -- I don't notice that in myself.  Maybe, again, it's because of living in Los Angeles and working in the service industry where you deal with a lot of Middle Easterners --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I had not a lot but several Middle Eastern friends so I think that, kinda, puts a different face on it whereas there's such a tendency with Middle Eastern culture for them, even when they immigrate over to the States, to stay amongst their own community, that n- -- white people or people of other races -- not just white people, but people of other races, feel uncomfortable, um, approaching them as anything other than a threat.  You know, that's how we perceive it.  That's what we see on television, journalists, et cetera, et cetera.
R:  Well, I never did have that before though.
L:  Oh, no.  I understand that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm just saying that since nine eleven, th- that's the face that's been put on the race for us.
R:  Yes.
L:  Because it was such a traumatic event.  You know, and we saw all these faces, "Oh, that this man did it and this man's wanted and we're looking for this person".  That -- that was the face that was unfairly put on them and I think we all know -- I think most of us are rational enough to realize that, you know, the vast majority of people of Middle Eastern descent th- -- you know, they -- they're good people, you know?  But there's crackpots among every group.  You know?  And I just -- I think that, as I say, um, we have to look more at trying to understand each other as different races, as different cultures than as simply, you know, trying to keep somebody from a knife in their shoe  [LAUGH] getting on a plane.  You wanna do that too, undoubtedly.  You know, you do wanna have --
R:  Well, do you have any idea of how we could -- how we could better fix the, ah, security issue, ah, and fl- -- planes [PAUSE] than --
L:  Well, there's --
R:  -- what they're doing now?
L:  There's several different ways.  I have a friend, actually, that I remember very vividly on the morning of September eleventh -- I got a call from my brother and all I heard on my m- -- answering machine -- because I was asleep 'cause of course it was very early in LA -- all I heard on my answering machine was Carrie's name, plane and the World Trade Center.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I turned on the television and I thought I had just seen my friend get burned alive.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  Um, because she was -- she flew that flight routinely and she happened to switch shifts with a fellow flight attendant that day and was not on the plane and was at home asleep.
R:  Well, I had a friend that lived --
L:  But --
R:  -- right across from the Trade Center.
L:  Mhm.  You see, it hit home for all of us.  'Cause I mean --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- just by six degrees of separation --
R:  And we don't know whether --
L:  -- there was inevitably there --
R:  -- he had even been involved.
L:  Of course.
R:  And, um --
L:  Of course.  But, um --
R:  He had his office, ah, and his home in the same building.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it wa- -- and he was so traumatized by that.
L:  Oh, I'm sure.
R:  He moved from New York -- moved his practice and everything to, ah, San Diego.
L:  I'm not surprised.  I -- I -- I couldn't say that I wouldn't do the same myself.  But, um, as I was saying about my, um -- my flight attendant friend, she, um, as I say, flew out of the Boston Airport regularly and she said it was just ridiculous how easy it was just to waltz in and out of security there at that time in the morning.  Um, you know, and she was saying that she was not shocked at all that they had chosen to fly out of Boston because she had no doubts in her mind that of the major city airports that were, you know, within a reasonable striking distance of New York that Boston was pr- probably by far the worst because security was just completely lackadaisical.  There were a lot of commuter, um -- regular commuter, ah, flyers and they just wave 'em through, wouldn't check them.  You know?  Nothing.  So, I think a lot of it is just a matter of getting those people, you know, to where they're not earning seven dollars an hour --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and people are making fun of them --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, you know, calling them lazy and stupid and making jokes, practically, to their faces.  You know, so that they're -- they're -- I mean, [LAUGH] they might as well be postal workers [LAUGH] for the level of disgruntlement --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that, you know, I'm sure they must experience.  And I think it's a matter of, you know, giving them some respect and I'm sure that's gone up a lot since September eleventh two thousand and two -- two thousand and one, sorry.  But, um, I think -- as I say, I think that is a major key is people realizing that this isn't just some rent a cop with no power.  This is somebody who's actually there to keep you safe.  They're doing their job and they're being paid well for their expertise.  And if they're going to get paid for their expertise, they better, by god, have their expertise. [LAUGH]  Is --
R:  I have noticed that since then, whenever I fly, I fly with the least --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than I have ever flown before. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just don't pack the suitcase full as --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as I once did with all the things --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I think I might need.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  So, um -- because I realize that, um, their job is difficult and -- and --
L:  Oh, undoubtedly.
R:  -- maybe it'll make it a little bit easier for them and at the same time, make it easier on myself.
L:  Absolutely.  And -- and I'm sure that there's -- there's probably been a -- a big increase in that, in people just trying to be a little bit more caring and trying to understand these people have a difficult job and that, you know -- that they're -- they're, kind of, the last gateway --
R:  Well, do you think --
L:  -- for state of, ah -- protection.
R:  -- raising the salaries of those workers and maybe, ah, even scrutinizing the, ah, potential employees might be --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- able to, ah -- ah, cut down -- ah, at le- -- at least make the public even feel, um, more secure too?
L:  Mhm.  I think that would help.  And, as I say, um, m- making them -- definitely raise their pay just because they deserve it already because it -- it is a thankless job.  But, um, raise it commensurate with experience, raise it commensurate with further training.  You know, if you voluntarily go in for further training as far as, you know, becoming more of an expert on security issues and what not, then you therefore get a raise or you have the opportunity to advance with the company.  You know?  I think there should be federal safeguards in place that require a certain minimum level of training.  You must have this knowledge or have this license, which, you know, requires a certain amount of knowledge, in order to have this job.  I think that would go a long ways towards making it more effective.  You know?  Because, um, I think a lot of it is just w- -- just slow moving bureaucracy --
R:  Well, hav- --
L:  -- to a certain extent.
R:  Having a uniformed, um, what -- troops in the airport, does that give you any kind of satisfaction?
L:  Not at all.  But, um, I do realize that I would be in the distinct minority with that.  Um, I was raised in a family that is extremely, ah, let's say skeptical, of what the government [LAUGH] really does and, ah, does not just automatically attribu- --
