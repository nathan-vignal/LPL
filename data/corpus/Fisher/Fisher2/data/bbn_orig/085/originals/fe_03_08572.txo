L:  Hello.
R:  Hello, hi.
L:  Hey, I'm Barry.
R:  Hi Barry.  My name's Brenda.
L:  Hi Brenda, how are you tonight?
R:  Hi, oh, pretty good, a little tired, but okay.
L:  Me too.  Where are you?
R:  [LAUGH] Ah, I'm in Minnesota.
L:  Ah, I'm in Atlanta, so it's at least -- you- you're only at ten o'clock, I'm at eleven but I'm tired too.
R:  Oh, yeah, you're an hour later.
L:  I am, I am.  So what do you believe about airport security?  I think it's a bunch of baloney myself.
R:  Ah, yeah, I don't know how much -- much good it is.  It seems to be more of a hassle than good.
L:  I agree with you.
R:  If it -- if it really did improve the situation, yeah, I'd say that that's great, okay, but it just seems like it's hassling people and making it longer waits and --
L:  And I think people who are dedicated to the proposition of insanity and destruction and terror are not going to be stopped by TSA people with little xray machines and -- it was interesting, two nights ago I had -- the first call I had on this stuff was just a couple of days ago and that was Thursday and the topic of the day was has the effect of nine eleven -- what has the effect of nine eleven been on your personal life?  And the guy I was talking to we -- we sort of got to the same subject, you know, about did security really matter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And the guy I was talking to shared with me, he told me he was a pilot.  He -- and he said that as part of a project he did as a -- as a student pilot, he actually attempted and successfully completed the passage through security of a gun.
R:  Wow.
L:  It was a, ah -- it was a pistol, everything but bullets in it.  So it was --
R:  Not the --
L:  -- and he had it wrapped around his knee in an ace bandage and it came up as a metal detector but when they -- see, and they screened him and they saw the ace bandage, they never had him unwrap the ace to see what was under the ace.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he just -- he said he told the -- the -- the security guy that it was just metal hardware under the ace and they said, "Okay", and they let him through.
R:  Oh, my go- -- was that part of the test to actually do that or he just did that to see if it worked?
L:  No, that was part of the test.  That was his -- I mean, that was the assignment that the students in his --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- in his class were given to try to, I mean, evidently they had proper security from people above the -- the screeners --
R:  Ahah.
L:  So that if they did get busted they obviously would not have been arrested and jailed but --
R:  Huh.  They had to come up with their own ideas too.
L:  And they had to come up with their own idea and that was his idea.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And he, you know, made it through to the gate.  I think he told me he was in Cleveland, the airport in -- municipal airport in Cleveland.
R:  Oh, my goodness, they --
L:  And I ha- -- I certainly have no reason to think he wasn't telling me the truth.  I mean, you know, it sounds like a true story to me.
R:  Jeez.
L:  And so and that doesn't surprise me again.  I believe, I mean, you know, it's like people that decide they want to kill the president.  I mean, I think, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah, if they really wanted to they could.
L:  They'd do it and I -- and I think the same thing with terrorists.
R:  Jeez.  That's amazing to hear that story 'cause I was thinking that -- that if people really wanted to still get away with stuff, they just come up with different materials that couldn't be detected.
L:  Right, and I've thought that too.  Did you ever see that movie with, ah, John Malkovich where he played -- and Clint Eastwood where he did assassinate the president?
R:  Yeah.
L:  With the plot and he had a gun made out of non metal.
R:  Mhm, right.
L:  But this guy said it was a metal pistol.
R:  It was a real gun.
L:  A standard, real run of the mill gun but he, you know, wrapped it under an ace on his knee and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- they never had him unwrap the ace.
R:  The same material.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Isn't that something?
L:  It's -- yeah, it didn't surprise me because, again, you know, I'm a firm believer that if -- if somebody is committed to the insanity that these terrorists have showed us that they're, you know, that they're committed to, that they're going to do something.
R:  Oh, yeah, they'll go -- they'll go a way -- they'll do it anyhow, especially if they're the ones that are the suicide people.
L:  Right, right.
R:  They -- they don't care if they live or die.
L:  Right.
R:  Although, jeez, they'll do anything.
L:  Again, nine eleven sure proved that and all these suicide bombers in the Middle East prove that and, ah, I mean, you know --
R:  Mm, that -- that is something.
L:  It's a psyche that I don't understand.
R:  Oh, psyche?
L:  A psyche, you know, a -- a mental -- a mental thought process, a set of thought processes.
R:  Oh, of the -- the suicide bombers?
L:  Yeah, I mean --
R:  The suicide people?
L:  Right, I mean, you know, right.
R:  They're just really dedicated, they really --
L:  Yeah, to, I mean --
R:  It's -- it's like, well, it's like faith or religion what they -- they -- they have it so strong it's like they're almost like, ah, brainwashed or something.
L:  Right, and -- and I think it is.  I mean, you know, and you're right, I think, you know, what I've read -- what I read is that, you know, they believe that by doing this they -- they leave this earth and go to some sort of eternal paradise.
R:  Mhm, yeah.
L:  And I guess, you know, if -- if your thought processes and -- and your beliefs are that that that exists, I guess it's not so frightening.
R:  Yeah, it's sad though 'cause to think they don't have anything worthwhile in this world to enjoy.
L:  Right.
R:  That they --
L:  That is sad --
R:  That they want to leave.
L:  And I think that -- that -- I think that's the substrate upon which, you know, that -- that stuff can get built, you know, that misery of the -- of the world as we know it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [NOISE] And that is sad.
R:  Yeah.  That is really sad.  I am amazed that I just kept thinking the whole time I was waiting for a -- caller to join me, it was like, "Oh, yeah, okay, you know, they're going to get away with it any which way they can and the only thing I could think of then was well, they're going to change the materials".
L:  Right.
R:  You know, but I think, jeez, he got away with it, the ace bandage and like.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Isn't that amazing, scary?
R:  Gosh.
L:  It's scary, you know, but, you know, yeah, it doesn't surprise me.  It didn't surprise me, you know, that's always -- that's always been my beliefs that that's -- that's going to happen.  I mean, I've also been amazed that, you know, just to get off the subject of airport security, but, you know, the terrorists haven't done things like, you know, crash -- crash a suicide kind of plane like they did at, you know, in -- in nine eleven into a stadium or into, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a -- a gathering of a -- of a bunch of Americans at a traditional American thing like a football game or a baseball game.
R:  Right, they don't --
L:  And I go to base ga- -- I live here in Atlanta, I go to base games all the time so that doesn't [LAUGH] stop me from doing that either but, you know, I've been surprised over the, you know, fourth of July I was -- I actually went to the first game on the third of July but, you know.  I mean, I think if these people really wanted to -- to continue their war of terror and then, you know, this friend of mine said well, maybe, "We're, you know, doing such a great job Tom Ridge and the -- and, you know, the Homeland Security" but I have trouble believing that too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, I just sort of think that maybe they're taking a break for a while.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  For whatever reason.
R:  [LAUGH] oh, they've done enough killing. [SIGH]
L:  Oh, they have.  I mean, it is, it's sad, all these innocent people.  A cousin of mine got killed on nine eleven.
R:  Oh, sorry to hear that.
L:  It was his second day -- thank you.  It was his second day of work, ah, on the -- the hundred and third floor, second day.  He had gone to work his first day on that Monday at nine ten and --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  On nine -- Tuesday nine eleven he went to work for his second day.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, you know, his wife was five months pregnant at the time.  It was one of those, you know, one of those stories -- one of the -- one of the thousands of -- of sad, sad stories.
R:  And then that's a shame that they don't care, you know, okay, they don't care about their own life, if they want to come and do this suicide stuff or families --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and children, unborn children.
L:  Completely and completely innocent.
R:  Young children.
L:  But again, and I, you know, the -- the insanity is what I think is insanity is they get -- they get these beliefs that just because we're Americans we're all guilty of this persecution and, you know, responsibility for their state.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is I think a bunch of crap.
R:  Yeah.  It would be nice to find out exactly what it is that's causing this and nip that in the bud.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Instead of coming up with, ah, going into deficit for arms and weapons and things.
L:  Right.
R:  And nuclear stuff.  Find out why -- why the behaviour and then stop it.
L:  Right.
R:  Find a way to -- to create peace that way by, okay, this is enough.  I mean, they do it here.  They -- they, um, they -- they ban a lot, they put this family channels up and then they tell your children, you know, to be careful what they watch, censor what they watch.
L:  Right.
R:  And stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  Why can't we make a -- a pact or agreement with other countries, say, "You want our help, well, you've got to do this, that and the other." [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  I think, you know, that's part of the problem is there's no leadership to -- to cha- -- you know, to -- to direct the impetus to change.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is -- is sad.  I mean --
R:  It is.
L:  -- again all this stuff that -- that happened before we invaded Iraq, it's a, you know, another example of that.  It's -- I think it's just, "Do this" or, "Do this" or "Do this" and they don't want to do this.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And then, you know, Bush thinks that we have the obligation to do what we did.  That's a whole other topic that we're probably not supposed to go to tonight.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  How long have you been doing this thing?
R:  Oh, this is my second call.
L:  Yeah, this is my second call too.
R:  I think I get -- get one more so it'd be nice to keep doing this, it's kind of neat.
L:  It is, it's fun.
R:  Different topics and talking.
L:  Yeah, it is, it's fun.  I like -- I mean, some of my friends just laughed and said, "You mean, you're getting paid to talk on the telephone?" I said "Yes, isn't that pretty funny?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] you must like to talk I take it?
L:  I do, I'm one of those.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When that -- when that commercial was around, "I'm falling and I can't get up", ah, some of my friends used to say, "Barry's commercial is, I'm talking and I can't shut up".
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, yeah.
R:  That's cute.
L:  I have a reputation for -- for chatting.
R:  Oh.  See, it would be nice if you could make a living doing this.
L:  I would, I would.  I mean, these couple of ten dollar calls aren't going to pay the rent though.
R:  True, it'll help.
L:  But it is fun, to me it's like clipping a coup-
