L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Annie from Pasadena.
L:  Uh, my name's Jason, I'm in San Francisco.  You're in California also?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  Mm.
L:  Uh, how did, uh -- do you think, uh, airport security lessens the chances of terrorism?
R:  No, I don't think so.  Those who are determined to do what they're going to do, they're going to do it. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH]
R:  I think it's, uh, high end of paranoia. [LAUGH] That's my personal opinion.
L:  Huh.
R:  I think they -- the, uh -- the terrorists has won have terms of, um, [LIPSMACK] um, fear -- instilling, uh, the fear factor.  I think the fear of something happening is -- is going to kill more people than the actual act. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  You know what, I, uh -- I -- I -- I hear what you're saying but, uh, [SIGH] uh, I -- I think that the security can't hurt --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, even if it's a -- a pain, you know, having to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- remove your shoes and -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, you know, all the extra time and effort and energy.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know they might be a hassle but, uh, if you're going to get on a plane, uh, I -- uh, I'd feel, you know, more comfortable, uh, knowing that -- that they took some measures to -- to ensure my safety and that, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, there -- there's less risk of -- of there being a terrorist attack, you know.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, uh, it's --
R:  Then -- then my concern would go to, okay [NOISE] in terms of, um, the -- the employees that's behind the scene, if that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- scrutiny is the same in terms of the people who put the things on the airplanes, [NOISE] uh, the people who, [NOISE] you know, service the airplanes, [NOISE] things like that.  Is it -- is it a high scrutiny in that -- that arena also? [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Yeah, I -- I don't know what -- what you can do and if -- if someone's determined to --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  To bring a plane down it might be hard to stop them but, uh, there's that -- you know, that other story not too long after the -- the September eleventh incident where --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, someone tried to sneak on the plane with a bomb in their shoe --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  -- and it was like they were -- you know they -- they had fuses, uh, coming out of the -- their -- the soles of their shoe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were trying to, uh -- to light them, you know, and a -- a bunch of people on the plane tackled the person.  I -- I forget his name, I'm certain it was a he but, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, something that like, I mean, it -- it [LAUGH] -- it -- it -- you know, that -- that would, uh -- I'd -- I'd -- I'd feel better if I, you know -- you know, if there was -- there was something to comfort me that that might not happen, you know.  Um, you know, because, I, you know any -- everybody on the plane probably would have, you know, died --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and the plane would have crashed --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it would have been awful.
R:  Yes, but, uh, I -- I think [NOISE] you have mentally deranged folks like that but a, um -- a terror -- terrorist that has been trained very well [LIPSMACK] the -- the things that they're looking for, terrorism went to another stage [LAUGH]. You know, they, uh, um -- what would -- what they would be looking for is not what I believe a terrorist, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- would do, you know, not really giving them any, uh, credit for creativity, you know, in terms of they're looking at X and they +already -- [LAUGH] they -- they already into doing something in -- in -- in the Y arena.  But at the same token now if they're not scrutinizing, uh, the personnel that's putting the things on the plane, the same thing could happen --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- but in terms of technology today they have the technology for the people just to walk through, they don't have to take off their shoes.  So they can see everything, they have the machinery, they can sense everything, so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in terms of the inconvenience and the pat- -- you know, uh --
L:  Um, are -- are you saying that, I mean, you, you know, if it would save the time and the money that you just throw away the metal detectors and everything else and --
R:  Oh no, that's not -- that's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying they have the technology where you don't have to take off your shoes.
L:  Mm.
R:  The technology is there, [NOISE] you know what I'm saying.  The technology is there.
L:  [MN]
R:  Now if you really think a terrorist -- you -- you -- you may find mental folks trying to -- to -- to do that but they have the machinery where you can just walk through, they can sense everything.
L:  Mm.
R:  They can see everything, they have the sensors to sense whether you have some type of explosive and the whole ten yards.  So use the technology, you know what I'm saying [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because taking off your shoes and this and sh- -- that -- that puts you in -- in -- in such a high st- -- uh, state of anxiety going through all these changes, you know.
L:  Well, is, uh, uh -- the question, though -- the --the question asked us if it was about security, right?  I mean, I -- I don't know if that means, uh, technology or security people or both or either but I -- I think that's what the question was, was, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, it was about airport security, right, and I -- I mean, uh, I -- I hear you about the technology, if -- if you can just walk through a -- a machine and that makes sure everything's safe then, I mean, I -- I -- I think everybody'd be happier that way --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, but, um, it -- it's -- it's kind of a burden and a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, an inconvenience, uh, if you have to go through all these security measures of being frisked and --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- taking your shoes off and having people go over you with the -- the metal sensor and everything else but, uh, you know, I -- it -- it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But on the other side of the coin you don't want the -- the, uh -- the plane to crash.
R:  Uh --
L:  You know what I mean.
R:  And -- and -- and I hear you -- [NOISE]
L:  Huh.
R:  -- but I don't think that is the only solution is just to frisk the passengers, you know.
L:  Huh.
R:  There -- there is personnel that put things on the planes, you know.  You -- you may have a -- a crazy stewardess, how can you stop that, you know?  So it -- it's -- it's -- it's just more than one prong approach [NOISE] uh, just saying that the terrorists would come through like, um [LIPSMACK] -- come through as a passenger.  If we just focusing on just the passenger, you know [NOISE] [SIGH] then the -- the -- the terrorists can shift to the pilot, can shift to the -- the other personnel that puts things on the plane.  So, you know, if you really want to be secure there's other portions that you need to be equally as concerned about. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, I mean, I -- if I got on an airplane, I mean, I -- I don't fly so often but I -- I might feel better if there was a guard or two up near the cabin, you know what I mean, 'cause that's what happened with the -- the September eleventh thing, they -- they just stormed into the cabin with some kind of ceramic knives, or that's what they think happened, you know, and then there was the one plane that -- that crashed in -- was that in Pennsylvania where it crashed?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That, you know, there was -- the people were -- they were heroes, you know, they --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  They, you know --
R:  Yeah, so --
L:  -- rushed up and -- and tackled the [SIGH] -- the -- the terrorists that were going for the cabin and, you know, averted them from -- from reaching their -- their target, you know, whatever that was.  And if I remember right that's where -- where that plane crashed was in Pennsylvania, uh --
R:  Yes but they -- they have now the people that ride the airplane.
L:  Mm.
R:  Also if they put the money into securing the doors then that would alleviate, you know, having to have someone, you know, stand there by the door --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- although they have -- they have hired the sky -- sky marshals.  If they put the money into securing the doors then that would be secure 'cause, you know --
L:  I mean, I -- I might feel better if they had security people, you know, uh -- you know, and that was just their job on the airplane.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know, maybe one up near the cabin and one near the -- the -- the -- the back of the plane and, uh --
R:  I, uh -- well, I -- I -- I hear you but to be that -- uh, that again sets up a-- really a false sense of security --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because those who are going to do what they need to do or feel, you know, all this crazy stuff because there's evil in the world --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that, um, they have other ways.  I think -- I don't think [LAUGH] they really focus in on taking down planes that way anymore but the terrorists have won in terms of setting up the fear factor now in terms of the security, if they're going to secure it, secure it across the board.  Don't give me a sense of, uh, um, false security where you -- you frisk me and did all of these things but then --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you have personnel that can do whatever they need to do.  So to me that's a false sense of security.  If you're going to do it, do it across the board, don't just frisk me, do all of these things --
L:  You, uh --
R:  -- then you have on the other side that people can go behind the scenes, do what they -- you know, do crazy stuff and the whole ten yards. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah, well, I mean, what I'm about to say is if you're going to pay so much money for a ticket, I mean, it -- it might be that you'd rather have a -- you know, a -- a better quality meal, you know, than the security on the airplane, you know, and -- and that -- that might just be a
