L:  Alex.
R:  Hi, I'm Emma.
L:  Hi, Emma.
R:  Uh, you said your name was Alex?
L:  Alex, yes.
R:  Oh, okay.  Uh, do we start talking now, I guess, I don't know?
L:  I guess.
R:  Uh --
L:  So, what do you think about airport security?
R:  Well, I think it's good that they have heightened airport security.  Um, it may be a pain but, yeah, I definitely think it's going to lessen chance of terrorism and stuff because, [SIGH] you know, I mean, you know, if they just don't pay attention to what's going on, you know, then, pshaw, anybody can just walk on and do whatever they want, you know what I mean?
L:  When was the last time you traveled?
R:  Oh gosh, I haven't traveled since, actually, ninety eight.
L:  You see, that's why you're saying it's good because actually if you traveled lately, you know, you're going -- you're going to see it's just a joke.
R:  Oh, what's been going on lately?
L:  Well, the funny thing is, you know, how we always do, you know.  We [inaudible] react [inaudible] and like we have to wait, uh, [inaudible] then we react, you know, upon it, you know.  The thing is, you know, I feel really sorry for the people who, you know, lost their lives on nine eleven but, you know, I -- I think the thing would have been, you know, stopped if somebody at the airports were, you know -- was doing his job as we're supposed to do.  But, anyway, you know, because I travel so often, you know, I can tell you that certain airports, you know, they'll, like, really strict, okay, and some airports are just like, you know, to pretend like they were strict, you know, like --
R:  Pretend like they're strict?  How do they pretend?  I don't know.
L:  Okay, like, you know, for example, you know, all the ladies they pass by, you know, with their handbags, you know, the [inaudible] --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Unchecked, you know, unchecked, you know.  And these people are not stupid, you know, like, you know, like if they used guys this ti- -- you know, the last times, they won't use the same as -- as other time, you know.  Maybe they [inaudible] to use women, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because [inaudible] really there a lot of people out there willing to do anything for money, you know --
R:  Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah.
L:  -- especially people from eastern Europe, you know.  They don't care about themselves that much, they care about their families and their kids and whatever.  You know, if somebody tells them, you know, "I'll give you a million dollar and you do this", they will do it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, that's definite.
L:  Anyway, you know, I'm telling you, you see an older guy, you know, he got, like, you know, some metal pieces in his knees and he goes through the metal detector, you know, and it's activated.  You know, he's a senior citizen.  What are you expecting from a senior citizen to do?
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  You know, who even -- he hardly walk but because he got, like, nails or something in his knees, you know, they have to search him or something like that, you know.
R:  Oh, I know, I hate when they do that stuff.
L:  While all these bags, you know, off ladies, they just passing by and nobody even bother about it.
R:  Oh, that's ridiculous.
L:  You know, I'm -- one -- one instant, I have seen it in, uh, Florida actually, in Fort Myer Airport in Florida, you know, a lady pass the security and then she came back, she said, "You know what, I have a scissor in my bag" and they didn't even, you know -- didn't even see it, you know.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, but actually here in New York, I've be -- I'm calling from New York, you know -- so here in New York, actually, it's really tough.
R:  Oh, well, yeah.
L:  It's really, really tough.
R:  Well, that's one where nine eleven happened, you know.
L:  Okay, but then --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah, but then, you know, what happened is they decided that, you know, because there so many attention in New York and Washington DC, they're going to try somewhere else where there's no attention.
R:  Uh [LIPSMACK], I know.
L:  You know.
R:  I know, they're too busy --
L:  And actually, like --
R:  Target the wrong people.
L:  Yeah, yeah, you know.  And the [inaudible] is you know, everybody has to, like, you know, sacrifice a little bit but, you know, at least -- you know, and the funny thing is they were, like, making a big noise here because they don't want, you know -- they want, like, high school graduates to be, like, you know, sec- -- airport security, you know.  That's at least the minimum and people were upset about it, you know, they said, "What high school has no secure?".  Like, excuse me, you know, you're trusting these people for some other people's lives, you know and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- they should at least, you know, be able to, like -- you know, to pass high school or something.  You know what, our schools are about to be entrusted your life, you know.
R:  Yeah, I know, that's true, you know.  At lot of these people, too, they're not paid that much so they're like, "Oh, I don't care", you know, they're -- they got this attitude but they -- it shouldn't be that way because, like you said, it is people's lives unfortunately so [SIGH] it's hard, it's a hard thing but they --
L:  Yeah but you know what if they -- they all -- they keep concentrating on the passengers, you know, but there are some other areas they have to be concentrating on, you know, like the people who had access to the airport, you know, so people who work there --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, the people who do catering on the aeroplanes, the people who do, you know, housekeeping on the aeroplane --
R:  Yeah, right.
L:  -- 'cause they can just implant something on the aeroplane, you know.  But now it's just becoming a big joke, like every time you have to fly international you have to be there, like, three or four hours earlier --
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  -- and domestic -- yeah, and domestic you have to be there, like, two hours earlier, you know, and two hours means two hours, you know.  If you're like hour or forty five minutes, they won't let you go in.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  Yeah, and then the funny thing is all the luggages now have to be man -- hand searched.  Okay, so, you know, you don't need -- if you travel anytime soon you don't need to spend your time fixing your bag or whatever, just dump everything inside and just close it, if you can, because no -- no matter how you're going to, you know, arrange everything neat and nice, you know, it's not going to stay the same for long.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Once they reach the airport, they're going to open it, you know, and search through the whole thing, you know.
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  Yeah, I guess, you know -- but, you know what, it's just some kind of price we should be willing to pay, you know, in return for our, you know, feeling safe and secure and something like that, you know.  A lot of people would like try -- you know, try to avoid flying after September eleven happened because everybody was like, you know, scared and, you know, everybody suffer.  Airline people have lost many of their jobs and, you know, airline start, like, cutting down the prices, they're cutting down the operation hours and everything.  It was, you know [MN] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- just that factor, everything started going down, you know.
R:  A lot of people, uh, you know -- well, they went, uh -- they went into bankruptcy, a lot of them, you know. [SIGH] It's sad, it really is sad but, um, [LIPSMACK] I know, it -- it's like, uh, [MN] I'm kinda leery of flying too [inaudible] because I don't know -- I don't know -- uh, I haven't flown for years so I don't really know how it's going to be when I do fly, you know, I just --
L:  Well, I hope it gets better any time, you know, because right now, you know -- and that's like an added ex- -- cost also, you know, because now every time you buy an air ticket, you know, there is like five dollars, ten dollars, they call it nine eleven security, you know.
R:  Oh yeah, 'cause they -- yeah, they gotta pay the extra security. [SIGH] Oh, my gosh, yeah, even though they had that --
L:  Yeah, but you see -- you see the thing is with people, you know, like after every disaster happen everybody's like, you know, "Okay, we're willing to do this, we're willing to do that" but after a while they see everything like, you know, clear and, you know, everything's calmed down and they're like, "Why I have to pay extra?" you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then it's got -- it's going to end up, like, the -- the feeling at the moment is going to be no one paying for it.
R:  [MN] Yeah, I know.
L:  Like, you know, you see all these, you know, screener and security personnel, they the ones were hired through agency and, you know, third party companies, you know, and just, you know -- and the funny thing, you know, it's sadly funny because, you know, a lot of people they were-- you know, people working in airport security, they were criminal and, you know, with felonies, charges and some had warrants, outstanding warrants for them and some had, like, faked IDs, faked identity.  You know, that was like a big joke, you know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- and now, okay, you know, whilst they were paying minimum wages and now, okay, they're going to be full employees, you know, paying good and -- paid good, you know, and, you know, hopefully they'll have degrees, you know, that kind of performance and the standard or all those things, you know, but, anyway, I don't -- you know, it's just -- just becoming strict, really strict, but, you know, we have to have some kind of, you know, sense dealing with people.  You know, like, okay, you know, women and senior citizen and kids, you know, they have to be, like, treated like somehow, you know -- these are not just like -- they don't represent any kind of danger, you know, and it's just, you know, sometimes, you know, they, like, overreact for saying few things like, you know, a senior citizen passing by because they got metal knees or metal pieces of knees or something like activates the fire alarm -- the -- the, uh -- the metal detector alarm, you know, and they just overact.  You see all this, you know, National Guards coming with M16, you know, and that's like -- you know, that's like -- like, it hurts, you know.  It -- it didn't happen to me but, you know, it hurts to see it happen to some older guy like that, you know.  So there is at least seventy something, you know, he's hardly walking, he's [inaudible] again and --
R:  I know.
L:  -- you know, and it's just what -- what -- what is the sense, you know?  They don't have any kind of commonsense at all, you know.
R:  I know.  The last time I traveled, um, actually I was trav- -- traveling with my mom and she had alzheimers and the -- the, um, security guard -- this is before nine eleven, this was in ninety eight, and the security guard wanted to search her because, um, we had her in a wheelchair 'cause we didn't want her to walk all through the airport and stuff 'cause you know airports are so large and we were in Dallas, um, I'm in Chicago, we were flying back to Chicago.  So [LIPSMACK] we had her in the wheelchair and security guard, you know, she stood right in front of her, blocked her off, saying, "Oh no, we have to search her because if she didn't go through the machine and stuff".  I said, "No, you are not doing that".  I said, [LAUGH] "You're not searching her".  So I got her off by -- out of the wheelchair and I just walked through the little, you know, metal detector or whatever that thing is --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- with her and, you know, they didn't really want me walking in through with her that way but, you know -- you know, she's got alzheimers, I mean, come on, you know.
