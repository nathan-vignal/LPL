L:  Hello.  My name is Andrew, I'm calling from New York.
R:  I'm Robert from New York.
L:  Right.
R:  Am I talking directly to someone?
L:  Ah, yes, you certainly are, Robert.  Ah, ah, I guess we're -- we're beginning the conversation here.
R:  What do you feel about airport security?
L:  Yeah, yeah, so, ah, I -- I guess, you know, when's the last time you travelled on the airplane?
R:  Um, about three months ago, man, and I'll tell you it sucks.  I almost had to be stripped down to my underwear and had an anal exam just to make sure I wasn't a terrorist.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But --
L:  No, you got -- no, you got to be serious.  I -- I mean, do you think that, ah -- do you think that the security is, ah, is tight?
R:  Yeah, it is like, I mean, I -- like I told you, I was just about stripped [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:  Seriously, and it took me a long time to get through.
L:  Really.
R:  But I don't think that that really like, does anything for terrorist attacks or whatnot because, I mean, pretty much if they want to get into this country, they're going to get in, like they're going to bypass it somehow.
L:  Well, yeah, you know, I mean -- I -- I, you know, on one of these other conversations we were talking about, ah, you know, the, um, you know, the -- the effect of nine eleven and, ah, security and, um, you know, I think that there's a lot of different things that could ultimately cause, ah, some other sort of act of terrorism, but I have to disagree with you.  I think that, um, the -- well, in -- in -- in -- the idea of someone getting on the plane and actually doing something, I think it does a wonderful thing to help stop people, stop, ah, possible terrorists, but there are so many other variables and so many other different ways that things could happen that, you know, I -- I -- I, you know, I got to wonder, you know, how much does it really help and --
R:  Well, yeah, I mean, and the fact that we've broadcast it and they already have people that can go through and test, you know, different ways of going in and realize, "Oh hey, we can't get away with this".
L:  Right, well that was --
R:  Still sneak across the borders.
L:  Right, well that was -- that was the whole thing with, ah, with the shoe bomber --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- kind of thing because he -- because he was basically --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- you know, a probe so to speak to go in there and check and see if this could actually happen, if they could actually get away with it.  So, um, so -- so they found out that no, this -- you can't really get away with doing that, but there's -- there's so many variables of different ways that it could happen that --
R:  But the bulk of that that they do let you on with pens and pencils.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  So, I mean, you could technically do it with that.
L:  If you're -- if you're -- if you're a trained assassin and, ah, you know, you -- you could, you could inflict a lot of damage that way but then again, just remember that -- that now that the -- the -- the +cockpit -- the cockpit doors are all reinforced and they're also, I don't know how many, ah, of the airlines, ah, have allowed their pilots to carry guns but there is a certain portion that do carry guns and there are also sky marshals on board.  But, there's --
R:  Have they started doing that for every flight?
L:  Well, that's the thing.  It's totally random.  It's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's totally -- it's totally random, so you don't know if there is a sky marshal on board or if there isn't a sky marshal on board, and that's something that -- that a potential terrorist has to think about but, you know what, if he's -- if he's going to do it and he's got a -- he or she has his mind set to it, then they're going to do it, they're going to try it no matter what, you know.
R:  And they probably wouldn't do it on a plane.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  That's kind of what I'm saying, is that like, I don't think it really hinders them all that much, I mean, considering the fact that most of 'em have been here for five to six years.
L:  Right.
R:  And, ah, they're probably more here.
L:  Right.
R:  But I -- I don't -- I don't know.  You know, when it comes to the point, you know, I completely agree with you though.  I mean, it sounds like they got it secure.  I didn't know that they had the reinforced doors now on the cock- --
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
R:  But I do know that the security going into the airports is tight as anything.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  But, now, what about through the baggage part, you know, compartments?
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's -- it's still like I say, that's one of those --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- kind of things like where it's -- it's too many --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- variables to consider.  I mean, you know, these guys, they -- these -- these baggage checkers and they're -- they're -- they're tightening up on that, but still there's too many variables of, you know, what the shape of this thing looks like and that thing looks like and whatever and new ways to conceal things and all dif- -- you know, I mean, it's -- it's just there's too many different possibilities of the way things could go down.  So, yeah, um, there's too many loose ends, but if they're -- if they're using any sort of model of something to go by, they should be talking to -- to the -- the airport in -- in Tel Aviv Israel, you know.  They -- all -- all, you know, all United States airports should look to, you know, Tel Aviv, Israel as a model of how to secure their airports.
R:  Are they secure?  Why, are they super hardcore security?
L:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, I -- I was -- I read, um, something, I think it was in Time or Newsweek, um, about a year or so ago and they mapped out basically how secure things are to the point of before you get to the airport, okay, um, you know, as you're driving into the airport, there are three different checks, okay, and then when you -- then when you get to, baggage, ah, you know, when you're -- when you're being dropped off, and, um, you're handing your baggage over to the -- the baggage handler, you know, you're being checked again and then they talked about things like, um, like trash cans that are in the airport itself are explosive proof trash cans.  So --
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, I mean, they're -- they're really, really very secure and they -- they have -- they have monitoring systems that are all over the place.  It's -- it's -- it's really -- it's an incredible approach to security, um, that was -- it was very, very detailed.  The question is, you know, that's -- that's, you know, they have one or two airports within the country of Israel, you know.  How many airports do we have in our country?
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so --
R:  The thing that scares me about this whole terrorist thing is that I'm originally from Orlando and I'm going back there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And there's so many parts there.  There's so much population there, especially once terrorism starts to go back up, you know what I'm saying?
L:  Sure, sure.
R:  So, like, we've got all these like people from, ah, Puerto Rico and stuff coming in on boats and stuff all the time that are able to get through the borders and what not, so it's kind of scary about those airports too, you know, about people flying out of Israel over to there or Palestine and what not, and then coming in through, you know, the boats and what not, taking the chance of getting caught but some of them, you know, actually don't and we have a lot of people down there that are not citizens.
L:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean --
R:  And, I mean, no one knows who they are or where they came from.
L:  Well -- well, you know, the problem being that, ah, you know, getting off the subject a little bit, the fact that, you know, we don't know about, you know, how much security is actually being -- is taking place within our ports throughout the country, you know.  We hear in the port in -- in New York, in the port in Miami, in the port in -- in LA and, you know, and these are major ports and there are -- there are thousands of cargo boxes that come in every single day, you know, and, you know, they can't check every single one of those things.  And, you know, so if there are -- if there's some sort of supplies or anything, and, you know, the way they -- they figure it out how the terrorists operate as far as, you know, their -- one -- one thing is doing one thing, the other thing is doing the other thing and they don't know what they're supposed to do until it's just -- there's -- there's too many things that are -- that are loose ends about this whole thing.
R:  A lot of variables.
L:  Yeah, and, you know, all -- all I can say is well, you know, at least they're trying to do something, you know.
R:  Yeah, well that is good, you know.
L:  At least, yeah.
R:  Trying to, you know, secure.
L:  At least trying, you know, but I don't -- I don't know how much good it's doing, but we can only hope that whatever they're doing, um, they're --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  They just -- they just get better and better at it.  Huh, that's all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really all we can hope for is that they get better and better at it, because if -- if there's even one time where -- where they slip up and someone gets through, then -- then we've got problems, you know, if -- if --
R:  But then, you know, like also with those attacks with the planes and the security systems that we already had, there's also the question about people in our government, in the CIA and such, that already knew of these people, you know, possibly planning these attacks and not feeding the information to other segments of the government in time.
L:  Right.
R:  So that they could stop it.
L:  Right, right.  Well, it's such a --
R:  And then there's also that question about, you know, how they actually were able to stop the plane that was hitting the White House but they weren't able to stop the one that hit the World Trade Centre.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not really sure about all that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like it seems a little its- itsy to me, you know what I mean?
L:  Well, there's such a -- such a, you know, big bureaucracy of all the government -- all those governmental agencies and, you know, it's such a -- a giant beast that's been put together now with this whole Homeland Security thing.  It's like -- it's like this giant overwhelming beast and, you know, still there's got to be a lot of bureaucratic red tape that's got to happen with that.  I just, you know, you know, I just hope, you know [NOISE] knocking on formica here that they -- that -- that they're doing the -- the very best they can because, um, you know, all it takes is one bad thing to happen and then, you know.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Then the -- then the country, goes back into turmoil again, you know.  We've been working hard to -- to -- to, you know, reposition ourselves to get --
R:  Were you actually up here when, ah, that happened?
L:  Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was -- I was working, ah, in the Flattern[?] district and, um, you know, got -- got to work early enough and someone said, "Someone ran a plane into the World Trade Centre." I didn't believe them, went up on the roof of the building where I was working and looked out at it and it was like, nothing is going to be
