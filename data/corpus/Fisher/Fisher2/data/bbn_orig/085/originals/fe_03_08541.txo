L:  [NOISE] 
R:  H- hello?
L:  Hello [NOISE].
R:  Hi, I'm Debbie, I'm from Chicago -- how are you?
L:  H- hi, I'm in Connecticut.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  The topic is airport security --
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE] 
R:  -- heightened -- is that it?
L:  High end airport security, and do we think that, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- with the security -- security it would, um, lessen the chances of terrorist --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [inaudible] [LIPSMACK] --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- um, have you traveled lately?
R:  [SIGH] No, I have not.
L:  When's the last time you traveled in the airport?
R:  Probably, I'd say a year before nine eleven.  Have you?
L:  Okay, yes, actually I traveled [SIGH] the month after nine eleven, [NOISE] I don't even think [NOISE] it was quite a month [NOISE].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And, um [NOISE], although I had heard that they had, you know, heightened the security and it would take longer to get through, ah, I didn't find that -- I didn't find it at all --
R:  Really.
L:  -- and, um, as -- as far as [SIGH] do I -- [NOISE] did I find it an inconvenience -- I remember the passengers who ah, and -- and as a result, when I heard about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- the heightened security I had given myself pretty of time to get there, so it just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I went through it so quickly --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that I found myself with so much time on my hands, that I had to actually sit around and wait.
R:  [SIGH] Well, you're -- you're better than I am, 'cause I'm a procrastinator --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and I can just imagine me going through the airport and missing [NOISE] my flight many of times --
L:  Mhm.  
R:  -- because of the fact --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that I would of procrastinated --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- ah, my last two flights --
L:  [NOISE] [MN] 
R:  -- oh jeeze --
L:  Uh-oh.
R:  I won- -- I wonder who that is -- me, or you, or them? 
L:  [NOISE] No, I don't know.  [NOISE]
R:  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- let me check my phones --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here, real quick --
L:  [NOISE] 
R:  -- make sure --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- oh, it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- kind of --
L:  [NOISE] Switch to another channel and see if that helps any [NOISE] --
R:  [NOISE]  [MN] 
L:  Hello, can you hear me?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Okay, um, so I'm al- -- I'm always a procrastinator, so, I -- I -- I've --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I've had to run through airports plenty of times --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, I live in Chicago and there's two airports --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- here in Chicago --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah [NOISE] --
R:  -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE] Mhm [NOISE].
R:  Oh, jeeze.
L:  Wow.
R:  Have you done this study before?
L:  I did it once before, mhm [NOISE] -- I don't remember having such interference on the phone.
R:  Hm.
L:  Okay, so, let's try it again.
R:  Okay [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, anyway, that -- I was [MN] here in Chicago, and, ah, we live very close to two airports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, the last time I flew out, um, I -- [SIGH] I don't know, I think at that point, the -- the -- the security had even gotten higher before nine eleven too.
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  So, I guess people are -- are used to, [SIGH] um -- 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I think, hm -- I don't know, but it -- it -- I guess it seems to be working 'cause there hasn't been any major, um --
L:  Incidents.
R:  -- right.
L:  I, um, had a -- heard, just recently, I think it may have been just yesterday -- yesterday or Thursday that, um, in some of the airports now, they're, um -- they're [SIGH] -- what are they doing?  They ha- -- at first they had you take -- remove your shoes before going through security --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- now, um, at le- -- um, at least it was in, ah, Hartford, Bradley International Airport, that now, they've, um, lessened that -- that you do not have to remove your shoes going through security, however, if for some reason you set off any of the, ah, security systems then they would have -- then it would take you longer to get through, I mean, then you would have to go through a thorough search --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so, I guess, they were saying it's up -- it's -- it's optional --
R:  [SIGH] [MN]
L:  -- [inaudible] so, either go remove these shoes and put them either on a conveyor belt, or in the little basket where you put your jewellery, and, ah, walk through, or, you don't have to -- they're not [inaudible] -- they're not making you -- it's not mandatory now that you take your shoes off, but, if you set off the system then they'll detain you longer.
R:  [MN] Well, you know, I -- I consider myself a liberal, and -- and -- and -- and all that, but I -- I have to say, I think they should be being a little bit more [SIGH] -- um, targeting some -- some types of -- of people, I mean, it's -- it's happened with a certain age --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, a certain type of person --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they -- they've usually been male, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, I -- I think they should be looking at certain people a little bit more.
L:  [SIGH] Well, I'm still having an issue -- well, to -- to answer the question that the -- the survey is asking -- do I think that this heightened security lessens the chance of terrorism?  I -- I think any -- any time you increase any security, it's gonna lessen the, you know, the chances of any -- any -- any occurrences happening, but, I still think that there is more than can be done, for instance, there's always been a -- an issue with the baggage, I mean, they never had any kind of system set up where they checked the baggage.
R:  [SIGH] Right, and also --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- the mail -- the mail going on -- on the airplanes --
L:  Mhm, mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] um, I think that needs to be more closely examined, because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I believe that is where our most vulnerable --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- security --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- right now.
L:  [SIGH] And -- and not only are -- well, yes, you know, [MN] we had the incidents on the passenger -- [SIGH] passenger, um -- um, airliners, but, however, think of all the commercial stuff, you know?  Who knows what the next plan is all about.  We certainly need to take a look at all of our, you know, travel, whether it's the UPS, the Federal Express, any of the commercial --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- airlines, we need to certainly take a look at that.
R:  If you -- if you think about it, that's pretty vulnerable.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, um [SIGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I guess if you -- once you get on the plane you could start thinking about all this, and it'll really start freaking you out.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] you're right -- yeah, although when I got on that plane in October, I felt that I was probably -- [MN] the safest I could be, you know, was right after the incident happened.
R:  Well, good for you [LAUGH].
L:  You know, I felt, well [MN] --
R:  I don't think -- I don't think I can be so positive --
L:  Well --
R:  -- myself.
L:  -- yeah, everybody in my family thought I was nuts, but it was -- I was -- certainly wasn't gonna drive fourteen hours, and, um, and I said, "Listen, if anything, I'm betcha it's safe as it can be now", because there was heightened security, and of course, it was security everywhere --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- dogs, and -- and it reminded me of Europe -- I was in Europe when we went through, um, the Metro and you actually see -- see, ah, security people with --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- rifles, and --
R:  I know, isn't that scary?
L:  -- I thought that was weird -- yes, and especially coming from a country where we didn't have that [SIGH], you know?
R:  Mhm.
L:  At all, and then to see that -- when I saw that, um, at the airport here, I thought, "Wow", that reminded me of Europe.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I had traveled to, um, Pakistan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, I was searched by a woman and this was, um, about, [MN] [LIPSMACK] sixteen years ago --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they had bombings over there and I had -- I had gone through a line and a woman physically searched me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, [SIGH] that was -- I thought that was odd --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, that happened to be in a Karachi airport --
L:  Oh, god.
R:  -- when -- when the bombings occurred there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I forgot what the reason for the bombings in Karachi --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but, that was on the highest end --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- that I've ever been --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- very scary, too.
L:  When you say they physically searched you, did they have to [SIGH] --
R:  They -- it [MN] --
L:  -- pat you down, like, you know, and ...?  
R:  They pat me down, um, they -- they -- they really pat -- patted me down, [SIGH] and if they thought in the slightest chance that I would have had something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they would of, um, had me do a strip search, no doubt about it.
L:  Mhm, sure, sure.  Did you think --
R:  But, um, that was -- 
L:  Wow, wow.
R:  -- a little scary, 'cause --
L:  That must have been some experience.
R:  Because, you know, you -- when you're traveling overseas, you're not an American, really --
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  -- anymore.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  [LAUGH] You -- you're a tourist from another country.
L:  You're absolutely right, that's true.
R:  And -- and you feel very vulnerable.
L:  Yes, yes, you're right about that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  How -- and then -- and then you add onto that [MN] a language barrier.
R:  [NOISE] Yes.
L:  You really -- you're really in trouble.
R:  Maybe I've seen Midnight Express too many times.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Have you -- did you, um, think that, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that we went a little bit overboard when we started, um, collecting nail files, and -- and umbrellas?  [MN]
R:  Once again, I believe that we were -- we were --
L:  We were a bit overly cautious?
R:  We were too cautious in one area, and not enough cautious --
L:  In another area.
R:  -- in another area.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you think -- [SIGH] when you're on a plane and -- and you think about what that plane is carrying --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and you think about --
L:  Fuel [several inaudible words] --
R:  -- all somebody has to do is put a package --
L:  I know.
R:  -- and fly it -- fly it first class.
L:  I know.
R:  So, I mean, [MN] I don't know.
L:  I know -- I know -- I know, it is -- it's scary.
R:  [SIGH] So, that's -- that's scary [SIGH].
L:  It is scary.
R:  But, you know, what -- it's a wake up.  It's a wake up.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  It's a wake up to -- to understand that we -- we're not an island.
L:  That's true [NOISE] -- that's true, you're right about that, wow.  [NOISE] So, I guess -- it's not ten minutes yet, huh?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Although it -- seems like, you know, when you talk [LAUGH] -- when you're on the phone --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- just socially ten minutes will go by quickly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you're on a survey ...
R:  [SIGH] Do you have any children?
L:  Yes, I do, I have sons -- three sons.  Do you have children?
R:  Yes, I have four daught- ...
