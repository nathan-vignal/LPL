L:  Tina.
R:  Hi, sorry.  What's your name?
L:  Tina.
R:  Tina.  This is Steve.
L:  Hi Steve.
R:  Nice to meet you.
L:  Nice to meet you too.
R:  I hope this call holds up.  I'm on a cell phone and reception is somewhat poor. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  I did- -- I couldn't really understand the first thing they said about the call.  Is it about um, what exactly did they say about professional athletes striking?
R:  I think they said, how do you feel about um, recent strikes by professional athletes?  Do you think their -- their salaries --
L:  Oh okay.  Worth it -- okay.  I heard the salary bit.  I wasn't sure what they said in that first one.
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it wasn't too clear.
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH] Okay, well you start. [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  I'm -- I -- I tell you, I'm not much of a sports fan.
L:  [LAUGH] Me neither.
R:  Um, so I don't -- I don't follow it in detail.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But um, it always seems to me that pretty much like most -- most pricing systems, they're probably worth whatever they can get.  And um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm not really sure where else that money would go anyway.
L:  Yeah.  I didn't even know, like, any recent strikes on -- you know, or what sport has had them.  Some of the -- the salaries, I think, are possibly a little insane.  But --
R:  But --
L:  -- you know, then you look at actresses and, you know, even CEO's, they're all kind of over inflated. [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  I mean, the athletes actually seem to, um, possibly do more work than most CEO's I'm aware of.
L:  Right.  And you know, and -- and the athletes definitely I think they're salaries are tied to a -- to talent.  Unlike Hollywood.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where it's just kind of tied to public perception or, you know --
R:  How well they've been dressed up or prettied up for the camera.
L:  Right.  You know, in sports it seems like it is pretty market driven, like, you know, if you start aging or not doing that well your -- your salary indicates that.
R:  Yeah.  And they have to -- they have to milk it while they can.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I -- I guess I'm not really clear um, without knowing the system in detail, so when they demand these prices, who is it who's coming up with the money?
L:  I guess it's the owner of the team.
R:  Who -- and they get paid, what is it, by the city?
L:  I don't know how that works actually.  I mean, I don't know what the connection is with the city and with the -- like the stadium, you know, the arena that they're playing in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There must be some sort of complex, you know, connection with all of them, and I'm sure the fact that, you know, beer is eight dollars at Yankee Stadium is directly connected to the fact that they get paid eight million dollars a minute.  You know? [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Yes, it's like popcorn prices --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at movies.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, I guess -- I guess I could see one being a protestable matter if it turns out that it's coming out of taxpayer dollars and then you might argue that, well, we just don't want to pay for it, period.
L:  Right.
R:  But it -- it's difficult to argue about what a reasonable price is for what they're doing without knowing, ah, all the grabbing hands in the middle.
L:  Yeah.  And I guess -- I guess the end result for people is, you know, ticket prices get crazy high.
R:  Yeah.  Which --
L:  So people get upset because they're just, you know, Joe Blow, the common fan and he can't go.  You know, he can't afford to go see a -- one game, let alone have season tickets.
R:  Yes.  And it's like where I live, I think, let's see, I guess we had the super bowl here recently in San Diego --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I think it hadn't been here for a long time, so there was a lot of talk about what had happened, where on the one hand it was great for the city that all these people came in from out of town, brought all these tourist dollars in.  But when you have people traveling across the country to go to a game it helps you realize how much they paid for those tickets.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's enough that most people just can't afford to go.
L:  Yeah, I mean you're not -- I wouldn't spend the money, you know --
R:  Yeah.  But it's not -- it's not like, yeah, it's not like you wouldn't -- you couldn't come up with the money, but within your values system you'd never choose to.
L:  Right.  Exactly --
R:  It's not that important --
L:  -- I -- I wouldn't see it as being worthwhile spending, you know, two thousand dollars on a ticket to a -- to a sporting event --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know.  But then I guess they do strike, I mean some -- I guess some of the strikes are um, you know, we're kind of thinking about the big stars who are making millions, but then I guess there's those little guys that are on the team and this is kind of their -- I guess it's probably their first career, I guess they go off and do something else at like, forty.
R:  Yeah, sports commentators --
L:  Yeah, but I know, I do remember in Italy a couple of years ago they -- there was a players strike that was threatened over like the clubs and the club owners who were trying to, you know, get out of pension funds and things like that for players that were injured, you know --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- they're careers were cut short.  So things like that I kind of get, because I'm like, okay, you know, there -- it's almost like a union.  You know, we're all on this team together and you can't screw them just because his knee blew out.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, at twenty four, when we didn't expect it.
R:  Yeah, you were going to make millions of dollars and now you're going to leave him hanging.
L:  Right.  Now you're just like, well, bye-bye. [LAUGH] You know. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's pretty tough.
L:  Yeah.  So I guess, I mean, in -- in that sense I think it's good that they kind of hang together as a team and make sure that they are -- or even as a league, I don't know if the -- the strikes are just individual teams or leagues.  But it makes sure that the non-stars are still getting a fair shake.
R:  Yes.
L:  But I mean, I -- I don't know that they are that much here.  You know, if they're always kind of -- or if -- if they tend to be more on an individual, just give me more money, sort of strike.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, I don't -- I don't really know how that works.  But if there's some star player on the team and that one person just refuses to play, what happens with the games that are scheduled?  Because the team's probably going to lose --
L:  Right.
R:  -- if that person --
L:  Or even not lose, I mean, they just might not even sell as many tickets and stuff, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like that's a big, you know, revenue maker for them and then they -- the team might be like, well, you know, we need you -- we need your presence to bring in the punters to come in and watch this.
R:  Yeah, I mean, maybe instead they should sell tickets to the ah, negotiations.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Actually that would be interesting.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I mean I bet you a lot of people would -- a lot of people would stop being fans if they saw that.  You know, just 'cause they'd be like, "You want how much?  For What?"
R:  Yeah.  I think it's also a jealous resentment that, for a lot of us, having a union like that would actually be a great thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and we're, you know, maybe jealous of not actually having that kind of leverage because we're more interchangeable.
L:  Right.  I mean it's like, yeah, it's like before when it was all industrial, you know.  The people in factories had unions.  Now most of the -- the it's all service industry and there's no unions.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So we're all just like, well, you know, and I -- we'll employ -- we're, you know, out +of here as soon as you say.
R:  That's right.  As seen --
L:  Which is pretty, you know, it is difficult.  I mean, it would be nice to have a union and have some sort of protection.  You know, in a sense of, you know, community.
R:  Yeah.  And there's -- there's always down sides but when we look at those -- those athletes and we see their salaries we think, it probably doesn't matter what the downsides are.
L:  Right.  You have a certain level of protection, you know, financial security.  I guess when you don't have the security you look for it, and once you have it you start looking at the bad things, you -- you don't take that as an asset anymore.  You're like, well, you know, I'd make this money anyway.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We- -- We'd have a much more adversarial relationship with ah, you know, with our bosses or, you know, we couldn't -- we couldn't have one on one sort of, ah, trips through the career path.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Things become very formalized with a union and subject to more corruption because there's more layers --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and so on.  So um I -- I'm not really sure, also when we, like we've talked about players striking, but like you said, if the whole team isn't a member then -- then you've got this situation of who decides who's part of the union for the players?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's like, on a -- on a factory floor, if somebody -- though there's always strikes, if there's somebody who goes around the union there, some -- I don't even know how a team could hold together with just a few people like that, where some of them would participate and others don't.
L:  Yeah, I mean like what happens then?  You know, do they have to have everyone on board?  And in that case it seems like it wouldn't happen that often.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, because you think most of them would be thinking, especially the non-stars, are thinking, well, I do need this job.
R:  Oh yeah. [LAUGH] 
L:  And I don't want to get branded as like the "difficult" baseball player.  You know?
R:  That's right, you've landed that kind of position and you're going to start bickering right away.  It's not the way to go.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You probably already have to be the guy who everybody already wants and --
L:  And then you can raise a fuss, but yeah, if you're just like, you know, Mr. left field every now and then, you know, people are going to be like, well, fine then, don't play.  You know?
R:  We'll find another high schooler.
L:  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  We don't need you.  Yeah.  So do you ever go to any -- any games?
L:  Um, occasionally.  I've been to a couple of baseball games.  I've been to a like, one football game. [LAUGH] I'm really not like that sporty.  But um, you know, it's -- I am always kind of shocked at like, you know, the -- the amount of money they do make.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, they really have a short career.  Which is something I never really thought about, you know.  I remember reading this article about like the fact that they had like, you know, financial -- the financial planning they have to do.  Because they have like a window of like maybe like ten years to make money --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- doing this, and then, you know, then they have to go off and they have to find something else to do and you know, if they're not a big name, what is it?
R:  And most of them, even if they did come out of college, so much of their time spent in college is completely focused on the team.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  Or on the -- on that tr- -- training for that, not probably what they're going to do later.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean I don't really think most of them are really like hitting the books seriously.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, wh- -- if they're -- especially if they're on like a football scholarship or you're like a, you know, big guy on -- you know, big guy on the team.  That's your dedication.
