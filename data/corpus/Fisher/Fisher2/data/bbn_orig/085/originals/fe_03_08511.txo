R:  Hello, my name is Kim.
L:  I'm Pam.
R:  Hello Pam.
L:  How ya doing?
R:  I'm good --
L:  [SIGH] [inaudible] --
R:  We're talking about professional athletes, huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've never done this before, so this is my first call.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, not a problem, we just kinda [SIGH] talk a little bit about the -- the topic involved, and what our thoughts and feelings are.
R:  All right.
L:  Personally, [LAUGH] I think they're paid -- overpaid.
R:  I agree with you on that, but I -- I mean, I think they're overpaid for [inaudible], but I do understand them getting a higher salary than someone whose, you know, less, um, [SIGH] like -- they -- they are -- they put themselves in the -- in the way of bodily harm, so, I think that they should get paid more, but I think, um, the lowest paid athlete gets paid a million dollars -- is a little ridiculous.
L:  Oh, I know, I mean, 'cause personally -- I [MN], you know, they sit there and they say that if anything was to happen to their career, they couldn't earn another -- a living doing anything else [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- first of all, I think that's not true, 'cause [inaudible] --
R:  It shouldn't be [inaudible] -- there's opportu- -- ah, the same opportunities as anyone else, if not greater 'cause they [several inaudible words] college.
L:  Oh, no kidding --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because a lot of 'em, too, they've -- because they were a celebrity at one point they've got all kinds of different opportunities, that the average person wouldn't even have.
R:  [SIGH] Do you think that they would be as, um, seen as much of a celebrity if they didn't get paid as much?
L:  I think so, because there's still a lot of people who enjoy watching, um, the various games.
R:  Gosh, yeah.
L:  [MN] People would watch football, I mean, people watched baseball when Babe Ruth was making hardly anything.
R:  Next to nothing.  Yeah.
L:  It didn't make a difference, people were still going to the games, people were still watching, it didn't make -- his -- his salary didn't change the way people like to watch the game, and I think that's just a --
R:  [SIGH] And -- and, I think there are just as high of a demand for people to wanna be athletes, because it's a job that people dream of, re- regardless of the salary.
L:  Right, because it's something that they love doing.  I think that you take away the love for the game, especially on the players' part, when all they're looking at is the salary.
R:  Yeah, if -- if you --
L:  I think --
R:  -- have to go on strike to get more money, you obviously have your -- I feel that they have their priorities incorrect.  If someone needs to go on strike, it needs to be the teachers.
L:  Oh, I mean --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm -- I think -- 'cause that's my thing, I think that we should pay our people in the United States, by, like, almost order of importance.  Our teachers are the most important people that are out there.  They're educating our next generation.  They should --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- be the ones who are being paid what -- basically what athletes are being paid, I think.  I think --
R:  Yeah, athletes are an extra -- going to a game, or watching a game isn't necessary -- it's gotta make -- it -- I mean, it's a -- it's an enjoyment, but it's not --
L:  Yeah, it's an [inaudible] --
R:  -- like teaching, where it's gonna change someone's life.
L:  That's right -- it's, I mean, there's a lot of inspirational people who are involved and everything else, but what they're doing -- okay, it's not rocket science [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it -- it -- it's not.
R:  Hit the ball, hit the ball [LAUGH].
L:  And, they're very good at what they do, and I'm not knocking that, because anything that you do -- if you're good at it, you should be -- you should be reimbursed for what you're good at doing, but it's --
R:  And, they are the best in the world, so -- so [MN] -- the best teacher in the world doesn't get paid, you know, what [inaudible] the best athlete does in the world --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and it goes -- I mean, it's just -- it doesn't seem fair in the -- you know, for any -- for most careers to be at that place, especially these people that are -- [MN] they're so young, as well.
L:  Well, see and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I think that because athletes --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- get the pay that they get, people get --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- a mixed message -- students are getting a mixed message -- why do I wanna go to school?  Why do I need to learn?  Why do I need to get an education, when -- if I've got the talent to be someone who is a pro sportsman, whatever that sport may be, I can breeze by -- the teachers are going to go ahead and -- and push me through because they don't want to, um, flunk the star +athlete -- athlete --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and everything else, and it doesn't realy matter what kind of skills I have, becau- -- in the way of education, as long as I've got the talent out on the field.
R:  Yeah, there's always that -- if the athletes, um, in -- I mean, even in college they all seem to get by without getting [several inaudible words] grades, and without doing as much work, because, they need to be able to play, you know, to play the game on Friday.
L:  That's right, I mean, and there are, I mean, there's always exceptions to every rule --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- there are athletes out there who do everything that they can to keep their grades up, and everything else --
R:  That is true.
L:  -- my sister -- my sister's a senior at, ah, Boulder University in -- in Colorado, here --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and she's -- she's on the golf team --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but my sister also has had a four point oh since junior high.
R:  Yeah, like that -- is she [inaudible] -- I mean, that's her priority.
L:  That is certainly her priority, because there has -- has been times when she has told her coach, "I can't do such and such tournament, because I've got a test, and this particular teacher is not going to let me go".
R:  Right.  It seems like --
L:  "I mean, I have to take the test, I can't be there, and it's more important for me to go and do this studying, than it is for me to be a part of the certain tournament".  I mean, she still goes to practice, and she still practices, but she may forego a tournament, because her education's more important.
R:  It is what should be the case with all athletes, but unfortunately I think that some -- you know, some people put other priorities, especially scho-, you know, scholarship sports, where they didn't even have to do well at high school to get into college --
L:  That's -- 
R:  You know, it's like --
L:  -- they would look good on the team --
R:  -- it perpetuates the [inaudible].
L:  -- therefore, they got the scholarship.
R:  Right.
L:  That's been, I know, a big thing --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- for my sister, because she got, ah, she got an education scholarship --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and she's on the golf team, and some of the girls that are on the golf team, that got scholarships because they were, um, in the sport -- they blow things off a little bit more, and she's always frustrated about it, she says, they're -- they blow off studies, they blow off -- they even blow off their game.  She -- my sister's -- [SIGH] we come from, like, a christian background, so, she's not a drinker, she's not going out and partying and everything else -- up until last year she was underage anyway --
R:  [LAUGH] So, she wasn't allowed.
L:  -- like -- like, that matters anymore, but --
R:  You know, I get that [several inaudible words] [LAUGH].
L:  The -- the students that were on the team with her, would be going out the night before a tournament, and getting wasted.
R:  Yeah, it's just frustrating for her, to experience that, you know.
L:  And, she doesn't have the golf scholarship, but she's golfing better than them because she's not hungover the next day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she's got the education scholarship, and the golf scholarships gave more money, so, those girls collect more money. 
R:  Well, and if you won't apply yourself to your academic studies, usually I -- I use -- apply yourself to other places as well.
L:  That's it.  So, I -- I don't know -- I think that the salaries are just ridiculous for professional athletes.
R:  [SIGH] Yeah.
L:  Granted, I know, they're putting their life on the line, but, if you're going on a strike because you're only making three million a year, or --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- some of 'em three million a game --
R:  And that's [inaudible].  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I'm like, you know what?  [SIGH] In my lifetime --
R:  And there's other careers that --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- there's other careers that put their life on the line, I mean, in the military --
L:  Firemen.
R:  -- things like, that, and we don't pay them, you know, three million dollars a year --
L:  Oh, no kidding, firemen --
R:  -- to put their life on the line.
L:  -- police officers.
R:  Yeah, [MN] exactly, I mean --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- [inaudible] police officers are, you know, [MN] are in a very dangerous [MN], um -- and we don't pay them three million dollars [several inaudible words] but, because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- athletes are -- are, you know, could hurt themselves, we do.
L:  That's the thing, because this is an --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- entertainment value, this is not something that is a necessity in life.  If people weren't playing sports, it wouldn't be that big a deal.
R:  Right, it wouldn't hurt anyone.
L:  It'd be kind of a drag, it'd be kind of a drag, because it's fun to watch and everything else, but it's not a necessity of life -- we're not all going to die, because -- because --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- somebody didn't play football last weekend.
R:  [LAUGH] Right.
L:  [MN]
R:  But, you know, I mean, other things we -- on other types of, um, you know [several inaudible words] things we [inaudible] -- other jobs that don't pay as much.
L:  Oh, yeah, if the police went on strike -- holy cow.
R:  There'd be some trouble.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I don't wanna even think about what would happen if the police, or even the fire department went on strike.
R:  Oh, no, it would be just horrible.
L:  I mean --
R:  It couldn't happen, you know?
L:  -- that would be the thing, and a lot of times, even though those people are so underpaid, they don't go on strike because they understand the importance of their job.
R:  Or, they're doing it for the common good.
L:  That's right -- they do it because of who they are and that's -- [NOISE] that's so commendable, but they should be reimbursed better for it, and people who are athletes should realize ... I mean --
R:  They should realize that they -- I mean, they are -- they are bringing in [inaudible] money for, you know, for the organization that they're involved with, but, you know, the fact that they get paid less, I mean, they should, I mean, they should be realizing how lucky to have it in the first place.
L:  Well, I think the other part of it is, the more money they get paid, the more they have to increase how much tickets cost to go.
R:  That's true.
L:  And, granted, there's always gonna be people who will pay, no matter what the price is --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but, for people who really like to enjoy seeing it ...
R:  Who don't have the money to spend two hundred dollars on a stupid ticket, you know?
L:  They're not gonna see it -- the real fans aren't even going to enjoy it.
R:  The real fans are in the living room enjoying it.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's it, and that's a shame, because, you know, they've just lost touch.  This is just a money machine for 'em now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's not a game --
R:  Because the more they raise --
L:  -- it's not a [several inaudible words].
R:  -- the more they raise the salaries, the more they raise the ticket prices, and so it ends up in the long run hurting everyone, a little bit.
L:  Oh, yeah, I remember when -- when they were talking about some of the stuff that the Denver Broncos -- they ended up a [SIGH] -- a lot of people were selling their season tickets, and they weren't going, and stuff like that, and ...
R:  Is that 'cause they weren't doing as well?  I don't rem- -- I mean, I don't really remember that.
L:  Oh, no, it was -- it was primarily because, they [SIGH] -- they were raising ticket costs to cover --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- to cover for the stadium, to cover for all these other things, and [MN] -- and it's like people [several inaudible words] ...
R:  Yeah, and sometimes you just can't afford ...
