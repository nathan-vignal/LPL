L:  Hi, this is Jodi.
R:  Yeah, uh, James.  How ya doin'?
L:  Hi, James.  How are you?
R:  Fine.  Uh, this is first time I ever connected to a female. [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I've never been connected to a female.
R:  Really?
L:  And this is my third call.  Yes.
R:  Yeah, you must be a, um -- I don't know.  Um, where you from?
L:  I'm from Philadelphia.
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  How about you?
R:  Yeah, I'm here in New York, yeah, yeah.  But anyway, um, yeah that, um, uh -- here in New York, of course, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the place of, uh, that, I mean, -fluenced, uh, that -- the increase, um -- you know, I think obviously it's a good thing but, um, sometimes here, I don't know if it's there, uh, also in all American cities' airports, but sometimes it's almost, um, frightening.  I mean, you -- you know, like New York, round the city here at the Port Authority and even a lot of the subways, um, uh, you know and the armed soldiers, uh .... well, I -- I guess what I'm trying to say is, uh, you know, I first notice it when I fly at the airport, uh, this -- this armed patrol that wasn't there through previous years and, um, you know, and, of course, um, I mean, the last time I went out of town, uh, the extended, uh, time it takes to -- to, you know, to -- to, you know, check your baggage and, you know, ended up missing a couple flights.  Uh -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I mean, I guess on one hand it's -- it's, um -- [LIPSMACK] I guess since nine eleven, yeah, it's something that's necessary, I guess, but I guess what I'm trying to say is on another level it is, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- almost -- almost like over -- to -- too much, you know, uh -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know if you get a sense of what I'm [LAUGH] trying to say here a little bit.  What is your, uh --
L:  I --
R:  Do -- do you fly much or you -- you ...
L:  I fly enough to say that I -- I guess, unlike you, I -- I mean, no much -- nothing is too much.  I'd rather miss a flight because I was late or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because things were ti- -- held back --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- than take a chance.  Um, I -- I know in LA where my sister is they actually scan the luggage before you get -- well, at curbside --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and any -- well, it's -- we're not nearly as sophisticated as we need to be for things like this but --
R:  Oh really, huh, huh, huh.
L:  -- I -- I -- I think we could be  -- the more -- look, no one ever -- it's funny, I was reading a magazine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that was from October of two -- of, um, ninety two --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- of ninety one, excuse me --
R:  Mm. [NOISE]
L:  -- and I -- and -- but it hadn't -- September eleventh hadn't taken place, it was obviously printed prior to, and it said something like our children are growing up in a time of peace and there's not this, there's no that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, I mean, ironically it ended up it probably came out two days before September eleven --
R:  [NOISE] Mm, mhm.
L:  -- and I have children and I feel like --
R:  Mhm. [NOISE]
L:  My son who goes to college in Florida, and even forgetting them, like when my parents fly, when my brother or sisters fly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I like the increased security.  I -- what -- if I have to take --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- off my shoes, if I have to take off -- I wouldn't care what I had to take off.
R:  Yeah.
L:  If they wanted me to go in back with a woman marshall --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's all about our safety and I -- I'd love the idea --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- of air marshalls --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, uh -- so for me -- uh, did you lose friends --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- September eleventh?
R:  Uh, did I what?
L:  Did you lose friends on September eleven?
R:  No, I never lost friends but, um, I, um -- well, I -- yeah, well, I -- yeah, I'm an actor and, uh, uh, an agent is in that vicinity and there were a couple of actors I knew in passing that, um -- one in particular was killed.  So, not close but, I mean, the agent's pretty close and, you know, I wasn't able to go in the office for a while and, you know ...
L:  Yeah, it's scary.  I -- I --
R:  [MN]
L:  I guess everybody on the east coast knows somebody.  I -- I mean, I knew --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- like, my sister's friend's brother in law --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but it's close enough.  I mean, his wife is now a widow, she was young --
R:  Yeah, yeah.
L:  -- but, I mean -- but, you know, she was my [inaudible] so tragic and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so unexpected that, um --
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, here in America you wouldn't, yeah -- and, of course, um, shortly after that, you know, we -- and we had to go down to visit the area and it was really like a war zone, I mean, and I used to go there quite frequently to see this agent, uh, and, uh, it was just, uh -- you know, you had to wear the face masks and it just really, uh -- it was really, uh, frightening, it's like pictures you saw in Europe during World War Two, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the, uh, streets and, yeah ... 
L:  I, you know, I really --
R:  But, uh, yeah, it was a terrible thing but, um, I don't know, getting back to security, I -- hm, I, you know, just feel awkward saying that, uh, yet I know it's -- it's for our good, the people's good, uh.  Uh, just the last, uh, time I traveled, about seven, eight months ago, I went down to Louisville, Kentucky, where I'm from, um, had an experience.  I think, uh, when I -- on my way home I went to a local thrift shop for some -- some -- picked up a bag, you know, uh, because I needed my luggage and, you know, I was stopped and, uh, they were screening, what do they take pictures or something of the -- what's in your bag with -- is that what -- what do they call that?  When you put your bag on the thing and they have some kind of, uh --
L:  The X ray machine that they --
R:  -- [inaudible], uh, something and then I was pulled aside and, do I have nitroglycerine in my -- you know, and, of course, I just got this at the thrift shop [LAUGH] you know and I said, um --
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, "Well, no, I mean, I -- I, you know, cleaned it out and it's my -- I just got this ..." and anyway they're pulling me aside and taking out all the, you know -- and it was just, not so much embarrassing but kinda really disturbing and frightening.  I thought maybe, possibly, if there'd been something in this bag I got at the thrift shop and I didn't even know --
L:  It -- it --
R:  -- and I'm gonna get locked up [LAUGH] and, you know, and there's a big thing --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- where they concluded that apparently there was chemicals from some kind of local drugstore medicine, it was nothing really, uh --
L:  They -- they locked you up?
R:  No, they did not but I'm saying the experience -- I was pulled aside, held up and they had to bring the supervisor over and supposedly, uh, there were signs with nitroglycerine, uh, chemical or something that was in this bag that I had brought at a local thrift shop that I, you know, like cleaned out and put my clothes in, sort of like, you know, and, um, it turned out, I -- I think it was harmless or they concluded that, um -- it may have also had something to do that I had some, um, you know, like mouthwash and some toilet articles I think I'd brought at the -- the Walgreens, uh, you know, it was something that came up on the, um -- what do you call it?
L:  [MN]
R:  The camera, the system they use --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but basically it was, you know, from labels at the pharmacy or something but, um --
L:  Yeah, it -- well, it's one of those things --
R:  -- it was just really disturbing, [LAUGH] some friends I bumped into in line and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- when you're pulled aside and they're calling the [LAUGH] super over and nitroglycerine is -- or chemicals or something are noticed in this bag and, "Where does -- is this your bag, what ...", you know [LAUGH] and I'm, "Well, I -- you know, I just picked it up at the thrift shop and I ...", you know, [LAUGH] and I don't know, maybe there was, you know -- but it turned out that the whole thing was innocent and I was let go, you know --
L:  I bet --
R:  -- I was passed on but, um, um ... hm, I don't know, what am I trying to say here?  I -- I see, like I say, their point possibly, hypothetically, if there had have been something, you know, although I'm innocent personally, is for --
L:  I -- I --
R:  -- you know --
L:  I think that it's that whole guilt thing, like when a police officer is in -- behind -- in back of you and ... we actually had an incident in Bermuda a number of years ago where apparently, we had Tumi luggage, and apparently that's the luggage of drug smugglers --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they started go -- and they really, like -- everybody else got their luggage and then they pulled aside, ours just didn't come out, and they looked through everything and, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you start to feel guilty --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but obviously we're not dr- -- well, we're not drug --
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] It may be not obvious to you [LAUGH] but we're not drug smugglers.
R:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
L:  If anything it was embarrassing 'cause I had, like, candy in there --
R:  Yeah, uh-huh. [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, like, pictures of my kids and it's just [LAUGH] -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I didn't care about my underwear so much as like, "Why are you traveling with this junk?" and I like junk food, so whatever but --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- it -- you know, it's just that guilt feeling of -- of, you know you didn't do it --
R:  Well, it's kind of a little frightening.
L:  -- although for you this is a --
R:  To me, it was -- it became kind of frightening because hypothetically, like I said, I just picked it up at the thrift shop.
L:  Right.
R:  Say, for instance, if there had of been, uh, like, a drug that I really didn't know anything about, I could have been held responsible, [LAUGH] you know, for something you didn't even --
L:  Right, well for --
R:  -- know. [LAUGH]
L:  Fortunately I would assume that the thrift shop would have had a record of you purchasing it so hope to god willing, and, uh --
R:  Yeah, I was standing there explaining to the guy, "I just got this at the thrift shop, I can --"
L:  [MN]
R:  "-- prove it, yeah".  I -- I, you know, had to go home and my mom would have my receipt and, you know, and [LAUGH] I'm standing there explaining all this but basically they were just saying something chemical or something in the bag that they'd noticed and they --
L:  Right, and I'm sure they looked at you like, "Yes, sure". [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, well, it -- it --
L:  They'd heard that before.
R:  No, I, you know, I -- I don't know, I -- I -- you know, it's disturbing if like what you're say -- you know, your experience but, on the other hand, I guess there is the logical -- there is a lot of things going on, there are smugglers and, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- of course, with nine eleven there are things happening --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so it's like just a part of me that understands maybe a certain necessity for that --
L:  Well, there is that necessity.
R:  -- [LAUGH] but then well, you know, when you -- on the other hand, there's a ... I guess it's the same thing I was saying originally in our conversation, uh, that -- that all this -- these armed soldiers at the airport and, of course, even here on trains, there's something --
L:  I think it's easier really to --
R:  -- well, disturbing although, you know --
L:  Maybe because they're a constant reminder but true -- and, look, a suicide bomber's not going to be affected by an armed soldier but to me they would make me feel more secure, I really would feel like, "Good, let them be here".  I -- I -- that's [inaudible].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, I -- I understand how terrifying it must have been for you --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I would have been, like, ready for, like [LAUGH] a drink.
R:  Yes.
L:  And -- but I think that, you know, they're only --
