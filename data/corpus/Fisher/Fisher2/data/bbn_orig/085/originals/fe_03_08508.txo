R:  Ellen.
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hello, how are you?
R:  I'm good.  How are you?
L:  Oh, fine.  I couldn't understand -- I couldn't understand what the topic of the day is.  Could you tell me what the topic of the day is?
R:  Oh, I think it was salaries for professional sports players.
L:  Oh, salary f- -- okay.
R:  Yeah, and ah, what --
L:  That, we can talk about then.
R:  Yeah --
L:  Because she mumbled it or maybe I didn't hear it right.
R:  Yeah, I didn't hear it too well either, but I think that's what it was. [LAUGH] 
L:  All right, well --
R:  So basically --
L:  -- salaries for professional sports players --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- much too high.
R:  Me too. [LAUGH] Especially in baseball.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, baseball is the worst, and basketball --
R:  It's ridiculous --
L:  -- all of them, so ah, I think it's ah, it's a- -- and I can tell you one reason.  I went the other day to a Met game.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they had the nerve to charge for a twenty ounce soda, four dollars they wanted!
R:  Wow.
L:  For a twenty ounce soda.
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  This is in -- this is in Brooklyn.  I live in Brooklyn.
R:  In Brooklyn?  Right.
L:  Yeah, well New York -- New York Mets --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- so I was not -- so to pay them outrageous like that --
R:  -- I think so too --
L:  -- plus the seats are eighteen to twenty three dollars.  I think they should all go.
R:  I think that's the lowest price.  Sometimes it's much more.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  No, and even on the ah, even on the ah, cable TV they charge you too much for the ah, well, for the specials on the sports --
R:  Right.
L:  -- they want too much, so I say I used to be a v- -- ah, average baseball fan --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and football, you know, I didn't go to many football games, but baseball, now it's cut it down to probably -- probably nothing.  Last year I went to two games, this year I went to one game and now I don't think I'm going back to them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'll listen on radio; I'll read the sports pages in -- in the paper.
R:  You do read them, or you don't?
L:  No, I will.  I read the sports pages --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but I mean I'm not going to ah -- I'm not going -- if it's on free TV I'll watch it.
R:  Yeah.  I mean --
L:  You know, but I'm not going -- I'm not going to pay them on cable like the -- like the Yankees network -- the Yankees network and all --
R:  Yeah, I don't get that.  I don't want to pay for that either. [LAUGH] 
L:  No.
R:  You know, I just kind of like, see what's on TV for free and um --
L:  Yeah.  No, I get the Sunday website[?] from the University of Pennsylvania so I figure it's legitimate.
R:  Y- -- I'm sorry?
L:  I said, I figured, I get it on the -- on the website --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and the University of Pennsylvania is -- is sponsoring this.
R:  Yeah, yeah, I -- I hope so.
L:  Yeah, so -- so I had a friend of mine, quite a few people, they don't want to give their social security number so they wouldn't sign up.
R:  You know what, I --
L:  They said it's too much, ah --
R:  Too much information --
L:  -- you know [inaudible] and all, so I said, ah, I said, "It's the University, I'll take my chances."
R:  [LAUGH] Well I guess we'll see soon enough.
L:  Well, no, I check my accounts.  I check any accounts I got all the time to make sure no one's ah, no one's doing anything illegal.
R:  Oh yeah.  Well hopefully it's okay.  I mean --
L:  And also, sports, I think -- it's like this case, I don't know if it's real with the -- with the basketball player --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they get special treatment.  These guys can do ah, can do the worst things and they treat them like if they're prima donnas.
R:  Now, is that a specific player?  Or -- you know?
L:  No, in general.  You have a lot of them that they -- they get locked up for -- for drunk driving or whatever, right?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  And they always give them, ah, you know, like, they give them special privileges.
R:  Yeah, just because --
L:  -- just because there's money involved, you know, and the --
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  -- and they -- and they don't want to lose them.  Like this guy, ah, Bryant, you know, the basketball player --
R:  Which one?
L:  -- the basketball player that's now in trouble with the law.
R:  Brian who?  Or -- I'm not sure.
L:  I forget his name, but he's -- he's the best one -- he's the best one on the, ah, Lakers.
R:  Oh --
L:  And he's in trouble, you know, and they said, you know, for sexual --
R:  Yeah, I know who he is now.
L:  Yeah, and ah, he's getting special treatment, you know, because they say he's an image and there's a lot of money involved --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, for -- with the, ah, shoes, you know, like, they get Nike shoes and all the other things, so --
R:  Yeah, well you know, he's a celebrity, so --
L:  -- celebrity, so I don't think that's right.  They always get the better end, it's always -- that's always -- like, I worked in a bank thirty one years and I always see -- the bigger the guy is, the, ah, the better they, ah, treat him.
R:  Right.
L:  And then always the poorer the person is, the tougher it is on them, and they're always just lawyers and anything else --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- celebrities or -- and if you go back, that's like with OJ Simpson, same thing.
R:  Yeah, exactly --
L:  He got the ah --
R:  He got off because he's an athlete.
L:  -- anoth- -- another -- another person, whether you think he's guilty or not, it doesn't matter --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but another person would have never got the treatment that he got in a million years.  The other person would have been behind bars and rotting in hell.
R:  Yeah, would be dead most probably. [LAUGH] 
L:  And -- and ah -- and ah -- and in that case because, you know, he was a top football player and this and that --
R:  Yes --
L:  -- he got away with it.  If you want to say, he got away with it.
R:  It's crazy.  It's um --
L:  No --
R:  -- you know, like, they should be considered just athletes, not like superstars, you know.
L:  Well, yeah, but -- yeah, but -- in this -- in this country, in the United States of America, everything is the dollar.
R:  Right.
L:  Everything is the dollar.  The dollar is king.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  More than king.
R:  Money rules.
L:  Yeah, [several inaudible words] so ah --
R:  Hm.  So are we supposed to -- is it going to end automatically, or ?
L:  No, ten minutes.  When ten minutes is up, they're going to cut in and they're going to say, say hello to your friend --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and that -- that's it.  I did it once -- I did it yesterday, you know, every forty eight hours.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  and the -- and the topic was ah, health.
R:  Health?
L:  And it was health, ah, if you do ah, exercise.
R:  Oh.
L:  That was yesterday's topic.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Exercise.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I told a lady I do no exercise --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- so that ended that.  [LAUGH] Then I talked with her, but I mean, ah --
R:  No exercise, huh?
L:  Yeah, that was -- that was yesterday's topic.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well that's interesting to have different topics like that.
L:  Yeah, no yes- -- ah, day before yesterday, it was every two days.
R:  Oh, it's every two days.  Okay.
L:  And then when I get my, ah, when I get my, ah, check, you know, I'm going to donate it to one of the charities.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Maybe Alzheimer's or some- -- I'd give it to anyone, you know.  So I'll take that check and I'll just donate it.
R:  Oh, good for you.  Are they just going to mail us a check, or ?
L:  I don't know how they work it, but you get, ah, if you do it three times you get ah, thirty dollars.
R:  Mm, I see.
L:  And you can do what you want with the money, of course.
R:  The other thing is, I also didn't in -- input my social security number, so I don't know whether it's going to work.
L:  No, well you ha- -- well I gave them -- you had -- in order -- in order to get a number, you had to input your social security number on the, ah, email.
R:  Oh, I don't think I gave it, but well -- anyway. [LAUGH] 
L:  You didn't?  Well -- I had -- otherwise you can't get on, in other words, to sign up.
R:  No.
L:  You had to input, that was one of the requirements.
R:  Oh.  Well.
L:  No other -- not much other information, but that, they ah, that they made it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So have you heard this thing about the, ah, baseball player hitting this woman in a suit.
L:  Oh yeah, you mean with the -- with the frankfurters and the weenies?
R:  Yeah, the sausage suit, yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah, the guy hit him with a baseball bat.
R:  Isn't that crazy?
L:  He said he was -- he was -- he was, ah, scared.
R:  He was what?
L:  Because they -- he was scared because they were passing by him and taunting him.
R:  What?  That's ridiculous.
L:  Well -- well they do what -- yeah, but of course -- but you see, everything is money because they usually have, you know, crowds of maybe twenty thousand, you know, fifteen thousand, but because they have the gimmicks they had a full house there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so they bought in twenty five to thirty thousand people.
R:  So like now this guy is not even going to, like, go to jail or anything like that, I mean --
L:  No, no, no, they're going to -- he repented.  He said he's ah, sorry he did it and they're not going to lock him up or anything.
R:  So he's just --
L:  But he hit the girl and -- and she fell over the, ah, with the costume and all.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they were showing it on CNN, you know, and all the --
R:  Yeah, I saw it.
L:  -- stations.  It was funny.
R:  It was crazy.
L:  Not funny, but I mean I got a laugh out of it.
R:  Lucky she didn't get hurt seriously when she fell down. 
L:  No, she didn't -- she didn't get hurt.
R:  [LAUGH] But I -- I was just wondering why would he do something like that? [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, no, probably because they paid them to do it.  She -- she -- the girl, or one of the girls was nineteen and the other one was twenty one --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- college girls, you know, and that's like -- they give them a job, dress up as what they want and run around, you know, and get paid for the day.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so more or less a gimmick.
R:  Yeah, I guess.  Huh.
L:  But otherwise, ah, wh- -- which state are you?  You ah ?
R:  I'm in New York City.
L:  Oh, that's where I am, so they give out by New York City.
R:  So may- -- yeah, so maybe they connect people by state or ah, I guess.
L:  I don't know how they do it.  Because I did it one other time and I -- I was talking to someone from Texas.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I don't know how they -- how they do it.  That's -- that's why --
R:  So it's just a coincidence then. 
L:  Yeah, yesterday I was talking to so- -- a lady from Texas.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Out near, ah, she said she lived in -- in the boondocks.
R:  She said what?
L:  She lived in the boondocks in Texas.  So in other words, in a small town.  I never heard of the town.
R:  I never heard of it either.
L:  That's where she lived.
R:  Oh, interesting.
L:  So, I said -- no, I'm in Brooklyn.  I don't know if you know Brooklyn?  Right near King's Plaza.
R:  Brooklyn near King's Plaza.  Okay.  I know where that is --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I'm in Queens.
L:  Oh, you're in Queens.  I know some people in Queens.
R:  Yeah, in ah, Long Island City, actually.
L:  Oh.  All right, that isn't too bad.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- they should be cutting in any minute now.
R:  Ah 
L:  You know, it's supposed to stay on for the ten minutes.
R:  Oh, okay.  So what time is it?
L:  So, I don't know what time exactly we started, but --
R:  Yeah, me neither.
L:  I think it is close to ten minutes now, so they -- they'll be cutting in and saying, say goodbye and I'll
