L:  Hi, my name's Alice.
R:  Hello, I'm Andy.
L:  Okay.
R:  Or Andrew.  How are you?
L:  I'm good thank you. [LAUGH] So, um -- Hm?
R:  I'm in San Francisco.  California.
L:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Yes.
R:  How's everything down in LA?
L:  Um, they're -- they're fine.  Um, are we -- are we supposed to be talking about um, the particular --
R:  Yeah, well I don't know anything about sports, duh.
L:  Okay, well all I know is that, I mean, they're really, really highly paid. [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Well, I know the fact that, I mean, I used to be married to a pro- -- professional baseball player --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- yeah.  I'm -- I'm a feminine male.  Or gay.  Basically.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm from the east coast and moved here to San Francisco, and well, at the time I thought he was -- the pay was reasonable.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Hm, like reasonable for -- for like what they're doing?
R:  Right.
L:  Hm.
R:  But because they have to go through a lot of BS too, because, you know, the um, the people, ah, what do you call them?  The people that take pictures of them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- the same person that killed Diana, ah, Diane over there in England -- Paparazzi, and they start rumors and stuff about them --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- they have to go through that, you know.
L:  That's true.  I mean, I think basically with sports people they're just, I mean, they're seen like, as movie stars except they're -- they have a different scale, I guess.  They're all entertainers.  Because people pay a lot of money to go and see them.
R:  That's true.  And I als- -- I mean, being married to him, a lot of what -- I had to dress in drag a lot, okay?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Which, um, back then I was a female impersonator.  That was one of my jobs up north, that's how him and I met, and when we split up I came out to San Francisco to be myself, not anybody else.  Because I think in California it's more open to gay people than anybody else is back east.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Than um, no, I um, people back east, I mean for the sports, or sports media is like, "You gotta be this way and you gotta be that way", you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, just like somebody -- you've gotta measure up to their scales.  I don't -- I don't think anyone of us should have to measure up to anybody's expectations, except their own expectations of our own selves.
L:  Mhm.  Um, I know they mentioned they're calling[?] like, a striking, like, are they -- are they striking for higher salaries?
R:  I don't -- yeah, I think so.  And health benefits, because a lot of big -- a lot of the government has basically cut a lot of funds -- um, funds and money so people are like, pulling back their money.
L:  Oh, okay.  So like, I guess, unless like, they're not getting as much support as they used to be?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know, I think -- I don't -- I think -- I mean, if the economy is -- is not doing as well I -- I don't think that -- I don't think that, you know, they have their special right to demand higher salaries, because I mean -- I mean, people are getting laid off and people are like, you know, taking pay cuts, and like, I mean they're not complaining. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well personally, I know that.  I work in the health profession.  I'm an [inaudible] advocate.  Um, I try to get people that are HIV established in the network.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Better benefits for 'em and a lot of people that stop alienating them because there's a lot of people that alienate against people that are HIV, or that have AIDS or however it's classified now.  And I'm living in this -- I'm -- well, I live in San Francisco and it's very small.  I -- I don't know how you, in Los Angeles, you'd see, I live in like skid row, I guess is another term for it.  I live in the tender line.  I don't know if you've ever been to San Francisco or not?
L:  No I haven't.
R:  But um, the tender line is kind of um, upper lower class, kind of like a middle class but between lower class and middle class.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Element, because a lot of people are like, shoved into this area --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- low budget and low incomes and fixed incomes and so forth like that. [COUGH] But ah, I know a few people that are, who are like, my -- my recent hu- -- my present husband's a football fanatic, and he's like, "Oh, let's go to football games."
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  'Cause he's -- he's a Forty Niners fan.  What can I say? [LAUGH] I had to learn how to deal with people -- learn how to deal with people that are athletically inclined or athletically in tune with it.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm more or less an artistic person --
L:  Yeah.  I -- I would say the same.  I'm not as into sports as a lot of my friends, but I don't know, I -- I know that still, a lot of my friends are really into going to sports games and stuff like that.
R:  I like museums, art and music, ballet, the opera. [LAUGH] Things like that.  Whereas sports, like, oh well, so what?  They're throwing a ball, what're they going to do, hit it with a stick? [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, but I mean -- I mean the American public likes to pay a lot of money to see that and that's -- that's where the high salaries come from.
R:  I know.  But a lot of people make their money there.
L:  Yeah, I don't know, at the same time it is sort of outrageous that they are getting so much money.  If you think about like, how many people are like, doing without and ah, they're making piles and piles of money.  I mean, along with anybody that's really famous, I mean, they're getting paid more than the president. [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, I think they should get paid more than the president, or this president anyway.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I mean, that's my point of view, okay?  I mean, I can't claim much about it because, I mean, we all know, excuse me, we're all Americans here, okay, we all know he -- he stole the presidency, or basically, okay?  I mean, that's how it looks.  Because his brother ran, was the governor of Florida and they found ballot boxes in -- floating in the ocean.  Excuse me, how did they -- how did the ballot boxes get in the middle of the Atlantic ocean?  Duh.  You know?  I don't understand that, you know, especially his brother being governor and they wanted to recount ah, certain votes when he -- when he -- when there shouldn't have been.  See my --
L:  Uh.
R:  -- see my angle on this?
L:  Mhm.  Well it's gone and past.
R:  That's why I think athletic -- our athletes should, I mean, that's why I said athletes I think should be paid more than this president.
L:  Well, I mean, it takes -- I agree, it does take a great deal of talent and a lot -- a great deal of like, hard work to -- to get where all those athletes are now.  It's just that, like, um, I don't know, I feel that I don't think they should be complaining and striking about their salaries.
R:  I don't think they should strike.
L:  Because they still have a lot more than most people in this -- in this country.
R:  That's true.  Look at Michael Jordan, okay, he -- he's HIV positive --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- okay, and he went back to playing the game, okay, basketball.  That's his sport, and he's promoting, "Hey, I can do this, you can do this", okay, giving a positive outlook on life in all around angles.  Okay.
L:  Mm.
R:  I admire him very much, because a lot of people like, from my experience have been -- have seen people shunned because if their friends find out they're HIV, you know, what you'd call heartache.
L:  Mhm.
R:  More or less [inaudible] you come back to the circle, you know, who get -- who's getting the pay cuts and who's not getting them, and who's making more money than who -- I mean, does it really matter?  Or -- I mean, I don't think it really does matter.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Money's not -- money's money.  Okay, I'm not going to die tomorrow if I don't have a dollar in my pocket, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I mean these athletes, I don't think they should be striking, you know, and I think they should look at it from a different point of view.
L:  Mhm.  Definitely.
R:  So.  How's the weather down there?
L:  [LAUGH]
