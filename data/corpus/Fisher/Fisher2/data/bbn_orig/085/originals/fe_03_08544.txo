L:  Hi, my name is Janise.
R:  I'm Doris.
L:  Hi Doris --
R:  I don't --
L:  -- how are you?
R:  I'm fine.  I don't really fly, but, I do think that we need more security in -- in, ah ... for the airports.
L:  Yeah, I agree, we definitely --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- need it. We --
R:  I mean, there's just too much going on [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, I, um -- I was a flight attendant for six years --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um, I remember, you know, how lenient we were, um, I flew between the years of eighty nine and ninety five, and I remember the situation when the Gulf War came about, um, that was my first time experiencing a heightened, ah, level of security in the airport --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they took it very seriously because prior to that, as a flight attendant, I used to um -- you know, we took tickets, you know, to -- to board the plane and everything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- well, when they heightened it, um, we were instructed to tell, um, our customers -- 'cause a lot of times customers would ask, you know, "Ah, can I leave my bag here while I go to the restroom?", "Could you watch my [inaudible] -- I'm gonna run to the restroom, and then I'm gonna get on the plane", [SIGH] um, or they would get on the plane and then get off for a minute to go out and talk to someone and get back on, well, during this heightened level of security we couldn't do that, and it was very confusing to the public, because they thought that we were being rude, or snobby, or you know, and so, I had a lot of customers telling me, "Well, I used to be able to leave my bag, here, you know, what -- what is your problem?  How come you can't watch my bag?".
R:  Yeah.
L:  A- -- and, um, I was very upset with the system at that time, because what we were doing to heighten, ah, security, we should have been doing all the time -- it shouldn't of just been, ah, increased because of the Gulf War happening and then, after the situation with the Gulf War, we went back to normal.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And I didn't -- I did not like that.
R:  Yeah, [MN] I can see it [LAUGH].  I know [MN] -- they always showed on TV, how they'd go through the, um, scanners and everything --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and I -- I -- and I thought, you know, everything had been checked and stuff, but, [SIGH] then you see where this one has been hijacked, and that one, and you wonder, "Well, what's going on here?" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, they even turned down -- the -- the level of the scanner for what it was sensing for --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so, we could have -- we could have been -- we could have been hijacked at any given time -- they were so lax.  The other thing you had to realize is that, um, I -- [MN] the people that [MN] -- that they were using to -- you know, when you went through the check points --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- [inaudible] prior to the heightened security -- the people that they were using -- they were barely paying them minimum wage, and so, you get what you pay for.
R:  Oh, that's true, I mean --
L:  And so, I remember even in reporting for work, they would, um, in passing, you know, and there was -- because our -- our luggage had to go through xray al- -- you know, through the, um -- the checkpoints also, and I would hear them saying "Oh, I was out late last night, and I'm -- a -- a hangover", and they weren't even looking at the screen and what was going through.  [SIGH] 
R:  They were more or less talking to each other.
L:  They were talking, right --
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, like I said, you -- you -- you get the type of people that you pay for -- if you get these you- --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, who's gonna work for minimum wage?  Young kids who are not responsible, you know, that hang out all night, and they're just trying to make a little change to support their habits, so --
R:  Either that, or -- or they take in -- do get a good worker and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- they work him to death.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I've noticed that in the nursing homes, too.
L:  Exactly.
R:  I mean, when they got somebody that cares, and wants to do their job, then, they're called in constantly.
L:  Exactly, the ones that [several inaudible words].
R:  And -- until they burn -- until they burn 'em out.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's the truth, and those are the ones that probably could make it to work all the time, because they didn't have hangovers.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [SIGH] So, you know, so, that's what we were getting, and on top of the fact, um, I can honestly tell you, you know, I don't -- I no longer work for the airlines, but, um, [LIPSMACK] there were things, you know -- we were able to go shopping and find different things all over the world, and I -- it was something -- because I am afraid of guns -- I always, always wanted a, um, a stun gun, you know, one of things --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you can use, well, those were illegal, but, um, I remember I purchased one in California, and I was so afraid 'cause if I had ever -- if they had ever found that -- and I was trying to get it back home -- if they had ever found that in my luggage I could of lost my job, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I was able to get it back here -- I'm in Michigan, and I was able to get it from California --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- because nobody bothered to pay attention to what was in my luggage.
R:  And, those are kind of scarier, to think of what else could of went through.
L:  Exactly, and so -- and -- and so, I'm --
R:  You know, it just [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, exactly, so, as of September eleventh, you saw what went through, because they weren't on heightened, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- security alert, and so, um, and -- and on top of this fact, because they even paid less attention to what was in my bag because I was a flight attendant and I was in uniform, well, it was later discovered for -- for nine eleven that a lot of the box cutters and things were -- were -- were snuck in by, ah, some employees that they had, you know, badges were stolen and that sort of thing.
R:  Oh, [MN] jeeze -- I -- I'm glad I talked to ya, I didn't really know part of this stuff [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, they don't really tell -- I mean, they tell you what they want you to hear.
L:  Exactly, because, um --
R:  You know, on the news and that, and --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- I gotta admit, the people that get mad and really upset with the people that's doing their jobs --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are the first ones that's gonna complain if something happens.
L:  That -- you know what?  That is the truth -- I remember when I was a flight attendant, um, you know, a lot of times things were delayed, um, and they were la- -- they were really delayed for -- for safety issues --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if the weather w- -- if it was sunny here, but our destination -- where we were going, it was, you know, ah, bad weather, or -- or -- or even, worse yet, ah, really bad turbulence in the air -- we would be delayed for those reasons, and I remember passengers would -- would just cuss me out about having, you know -- "I'm gonna, um, I'm not gonna fly United anymore, and I'm not gonna do this, and I -- you're not gonna get my business because every time I fly, I'm late" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I remember I would tell the passengers, "I would rather be late than dead". 
R:  Really.
L:  Simple as that.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I -- and like I say, those are the people that if anything would happen to one of the members of their family, they would blame the --
L:  They would have a fit.
R:  -- you know, they would blame the, ah, airport -- the --
L:  That is the truth.
R:  -- I mean, it's -- I mean, it's usually the complainers that really make up the big fuss when something does happen.  [LAUGH]
L:  That is the truth -- 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I was telling my husband, um, our biggest -- my biggest problem on the airplanes were businessmen.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
L:  The educated -- the educated businessmen -- they were the ones that would throw the tantrums and fold their arms and -- and pout, just like a little child, and -- and, you know, and I -- I would, um, you know, and putting luggage away -- luggage needs to be put away, again, for safety reasons -- not because we're trying to stop you from using your computer or anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like that, but, those things become flying missiles in the event of bad turbulence that could hit someone in the head, and, um, kill them, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  But you don't, you know, as a passenger you don't think that far ahead, and you don't have to -- that's what we're there for, but, you know, you -- people don't wanna respect what you say --
R:  You can't be there every minute, I mean, every --
L:  No.
R:  -- I mean, it's just like taking care of a child, you can't --
L:  Right, and you -- and --
R:  -- stand beside of 'em every minute of the day, [LAUGH] I mean it's ...
L:  No, but -- and you have to respect what the flight attendant says, she has knowledge and -- instructs you to do that, because there's a reason for doing it.
R:  Yeah, and you've got --
L:  And, so, I used to tell 'em.
R:  -- you guys go through pretty good schooling to have that too, don't you?
L:  Oh, the [inaudible] -- the -- the -- the -- there's -- the, ah, training when I went there was six weeks, um, but, now I think it -- well, when they were hiring before nine eleven it was seven weeks, but, it is extensive, it is mentally challenging --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, ah, they just gr- -- they just, I'm telling you, they almost brainwash you for those six and seven weeks, [SIGH] um, so, yes, it -- it's very extensive training, you know, but you have the people who talk during the, ah, you know, when they do the safety thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- before -- you have people that talk and don't respect that, but, like, you said, they're the very ones that want to know what to do when it feels like the --
R:  When -- yeah.
L:  -- plane -- plane is gonna crash.
R:  And, they're the ones that blame -- the first one to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- complain, or blame, when it -- something does go wrong.  [SIGH] I --
L:  That is the truth.
R:  -- I mean, I -- it's about the sa- -- you know, I -- like, I said, I've never really flown, but, I've just heard so much on TV about it and everything, and I -- you know, I just thought that they got it up so high now that it takes you forever to get through the airport the way some of 'em talk, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if -- if they could --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- rush right in and have another nine eleven, then what?
L:  Right.  That's the truth.
R:  You know?  [LAUGH] I mean ...
L:  The other -- you know it's funny, 'cause you could just -- before this, you could just -- anybody could walk in our airport, anybody could do anything and stay there -- there were so many bums and homeless people [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- living in the airport -- [inaudible] is what you know --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- how anybody could get in there, but, when we -- when I flew to other countries, security was so tight, and it -- their security was always like that.  Ours was always lax, and theirs was always very +tight -- very tight and secure --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- so, I'm hoping -- and, yes, it does take a long time for us to get through and it's a hassle, 'cause our next vacation -- as a matter of fact, we're driving --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but [LAUGH] -- but, I'm glad that they -- that it's heightened and I really hope that they don't get to a point that they're comfortable again, and let it go back the other way, because then that -- something like nine one one could happen all over --
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  -- again.
R:  I mean, they're just waiting for us to relax again, to take --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- advantage, I mean [SIGH], we've got too much confidence in ourselves, I think, sometimes [LAUGH].
L:  It's true, we are so cocky, and -- and -- and -- and so -- and we're so reactive, we're never proactive --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we wait for things [inaudible] -- for things to happen, and then we react to it and talk about what we should of did, and how, you know, if we had done this, and I'd rather just go ahead and do it, and we don't ...
