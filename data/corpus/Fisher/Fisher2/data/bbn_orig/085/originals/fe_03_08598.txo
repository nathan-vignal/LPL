L:  I'm Barbara.
R:  Hi Mark.
L:  Hi Mark, how are you?
R:  I'm doing okay, how are you doing?
L:  I'm doing alright.
R:  Well what are your views on, um, on the Middle East?
L:  The Middle East.  Actually I have been thinking about that yesterday, um, and then they was asking do I think that peace will be obtained in the Middle East.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Actually I think anything is possible and then they was asking if the US, um, should interfere, um, with that.  Hm, now that's the point that -- now I'm kind of like, um, I think they should.  I think they should interfere, I really do because it Saddam to me like a  -- he reminds me of a Hitler, a dictator you know it -- that's what it reminds me of, it's like he's all god -- all powerful and stuff like that.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ask me when the US went over there and, um, when our troops went over there and ask me, you know fought this war and stuff like [inaudible] he's in hiding somewhere -- we think he is or he could be dead we just don't know but then the people feel a little bit better, they're you know they're happy and stuff like that even -- but what's her -- what's her name the uh, lady that um -- what's her name Lynch -- I'm just not sure right now, um, the lady that they um -- what's her name mhm -- I know you know who I am talking about, um, anyway the military lady --
R:  Oh, on our side?
L:  Yeah Jennifer -- Lynch -- the young girl that they -- they rescued.
R:  Oh, Jennifer Lynch.
L:  Yeah right, even one of their people told -- actually told the US, um, where she was.  He's put his life at risk so actually I think the US is really you know doing -- I think they should -- I think they actually -- I think they -- I really -- I -- I think so.  So what do you think?
R:  Well you know I don't disagree on a certain level, um, I think one peace can be achieved, I don't think you know we'll probably never see it in our life time and if you look back over the course of human history it really hasn't been any time where there's been a lasting peace, so maybe that's a bit of had pipe dream.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, but anything is possible and we have to work towards it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and should we be involved?  Yes, I think I we should because otherwise, um, you know if we're trying to effect any kind of change we're trying to effect any kind of influence we have to keep, um, you know our hands involved in order to you know to have any effect on anything.  However whether or not we should be militarily involved the way we were that's, um, that to me is a different question it's a case by case question.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know I don't know if you're a democrat or a republican.
L:  Um, actually I am, uh, -- actually mines is like, um, [inaudible]
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Either I'm -- I'm really not a -- a what do you call it a republican.
R:  You're in a registered [inaudible]
L:  Right -- right independent right.
R:  Um, well you know right now the -- everybody will agree that Iraq is better off without Saddam Hussain no doubt about it.
L:  Right.
R:  On the other hand the whole reason we went in there was not because we needed to get rid of him we were told, it was because there's weapons of mass destruction.
L:  Okay.
R:  Well we haven't found them yet and maybe we will find them but a lot of the reasoning that we went in there seems to be phoney and false and maybe we could of waited longer, um, you know there's on old saying in history which is a very wise saying I think which is, just because the other guys evil --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- don't automatically assume that makes me good.  Just because my enemy is evil doesn't make me good.  Um, and I do think he's like Hitler and I do think he's a horrible human being in the way he treated his people and he's an awful awful awful person, um, but you have to ask yourself why does the United States allow some awful people who are our allies -- we let -- we let them go ahead and do what they want.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know Saudi Arabia is our friends because we buy oil from them and you know how they treat women?
L:  Probably, huh, horrible.
R:  Horrible, horrible yet they're our friends.  Well that's because we buy things from them we just don't buy anything from Iraq so we can kind of you know blow him up.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, um, you know we have to look at things in a case by case basis, um, so but in the over all I actually agree with you, you know yeah we should be involved and yeah maybe we can achieve these.  But, um, within that everything is a case by case basis and Iraq is one case and, um, you know hook at, um, look at Israel for example.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, to be you know there's nothing wrong, um, with being pro Israeli on the other hand if you want to have a peace process over there well maybe Israel has to turn the other cheek you know and let -- is it okay for Israeli's to have a home land and Palestinian's no?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just because these people are Arab's they can't have a place to live but Israelis can?  And unfortunately if you say that, people say you're anti [inaudible] or you're anti Jewish.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and it's very unfortunate that you can't debate the issues as they are because everybody likes to say, "Well if you're against the war you're anti American".  No I'm just against the war, doesn't mean I'm anti-American.
L:  And then if you're for it then you're a murderer.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You're a murderer.
R:  Exactly and -- yeah just because you are for the war doesn't mean you're you know a warmonger or something like that.
L:  Right.
R:  So yeah you know it's, um, -- I -- I -- I agree with you on, uh, -- on those issues.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, you know in terms of -- of peace I mean you know there probably will not be peace any time soon because there's so many years of built up hatred.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Even if say we turn the other cheek and we were nice to terrorist for a few years and Israel was nice to terrorists for a few years --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well they've been put down for so many years by their own Governments, by -- they whether we put them down or not they feel we've put them down.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And that so we might not of done anything but they think we have, so they hate us and it doesn't matter if we're going to be nice, they're still going to attack and still come after us.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you know --
L:  And then -- and then I was thinking like, um, we know the story that, um, what they did us first, they blew up whatever we know the story but then I'm thinking you know I -- I was [inaudible] war too but then I'm thinking I was like you know like the President said we -- we are not going to take it -- you -- you know we're not going to take it, you're not going to keep pushing us around and we won't take it -- you know so I was thinking I was like actually you know it -- it's just -- I don't know -- kind of confusing actually but then I'm thinking I got really kind of like, um, scared the words like paranoid because I'm thinking as it was going on and they said well days later and it's going to start now I'm actually looking up in the air, um, thinking like, um,  I'm so young I need to plan my funeral and stuff like that so it is just -- I just I don't know it just had me kind of scared.
R:  Well you know all Americans you know where ever you live you have got to be a little more vigilant --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than ever before but you know you shouldn't be too scared about such things but, um, you know what it's a matter of time I mean just, uh, in terms of technology it might be five years, might be twenty years, night be eighty years, might be one hundred years.
L:  Yeah that's true.
R:  Some joker will get their hands on a nuclear weapon and blow a city up.
L:  Yeah that's true.
R:  It will happen it just might take some time for it to happen.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, just like September eleven it was a matter of time you know they attack Israel all of the time, they attack Europe sooner or later they were going to attack here it was just a question of how and when.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And nobody expected it to be the way it came.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who knows you have just got to kind of live your life and --
L:  You're right.
R:  Yeah, go about it.
L:  That's right because anything can happen you can just fall in an elevator --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know and not -- you know what I am saying they could have been exactly September eleven I'm just saying September eleven fall in the elevator but what we are going to think the terrorists hit it?  No, it's just something that has happened in your elevator so you're right -- you're just -- you're right you got to just go about life as usual.
R:  Exactly, um, and my view -- I'm much more scared now of say, um, terrorism than ever before particularly like quote unquote Arab terrorism --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but if a building blows up remember Oklahoma city the federal building blew up a couple of years ago?
L:  The [inaudible] yeah.
R:  Yeah who do you -- if that happens today who do you think is behind it?  What's your first thought?
L:  Who the first person that I'd think was behind?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Probably, um, somebody like Bin Laden.
R:  That's exactly what I think and instead it's those idiot white guys you know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So you know we can't -- you know you also can't -- you know you have got to be innocent until proven guilty you know what I mean?  And I feel sorry for Arab Americans especially --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- who you know people are staring at them and looking at them and wondering you know are they up to no good and you know just that's really terrible, it's very unfortunate because a lot of those people are just good decent people who are just trying to live just the same as everybody else.
L:  That's true and you know you brought up a good point because actually it was just like remember the aeroplane when a man took off his shoe [inaudible] explosive thing in it?
R:  Yep.
L:  Well see if something happened like that um -- a man took off his shoe where I live at, um, coming from Washington DC when, um, on the subway and he was white.
