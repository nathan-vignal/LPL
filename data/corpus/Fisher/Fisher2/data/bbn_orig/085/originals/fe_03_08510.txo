L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Cassandra.
R:  Hi, this is Rachel -- how are you?
L:  Good, how are you?
R:  Great, um --
L:  [inaudible]
R:  -- I really know nothing about the topic they gave us, 'cause I'm not really into sports -- do you know about it?
L:  Um, all I know about it is that athletes get paid a whole heck of a lot more than I do.
R:  Yeah.
L:  To -- to play games, and supposedly be role models, um --
R:  Yeah, but it's not really.
L:  -- right, which they're not really, and then they have the n- -- I don't know, I -- I -- I have opinions on the subject, I guess -- I don't like that, you know, they go on strike because they want more money --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- than what they already get paid, I mean, it's one thing, when grocery workers or teachers go on strike 'cause they do --
R:  Work hard.
L:  -- deserve it -- right, well, I mean, athletes work hard too, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- teachers, and grocery people or whatever, they perform a service that we sort of need --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know?  And, they don't get paid a lot of money for it, and athletes -- they do what they love -- they play a sport, they get paid ridiculous amounts of money, especially the male athletes -- the women athletes don't get paid anywhere near as much, and I think they just --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sorta like, they're rather self important.
R:  Yeah, I think it -- it's -- that's the same issue with actors, you know, the women don't get paid as much as the men, and everything, and -- they don't strike for more benefits, and they makes lots and everything.
L:  Right, well, I don't -- I can't think of a time I heard about -- I mean, an actor will just like, turn down a movie if they want more money or whatever, but, like, that doesn't hold up -- they're -- you're not like half way through the movie, and the actor's like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- "That's it -- I want another two and a half million dollars --"
R:  Yeah, duh.  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- or, I'm not gonna finish the movie" -- they'd be retarded, but, you know, like, in sports it'll be half way through the season and --
R:  And they'll be like, "I'll stop playing". [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, and I guess, like, their -- all their contracts seem to be at different times, like, there's not, like, [MN] I mean, I -- I don't -- I don't know a whole lot about sports, but I remember, like, back in the day with baseball there was spring training and they'd go to the colleges whatever time, and pick people and whatever, but if --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- if there's a season, how come people's contracts are always ending like, in the middle of the season?  I don't understand that.
R:  Probably because they have a publicist, who's like making them --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- ask for more, and they listen to what their publicist says, and that's why they do it -- because they -- they've got people, you know, each athlete, they've got a manager, they've got a publicist, they've got people working for them, and those people are, like, you know what?  I want a bigger cut, so, you have to ask for more money, or else you have to stop playing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and they know that the team people will give it to them --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, 'cause -- if they're giving the team publicity, if they're the best player, they're not gonna throw 'em off the team half way through the season and it's all a big circle, so ...
L:  Ah, see, but I think they should -- I think they need to make an example out of Shaquille O'Neil, or whoever the heck is big these days, and be like, "Oh, really?  You want another eight million dollars?  Why don't you go ask for eight million dollars at the grocery store".
R:  Yeah, and it's like --
L:  "Bye."
R:  -- you know, like, Shaquille [inaudible] knows he can do that, because if they win, like, some championship or something, because of his skills, the team gets paid -- like, the person who keeps him on gets paid, like, fifty million dollars --
L:  I know.
R:  -- like, they get prize money, it's ridiculous how much money, like, they get -- that's why they keep people on, you know?
L:  Nobody in that industry has the guts, or the -- the desire to make an examp- -- if they did that -- if they did that with just one big name person, and said -- do you know -- if, like, all the sports got together and blacklisted that -- all -- not all the sports --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but all the teams got together and they're like, "All right guys, we gotta take one for the team, we gotta --"
R:  Yes.
L:  "-- make an example out of one person, and we all have to decide behind closed doors that --"
R:  Yeah.
L:  "-- we're just not gonna give this person money" --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and make an example, and they said, "We'll give you this much" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- "We will ...", you know what I mean?  Like, "We'll give you the --"
R:  Yeah, it's never gonna happen, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  No, it's not [several inaudible words].
R:  'Cause everybody's money hungry, and everyone working for them is money hungry, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's a vicious circle, and everything.
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
R:  Very good point you have, though -- I agree with you.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think it's stupid, I think that normal people like us should be getting paid insane amounts of money for not doing much or whatever.
L:  Well -- well, at least, if you're gonna, you know, pay all that -- it's like, every time they raise somebody's salary another coupla million dollars, the ticket prices at the stadium, or wherever --
R:  Go up.
L:  -- go up.  You know, and then we have to pay for it, because somebody's so frigging greedy.
R:  Yeah, and they could use it on something -- something useful, you know, you feel that you've got so many millions of dollars and then you don't know what to do with it -- you can only have, like, so big of a house for one person, you know?  And --
L:  I know, like there should be --
R:  -- so many places you can go.
L:  -- [LAUGH] there should be a getting a lot of money for a stupid reason tax, and, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?  Like, I --I --
R:  Yeah, and you know what else -- they all -- people like that, they make themselves, like, a business --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like, they make themselves an incorporated, so they can claim everything and they don't pay tax.
L:  Right.
R:  [several inaudible words] making millions of dollars and they're --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- writing everything off, it's --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- you know.
L:  I don't know -- I think it's one thing if you create, um, something that people want, and then purchase it, like, you know, I -- I -- I -- I, like, most people, have mixed feelings about Bill Gates and Microsoft, I think he's as much, you know, a blessing as he is the devil, but --
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, at the same time, like, he went out there, he created something, he made his niche, and -- and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah --
R:  It's like, he's just a monopoly now, that's [inaudible] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, he wants everything.
L:  But, he got where he is because of business skills, and -- and whatever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you got people that -- yes, you have a really great talent at basketball, or baseball, or whatever, and yes, you deserve to have a very comfortable life because of it, because you're the person who's doing that, or whatever, but, like, if you're gonna cause me to have to pay ridiculously more --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- money to see you doing what you wanna be doing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- then, you have to pay for, you know, baseball training in schools or something, you know what I mean?  Like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you just -- I don't know.
R:  Something productive, yeah [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [SIGH] And, also, you know, I think they'll lose fans if they keep asking for more money and the prices have to go up -- a lot of their fans, I mean, I know a lot of sports fans probably come from more underprivileged areas, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- won't go to the games anymore.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, then all the owners will have to lower the salaries, because nobody's coming to see them.
L:  Well, sports fans are --
R:  But, like, that's the only way they're gonna learn.
L:  Yeah.  The sports fans that I've spoken to are so haphazardly particular, like, you know, if you grew up in Boston, you have to be a Boston whatever [inaudible] or whatever --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH].
L:  -- you go to Fenwick[?] Park, in Fenwick or whatever, you know?  Like, that's it -- that's how they do it -- I, ah -- I was just reading, um, an email from a guy the other day who said he grew up in Chicago and the only reason he took -- whatever, the White Socks over the Cubs, or whoever the two teams are in Chicago, was 'cause everybody in his neighborhood seemed to be going for the one team -- all of a sudden one day when he was a kid, 'cause it was the thing to do, and he said, "To heck with that bandwagon, I'm gonna go for the other team, just 'cause", and he's been a diehard fan of that team his whole life, and now, when -- I don't know if it was Sammy [inaudible], or somebody who was on the team that he's been a fan of forever, wanted more money, wasn't gonna get more money and there was some issue where the guy just, like, gave the heck for the last half of the season, and he didn't play well at all, and he was just, like, to hell with it, 'cause he knew he was getting traded at the end of the season --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and he got traded to the other Chicago team, and now he's playing really well, and doing all the, you know, whatever the heck you do in baseball --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and, so, this guy was saying, that now he hates that team even more, because the guy was intentionally not doing his best --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause he wanted, you know what I mean?  
R:  [inaudible] money, yeah.
L:  That's really -- but, that's -- aside from the fact that whoever that player was, that, is ridiculous and greedy, you know, needs to be kicked out of baseball for that -- that fan is a prime example of the fans -- they will get insulted because they are mostly working class, and they'll be like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, it's one thing if you want money, fine, but don't, you know, piss me off, 'cause that's ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, and then you'll lose out [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is stupid though -- I've heard of stuff like that, but that is really stupid, 'cause it -- you know, you're on a team -- you're on a team, you do your work --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and then you get traded at the end -- you don't do crappy work.
L:  Exactly, if I don't like the way my company is, you know, doing this customer service policy one day, I don't just go to work and say, "Okay, well I'm not gonna give a hundred percent --"
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  "-- today, because --"
R:  Because the boss didn't do something my way.
L:  -- you know, or, "My stock went down, so I'm only gonna give eight five percent today, but if my stock goes back up tomorrow, then I'll give, you know, ninety two".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Good for it.
L:  Okay, thank you [several inaudible words] --
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't --I don't get it.
R:  I don't either.
L:  I don't get it.
R:  I don't have any more opinions [LAUGH].
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I just think it's crazy -- so where are you from?
L:  Ah, New York.
R:  Oh, me too.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  I'm from New Jersey -- I work in the city, so [LAUGH] ... 
L:  I'm in the city.  
R:  Everyone I talk to on this is from New York. 
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  -- it's probably just the time of day though, we get to call.
L:  Yeah, that's probably true.
R:  [inaudible] [MN] It's funny though -- I don't know -- I wish I was making as much money as those people.
L:  Oh, tell me about it.
R:  I'd be so free -- I'd have like a huge house and [LAUGH] --
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  -- lots of other useless shit that they buy.
L:  Only have to work, like, a third of the year.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  That would be nice.
R:  I know [LIPSMACK] -- I don't think any, ah, [inaudible] are gonna come around though --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- any time soon.
L:  They're always just gonna go for their publicity, and ...
