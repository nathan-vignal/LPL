L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name is Jessica.
L:  I'm Carey.
R:  Carey?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Hi, um, I guess we're supposed to talk about airport security and -- and things like that.
L:  Okay, sure.
R:  Um, so do you think they're doing a good job?
L:  Um, do I think they're doing a good job?  Um, I think they are doing a pretty -- pretty decent job, they're pretty thorough.
R:  Yeah.
L:  However, um, I'm not sure the cost of, ah, going through all those procedures is necessarily worth, um, worth it.  I don't know, I think that if someone wanted to do something terrible, I think it could be done bypassing all this common security.
R:  Mhm, yeah, you're -- you're probably right but I think it's good to have security, you know, I think that, you know, um, it's better to have all that security than -- than not have any at all, you know, because, you know, maybe, you know, they have -- they are preventing things that could have happened, you know, that somebody, you know, and with the security, then they prevented something, you know, maybe pretty bad.  So I think, um --
L:  Right.
R:  You know, I think it's good to have airport security, you know, pretty tight, you know.  But, ah, there's this controversy about, you know, Southwest Airlines.  Have you heard that, that they're -- they're cutting down on the -- on the illegal Mexicans and things like that?
L:  I haven't heard about that.  What's that about?
R:  Yeah.  Well, it's in California; where are you from?
L:  I'm from Chicago.
R:  Oh, Chicago, okay, it's in California, Southwest Airlines.  They're -- they're checking all the- their, um, their, um, passengers to see if they're legal or not legal and then -- then they're calling Immigration on them.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  You know, if they're not legal, if they are travelling through the coun- -- you know, if they're travelling in this country to another place.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, so that's a big controversy out here, is, you know, um, are they, you know, should they do that or, you know, because [COUGH], you know, any of the other airlines I don't think do that, don't check, you know, for your -- for your residency, but, you know, Southwest Airlines is getting a lot of shaft because they were doing that.  You know, but I think, you know, I think it's good that they do because, you know, there's a lo- -- we have a problem with a lot of illegal aliens here, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's getting worse and worse and worse, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And especially, you know, like, um, you know, the women come here to have their babies because they know that, um --
L:  They can become citizens that way.
R:  Yeah, you know, that, ah, they can ha- -- they can get welfare and everything like that without working and stuff, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's a big problem but, um, I think that, you know, that, ah, I think that we're doing a pretty good job too because, you know, there haven't been any more terrorist attacks, so I think that's an indication of something, isn't it?
L:  Yeah, um, --
R:  You know, that's an indication that they're -- they're on -- they're kind of on top of it, right?
L:  Yeah, they're on the right track.  I think that, um, you know, ever since, ah, September eleventh they, ah, --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- obviously beefed up security incredible amount.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I mean, I'm -- I'm not sure how easy it would be or how plausible it would be for someone to actually do this kind of thing again, especially in those couple of months after when the guy tried it with the shoe bomb.
R:  Yeah, uh-huh.
L:  Now -- now they're checking all the shoes which I guess is --
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE]
L:  -- Um, I don't know, I guess maybe that, ah, --
R:  Yeah, you think we'll get a little paranoid, you know, like a little more, you know, just a little paranoid just too much, you know, you think it's just too much or, um?
L:  Um, I think in some cases they might be going a little overboard.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I know that --
L:  I'd rather -- yeah, go ahead.
R:  I know that -- I know like they -- they -- they take razors and things like that, you know [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  You know, things that are, you know, like nail clippers or, you know, they confiscate those kind of things and that's kind of, ah, I don't know, you know.  I mean, if you really wanted a weapon, I guess the plastic forks they give you for the, you know, the in flight meal, you know, you could use that as a weapon, you know [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  So I don't know, I -- I think that's a little ridiculous, you know.
L:  Yeah. I remember I --
R:  Nail clippers and razors.
L:  -- I flew to Florida last year and they --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  They confiscated my nail clippers back --
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] How did you feel about that?
L:  Um, I don't know.  I guess if they're willing to go to that, you know.
R:  Yeah, that far.
L:  Willing to go like that, I guess it's worth it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, I would rather have --
R:  You said the cost wasn't worth it, you mean the cost for extra security or the cost for the passengers or what -- what did you mean by the cost?  I didn't -- I didn't understand what you meant by the cost.
L:  Um, I guess the cost of --
R:  Having more police, um.
L:  Yeah, the police and time is also a cost.
R:  Yeah, yeah, that's true, you know.
L:  But I don't know, I guess if they want to -- I'd rather have them go overboard than underboard, you know.
R:  Yeah, me too.  That's what I was going to say.  I was going to say, you know, even though it is a hassle, you know, we are -- we are, you know, hated by a lot of people, you know, [LAUGH] and it's just like, um, you know, it's better to be -- have that extra precaution than -- than -- than not enough, you know.
L:  Definitely true.
R:  Because I'd hate to be on a flight that -- where they -- where they didn't have that protection, you know, I'd hate to be on that flight, you know, maybe something might happen, you know, the same thing like nine eleven, you know.  So I think, you know, the security is good.  Um, um, --
L:  [inaudible] ah.
R:  What else can I say?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. [MN]
R:  Um.
L:  I think, um, I don't know, maybe they learned something that these -- that these airline, ah, these airlines have for were, you know, I mean, obviously their first objective is to maintain safety in their first.
R:  Right.
L:  However, you know, ever since September eleventh, the economy has been going down, especially with the airlines who have gotten hit hard.
R:  Yeah, they have, uh-huh.
L:  I think this is a way for them to kind of, ah, you know, show the people that they are -- that the airlines are actually safe in order to, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- inject some type of --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- money into -- into their economy because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they're -- they're the ones that are going to lose out if they don't do their job right. I mean --
R:  Yeah, 'cause I think American Airlines is like closed down, didn't it, or it's going bankrupt or something like that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, yeah.  Yeah, um, also what do you think about -- about them, um, sealing the captain's, um -- I heard about where they -- they have a lock where, you know, the captain only has a key to the -- to the cockpit, you know, where -- where nobody -- nobody can get through to the cockpit, you know, so they can't, they had like a steel, like a big steel door, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  They are put- -- they are putting the big steel doors on the -- on the entrance to the cock, you know, pit so that they can't have access to the -- to the, um, um, [COUGH] to the, um, -- what do they call them, the drivers, you know.
L:  Oh, the pilots.
R:  Pilot, yeah, pilot [LAUGH] yeah, that's right.  So you think that's a good idea?
L:  Um, that I -- I -- I've heard of it and I heard that's incredibly expensive.
R:  Really?  Is it -- is it really expensive?  I didn't know.  I haven't, you know, I haven't heard that but, you know, I thought, you know, that's kind of -- kind of like a big security measure, you know.
L:  That's -- that's huge, that's --
R:  Yeah.  Because, you know, but I think, you know, I mean, I don't know -- for me I think it would be worth the expense because if they can't get into the cockpit, then they can't, you know, they can't overthrow the airplane, you know.
L:  That's true but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they could still, if they want to, um, you know, if they want to do what happened to that flight in Pennsylvania on September eleventh, they could just take you down anyway.  They could somehow, ah, you know, cause some disruption in the cabin pressure, something with the air and then make the plane go down without even --
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Having contact with the, ah, pilot.
R:  So they wouldn't even -- so that would be a, oh, I see, okay.
L:  I mean, obviously it makes them much more safer [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Protection [inaudible]
R:  I didn't know they could do that with the pressure and all that kind of stuff.  That -- that I didn't know so.
L:  I'm sure they could somehow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I honestly don't know.  Um, --
R:  Yeah, I think I've only ridden in a plane like one -- once or twice, you know [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah, I'm scared of airplanes [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have you flew since September eleventh?
R:  Um, no, uh-oh.  I did it before, this is like in nineteen eighty -- in nineteen -- no, nineteen ninety five, um, I went to see my brother.  He lives in Chicago.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, and, um, I was -- and then I came back and, it was kind of scary.  I was holding my breath and praying all the way, you know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Really?
R:        But, um, that was before, but -- but still, you know, it's still scary, you know.
L:  Yeah, it is very scary.
R:  I don't think -- I don't think -- I don't know.  For me I don't think I would.  I would -- if I had a choice on an airplane right now or a bus, I think I'd prefer the bus.
L:  Really?
R:  You know, I don't know, I think I just -- I'm still a little sceptical about their, you know, security measures and being in a plane and, you know, knowing what they can do with it now, you know, knowing how they could, you know, destroy a lot of, um, you know, people -- kill a lot of people like that, you know, with one airplane, you know, it's, you know, I think I'd rather take -- I think I'd be safer on ground, you know [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, have you taken a plane since?
L:  I have, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I was a little worried directly after, maybe even a couple of months after.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But since then I've been on a plane, ah, a couple of times.  I think that maybe in a sense that post nine eleven --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the security is obviously much, you know, much more upgraded.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And there's times I think it might even be safer to fly now than it was before then just --
R:  You think so, yeah.
L:  I think -- I think it might be actually.
R:  Yeah, wow, yeah, because I don't know, I still just, you know, just have that -- I mean, nine eleven is something -- it was something so tragic that you just can't forget.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, I mean, that's something that stays with you like, you know, for a long time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, you think about the risk and everything like that and then, you know, it's really something -- it's really something hard to -- hard to deal with, you know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, but, ah, you know, I hope they're doing their job, you know, but, you know, I -- I heard a report that says that they're like -- they're like, um, people have passed, you know, have gotten through with guns and -- and, you know, knives and things like that, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, so I -- I, you know, I really don't know, I don't know.
