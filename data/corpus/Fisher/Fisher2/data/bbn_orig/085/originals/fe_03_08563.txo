R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, [LAUGH] my name is Brandon.
R:  Hi, my name is Anis.
L:  Okay, um, well -- [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  The question was, um, higher security.
R:  Yes.
L:  Ah, well, I guess -- I guess I'll start, I guess.  Um, I kind of don't think so.  Um, I think any ef- -- any efforts you put forth are good but anyone can get around it.
R:  Mm.
L:  So I -- I think definitely never foolproof so I think anything can be intercepted.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So.
R:  Well, I agree.  I think if anybody wants to they could get around it.  But I think the fact that it's there is definitely better, you know, than -- than it not being there at all.  I think it might -- it does something.
L:  Well, yeah, but also, like, you have to think about the cost, like, are people going to still -- like, if you use higher security --
R:  Mhm.
L:  That means the money has to come from somewhere, right?
R:  Right.
L:  And so I would think it would have had to come from, of course, the people who use it or tickets and driving up the cost so much would make people want to take planes any more.
R:  Well, how else do people get around if they really need to go somewhere that's further away than trains, bus?
L:  Well, yeah, I'm -- I'm a college student so --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Oh, you too?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So like, you know, like I -- I -- I got to get home and back, [LAUGH] you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  At least three times during the school year.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that's pretty expensive, especially since I live so far away so --
R:  So do you feel safer now, that -- that airport security is higher or not really?
L:  [SIGH] Not really.  I mean, I guess I'm -- I'm -- I'm of the mentality that I'm not ever really scared so much like if, like, anything will kill you.
R:  Yes, I agree.
L:  Is pretty much where I am like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, you could be killed on the highway.  You have a -- you have a greater chance of being killed, um, driving than you do flying, and for instance, anything will kill you.  You can't live your life scared and so if it happens to you, then, you know, it's -- it's -- it's not a good thing, and, you know, it -- it -- but it happens.
R:  Yeah.  No, I agree with that, but I think if you are in a car and you get into an accident, you have more of a chance of surviving than if you're on a plane, you know, if you go down, that's it, you go down. There's no survivors.
L:  That's tr- -- I guess that's true but I don't know, is -- is the chance of you actually, um, dying from a plane greater than you actually getting -- dying from a car?
R:  No, no, I guess not.
L:  I -- I honestly.
R:  Like for me, I -- I take -- I get home, I live pretty close to campus.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I usually just drive home or somebody comes to pick me up or I take the train.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But I'm going to go study abroad this coming semester so I have to fly over to London and then take planes there, you know, from -- if I go to travel, let's say to France or somewhere, but flying over there, I feel a little bit more safe like knowing that there's more security.  I don't know if I would have went immediately after nine eleven.
L:  Yeah, that was -- that -- I don't -- I don't either.  I was -- I guess I was kind of shaken up but I got over it pretty quickly, you know.  I -- I don't know.  It -- but also like, what -- what is neces- -- what necessary does high end security entail?  What does that mean?  Like --
R:  Well, I think the fact that they -- they're like picking out let's say somebod- -- a Moslem man.  I had a professor and he was Moslem and he was telling us how he actually flew, I think -- I don't remember exactly where he was from, but he flew home.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And they just picked him out of the crowd simply because he was Moslem and -- and you could tell that he was.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And he said that was really unfair.  He is a professor, a PhD, and so he was completely like, you know, "Oh, yeah, I'm carrying a bomb in my -- in my suitcase, you know, right next to my class test" or something like and it was totally ridiculous but he said that he understood and he wasn't completely too angry and he was willing to do it for the -- for the greater good.
L:  Well, just as long as you're -- they're not treating, you know.  I guess [COUGH] there is some type of profile.  I know -- I know nothing -- I just agree with that because I honestly think that the people -- these people aren't stupid and that they can -- disguise -- disdise- disguise themselves really well and, um, that they all aren't necessarily my -- that's just -- that's just what I think that I think that they can pick people out, they can pick even Europeans out.
R:  Yeah, of course.
L:  Send 'em to America and have 'em blend in with the -- with a crowd and they can be just the biggest -- a big of a terrorist than any Moslem can be.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  So -- I -- I don't really know about that.  I -- I -- I am also aware about what high end security, does that mean there are more, what, guards, or what -- what -- what exactly does that mean?  Are they better trained?  If they are better trained, I guess fine, I don't know.
R:  They should be I suppose.
L:  What, you know.  I -- I -- I personally don't know.
R:  I think racial profiling, I don't think picking out random people from a crowd just because they are of a certain race or religion, I don't think that's really going to do much, but I think metal detectors and checking bags, that might accomplish something.
L:  Yeah, like, racial profile is not a good thing, you know, it's kind of --
R:  No, I don't think it's going to really accomplish.
L:  Something that's coming close to me since I am a black male and, like, you know, it's -- that's why -- that's why I get wary about like you know, people -- just he got picked out just because he was Moslem.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, you know, there are a lot of black Moslems and a lot of 'em might possibly -- they don't stand out, a lot of 'em might possibly have the same [inaudible] ideas as -- as their brothers across the ocean, so, you know, it -- they -- and -- and, you know, people will be definitely be wrong to say, okay, that's a black guy, pick him out, and actually look through his stuff and, um, he -- he might carry a bomb because that's just -- that's not going -- that's not going to fly.
R:  Yeah, I don't think that's going to accomplish anything at all.
L:  So -- I -- I just don't know.  I -- I would guess metal detectors and I guess the random select, you know, how they -- when you get to the airport, they randomly pick you out and, you know, check your bags.  I guess that keeps people on their toes, like makes them think twice.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, like I said like there's only so much you can probably do, I don't know.
R:  I had a friend of mine, my roommate actually.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she was from Georgia, um, I live in Philadelphia.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  She would al- -- take the, you know, she'd fly to Philadelphia and back to Georgia, and her dad would come to visit her and she told me a story that her dad came one time and he had packing tape in his suitcase, just, you know, to pack up her boxes to go home.
L:  Right.
R:  And they took out the packing tape and they told him that he's not allowed to have it, so --
L:  Wow.
R:  And he was kind of like wow, what is he going to do with the packing tape?
L:  Packing tape.
R:  [LAUGH] You know, like tape somebody to death [LAUGH] and so I think that's kind of ridiculous.  That's taking it too far.
L:  We- --
R:  But I -- I mean, if they search my bag, I have no problem with that.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I understand.
L:  I -- I -- agree, I don't have anything, you know, that really no-one should -- should not see, but --
R:  Yeah [LAUGH]
L:  You know, that -- that's -- that's my point, like what is high, is that technically high in security idea?
R:  That's ridiculous in security.
L:  So, yeah, well being so cautious because like some people I know, but some people get, um, gotten pulled out and then they can't clar- carry clippers, toenail clippers on, because they, um, to their baggage.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  But is that high in security?
R:  No, that's just wrong, that's pretty ridiculous.
L:  And he draws that line.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I -- I -- I don't know.
R:  I agree with you.  If people want to hide something, they can definitely find a way, but --
L:  You can find, I mean, you can -- you can hide it on your person, I mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Some -- some way.  It doesn't have to be necessarily metal as to cause damage, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It can -- just like the guy who actually, um, he had a bomb in his shoe or something.
R:  Yeah, I was just thinking that too.
L:  Yeah, so, you know.
R:  A bomb or whatever.
L:  So definitely very fast that's putting that stuff, but, you know.
R:  Have you gone through airports since?
L:  Um, I [inaudible] somewhere to the airport.  Um, I guess it was Christmas, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Ah, because I actually live, I -- I go to school in Chicago, I live in Memphis so --
R:  Okay.
L:  So, um, yeah, I didn't come back from Swinburg[?] so, yeah, it was, um, Christmas and, um, yeah, it wasn't -- it really wasn't that bad.  I mean, it --
R:  Did you -- was it a noticeable change?  Like, were you waiting in line longer or anything?
L:  [SIGH] Mm, not re- -- and this was in O'Hare, so not really I don't think.
R:  Mm.
L:  It really wasn't that bad.  Initially when, um, like right after, um, nine eleven, um, and I came back for Christmas after that, then it was pretty lengthy, it was long, but now I think they've kind of eased up or something or it might -- maybe it became more efficient.  Um, the only thing they did was make sure we stood in line and, um, they ran, um, you went through a metal -- metal detector and they slid your bags through and that's pretty much it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I mean, I -- I think they made it a little more streamlined and I think that's pretty much all you can really do.  You can't -- 'cause you can't really invade anyone's --
R:  Right.
L:  -- privacy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  By actually, you know, go- -- like, shrip- strip -- strip searching them or anything like that.
R:  No, you can't do that.
L:  So that's pretty much it.  So -- I -- I, yeah, it's -- it's fine now, but one more, was high in, [LAUGH] that's what -- that's what I really want to know.
R:  What exactly do they mean?  I guess more guards, more metal detectors.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, that -- that would be my definition I think it's a good idea.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Because ob- obviously we needed it.  Hop- -- maybe if it was there, you know, at least one or two of the people would have been caught during nine eleven, but then you never know, they could have gotten through and no problem.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's just you never know.
L:  Yeah, that's true.  I'm actually curious, are you -- you're in school, right?
R:  I'm a what?
L:  You're in school, right?
R:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm going to be a junior.
L:  You're going to be a junior, okay.  I'm actually going to be a senior, so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I'm just kind of curious, like I want- -- like I wanted to know who actually I'm talking to.
R:  Yeah, that's okay.  Is -- is this your first call or no?
L:  This is my first call.
R:  Yeah, me too, me too.
L:  [LAUGH] it's kind of interesting.  Someone told me, um, about it at school and I decided to sign up and everything.
R:  Oh, that's cool.  It's interesting, I wonder what they are going to do with the data.
L:  I -- I -- I have no idea.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Pretty interesting, so do you go, um, where do you go actually?
R:  I go to Penn so --
L:  Oh, you go to Penn, okay.
R:  Yeah, that's how I heard about it.
L:  Right, I go to North Western so --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  How is -- how is it up there?
R:  It's nice, it's pretty good, I like it.  It's kind of -- you get a -- you get a feel of the city life and it's a little bit more kind of suburban.  The campus is more secluded.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But it's nice, it's pretty good.
L:  Oh, actually I knew -- I knew some- -- I met someone, um, who went there.  She liked it a lot, so, but yeah
