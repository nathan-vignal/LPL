L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, my name's Jeffery.
R:  My name is Charlotte, hi.
L:  Good afternoon.
R:  Good afternoon.  I'm from Philadelphia.
L:  So am I.
R:  How about that?
L:  Well, I presently don't live in Philly but I am a native.
R:  Okay.
L:  Right.
R:  Now the subject is terr- -- uh, security -- no, wait ...
L:  Airport security?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Well, recently I went on a flight, right after nine eleven.
R:  Okay.
L:  I'm happy that we have air marshals and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- people who will protect us from terrorists.
R:  Right.
L:  They checked my boots, uh --
R:  Did you have to take -- did you have to take your shoes off?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, you gotta to be -- man.
L:  They check you at random.  It don't matter if you're a businessman or a regular joe --
R:  Right.
L:  -- or if you're a woman --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uh, nicely dressed --
R:  Right.
L:  -- doesn't matter. 
R:  Wow.
L:  They're checking people and now they want people to volunteer to take off their shoes so this way --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- things can move more speedier, you know, faster.
R:  Right, wow.
L:  So I can appreciate that 'cause it's a drag waiting in line while everyone's being searched.
R:  I know.  It take -- it takes longer -- it takes longer that way on -- on a air -- you know.
L:  Yeah, well they're -- they're trying to tell people now quicker ways, travel light, don't have all these bags, you know.
R:  I know.  They should --
L:  And carry ons, they're very -- 
R:  They should --
L:  They're limited on the carry ons, too.
R:  They should limit the carry -- well, I thought it was only one carry on.  Are you allowed to have more?  No.
L:  Just one.
R:  Well, um --
L:  And they're even taking tweezers from you, if you have them.
R:  Uh --
L:  Even a miniature screwdriver.
R:  I know and also, um, a little penknife.
L:  Yeah, well a pen -- knives are out, period [LAUGH] but --
R:  I know but --
L:  -- when they go for those tweezers --
R:  Tweezers, oh for heav- --
L:  You know, tweezers and screw --
R:  And little cuticle scissors.
L:  Yes.
R:  You can't -- ladies can't take them.
L:  No, forget about scissors.
R:  Unless you put them in your pocket.  No, that won't work.
L:  Even a toenail clip.
R:  No, they won't, no.  So what do you -- oh [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Unless you put them in your pocketbook.
L:  I don't know about that 'cause once you go through the X ray machine they may take it from you.
R:  But that's in your pocketbook.  I guess -- I don't know.
L:  Well, it may alert a metal detector --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when you go through.
R:  Right.
L:  See, a metal detector, you know, it's going to buzz or whatever.
R:  Well --
L:  So, I'm -- I'm just happy that I feel secure --
R:  Right.
L:  -- when I go through and I feel very good when I'm on the plane --
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  -- taking off [LAUGH].
R:  I know but there's more security on planes and, you know, and yet, you know --
L:  And that's one thing, I want the security to be -- I heard some horrible stories about air marshals.
R:  Oh, god.
L:  Poorly trained, panicked --
R:  I know.
L:  -- not actually going by facts, just going by the look of an individual 'cause they have a descent  -- of Middle Eastern descent or whatever.
R:  No, you can't do that.
L:  And I've heard of some stories and now I hear the government -- some -- some of them are being sued for their behavior.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  But it does take longer when you go on a flight now, oh gracious, yes.
L:  It takes longer but they're trying to improve the conditions by telling everyone to travel light and take off your shoes voluntarily [LAUGH].
R:  Well, if you don't take off your shoes, what do you --
L:  They take -- pull you to the side --
R:  Well, see --
L:  -- and smell your shoe.
R:  -- the reason the person won't take off their shoes because there's something in their shoes.
L:  Right.
R:  That's why they won't take 'em off but --
L:  Well, like for instance, they wanted to check my boots.  I didn't give a hoot whether they want to [LAUGH] check 'em or not, I was obliged, I was on my way to Florida on my vacation, "Sure you can check 'em", I have -- you know, I don't fit the profile I don't think but --
R:  Oh, man.
L:  -- they have to check, "Do your job, go right ahead".  They pull you to the side, make you feel kinda --
R:  Oh, dear.
L:  -- you know, uh, whatever.  They don't make me feel anything but, you know, they pull you over and tell you --
R:  Because you can put some -- you can put something in the boot.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  You can put a explosive in the boot --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- which is insane.
R:  You could have something in your suitcase, too, for that matter.
L:  Yeah, that's right.  They try to check everything, much as they can.  They're trying to improve --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause they've been tested several times and the tests have shown that they're not good enough.
R:  [LIPSMACK] I went to Washington on a bus and they wouldn't let us take our pocketbooks into this place where we went in.  We had to leave the pocketbooks on the bus.
L:  No pocketbooks, uh?
R:  No pocketbooks, no key chains --
L:  Yeah, they were --
R:  -- no money.  Oh come on now, no money.
L:  They didn't want --
R:  Everything was locked on the bus, no change purse, nothing.
L:  They're taking it to a whole new level now.
R:  That's ridic- -- --
L:  But I'm happy that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- least they're very conscious --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and making a effort to --
R:  They even checked a lady's pocketbook. [LAUGH]
L:  -- curb all the terrorism --
R:  I know.
L:  -- 'cause I don't want -- I don't want to be --
R:  [MN]
L:  I don't want anyone to be a victim --
R:  I know but it's awful.
L:  -- like that terrible nine eleven situation, that was awful.
R:  Oh man, that was horrible.
L:  Pretty bad, nine o'clock in the morning, you got a plane going through your window, your door of your office.
R:  Yeah, come on now.
L:  That's outrageous [LAUGH].
R:  Uh-huh, man.
L:  I feel bad for those people.
R:  And it was terrorists.
L:  Absolutely.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Saudi Arabia people.
R:  I wonder they're going do with them, dear [inaudible].
L:  Mm?
R:  Nothing.
L:  There's nothing you can do with them 'cause they all friends of people round the world [LAUGH].
R:  I know.
L:  It's unbelievable, it's terrible.  I would just -- at least our immigration department and -- and all the people who work there are being more serious about deporting --
R:  I know.
L:  -- people so that's all you can do.
R:  Right.
L:  Reach out --
R:  But the -- I think they should have the tight security and I st- -- I still think they should do it.  They do it --
L:  Security has to be tighter.
R:  Yep, well --
L:  I -- well -- I -- I --
R:  -- on the airplanes it's tighter but not on the buses and the trains --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't think.
L:  No, the buses or the trains are not, they're not [LAUGH] tighter, no way.
R:  No, I mean --
L:  They're not.  Uh, they could go after that but I don't know, uh --
R:  I don't know how they would do it, how they would --
L:  Uh .
R:  I just came back from Niagara Falls and they come on the bus with Customs.  All they ask you is just -- just to flash your, uh -- your dr- -- your, you know, driver's -- I mean, anybody can [inaudible] and they asked you where you were born and they walk right by you.
L:  [MN]
R:  They didn't look in the bags or nothing.
L:  They probably were profiling people --
R:  Right.
L:  -- with, uh --
R:  They didn't open no suitcases, they didn't know what we had in our bags.
L:  Did they have a dog?
R:  No.
L:  Ah.
R:  No dog, just came on the bus --
L:  'Cause, uh, I hear now they have, um --
R:  -- asked you where you were born and show your ID --
L:  -- sniffing dogs.
R:  -- and how long you were going to be in Can- -- you know, that's all, no dogs.  Oh, and -- yeah, but the luggage was -- that wouldn't work 'cause the luggage is underneath so what would the dog do?  Your luggage is under the bus.
L:  The dog's supposed to sniff out any bombs.
R:  Yeah, but --
L:  I would hope that [LAUGH] they could, [LAUGH] I hope that they could.
R:  Well do they bring a dog on the plane?
L:  No.
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  They don't bring a dog --
L:  But in some areas they do walk dogs through.
R:  Do they?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, man.
L:  I guess, high -- that's high level security and they would bring a dog through to sniff out the place.
R:  Right, goddamn it.
L:  They only do that when there's very important people.  Uh, all people are important but, you know what I mean.
R:  Is this the first day you're doing this?
L:  Of what?
R:  On this telephone thing?
L:  No.
R:  This is my third one.  I did --
L:  This is number two for me.
R:  No, this is number three.  The first, yesterday was about the baseball strike, uh, and the -- oh, and the first one was your reaction after nine one one, that was the first one I did.
L:  I did, uh --
R:  Did you do nine one one?
L:  Did I do nine one one?
R:  I did that the first time.
L:  Yes, I did.  I did some of it.
R:  Did -- did you do the sports one --
L:  No.
R:  -- the baseball strike?
L:  I did not do the sports one.
R:  Okay.  Oh, this is your second one?  You -- all right, you have one more.
L:  Right.  I didn't do the sports one.
R:  No, okay.
L:  [MN] It's neat.  I mean, for ten bucks or whatever, I heard it on the radio so I thought I'd try it.
R:  You do it three times.
L:  The people seem -- yeah, thank you, too.
R:  Okay.
L:  We're all done?
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm still here.
L:  Oh, okay, 'cause normally someone'll come up and say your time's up.
R:  But they didn't come on yet.
L:  No, they did not.
R:  So we still have to talk about this security.  What about --
L:  Well, let's talk.
R:  Well, I'm glad they're doing it and even though it takes longer to get where you have to go they make sure you don't have nothing -- well, I don't think --
L:  Most important.
R:  I don't think they should take cutic- -- I mean, [LAUGH] you do need a nail clipper, I mean, come on now.
L:  You need a nail clipper [LAUGH].
R:  I mean, ladies --
L:  You're going to have to wait on your nails and get 'em pedicured before you take the flight. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, in case you have a -- a broken nail, you want to cut it.
L:  No.
R:  Come on now.
L:  I -- I would say don't [SIGH] --
R:  Don't break your nail.
L:  Don't break your nail and don't -- and file your nails before you get on board.
R:  Right, 'cause they -- they won't --
L:  A lot of people are complaining that, hey, we want security but --
R:  I know but --
L:  -- I don't want to be in the airport for three hours.
R:  No.  So you have --
L:  And I certainly don't want to sit on a -- the -- the tarp.
R:  No.
L:  That's horrible just sitting on a plane, just sitting there.
R:  No.  I think buses are -- well, I don't know if buses are safer during that.
L:  Buses are vulnerable.
R:  Right, but they're not --
L:  They're vulnerable.
R:  Right.
L:  Come on, you're right there, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you can blow up a bus at any time, that's why it happens in Israel all the time.
R:  Right.
L:  You can strap a bomb to anyone's body.
R:  Right.
L:  But, uh, I think that I'm glad that people aren't doing that in this country.
R:  Right.
L:  Thank god for that, that's crazy.
R:  Right.
L:  You have to be very careful today.
R:  Right.
L:  [MN] I think they're looking for huge targets --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things that are very meaningful.
R:  That's what they're definitely looking for.
L:  Stuff that'd make a huge impact.
R:  Right.
L:  They want to hurt the economy --
R:  True.
L:  -- just like what they did with the World Trade, they -- America lost billions of dollars.  They want to hurt, you know --
R:  Right.
L:  They want to really hurt you.
R:  I know.
L:  These people are crazy --
R:  They're nuts. 
L:  -- 'cause of the foreign policies --
R:  Right.
L:  -- of America that are done -- you know, some way slanted.  I guess they're very unhappy about that.
R:  Right, so ...
L:  So, uh, the best --
R:  I -- I agree on the security, they should keep it up and I guess they're going to keep it up.  They're not going to stop it.
L:  Oh yeah.  They're hiring air marshals.
R:  Air marshals.
L:  You had the experience you could be a air marshal.
R:  No, I don't -- what's an air marshal?
L:  That's a security officer who rides the airplanes for --
