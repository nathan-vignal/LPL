L:  Hi how you doing?  My name is Diane.
R:  What's your name?
L:  Diane.
R:  Diane I'm Jay.
L:  Hi Jay how you doing?
R:  Good.
L:  So the topic is do we feel that the --
R:  There could be peace in Middle East I guess.
L:  Yeah personally I don't think so.
R:  I don't think so either.  That goes back the millennium.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Has never been peace in the Middle East.
L:  Well I -- I personally I don't feel that anywhere in the world that man can have true peace.
R:  Right.
L:  Because, um, I don't know do you read our Bible at all?
R:  I haven't recently but I have read it about five times.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  That's great.  Cause, uh, -- in the Bible it talks about how man doesn't even know how to direct his own steps so I don't -- I don't think so.  And --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that the, um, Government officials in the Middle East they're more worried about money and stuff than taking care of the people.
R:  Right.
L:  And then when -- when, um, -- when the US sends over supplies they -- they scoop up the supplies and sometimes the supplies rot somewhere and the people don't even get the help so they -- they truly don't care about the people.
R:  Right.
L:  So no -- yeah I don't -- I don't think that there will ever be peace there.
R:  I don't either.  I don't even think they want peace.
L:  Yeah it's hard to tell because you see -- see how I seen on the news how they seemed happy that like, um, Bin Laden or whoever that statue was taken down but then -- then another --
R:  Saddam Hussain.
L:  Yeah Saddam that's it and then another [inaudible] they hate the Americans that did it who are supposed to be trying to help them to get out of that bad situation then they have people that hate them for doing it.  Yet I -- I'm not sure if they really want it either.
R:  Right.
L:  It's a weird situation over there.
R:  Right.
L:  I don't know it's, uh, --
R:  Everytime we've tried to solve Israel's problems except for [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, we haven't gotten anywhere with them.  Somebody is getting somewhere they kill them.
L:  Yeah.  Or they cut off their hand [LAUGH] or something horrible.
R:  Something horrible yeah.
L:  Yeah -- yeah I don't think that, um, that there, um, -- through line of hierarchy is ever going to be able to do anything because I don't think they truly care about the people and, um, --
R:  [inaudible] state and peace for Israel but he doesn't have any power over [inaudible] or [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  He doesn't have any control of them and so what's the point.  It would be like -- like, um, I don't know a --
L:  How do you feel how they treat their women?
R:  -- President like -- a President that had the complete Congress and the Supreme Court and the other party trying to run the country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  How do you feel about how they treat their women there?
R:  In Israel?
L:  Yeah.  How they have to wear +scarves and --
R:  Well the Jews don't do that do they?
L:  Um, no I don't think so.  I think it is just in the Middle East the Muslims and the [inaudible] or --
R:  Yeah the [inaudible]
L:  How they have to -- their women have to, um, keep their faces covered and they have to wear clothes all the way down so that there is really no skin showing and I've heard of where, um, husbands if they can kill their wives then it doesn't matter to them down there.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  Isn't that mostly in Afghanistan?  Or [inaudible]
L:  I'm not -- I'm not sure exactly --
R:  I'm not sure exactly either about what it is down there [inaudible] or something [inaudible]
L:  And I think Iraq does that too where the women are, um, --
R:  You don't hear about many gender abuses in the [inaudible] hear about it in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan but that's all been rectified.
L:  [inaudible] --
R:  I don't know -- Iran maybe.  Iran you see pictures of the women in black shrouds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I am not sure in Iran.
L:  Yeah.  I know that they're trying to fix some of that but I -- I think they went to court or something -- some kind of thing and it got thrown out still have to wear, um, the +scarves and stuff like that.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  What?
R:  [inaudible] covering things up making things more paranoid for them.
L:  Yeah.
R:  When they try and deal with people of a different, um, sex, that frame of mind comes into it and you get paranoid about everything.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  What you say?
L:  Yeah I --
R:  Can't even let your wife walk down the street.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or dress without covering her face.
L:  Yeah --
R:  And work or go to school it's all a form of ignorance.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And when it comes down to it that effects their minds too.
L:  You said it right there it's a form of ignorance.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But back to [inaudible] they'll never be able to have peace because everybody has to be happy in ordered to have peace.
R:  Right.
L:  So I --
R:  Well who's happy in America?
L:  I don't -- I don't think many people are happy in America either.
R:  Everybody does [inaudible]
L:  Yeah because it's, um, I don't know how your life is but we live from pay cheque to pay cheque and it's just you know not an easy life.
R:  Boring?
L:  Yeah never any time to do anything fun or money to do fun things and --
R:  Right.
L:  And then I have -- I have a brother who makes really really good money, um, and he's not happy, his marriage is falling apart and you know so actually money -- money doesn't make happiness either.
R:  We're a very prosperous nation.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And yet we're unhappy.  Drugs.
L:  We have everything we need here but, um, --
R:  We [inaudible] society for the most part.
L:  Yeah pretty much.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- down town or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah and I -- you know we see commercial on TV for feeding that are hungry in other countries --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but you got hunger here too and the needy here but they -- you're [inaudible] so they want you to send money other places when we could be spending money right here and helping.
R:  Right.
L:  People are in our own country.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Better [inaudible]
R:  You don't have starvation in America.
L:  Well I don't think we have a lot of starvation in America but there -- there's a lot of families or people who they go hungry maybe they're not starving to death but --
R:  Well hunger can go -- you can get used to hunger.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's when you're a life span threatened by thugs or criminals or the government or you don't have freedom of speech, where we can't do anything without the government interfering.  That's what's worse.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hunger you can learn to live with I think but to die [inaudible]
L:  Yeah.
R:  [inaudible] some people have [inaudible]
L:  I -- I don't have a --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  Function over there they can't even -- every time they get on a bus it might be their last bus ride.
R:  Right.
L:  Because it might have one of those bombers -- suicide bombers on the bus.
R:  Right.
L:  No matter where they go it may be the last time they see their family because they may accidentally meet up with the suicide bomber and you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  That must be a horrible way to live fear every day.
R:  What happens -- how many people have been killed in Israel
