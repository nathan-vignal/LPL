R:  Alec.
L:  Hi, my name is Judy.
R:  Yes, Judy, how you doing?
L:  Good, thank you.
R:  All right.  So, what do you think about the things happening in the Middle East?
L:  What do I think about it?  Well, I -- I -- [LAUGH] I think the United States, ah, is not doing what it's supposed to be doing, I -- I don't like this administration and its policies, um, I also don't think that the Palestinians are going to keep their promises, and I think the Israelis eventually are going to be pushed to fight again, because the, uh, -- Hamas will not stop their bombing.  As long as you have the mullahs and the religious leaders pushing them, and people teaching young kids to hate, you can't have peace.
R:  Well, I appreciate your point of view, but the thing, you understand, is, I'm from the Middle East, and I know a better view on what's happening, because I have lived in the Middle East for about -- over twenty years, you know, -- ah, actually, I have lived, you know, -- the current problems, you know, that we have right now, and you know, as long as -- as far as the United States is concerned, you know, I would say, the United States, just, you know, to maintain, you know, the -- the face, I mean, you know, their perspective, or whatever, you know, it's much better for them to pull out, themselves out, of the Middle East, because, you know, right now, they're getting involved in some ways, you know, it's not really helping them, because, you know, yes, I -- I agree with what you said, you know, that peace will never be achieved, okay, because, you know, there is -- there is so many different points, you know, they will never agree on it.  You know, like, l -- like you said, Hamas bombing, you know, for these people, they are not bombing, you know, they are fighting the liberation fight, you know, and it's, you know, it's, like, you said they teach hate to the kids, you know, that is -- that's not how they look at it, they teach them how to -- you know, who their enemy is, and who is -- you know, who is supposed to do, but the thing I don't agree with, y-you know, okay, you want to fight, go ahead, I'll fight the military, you know, but don't, you know -- kids and women and old people have done nothing to you, you know, they're only trying to live in peace, you know, why do you have to bomb restaurants, you know, you want to fight for the freedom, go ahead, fight the army, you know, don't fight civilians, you know, otherwise, other, you know, like, people will never respect your point of view if you kill innocent people.  You know, you can talk, you can negotiate, you can convince the whole world with your point of view, you want to do or you want to say, okay, but, you know, with this kind of action, nobody will even be willing to listen to you, because you're a criminal, you know, you're killing innocent people, you're killing kids, you're killing women, for what?  For -- for reasons we call liberation and all those things, but, the thing is, you know, as long as everybody stick to his own view, you know, and it's not going -- it's not going to work, you know, you -- you will say, "Right", and they insist that it has to be this way, and the other people say, "No, it's left", and they insist to be on this way, okay, you know what, you can't continue disagreeing with each -- wi- with each other for the rest of your life.  You know, that will never achieve any kind of progress, but if you can't compromise, both of you, together, and somehow, and, like, you know, [MN] meet each other in the middle, you know, it will have much better for you and for me and for the next generations thereafter, you know, but [MN] with this current situation, it will never be peace.  And both parties know that.  Both parties know it.
L:  Right, but -- but the thing is that there are more than two parties involved, and I think that the more fingers you get in there, the stickier the situation gets.  I really think that there should be an international group formed, maybe from the UN, maybe from, ah, neutral countries, I'm not sure, and they should go in and they should have a commission and they should sit there and they should study the situation for [MN] a specific period of time, and they should come up with proposals and everyone -- everyone should agree, "We will not raise arms, we will not fight, we will not anything while this is going on, and we will listen to this international party", and I think it should not be the United States, because I think that the United States has dirty hands, and our --
R:  Yeah, [MN] --
L:  -- our -- our interests are not pure.  And I don't think --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- that people will respect anyone whose interests are not pure, as long as -- as we're interested in Middle East oil, we can't go in there and broker a peace agreement, because we're biased, we're looking to protect our interests, and that does not protect the people of the Middle East.  Too many people have died, Arab, Israeli, doesn't make a difference, too many mothers are crying by graves.
R:  That's true, that's really true, I agree with that, but the thing is, you know, now, you know, as it comes, you know, like, for me, when I go, when I go back to the Middle East, I can't say to mo- -- strangers I'm an American, you know, I can't say that, because, you know, basically, they will, like, you know, like, okay, you know -- you know what, you're no longer one of us, you know, because, right now, it's [MN] the Jihad, and you know, being American it's Jihad, being an Israeli as well, you know, because, you know, you see, the thing is, it's the media, it's whole about the media, people believe what they read, people believe what they hear every day, and they keep, like, brainwashing people, you know, "Okay, this is your enemy, whatever, whatever, whatever", okay, and then what?  People hate.  Then what?  You get it up to people, you know, and different, you know, like, there is so many different kind of people, people who are willing to negotiate, people who are willing to talk, and people who are willing to act stupid, you know, --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they just -- they just keep giving them, you know, like, concentrated doses of, you know, news, okay, how many people killed today, how many kids were killed today, whatever, and they don't say, what to do they don't say what to say, they don't say anything, they just let everybody act the way he wants, you know, people will go on demonstrations, people go on, like, drives, whatever, and then what?  Nothing has changed, nothing, no -- no progress has -- has been made.  We've been in this situation for over fifty years, you know, since nineteen forty eight.
L:  Yeah, but don't forget, --
R:  This situation w- -- this situation was going --
L:  -- don't forget there have -- there have been too many colonial powers in there, and everyone, people -- the British still have their -- ah, their issues there, the French still have their issues, all tied in to quote their national honor, that's why I say, we need people -- people like Jimmy Carter -- people like -- people from India, who are known to care only about justice, and justice means, doesn't make a difference what's happened before, doesn't make a difference about oil interests, justice has to be that everyone has a place in this world, and you have to respect that everyone has a place in this world, and you have to -- you cannot keep perpetuating this same thing over and over again.  You need people that can go in there and talk plain commonsense and say, "Look, if you really want peace here, then, you all have to put down your arms now, you have to stop, you have to call a -- a truce, for sixty days or -- or three months or whatever, to show your good faith, and then, we have to sit at a table and figure out how can everyone live here, without killing one another".  I don't care, military or not.  Too many people have died, th- the soil is drenched in blood and this serves no purpose.
R:  Well, you know, it's -- I wish, you know, the real life is as easy as we're talking, but the thing is, you know, we are far away from the action of the field, actually, and we just think my opinion and your opinion, but the thing is, we are not a decision maker, you know, unfortunately, the decision makers, they think differently.  Everybody, I think, you know, and I'm talking about the Arab side, because, me being an Arab, you know, I can --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- see better things, --
L:  Well, I'm a Jew, --
R:  -- you know, at least, if for once, [inaudible].
L:  -- I'm a Jew but you and I are talking, we don't agree about everything but we're talking, and we do agree that people should not be dying, people should not be dying.
R:  Yeah, and -- but the problem -- yeah, but the problem with decision makers, everybody care about his own, everybody care about his political future, nobody care about the real problem, nobody care about, [MN] you know, civilian, and his own people country.
L:  I ag- -- I agree with you one hundred percent but then, it's time for both the Israeli and the, uh, and the -- and the -- and the Pa- -- the Palestinian, -- all the Arab people -- the people, people in the streets, to say, "You know what?  We're tired of burying our children, we're tired of burying our sons, we're tired of burying our fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers, we are tired, we do not want blood on our hands, we do not want the soil drenched with blood, we want to live in peace, we want to live, because we don't get another chance here.  We get one chance in this world".
R:  Yeah.
L:  What are we doing here?
R:  Unfortunately, unfortunately, on, ah -- back in nineteen seventy three, Egypt, where I'm from, we had our peace agreement to Israel, you know, and we had all, you know, all issues settled at this peace agreement, and at this time, there was, like, you know, an offer to Palestinians as well, to settle -- to settle the case at this time, but they said, "No, we can't negotiate with the enemy.  No, we're going to take our -- you know, we're going to take our rights, or what we think it's our right, we're going to take it by force, whatever, whatever, whatever".  And then, you know, the funny thing is, all the -- all Arabs gathered against Egypt, oh, you are the only country who talk to the enemy
