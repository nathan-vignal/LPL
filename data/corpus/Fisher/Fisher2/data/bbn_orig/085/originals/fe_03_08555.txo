L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  This is Miriam.  Hello.
R:  Hi.  This is Jenny.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Um, so what do you think about it? [LAUGH]
L:  Well, um, sure.  I -- I think it's going to help to, um -- it can only help, basically.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Is what I think.  You know?  Where --
R:  Yeah.  No --
L:  Where are you -- where do you live?
R:  Um, Michigan.  Where are you from?
L:  Oh, okay.  Chica- -- um, I live -- I'm from Chicago but I live in Santa Monica.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  What is the security like in your airports?
R:  Um, [SIGH] well, the one y- -- the closest one to us is, um -- is Saginaw.  It's an international but it's just, like, a little -- like, there's three gates, you know?
L:  Okay.
R:  That's that.  Um, it is more intense.  Like, you're still -- if you -- like, we just got back from Cancun and everything, it's, like --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- you still have to arrive, like, two hours beforehand.  Um --
L:  Right.
R:  The only thing is that -- I mean, it's great and everything -- the only thing that I've really, um -- I don't like is it seems like there's, like, more and -- you know, more theft, which is fine.  I -- I mean, it's cool and everything that they are going through such strict measures but it's like, um ... I'm trying to think ... it wasn't Northwest, I think it was American Airlines, they -- you had to totally leave your luggage unlocked the whole flight.  You know, like, when you give it to them, um, it has to be totally unlocked and it stays unlocked.  You know what I'm saying?  So, they -- even after they check it --
L:  Oh, like, that's strange.
R:  -- it's still unlocked.
L:  You mean once it's in the, um -- it's tucked away in cargo it's unlocked?
R:  Yes.  Ev- -- yeah.
L:  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  So, that's -- that's -- yeah.  Um, 'cause normally we would fly, like, Northwest and Northwest, if you had -- you know, y- you would of course unlock it, have them check it and everything --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but you could lock it to make sure it's still secure.
L:  Sure.
R:  But with -- but with American Airlines, they leave it unlocked the whole time.  And my husband didn't really like that because of the fact, well, they could steal stuff from you or they could put --
L:  Right.
R:  -- something in there that didn't belong to you.  You know?
L:  That's true.
R:  And -- and I don't like that.  You know?  I don't --
L:  Hm.
R:  -- have the -- have a problem with them checking everything in and out and everything but let me put that lock on it once it leaves my sight.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  You know?  So, I mean, it -- it can only help but that's the only thing that I don't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- personally like.  You know?
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Um --
L:  Right.  I've got my personal dislikes that -- well, just personally, I don't like that they take away your tweezers.  You know?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  You can't [LAUGH] -- um, 'cause to me, you can use, ah -- probably you can use a -- the -- a pen the same way you can use a tweezers.  You know what I mean?
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  So, where do you draw the line?  But --
R:  I know.  I know.  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, I mean --
L:  Which is --
R:  -- common sense is gonna tell you you're not going to go and hurt someone with a pair of tweezers.  You know, like you said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the chances are better you could stab someone with a pen than a tw- -- pair of tweezers, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Or, like, your little pair of scissors.  That's a --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- the only thing.  But they did -- did you v- -- did you -- I don't know.  I think it's nationwide.  I don't think it's just in California.  We're now -- they're not requiring you to take your shoes off anymore.
R:  Oh, you know, the last time that we went -- like I said, this was a while -- it was, like, um -- we went in February and then we went another time on a flight in, um -- a day after Easter and at that time they were still ch- -- foot checking.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I don't know if that was just something recently that, you know, did that but, you know, again -- you know, I -- I felt a- a- a- -- you know, no problem.  I'd rather have 'em check things like that 'cause, you know, you could hide so many different things.
L:  Right.
R:  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Sure.
R:  As far as that goes.  You know?  So, I d- -- if they did cancel y- you know, or stop that, I think maybe they should just -- you know, it was random but at least the thought was there, "What if I'm picked?"  You know?  At least it would probably give 'em, you know -- if they were thinking of doing something like that then they would s- -- you know, think ahead.
L:  That's true.  That's true.
R:  You know?
L:  I guess they said the ones that declined taking their shoes off are gonna have to -- they have the possibility of going through stricter search at the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- next checkpoint or something.  But ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  I -- I know, other than that, they're really, you know, um -- you know, still the screening.  The only thing too, it seems like it really screws with your film.  It's, like, the more intense x-ray.  So, if you're [LAUGH] going on --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- a nice trip somewhere -- yeah.  When I got back, we had a lotta blotchy film.  And --
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  A- and we did carry it through.  You know what I'm saying?  We didn't put it through, like, the real intense one in our packed on luggage.  We carried it on but still, i- it was --
L:  Huh.
R:  -- it was darker.  You know?  It was --
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  So, I don't know if it was because of that but I know other people who went with us too because, um -- I -- I work for Sally Beauty Company and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- so, it's, like, one of our annual trips if you get enough things and so --
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  -- other people who went there too were, um, you know, complaining about the -- the darkness in their film.
L:  [NOISE] Really?
R:  So -- so, I'm wondering if it is the intensity of the x-ray now.
L:  It could be.  You know, it's interesting you say that 'cause I started, for some reason, just being really conscious about not bringing food through that thing 'cause you don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- know.
R:  Yeah.  You don't know with that.
L:  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  It's -- it's --
L:  I li- -- and --
R:  It's bad enou- --
L:  I like when they have -- some of these places have food courts once you're beyond the security but I don't like to them -- there's people that take their food through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Where I used to, you know, bring food and take it on the plane.  I won't do that anymore.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  It's bad enough that they're xraying you but let alone putting it through that thing.  You know?
L:  Right.
R:  God only knows what's go- -- in that.
L:  And now that you're saying that about the film, you know?
R:  Right.
L:  Really makes you think.
R:  Right.  So, I mean, I feel safer, you know, gon- gon- -- with this, you know, considering what's happened in the past and -- and I think it's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- probably deterred a lot, you know?  Well, I don't wanna say --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot 'cause I don't know but I'm sure it's deterred, you know, or made people more aware.
L:  Yeah.  I --
R:  You know?
L:  -- guess so.  I feel safer but at the same time, I feel like if somebody's really going to want to do that, they could still do it.  They're still --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- going to.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, you know, it could just be -- 'cause if these people are suicide bombers or whatever, what do they -- what do they have to lose?  You know what I mean?
R:  Right.  Because --
L:  So, if it --
R:  Right.  'Cause if it's not gonna be on a plane then it's gonna through an airport full of people.  You know?  So, what --
L:  That's true.
R:  Like you said, what difference does it make?  And I notice too that it was, like, after, you know, the September eleventh thing, it's, like, you couldn't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- park so close.  And now, they've, kind of, lifted the band on that.  You know?  I thought that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- they should've, you know -- you should s- -- only be able to park with so many feet in front and, um, I know in a lotta the airports it's like you can still drive right up to the door.  You know?
L:  That's a good point.  Sure.
R:  You know?  By the --
L:  Yeah.  That's true.  They're not checking you in your car -- what's in your --
R:  Right.
L:  -- car out front.
R:  Right.  And -- and with us living so close to Michigan, it was so funny because we can either go over the bridge or go through the tunnel and it would be, like, they would check you after you went past the point.  Not when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you're going through, like, the tunn- -- you know, like, say if you're going through the tunnel from the Canada side --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they won't ask you any questions 'til you get to Michigan and vice versa.
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, if you're underneath that tunnel and you set off explosives, that water, I mean, you -- you know, you've just -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  It's gonna be underwater.  It's gonna --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- be gone.  And -- and a- -- and that's a really -- you know, it's like they don't have, like, all their quirks fixed out or something.  You know what I'm saying?  That's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's the weird thing, you know?
L:  [NOISE] You know, and it's sad that it's gonna take an incident to happen first for them to think about it then.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Exactly.  So, it's, ah -- I don't know.  I mean, you know, it -- it's better but I still think --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that there could be a lot more that they could improve on or something.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know?
L:  I think so far, we're -- we've been lucky in the States, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  What's happening --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, overseas isn't happening here.  If it was, then things would be m- -- different --
R:  M- -- right.
L:  -- here.
R:  Exactly.
L:  The way they go about doing things.
R:  I know.  It's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  It's, like, so much has changed.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And all.  It's so weird.
L:  I know.
R:  No.  I don't --
L:  I feel safer but yet I still am apprehensive about flying, I have to say.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I still get, like, the butterflies in the stomach, like, "Oh, god".  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know? [LAUGH] And, like, they keep saying, "Well, if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen".  But -- yeah.  But don't [LAUGH] let it happen to me on this flight.  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  Right.  Right.  And why increase my chances?
R:  Right.
L:  I mean, obviously, you're -- you know, you can take your one or two trips a year but if I was gonna, maybe, take more than that, I might rethink it or double think it now.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?
R:  You know, and if -- and --
L:  Maybe think of taking --
R:  If it's easier to drive, you know, or if it's gonna --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- take just about -- whatever, it'd be safer, probably, to drive, you know?
L:  Right.  If you can find a way to vacation near your home, you might think about doing that.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  It's all strange.  God.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you live -- do you live near a busy airport or ...?
L:  Um, I don't live far from LAX.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, I'm about twenty minutes away or so.  So, that's --
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  -- the one I use now.  Yeah.  But, you know, I do notice, like you were saying, with the different airlines, for instance, United seems to be a lot quicker than American here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know?  The whole process.  It just seems like they run smoother or -- so, it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- makes me, you know, choose to take United over American.  I hear people that do American, it just takes forever.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The lines --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and the screening and everything else.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause, like I said, with Northwest, it's like as soon as they would check you, you know, and check your luggage, you could lock it right in front of them and there was no question.  And, you know, for --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- them to leave it unlocked, you know, even after they check it -- and they take it outta your sight to check it.  You know --
L:  Do you put a physical -- a physical lock on your suitcase?
R:  Oh, yeah.  They make you take it off.  They make you take it -- you cannot have --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- any lock or anything on that.
L:  'Cause I usually --
R:  Ah --
L:  -- don't travel with a lock but I had heard of a lot of stuff's going on at airports just in general.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's a smart thing to do.
R:  Well, you know, we always just did because it just seemed like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the thing to do.  You know what I'm saying?
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's, like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you'd just feel more secure.  Especially, like, if you're going to another country.  I don't need something --
L:  Of course.
R:  -- stuck in my suitcase and trying to explain to [LAUGH] -- you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't wanna go end up in the Tijuana Jail or something.  You know, you --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- don't know.
L:  You don't know.
R:  You don't know.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know?  And -- and so that's the only scary thing.  And like I said, I don't have a problem.  You can check everything.  You can drag everything out but it's, like, I would still -- after everything's done, put a lock on it.  You know?  And anything valuable --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I would carry with me anyway.
L:  Of course.  Right.
R:  But I just don't like the idea of it being left open, you know, was the only thing.
L:  I don't blame you.
R:  But -- so, I don't know.  But I know, like, you know -- but like my flight as far as I g- -- you know, as I'm -- I'm concerned, I don't fly like I used to or -- you know what I'm saying?  That type of --
L:  Yeah.
