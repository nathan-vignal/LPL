R:  Hello.
L:  Hello.  Hi.
R:  Hi.  It's A- -- my name's Andy.
L:  Derek.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Fine, how are you?
R:  Not bad. [LAUGH] 
L:  Are you in New York?
R:  What's that?
L:  Where are you located?
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Oh.
R:  Where are you guys?
L:  New York.
R:  New York. [LAUGH] Okay.  We can still have the conversation, right?
L:  That is true.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I feel like this is a scam, but I could be wrong.
R:  What?  That this whole thing is a scam?
L:  Yeah.  Have you done it before?
R:  No.  But [inaudible] a pretty -- pretty ah, prestigious place.
L:  Are they?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.  I wouldn't have done it if it -- if it -- if I didn't know who it was.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Ah, I'm involved in -- in the health care field for a medical web site so I'm kind of doing this as ah, almost like a research thing, just to see what it's about.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um --
L:  What the hell is the topic that we're supposed to talk about? [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, sounds like to me like high -- high salaries of athletes.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And whether they deserve the money they get.
L:  Um --
R:  You guys -- you should know about that, right?
L:  Well, that's supposing I'm a sports fan but I'm not, so 
R:  Okay.
L:  But um, do I believe that they deserve the high salaries that they get?
R:  Right.
L:  Ah --
R:  Well, I can tell you -- New Jersey Nets signed Jason Kidd to six years ninety nine million dollar contract.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's a lot of money.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I mean -- I -- I -- my feeling is if the market's going to bare it, then you know what, god bless 'em.
L:  You know what, it's like --
R:  If they can -- if they can get it, go for it. [LAUGH] 
L:  I feel like if they just lowered the salaries and people like that and give the money to like small countries in, you know, Africa, I feel that the world would be a better place.  That's what I think they should do with the salaries.
R:  I -- I -- I agree with --
L:  They should cut them -- they should cut them by twenty five percent and then send all the twenty five percent to -- or even what, five percent, I don't really care --
R:  Right.
L:  -- what they -- you know, five, do five percent, you know if it's that big of a deal, and um, you know ah, and then send it to like, you know, Rwanda.  You know how ma- -- you know how many schools and how much food they could make with that kind of crap?
R:  I agree with you though on that.  I -- I'm -- I'm kind of kidding when I say, "God bless you", I mean, if you can get as much as you can [LAUGH] but I mean, it's going to go out of control at some point and the bubble has to burst.  That's the way I think it will happen.  They're -- they're putting salary caps and all this stuff, but it got -- I don't know where they get -- it got crazy like this.  Ah, it just seems to me all of a sudden, I mean, I read the old stories about the old athletes playing for five and ten thousand dollars a year.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it became -- I think as soon as the, with TV contracts and stuff like that, I think that's when the salaries, you know, became nuts.  Because the -- the athletes knew that the teams were making billions of dollars from TV --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so they figured they could exploit the teams since ah, they were exploiting the, ah, the sports networks.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, I -- you know, and the NFL gets like, billions from, I guess whoever it is, Fox or whoever carries these ga- -- the contracts for these games so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the advertising and then that also drives up all across the products, 'cause they're paying, you know what I mean, it's all a vicious circle.
L:  I agree with that totally.
R:  I mean, it's kind of ridiculous if someone gets, like, I don't know who the craziest contract -- I've heard of like, ah, ten years for like a hundred and sixty million doll- -- I mean, it is -- how much money do you really need?
L:  That's the thing -- I mean --
R:  You know.
L:  -- I think that they need to make the poor richer and the richer not so rich. [LAUGH] That's what I think.
R:  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, how much money can you really have?  How big of a house can you possibly have if you're an athlete, your wife and three kids?  I mean, do you really need twenty bedrooms and seventeen cars? [LAUGH] 
L:  Ah, probably not.  But ah, but anyway, and you know what, like they can get paid that, so why not?  You know.
R:  Well that's the thing -- that's what I li- -- I mean, I -- I figure the team, I mean the teams and these other guys are making so much money, I mean if it -- if -- I'd like to see everybody have a comfortable life.  I'm not sure you necessarily need, you know, two hundred million, but, I mean, it does a lot for somebody maybe who wouldn't otherwise be able to make that kind of huge money, I mean, they're making way more than I am.
L:  Don't I know it.
R:  But maybe somebody who would not necessarily have made -- had that chance to really -- but some guys, I mean, like the Eagles, not their -- their defense Philly, but Troy Vincent who's a Philadelphia Eagle, he's taking a lot of his money and putting it, you know, he's put it back into -- he lives -- he -- I think he originally is from either Trenton or one of the other bigger cities in New Jersey, and he's established all kinds of, you know, funds.  I'm sure he's the exception and not the rule.
L:  Yeah, prob- -- yeah -- yeah, I mean he's I think, one of the many exceptions, know what I mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Opposed to the one and only exception, because I -- and if there's an exception to the rule once, there's usually an exception to the rule many times, you know what I mean.
R:  Right.  Me, as I say, I'm -- I'm hoping that he's not the only -- a lot of these guys also don't all publicize a lot of this stuff, too.  I mean, they do do some decent things, you know, with their money.  They set up foundations and that kind of stuff, but I -- I don't know why they don't want to make that, you know, known to the public, but 
L:  It's -- it's a shocker [several inaudible words] that's why I don't watch sports for the most part.  Actually at all, because I don't find them interesting. [LAUGH] 
R:  Is it because you don't like sports or because of the athletes that, you know, the whole ?
L:  No, it's just -- I just I have no interest in it.  My grandfather likes it.  He enjoys it --
R:  Right.
L:  -- that's great, he can enjoy it.  I don't have any interest in it.  Plus my TV, I only have one channel on my TV, you know, like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I just plugged it in, like, you know, two weeks ago and I have two channels and one of them is too fuzzy to look at so I have one channel.  And you know, my one channel, it doesn't play sports, so um, you know, it's like channel four, you know, and whatever it is, I'm usually not home on a Sunday afternoon, you know, or whatever, to watch a game, so I don't watch the game, you know.
R:  I think, see in our house-- it's a -- we're big sports family because ah, I have four -- four kids and two of them are older boys who are involved in sports, so --
L:  Oh.  How old are they?
R:  They're seventeen and fourteen and they're both -- one's involved in ice hockey and the other's in cross country.
L:  That -- that's nice.  That's different.  Like I don't know if I would watch sports, but I would get involved in their sports, do you know what I mean?
R:  Right.  So I guess for my son and I, we both play a little bit of ice hockey.  He played with me the other night and, you know, we -- it's kind of -- it gives us a chance to do something too.  But I mean, we don't, obviously we don't do anything for the money.  We just do it because we love the sport.  So I'm not sure whether these guys really do it because they love the sport or they love the money.  Maybe it's a little bit of both.
L:  Ah, I don't know.  I mean, I think it starts off as a love of sport and then ch- -- and then, I don't know, I think it goes both ways, then you just get so comfortable.  I mean, you just -- you're -- you're at the height of your game --
R:  Right.
L:  -- [several inaudible words] in terms of ah, you know, in terms of ah, you know, money, career and you know, being happy with your job, hopefully.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.
R:  Yeah, like for us too, in Philly with Kobe Bryant, he just, you know.  What's going on with him now, and he -- he's really local to us here, I mean, he grad- -- went to high school about fifteen miles from here.  Everybody knew him and he comes from a great family, the whole bit
