L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Um, this is Carol.
R:  Hi, this is Ron.  How are you?
L:  Good.  Um, I think, number one, that professional athletes are grossly overpaid.
R:  I agree.
L:  I -- you agree with that?
R:  Yes.
L:  Yes.  Yes.  Ah, I mean they do perform a lot of entertainment and stuff like that but still, I -- I think they're -- they're too -- paid too much.  And as far as going on strike, that's kind of an iffy thing.  They actually are hired into a job so I suppose that does give them a right to strike if something ain't going their way, or they feel something's wrong.
R:  Yeah, but I mean, come on, you know, like, how bad can it be going if you're making -- you know --
L:  Yeah, really, if you're making all those big bucks. [LAUGH] 
R:  Like, how bad is it really?  You know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I mean, on the one hand, you know, like I am, you know, disgusted by what, you know, baseball players make and professional ath- -- you know, basketball players.  I think they should get paid well, you know, but I don't think that, like, crazy multi million dollar contracts make any sense, you know, like that is just --
L:  No that --
R:  -- poor distribution of wealth, you know, and like, bad for business and therefore bad for sports, you know.  On the other hand, I am always in favor of labor saying what they need to say, you know.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And if it's really a labor issue they should find a way to reconcile their -- their ridiculous pay scales with, you know, their -- their -- you know, a -- a um, you know, a straight forward, you know, statement of their issues and complaints, you know, and get their lawyers and take it, you know, to, you know, don't dillydally.  You know, don't go on strike if you haven't, you know, pressured and met and, you know, attempted to have someone mediate.  And I don't think they've done that, you know.  They just want -- they just want more money or changes to their sched- -- you know, pay scale.
L:  Yeah, that is -- that is -- that is true.  I agree with the labor issues, yes.  Um 
R:  Yeah, I mean, how can you, you know -- labor -- labor always needs to be able to speak up.
L:  Right to -- for their --
R:  But how do you pay someone --
L:  -- rights.
R:  -- how much do these basketball guys make?  Or like baseball guys, like ?
L:  They probably make more than I'll make in my lifetime. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, absolutely.  You know.  Let me tell you something:  You know, I'm a teacher, you know how much money I'm going to make?
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  You know, like I'm going to make nothing unless I hit the lottery, and like, you know, the difference is that a lot of people who feel like they need to make a whole lot of money, you know, they're -- they -- they can't be happy with a lot of money and they can't be happy with, you know, with no money.  Either way they're not going to be happy.
L:  Yeah, and -- and another issue too on that, it wasn't really part of the topic, but I think a lot of your professional athletes are not setting good examples for the kids.  There are some, but there are some that do not.
R:  Well, you know what --
L:  That set good examples for kids.
R:  -- there, we might disagree, because I don't know that a professional athlete has a responsibility to --
L:  No, they don't, but --
R:  -- you know, like, i- -- if someone shows up to play basketball, they're not necessarily showing up to make friends with the people on their team.  They're not necessarily show- -- you know, showing up, you know, with a disdain for the idea of endorsing a product somewhere down the line, you know.  They're showing up to play basketball and to win basketball and to, you know, I mean, I -- I don't know that they're bound to be a role model.  For me as a teacher, I'm also a musician, you know, and I play music and the music that I play is -- is um, you know, it's aggressive music, you know, it's political politicized music, right, and I'm also a teacher.  And you know, it's ah, y- -- i- -- it's that, you know, I can live my life in hold, that I don't have to bite my tongue if I have something to say, you know, and I -- I feel like while some people may take it upon themselves to be good role models and go out of their way to make that a part of, you know, how they -- how they do what they do, they're not bound to it.  That's all.
L:  No, they're not bound to it, but I think that ah, like I said, you said they're going out there to play a game and stuff like that, but the fact of the matter is that kids do, whether or not that player's responsible or not, those kids do look up to people in the spotlight.  That -- they do do that.
R:  I agree.  But you know what?  Their parents should also be able to be there to help them analyze what it is that they're seeing, you know, and you know, I didn't -- I didn't ever idolize a -- a professional athlete, you know, like I was interested in their accomplishments and seeing people hit, like a landmark, you know, home run or like a c- -- you know, like an all time record achieved, but I never gave -- I never gave a shit about -- about, you know, any professional athlete or any musician or any TV star.  
L:  Mm.
R:  You know, because my parents said, you know, you don't base yourself on what you see of this person on television, you know, like, television is not reality.
L:  That's true.  Mhm.
R:  You know, an- -- and if the parents are sitting around and you know, y- -- you just can't blame the kid if kids have no guidance.  You know what I mean?  And therefore you can't blame the -- the pop icons who's now kind of slipped into this role as a -- as a ah, you know, like a -- like a moral iconoclast for you know, kids to follow and like, I'll grow up to be like that guy, you know, like.  I'm glad I like seeing people pissed off about Eminem and things like that, you know, like I think it's funny, because, you know, you have to ask yourself, like why are you getting pissed off?  You know, like what it is about this that really upsets you?  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  You know, like, I -- I -- I don't want to, you know, you sound like you don't like what I just said.
L:  Ah, no, you know, that -- that's your opinion and stuff like that, you know, that -- that is your opinion.  Um, we all have different ideas or else it'd be, you know, kind of boring out there.  But um, I don't know, the -- to kind of get back to the subject and stuff, well I, um, I don't know, you know, how far that they -- that they really want us to stick on this -- you know, the pay thing and stuff.
R:  Well we can -- we can find something else to ta- -- you know, touch on with.  Like, how about, um, the idea that, ah, you know, they get paid -- well no, that's no good.  Um, I don't know. [LAUGH] I don't know what else to say about it, you know, like --
L:  I know, yeah, we better stick --
R:  -- to be honest with you, it's not an issue that really interests me very much, you know, like, I -- I think it's ridiculous.  I have no ability to influence it, you know, unless I --
L:  Right.
R:  -- dedicate my time to it and so I'm just going to hope that common sense patches it up, you know, 'cause otherwise it's just another example of people behaving badly.
L:  But they've already done this for so long and the players know that they're going to be able to ask for the higher money, and get it.  They're -- they're almost to the point now where they can't say, "Well, you know, here's the cutoff line.  This is what we're going to pay you.  That's it."
R:  Yeah, but that won't happen.  That's --
L:  Because they -- they, for so long, gone along with this then they usually break in and come up with something, oh yeah, we'll go with this,  And so I -- I just don't think that there is going to be any curb on the pay.
R:  You know what though?  Those industries, they're frail.  Like, if you i- -- i- -- if this country was in a war that lasted longer.  If there was a major, you know, catastrophe here like another terrorist event, you know, like, you watch baseball players and basketball players and football players start earning, you know, no more than two hundred thousand dollars a year, you know.  I -- I'm sure you would see that.  That's -- it's -- it's such a frail industry.  It's -- it's, you know, only, I mean, it will never disappear because people love it and people kind of need it, but, you know, its status as a big money industry right now is -- is a temporary one, to say the least, you know.  If you look at the growth of the games and -- and professional sports versus, you know, how ah, industry has influenced activities over the, you know, what people do, I mean, it's completely, you know, ah, a very short amount of time in the span of professional sports that this over commercialization has taken place, and you know, like, it's very possible in thirty years they'd be saying, "Oh yeah, remember those, like, ten years where players were just getting so much money, and then the bub- -- you know, the bubble burst one way or another."
L:  Hm.
R:  You know?
L:  You really think -- you really think that that -- that that -- that the is a possibility that there would be, you know, a curb on that?  I ah, I don't know.  It's just been going up, you know, year after year after year.  Like you say, there hasn't been anything yet to stop it, that um -- I just, I don't know, I -- I -- I see that on the screens that someone settled for this or in the papers, you know, they go this and I -- I just think, oh man.  What a waste. [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what?  Like, you gotta look at stuff like the XFL, you know.  Here they are, it's like the peak of professional sports, it's the late nineties and, you know, a bunch of venture capitalists come together and say, "We're going to start a new sports franchise.  We're going to start a whole league, you know, and we're going to birth it with all the things
