L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  April Wilson.
L:  Ah, Marie Maie[?].  How are you today?
R:  Okay.
L:  Thanks[?].  So, what do you think?
R:  Um, well, I think that he stopped it too soon 'cause our soldiers are still getting snipered down there -- or over there and, ah, we need to take care of it.
L:  Yeah.  I agree.  I --
R:  I mean, if we -- if it was over with, why are they still killing our soldiers?  See, my son's in the navy -- he's on a ship.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I'm just thoroughly mad.
L:  Well, I'm from a military family.  My father was a lifer and my first husband was a soldier.  So, um --
R:  I mean, either we're gonna go over there and bring 'em down, make 'em act right, or we're gonna pull out.  If you're gonna pull out, you need to pull 'em all out.
L:  Well, at this point where they've pulled so many out, I think -- I think they ought to just pull out and there's never gonna be any peace over there.  Those people have been living with war for --
R:  Since time began.
L:  That's right.  They don't want peace and --
R:  T- -- well --
L:  Let 'em kill each other. [LAUGH]
R:  It's none of our business. [LAUGH] W- -- ha- -- we went over there, actually, but it's none of our business.
L:  No.
R:  Stuck our foot in it and -- but -- well, I don't understand why he's leaving some soldiers back.  He pulled the -- everybody but these few and they're ending up getting killed every day.
L:  That's right.  Yeah.
R:  Get --
L:  They've got the sniper attacks and ambushes and --
R:  Get our boys home and just leave these people alone. [SIGH] That is the way I feel about it.  I'm sorry.  It just makes me angry. [NOISE]
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's, um -- it's a losing battle.
R:  Yeah.  Like Vietnam.
L:  Well, and -- you know, all the infrastructure that we have, um, fixed and -- and put back up, they've destroyed again.
R:  Yeah.  See, it --
L:  Yeah.  They claim -- they -- they claimed that they wanted our -- our help, that they wanted us to stay and help b- -- put the pieces back together a- -- since we didn't in ninety two.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but they don't want our help.
R:  No.  I know.  If they want our help, they'd stop all this mess.  And all the sniper and the bombers -- the suicidal bombers, the kamikaze pilots, you know?  Walk into a building with a bomb on them and it goes off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I mean, come on.
L:  Yeah.  I think we need to bring our soldiers home and close our borders.
R:  And just let it go at that.  Let 'em suffer for what they've -- they're gonna suffer 'cause it's really none of our business.
L:  No.  It's really not.  And now -- now Africa wants us to come and be a -- a peacemaker over there after the way the world treated us --
R:  Wha- -- I didn't --
L:  -- going into --
R:  -- hear that.  I must have missed -- I guess I haven't been watching TV enough.  I didn't hear that.
L:  Yeah.  Africa has asked, ah, President Bush to -- to, ah, send two thousand American troops for a peacekeeping, ah, mission over in -- in, um --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- I forget which country in Africa.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's none of our business too.
L:  No, it's not.  But he -- but President Bush has sent a -- a -- an entourage --
R:  He's already sent people?
L:  -- of diplomats over there to see if they're gonna do it.
R:  He's already sent people over there?
L:  He's -- he's sent a -- a group of diplomats to look --
R:  Oh, to see what --
L:  -- into the --
R:  Yeah.  Uh-uh.
L:  But --
R:  He needs to quit now.
L:  He will -- he will lose my support altogether if -- if he sends anyone over there too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  No.  It's not a n- -- [SIGH] we need to -- look, we got starving people here.
L:  M- -- ha- --
R:  I mean, on --
L:  We're not the world's police force either.
R:  Ki- -- well, kids on the street here in the United States of America are starving but yet we're sending money over to Ethiopia and all of them.  Look, you gotta take care of business at home first.
L:  That's right.
R:  You know?  Take care of business at home first.  We've got starving families, starving children.  I mean, come on.  All that money's for --
L:  But we shouldn't be the -- we shouldn't be expected to be the world's police force.
R:  No.
L:  Then when we went over to Iraq, the rest of the world really came down on us and now the a- -- now the UN seems to want us to go over to Africa and I just -- I just think we should tell the rest of the world, "Okay, we're -- we're sorry".  We --
R:  We're done now.
L:  We, ah --
R:  Find you another police state.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hear -- I just -- I didn't know th- that about Africa.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm gonna have to start listening closel- -- closer.  See, my, ah --
L:  Yeah.  Look it up on one of the -- th- there's, um -- there's information on some of the internet news sites --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- like, n- News Max and -- and, ah, World Mart or wor- --
R:  Well, you know, my roommate --
L:  -- World Net Daily.
R:  My roommate broke her back and I've been, ah, you know, her nurse t- -- I take -- her nurse, whatever.  I take care of her all the time.
L:  Oh.
R:  'Til she -- they're gonna give her surgery and she has to apply, you know, for a social security disability and all that 'cause she has no money coming in now.  She's not gonna be able to work for the rest of her life.  And they've -- have fought it so hard with a, um -- with a broken back, they denied her twice. [PAUSE] And what's happening is they're giving all the social security b- -- money and stuff away also so the people that really do need it can't get it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's the only thing I could see why they would turn her down.  We've finally got a lawyer. [PAUSE] I mean -- 'cause that's ridiculous.  A- -- people -- well, we -- people use the system here too.
L:  Well, but, you know, that -- that's another thing is our social security system i- -- th- these SSI payments they bring people s- -- over -- people who are beyond the working age, they bring over from foreign countries and they put 'em SSI, which is -- is really a welfare program and they give them our social security dollars.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause this -- well, disability is different from SSI but, ah --
L:  But it's social security.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- disability is earned.
R:  Right.  And -- well, that's what we -- she's filing for -- disability -- SSI disability.  They told her that there was nothing wrong with her. [PAUSE] [LAUGH] The first doctor told her, "There's nothing wrong with you".  Well, we've -- have our own MRI and xrays and you could see where the fracture is [LAUGH] in the back and her backbone is touching her vertebrae a- -- bone to bone.  They say the disks are gone. [PAUSE] And, I mean, it's right there in plain sight in front of you.  She cannot walk.  She has a fractured back. [PAUSE]
L:  Oh, dear.
R:  And she -- they still [LAUGH] denied her. [LAUGH] So, we broke down and got a lawyer because this is ridiculous. [PAUSE] Absolutely.  And I think it -- I wish we could figure out something how to -- the people that use it that don't need it, to police that in another way.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess they send people out to their residences and stuff. [PAUSE]
L:  Yeah.  Well, back to our topic though I -- I -- I wish that the president would listen to the American people and bring the rest of 'em home.
R:  Y- -- just bring 'em home.
L:  We're spending so much money over there.   We've at least spent so much money fighting that war -- war to liberate those people and -- and there are probably some that really did want the liberation but, um, it -- it appears that the majority of 'em don't.
R:  Evidently not.  But, like you said, I don't understand why he left the few down there that he did.  Supposed to be, ah, policing the ar- -- you know, making sure everything's okay and they're getting killed.
L:  Well, they're supposed to be rebuilding the infrastructure and instead, they're -- they're having to -- they're having to police.  So, they're having to do both.
R:  And even that's dangerous with snipers.
L:  And they're still looking for the -- the weapons of mass destruction and -- and I don't care what they say, I still believe they're there somewhere.
R:  Me too.
L:  That's a big country and there are lots of --
R:  M- --
L:  -- um --
R:  Lots of sand.
L:  -- caves and -- and gullies and -- and --
R:  Oh, shoot.  The- they could dig -- they could've made everything underground and there's --
L:  And so then --
R:  -- so much sand it'll cover it up.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Shoot.
L:  I think it's there somewhere.  Either that or he moved it.
R:  I don't know where he'd move it to.
L:  Um, he could move it to, ah, Syria.
R:  Well ... h- -- that would be a pretty big thing to move, that's if they'd notice.  You know what I mean?
L:  Well, I guess it depends because they found some of it in -- some of the components of it in, um, some, like, semi tractor trailer.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ... [NOISE]
R:  Shoot.  I don't know.  Like I said, my son's in --
L:  I just wish that we'd -- we had found him 'cause it's never gonna be over until --
R:  Uh-uh.  Until we get him.
L:  And his sons.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause that -- the legacy runs on.  Yeah.  And they to- -- they did that, ah, DNA on that stuff -- those bones they found and they can't tell if it's him or not.
L:  I think he's still alive.
R:  I do too.  I think he's still alive and I still think he's got the nuclear power.  You know?  But one thing is, I'm -- wonder why he hasn't used it already? [PAUSE] I mean, they've flown -- they -- you know, nine eleven, you know, that's mass destruction.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And why is he just playing around then?  Why doesn't he just, you know, push the button?
L:  Well, a- -- he lost an awful lot of his -- his, ah, army and a lot of his top advisors and -- and he's probably restructuring. [PAUSE] Yeah.  I --
R:  So --
L:  I think he's still gonna be a force to be reckoned with but I think we should -- we should close our borders to any immigrants from any of the -- any --
