R:  Hi, I'm Lila.
L:  Hi, this is Jason.
R:  [LAUGH] Hi -- hi Jason.  What do you think of ah, the way the -- the, ah, rich pro athletes go on strike?
L:  Oh man, what a joke. [LAUGH]
R:  You got that right. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Come on, they're already making millions of dollars, and they're striking?
R:  Exactly, and they want to strike for more.  It's like, get real people.
L:  I know.  Get a life.
R:  I mean if everyone's like some -- some poor, you know, some -- I -- I can't even think of anybody of TV that's poor, [several inaudible words] --
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  -- but it's like, yeah, the Wa- -- the Warner Brothers. [LAUGH] Some -- you know, some of the actors in Warner Brothers going on strike.  I feel for them, but otherwise --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, look at it.  Friends each make over a million an episode!
L:  I know.
R:  And ah --
L:  That's crazy.
R:  -- it's kind of ridiculous.
L:  Totally ridiculous.
R:  So it's like ah -- so if you can throw a ball over one side you get a million dollars.  Hey, I'll play --
L:  Yeah, no kidding.  I mean, if they making like maybe fifty thousand a year at any one thing, but you know, come on.  They're making millions of dollars.  You know, like the --
R:  I wouldn't know what to do with fifty thousand a year. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Is that right?
R:  Mm.
L:  That was funny.  I, ah, where I um -- did you hear about that one young kid fresh out of high school that got a contract, um, a basketball contract, I'm not sure what ah --
R:  Yes, it's -- I live in Cleveland, Ohio, I know.
L:  Okay.
R:  Le- -- Le-- LeVar -- LeBron James.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, something like that.
R:  I'm well aware, yeah, and our team got him.  Cleveland's team.  It's like, oh my god!
L:  Ninety million for a Nike contract?  I mean, that's unbelievable.
R:  And believe me, the team he signed for sucks.
L:  Yeah.  No kidding.
R:  So, you know, it's like losing -- they're going to be losing so much money if he doesn't get this team into shape.
L:  Yeah, no kidding.
R:  And -- and guarantee when his contract expires he's going to want a lot more money.
L:  Oh, no kidding.  That's just -- that's unbelievable.  Ninety mil- -- I don't even -- that's crazy.  I can't even -- [inaudible] I can't even find him five hundred dollars or whatever but that's -- that's just nuts. [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, you can imagine would they would say about[?] five hundred thousand, but ninety million.  And he just graduated from high school, what good[?] is he going to do?
L:  Oh yeah.  He probably doesn't even know what to think of it himself.  He's probably like, you know, um, like, "Well, what do I do with ninety million dollars?" You know?
R:  Well did you hear about that thing that went on his ah, his -- supposedly, his mother bought him a, ah, one of those big, what do they call those things?  SUVs or whatever?
L:  Oh yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, there was a big thing over that, 'cause you know, oh yeah, some company gave it to him and he's taking money from [inaudible] you know, from like [inaudible] Nike, or whatever --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, that was a big thing in this city. [LAUGH] 
L:  Really?
R:  Sometimes the ah, pardon my French, but the crap is so deep --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you can't dig out of it.  It's like, oh jeeze.
L:  So he ah, so he received an SUV for free from somebody?
R:  No, what -- what -- they were saying, the ah, T- -- local TV stations were saying that some, like Nike, or whatever --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- was giving it to him to sell their products and then somehow they -- his f- -- family came up with some story about how his mother put the down payment on it.
L:  Really?
R:  Well, but if you put the down payment, who's making the payments?
L:  Exactly. [LAUGH] 
R:  And it's like, oh please, and these people want to strike for more money --
L:  That's unbelievable.
R:  -- that's ridiculous.  It's like, oh, you don't have -- you have what, three million in the bank, you know, right now, and you need more money?
L:  Yeah.  No kidding.  That's just crazy.  I can't -- I mean I can't imagine.  Well, like, ah, what's the name of the guy on Friends that has like real dark hair, um, he's -- trying to think what his name is.
R:  I can't -- 
L:  There's two of -- there's two of 'em.
R:  There is ah, Chander's name is -- I -- we usually watch the show when there's nothing else on.  Oh --
L:  I can't remember, but anyway --
R:  -- is he the one that just got married, or the, ah, tall, geeky one?
L:  Tall geeky one, I think.
R:  David Trimmer.
L:  Yeah, yeah, he -- he -- he's made over three hundred something million just from that show alone. [LAUGH] 
R:  I can believe it.
L:  And that doesn't include, you know, um, movies he's done, which he's done a number of movies, you know, stuff like that.  Um, on the outside, it's like -- and I guess now -- I saw him on um, he's doing something with um, his own ah, what do you call it, like a play or some sort or something like that?
R:  Yes.  I was reading about that one he did.  Yeah, he's -- with his own production --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is something he's always wanted to do, I guess, whatever, so --
R:  Yeah, yeah, he can do it for free.  He's got three hundred million [LAUGH] sitting somewhere in the bank.
L:  Oh I know, he -- he's got more than he'll ever need.  I mean -- I mean he hasn't --
R:  He's got more than enough for the whole -- probably the whole state he lives in. [LAUGH] Oh yeah.
L:  He's got enough for his grandchildren's grandchildren. [LAUGH] And more.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, his future is ah, ten -- ten leagues down the road they'll be thinking David Trimmer going, "Oh, Grandpa David, we love you so much."
L:  [LAUGH] No kidding.  Yeah, that's just crazy.  I can't imagine, um, having any kind of -- any money close to that, you know, so --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yeah, they -- I think that -- I mean ah, the whole thing with the striking's just unbelievable.  I mean they -- they have way more than they need and now they're striking for more.  It's like, well when will it end?  You know?
R:  What state do you live in?
