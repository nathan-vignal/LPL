R:  I'm Madeline Oldfield.  I live in Roseburg, Oregon.
L:  Hi.  I'm Elvira Orbroth[?] and I live in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.
L:  M- --
R:  Have you flown recently?
L:  Mm, [LIPSMACK] now, I don't fly -- I a- -- don't fly that often.  I flew a c- couple of years ago.  Um, have you flown recently?
R:  I flew in, ah, February -- January and February and then I flew last November -- October and November.  We went down to Arizona to, ah, Death Valley and then I went down --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to Quartzsite on the later trip.
L:  Oh.
R:  And, ah, I was not too impressed with airport security.
L:  Oh.
R:  It looked good but surprisingly, when on the f- -- a trip down there was a young man in a -- he had a -- was in a wheelchair --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he had some things on his leg.  He'd broken bones very badly so he had this metal thing on his leg that was spreading his bones apart and holding them in place.
L:  Okay.
R:  He discovered [SIGH] halfway through the flight, that they had missed a good size --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- knife that he was carrying.
L:  Oh, my. [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  And on --
L:  And I -- oh.
R:  So, that -- you know, I was a little startled at that one.
L:  Right.
R:  And on the way back, I had a funny little box cutter that was in a plastic key case.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They missed that and I didn't realize it either.
L:  Oh, see.  And see if you -- if -- good thing you were -- it was, um, good incidents where people weren't criminals or were trying to hide it.
R:  Right.
L:  So --
R:  I -- you know, it w- -- it looks impressive --
L:  Right.  Beca- --
R:  -- with the people running around in c- -- in camo and -- and guns and that.
L:  Do you --
R:  And I think that they probably -- there are -- it's a lot more heightened than it was.
L:  Okay.  Um, we haven't heard of any incidents for a long time.  I don't know if that is good or just because they're missing [LAUGH] people. [LAUGH] Or --
R:  Well ... [PAUSE]
L:  [NOISE] Some of the people seem to have been, um, really -- the people that they've caught have been profiled so highly, like the guy that set his shoes -- that had the stuff in his shoes and [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, yeah.  That was -- that was really scary thinking that, ah, if the passengers hadn't caught him, he would -- he w- -- might have taken that plane out.
L:  Right.  Because it wasn't, um -- nothing was found on him until he was on the plane. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, evidently, the stuff in his shoes did not show up.  Now, some of the airports have dogs that check for explosives.
L:  Okay.  Ah, see I haven't flown since the, um, heightened security and before that we flew to San Jose, California and, um, when we were there -- when we were coming back again, my husband went through and he -- the alarm went off and he didn't have anything. [LAUGH] And, um, I don't know if it's because he had prostate cancer year- -- a couple of years before that and had seed implants but he went through the machine, like, three times and they, kinda, patted him down and then finally they said, "Go". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I set the alarm off and I set the alarm off because I have aluminum -- I have a metal frame glasses.
L:  Okay.
R:  And I have a couple of barrettes in my hair and that's the only thing I could think of that set it off because I had taken my watch and everything off.  But the same exact things that I was wearing in one airport that set it off didn't set it off in another airport.
L:  Right.  Because he only had it when -- on the flight home.  He didn't have it when we went and that seems strange.  Ah --
R:  Yeah.  You wonder how they calibrate them.
L:  Right.
R:  'Cause it seems that the same things should set off every, um, alarms in any airport.
L:  Yes.  So, what did they do then when the alarm went off?
R:  Then they take and pull you aside and they check you with a wand -- a hand held --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- thing to see where you buzz.
L:  Well, that's what they did with him too and it kept going off and they didn't find anything so they just, um -- I mean, they didn't search him or anything.  They -- they just said, "Go ahead". [LAUGH]
R:  Well, do you think they do profiling to a certain extent too?
L:  And I wonder if you're the type -- I mean, I do hear that, okay, they don't and it's every third per- -- every thirtieth person or something like that they s- -- make 'em take off their shoes or something.  But it almost seems as if they're still looking for somebody that fits a certain profile. [LAUGH] Don't -- or do you think so or ...?
R:  That's what I wonder.
L:  Mm.
R:  Though I did watch them, ah, pull out a pilot --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and search him.
L:  Well, of course it could --
R:  So --
L:  -- could be a pilot too.  Um, they had, um -- I mean, the pilots were, ah, grounded.  There was a story around about a year ago where the pilots had been drinking and they failed that test.  So, a pilot is not above suspicion but I -- I think -- I mean, if you were ... [LIPSMACK] oh, I don't know ... from certain countries or, um -- oh, and I -- now, they say too your -- if you pay with cash that you would be -- that would be suspect.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  Because --
R:  Oh, I know one way tickets are suspect.
L:  Okay.  And, um, they said if they can't, um -- there're certain things like that because they can't really trace you.  If you haven't lived a certain place that long, that would hit -- that would trigger some type of alarm.  And --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- simply because they couldn't -- they -- they couldn't prove that you were really, um, a -- a person that was a stable person.  So, u- um, they said that certain things do trigger you.  Um, and I -- I don't know.  It's -- and sometimes airline tickets are so inexpensive that people could pay with cash. [LAUGH] I mean, some people prefer to use cash rather than a credit card or something like that. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, some people still do not, ah -- do not use credit cards.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  And because, ah, people choose not to, they are, um, thought of as, um -- it could trigger some type of an alarm.  But is it -- it's [MN] -- are you not suspect if you're older or young or over a certain age?  Would that lessen the, um -- they say they don't profile a- -- right?  Or [LAUGH] --
R:  Well, they say they don't but I have a hunch; if you were a young, Arab looking man --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they would pay more attention to you than they would an eighty year old lady that looked like a Sunday school teacher.
L:  I -- I think you're right.  I think you're right.  I think they do and I -- and I don't know how that makes me feel because, um, [LAUGH] if I was the type that would be profiled, it would be bad.  I mean, it would be very upsetting. [LAUGH] It m- --
R:  Well, it -- you know it's ups- -- would be upsetting in a way but still, you might think, "Well, this shows that they're really on the job".
L:  That's true too.  Because sometimes, um, ah -- and I'm thinking, [LAUGH] for instance, when you go to a bank, when they ask you to -- for identification, we shouldn't be upset, we should be thankful that they're really being precautious.  So, maybe it's the same way in the airport if, um -- you know, if we do -- of course, I'm not a -- a young, [LAUGH] Arabian man so, ah --
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm not either.  I'm a sixty three year --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- ah, white female.
L:  Mhm.  Well, I'm about the same age.  I'm sixty fi- -- actually, I'm two years older -- I'm sixty five.  And so, maybe I wouldn't be -- trigger any alarms [LAUGH] or I probably wouldn't, [LAUGH] um, is a -- as a profiler.  But that doesn't mean that, um, they wouldn't choose that type of a person to, um, try to tempt or try to carry something aboard.
R:  Right.  Like that lady over -- on the plane that went down over Lockerbie that carried, I think it was, a radio from --
L:  Right.
R:  -- her boyfriend that she didn't even realize had this explosive in it.  Yeah.
L:  Right.  Or if you would --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- say the wrong thing, they would -- wasn't there a case where a woman, um --
