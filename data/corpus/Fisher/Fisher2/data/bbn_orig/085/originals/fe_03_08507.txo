L:  Hi, my name is Angela Alvariz.
R:  Hi, my name is Annie, from Pasadena.
L:  Hi. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  How are you?
R:  Fine thank you.  Well --
L:  What's the topic today?
R:  Um, how do you feel about athletes --
L:  About athletes making the high salaries that they do?
R:  Yes, and also, um, whether they should strike or not.  Well, um, some -- well, the owners are making a lot of money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, so the --
L:  This the Fisher, ah, thing about the ten minutes we talk about a topic.  I'm sorry, yeah, they're making a lot of money and I agree with you on that.  I -- sometimes I don't think it -- it's right, you know, I think that sometimes athletes are taken advantage of.
R:  Yeah.  Um, I think that um, depending on -- on the team and the amount of money that the owners are making, so they should get a certain, you know, percentage --
L:  Mhm, exactly.  Because they're the ones that have to suffer the injuries.
R:  Yes.
L:  And the type of injuries that they could suffer, you know, could be permanent.  I mean, [LAUGH] pretty much.
R:  A- -- absolutely.  And in terms of the striking, um -- um, I sometimes think it's an overkill.  Sometimes I think they really have enough money compared to my -- my salary. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Oh yeah.
R:  It sounds like an overkill, but --
L:  They're making millions and millions of dollars, and I -- of course I, I'm not really at it, as far as sport, um, the type of sports or anything, but I don't think they used to pay us quite as much back in you know, twenty, twenty five, thirty years ago as they do now.
R:  Um, absolutely.  But the amount of tickets and the amount of people that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go to the games has increased and there are um, television contracts and things like that --
L:  Yeah.  Now, are you with this company?  Or are you also a person like myself, just giving your opinion?  I don't know who I'm talking to.
R:  Just giving my -- my opinion. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh okay. [LAUGH] I didn't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I thought -- we're being recorded then?
R:  Yes.
L:  Apparently, yeah.
R:  Yes, I -- I think the objective is to ah, our speech pattern and -- because it's the University of Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Ling- -- Linguistic Department, I think it is.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um.  Hm.  Well --
R:  My -- my [LAUGH] [inaudible] my -- my dialect is -- is a combination of a southern dialect and being born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. [LAUGH] 
L:  My -- mine's a combination of ah, growing up in -- in the South and also in Chicago, too, half my life, so -- but I'm in North Carolina now.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And having a star like Michael Jordan, you know, coming from this area, is something to be proud of and also living in the Chicago area.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, with Michael and um, of course, he -- he's probably on the golf course somewhere right now. [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  But he did receive his share of the dollars that was passing around the table --
L:  Yes he did.  Mhm, and then all the publicity and the -- the um, the contracts and, you know, the um, advertising that they do, like he did with Nike --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, so I mean, they make a lot of money.
R:  The tee-shirt companies. [LAUGH] 
L:  And that's what we pay for too, you know, those high prices.
R:  Yes.  Yes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, if -- if they could make an adjustment I would say decrease the salaries and decrease the price of the cost, you know, the cost factor of attending these games.  It's almost --
L:  Oh yeah.  The -- the prices -- to get into those games are outrageous.  One of us -- I mean, even to get season tickets, I mean, you -- you have to wait in line for [LAUGH] forever and then they're pretty much sold out, and then what I don't like is -- is, you know, living up in the Chicago area, I know what they do, they go out and one person'll buy two hundred tickets and it makes it hard for everybody else and they advertise in the paper and they sell them higher --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, all these high prices that they get.  I think that -- that should be against the law, which I'm sure it probably is, but um, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just think that's wrong, 'cause it doesn't give other people a fair chance to the -- you know, the good tickets, the cheaper --
R:  Right.  But the chances of um, the owners um, decreasing their profit margin to accommodate that is almost nil and none, so [LAUGH] --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's like a pipe dream, so --
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  -- if the owners are going to receive a lion's share of the money, then the players should receive a lion's share of the money.
L:  That's true.  I think they should.  Exactly, they own the team, the -- the team players are out there, you know, playing in the game, they should get, you know, I -- I don't think they're being overpaid so to speak, ah, I think that ah, you know --
R:  Well --
L:  -- considering what the owners are getting paid, I think that they're probably getting their partial shares.
R:  Yes, but I -- I think now it's coming to where there's still such a disparity in terms of the popular players and the one that's coming in.  The salary difference is such a big gap, I think they need to be more fair in that ah, that arena also.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because, um, the new players, they may pay 'em, um, you know, coming in five million dollars --
L:  Right.
R:  -- however um, the guys that are not popular, you know, they may -- then they tell them we have a salary cap, you know.
L:  Yeah.  Well personally, I don't really know how that all works and how they're paid as far as, you know, what percentages and all that that they do get paid.  I've heard of some of the high -- high salaries that some of the popular players get, you know, or some of the ones just coming in but I guess, you know --
R:  And the ones that are not so popular --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, they -- they have to play for like, a hundred or two hundred thousand dollars.
L:  Well hey, that's pretty good money too, huh?
R:  That -- that -- that's true.
L:  [LAUGH] [inaudible]
R:  But -- but if you're running down -- up and down the same court with somebody making five million and you're handling the same ball --
L:  That's true, yeah, that -- that right there would be, you know, wouldn't -- would seem -- if I was that person I'd probably would feel, you know, I'd feel cheated, but then again is the person making the five million making more points?  Are they making, you know, ah, are they making the game?  Are they -- are they the ones that are responsible for -- for winning most of the points, you know? 
R:  Yes.
L:  That's why they get paid on that scale, I would imagine.
R:  Mhm. [LAUGH] 
L:  Like Michael himself, you know. [LAUGH] He's always been my favorite, but of course he's retired now, and I didn't like what happened when um, the owner of the Bulls in Chicago sold the team.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Or when they cha- -- you know, uh, because we -- we -- I say "we" because I was in Chicago when we did like, ah, won all those championships, like three Petes[?] and ah, won five championships --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in the nineties --
R:  Oh okay.
L:  -- and ah, I just didn't -- I didn't like it, especially when we were in such a winning streak and then all of a sudden the owner just decides, hey, you know, ah, they just, you know, um what do you call it?  Um, selected new players the following year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And with Scotty Pippin and Michael left and -- and ah, Dennis, oh man, that just blew our mi- -- blew our minds over here. [LAUGH] They were playing so well, it's like you got a good thing going why would he would to just -- these managers or owners or whatever, why would they just want to, you know, play the cards like that?
R:  Mm.
L:  I just didn't understand it, and I mean --
R:  There's a method to their madness but we're not going to understand it.  What they do behind their corporate boardrooms.
L:  Yeah, in fact I don't even trust sometimes, these games.  I -- I feel like some of them are rigged.  I mean, for the money, because there's a lot of -- a lot of gambling going on out here.
R:  Yes, that's true.
L:  And people are, you know, a lot of bookies and in fact I know a person -- a couple of [LAUGH] a couple of bookies myself that -- that ah, place bets on every- -- every game, everything in existence and sometimes, just like with regular, ah, boxing, the same thing, I wonder if all this stuff could possibly be rigged because of money.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, it just seems like nothing's fair any more, like it used to be.
R:  The love of that money is the root of all evil.
L:  Yeah.
R:  The love of it, not the money. [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Them loving it.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's right.
R:  Mhm.  But this -- um, I think when the baseball had their -- had -- had their strike, um, I didn't get deep into it but, um, I don't think they should have striked though.
L:  Right, I -- I agree.  Um, I know, um, my son -- he's from Chicago, we live in the Carolinas now but he -- he's an, you know a real big fan of the Sox [LAUGH] the Sox, you know, and um, White Sox I guess it is, and that's all I hear, constantly about them playing and Sammy Sosa with the Cubs and all that and they think that, ah, he shouldn't have been, or has he in fact been ah, um, suspended because of that, ah, didn't they find, like, red or something in his bat, or something? Or 
R:  Oh, they -- they just gave um, I think they just suspended him for like, one or two games.
L:  Yeah.
R:  He's the breadwinner, so [LAUGH] they wasn't going to do too much.
L:  I think they're making enough money, I mean
