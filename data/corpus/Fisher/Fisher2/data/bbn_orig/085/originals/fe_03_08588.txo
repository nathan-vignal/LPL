L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  A- -- [LAUGH]
L:  Ah, my name's Lynne. [COUGH]
R:  Oh --
L:  I'm here in sh- --
R:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear what --
L:  I said my name is l- --
R:  Your name --
L:  -- Lynne.
R:  Lynne?
L:  Mhm.
R:  My name is Claire.
L:  Claire?
R:  Yes.
L:  Nice to meet ya.
R:  Nice to meet you.  Ah, it's my first time to do this phone call but I haven't --
L:  Me too.
R:  Oh, I see. [LAUGH] Okay.  A- -- h- have you understand -- have you understood the t- topic really well?  I couldn't hear it so clearly.
L:  I -- I had to listen real closely.  The topic is, um, ah, what do we think about, ah, the m- -- the Middle -- what -- the things going on in the Middle East and do we, um -- do we feel that peace will ever be achieved there?  It was --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- the only two things that I remember her saying.  She said 'em fast and, ah, it took ta- -- a few minutes for me to digest what she said 'cause she said it so quickly.  Um --
R:  I see.  Okay.  So, each -- ah, we have to talk about that for ten minutes, right?
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] All right.
L:  So, my -- my thoughts on the whole subject could probably fill all of one minute.
R:  M- -- hm.
L:  But I'm glad that -- I'm glad that, actually -- that we went over there and that we did what we did.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I think that -- that -- that maniac had -- and his sons had to be ousted.  They had to be gotten rid of.
R:  Right.
L:  Because of the inhumane things that they were doing to people.  I mean, Christ, you can't -- you can't treat people like that.  Well, of course, w- w- we in America, we think differently because we have all this liberty and freedom.
R:  Right.
L:  You know?  Well, over there, they didn't know any better.
R:  Mhm.  Well, what I think is, you know, it's -- it's o- -- I -- I mean, ah, are you republican?  Are you -- are you a supporter for republicans?
L:  I -- I'm neither.
R:  I see.
L:  I -- I always vote -- I always vote for the guy that I think is going to do the best job.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, so I'm -- I'm really not neither.  My -- my family is republican but that doesn't mean anything to me.
R:  I see.  Well, I'm a foreigner so I can't vote but I'm -- well, what I -- what Bush did, ah, in Middle East, I don't really agree with him.  But --
L:  No?
R:  It's, sort of, like you're, you know, y- -- an adult taking a child to -- in a back door and asking for money threat to him -- threatening him.  You know?  It's -- what can they do about it?  S- -- America's the biggest country and what -- they needed oil, I think.  And just -- it's -- well, all around the world, they cannot be against America because -- well, that's impossible, you know?  They have to be -- they have to agree to America.  So, on the other hand, while they complain a lot, for example, in Japan, they really complain a lot but they have to -- they have to be supporter for Bush.  Well, I don't know what [LAUGH] -- that's what I think.  And what -- what happens in the Middle East is that the really poor people, you know, and not the -- poor people die.  The women and child -- children, they die.  So -- I don't know.
L:  But -- okay.
R:  What do you think?
L:  I -- well, I a- -- yes.  P- people did die but [COUGH] look how many people Hussein and his -- and his army -- look how many people they murdered needlessly.  Needlessly.  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- they found thousands of -- of people in cardboard boxes and -- and, you know, ah, very shabby coffins and stuff that -- that belong to Iran.  They were Iran, um, [LIPSMACK] citizens and they were held -- they were a- -- held there and then they were executed after the first Gulf War.  I mean, this guy -- what he knew -- you know, he didn't -- he didn't care who he killed.  He just didn't care.
R:  That's right.
L:  I mean --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when you have to be so afraid of your -- of your government that you have to be afraid to open your mouth or --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, you know -- I -- I mean, I -- I just think that -- that in this -- in this day and age that there's -- there's no cost for the mistreatment of human beings.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think that everybody should -- should be allowed to have --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the right to say what they think or whatever, whether, y- you know, your government agrees with it or not.  I mean, i- -- this isn't a -- yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's --
L:  You know, it's -- w- --
R:  I see your point.
L:  You know what I'm saying?  It's not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- communism anymore.
R:  Yeah.  Of course.
L:  But --
R:  I see your point but, um, to me, it seems like the peace -- the peace it's -- only apparently it could happen but it's [SIGH] the religious war, you know?  What --
L:  I don't --
R:  -- happens --
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  -- in Middle East it's, like, never ending story.  So --
L:  Do well --
R:  I don't know.
L:  Y- -- our guys --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- are still getting killed over there.  I mean --
R:  Right.
L:  I'm very unhappy about that.
R:  That's right.
L:  But I don't think -- I don't think that Bush did it for the oil.  Honest to god, I don't.  I don't think he did it for the oil --
R:  Well -- oh, yeah.  Of course not.  But -- but --
L:  If he had --
R:  -- as a result, maybe. [LAUGH]
L:  -- we'd have been -- we'd be- -- if we had got- -- if it was for the oil thing, I think that he would've confiscated the fields and he didn't.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And he has always, um -- him and that other -- the general, I forget his name, he just retired -- Tommy Franks --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- they both stressed that the oil fields were to be preserved for the people -- for the people of Ir- Iraq.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I think that they did a pretty good job of doing that.  You know, it's too bad that all that looting went on and that they couldn't stop it, you know, ahead of time.  But the army and marines weren't there to be police.  They were there to oust the government.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so, you know -- so, the Iranian -- ah, I mean the Iraqi people lost a lot of their treasures and stuff --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- through that but I don't think that we -- that the United States can be held accountable for that because they weren't there to police it, they were just there to get rid of the government.  I -- at least, that's my impression.  I don't know.
R:  Right.
L:  I could be wrong.  I've been wrong before. [LAUGH]
R:  No.  I mean, he didn't -- he didn't do it for oil but I'm -- I'm just saying [SIGH] ...
L:  Well, we'll find out.  I guess we'll find out in a -- a -- a year or two.  Just -- no -- we'll see if we get any discounts on our oil, you know? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And that'll c- --
R:  Well, I'm from Korea and, you know, the situation between, ah, North Korea and South?
L:  Yeah.  I know.  It looks --
R:  And so --
L:  -- pretty serious.
R:  It's very serious and everybody's scared of that, um, whatever, Kim -- Jong Sung Kim.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, ah, well, we say the jokes, like, [LAUGH] Kim Jong Sung is -- is crazy and Bush is dumb. [LAUGH] Whatever.  I don't know. [LIPSMACK] It's just the --
L:  When w- w- --
R:  -- world is so crazy and I can't really -- I don't feel like I should participate in any party, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I don't feel like so attentive.  It's just so crazy to me.  And [LIPSMACK] -- well, of course, [SIGH] I'm so worried about Korea and all these war situation.  It's, like -- it seems like world is going peaceful because we are in peace in America but to people who are -- who are experiencing war right now, must be terrified.  You know?
L:  Abs- -- I can just imagine.  I -- you know, I can just imagine.  Y- y- you go back to the -- well, this is off the subject but you go back to the Vietnam era -- I don't know how old you are but when I was in high school, I mean, a- a- -- every day, somebody was crying because somebody in their family had died, you know?  And that --
R:  Oh, my god.
L:  And now you -- you --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- you see the, um -- the Vietnamese people that have come here and they tell you what a terrible thing that war was and how hard their life was and -- and, you know, they feel for the Iraqis because they know -- they know exactly what they're going through.  The post war, um, you know recovery and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and all that stuff.  But I think that if -- you know, if everybody t- together and they cooperate and, maybe, if the UN, kinda, keeps their nose out of it, I think that, um, ah, they will find peace there.  I think that the people there are already happier that the -- Hussein and his guerillas are out of there.
R:  Uh-huh.  Mhm.
L:  You know?  As far as -- as far as ruling the country.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I mean, a- -- w- -- and you -- you even saw it on TV, you know, the -- all the people were tearing down the statues and -- and, you know, jumping on 'em and spitting on 'em and slapping 'em with their shoes, which is a -- supposed to be a -- a, kind of, a ritual that, you know, is totally disrespectful.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, and -- and so, I don't think that anybody forced them to do that.  I think that they were genuinely feeling liberated, you know, at the time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.  I --
L:  It's --
R:  -- understand but -- you know, I understand that he's doing his best.  What can -- you know?  A- -- that's -- that -- that's why he's there for as a president.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But -- well, as -- as a one fu- -- human, you know, I'm -- I'm against war.  So --
L:  I am too.
R:  Like -- I don't know.  I -- maybe I'm hoping for nothing.  Maybe I'm hoping that, you know, in, like, um, Germany -- in Germany, you know, the, um, East and West got united in the --
L:  Right.
R:  -- year of ninety --
L:  They came together.
R:  -- ninety something, right?
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  I'm [SIGH] [LIPSMACK] -- well, in South Korea, people are hoping that's w- -- that far too, like, peaceful unification again.
L:  Well, we could --
R:  But --
L:  -- play for that but w- -- that guy is --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- kind of, a nut.
R:  Yeah.  Crazy nut.
L:  And --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, and -- and what will happen?  Will the United States go there to -- to a- -- help the South Koreans?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  Will they help?  Anyway, would you want them to?  Would you want them to come and help -- help you, you know, c- -- maintain your -- your, um, lifestyle and your -- your freedom and -- and all that, kinda, stuff?  Or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- would you feel the same way?  You know?  It's -- it's hard to tell.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  I -- I have never been in a war situation so I d- -- I d- don't know what those people are going through.  I can only imagine how horrifying it is to see your country blown to bits.  You know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  But --
L:  But --
R:  How do you predict the future in the Middle East?
L:  I think that they'll achieve peace but I think it's gonna take a long time.
R:  Yes.  Maybe forever.
L:  You know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Maybe.  W- -- I know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- something for sure, I know that, you know, they may get some type of democracy there but it will never be the same as, say, the United States because that would not fit into that region.  You know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that -- that would just -- it just would be so totally o- off the wall that they couldn't -- they couldn't possibly --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- adapt a- and -- and live life m- m- --
