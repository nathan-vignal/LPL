R:  Hi, I'm Larry.
L:  Hi, I'm Melba.
R:  How you doing Melba?
L:  Just fine.
R:  So, do you follow professional sports at all?
L:  Ah, no I don't, unfortunately not -- not that much.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I do but it's usually just baseball.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I don't follow much anything else any more.
L:  Yes.
R:  Do you, ah, well, I -- I  don't know, do -- do you have a- -- an opinion on ah, their topic, or ?
L:  Um, ah, well from my gathering it was whether they are paid too much or --
R:  Do they deserve their salaries.
L:  -- do they deserve their salary?  I think if their performance and um, their skills are -- are up to par, then I feel that they should be paid for, you know, what they do.
R:  Yeah, I -- I don't have a problem at all with them being rewarded for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- good performance.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But when it gets to the outrageous point -- I don't think it has anything to do with the player at that point.
L:  Right.
R:  All the player does is accept an offer.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know. [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Well, the whole --
R:  If there's a problem to be had, it's the people making the offer. [LAUGH] 
L:  That is true, because it's -- it's basically everything in this world is about money.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Money, money, money.  So, ah, there can be some extremes in -- in any of it, but like I said, I go back to if the person is um, you know, performing and -- and um, they should be compensated, I believe, for their talent.  But like you say, when it gets to the outrageous, now that's a different thing.
R:  Yeah.  What do you think when they go on strike?
L:  Um, you know, it's like everything else, like I say, it comes back to more money, more money, so [LAUGH] 
R:  It always seems to.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it's -- it -- be it sports or whatever it's -- it's always based on, ah, wanting more money, and I do feel that um, you know, like I said, they can get out of hand with it and that ah, there should be a guideline or a -- a point of drawing the line, you know, because everything, if you let it, can just get out of hand and get ridiculous.
R:  Yeah, I think that works on both sides.
L:  Yes.
R:  Yeah.  Because I mean, you're right, they've got to have something they can do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, even though, yeah, they may be making incredible money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, that -- that doesn't mean that there -- there's things that they should be -- you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- th- -- that they shouldn't have some standard, like you say, to work by.
L:  Yes, they should.  I really feel in all sports that they should.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It should be a -- a line drawn, you know, that they go so far and then that's it.  Because like I said, anything that man deals with can get out of -- out of hand and go to the extreme.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it can be on either part.
R:  Yeah.  Now I've heard this phrase before, and I think it pretty much carries over all sports --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is the contracts that they wind up with are generally rewards for past performance.
L:  Yes.
R:  More than an expected performance.
L:  Yes, that's true.
R:  Well, my home town team --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is the Texas Rangers.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we have the highest paid man in baseball.
L:  Mm.  Mhm.
R:  Well, ever since we've had him, and I think even the year before, the Rangers came in last.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Every year.  You know, there's some point where you'd like to see old Alex say, you know, "You know what?  Have some money back." [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You need to get somebody else.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  You never see that happen.
L:  No, you -- you won't, more than likely.  That will not take place. [LAUGH] 
R:  So what --
L:  But I think they have to remember these people are human beings, they're not gods and -- and you know, they have good days they have bad days, and it's -- it's -- it's really to me, dealing in reality because the expectation -- you -- it's an old saying, you know where you've been but you don't know where you're going.  They don't know, you know, injuries can occur, things can come up --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- and ah, you know, they're -- they're not gods, like I said, they're human beings and they -- they go through different things just like everybody else and one injury can -- can knock out a whole career, you know --
R:  That's right.  It could all end tomorrow.
L:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
R:  So, yeah, I generally don't have problems with the players.
L:  Right.
R:  If -- if there's a -- an amount or a contract that I'm unhappy with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- then direct it at who made the offer rather than the player.
L:  Right, right.
R:  I've seen a couple of players behave in manners I don't care to see --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- grown people [LAUGH] 
L:  I feel too, there should be -- there should be strict guide lines with that, because you're an athlete and you're worth a lot of money does not give you the right to -- to have inappropriate behavior.  I don't care who it is, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Like I say, because it comes back to they're human beings.  They're no different than anybody else.  If they break the law, if they do whatever or -- or have some type of behavior that's not unac- -- that's -- that's unacceptable I think they're accountable for it.  I don't care what their salary is.
R:  Yeah.  I like the fact I think sports is still growing and how it treats its players --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- because I know, for a while, you had players that were making, you know, just incredible sums of money --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and as soon as they were done they were broke.
L:  Right.
R:  And you finally have some trying to teach -- teach 'em how to handle their success.
L:  It -- it's overdue.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's overdue.
R:  Because a lot of these players, you know, that's all they had.
L:  Yes.
R:  Growing up, so you know, they come from very humble beginnings.
L:  Right.
R:  And all of a sudden they have the dreams of avarice.
L:  Have all this money.  Yes.
R:  So, it's easy to go nuts.
L:  Yeah it is.  And a lot of 'em, they -- they live ex- -- you know, they, to me, live extravagantly and -- and like I said, you must keep in mind that -- that this is going on now, but who's to say, you know, in the future what ah, is going to take place?  So they need to live and plan according to that because you could be up today and, you know, something, heaven forbid, happened that ah, you -- you know, you're no -- you're no longer able to perform and -- and all this money is not going to be coming in and you have to, you know, be in reality and -- and prepare for that.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.  Absolutely.
L:  And I think that people, you know, it's just like, ah, a religion to 'em.  Some of them are just so -- so ah, enthused and carried away with sports until I think they kind of lose focus on reality.
R:  I agree.
L:  And expect um, you know, just extreme things out of these people.  And like I said, you have to remember they're human beings, and there are things that happen.
R:  Yeah, I don't know if they're living their own dreams through someone else --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- you know, vicariously through others or --
L:  Yeah, a lot of people I think do.
R:  I think that's also where you wind up with, you know, the parents being, well, less than ah, sterling examples at little league and --
L:  Oh my god, because the last couple of examples I saw them brawling on the field --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and people getting beat up and hurt.  No, you know, that used to -- that -- that's not acceptable and there's no excuse for that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's not about sports.  That's about dysfunctional people.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That are going to see the sports.
R:  Well said.  Well said.
L:  Mhm.  And it's a poor example to set for children, you know.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If -- if your child is on a team and they don't get to bat or they lose a game it's no reason to go out and beat the crap out of somebody --
R:  No.
L:  -- and put 'em in the hospital and injure 'em and it -- it just -- it doesn't show a positive role model or image or inspiration to the kids.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah, and I know sports can be such a esteem building and character building, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it not only teaches you how to accept losses and how to deal with, you know, different people perform in different ways, but it also teaches you how -- how to be the winner.
L:  Yes.  Right.
R:  If it's done right, anyway.
L:  Yes that is true.  But they've come a long way, because now they've got um, the young ladies that are -- that have more opportunities than they ever had to participate in sports, so there has, to me, been some um, progress and -- and something coming out of it because it was kind of limited at one time.  There were just certain things that, ah, young ladies and women just weren't considered for when it comes to the world of -- of sports.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I feel like if they can um, do and -- and are up to their -- their potential, then they should be given the recognition and given a chance to, you know, do whatever it is they do.
R:  They should have the shot, yeah.
L:  Right.
R:  Well I think they've also worked at growing other sport's popularity.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, where it was mostly football, baseball, basketball --
L:  Baseball, yeah.
R:  -- then you have, you know, hockey has kind of grown --
L:  Mhm.  And I like hockey, believe it or not. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh yeah?  I think soccer has grown in the US.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh yes, soccer is -- is popular.  It's -- it's the sport.
R:  Yeah.  And ah, that's not exactly -- I don't know if you'd call them athletes, I mean I know it's physically enduring but --
L:  Mhm.  Yes it is.
R:  -- it seems like motor sports is -- is growing as well.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  That -- that's not an easy thing, but --
L:  No it's not.
R:  -- it's not the contact sport.
L:  I think too, a person has to -- it depends on their -- their mental psyche.  They've got to have a certain, you know, to be able to compete, um, with -- with, you know, restraint and -- and don't have extreme expectations and -- and know that there're -- there're certain limits and know that, like I said, there're going to be days that you may win and there are days that you won't, and a lot of it, you know, has to do with your psychological state of mind whether you're really ready for
