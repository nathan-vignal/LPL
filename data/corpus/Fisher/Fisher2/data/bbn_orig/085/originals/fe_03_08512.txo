R:  Grant.
L:  Shirley.  How are you?
R:  Hi.  I'm good.  You?  So --
L:  Fine.  I believe the topic today is how you feel about the high price that athletes are getting paid salaries.
R:  That, and ah, um, their strike and stuff.
L:  Oh, okay, I didn't hear that part.
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Georgia.
R:  Philadelphia.
L:  Philadelphia.
R:  So, wh- -- what kind of sports do you like?
L:  I like basketball.  I used to be a basketball player.
R:  Really?
L:  A long time ago.
R:  I like, ah, basketball and football.
L:  Really.
R:  And, ah, even though I think it's ridiculous how much they get paid, the truth of the matter is they get -- they're entertaining so many people that I don't -- it just wouldn't [inaudible] happier.
L:  I think they're -- they're way over paid too, even though they are entertain- -- like you say, even though they are entertaining, ah, we do pay the price to see 'em.  Which, still again [LAUGH] no-one -- no-one should make the kind of money they make, I don't think, for what they do.
R:  E- -- exactly.  I mean --
L:  Because it's for play- -- I mean they're -- I know it's hard work, just like our job is, but still, it -- it's a game.
R:  A, it's a game; B, there's people helping who are trying to cure cancer who aren't getting that money.
L:  Right.
R:  And -- but y- -- and they're living out their dreams.
L:  Right.
R:  Th- -- the people who are there aren't just like, oh, you know, maybe [inaudible] I want to become a professional athlete.  To them, it's, you know, all I wanted to do in my whole life was make the NBA --
L:  Right.
R:  Or make the WNBA and, like, I hate baseball.  A, it's too slow for me --
L:  Mhm.
R:  B, I can't stand, like, their egos, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Their, you know, "I made forty five million dollars, 'cause he's forty three", they would just take --
L:  Well you know as long as there's -- I don't go to ball games any more, I -- I quit going to ball games when the, um, Blades striked.  I haven't been to one since.
R:  Well, I -- I'm too young.  I don't remember anything about baseball, like i- -- it's lost its whole passion.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you know, basketball --
L:  But you know, as long as people will pay the price to see it, they can get that kind of money.
R:  Oh -- oh definitely.  And that's the thing, it -- it's a business and um, here we have Alan Ivorson, I don't know if your aware of what his whole thing -- are you?
L:  No, uh-huh.
R:  Well, he's -- he's good, but he's not as good as people make him out to be.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But will they get rid of him?  No, because he makes -- he sells tickets.
L:  Right.
R:  And do you know, he's -- the endorsements these guys are getting?  I- -- it's like -- it's like the rock stars now.  It's how many clothing designs and how many shoes can they get out this year and 
L:  It's all -- it's all a game in a game.
R:  Oh, definitely.  And then there's, ah, people you never see who are making huge money off these players.  You hear about it all the time, how they get screwed off from their money and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I just -- I love it though, you know.  Just 
L:  I'm -- I'm just --
R:  -- I'm a huge basketball fan, but their -- their salaries -- their 
L:  I'd like -- like to get a tenth of what they get.
R:  What?  Oh.
L:  I said, I'd like to get a -- maybe even a eighth of what they get.  I go to work every day, eight --
R:  Oh, I'm --
L:  -- work eight hours and make -- just make a living -- 
R:  -- will you excuse me one second?
L:  -- just make a living and that's it.
R:  Would you excuse me for one second?
L:  Sure.
R:  Sorry about that, got a call.
L:  That's okay.
R:  Um, y- -- um -- um -- [inaudible] 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- but don't -- only -- the thing I like about them getting paid so much, now this is -- this doesn't make up for anything we've just said, but their money when -- when, you know, when they're going out there and they're bleeding and they know they've already made these -- that -- that kind of money, that's when you know they're playing 'cause they love it and it's not just 
L:  They're doing it because they want to.
R:  Oh, oh, totally, you know --
L:  Just like you -- like me and you, we -- well I don't say like me and you for -- I work to make a living, they work -- work to see how much more they can get luxuries.
R:  They --
L:  I work to get my bills paid. [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I -- I think they work because out of love of it, some of them.  Not so much in baseball, but in basketball, you know, they're -- they're driving themselves on.
L:  Yeah, they -- you know they -- people say, too, well they get paid these high salaries because they may play a few games in sports and get hurt and never play again.  Well, I may be driving down the road and be in a wreck and never get to work again but, you know, where are -- where's my money going to come from?
R:  I -- I was just about to say something about that, like, you know, these -- they're -- they're making all that money but every time they get on the field and they're risking -- but -- there's nothing we --
L:  Y- -- you -- every time you walk out the door you're risking your life.  I mean, you know, you could fall out the --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- fall out the door and break your neck, so y- -- maybe -- I envy them, wished I can make that kind of money --
R:  Might as well make a few million dollars, don't it?  Might as well make a f- -- few million dollars breaking your neck.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But you know, there's nothing that they can do about it.  I was reading a, ah, book once.  You ever hear of Hornace[?] Wagner?
L:  No.
R:  Well I know he's some sports guy, and that -- where sport's players money starting going up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and people started making a few thousand, he said, "All I'll take is one thousand.  Anything else is too much."
L:  Oh.
R:  A- -- and he said that, "All I need is food to feed the table.  Why are you giving me so much more money when there's people -- when there's people outside my house asking for money?"  He didn't understand --
L:  He actually did that?
R:  -- y- -- yeah, he -- he -- but this was back when people were noble.
L:  Oh yeah.
R:  He -- he -- didn't understand why he, who was going out there playing a game, was getting a thousand dollars when he -- when -- originally he was making, like, five hundred --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he was real content with that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, like, he -- what he said was, on his way from the ball park, he goes -- he'd go down to the supermarket, he'd grab a -- a banana on the way back, hook up an apple, like, that made him happy.  Th- -- that was his meal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But what he loved to do was play baseball.  And he also wasn't willing to be, ah, sponsored by tobacco companies.
L:  Well --
R:  You never see that any more.
L:  No, they -- they -- nowadays, anything you often think they can make more money they going to jump on that wagon.
R:  Oh t- --
L:  Like I say, maybe it's just because we don't have these opportunities and if we did we may have a different frame of mind about it, I don't know.
R:  I -- I -- I don't think anybody in this world, if they said play a game you love and get this much money would complain.
L:  No, I don't either.
R:  You know.  Wh- -- what would you say?
L:  If it's given to them they're not going to turn it down.
R:  Oh, of course not.  And they know they can't defend themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, all these Hollywood stars who are complaining about the environment and all this, look what you -- look how pampered you are.
L:  Mm.
R:  But, you see that Champion commercial?
L:  Yeah.
R:  It was, "We're the real champions," and it showed the people playing basketball in the street and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then they showed the, ah -- my favorite part of it was where they had the dollar -- the dollar bill in the middle of the ring.
L:  Mm.
R:  Like that was the ring stage.  You know, I think that says something.  But that -- but then you look at it again, that's an endorsement.  That's a commercial for a company, is about we're the real champions, the ones you are playing.
L:  Mhm.  That's right.
R:  [SIGH] I think it's a little -- I don't think it's a re- -- a little ridiculous.  I think it is ridiculous.  But there's nothing anybody here can do about it.  Almost that kind of money just doesn't exist any more.
L:  I wonder what
