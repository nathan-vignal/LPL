L:  Polly Misser[?].
R:  Hi.  It's, uh, Vikas here.  Hi, how are you doing?
L:  Fine.
R:  Yeah.  Uh --
L:  I'm sorry, I -- I'm -- um, I don't understand.  I've been getting these University of Pennsylvania phone calls a lot.  I don't know who the participant is.
R:  Uh, I'm Vikas.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh, I'm a student at MSU --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, do you know the topic?  The topic is airport security.
L:  Yes.
R:  So, what are you -- what is your idea about the airport security against terrorism in the United States?  What do you think about it --
L:  I think.
R:  -- at the moment?
L:  I mean, I think it's doing fine.
R:  Mm, I don't so.  Like, at the moment, like, okay, you check everybody, every person during the check in, like it's okay but even if somebody can -- like, uh, there's no thing by which you can ensure that nobody can go in without weapons.  Like, what I think that there should be a cop inside the plane everytime when the plane board, like, because somebody has to be there if some incident came on so somebody has to be there to take over those areas.
L:  I think that there are US marshals on the flights --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- who sit in business class, second to the row -- you know, and it's --
R:  Uh, now that there are air marshals in -- I don't think so, you know, you understood there are air marshals or not?
L:  There are now, now there is after nine eleven.
R:  No, I -- I -- I get -- I board -- I came here in January from international flight, there was no air marshal in the flight, there was nothing like that.
L:  I mean, they're not wearing uniforms, they're clothed --
R:  Okay.
L: -- they're plain clothed.
R:  Okay, so, okay maybe I -- I was not aware that like in my -- I'm from -- basically from India --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- so in my country they've started this thing, like in every domestic or international flight there are two air marshals in the plane so that they come over the terrorists.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was not aware of the United States so, yeah, that's, like -- and that --
L:  No, they have it in the United States, especially in certain countries, and if you're flying into Washington National Airport --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for the first thirty minutes that you're flying out or flying into the airport you can't even leave your seat.
R:  Oh, yeah, yeah, you know --
L:  So --
R:  Like, yeah, I think so, like, air marshal is the best thing by which we can ensure that there -- there would not be any terrorist activities.  But if -- if somebody came in with weapon then there's no mean by which you can stop him because he has weapon and he can do anything what he wants.
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah, so I think so now, it's okay. [LAUGH] So, anything else which you can contribute?
L:  No, I -- now, is this for a program?  I mean, is this for your -- are you in graduate school?
R:  Yeah, I am in graduate school.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, uh, I --
L:  And then is this for a class for school?
R:  Uh, no, actually I just got, uh, some -- some friend told me that there is a kind of program [inaudible] so this -- this [inaudible] will bring some kind of interaction program so I just want to participate in that so that's why I called.
L:  Sure, sure.  I don't understand, like somehow my name got on the list --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and I get these phone calls all the time --
R:  Okay. [LAUGH]
L:  -- but I've never had an opportunity to actually speak with someone so --
R:  Okay.
L:  So I did -- I can't understand why, like, five times a day I get a call from --
R:  Okay, I -- I don't know, like --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I -- I, uh, told them to add my name, I don't know how you got that.
L:  Okay.
R:  Maybe somebody add that, okay.
L:  Okay.
R:  Anything ...?
L:  No, I really don't have much more to add, I mean ...
R:  [SIGH] How frequently you take, like, flights?
L:  Um, I probably travel -- it -- it varies but, you know, sometimes six to twenty times a year.
R:  Okay, like, that --
L:  I -- I travel a lot for my work.
R:  Okay, that's pretty much like -- but that is whenev- -- whenever I travel I feel scary after that September eleven because whenever -- like [LAUGH] somebody stand up so I feel that it -- it can be a terrorist, like -- like, after September eleven it's, like, very scary flying in planes.
L:  Do you find yourself being targeted because you're Indian?
R:  Uh, sorry?
L:  In terms of, like, for the -- um, I mean, how often do you travel?
R:  Like, same, like not that much, like five or six times in a year because I'm a student, I'm -- I'm not -- I don't travel for the business purpose, I travel just to, uh -- for meeting --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- my friends or, uh, for the family members or for the [inaudible].
L:  Right.
R:  I don't travel that much but still, like, after September eleven I feel that I'm -- like, I feel scary at least. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  But you don't feel that you get pulled over -- I mean, there's -- they do random checks of people, like, you know.
R:  Yeah, but because, uh, like, uh, the terrorists, uh, they -- they say that -- or somehow, like, the guys who did that, uh, September eleven --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- according to them that India and, uh, United States, these are the two main targets of them because they are opposing the India also.
L:  Oh.
R:  Uh, uh, are you aware of that or not?
L:  No, I wasn't aware of that.
R:  Like, you -- you read some articles, like [inaudible] like [inaudible] yeah, the main target of these -- this people is, like, India and the United States because -- I don't know why so they keep on doing some kind of a terrorist activities in India also.
L:  Hm.
R:  So after September eleven, like, still there is no such kind of incidents in India like September eleven but still there are some different kind, like simple bomb blasting, ground bomb blastings keep on going on in all country.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But after September eleven, like, we increased our air security also but still, like, I feel sometimes scary that somebody stand up and, like, so ... [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  You have to be careful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [MN]
R:  And you, too. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R:  Okay, and I think -- and I think [LAUGH] -- I think you should speak also. [LAUGH]
L:  Pardon me?
R:  Uh, you should also speak something.
L:  Oh, I -- uh, you know, I guess I wasn't really aware of what this -- what this thing was about so I -- maybe I don't.
R:  Okay, so [LAUGH] actually I was not aware also.  I just know that we have, like, uh, I have to speak to somebody and I like to speak some -- somebody, some strangers because I think, like, that's the -- that is the best way to get something.
L:  Right.
R:  So that's why I enrolled in this thing.  Okay, so I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- still lots of time is left.
L:  Right.  Uh, we have to talk for ten minutes, I mean, we can't --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- end this earlier?
R:  Uh, I think that we have to because it's their study, if we end it, like, they can't analyze all talk so we should.
L:  So someone is analyzing our -- so is someone also listening to what we're saying?
R:  Uh, they are recording it for analyzing the how strangers behave in front of, like, when we -- when some strangers came across, so how they communicate their informations and their views and all this stuff.
L:  Oh, that's very interesting.
R:  So for that they are being -- doing this study.
L:  Hm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's very fascinating.
R:  Um, my first name is Vikas, V.I.K.A.S.
L:  Vikas.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, my name is Polly.
R:  Yeah, yeah, good.
L:  I'm actually Indian, as well.
R:  Sorry?
L:  I'm also Indian.
R:  You are also an Indian?  How means?  I don't know.
L:  I'm from -- I'm from UP, Lucknow.
R:  You're from Lucknow?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Like --
L:  My -- my family is from there.
R:  Okay, like, you, uh, born in United States?
L:  No, I was born in India --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- but, um, I came here --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a long time ago so --
R:  Okay, yeah, okay.
L:  So ...
R:  That's great. [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  I thought, like, your accent was completely American so I thought that --
L:  [MN] No, no, no, I have an -- I mean, I -- I go back occasionally but [COUGH] you know, my Hindi's not very good. [LAUGH]
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] But still --
L:  What part are you from?
R:  Uh, sorry?
L:  Where -- what part of India are you from?
R:  Yeah, I'm been -- I'm from Rajasthan, Jaipur.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  Okay. [LAUGH] And normally, like, uh, even you don't know Hindi, even when, like -- if there's some Indian guy speaks, you -- you can, uh -- 'cause -- you can definitely distinguish, like the accent is completely different, Indian English and, uh, American English.
L:  Right.
R:  So, like [LAUGH] your accent was completely American, maybe you are --
L:  Right.
R:  -- trying or maybe you have so, like, that's great. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  Like I tried so many times to make, you know, American accent but I can't [LAUGH]
L:  No, no, no.  I mean, it -- it'll -- it's good to have a little bit of an accent, something a little bit different, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  There's nothing wrong with that. [SIGH]
R:  Yeah, sometimes people don't understand what you speak because your accent is different, even you speak right, even then they can't understand because you are speaking in Indian accent.
L:  Right, well I mean --
R:  And have you ever been in India after that?
L:  Yeah, um, gosh, uh, last time I went was in nineteen ninety six.
R:  Oh, that's long [LAUGH] -- long back. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, but, you know, my family goes back -- my parents and --
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, go back once a year at least.
R:  Okay, okay.  So you work somewhere or you are a student?
L:  No, I'm not a student, I work in Washington DC.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  And that's where I live right now.

L:  So, I mean, I'd like to go back again sometime soon but, you know ...
R:  Mm.
L:  And I still have cousins in India, so, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's definitely help, okay.  Like, that's a big problem in, uh, like, uh -- you are, like -- you feel alone over here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At -- at least I feel.
L:  You don't have any family?
R:  Uh, no I -- I don't have anybody in United States.  I'm the only person in my family.
L:  Oh, that must be tough.
R:  Yeah, I came here for study only so --
L:  And then you're going to go back?
R:  Yeah, I will go.
L:  Oh, you definitely want to go back?
R:  Uh, yeah, I would like to go back because I have everything in my country so I don't want to stay away.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] Like, it's --
L:  Um --
R:  Like, uh, the country is great, like, you know, this is great, like, it's -- uh, like, everything is great but still, like, you have something which you miss, I don't know.
L:  Right.
R:  [inaudible]
L:  No, it just seems like a lot of people, um, who come here, I mean, they come here to stay, to immigrate --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- not to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  Not to, um, go back to their own country --
R:  Yeah, normally they don't --
L:  -- you know, just for studies.
R:  -- go back because, uh, like you know opportunities are so much over here.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's not, uh -- that's not the case in India.  Like, you have to fight for everything but still, like, [LAUGH] I don't know, I feel different.
