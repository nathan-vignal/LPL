R:  Hello --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- my name is Brenda.
L:  Hi, this is Julie.
R:  Hi Julie.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [SIGH] Um, [SIGH] well, I don't -- I don't re- -- yeah, I believe that the players get way -- paid way too much [LAUGH].
L:  Oh, yeah, yeah, me too.
R:  Way too much.
L:  But, you know, that -- unless somebody's gonna come along and lower the money they're just gonna keep wanting more and more money, and --
R:  Exac- -- yeah, exactly, so I -- you know, [LIPSMACK] if I knew of a way to do it, I'd probably be on that petition, or ... [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  A survey, or so forth, 'cause it's like [SIGH] they get way, gosh, too much money and then they spend it on frivolous things.
L:  Yeah, or [LAUGH] lawsuits, and [LAUGH] paternity cases, and --
R:  Right, and then --
L:  -- drug arrests, and [LAUGH] whatever.
R:  And I'm su- sure they would take care of their money better if they didn't have as much [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, yeah, that's probably true --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, you know, and a lot of 'em can, you know, endorse shoes, or be on cereal boxes, or have a talk show, or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, so, you can -- when their career's over they still have a career.
R:  Exactly, right.
L:  [SIGH]
R:  The only thing I -- I do like the ones that -- the athletes that do put back money into charities and things like that.
L:  Oh, yeah -- yeah, and -- and --
R:  They have still have plenty of money left over.
L:  Yes, but then, you know, it's a -- they try to balance out I guess, the other ones that [LAUGH] give athletes a bad name, but, they're the ones that get the most publicity.
R:  Mhm, yeah, that's true.
L:  But, you know, if it -- like, the whole team decides that they should have more money, then, I guess, you know ...
R:  Yeah, I guess [several inaudible words] --
L:  Well, and -- and, you know, the -- the people who own the teams are making a lot of money, too.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, I guess, you know, they figure them -- those people are making money and they're not even doing the work [LAUGH].
R:  Yeah, except [several inaudible words] -- where does that money come from?  Is it all from advertising and marketing, or, you know, are we going into the red, into the deficit because they're -- they are paying them so much?  I mean, exactly where is all this money actually coming from?
L:  Yeah, that's a good question [LAUGH].  Ah, I don't know that [LAUGH], you know, I think, like, the -- the one -- the guys who bought that horse, like -- like --
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  -- like, they all chipped in money and bought the horse, but the horse doesn't get any money [LAUGH].
R:  True, yeah, I hope they take care of him really well [LAUGH].
L:  You know, so ...
R:  [SIGH]
L:  I don't know, I mean, when they stick these topics in, it's like, um, um, I don't know [LAUGH].
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, you know, I -- I -- I don't think they need to go on strike, but ... I think it's --
R:  [SIGH] Oh, jeeze, no [SIGH], but ...
L:  You know, but I guess they're not all gonna say, "Well, gee, we'll -- we'll take a hundred thousand dollar pay cut this year, and be happy with that". [LAUGH]
R:  Mm, yeah.
L:  I think they -- they --
R:  But, somebody's [inaudible] make the mandatory -- mandatory rules 'cause, [SIGH] I mean, it's like, even in leg- +legislation and politics and stuff where [inaudible] they -- if budget cuts and everything [MN] that's not even fair, because they'll, like, lower benefits or raise taxes --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they keep their salaries the same.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, it's like, okay, um [LAUGH] ...
L:  Yeah, I -- I definitely agree with that, that there should be some kind of, like --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- maximum cap on it, or whatever they call it, and, you know --
R:  Right --
L:  -- when you --
R:  -- and then put the money to something else, or you know, put -- [SIGH] instead of having the athletes put the money to charities, maybe, [SIGH] if there is money left over, give that to charities --
L:  Yeah, that's a good idea.
R:  -- and, like, give the sports a better name [MN].
L:  Yeah, that's definitely a good idea.
R:  Or, to the needy or [inaudible] with that -- that -- they're -- they're -- it oughtn't be any -- any welfare or, um, starving children or anything like that in this country with all that money floating around.
L:  Yeah, oh, I totally agree with that, I mean, when you --
R:  That's just ridiculous.
L:  -- see, like, their houses, and you know, their cars and everything that they have --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, and it's like, well, you really don't need five Porsches do you?  You know, could you like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- donate the money for one Porsche to [LAUGH] -- would, like, feed a hun- -- all these people, just, if you sold one Porsche --
R:  Yeah, yeah --
L:  -- you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I just -- I don't understand that at all -- it just baffles me.
L:  And I'm -- you know, I just [LAUGH] [MN] -- when I think of so many other jobs that people have, that they make hardly any money for, you know, what they do --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and [LAUGH], you know, and then --
R:  Oh, I know, people work, like [MN] eighty, a hundred hours a week [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and ma- -- just to get by.
L:  Yeah, and you know, [MN] here's these g- -- you know, I don't know, I guess [MN] it'd be interesting to what men -- men's opinion would be, 'cause they probably think that the guys deserve --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to have the money, I don't know, but, you know, I guess we'll -- and -- and, you know, then on the other side of the coin, you know, women -- women's sports, like, womens professional basketball players, I know, they don't make near as much money as the men do, and, [MN] you know, I don't know how those women w- -- you know, if they think that they deserve as much money as the men do.
R:  Mm.
L:  That -- I guess that's a different kind of topic, but, you know, it's -- it's -- it's --
R:  Yeah, [inaudible] I'd imagine they -- they will, because they -- people that are like in regular jobs, they fight because men have the top positions --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and they want --
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  -- the women to.
L:  Yeah, so I guess there's not anything -- it's not much different for whatever -- whatever occupation you have.
R:  Mhm, yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I don't think there'd be, you know, much difference -- it --
L:  I mean, and --
R:  -- that is a shame why men get paid more than -- than women, but ...
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] -- yeah, when the women do most of the work, and [LAUGH] ...
R:  Yeah, and [MN] I -- I believe the women might have even a -- a greater chance of being injured because they might not be able to have children anymore, well, I guess the men could get a -- go, yeah, that can go both ways though.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, yeah [LAUGH] -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- yeah, but they -- they have [MN], you know, ways to protect themselves, and ... [LAUGH] 
R:  True, yeah, and I don't really think there is anything like that for the women.
L:  No, I don't know --
R:  Yeah, I have -- that's a good --
L:  -- that's a -- that's a good question [inaudible] --
R:  Yeah, that's a good one.
L:  It's, like, that'll be, like, the new -- the new lawsuits is like, women athletes suing because they have injuries and ...
R:  Uh-huh, yeah, their ovaries or abdominal muscles or something got injured, and --
L:  Yeah, [inaudible] --
R:  -- [SIGH] ahah, I haven't heard of that one yet.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mm mm, no that's a --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- that's a good point, so, they're -- they should -- they have, I don't know, I guess that would be like, workmen's comp or something [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I wonder if they even get that if they -- if they [SIGH] are required to get their own or -- no, I'm -- I'm sure it's all -- all provided 'cause they --
L:  I don't know --
R:  -- have those emergency teams, and --
L:  -- well, yeah, and -- who knows, but, ah, yeah, but that's a good --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- thing to think about.
R:  Wow, hm.
L:  I just, you know, I think they're just way overpaid, and --
R:  [LIPSMACK] 
L:  -- you know, if they think they don't make enough money then they should just go boo hoo to somebody else [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm, definitely, yeah -- oh, yeah, 'cause you hear that a lot of times -- they wanna transfer to another team, 'cause they offered 'em more money, and ...
L:  Yeah, yeah, I don't think there's much, I don't know -- loyalty in, you know, it's like, "Well, I'm with this team, but then next year I'm gonna go with that team, 'cause I'll make more money", and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- well, and then, you know, you have the guys that don't do too well, and they end up going to the teams that make less money [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH] Right.
L:  And, they're getting traded, and [MN] you know -- I don't --
R:  Yeah, I'd have more respect for sports if there was more loyalty versus just going out for the -- going money.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and it -- and then, you know, even like, somebody like -- like, golfers, yeah, they make a lot of money -- [MN] the ones that are good, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just for hitting a ball in a hole.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, they -- they charge a lot too, to -- to learner for the lessons.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  They charge a -- oh ...
L:  Yeah, because those are the guys who make the most money --
R:  -- gosh. 
L:  -- is like, the golf pros -- the teachers that teach it [LAUGH] -- [several inaudible words] ...
R:  Ah, it's amazing, it's like, "You want how much -- what?" [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah [LAUGH] -- to -- to do this?
R:  I have to make kind of like -- the kind of money you do, in order to afford it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, yeah, teach me how to be a golfer [LAUGH].
R:  [SIGH] Ah, so, it's like wow -- 
L:  Yeah, and [inaudible] --
R:  -- like the ten thousand dollar swing, or something.
L:  Yeah, really, [LAUGH] and -- and meanwhile, they're not even professional golfers, they're just teachers [LAUGH].
R:  Mhm, they're probably teachers because they couldn't make it on the pro circuit [LAUGH].
L:  Yeah, but --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- but, I bet some of them make more money than, like, the professional golfers who don't do very well, and they don't -- they don't win, and they don't make the big bucks, but meanwhile the golf pros are making money, like, every single day --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] hours of dollars a hour [LAUGH], for golf lessons --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- but, I don't think golfers ever go on strike ... [several inaudible words] 
R:  Yeah, I haven't heard of that.
L:  I guess it's also like baseball and football, and, like, those big team sports, 'cause -- I don't know -- I don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the other -- like, golf doesn't have a team, and tennis, and, so they can't really go on strike.
R:  [SIGH] Sure, yeah, it'd be just their indi- [several inaudible words] individual people.
L:  But I mean, you know, if like, one person wanted to go on strike, it'd be like, "Okay, that's fine" --
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- the rest of us will win then, and [LAUGH] --
R:  [MN] Yeah, [inaudible] [LAUGH] -- yeah, I don't -- I just don't understand why -- why they -- they do that -- the -- the striking and the -- [inaudible] with all the money they make, and ...
L:  Yeah, really -- they should just --
R:  -- just because of a little [inaudible] here or there, or a [SIGH] [MN] -- most of 'em want a pay increase or something.
L:  Yeah [LAUGH].
R:  Hm.
L:  Or more days off, or whatever -- first class plane tickets instead of ...
