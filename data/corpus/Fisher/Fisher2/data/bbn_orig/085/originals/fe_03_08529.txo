L:  [NOISE] Hello, this is Chris.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hello. Um, what was the topic again? [NOISE]
R:  What?
L:  [NOISE] What was the topic again?
R:  Um, do you think, uh, athletes deserve the high salaries?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, okay.  Well, first of all --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- who am I speaking with?  This is Chris.
R:  Uh, this is Jennifer.
L:  Where are you from?
R:  Hi.
L:  No, where are you from?
R:  Oh, uh, um, I'm from New York.
L:  Oh wow, they did -- send us all the way over there.  I'm over in LA.
R:  Oh wow. [LAUGH] That's nice.
L:  Okay, so, how old are you?
R:  I'm twenty.  How are you?  How about you?
L:  Twenty three.
R:  Oh, okay, so we're about the same.
L:  Okay, so they want to know if, uh -- wait, wait, is -- is this for real that you really get money for this?
R:  Am I what?
L:  Do you really get money for doing this?
R:  Mike for dinner?
L:  No, do you really get money for doing this?
R:  I have no clue.
L:  Okay.  Anyways, I -- I'm a fresher, too, so I hope I get the money.  So do, uh, professional athletes deserve expensive salaries?  No, I don't think so.
R:  Uh --
L:  What do you think?
R:  I -- I don't know, I -- I think, like, I don't know, they're lucky so --
L:  Well, I mean, look at Kobe right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Kobe's making like what, like a hundred thousand a day.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I mean, come on, it's ridiculous. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, if -- if -- if he doesn't get it then who is, uh, his managers?
L:  Well, I mean, it's just everything is -- is over -- over paid, like they pay everyone so much then --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I think it's just a ridiculous amount of money.
R:  But the thing is that --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like, who -- who'd -- who will get the money?  Like, all that money who will it filter to if he doesn't get it, if the bat -- if the sports player doesn't get it?
L:  Oh, charities or something like that.
R:  What, insurance?
L:  Charit- -- charities.
R:  Charities?
L:  Something like that.
R:  Oh, I doubt that -- I doubt corporations give to charities, you know. [LAUGH] You know --
L:  I don't know, what -- where does all that money really come from?  I mean --
R:  All the people who watch sports --
L:  Well, why Kobe --
R:  -- on TV.
L:  I mean, Kobe gets paid so much more than, like, another basketball player in his team.  Like, I know he's the best player, I mean --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- he gets paid like ninety percent more.
R:  Because -- because he brings popularity to the team, I guess, I should think.  I don't know.  I don't know --
L:  Yeah --
R:  -- very much about sports.
L:  Me neither, I -- I hate sports, I can't stand them.
R:  Yeah.  I -- 
L:  [several inaudible words]
R:  I don't watch sports but, like, I don't know, I guess if you're -- if you were born lucky, you -- you were born with talent then you -- you get -- you get to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- go through life kind of like, you know [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Kind of lucky, I guess. [LAUGH]
L:  So, you don't play a sport?
R:  No -- no, not really, I don't really play sports.
L:  Oh, you -- you just sit on your butt and watch TV?  No, I'm joking.
R:  No, no, no, no, no.  I -- I read, I read a lot.  But, um, I don't know, I think like if -- if you make it to that point you deserve all that money.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, but he -- he's like, what, twenty years old making, like, a hundred thousand each -- every month [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or whatever.  That's just common[?].
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's just [inaudible] money.
R:  But if you were his friend that would be nice.
L:  Oh yeah, huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That -- that would be the best thing in the world --
R:  Or a family member, yes.
L:  -- [several inaudible words]
R:  I don't know.
L:  I don't really know what I'd do with that much money.  I mean, I'm pretty well off, myself.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [MN]
R:  What do you do?
L:  I own my own company.
R:  You what?
L:  I own my own company.
R:  Oh, okay, nice.
L:  Yeah, I -- I -- I do advertising for Fortune five hundred companies.
R:  Oh, wow, okay.  So -- so you don't -- you don't have to be jealous of Kobe. [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not -- I wouldn't say jealous is the word.
R:  I mean, you know --
L:  No, I just -- I don't think that athletes should get paid so, so much, I mean, [NOISE] I don't know, I -- I just wonder where -- where all the money comes from and where it all really goes.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know, I guess, it just all comes from the people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and -- who watch it, just --
L:  Well, then why does go it directly to the players so much?  I mean, why not as much to the manager or the producer or the -- the team itself, I mean --
R:  I don't know.
L:  -- or distribute to the -- throughout the team?
R:  Um, I don't know.  I -- I -- they probably negotiate, they probably say -- they probably say, "Oh well" --
L:  [NOISE] You know a lot of the --
R:  Because, uh -- hello?
L:  A lot of money comes from, um, advertising.  Like if Kobe's wearing some brand new Air Jordans --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- then he's going -- and if he wins --
R:  Bring money, right?
L:  -- he's number one.  Yeah, if he's number one, are they going to buy the Air Jordans or they going to buy the -- the Reeboks that [NOISE] whatever is running in, the [inaudible] if -- if -- if he's on, you know what I mean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  They're going to pick the product that's with the winners --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and that's when -- that's when Nike signed the contract with Kobe saying, "Look, if you wear these shoes, we'll give you a hundred thousand dollars a month".  That's how -- where all the money comes from.
R:  He gets money from everywhere. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, he gets --
R:  Well, you're popular when you're a celebrity, like everyone wants you, I guess, and --
L:  Even the comm- -- even TV commercials.  Like you know TV commercials, um, it cost ten thousand dollars a second to run on the air. [NOISE]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Don't know if you realize that but [NOISE] --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- lot of money out in there in advertising, especially I know that because I do ads myself.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's my business.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah, I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't mind but I guess that's why, uh, people crave like --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- celebrity status, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- 'cause they're going to earn -- they can demand that because people want them.
L:  [NOISE] You think it's worth it?  I mean, if you have the -- if you have the skill that you know you can do to become --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that type of person with that kind of money, would you -- would you do it?
R:  If it's for the taking I would do it.
L:  For the what?
R:  Taking.
L:  Yeah, that's true.
R:  I mean -- I mean, anyone wants as much money as they can get.
L:  So, what's your goal to get money like that?
R:  It's what?
L:  What's your goal in life to get money like that?
R:  Huh.
L:  What's your goal to get money like that?
R:  What's my goal?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I have no clue.  Right now I'm just like a waitress, you know --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- a waitress and kind of -- I don't know, I -- I -- I don't know, I think I want to do art but, you know, I'm indecisive.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I guess some people who know what they want to will make money, you know.
L:  [NOISE] Hm. [MN]
R:  Like they can go for it but I --
L:  I used to get a little bit of moneys from, um -- from mountain biking, I -- I race mountain bikes.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Oh, you -- you -- you've heard of Fox, right?
R:  I was into what?
L:  [NOISE] Have you heard of Fox racing? [NOISE]
R:  No, what is it?
L:  You -- you never heard of the Fox brand, [NOISE] Fox brand, like, have you -- have you ever been to Pacific Sunwear?
R:  Uh, [MN] I -- I went in really quick and left. [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  I went really -- I went really quick inside and then left because --
L:  Oh, well they have a lot of shit[?] called Fox and -- and they make motorcycle and bicycle racing equipment and uniforms and, um [NOISE] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I got a contract with them where if I wear there clothes while I race and if I win --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I get a lot of mon- -- and X amount of dollars. [NOISE]
R:  Oh wow, that's cool.
L:  Same thing with Kobe and all them other athletes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh, most of the money doesn't really come from the game itself, it comes from the advertising --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and who they are.
R:  Yeah, well, huh, I don't know, I should -- I -- I guess, to go back to the subject, I -- I guess they deserve --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like you don't think they deserve it just 'cause it's just --
L:  I mean, they deserve a lot of money but, I mean, think about it, they're making, like, two thousand dollars a second out there.
R:  But --
L:  I mean -- I mean, why -- why in the hell does he -- does Nike even go up to him and say, "We're going to give you a hundred thousand dollars every month if you wear these shoes"?  I mean --
R:  'Cause --
L:  -- where do they come with that figure?  A hundred thousand dollar a month, "Oh, wear our shoes".
R:  'Cause they --
L:  Imagine your mom --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- coming up to you, "Oh, wear this and I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars a month".  Shit, I'd walk out naked every -- every day for a hundred thousand a month.
R:  I think because --
L:  I -- and --
R:  Oh, overtime, they would make even more, you know, developing their brand names --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Reinforcing it, like, with the star players, that's what they represent, they represent, like --
L:  And I just think that's a really stupid starting price.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean --
R:  Well, they have that money, is the thing.
L:  I'd put dog shit on top of my head [NOISE] for ten thousand a month. [NOISE]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, would you do that?  So, if they were to say, "Every day you wake up, put a piece of dog shit on your head --"
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  "-- and walk around for one month, every day for thirty days and at the end of the month we'll give you ten thousand dollars".  Would you do it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, shit, "Oh, okay, I'll -- I'll wear dog shit for the whole day".
R:  But no one cares about everyday people.
L:  Yeah, it's just -- it's just weird how they -- they -- but -- and, you know a lot of these guys, like, they'll even say no.  They may come to 'em -- like, they may come up to Kobe or someone else, like Shaq, and say, "Do this for -- for a hundred thousand dollars" and they'll be like, "No, that's not -- that's not enough.  We need -- I need more".  What the fuck is that?  Oh, you need more money?  You, like --
R:  That's negotiation, right.
L:  I know but, like, where do they start?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, where are their minds?  Had it crossed their minds where, like, money's just like [NOISE] nothing but a game?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  It -- it -- it's like I can just picture them saying, [NOISE] "No, I cannot wear your shoes for a hundred thousand dollars".
R:  Mhm.
L:  "That's not enough money".
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's not -- it's not -- it's just like them, it's not that hard wearing your shoes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'd wear my mom's panties for a hundred thousand, I mean, they -- I mean, these guys will, like, want -- demand five hundred thousand.  Like, what the hell does he need the money? [NOISE] Why's he been asking his company for that money because, [NOISE] I mean, I know they can but [NOISE] hell, it's just weird.
R:  Are you outside?
L:  These guys -- huh?
R:  I just heard a plane. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that was a helicopter.  I'm in LA.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know how the -- you know the crime is, you know, they -- they're out looking for bad guys.
R:  Really? [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, he had the spotlight on and everything.  I'm at Starbuck's right now.
R:  You're at Starbuck's.
L:  Yeah.
R:  At, like, what -- what time is it?  Like, ten?
L:  Uh, yeah, ten o'clock.
R:  Wow.
L:  They're just closing.
R:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]
L:  But, um, as for -- what were we trying to say, I for --
