L:  Hello?
R:  Hello?  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Holly.
R:  Hi.  I'm Tracey.
L:  Nice to meet you.
R:  That's funny -- I have a sister named Holly. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, there you go.  Good taste. [LAUGH]
R:  I couldn't hear what the girl said -- something about the something in the Middle East?  The mess, did she say?
L:  No.  It's the current issues in the Middle East and do we feel if peace will ever be obtained and do we feel the United States should be involved?
R:  Oh, okay.  I couldn't hear the first part of what she said. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It was, kind of, garbled.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I had to really listen to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well, my opinion of -- at least the -- the US being involved, is going to be skewed right from the very beginning because my husband is there.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I'm not gonna be for involvement by the US troops by any means.
R:  Where is he?
L:  He is in Iraq.  I honestly couldn't tell you where in Iraq.  I haven't talked to him for over a month.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I don't like the troops being there. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just -- I don't -- I mean, I'm glad that Saddam Hussein was out but, you know, I just -- I, sort of, feel like the problems that they have over there are so huge that, you know, the US just can't solve everybody's problems.  You know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  They're being --
L:  We're trying to be the policemen of the world again.
R:  Yep.
L:  And we're -- that's not our job. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.  And I just think that it -- you know, that the UN should be helping and -- and it just really irks me that, um -- that they're putting our soldiers' lives in danger and also that it makes me really mad that, um -- that they're giving [LAUGH] so many billions and billions of dollars, you know, for all this foreign stuff when people are struggling to just pay their bills here in the US.
L:  Right.
R:  And I mean, I just -- I don't know anybody that is -- is -- doesn't agree with that.  I mean, everybody's just furious about the economy.  It's -- middle America is just suffering.
L:  Mhm.  And sometimes, you know, a l- -- a lot of times when they had this war over in there doing this military action, they kept saying, over and over again, "This is not for the money, this is not for the oil, this is --"
R:  Yep.
L:  "-- not to make us look good".  But I honestly don't believe that.
R:  Well, I've been told by people, ah, they've been sending me, y- you know, email addresses and evidently, ah, there's a common knowledge among -- not common knowledge but knowledge among some of the educated people in Washington and our senators that there's a -- there's, supposedly, like, a -- a doctrine that's been written by -- by Wolfowitz, Cheney, Libby, um, Ashcroft, um, all those guys and it's a ten year plan to, kinda, have world dominance by the US.
L:  Really?
R:  And they tried -- they presented it to Clinton.  I was told that he just turned it down and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- didn't give it any more thought and, um, the -- Bush is the first person that they could get to follow it --
L:  Well --
R:  -- as president --
L:  -- that doesn't surprise me.
R:  And everything's --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- happening according to it.
L:  Huh.
R:  Everything's happening according to this ten year plan and a lot of this homeland security is, you know, to help ourselves but a lot of it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- um, under the guise of getting more information on everybody in the US and we're losing less and less privacy and more and more, um, is being controlled by the government.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I -- I have never heard that before but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's scary how that seems a bit, like, the, um, apocalypse, type of, ah --
R:  I know.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I -- I, ah -- my friend wrote me a letter -- 'cause she lives up in Virginia -- and she's gone to a lot of, like, meetings and stuff with --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, senators.  I think, mor- -- a guy named Moran, one of the representatives was there and he -- and somebody asked a question from the audience if he knew about this and he said, "Yes" and, um -- and it's just, like, the -- everything happening about going into Iran and then I -- I mean, Iraq and then Iran and then Syria, supposedly, y- you know, and all this stuff in the Middle East --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- I don't know.  I just -- I think that [SIGH] -- I think it's so ingrained that -- I mean, there's even psychologists over there that are dedicating their lives to trying to help the youth of, ah, that area, like, in, um, the Gaza Strip and stuff.  Try to realize that, um -- that this is not a way of life --
L:  Right.
R:  -- because it's all they've known since they were little.  They don't know anything else and they're, w- -- you know -- we're trying to -- trying to change something that these people have no concept of peace. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  And so that leads us right back to what you were saying, that we're trying to change something that's much bigger than anything we could ever control.
R:  Yeah.  So, I really am just wondering if -- I -- I really do think that -- that th- they need to take care of the people here in the US and it just outrages me that they're giving billions of dollars to these airlines who then turn around and charge us, you know, all this extra money for airport fees and security and stuff like that.  Fi- -- and, um, it's just -- our national debt is -- is in the trillions now.  I mean, in the last years it just -- e- everything's out of control.  I mean, if you and I did our check books [LAUGH] the way the government is doing their check books [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.  I know.
R:  I mean, we would be --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- told to go to some, kinda, counseling, you know? [LAUGH] Credit counseling or something.
L:  And we'd be homeless and on the streets, that's for sure.
R:  Oh, my gosh.  I just, um -- I don't know.  It's just really frustrating.  And now, there's Africa, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and the thing and [LAUGH] -- I -- a- a- and, you know, what really concerns me about the -- the stuff that's being told to us because I feel like if once we have, um -- we have a question about, you know, the things that our president is telling us in this -- his address to the -- his union [LAUGH] and then, you know, s- saying that, ah, the British told us that -- that the Iraq -aq people were trying to buy, um -- or the Iraq power was trying to buy nuclear weapons from --
L:  Oh, right.  And then --
R:  -- from Africa.
L:  -- it comes out to be completely false.
R:  Turns out it was --
L:  And --
R:  -- completely false.  Well --
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.  And I -- there was even one guy in the news said that the guys were sitting around and they said, "Well, what shall do we 'cause we don't have all this information confirmed?"  And one of 'em said, "Well, let's just say the British told us".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And that's exactly what happened --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- in his seat[?].  The br- -- he -- they said the British told them.
L:  Yeah.  And that's the last people in the world we need to make our enemy. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I mean, how do we know that an- -- that these things are being told, that it isn't just a setup to do what they're planning to do anyway?
L:  Right.  And that's --
R:  Which is, "Let's --"
L:  That's very true.
R:  -- let's figure a way that we can tell it to the public.  Let's say the British told us or let's say this or let's say that because the American public, you know, isn't gonna bother to educate themselves, isn't gonna bother to check these things out".  And --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I think General Wesley Clark is really smart.  I mean, he's been on TV lately and he's a very calm thinker and he's been saying that, you know, "We never told the -- we never told the White House that -- that this was, you know, fact". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  You know, they -- they knew that -- that they didn't have, you know, verified reports.
L:  Right.
R:  That's why I think there's a hidden agenda going on and --
L:  Oh, I would definitely agree with you there.  I mean, I definitely think there's a hidden agenda and -- and I don't think that President Bush is actually the one behind it because he's just --
R:  He's their patsy.
L:  Yeah.  He just doesn't really --
R:  He's the only one they -- stupid enough --
L:  -- have the [LAUGH] --
R:  -- that they could get to follow them.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Sorry for my --
L:  You know?
R:  -- feelings but that's [LAUGH] what he is. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I have to agree, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Anyone who comes out on national television and says, "We're gonna get the bad people."  I -- you know, I -- I don't have any faith in him at all.  So --
R:  Mm.
L:  I -- I would have to agree that he is just their figurehead.  But --
R:  And I've been -- I've been trying to watch as much as I can and learn as much as I can so I've been reading things in Newsweek and, you know -- and all the newspapers and watching TV and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's been a real history lesson but that whole area over there in -- in, you know, i- Israel and Jordan and -- and, um, Palestine, I just -- I -- I just think it's a holy war right from the beginning and that --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, it's -- it's just so inbred that I don't really know that there's anything we can do.
L:  Yeah.  But I do have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to caution you to -- to be careful of what you see on TV because --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it -- I don't think people realize how much of what you see on TV is absolutely baloney. [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I met a guy -- I saw a guy at the park -- I take my dog to the park every day --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and there was a guy there that was -- he just was walking and, um, he stopped to pet my dog and, you know, we were just talking and he just got back from Afghanistan --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and he said he was over there trying to find the big guy, he said.  And I said, "Well, why can't you guys find him?" [LAUGH] You know?  And he said, "Well, I don't even care if we do find him, you know, he's not gonna bother anybody" you know?  He --
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he just said it's just, you know, a mess over there and --
L:  Well, it's --
R:  A- -- he -- they -- troops -- the troops felt good.  A- -- he said the general morale is good, that the troops feel good that they're doing something, you know, to make people's lives better.  But my concern is that once we leave, i- it'll go back right to just where it was. [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  Because --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I mean, like, in Afghanistan, we haven't caught os- -- you know, Osama Bin Laden and we don't know --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- where Saddam is.  So, what's gonna stop 'em from just popping right back up once we leave?
R:  I know.  And they never found Hitler either.  I just --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- don't understand why with -- ah, we can send men to the moon, we have the greatest, you know, ah -- you know, um -- you know --
L:  Technology?
R:  -- what do you call it?
L:  Right.
R:  Technology and --
L:  And yet --
R:  -- and private eyes and --
L:  -- we can't find a dictator. [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, why don't they send in the French Foreign Legion?  Those guys, maybe, could do it.  The French Foreign Legion, they don't have families.  They're all, basically, mostly single people with criminal backgrounds and they -- that's what they live for is to fight and do these missions.
L:  Oh, sure.  But we hate France right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  But the French Foreign Legion -- I don't know if they're loyal to France or whether they just have their hideout there.
L:  I think they're just, kind of, a mercenary.
R:  Yeah.  So, let's --
L:  I really think --
R:  -- send those guys in.
L:  Yeah.  No kidding. [LAUGH]
R:  Supposedly, they were called in for the, um, Desert Storm.
L:  Really?
R:  They were called -- yeah.  I w- -- I talked to a guy on the train, um, one time and -- and he was saying that he'd just -- he's a -- he was going over there to visit them because he had some, kinda, press pass or something --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that he could get in and he said that they were called in -- in -- for Desert Storm but then, for political reasons, they -- it was stopped and so they never went for political reasons.
L:  Huh.
R:  But that's just stupid.  You know, this is the thing is where politics is getting so amassed in this [LAUGH] stuff.
L:  Right.
R:  You know, if they're gonna do a job, then they need to let the military do it and [LAUGH] --
L:  Well, that's true and they need to -- you know, like right now, there's other -- other countries that are saying, "Okay, we're gonna -- we'll give you troops and help you" and I think the le- -- the last thing that President Bush said was, "We're gonna do this by ourselves because we can".  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I'm like, "Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That's great".  So, [LAUGH] we --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- don't want the world to help us 'cause we wanna do it all by ourselves.
R:  Ah, I know it.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, where are you calling from?
L:  I am in Kansas.
R:  Kansas?  Okay.  I'm in Florida.
