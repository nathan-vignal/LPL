R:  Hello?
L:  Hi, my name is Carmen, how 'bout you?
R:  I'm Judy, and I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina.
L:  Oh, okay, I'm in Potts[?] Town[?], Pennsylvania.
R:  Oh, you're up in Pennsylvania.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You're not the lucky lottery --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- winner, are you?
L:  No, I wish I was --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- oh, my gosh.
R:  Well, you know our topic is strikes for professional athletes, I didn't know there were any on strike right now.
L:  You know, I -- I had no idea either.
R:  [MN] But, ah, basically we're supposed to talk about their high salaries that they're paid, and [SIGH] sometimes I feel like, yeah, you know, they're worth it, and other times, I think, oh, there's no way that we should be paying them this much money, but I'd like to think that they give a lot of it away for good causes [LAUGH].
L:  I think they're -- I think they're really overpaid.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Extremely overpaid.
R:  And how did that all start?  I mean, you know, years ago, they weren't --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I mean, ah, these professional b- basketball players now, I -- I [NOISE] -- years ago they didn't make any kind of money like this, 'cause we have a friend that used to play --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I mean, talking thirty years ago, he maybe made, like fifty thousand to a hundred thousand --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- I mean, you didn't talk about millions and millions of dollars, so, I just don't know how it got so out of hand.
L:  Yeah, did you hear about the one boy -- just graduated from high school and got, um --
R:  Oh, the [several inaudible words].
L:  -- a hundred million or something?
R:  Yeah, my, um -- we're from Ohio, and my -- my one son goes to Penn State, and he went to see him play, and, I mean, and they put him on pay per view, they were charging to watch this kid play -- he's eighteen years old.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  His mother went out and bought him a fifty thousand dollar Hummer for his eighteenth birthday --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- but yet, they live in the -- they're poverty, you know, ah, stricken --
L:  Right.
R:  -- so, it's like, everybody was wondering how she could afford to give him this Hummer, well, we all know that he was gonna get the endorsement from the big shoe company and sign --
L:  Right.
R:  -- for at least one million, so ...
L:  And, then we hear about this store that ga- -- got, um, gave him a shirt and they were making a big deal over it.
R:  Yes, yes, they said he -- [MN] it's something about he traded some autographs and pictures with the store owner --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the store owner gave him all these jerseys or something, for him and his friends, and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was a big deal, yeah, I know.
L:  I don't see the big deal about it.
R:  So, what that does, is tell our kids, that, "Oh yeah, it's -- you know, you don't have to go to college, you just do real well in high school and you can go straight into the pros".
L:  Yeah, that's -- that's true, 'cause --
R:  But, I don't know if that happens in other sports, I know, it's happened a lot in basketball, because we have the Kobe Bryant, and we have --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know --
L:  He's from where -- my area.
R:  Yeah -- I do?
L:  No, Koby Bryant's from my area.
R:  Oh, he is?
L:  Yeah, straight from high school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Straight from high school, but do they do it in football?
L:  Yeah, that's so true.
R:  I don't think there's any football players that don't go to college, and go straight to the [inaudible].
L:  No, they all have to go to college -- hockey players and everybody.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, basketball players --
R:  Baseball.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I guess if you're good enough with basketball, then, ah, you can go straight to the pros.
L:  Right, and next thing you know, they're going to, um, grab you straight out of high [NOISE] -- before you even finish high school.
R:  And that's what I'm afraid of, 'cause you know, they were looking at that with [several inaudible words] -- in his junior year --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- saying that, you know, he didn't even have to graduate --
L:  [NOISE] Right. [NOISE]
R:  But, I don't know if his mother put her foot down, or the Commissioner --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- or somebody, but ...
L:  Yeah, it has to be done -- children need their education.
R:  Yeah, and they do -- they all make too -- way too much money --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I mean, I can't even relate to the money they make, but --
L:  No.
R:  -- it's never ending, I mean -- they do have salary caps for different, you know, football teams --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and stuff, where you can --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- only pay so much for everybody on the team, but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- unless they --
L:  But, the endorsements and everything is like --
R:  I know.
L:  -- amazing [NOISE].
R:  Even if this -- the Brown[?] James[?] kid would break his leg --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and never play basketball --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- he is still a --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- multimillionaire at this point.
L:  And don't have to worry about money ever again in his life [NOISE].
R:  Mm mm --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no.
L:  And it -- [NOISE] I seen like, when MTVs -- they showed their houses [NOISE] --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- they live so well. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, they have in ground pools, out ground pools --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- special made cars --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- their own private jets --
R:  Well, that's 'cause they have so much money they don't know what to spend it on.
L:  Right, exactly.
R:  So, you know, but --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but that's not gonna stop, I mean --
L:  No.
R:  [SIGH] 
L:  It's entertainment -- it -- the entertainment industry [MN] makes a lot of money.
R:  Yep, and I don't -- I don't ever see it stopping, I see it just getting worse and worse and worse.
L:  Right.
R:  Unless somebody steps in, like, the commissioners for all the sports, and says, "Okay, enough is enough, this is the most any athlete can be paid", and that's not gonna happen.
L:  No.
R:  I mean, I wish it could.
L:  Right.  I mean, but, if you think about it --
R:  [LAUGH] I have a feeling if they did, these guys wouldn't play.
L:  Right, if you think about -- right --
R:  If they said, "Okay, everybody -- everybody's gonna make one million dollars, and that's it -- no more, no endorsements, nothing else".
L:  Right, but then --
R:  [inaudible]
L:  -- nobody else would make money.
R:  Right, but, do you think they'd play if they only made a million?  Or, would -- some -- I mean, they'd almost have to, because what else are they gonna do?
L:  Exactly, mhm.
R:  Since they don't have, you know, [MN] I mean, they're not doctors, they're not lawyers, they're not -- you know, they'd have to play --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- and maybe that's the answer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- just come on in, and say, "Okay everybody, I don't care who you are, how well you play, or what your name is --"
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  "-- you're making a million bucks".
L:  But --
R:  "And that's it."
L:  -- you know, but, if I was an athlete, I -- I would take the money, [inaudible] it's like, "Oh no, I only wanna make a million" -- if they're gonna give me, like, sixty million, just because I could play good, I mean --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I'll take it.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  You know, so ...
R:  It's -- I just don't ever see it ending.
L:  No.
R:  It just gets worse and worse, and more and more, and I -- [SIGH] I don't think there's anything anybody can do about it.
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  I mean, [MN] you know, when our kids grow up and let -- let's say one of them went into pro sport, [MN] it's not just gonna be one million, then there's gonna be ten million and twenty million sign on bonuses --
L:  [MN] Right, right.
R:  -- on top of the salaries, so, it's like, I mean, I know that you have to increase it each year with inflation, but, our salaries don't increase that much [LAUGH].
L:  No, they don't, they don't --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it'd be nice to make money like that.
R:  Yeah, it would be [inaudible] --
L:  I know, my kids, they're talking about, "Oh, I'm gonna be a athlete", my daughter's like, "Oh, I'm gonna be a professional tennis player" --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and ...
R:  Did you say, "Well, that's good honey, but go to school first, and then ...". [LAUGH]
L:  Right, yeah, I -- I told her that and she looks at me like I'm crazy.
R:  I'm one -- do you have any idea what, like, Serena and Venus Williams make as tennis players?  I don't really know what they make.
L:  I have no idea, but they make good money [NOISE].
R:  They should --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I mean, they're good, but I don't know if it's --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- outrageously astronomical --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and I know they have some, um, commercials they do, and some sponsors that --
L:  Right, and the endorsements, right?
R:  Yeah, that pay them a pretty penny.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, I just wondered what they made -- I have no clue.
L:  No, but people like Tiger Woods -- he makes really good money.
R:  Oh, my lord.  I can only imagine what Chrysler's paying him now to do those commercials [inaudible] --
L:  Oh, my gosh, I know.
R:  I just -- ah -- I -- I don't think it would matter if he never golfed again.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know what, he's one of the few -- I mean, he really does enjoy the game and he would -- I think he would do it for free --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- if he --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if he came down to them, saying, "Look, we're not gonna --"
L:  [NOISE]
R:  "-- ever pay you again", he would still play in golf tournaments.
L:  Yeah, well, one thing about him -- he's so humble about it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he doesn't flash it, and --
R:  No.
L:  -- you know ...
R:  No, and he has a foundation that he gives a lot of money to.
L:  Right, I would do the same thing.
R:  Course there's still a lot left over.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right, I would do the same thing if I was rich, give, you know, something away.
R:  [MN] Well, yeah, I --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, I have no -- I mean, you can't spend it all.
L:  Right.
R:  You can't.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I -- I don't care how many houses you got --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can't spend -- that's just like -- we were talking about the people that won this lottery, you know --
L:  Right.
R:  -- it was up to what?  Two hundred and sixty mills[?] -- you can't spend all that in your lifetime.
L:  No.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Why be stingy with it?  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Really.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You gotta spread some of it around, [SIGH] but I don't know -- I just don't think it's ever gonna end with the athletes.
L:  Right, I don't know ...
R:  And I don't -- I don't know how much, like, soccer players make, or, um --
L:  [LIPSMACK] 
R:  -- I think the big ones are like, basketball, football, baseball, um --
L:  I still -- I still think the top is basketball --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it really is.
R:  I think so.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I know golfers make good, but I don't think it's so outrageous, like the basketball players.
L:  No, unless you're like a Tiger Woods.
R:  Um ...
L:  And, I think the reason why he gets a lot of his endorsements --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he's good, but also --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- he's like, the first youngest black kid, or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, Asian and black, to -- to do what he did, and nobody can beat him.
R:  That's right, but I -- I --
L:  So, he really stood out for that.
R:  -- I'd be curious to find out though, what a, like -- professional soccer players, you know, what they make, and, well, I tell you what --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- these -- have you ever seen the arena football?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, yeah, well, we have it here in Charlotte, and we actually went to one one time, and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- these guys only make, like, ten thousand dollars a game --
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  -- yeah, but they play, and they give it their all, they're -- they're, you know, wannabe professional football players that didn't make it in the pros, but they're still very good --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's very entertaining, it's just that it's indoors, and it's called arena football.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  But, they give it everything they've got, and they make ten thousand a game.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.
R:  But, can you imagine, what would happen if we did that with other football players?  We said, "Okay, it doesn't matter how good you are, or what happens, you're gonna get ten thousand dollars a game".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right, oh, I can live off a that.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  You just give me three games a year, I'd be happy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm serious, and they -- but I -- [LIPSMACK] I forget how many they do play a year, especially arena football -- I think it's two a week, instead of -- the pros only play one a week and they play --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what?  Maybe, twenty six weeks or something.
L:  Right.
R:  But, that's still enough for 'em -- twenty six times ten thousand, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  They get two hundred and sixty thousand to live off a -- that's enough.
L:  Right, that's true --
R:  That'll put food on their ...
L:  -- and I would think ...
