R:  Hi, my name is Ancor[?] and I'm living in New Jersey.
L:  Hi, I'm Karen, I'm in New York.
R:  Er, hi, how are you?
L:  Okay.
R:  So, what do you think about airport security now?
L:  Um, I don't -- I think it's slightly, um, I forgot the que- -- um, I don't think it's slowly -- it's secure. I think with terrorism and everything, they have other ways to go around airport security.  I think if even if they heighten it up that, you know, there's always ways of getting around it.
R:  But, you know, right now the Federal Government has taken over the security for airports and, ah, previously almost all the workers were hourly wages and probably could easier because they are not probably too, you know, taking care too much of the job.  I mean they probably didn't take their jobs too seriously and probably they even sub- -- September eleventh unfortunately I've raised this spectre of international terrorism once again, and, I mean, even now when, you know, most of these television stations or newspapers, they send undercover reporters, they find that things have not really changed that much, only the queues have got longer and I'm sure if you've gone over the July fourth weekend, you've taken a plane, I mean, you probably have to check in three hours earlier, so even though airport security has been heightened, there are ways as you correctly said of getting around security.
L:  Yeah, there's always -- I mean -- I -- I think they've heightened it to a certain ways but I still think it's not a hundred per cent secure.  There's no like hundred per cent guarantee of anything any more.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, ah, when you -- when you take flight now and they -- they frisk you, they have those, you know, metal detectors and, I mean, even then, suppose you're wearing a belt, they assume that that belt is the cause of the beep and not anything under the belt.  I mean, there are -- if somebody wants to blow up a plane again, I hope not, but I'm sure that if somebody is determined enough they can still do it.  It's not -- it's not foolproof.  I mean --
L:  Right.
R:  People actually get around, there are so many ways.  I mean, even though -- even though probably the person who is working at the security counter, I mean, what guarantee that he's not going to be the one who kind of lets the terrorists in?
L:  That's right.
R:  So --
L:  And, I mean, even someone working on a plane, you know, that's going around some of the security.
R:  Mm.
L:  I mean --
R:  Because --
L:  -- they say it's so secure for the passengers but I don't know how secure it is for all the employees.
R:  Yeah, I mean, ah, you know, you remember when during the Cold War, the Russians used to train spies like, you know, really big spies who probably draw upon in the US and thought of in this country and nobody would ever imagine that they were working for the KGB or what not, and, you know, if they decide that they want to train as terrorists in the US, nobody will ever come [inaudible] guy is actually a terrorist.  I mean, he might take up training -- he's a pilot, he kills his copilot and he's armed whatever he wants to do, I mean, there's no guarantee of anything.
L:  That's -- yeah, that's a big thing.  I mean, I personally haven't flown even be- -- I don't like to fly even before September eleventh.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But there was never that strict and I know my -- my husband took an air apparently in flight like the -- the month after.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And the airport had, you know, a simple security even for my, you know, my daughter, who was only four -- three at the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it wasn't, you know, they say it was so heightened but, this was like a month later, and it wasn't that, you know, they -- his belt beeped and they let him walk right through.
R:  Yeah.
L:  The car seat beeped, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Little things and that was like not even -- that was a month later.
R:  Yeah, I mean, I -- I mean, I can't be too degrading about them also because probably there is no foolproof method.
L:  No.
R:  And the heightened security has only served to probably make the queues longer but, I mean, the government has to do something about it.  I mean, they have probably taken steps in the right direction.
L:  Right.
R:  But, ah, over a period of time, they will refine the metal and come up with something that is absolutely foolproof but, I mean, they are still open to terrorism in -- through aeroplanes but, I mean, the government is trying to do it -- do it and -- over a period of time with more experience.  They probably come to no harm, they can make the system better.
L:  Yeah, it's going to take time.  I mean, they're making little changes and I'm sure that helps, and like you said, over a period of time it does increase because they learn more advances and I think a lot of things are computerized.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think that's how they can get, you know, you can get through a lot of things.
R:  Yes.  I mean, it -- probably the government has to think very carefully about how it lets, I -- I mean, there is very --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- lots of innocent tourists who are denied access to this country now but I think the government has to be very careful in whom it grants visas and whom it allows entry into the country.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, it can't -- it can't be like blanket that nobody is allowed or it can't be like it's a free for all but they have to be selective in whom they are allowing and whom they are not allowing and that will probably go a long way in, um, eliminating the type, absolutely not just a terrorism threat but, you know, like a threat from all -- all fronts, probably a threat from the sea or a threat from the air.
L:  That's right.  I mean, it's -- it's increased and, you know, hopefully that will solve some of it but it's going to be, you know, keep going toward the future.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, luckily nothing has happened that they had to worry.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But there's always other ways.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, probably the government can learn a lot probably from Israel because I think Israel is one country which has lived with this terrorism threat for probably the last thirty five, forty years, and they never ever seem to have these kind of disasters, so probably the government can send some agents over to Israel and get them trained there.  Maybe that might help because I think they have far better intelligence than the CIA or the -- the FBI can ever do.  I mean, MOSSAD is way ahead of these people.
L:  Right.
R:  So I think the elimination of the root is far more important than, you know, like they said prevention is better than cure, so they're trying to, you know, cure the system which [several inaudible words] terrorism as its root, otherwise allowing these terrorists into the country.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, they -- I've -- they stop a lot of people that look -- just because of their looks too.
R:  Yes, yes.
L:  I mean, and you can't just go by looks 'cause, you know, they say like a lot of foreigners --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- you know, a lot of the foreigners just 'cause they look foreign and act, you know, 'cause sometimes it's miscommunication if they act different 'cause of miscommunication, they pull 'em over.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, they'll stop 'em, and it can't be like that 'cause some of those, you know, it could be just a regular American person in the inside.
R:  Right.
L:  Who's, you know, just knowledgeable and -- in terrorism too.  I mean, right now, since September eleventh, with the heightened security, they're just anyone that looks weird or suspicious or foreigners.  I mean, a lot of the foreigners are being taken advantage of in this situation.  They're being, you know, they're pulling more of them out just because they're foreigners.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which is wrong also.
R:  Yeah, that's -- that's probably wrong because those people are discriminated against just because they look from a certain region of the world and I -- I don't think that's right.  You can't, I mean, it's -- it's a very fine sword, you know, because they can't be too careful also and they can't be lax also.  They have to find that balance and at this time I think it's better to err on the side of safety just because it makes the skies safer, but it is discriminating.
L:  Yeah, I think, um, that's al- -- you know, I mean, it's -- it's good to be protected but it's wrong to discriminate everybody.
R:  Yeah.  I know a friend of mine went through this horrid experience because -- just because he had a Middle Eastern name.  He was -- I mean, his parents were from the Middle East but he's been in the US for like -- he been brou- -- he's been born and brought up in this country, and he had to go through like a frisk and they asked him to strip and, I mean, that's degrading, that's humiliating.
L:  That's right, just 'cause he was, you know, a name.
R:  Yes.
L:  I mean, it's -- that's true too.  I mean, you can have a name that looks suspicious and they think, you know, that's -- they're heightening security and they don't know what really they're looking for, that's the problem.
R:  Yes.  They're -- they're trying to search for a needle in a haystack.  I mean, if a terrorist wants to bomb, it's very difficult unless you have very specific information or intelligence, you are not really going to get to the terrorist himself.
L:  Right.
R:  And these people are [inaudible] fighters.  I mean, they -- they're not concerned about their own lives so nothing is going to deter them from, er, stopping.
L:  Right.  And, I mean, besides heightening airport security, you know, other areas like, you know, the bridges and tunnels, you know, those can all -- they need to worry about everything as a whole not just airports.
R:  Exactly.  I mean, they have to take a holistic approach.  It's not just tightening airport security, they just took measures aimed specifically at the core of September eleventh, that is airplanes, but, I mean, there's so many other avenues for these people to come in and strike.
