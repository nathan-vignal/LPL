I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'LL FIND ANY OTHER KIND OF WAYS TO GET AROUND [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW AIRPORT SECURITY  (fe_03_08574-B-0005)
RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT IN DIFFERENT CITIES THERE'S LIKE A LIKE IN NEW YORK AND MIAMI AND THOSE TYPES OF CITIES THERE'S LIKE A BIGGER  (fe_03_08574-B-0006)
OR A A MORE OF A A SECURITY  (fe_03_08574-B-0007)

THEY REALLY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING I GUESS THEY  (fe_03_08574-B-0011)

I'M NOT SURE IF THEY WOULD LET YOU KNOW LIKE PEOPLE FL- THROUGH OR NOT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08574-B-0020)
WITHOUT NECESSARILY DOING ALL THE CHECKS THAT THEY COULD  (fe_03_08574-B-0021)

THE TERRORIST LEVEL IS YOU KNOW LIKE THE COLORS THAT THEY PUT ON THE TERRORIST ALERT OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_08574-B-0028)
RIGHT I GUESS THEY WHAT THEY DO IS WHAT THE AIRPORT IS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH OF A RISK THEY THINK  (fe_03_08574-B-0031)
THAT AIRPORT WOULD BE AT BECAUSE LIKE OUR AIRPORT HERE IS AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT SO THEY HAVE QUITE A BIT OF SECURITY JUST BECAUSE UM PEOPLE FROM INTERNATIONAL CITIES ARE COMING IN  (fe_03_08574-B-0032)
AND FLYING IN AND OUT OF YOU KNOW INTERNATIONAL PORTS  (fe_03_08574-B-0033)
SO I GUESS THEY HAVE MORE  (fe_03_08574-B-0034)
I DON'T KNOW A SECURITY LEVEL [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08574-B-0035)

EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A PLASTIC  (fe_03_08574-B-0043)
SO ANYTHING SHARP B- EVEN EVEN LIKE AH PLASTIC FORKS AND KNIVES ARE NOT ALLOWED  (fe_03_08574-B-0044)
THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW HER TO WHAT  (fe_03_08574-B-0045)
OH THAT'S WEIRD  (fe_03_08574-B-0046)
I KNOW [LAUGHTER] I WONDER WHAT THEY DO LIKE WHEN THEY UM BECAUSE SOME OF THE SOME BAGS ARE RANDOMLY SCANNED WHAT THEY WOULD DO LIKE IF IF  (fe_03_08574-B-0047)
A RANDOMLY SCANNED BAG HAD SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN IT  (fe_03_08574-B-0048)
NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE GONNA BRING  (fe_03_08574-B-0049)
ON THE PLANE YOURSELF  (fe_03_08574-B-0050)

SEARCH BUT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO OUT THEY DON'T DO THE SAME KIND OF SEARCH AS THEY DO WHEN YOU GO IN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08574-B-0068)
THEY JUST THEY DO SCAN EVERYTHING THEY PUT IT UNDER LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT TO WHERE IT'LL SCAN EVERYTHING SO THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING IN THERE  (fe_03_08574-B-0069)
IN YOUR BAG  (fe_03_08574-B-0070)

I GUESS THEY'RE JUST MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEMSELVES I DON'T KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08574-B-0075)
THEY'RE LIKE WELL THEY'RE LEAVING AND THEY'RE LEAVING WITH SOME BAD STUFF THEN  (fe_03_08574-B-0076)
THEY'D FIGURE THAT WE WOULD CHECK IT BECAUSE YOU DO LIKE I USUALLY LAND IN MIAMI IN IN THEIR AIRPORT THEY RUN YOU KNOW THROUGH ALL THOSE SCANS AND STUFF TOO  (fe_03_08574-B-0077)
