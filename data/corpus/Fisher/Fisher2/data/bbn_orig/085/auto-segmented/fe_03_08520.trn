GOOD WHERE WHERE ARE YOU  (fe_03_08520-A-0005)
LANCING MICHIGAN I'M IN BROOKLYN NEW YORK  (fe_03_08520-A-0006)
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND TIME TODAY THAT THEY'VE CALLED ME AND THIS HAS BEEN THE TOPIC  (fe_03_08520-A-0007)
YEAH  (fe_03_08520-A-0008)
IT IS BUT I'M IT'S THE SECOND CALL BUT I JUST SIGNED UP LIKE THIS MORNING  (fe_03_08520-A-0009)
OH THAT IS EASIER YEAH THIS ONE'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE THERE'S NOT ALL THAT MUCH TO SAY BUT WE NEED I THINK DO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME  (fe_03_08520-A-0010)
EIGHT OF THE TEN OKAY  (fe_03_08520-A-0011)
WELL AND ALSO IT'S IT'S LIKE IF THE THE DEMAND IS THERE  (fe_03_08520-A-0012)
AND SO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SO THAT THEY SO THEN THEY IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEIR EMPLOYEES ESSENTIALLY SO  (fe_03_08520-A-0013)
YOU MEAN YOU'D WANT PEOPLE'S EMPLOYEES TO GET PAID TO BE PAID AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW THEY CAN  (fe_03_08520-A-0014)
TO  (fe_03_08520-A-0015)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08520-A-0016)
BUT THEN THERE'S THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN WHICH IS  (fe_03_08520-A-0017)
TWO TWO THINGS THAT I THOUGHT OF BEFORE [COUGH]  (fe_03_08520-A-0018)
IN MY PREVIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS WHICH WAS ONE ONE IS THAT UM LIKE THE TICKET PRICES TO GO SEE THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS ARE SO HIGH  (fe_03_08520-A-0019)
THAT YOU'D THINK LIKE A LOT OF LIKE NORMAL SORT OF LIKE MIDDLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY CAN'T REALLY AFFORD  (fe_03_08520-A-0020)
TO GO TO THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS LIKE TO SEE LIKE THE METS PLAY OR TO SEE THE CELTICS PLAY OR TO SEE  (fe_03_08520-A-0021)
SO LIKE YOU KNOW DOES THAT IT'S SORT OF LIKE UM BECOMES  (fe_03_08520-A-0023)
AH ECONOMICALLY INACCESSIBLE TO LIKE A CERTAIN CLASS OF OF INCOME  (fe_03_08520-A-0024)
SO AND IF THEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW 'CAUSE NOBODY I MEAN IN FACT NOBODY REALLY NEEDS TO MAKE LIKE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR LIKE SOME OF THEM DO AND IF THEY LOWERED THEIR SALARIES YOU'D THINK  (fe_03_08520-A-0025)
THAT THEY'D BE SAVING MONEY SO THEY COULD ACTUALLY LOWER THE TICKET PRICE AND MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE FOR  (fe_03_08520-A-0026)
PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY GO SEE THE GAMES AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08520-A-0027)
THAT CAN DO IT YEAH  (fe_03_08520-A-0028)
THE TIGERS RIGHT  (fe_03_08520-A-0029)
OH RIGHT OKAY  (fe_03_08520-A-0030)
MINOR MINOR LEAGUES  (fe_03_08520-A-0031)
I GUESS SO BUT WHEN YOU LIKE IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS OR E._S._P._N. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THE MINOR LEAGUES AND LIKE  (fe_03_08520-A-0032)
THE THE MAIN PLAYERS AND THE BASEBALL CARDS AND THE YOU KNOW BASKETBALL CARDS AND ALL THAT STUFF YOU ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT  (fe_03_08520-A-0033)
THE MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS SO THAT'S SORT OF LIKE I FEEL LIKE LIKE IF KIDS HAVE IDOLS AND THEY WANT TO BE ATHLETES OR THEY YOU KNOW AND THEY LOVE THE GAME AND STUFF LIKE IT'S REALLY LIKE THE THE PROFESSIONAL  (fe_03_08520-A-0034)
YOU KNOW LIKE THE MAJOR LEAGUES IN BASEBALL N._B._A. AND BASKETBALL YOU KNOW TH- THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE OR WHATEVER  (fe_03_08520-A-0035)
LIKE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SEE AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S  (fe_03_08520-A-0036)
IT YOU KNOW IT'S SORT OF IT'S LIKE ALMOST LIKE A SUBSTITUTE YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO SEE A GAME OF BASEBALL AND MAYBE LOVE THE GAME BUT IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE PLAYERS  (fe_03_08520-A-0037)
AS MUCH AS YOU DO IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES BUT AT THE SAME TIME  (fe_03_08520-A-0038)
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THOSE PLAYERS ARE YOU KNOW MAKING SO MUCH MONEY AND THEY BECOME LIKE CELEBRITIES IN A WAY  (fe_03_08520-A-0039)
THAT'S TRUE  (fe_03_08520-A-0040)
BUT THEN MY OTHER THOUGHT ON IT WAS THAT AND IT DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO BASEBALL BUT OR YOU KNOW MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS BUT IT DOES I MEAN BUT IT DEFINITELY IS APPLICABLE IS THAT  (fe_03_08520-A-0041)
LIKE I I DON'T KNOW I'M A PRETTY LIBERAL PERSON  (fe_03_08520-A-0042)
AND I THINK THAT LIKE  (fe_03_08520-A-0043)
YOU KNOW COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS AND AND SPORTS TEAMS THAT MAKE AND THEY MAKE LIKE EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE INVOLVED  (fe_03_08520-A-0044)
YOU KNOW THE ATHLETES AND THE OWNERS AND THE INVESTORS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BUT I THINK THAT THEY ALSO SORT OF HAVE A A RESPONSIBILITY TO IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY TO LIKE DISTRIBUTE  (fe_03_08520-A-0045)
THEIR WEALTH MORE EVENLY AND NOT LIKE  (fe_03_08520-A-0046)
BECAUSE THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR CONSTITUENCY OR WHATEVER ARE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE YOU KNOW NOT MAKING MULTI MILLION DOLLAR  (fe_03_08520-A-0047)
SALARIES A YEAR  (fe_03_08520-A-0048)
THAT LIKE THEY TH- THOSE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS SORT OF HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO LIKE MORE PHILANTHROPIC THINGS WITH THEIR MONEY SO LET'S SAY LIKE EVERYBODY GOT YOU KNOW EVERYONE WHO MAKES LIKE FIVE MILLION OR MORE GOT A YOU KNOW MADE A MILLION DOLLARS LESS  (fe_03_08520-A-0049)
YOU FREE UP TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR THAT YOU CAN DO LIKE CHARITABLE WORK OR YOU CAN HAVE THE PLAYERS OR THE THE OWNERS DO THINGS FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY EXIST IN  (fe_03_08520-A-0050)
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT  (fe_03_08520-A-0051)
BIG BUSINESS YEAH  (fe_03_08520-A-0052)
YEAH AND I MEAN IT'S IT'S ONE THOSE THINGS WHERE I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING IN OUR SOCIETY IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS IS RELATED IN ONE SENSE OR ANOTHER AND SO YOU YOU DON'T THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE UM  (fe_03_08520-A-0053)
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU KNOW THIS YEAR HOW MANY  (fe_03_08520-A-0054)
TENS OF OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GOT LAID OFF BECAUSE OF THE BAD ECONOMY  (fe_03_08520-A-0055)
AND AND BUT YOU HAVE TO ALSO REALIZE THAT LIKE THAT MAYBE THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH LIKE THE GLUTTONY OF LIKE THE TOP TWO OR THREE PERCENT OF OF LIKE INCOME  (fe_03_08520-A-0056)
IN THIS COUNTRY AND AND YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE PAY CUT SO THEY LAY OFF TEN OR FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES  (fe_03_08520-A-0057)
OR A HUNDRED OR TEN THOUSAND OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW IF IT'S  (fe_03_08520-A-0058)
G._M. THEY LAY OFF YOU KNOW AN ENTIRE PLANT OF PEOPLE AND AND SEND LABOR TO LIKE SOME COUNTRY WHERE YOU CAN PAY SOMEONE TEN CENTS AN HOUR TO DO IT AND YOU LOSE ALL THESE JOBS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM DIRECTLY RELATED BUT I FEEL LIKE THE GENERAL PHILOSOPHY BEHIND  (fe_03_08520-A-0059)
PAYING SOMEONE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S TO PLAY BASEBALL OR OR BUILD COMPUTERS OR BUILD CARS  (fe_03_08520-A-0060)
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME  (fe_03_08520-A-0061)
NO I MEAN I I'VE I'VE DABBLED WITH THE FOUNTAINHEAD AND I'VE READ PARTS OF ATLAS SHRUGGED BUT I KNOW HER HER OBJECTIVISM AND HER THAT THAT WHOLE THEORY OF HERS  (fe_03_08520-A-0062)
I MEAN  (fe_03_08520-A-0063)
I GUESS THAT'S ACTUALLY THE IT IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A IT SEEMS LIKE A CONTRADICTION IN IN IN PHILOSOPHIES BECAUSE I'M ALL FOR THE ABILITY FOR SOMEONE TO STRIKE IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A NEED TO  (fe_03_08520-A-0064)
TO LIKE LOBBY FOR FOR MORE RESOURCES OR MORE MONEY OR MORE  (fe_03_08520-A-0065)
BUT I FEEL LIKE IF YOU ARE MAKING IF IF LIKE YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE LEAGUES HAVE A MINIMUM SALARY SO IF YOU PLAY PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL YOU CAN'T MAKE LESS THAN AND I THINK FOR MOST OF THEM IT'S IN THE LIKE  (fe_03_08520-A-0066)
TWO TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR  (fe_03_08520-A-0067)
AND TO ME  (fe_03_08520-A-0068)
THAT IS ENOUGH MONEY TO ESTABLISH SECURITY SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE RETIRE WELL AND LEAVE YOUR FAMILY A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY IF YOU MAKE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A TEN YEAR CAREER THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY  (fe_03_08520-A-0069)
