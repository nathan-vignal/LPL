BUT IT IT'S DIFFICULT TO ARGUE ABOUT WHAT A REASONABLE PRICE IS FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING  (fe_03_08500-B-0026)
WITHOUT KNOWING AH ALL THE GRABBING HANDS IN THE MIDDLE  (fe_03_08500-B-0027)

BROUGHT ALL THESE TOURIST DOLLARS IN  (fe_03_08500-B-0031)
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE TRAVELING ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO GO TO A GAME IT HELPS YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY PAID FOR THOSE TICKETS  (fe_03_08500-B-0032)
IT'S ENOUGH THAT MOST PEOPLE JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO GO  (fe_03_08500-B-0033)

HAVING A UNION LIKE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A GREAT THING  (fe_03_08500-B-0050)
AND AND WE'RE YOU KNOW MAYBE JEALOUS OF NOT ACTUALLY HAVING THAT KIND OF LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE'RE MORE INTERCHANGEABLE  (fe_03_08500-B-0051)
RIGHT AS SEEN  (fe_03_08500-B-0053)
YEAH AND THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS DOWN SIDES BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE THOSE ATHLETES AND WE SEE THEIR SALARIES WE THINK IT PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE DOWNSIDES ARE  (fe_03_08500-B-0054)

YOU KNOW WITH OUR BOSSES OR YOU KNOW WE COULDN'T WE COULDN'T HAVE ONE ON ONE SORT OF AH TRIPS THROUGH THE CAREER PATH  (fe_03_08500-B-0056)
THINGS BECOME VERY FORMALIZED WITH A UNION AND SUBJECT TO MORE CORRUPTION BECAUSE THERE'S MORE LAYERS AND SO ON  (fe_03_08500-B-0057)
SO UM I I'M NOT REALLY SURE ALSO WHEN WE LIKE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PLAYERS STRIKING BUT LIKE YOU SAID IF THE WHOLE TEAM ISN'T A MEMBER THEN  (fe_03_08500-B-0058)
THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS SITUATION OF WHO DECIDES WHO'S PART OF THE UNION FOR THE PLAYERS  (fe_03_08500-B-0059)
LIKE ON A ON A FACTORY FLOOR IF SOMEBODY  (fe_03_08500-B-0061)
