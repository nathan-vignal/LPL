HI I'M ALEX  (fe_03_08528-B-0001)
OH THE TOPIC  (fe_03_08528-B-0002)
YES AH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES AND STRIKES HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE RECENT STRIKES THEY'VE HAD AND DO YOU FEEL THAT THEY DESERVE THE CONTRACTS OR THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE GETTING  (fe_03_08528-B-0003)
I THINK EVERYONE FEELS THAT WAY  (fe_03_08528-B-0004)
BUT IN IN ONE WAY THOUGH I MEAN THE ARGUMENT THAT I HEAR IN FAVOR OF THEM MAKING ALL THAT MONEY IS  (fe_03_08528-B-0005)
THEY WOULDN'T BE TAKING IT SOMEBODY WASN'T OFFERING IT  (fe_03_08528-B-0006)
SO  (fe_03_08528-B-0007)
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT PLAYER A FEW YEARS AGO THAT AH  (fe_03_08528-B-0008)
THE BASEBALL PLAYER WHO GOT LIKE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR  (fe_03_08528-B-0009)
WHICH I THINK'S VERY RIDICULOUS BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED TO SAY  (fe_03_08528-B-0010)
HE DIDN'T ASK FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION SOMEBODY OUTBID THE OTHER PEOPLE BY A LOT AND IS HE REALLY SUPPOSED TO SAY NO  (fe_03_08528-B-0011)
NO THANKS  (fe_03_08528-B-0012)
YEAH UNDERSTAND  (fe_03_08528-B-0013)
YEAH SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TO EXPECT UM BECAUSE I HEAR YOU KNOW I FOLLOW SPORTS AND I HEAR ON LIKE THE RADIO THE SPORTS SHOWS  (fe_03_08528-B-0014)
AND THEY KIND OF WANT IT BOTH WAYS THEY TALK AND THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PLAYERS GETTING A LOT OF MONEY BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU HEAR SOMEBODY TURNING DOWN MORE MONEY SO THEY COULD STAY  (fe_03_08528-B-0015)
AT A CITY THEY'RE HAPPY WITH BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES ARE THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE THEIR FAMILY AROUND  (fe_03_08528-B-0016)
AND YOU HEAR THEM CRITICIZING THE PLAYERS SAYING YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08528-B-0017)
THIS GUY DOESN'T CARE ABOUT WINNING OR WHATEVER HE'S JUST YOU KNOW HE HAS NO INTEREST HE JUST WANTS A PAY CHECK AND I THINK OH  (fe_03_08528-B-0018)
WE KIND OF WANT IT BOTH WAYS WE CRITICIZE THEM AND WE SAY THEY'RE DUMB WHEN THEY DON'T TAKE THE MONEY BUT THEN WE CRITICIZE THEM WHEN THEY DO TAKE THE MONEY  (fe_03_08528-B-0019)
BUT AH I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW SPORTS IS SUPPOSED TO BE KIND OF LIKE FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT AND IT DOES LEAVE A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU SEE THEM STRIKING IT'S KIND OF HARD TO BE SYMPATHETIC WHEN THEY MAKE  (fe_03_08528-B-0020)
I THINK IN BASEBALL THEY MAKE ABOUT THE AVERAGE PLAYER JUST MAKES ABOUT TWO OR THREE MILLION A YEAR SO WHEN YOU HEAR THEM GOING ON STRIKE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY WHAT ARE THEY FIGHTING FOR MORE YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF STRIKES AND LABORS  (fe_03_08528-B-0021)
LABOR UNIONS I THINK OF TRYING TO MAKE CONDITIONS AT WORK BEARABLE AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEY MAKING YOU KNOW TWO THREE MILLION A YEAR  (fe_03_08528-B-0022)
I COULD LIVE ON THAT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08528-B-0023)
YEAH THAT'S HOW MOST OF US FEEL SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO  (fe_03_08528-B-0025)
TO BE SYMPATHETIC I STOPPED FOLLOWING BASKETBALL FOR EXAMPLE JUST BECAUSE OF THE LAST STRIKE THERE WAS A PLAYER SAYING YEAH WE MAKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT WE ALSO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY  (fe_03_08528-B-0026)
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE OF THE DUMBEST THINGS I HEARD IT'S LIKE YOU WANT SYMPATHY BECAUSE YOU SPEND MONEY  (fe_03_08528-B-0027)
OH THAT'S WHAT GETS ME AND FOOTBALL I THINK YOU PAY AROUND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS DEPENDING WHAT CITY YOU LIVE IN ABOUT THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PARKING  (fe_03_08528-B-0028)
THAT THAT'S A CRIME  (fe_03_08528-B-0029)
YEAH BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS I WOULD NEVER PAY THAT AMOUNT  (fe_03_08528-B-0032)
BUT YOU SEE THESE GAMES SOLD OUT AND YOU KNOW WELL SOMEBODY IS PAYING IT  (fe_03_08528-B-0033)
SO  (fe_03_08528-B-0034)
PART OF ME SAYS IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TO BLAME 'EM OKAY MAYBE  (fe_03_08528-B-0035)
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T ASK FOR THAT MUCH BUT IF PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO PAY THE MONEY THEN I DON'T SEE WHY THEY'RE GOING TO STOP  (fe_03_08528-B-0036)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08528-B-0037)
YEAH I THINK THAT'S ADMIRABLE  (fe_03_08528-B-0038)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08528-B-0039)
SOME OF THESE  (fe_03_08528-B-0040)
SINCE ABOUT THE SOMEWHERE IN THE SEVENTIES WHEN THEY WERE  (fe_03_08528-B-0042)
BEFORE IT USED TO BE THE OWNERS CONTROLLED IT THEY OWNED YOU KIND OF LIKE AH THE MOVIES THE SAME THING YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH THEM THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH YOU AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE THEN IN THE SEVENTIES THEY WENT TO COURT  (fe_03_08528-B-0043)
AND THEY  (fe_03_08528-B-0044)
SAID OKAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU CAN JUST SIGN THEM FOR SORT OF CONTRACTS AND THEN THEY CAN GO WHEREVER THEY WANT  (fe_03_08528-B-0045)
BUT I MEAN I REMEMBER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO HEARING A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THINKING WOW THAT GUY'S GETTING A MILLION A YEAR  (fe_03_08528-B-0046)
NOW THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GUYS TEN TWELVE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR  (fe_03_08528-B-0047)
YEAH I I MEAN IT KIND OF MAKES ME UPSET AT MY PARENTS FOR NOT FORCING ME TO PLAY BASEBALL OR SOMETHING [LAUGHTER] THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME  (fe_03_08528-B-0048)
SOME OF THESE GUYS AREN'T EVEN GOOD  (fe_03_08528-B-0049)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08528-B-0050)
OH THE PRESIDENT MAKES I DON'T KNOW TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR  (fe_03_08528-B-0051)
YEAH I I I THINK I COULD SETTLE ON THAT [LAUGHTER] I WOULDN'T GO ON STRIKE  (fe_03_08528-B-0052)
CALIFORNIA  (fe_03_08528-B-0053)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08528-B-0054)
WELL I LIKE IT BUT I THINK KIND OF WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MONEY AND WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE PLAYERS GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S WHERE IT KIND OF SPOILS IT BECAUSE YOU LIKE YOU LIKE FOR IT TO BE INNOCENT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08528-B-0055)
FOR A LOT GUYS IT'S THAT THING WHERE YOU REMEMBER YOUR DAD TAKING YOU FOR THE FIRST GAME AND YOU LIKE  (fe_03_08528-B-0056)
TO DO THAT WITH YOUR SON BUT  (fe_03_08528-B-0057)
YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU CAN RELATE TO THE PLAYERS ANY MORE THEY'RE ALL OUT OF TOUCH AND AH YOU DON'T REALLY WANT THEM CHEERING SOME OF THESE PLAYERS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOOD SOME OF THEM ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE SOME ARE  (fe_03_08528-B-0058)
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE BEING OUTNUMBERED BY  (fe_03_08528-B-0059)
THE BAD ONES  (fe_03_08528-B-0060)
WELL YOU SEE SOME OF THEM ARE THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY YOU DON'T HEAR THAT IN THE NEWS WHICH KIND OF GETS ME UPSET AH BECAUSE  (fe_03_08528-B-0061)
THERE SHOULD BE SOME BALANCE IF THEY'RE GOING TO REPORT THE BAD STUFF WHEN THEY GET IN TROUBLE WHICH THEY SHOULD THEN THEY SHOULD AL- ALSO REPORT THE GOOD STUFF THOUGH SO  (fe_03_08528-B-0062)
YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO WHO ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE THERE AND YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08528-B-0063)
STUFF LIKE THAT BUT AH UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T GET MUCH PUBLICITY  (fe_03_08528-B-0065)
I DON'T KNOW IF WRESTLING GETS IT MAINLY THE BIG ONES BASEBALL FOOTBALL BASKETBALL HOCKEY  (fe_03_08528-B-0066)
THEN YOU HAVE OTHER SPORTS LIKE UM BOXING JUST THE BEST GET THE BIG MONEY AND THAT'S JUST A REAL SMALL HANDFUL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE ARE  (fe_03_08528-B-0067)
YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET A FEW HUNDRED OR A FEW THOUSAND BUT OF THAT FEW THOUSAND YOU GOTTA PAY THEY GOTTA PAY EVERYONE  (fe_03_08528-B-0068)
THEY GOTTA PAY THEIR TRAINERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO FIX THEM UP WHEN THEY GET CUT UP THEY GOTTA PAY THEIR MANAGERS SO YOU GET THE MONEY BUT THEN YOU GOTTA PAY EVERYONE  (fe_03_08528-B-0069)
