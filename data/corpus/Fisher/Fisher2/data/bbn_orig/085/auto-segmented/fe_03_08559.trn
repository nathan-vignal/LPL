I THINK IT IS LARGELY JUST MAKES PEOPLE FEEL BETTER I QUESTION HOW EFFECTIVE IT ACTUALLY IS I QUESTION WHAT'S REALLY BEING DONE BECAUSE NO ONE SEEMS TO REALLY WANT TO LET US KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A SEC- SECURITY ISSUE TO GIVE OUT TOO MUCH INFORMATION  (fe_03_08559-A-0009)
BUT UM AS A FA- I THINK I THINK IT'S MORE SHOW THAN ACTUAL EFFICACY THAT'S THE WAY IT APPEARS TO ME  (fe_03_08559-A-0010)
OH ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S JUST IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS 'CAUSE I MEAN I USED TO I UNTIL RECENTLY LIVED IN LOS ANGELES AND L._A._X. WAS ONE OF THE MAIN  (fe_03_08559-A-0011)

PERHAPS OUR POLICIES AND WHAT NOT AND NOT JUST AT AIRPORT SECURITY AND UM  (fe_03_08559-A-0020)
MHM  (fe_03_08559-A-0021)
I I DON'T NOTICE THAT IN MYSELF MAYBE AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE OF LIVING IN LOS ANGELES AND WORKING IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY WHERE YOU DEAL WITH A LOT OF MIDDLE EASTERNERS  (fe_03_08559-A-0022)
AND I HAD NOT A LOT BUT SEVERAL MIDDLE EASTERN FRIENDS SO I THINK THAT KINDA PUTS A DIFFERENT FACE ON IT WHEREAS THERE'S SUCH A TENDENCY WITH MIDDLE EASTERN CULTURE  (fe_03_08559-A-0023)
FOR THEM EVEN WHEN THEY IMMIGRATE OVER TO THE STATES TO STAY AMONGST THEIR OWN COMMUNITY  (fe_03_08559-A-0024)
WHITE PEOPLE OR PEOPLE OF OTHER RACES NOT JUST WHITE PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE OF OTHER RACES FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE UM  (fe_03_08559-A-0026)
APPROACHING THEM AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A THREAT YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW WE PERCEIVE IT THAT'S WHAT WE SEE ON TELEVISION JOURNALISTS ET CETERA ET CETERA  (fe_03_08559-A-0027)
OH NO I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M JUST SAYING THAT SINCE NINE ELEVEN TH- THAT'S THE FACE THAT'S BEEN PUT ON THE RACE FOR US BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A TRAUMATIC EVENT  (fe_03_08559-A-0028)

MOST OF US ARE RATIONAL ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OF MIDDLE EASTERN DESCENT TH- YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE YOU KNOW BUT THERE'S CRACKPOTS AMONG EVERY GROUP YOU KNOW AND I JUST I THINK THAT AS I SAY  (fe_03_08559-A-0030)
UM  (fe_03_08559-A-0031)
WE HAVE TO LOOK MORE AT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AS DIFFERENT RACES AS DIFFERENT CULTURES THAN AS SIMPLY YOU KNOW TRYING TO  (fe_03_08559-A-0032)
KEEP SOMEBODY FROM A KNIFE IN THEIR SHOE [LAUGHTER] GETTING ON A PLANE YOU WANNA DO THAT TOO UNDOUBTEDLY YOU KNOW YOU DO WANNA HAVE  (fe_03_08559-A-0033)

ALL I HEARD ON MY ANSWERING MACHINE WAS CARRIE'S NAME PLANE AND THE WORLD TRADE CENTER  (fe_03_08559-A-0035)
AND I TURNED ON THE TELEVISION AND I THOUGHT I HAD JUST SEEN MY FRIEND GET BURNED ALIVE  (fe_03_08559-A-0036)

UM YOU KNOW AND SHE WAS SAYING THAT SHE WAS NOT SHOCKED AT ALL  (fe_03_08559-A-0047)
THAT THEY HAD CHOSEN TO FLY OUT OF BOSTON BECAUSE SHE HAD NO DOUBTS IN HER MIND THAT OF THE MAJOR CITY AIRPORTS THAT WERE YOU KNOW WITHIN A REASONABLE STRIKING DISTANCE OF NEW YORK  (fe_03_08559-A-0048)
THAT BOSTON WAS PR- PROBABLY BY FAR THE WORST BECAUSE SECURITY WAS JUST COMPLETELY LACKADAISICAL THERE WERE A LOT OF COMMUTER UM REGULAR COMMUTER AH  (fe_03_08559-A-0049)
FLYERS AND THEY JUST WAVE 'EM THROUGH WOULDN'T CHECK THEM YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08559-A-0050)
NOTHING SO I THINK A LOT OF IT IS JUST A MATTER OF GETTING THOSE PEOPLE YOU KNOW TO WHERE THEY'RE NOT EARNING SEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND PEOPLE ARE MAKING FUN OF THEM  (fe_03_08559-A-0051)
AND YOU KNOW CALLING THEM LAZY AND STUPID AND MAKING JOKES PRACTICALLY TO THEIR FACES YOU KNOW SO THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE I MEAN [LAUGHTER] THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE POSTAL WORKERS [LAUGHTER] FOR THE LEVEL OF DISGRUNTLEMENT  (fe_03_08559-A-0052)

I THINK  (fe_03_08559-A-0054)
AS I SAY I THINK THAT IS A MAJOR KEY IS PEOPLE REALIZING THAT THIS ISN'T JUST SOME RENT A COP WITH NO POWER THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO'S ACTUALLY THERE TO KEEP YOU SAFE  (fe_03_08559-A-0055)
THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB AND THEY'RE BEING PAID WELL FOR THEIR EXPERTISE AND IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET PAID FOR THEIR EXPERTISE THEY BETTER BY GOD HAVE THEIR EXPERTISE [LAUGHTER] IS  (fe_03_08559-A-0056)

ABSOLUTELY AND AND I'M SURE THAT THERE'S THERE'S PROBABLY BEEN A A BIG INCREASE IN THAT IN PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CARING  (fe_03_08559-A-0063)
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THESE PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFICULT JOB AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF THE LAST GATEWAY FOR STATE OF AH PROTECTION  (fe_03_08559-A-0064)
YEAH  (fe_03_08559-A-0065)
MHM I THINK THAT WOULD HELP AND AS I SAY UM  (fe_03_08559-A-0066)
M- MAKING THEM DEFINITELY RAISE THEIR PAY JUST BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT ALREADY BECAUSE IT IT IS A THANKLESS JOB BUT UM RAISE IT COMMENSURATE WITH EXPERIENCE RAISE IT COMMENSURATE WITH FURTHER TRAINING  (fe_03_08559-A-0067)
YOU KNOW IF YOU VOLUNTARILY GO IN FOR FURTHER TRAINING AS FAR AS YOU KNOW BECOMING MORE OF AN EXPERT ON SECURITY ISSUES AND WHAT NOT THEN YOU THEREFORE GET A RAISE OR YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE WITH THE COMPANY  (fe_03_08559-A-0068)
YOU KNOW I THINK THERE SHOULD BE FEDERAL SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE THAT REQUIRE A CERTAIN MINIMUM LEVEL OF TRAINING YOU MUST HAVE THIS KNOWLEDGE  (fe_03_08559-A-0069)
OR HAVE THIS LICENSE WHICH YOU KNOW REQUIRES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS JOB I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS TOWARDS MAKING IT MORE EFFECTIVE YOU KNOW BECAUSE UM  (fe_03_08559-A-0070)
I THINK A LOT OF IT IS JUST  (fe_03_08559-A-0071)
W- JUST SLOW MOVING BUREAUCRACY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT  (fe_03_08559-A-0072)
NOT AT ALL BUT UM I DO REALIZE THAT I WOULD BE IN THE DISTINCT MINORITY WITH THAT UM I WAS RAISED IN A FAMILY THAT IS EXTREMELY  (fe_03_08559-A-0073)

HOWEVER I THINK THAT IF I WERE ON A PLANE  (fe_03_08559-B-0003)
CONSIDERING WHAT HAPPENED ON NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_08559-B-0004)
AND A TERRORIST WAS TO STAND UP I THINK I COULD TAKE HIM ALONE [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08559-B-0005)

WITHIN ME OF OF OF THEIR BEING A POSSIBLE TERRORIST DOES COME UP MHM  (fe_03_08559-B-0017)
WELL I NEVER DID HAVE THAT BEFORE THOUGH  (fe_03_08559-B-0018)
YES  (fe_03_08559-B-0020)
WELL DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW WE COULD  (fe_03_08559-B-0021)
HOW WE COULD BETTER FIX THE AH SECURITY ISSUE AH AND FL- PLANES  (fe_03_08559-B-0022)
THAN WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW  (fe_03_08559-B-0023)
OH MY  (fe_03_08559-B-0025)

DO YOU THINK RAISING THE SALARIES OF THOSE WORKERS AND MAYBE AH EVEN SCRUTINIZING  (fe_03_08559-B-0035)
THE AH POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE ABLE TO AH AH CUT DOWN AH AT LE- AT LEAST MAKE THE PUBLIC EVEN FEEL UM MORE SECURE TOO  (fe_03_08559-B-0036)
WELL HAV- HAVING A UNIFORMED UM WHAT TROOPS IN THE AIRPORT DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY KIND OF SATISFACTION  (fe_03_08559-B-0037)
