USED TO BE A BIG BASEBALL FAN A LONG TIME AGO I THINK IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE I WAS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST FAN I COULD BE ABOUT BASEBALL AND THEN THE STRIKE CAME IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND AFTER THAT I REALLY STOPPED WATCHING BASEBALL 'CAUSE SOMEHOW I GOT REALLY PISSED OFF AND SORT OF UPSET ABOUT THE  (fe_03_08514-A-0005)

BASEBALL WAS A LOT MENTALLY  (fe_03_08514-A-0009)
AND IT WAS KIND OF UPSETTING TO SEE MY FAVORITE BASEBALL PLAYERS GIVING UP THEIR SEASON  (fe_03_08514-A-0010)
