UH THE PERSONNEL THAT'S PUTTING THE THINGS ON THE PLANE THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN  (fe_03_08550-B-0034)
BUT IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY TODAY  (fe_03_08550-B-0035)
THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE JUST TO WALK THROUGH THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE OFF THEIR SHOES SO THEY CAN SEE EVERYTHING  (fe_03_08550-B-0036)

THE PASSENGERS YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS PERSONNEL THAT PUT THINGS ON THE PLANES YOU KNOW YOU YOU MAY HAVE A A CRAZY STEWARDESS HOW CAN YOU STOP THAT YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08550-B-0052)
SO IT IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST MORE THAN ONE PRONG APPROACH [NOISE] UH JUST SAYING THAT THE TERRORISTS WOULD COME THROUGH  (fe_03_08550-B-0053)

THE TERRORISTS CAN SHIFT TO THE PILOT  (fe_03_08550-B-0057)
CAN SHIFT TO THE THE OTHER PERSONNEL THAT PUTS THINGS ON THE PLANE  (fe_03_08550-B-0058)
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE SECURE THERE'S OTHER PORTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO BE EQUALLY AS CONCERNED ABOUT  (fe_03_08550-B-0059)
YES BUT THEY THEY HAVE NOW THE PEOPLE THAT RIDE THE AIRPLANE  (fe_03_08550-B-0061)
ALSO IF THEY PUT THE MONEY INTO SECURING THE DOORS THEN THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE YOU KNOW HAVING TO HAVE SOMEONE YOU KNOW STAND THERE BY THE DOOR  (fe_03_08550-B-0062)
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE THEY HAVE HIRED THE SKY SKY MARSHALS  (fe_03_08550-B-0063)
IF THEY PUT THE MONEY INTO SECURING THE DOORS THEN THAT WOULD BE SECURE  (fe_03_08550-B-0064)

ALL THIS CRAZY STUFF BECAUSE THERE'S EVIL IN THE WORLD THAT UM  (fe_03_08550-B-0068)
THEY HAVE OTHER WAYS I THINK I DON'T THINK [LAUGHTER] THEY REALLY FOCUS IN ON TAKING DOWN PLANES THAT WAY ANYMORE  (fe_03_08550-B-0069)
BUT THE TERRORISTS HAVE WON IN TERMS OF SETTING UP THE FEAR FACTOR NOW IN TERMS OF THE SECURITY IF THEY'RE GOING TO SECURE IT SECURE IT ACROSS THE BOARD DON'T GIVE ME A SENSE OF UH UM FALSE SECURITY  (fe_03_08550-B-0070)
WHERE YOU YOU FRISK ME AND DID ALL OF THESE THINGS BUT THEN YOU HAVE PERSONNEL  (fe_03_08550-B-0071)
THAT CAN DO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO  (fe_03_08550-B-0072)
SO TO ME THAT'S A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT DO IT ACROSS THE BOARD DON'T JUST FRISK ME DO ALL OF THESE THINGS  (fe_03_08550-B-0073)
THEN YOU HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT PEOPLE CAN GO BEHIND THE SCENES DO WHAT THEY YOU KNOW DO CRAZY STUFF AND THE WHOLE TEN YARDS [NOISE]  (fe_03_08550-B-0074)
