LIKE FOR US TO LEAVE HERE AND GO TO A SPORTING EVENT IN PITTSBURGH OR BUFFALO OR TWO TWO AND A HALF THREE HOURS AWAY FROM THOSE PLACES  (fe_03_08524-B-0064)
IF WE GO SAY MY HUSBAND AND I AND OF COURSE OUR CHILDREN ARE GROWN I'M IN MY SIXTIES BUT IF WE HAD FIVE CHILDREN AND WE WENT ONE TIME  (fe_03_08524-B-0065)

EVEN HALF EVEN IF HALF THE PEOPLE JUST WOULDN'T GO  (fe_03_08524-B-0075)

AH TO A DECENT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD FEEL LIKE DON'T YOU THINK UM  (fe_03_08524-B-0088)
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SHOULD BE GOOD FOR THESE PEOPLE WITH THEIR INSURANCE CAPS AND THEIR TRAVELING CAPS  (fe_03_08524-B-0089)
THEIR TRANSPORTATION  (fe_03_08524-B-0090)
