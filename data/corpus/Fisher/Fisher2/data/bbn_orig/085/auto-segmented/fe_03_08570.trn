SO  (fe_03_08570-A-0011)

NOT ONLY THAT THE SCREENERS AREN'T PROPERLY TRAINED  (fe_03_08570-A-0013)
THERE'S A LOT OF NONSENSE THAT THE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO GET ONTO THE PLANE  (fe_03_08570-A-0014)
YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS A FEW CASES HERE IN MICHIGAN WHERE  (fe_03_08570-A-0015)
UM SOME WOMEN THAT WERE PRACTICALLY UM UNABLE TO WALK AND PARALYZED AND THEY'D HAD MANY AH SURGERIES DONE TO THEIR BACKS AND THEIR BONES AND YOU KNOW THEY HAD METAL PLATES IN THEM  (fe_03_08570-A-0016)
AND THEY LITERALLY CONDUCTED STRIP SEARCHES ON THESE WOMEN  (fe_03_08570-A-0017)
AND YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08570-A-0018)
SO SO THERE IS A BIG ISSUE HERE  (fe_03_08570-A-0019)
WITH A LOT OF THAT THAT WENT DOWN THAT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHEN THAT HAPPENED  (fe_03_08570-A-0020)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-A-0021)
OH WOW  (fe_03_08570-A-0022)
MHM  (fe_03_08570-A-0023)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-A-0024)
RIGHT IT PROBABLY DETERS THE SMALLER CRIMINALS FROM TRYING TO PULL THINGS OFF BECAUSE NINE CHANCES OUT OF TEN THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN THROUGH JU- JUST AS A REGULAR PASSENGER WOULD  (fe_03_08570-A-0025)
BUT YOU GET PEOPLE THAT ARE HIGHLY TRAINED AND THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINING AND PROBABLY CALCULATING THIS PLAN FOR PROBABLY FIVE TEN YEARS  (fe_03_08570-A-0026)
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE EVERY ROUTE COVERED AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO DO  (fe_03_08570-A-0027)
YOU KNOW JUST LIKE YOU SAID THEY HAVE A BACK DOOR [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08570-A-0028)
UM NO I HAVEN'T FLOWN IN YEARS  (fe_03_08570-A-0029)
RIGHT [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08570-A-0030)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-A-0031)
NO WAY  (fe_03_08570-A-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-A-0033)
EXACTLY THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETERRED BUT  (fe_03_08570-A-0034)
YEAH  (fe_03_08570-A-0035)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-A-0036)
YEAH DEFINITELY THEY START RIPPING OFF PEOPLE'S SHOES THEY'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO LOSE MORE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN FROM PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE TO FLY  (fe_03_08570-A-0037)
EXACTLY  (fe_03_08570-A-0038)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-A-0039)
YEAH  (fe_03_08570-A-0040)
IT CAN GO BOTH WAYS IT CAN GO BOTH WAYS IT PROBABLY LIKE I SAID IT PROBABLY DETERS THE LITTLE ONES  (fe_03_08570-A-0041)
FROM YOU KNOW DOING ANYTHING ON A FLIGHT BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHTENED SECURITY BUT  (fe_03_08570-A-0042)
BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE ORGANIZATION FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME FOR MAYBE FIVE TEN YEARS OR EVEN MORE  (fe_03_08570-A-0043)
THAT NOBODY EVEN KNOWS ABOUT YOU KNOW THERE IS A PILOT OR HAS BEEN TRAINING  (fe_03_08570-A-0044)
AND HAS BEEN DOING THESE THINGS AND YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO REALLY KNOW  (fe_03_08570-A-0045)
YOU KNOW SO [LAUGHTER] IT CAN GO BOTH WAYS  (fe_03_08570-A-0046)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-A-0047)
EXACTLY YEAH THAT'S ONE THING THAT I'VE DEFINITELY HAD I'VE ALWAYS HAD AN ISSUE WITH THAT UM YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE CARRYING IN THEIR LUGGAGE  (fe_03_08570-A-0048)
YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE IF THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THAT KIND OF STUFF THEN THEY BE NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON CHECKING THE LUGGAGE MORE THAN THE PEOPLE  (fe_03_08570-A-0049)
THAT'S THAT'S MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE YOU KNOW 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERSON NEXT TO ME HAS IN THEIR BAG  (fe_03_08570-A-0050)
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ALWAYS MADE ME NERVOUS WHEN I USED TO FLY YOU KNOW WHAT DO THEY HAVE OR WHAT'S IN THEIR BAG UNDERNEATH IN THE CARGO HOLD YOU KNOW I MEAN WHOA [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS MADE ME THINK  (fe_03_08570-A-0051)
EXACTLY YOU KNOW SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO CARE WHERE IT'S AT  (fe_03_08570-A-0052)
MHM  (fe_03_08570-A-0053)
DO THEY CHECK PILOT LUGGAGE  (fe_03_08570-A-0054)
DO THEY EVEN CHECK PILOT LUGGAGE  (fe_03_08570-A-0055)
OR DOES THAT GO THROUGH NO SECURITY AT ALL  (fe_03_08570-A-0056)
YEAH I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT THAT  (fe_03_08570-A-0057)
YES I HAVE I LIKED IT IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE  (fe_03_08570-A-0058)
RIGHT RIGHT WELL IT WAS BASED ON A TRUE STORY I BELIEVE WAS IT NOT YEAH YEAH SO IT MAKES YOU WONDER YOU KNOW  (fe_03_08570-A-0059)
THIS GUY DID ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS WHICH YOU KNOW IT WORKED GRANTED AGAINST THE LAW BUT HE DID IT YOU KNOW [LAUGHTER] HE POSED AS A DOCTOR HE POSED AS AN AIRLINE PILOT I MEAN [LAUGHTER]  (fe_03_08570-A-0060)
RIGHT BUT THAT'S WHAT MADE IT SO AMAZING THAT IT WAS TRUE IT'S LIKE WHOA  (fe_03_08570-A-0061)
HELLO  (fe_03_08570-B-0001)
MY NAME IS GARY  (fe_03_08570-B-0002)
AND I LIVE NEAR DAYTON OHIO  (fe_03_08570-B-0003)
AND YOUR NAME IS WHICH  (fe_03_08570-B-0004)
LORETTA  (fe_03_08570-B-0005)
I USED TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND BY THE NAME OF LORETTA  (fe_03_08570-B-0006)
LONG AGO  (fe_03_08570-B-0007)
LONG TIME AGO AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT  (fe_03_08570-B-0008)
OH OKAY LORRIE  (fe_03_08570-B-0009)
WELL I GUESS OUR TOPIC IS  (fe_03_08570-B-0010)
HEIGHTENED AIRPORT SECURITY AND WHETHER WE THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP THINGS  (fe_03_08570-B-0011)
AND [SIGH] QUITE FRANKLY I'M A LITTLE BIT HESITANT TO SAY THAT I THINK IT WILL HELP BECAUSE THERE ARE  (fe_03_08570-B-0012)
TOO MANY OTHER WAYS YOU CAN DO DAMAGE  (fe_03_08570-B-0013)
AND I THINK AH IN GENERAL WE'RE MAKING  (fe_03_08570-B-0014)
A LOT OF FOLKS  (fe_03_08570-B-0015)
GO THROUGH AN AWFUL LOT AND I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF SECURITY IMPROVEMENT OVER THE WHOLE DEAL  (fe_03_08570-B-0016)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_08570-B-0019)
OH ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I'M A PILOT  (fe_03_08570-B-0020)
NOT A COMMERCIAL PILOT A PRIVATE PILOT BUT IF I WERE WERE LOOKING TO TRY TO GET THROUGH SECURITY I WOULD FIND SOMEBODY THAT COULD GO IN THE BACK DOOR  (fe_03_08570-B-0021)
THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON KEEPING PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THE AIRPORT FROM GETTING INTO HIGH SECURITY AREAS  (fe_03_08570-B-0022)
AND FOR THAT MATTER  (fe_03_08570-B-0023)
I MEAN I COULD TAKE MY LITTLE AIR AIRPLANE LAND AT THE AIRPORT AND I COULD TAXI RIGHT UP TO ONE OF THE AIRLINERS IF I WANTED TO BLOW IT UP AND DO SO RIGHT THERE ON THE TAXIWAY  (fe_03_08570-B-0024)
THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP YOU YOU CAN THIS MOHAMMED ATTA WHO WAS THE HEAD PILOT IN THE NINE ELEVEN  (fe_03_08570-B-0025)
DID THAT AT MIAMI HE TOOK A TWIN ENGINE AIRCRAFT I I LIVE IN THE WINTER TIME IN VENICE FLORIDA WHICH IS RIGHT AT THE AIRPORT WHERE AH MOHAMMED ATTA TRAINED IN FACT I'VE FLOWN IN THAT AIRPORT NUMEROUS TIMES  (fe_03_08570-B-0026)
IN THE SAME TERMINAL BUT UM HE FLEW A TWIN ENGINE WITH ONE OF HIS BUDDIES OVER TO MIAMI THEY TAXIED IT RIGHT UP BESIDE A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN  (fe_03_08570-B-0027)
GOT OUT SAID THE AIRPLANE WOULDN'T START AND LEFT IT PARKED RIGHT BESIDE A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN  (fe_03_08570-B-0028)
AND MY GUESS IS THEY WERE PROBABLY DOING IT JUST TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY SECURITY TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING THAT  (fe_03_08570-B-0029)
AND THERE WASN'T  (fe_03_08570-B-0030)
SO I MEAN  (fe_03_08570-B-0031)
[SIGH] I I GUESS IT MAKES YOU SORT OF THINK THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY INVOLVED WHEN IN REALITY IT PROBABLY ISN'T  (fe_03_08570-B-0032)
RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-B-0033)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_08570-B-0034)
OH  (fe_03_08570-B-0035)
DEFINITELY  (fe_03_08570-B-0036)
ABSOLUTELY HAVE YOU FLOWN RECENTLY  (fe_03_08570-B-0037)
I HAVE SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND THE THE  (fe_03_08570-B-0038)
DOOR ON THE COCKPIT THEY NOW HAVE A LITTLE METAL BAR ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE DOOR  (fe_03_08570-B-0039)
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOU OUT  (fe_03_08570-B-0040)
I MEAN LET'S GET REAL PUT A REAL DOOR ON AH THE ISRAELI EL AL AIRLINE  (fe_03_08570-B-0041)
HAS A KEVLAR DOOR  (fe_03_08570-B-0042)
THAT YOU COULDN'T SHOOT A MACHINE GUN THROUGH  (fe_03_08570-B-0043)
WE DON'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT AND AND FURTHERMORE  (fe_03_08570-B-0044)
THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF THESE SHOULDER HELD  (fe_03_08570-B-0045)
MISSILES OUT THERE FLOATING AROUND ON THE BLACK MARKET AND IF I WANT TO SHOOT DOWN AN AIRLINER I'M JUST GOING TO GO OUT THERE ON THE FLIGHT PATH SOMEWHERE AND SHOOT IT DOWN WITH A MISSILE  (fe_03_08570-B-0046)
THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DEFENCE AGAINST IT  (fe_03_08570-B-0047)
THERE IS A METHOD IN FACT IS- ISRAELI AIRLINES HAVE IT AND THAT'S A A A DETECTOR SYSTEM THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DETECT A MISSILE THAT SHOT AT THEIR AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL DO THE NECESSARY COUNTER MEASURES TO STOP IT  (fe_03_08570-B-0048)
BUT IT COSTS ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS AN AIRPLANE TO PUT THIS ON  (fe_03_08570-B-0049)
AND THE F._A._A. SAYS WE JUST CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO DO THAT  (fe_03_08570-B-0050)
AND QUITE FRANKLY HOW MUCH DO THE LAWSUITS COME TO FOR EVERY PLANE THAT CRASHES  (fe_03_08570-B-0051)
A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY  (fe_03_08570-B-0052)
A LOT MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD COST TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF DEVICE PUT ON YET WE'RE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO PAY THESE AS YOU PUT IT EARLIER ON UNDER TRAINED PEOPLE  (fe_03_08570-B-0053)
TO TRY TO SCAN  (fe_03_08570-B-0054)
IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP IN FACT IF I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING HATEFUL I WOULDN'T DO IT WITH AN AIRLINE NOW I'D GET ME A TRUCK AND GO SOMEWHERE WITH A TRUCKLOAD OF EXPLOSIVES  (fe_03_08570-B-0056)
I'D PARK IT ON THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE AND BLOW THE BRIDGE UP  (fe_03_08570-B-0057)
THERE ARE SO MANY HATEFUL THINGS YOU CAN DO AND RIGHT NOW  (fe_03_08570-B-0058)
THEY'RE LOOKING AT AIRPLANES SO DO SOMETHING ELSE  (fe_03_08570-B-0059)
AND IT'S FRUSTRATING I MEAN THEY TOOK MY SHOES OFF  (fe_03_08570-B-0060)
WHEN I WENT THROUGH THE LINE AT THE AIRPORT THE LAST TIME THEY WANTED TO LOOK IN MY SHOES THEY RUBBED A SWAB INSIDE THE SHOES AND THEN THEY RAN THE SWAB THROUGH A SPECTROGRAPH TRYING TO FIND OUT IF I HAD BEEN NEAR EXPLOSIVES  (fe_03_08570-B-0061)
I MEAN GIVE ME A BREAK  (fe_03_08570-B-0062)
OH I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO HAVE JUST SAID FORGET IT I'LL DRIVE  (fe_03_08570-B-0063)
I AS I SAID I LIVE IN FLORIDA SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND HERE IN DAYTON OHIO THE OTHER SIX MONTHS  (fe_03_08570-B-0065)
I FIGURE ON AVERAGE IT TAKES ME TEN HOURS TO FLY  (fe_03_08570-B-0066)
TO MY HOUSE IN FLORIDA  (fe_03_08570-B-0067)
I CAN DRIVE IT IN SIXTEEN HOURS  (fe_03_08570-B-0068)
SO IT GETS TO A POINT OF DO I WANT TO PUT UP WITH ALL THIS CRAP  (fe_03_08570-B-0069)
SO I DON'T KNOW IT'S UM  (fe_03_08570-B-0070)
THAT'S RIGHT  (fe_03_08570-B-0071)
THAT'S RIGHT [SIGH]  (fe_03_08570-B-0072)
PROBABLY BETTER WAYS TO SPEND YES  (fe_03_08570-B-0073)
I WOULD RATHER SEE THEM SPEND THE MONEY ON OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE THAN LIKELY TO WORK AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT SCANNING THE BAGGAGE THAT GOES UNDERNEATH  (fe_03_08570-B-0074)
IT'S STUPID TO WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE IF I WERE GOING TO SEND A BOMB ALONG I'D PUT IT IN MY BAGGAGE THAT GOES UNDERNEATH IT'S NOT EVEN LOOKED AT  (fe_03_08570-B-0075)
AND IT THESE PEOPLE ARE  (fe_03_08570-B-0076)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_08570-B-0077)
AND WHAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO BLOW THEMSELVES UP  (fe_03_08570-B-0078)
WELL HEAVENS NO  (fe_03_08570-B-0079)
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET SOME AH WORKERS  (fe_03_08570-B-0080)
THAT ARE WILLING TO PUT SOMETHING ON BOARD THE PLANE  (fe_03_08570-B-0081)
AND THE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE WORKING AT THE AIRPORT AREN'T AREN'T THE MOST SAVORY TYPES OF PEOPLE  (fe_03_08570-B-0082)
PARDON  (fe_03_08570-B-0083)
I DON'T THINK SO  (fe_03_08570-B-0084)
UM I'M PRETTY SURE THE PILOT UM HAS PRETTY MUCH A FREE RIDE AND AND YOU COULD JUST  (fe_03_08570-B-0085)
I MEAN PUT ON A PILOT'S UNIFORM AND DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING  (fe_03_08570-B-0086)
DID YOU SEE THAT AH MOVIE CALLED CATCH ME IF YOU CAN  (fe_03_08570-B-0087)
BUT THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE IF YOU'VE GOT THE NERVE  (fe_03_08570-B-0088)
ABSOLUTELY TRUE  (fe_03_08570-B-0089)
I SAW AN INTERVIEW WITH THE GUY AND HE SAID ALL TRUE  (fe_03_08570-B-0090)
YEAH  (fe_03_08570-B-0091)
I MEAN IF IT HADN'T BEEN TRUE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS STUPID  (fe_03_08570-B-0092)
ABSOLUTELY  (fe_03_08570-B-0093)
SO [SIGH] I DON'T KNOW UM  (fe_03_08570-B-0094)
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN  (fe_03_08570-B-0095)
UM IT PROBABLY WON'T BE AIRPLANES NEXT TIME THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHER  (fe_03_08570-B-0096)
UM NASTY THINGS YOU CAN DO  (fe_03_08570-B-0097)
JUST BLOWING UP ONE AIRPLANE DOESN'T REALLY  (fe_03_08570-B-0098)
