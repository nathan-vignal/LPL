R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  My name's Marsha.  Who is ...?
L:  My name -- my name is Cerita.[?]
R:  Cerita?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, that's a different name.
L:  [LAUGH] Yep.  So, hobbies is the, uh, topic?
R:  Hobbies is the topic, yes.
L:  Okay, 'cause I didn't catch it.  My boyfriend answered the phone and I -- and he said, "I don't know what they were saying".  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.  You know what?  I -- I found it's easier to call in.
L:  Oh, you can call in some time?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.
R:  That's -- to me that's -- that's been easier.
L:  Oh, okay.  I have never called in.  I've -- well, I've only done two other ones.
R:  I -- that's all I did too, but I --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I decided all this is easier to call in than it is to -- to not be on the Internet or whatever.
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, my hobby is saving money.  [LAUGH]
L:  O- oh, now, you know what?  I didn't realize that was a hobby, but I like that too.  [LAUGH] Yep.  What -- what do you?  Do you, uh, clip coupons or ...?
R:  Well, I tell you, um, I've always been one [NOISE] -- I always like to look for deals and stuff and I like -- I really like to go to garage sales --
L:  Oh, okay.  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, oh, right before Christmas I was looking --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- on the Internet and I found a site and it was, uh, a coupon refund exchange.
L:  Oh.
R:  I guess they have like -- they have, uh, like a magazine you can order and you read it --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and it tells you what all the current, um, rebates are and stuff, and so I signed up for that and I've really been getting big in that.  So, I've been ...
L:  Oh, it's magazine, huh?
R:  Yeah.  And then they -- they tell ya what all the rebates that are available, all the items that are free after rebate, and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they give you hints on how to -- to use your coupons and to get the best deals, like to all these all items for free.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I've been spending a lotta time doing that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and getting everything organized.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I read a lot.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I love to read books.
L:  Yeah, I do too.
R:  Uh, and I have -- the other thing I spend a lotta time doing is [NOISE] my, uh, photo, like of the kids and stuff.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I label them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then on the back and it says who they are and when it was taken and where it was taken and the year --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then I always get doubles and I divide 'em up among the kids and then so the kids have their own photo albums and that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They don't have all the pictures 'cause I have to divide 'em between four kids and then --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- then I have mine, which has all the pictures.
L:  Okay.  So, you keep it organized and everything, huh?
R:  Yeah.  I have -- I actually -- oh, probably about ten years ago I went back from when we first got married --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and so I have, uh [NOISE] -- I have all the years done.  I -- I don't have -- well, I don't have -- I have very few pictures just laying about --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or like in a box or anything.  Mine are all in albums, all labeled --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- by year.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's great 'cause most people take pictures and then they -- they have these big piles of stuff and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and they have to sift through 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  So, no, mine are together and they're -- and actually I even have my, uh, um, negatives, but -- but negatives aren't nearly as important as they used to be since you can Xerox your pictures off on, uh -- you know, on a color copier, whatever.
L:  Right. Right.
R:  So -- but they used to be highly important because otherwise it was very expensive to, uh, have another copy made of a picture.
L:  Right.  Right.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  So, now, tell me what you do?
L:  Well, I -- two of your hobbies are my hobbies too.  Uh, I didn't realize saving money was a hobby but, uh ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think it is.  I think it is.
L:  Yeah.  Indeed, you're probably right.  I just didn't never put it in that category, but I definitely -- I love to get rebates and, um [LIPSMACK], uh, clip coupons, um, you know, all kinds of ways to save money, um, you know ...?
R:  Now, do you -- have you done any of the Amazon rebates?
L:  No.
R:  They have -- they've had a lot of like software, kids software that's free after rebate, you bought it, and then you've sent in the rebate and it was free.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I haven't.  I haven't -- you know, I haven't looked at Amazon lately.  [LIPSMACK]  I looked at it right after Christmas, but I haven't looked at Amazon lately.  I've been kinda busy.  I haven't been on the Internet as much lately.
R:  Oh, well, I've been -- I spend way too much time on the Internet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's probably my -- that's probably another hobby is the Internet.
L:  Yeah.  It -- it was mine too, but th- these last couple of months I've been trying to get some other things going 'cause I'm thinking about, uh, doing a business.
R:  Ah.
L:  But I don't know what yet.  I -- I just -- I want to do a business on my own.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I don't know what yet.
R:  Well, that's -- that's impressive there.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, we kind of have a business, but I'm not in it.  My husband and his brother and -- and some other people run a restaurant.
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that -- that's big now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  A lotta people go out to eat.
R:  So -- and we're in a small town.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Okay.  But, yeah, and I love reading.  I love reading especially books that are based on a true life story or something.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, that -- I -- I never really got into those.  I like the murder mystery --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- with a little bit of romance thrown in.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Some financial intrigue.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Uh-huh.
R:  And, um -- but what I've really been spending most of my time on now is -- is, uh, the rebates.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I guess like all these office supply stores they have all these phones -- everything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is free after rebate.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Yeah.  So, like Circuit City does, everybody does.
L:  Uh-huh.  Okay.
R:  Office Max.  So, that's what I've been doing.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I've gotten a couple of rebates from Office Max.  My -- my fax machine I got a -- a huge rebate from Office Max and, uh -- but I -- most of my rebates are like Riteaid rebates --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you know, they're not huge but they're -- you know, they come in handy and ...
R:  Well, we don't have a Riteaid, but we have a Walgreen's.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  So, it's kinda the same thing.  So, I do, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- yeah, I do the Walgreen's ones.  I -- that's -- some -- anybody who doesn't do 'em it's kinda silly.
L:  Yeah, I agree and I -- I wish that Walgreen would do what Riteaid is doing.  Riteaid you can do the rebate online.
R:  That would be nice.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If they would all do that that would be the [NOISE] best, wouldn't it?
L:  Yes, it really would.  It really would.
R:  They could all do that, and we could all save our stamps --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then the -- the post office could go bankrupt.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know what?  Somehow I think they never will.  They'll come up with something --
R:  Something.
L:  -- to get the money.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  And we -- we like to travel and plan it.  We do a lot of -- we don't do a lot of traveling, but we go --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- somewhere at least once a year and --
L:  Okay.  I do too.
R:  -- and -- and we -- we, um -- we probably spend two months researching and trying to get the best deals for -- for what we're gonna do --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, the best hotels and the cheapest car rental and --
L:  Right.  I -- I do that too.
R:  -- and, I mean, I spend a lotta time, but if I'm not working -- I mean, I only work part time --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I figure that's -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really I got paid to do that because --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's either spend the money --
L:  Yeah.  Yep.
R:  -- or spend the time.
L:  Exactly.  So, what part of the country are you in?
R:  Uh, from Illinois.
L:  Oh, Illinois.
R:  It's called Ethingham, Illinois.
L:  Okay, yeah.  I have heard of that.  Yeah.
R:  Are you from Chicago then?
L:  [COUGH]
R:  You must be.
L:  Well, I'm familiar with Chicago.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um ...
R:  You've heard of Ethingham?
L:  Yeah, I have.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is amazing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  We're really close to [inaudible].  Have you heard of [inaudible]?  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I've never heard of that one.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's three miles away from Ethingham.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, where are you from then?
L:  I -- well, I've lived a lotta different places in the Midwest.  The last place I came from in the Midwest was Indianapolis. 
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  But right ...
R:  Yeah.  You would've heard of -- of Ethingham 'cause it's right on -- on Seventy.
L:  Okay.  And, um, I've lived in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I've lived in Cleveland, Ohio, and now I'm living in Dover, Delaware, on the east coast.
R:  Oh, gosh!
L:  Yep.
R:  Well, you know what?  The people here there -- there's probably several kids when they go on their senior class trips --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which can only be like twenty four hours, it might be the first time they've been outta the state.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, okay.  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  All right.
R:  Or -- and for sure it's probably over half of them --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- their first time like to go to Chicago or some place like that --
L:  Yeah, a large city.
R:  -- if they go to Chicago.
L:  Yeah.  I can believe that.
R:  Um, they've probably been to St Louis maybe, but ...  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I know when my husband went on his senior trip it was the first time he'd been outta state.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, I mean, obviously twenty seven years ago, but --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but that's, uh -- it is a very small community --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, probably if you ask most of the people there their hobbies would be to know what was going on with their neighbors.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I can believe it.  I -- now, see, I have relatives that are outside of Dover and that's -- that's what goes on in those small towns outside of Dover.  So, yep ...
R:  Well, there's -- he h- -- my husband has fourteen brothers and sisters --
L:  Oh, my goodness, that's big.
R:  -- and, um, that's probably like another hobby.  We do a lotta things with, uh -- with relatives.
L:  With the family, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Don't have -- it's just easier to -- I mean, we do -- we have friends and stuff with --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by the time we do stuff with relatives you got, you know, everything -- on your weekends --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you have any tied up anyway.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I, you know, think -- when I lived in Indianapolis I didn't have any relatives there, just, you know, a few friends.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I -- I have a lot of relatives on the east coast.  So, now I -- I know what you're --
