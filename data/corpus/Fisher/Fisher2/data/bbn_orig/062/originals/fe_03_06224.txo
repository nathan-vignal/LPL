R:  [MN]
L:  And where do you live now?
R:  I'm now, uh, living in Richardson, Texas.
L:  Oh.  
R:  It's pretty close to the Dallas downtown, but it's like in the countryside of the downtown.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So wh- where do you live?
L:  I live in Wyoming.
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  Yeah.  No, Kurt, he's on his four wheeler.  Um, I live in Wyoming.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, geez, I was doing one of my hobbies when I got the call.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  I'm -- I'm putting my garden in for the summer.
R:  Oh, so --
L:  I like to garden.
R:  Y- you like gardening?
L:  Yes.  
R:  Wow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's great.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's kind of fun.
R:  So you must have a very beautiful house?
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  We have a -- we just built our home two years ago.  
R:  [MN]
L:  So building is one of our other hobbies that --
R:  [LAUGH]  +Wow.  
L:  -- end up being very time consuming and so we --
R:  Yeah, I would [MN] --
L:  -- eat, +sleep and breathe for a couple of years.  So ...
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  It -- it overtook our lives.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  You have a lot of flowers in your garden?
L:  Um, right now I'm -- I'm planting my vegetable garden.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Getting my carrots in and my peas.
R:  [MN]
L:  And ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Those kinds of things so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's always fun, to kind a be able to eat what you grow.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  And that's all [LAUGH] natural.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You kind of know what all went on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I -- I missed all the que- -- well I heard 'em but I kind of forgot what all the questions we were supposed to answer.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  We had to --
L:  What are our hobbies?
R:  -- [inaudible] --
L:  And how long -- how much time do you spend doing --
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  -- your hobby?
R:  Yeah.  And, uh, do you think other persons should have one hobby?
L:  At least one.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  At least one.  
R:  Uh-huh.  I think so 'cause you cannot always study, always work.  You need to relax.
L:  Yeah.  Need to find some enjoyment in life.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It goes by way too fast.  
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]  So, [MN], uh, what -- what else have you?
L:  Um, I like to do ebay.  I'm [LAUGH] [MN].
R:  Ebay?
L:  Yes.  Yes.  I'm --
R:  You like the, um, buying stuff there or ...?
L:  I sell a lot of stuff.  I've -- I've --
R:  Really?
L:  -- been a power seller for about two years now.
R:  Well, actually I have, uh, I have purchased something from ebay but never tried to sell something there.  'Cause I heard the procedure is pretty complex.  [MN]  Like you need to register?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And, uh --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  They gonna charge you for fifteen percent of your selling price, right?
L:  Um, it's less than that really.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- well, I don't know the exact percentage.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it goes on like how much you start your bidding at.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, I think anything under ten dollars, maybe.  It's thirty cents.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just to list it.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And then if it sells they charge you a percentage there but it's a really low percentage, especially compared to like, uh, consignment.
R:  Oh.
L:  House or anything.  
R:  Then how can --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they pay you when someone want to, uh, buy your stuff?
L:  You just pay -- you would pay, like, me directly.  
R:  Okay.  
L:  Um, you can pay through paypal or you, um, can send a check or a money order.
R:  Okay.
L:  And it just -- I get paid directly.  And then
R:  Okay.
L:  -- pay- -- or
R:  Mm.
L:  -- ebay takes my fees out of my checking account once a month.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ...  Yeah, but ...
R:  That sounds great.  I should try [LAUGH] it.  Actually I have some -- I have some books I want to sell.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, it's a great -- you know, it's a great place at least to find the value.
R:  Mm.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know.
R:  Yes.
L:  People always can tell you, "Oh, something's worth this amount of money" you know.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And if you find the right person it is, and I think --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- ebay has opened that up so much.  
R:  Okay.
L:  To be able to find collectors.  Especially to me --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in Wyoming.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Actually --
L:  Our population is so small.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My classmate got a laptop from ebay.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's really nice.  And, uh, it says, uh, ninety percent new, but it's actually like brand new so ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And price is very nice.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, very nice.  I have saved and made, you know, so much money.  I've -- one of my other hobbies would be garage saling.
R:  Garage +saling.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And two -- two summers ago it was just a hoot 'cause I'd buy a vase at a garage sale and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- come home and list it on ebay.  You know, I'd buy it for, like --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- three dollars and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- within two hours sell it for twenty bucks.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  So ...
R:  -- great.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, I had a ball that summer.  But --
R:  Uh-huh. 
L:  -- then my husband got a little miffed by all the stuff that's sort of piling up that I didn't list so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Actually I have a lot of stuff.  Like I got a small radio, but recently I got a mini hi fi.  I want to sell the radio.  I just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- don't know how to sell [LAUGH] it.
L:  Oh, you know, it -- it -- if you just -- if you look at the whole thing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it looks just overwhelming, but if you just take it in bite size pieces and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, eventually you get there to where it's just -- 
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  It's just easy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Once you get set up.  But it's -- it's -- so many people are afraid --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to start.  
R:  So you made a lot of money from ebay?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah. 
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  I've made a lot.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Which is very nice 'cause some hobbies are very expensive.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And it's nice to have one that I actually make money out.
R:  Yeah.  I was --
L:  My husband --
R:  -- thinking about to find a way to make money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, it's awesome.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's -- it's a lot of fun to sell --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- on ebay.
R:  And especially, uh, that's your hobby so you have fun and you earn money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I have a ball.  
R:  Okay.
L:  And then my other thing I do, I sell Avon.  
R:  [MN]
L:  And that's more of a hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it's a job too and it's -- it's very fun.  I --
R:  You -- you sell what?  I'm sorry.
L:  Avon?
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  So I'm -- I'm probably a hobby addict really.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And the amount of time that I spend doing my hobbies is probably sixteen hours a day.  [LAUGH] 
R:  +Wow.  That's great.  You know, I like travelling, I like watching movies, but I guess I only spend, like -- well I ha- I haven't been watching any movie in the last month.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Can you believe that?
L:  Yeah.
R:  The study just kept me busy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I go --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- through phases.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Sometimes I watch movies and movies and movies and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- then other times it's like, "Wow, it's been months".  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  Sometimes I just feel, okay, if I spend time on my hobbies it's [MN] like wasting my time because I have to study.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But when I just simply keep myself studying I feel so tired.  I really need some relax.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So you're a student?
R:  Yeah, I'm --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a doctor student.
L:  Oh, my.  Yeah, your --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- time is limited, isn't it?
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]
L:  And what year are you in college?  [MN]
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  What year are you?  How many years have you been going to school?
R:  Uh, you mean the doctor program?  
L:  Yes.
R:  Uh, only one year.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Only one year.  Oh my.
R:  I have to do, like, four -- four years to go.  
L:  Oh.  
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, how admirable.  [MN]
R:  Um, people will have the degree like, uh, average four to five years.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's just depends on -- on the person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I don't know.  You -- you never get that time back though either so I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- think pushing yourself too hard, I don't know --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes.
L:  -- if that's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [MN] hard to ...
R:  Mhm. [MN]  Well, I like shopping.
L:  Oh.  Oh, me too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Uh, they say that [MN] um, women they always feel they -- they lack when [inaudible], no matter how much they have.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  There's always one more pair of shoes you can have.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  And, uh, uh [MN] everytime I got this -- like [MN] the discount a- advertisement or [MN] things on sale I got excited.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I [several inaudible words] day they have thirty percent [MN] off the total regular price, I got --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- excited.  [LAUGH]  I really --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- want to go shopping.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  And the --
L:  If it's half price you should probably have two.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And everytime I got a lot of stuff back, but once I, uh, ride home I think, okay, well, actually I don't -- I really don't need those [LAUGH] stuff.
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  But it's nice to treat yourself.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]  It is.  I -- I've been trying to thin down my clothes.  I've been trying when it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- got a hole in it or a stain it goes in the rag box.  But ...
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Because I get on a kick and I can't seem to stop either.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  If it's on sale I probably need two.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]  So ...
R:  And I guess on [inaudible] day they have a lot of stuff?
L:  Uh.  
R:  Oh, usually I go to -- I -- I would like to go to those outlets.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Those -- oh, those'll get --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you in trouble. 
R:  Mhm.

R:  I'm sorry?
L:  Your accent?  
R:  Accent?

R:  Yeah.  Actually I'm Chinese.

R:  I was born in Shanghai.  Have you ever heard about Shanghai?
L:  Sh-
