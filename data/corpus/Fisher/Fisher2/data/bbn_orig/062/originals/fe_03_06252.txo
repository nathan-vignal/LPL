R:  Okay.  This is Karen.
L:  That's kinda funny.  This is Karen as well.
R:  Is it really?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I wonder if they planned that.  [LAUGH]  Oh, so what did you think of the question?
L:  Finally one I can do.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  Okay.  So, you have hobbies?
L:  I have a couple, yeah.
R:  Well, tell me about 'em.
L:  Um, I love scrap booking, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- I've kinda gotten into that one last year.
R:  Okay.
L:  I also love sewing and I guess my latest hobby is coupons.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  How do -- what do you mean?
L:  Online trading different ones and stuff, just to kinda cut my costs on groceries.
R:  Okay.  That's interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, do you -- do you spend a lot of time pursuing these things?
L:  Um, yes and no.  I spend what time I have.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Which is not a whole lot.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  So, you've got children then?
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Okay.  Just busy, huh?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, it's funny 'cause when I thought of hobbies I -- at first I didn't -- I thought I don't have any of 'em.  But there's -- you know, I stay busy all day long and I never think of like couponing as a hobby, but I guess it is and I tend to do a lot of that myself.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You have to in today's world.
R:  And I spend -- I mean, I spend a whole lot of time like, you know, trying to make a better life [LAUGH] --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and, um -- by, you know, reading what's going on in town and trying to schedule things and find good prices on things and I'm -- you know, and I guess that is a hobby because I really get into it.  There are times when I'm trying to plan a trip where I spend like five or six hours sitting at my desk on the telephone and that doesn't seem like any time at all that's gone by.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Kinda drifts -- but I guess travel is a hobby, isn't it?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Okay.  Well, we do that one for sure.  When I was a kid I remember, um, they had asked us, um -- and I think I was in the second grade or something -- they asked us to bring in our hobbies, um, to school like the following week and I went home and I told my Dad, "I don't have a hobby.  I don't know what to do" and so I started stamp collecting because what you could do is you could buy those packages of stamps --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- and I could put it together real fast and it looked like I had a hobby and, you know, when I got to school I finally found out that they didn't mean everybody, just if you had a hobby you could bring it in.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, no!
R:  I know.  But anyway, so I'd gone to all that trouble.  I'd put my -- you know, my parents through hell and everything.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah, I guess I had never thought of, you know, the things I do as -- as hobbies, but they -- they are.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], you know, the scrap booking is interesting.  My, um, boyfriend's daughter is into it, like in a big way.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  She does these huge parties, you know, where they'll have like twenty, thirty women there and she just -- you know, she's at the top of the food chain as far as selling stamping equipment --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and, uh, she keeps a whole room in her house dedicated to that.  So, it's like a serious career to her.  She makes about two thousand dollars a month on it.
L:  Oh, my!
R:  I'm serious.  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I definitely don't make anything on it [LAUGH], for sure.
R:  You just do it for the pleasure, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I -- honestly I -- I have, um, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue.  So, I don't have that much time to do things I enjoy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I'm trying to change that a little.
R:  Are you really?
L:  Yeah, I am.  I've --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I'm done.  I've had it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So --
R:  Oh, God!
L:  -- it's time for some me time.
R:  It seems to me like hobbies are a great idea 'cause I think anything that, um, you can get lost in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- is good for you physically.
L:  Yep.  I think so too.
R:  Um, so I always thought -- you know, I used to read that Centurions had that characteristic.  They, um -- that they had some sort of a vocation and I guess a hobby would fall into that category, um, but something that they actually just love doing, they do it for free, and they just, um, you know -- and -- and they get lost in it, and so I thought, you know, it's -- it's a real important thing to have in your life, whether you're a hundred years old or, you know, thirty, whatever.  So ...  But, you know, I guess -- I've done biking riding.  I was really into that for a while.  Um, I even did weightlifting for a while, uh, but that hurt my back.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, did yoga for a little while, um, but same thing, I tried to get my back straight on that and it turns out I'm just a person that doesn't really need to exercise that much.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Um, have you tried any other hobbies?
L:  Um, I have.  I used to do a lot of like working out at the gym and aerobics and stuff.  I don't do as much of that anymore.
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  Um, I used to love skiing.
R:  Snow skiing?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
L:  Maine.
R:  So, you get cold weather?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Okay.  See, we live in North Carolina.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, yeah.  They've got mountains here and, you know, I used to go skiing a lot.  I used to do the alps and -- out west.  Um, North Carolina skiing isn't that great.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  But, um, I had a daughter, uh, and she's gonna turn eight and this winter I thought about taking her up there and getting her started and then we got up there ...
L:  She's at a good age.
R:  Yeah.  It would be great though.
L:  Get her started on a hobby.
R:  Oh, yeah, for sure.  She seems to have those.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know, kids you have to get 'em involved in things.
L:  Yeah, you do.
R:  So, she's like -- she's on the swim team and, you know, she does piano lessons and things like that.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  In fact, um [LIPSMACK], my boyfriend plays the piano to the point where he -- he gets completely mesmerized by it --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and he writes his own songs and ...
L:  I would love to have a hobby like that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Yeah.  See, and when I saw him doing that I realized that, um, if my daughter had, you know, any talent at all that she would enjoy that for the rest of her life --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- because I see him, you know, whenever there's just a few minutes he'll go and sit down and start playing and sing and everything and, uh, man, he comes back and he's just like completely renewed and --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- I don't play any musical instruments and I always wondered, you know, what that would be like.  So, I got her started in piano lessons and she loves it too.  I find her playing, you know, before bed and when she first gets up in the morning and things like that.  Do you play a musical instrument?
L:  I used to play the clarinet in high school.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  And I -- I lost -- I -- I lost that a long, long time ago.  It's one of those things if you don't keep it up --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you lose it.
R:  Is that true?
L:  Yeah.  It was for me anyway.
R:  Wow!  Hm, that's interesting.  Are you married?
L:  Yes, I am.
R:  Does he have any hobbies?
L:  Um, yes, he loves his little baseball cards.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh, that's a hoot!
L:  My Lord, yes.
R:  [LAUGH] Does he make money on it?
L:  Um, no, he just collects them.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  He's got a huge collection.
R:  [MN] You're serious?
L:  Yes, and every time I turn around the corner in the bedroom I nail my foot on one of 'em.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  On one of the big boxes under the bed, I'm like ow!
R:  Oh, my God!
L:  And they're sealed so it really hurts.  [LAUGH]
R:  That is really funny.  Oh, gosh!  Well, are you doing this mystery shopping stuff, or are you just doing the, uh -- the phone calls?
L:  I would love to get into the mystery shopping thing, but I haven't had any luck yet.
R:  Well, see, I started that in January and at first it didn't take off.  But, um, within about three months they started coming in pretty hard.
L:  Oh, good.
R:  And I'm not sure what that was about, but it's -- so I seem to be spending a lotta time on that now.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's good.  Do you make money?
R:  Well, it feels like a hobby because it's really -- you know, it's not a lotta money.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's ten dollars here, ten dollars there.  But, um ...
L:  Oh, well, that's good.
R:  And what I do is I try to pick the ones that are convenient, like the grocery store or a restaurant.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I try not to do anything that I wouldn't normally do.
L:  Right.  And I think that's really what -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think that's really great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, now, have you gotten paid for doing the surveys yet?
R:  Um, for these I got paid for one and it takes a long time to get payment.
L:  Really?
R:  I can't remember if it was -- let's see, it must've been the beginning of March and I just got paid for that one --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- or something like that and, uh -- and I did another one this month, about a week ago, and then I'm doing this one.  This will be my third one.
L:  Is there any limit on how many you can do?
R:  You know, at first I had read that three was the limit.
L:  Yep.
R:  But I have a feeling that if you put in different phone numbers you can get more than three.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um [LIPSMACK], I -- I wasn't so clear on it 'cause I didn't spend that much time reading it.  I figured after I got to three I'd go and check back on that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, yeah, they're --
L:  This is my third.
R:  -- they're pretty easy, aren't they?  But, yeah, you get paid.  [LAUGH]
L:  Good.
R:  It's kinda amazing.
L:  That's kinda -- I call that a hobby too.
R:  Yes.  It -- it does seem like a hobby, doesn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  In fact I told, uh, some of the kids in my daughter's school.  They had had me in to ask -- tell them what I do for money --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I brought that up and they were fascinated by that.
L:  Oh, I bet!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You, what?
R:  I'm ...
L:  You talk on the phone and make money?  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  You know, they said, "Oh, we wanna be just like you" you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  And I -- and it's such a good feeling too, like when I go to the grocery store and I've used coupons that I've traded with people online --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, you know, I -- the cashier yesterday at that grocery store was -- she was like "I want you to do my groceries".
R:  [MN]
L:  I saved -- you know, at the bottom of the slip it says how much you saved and I saved forty six percent.
R:  Did you really?
L:  [LAUGH] I did.
R:  Wow!
L:  She's like oh, my!
R:  See, that's amazing.
L:  And I kept handing her more coupons and I was like these are the triple ones, these are the double ones.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, my goodness!
L:  She's like holy crap!
R:  Yeah.  You know, I did that.  I remember years ago I was doing some of that and, um [LIPSMACK], I had gone to the grocery store and I got my groceries for, uh, somewhere around half of what they were, you know, rung up at and I brought the register receipt home and my husband put it in our cupboard and he brought it out all the time to show it to people.  He was so impressed after that.  [LAUGH]  He had no idea it could be done.  But, you know what?  It takes a lotta time, doesn't it?
L:  You know what?  It really does.
R:  Yeah.  You know, have to like it.  [LAUGH]  That's the thing.  'Cause most people -- like, my boyfriend now he would just think that's insane and it's a big waste of time, he'd just be totally uninterested in that.  But for me it's almost like a little game, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, exactly.  My husband -- my husband used to think that until I won a pair of Reeboks --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- entering a contest on line.
R:  Really?  [LAUGH]
L:  He's like you what?  [LAUGH]  I was like yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  Or when I hand him movie tickets for him to go the movies for free or --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, he like holy shit!
R:  See.
L:  I'm like yeah, I love it.
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  And he's like okay, I don't pick on you anymore.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's right.  There -- there are advantages for sure.  Oh, wow!  That's pretty neat.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I don't know.
