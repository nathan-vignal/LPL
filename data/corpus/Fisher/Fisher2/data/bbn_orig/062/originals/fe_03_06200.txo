L:  Hello, my name's Beth.
R: Hello, my name's Angie. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, where do you live, Angie?
R: Um, east Texas, um, Overton, Texas actually.  Where do you live?
L:  I'm in [MN] south -- southeast Georgia on the coast.
R: Southeast Georgia, I've never been there. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, Jacksonville, Florida, we're just -- just north of Jacksonville.
R: Uh, well, I've only been to Florida once, I've probably passed there very close.
L:  Okay. [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.
R: This is -- I'm kinda nervous --
L:  Well --
R:  -- I've never [LAUGH] done this, my sister got me into this. [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I've never done it either, this is my first call so I guess --
R: My [LAUGH] --
L:  -- I need to ask you, what is your hobby?
R: Oh my gosh!  I don't know! [LAUGH]  Um, I really don't have any, um --
L:  You do coupons, I know you --
R: I don't have a lotta time for myself actually, so --
L:  I -- I know you do coupons.
R: I don't.
L:  You don't do coupons?
R: I don't. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay, your sister must.  Somebody does coupons that got you hooked into this, I bet.
R: [LAUGH] No, [MN] -- no, my sister doesn't do coupons but she's always on the computer trying to find just stupid things to do and little ways to [MN], uh, earn money and -- 'cause she's a stay at home mom too and, um, I think it's just to occupy her time! [LAUGH]
L:  Okay, so her hobby is computers then, how about you?
R: Oh, I w- -- oh gosh.  I really don't know.
L:  You don't do computers either?
R: No, I hate computers.  I don't ever touch it.
L:  [MN]
R: Uh, we have one, my husband is on it too much and I actually threatened to beat it with a baseball bat most the time [LAUGH] --
L:  So your hobby is baseball.
R: 'Cause I hate it, it takes away from my family time.
L:  [inaudible] --
R: It just takes away from our family time.  But no, I -- I actually like to exercise.  Um, [LIPSMACK] sometimes I get a chance to do that.  I was a member of a fitness center [SIGH], um, I actually still am, I just haven't got a chance to go 'cause my husband's schedule is so weird at work that I can't hardly find time 'cause I have three boys and no one will babysit and you know, [SIGH] that -- that -- that's something I enjoy doing though --
L:  [MN]
R: -- is aerobics.
L:  And how old are your boys?
R: Oh, eight and a half, um, one just turned -- well, t- he -- he's thr- -- eight and a half, three and a half, and one just turned two.
L:  Oh my.  I have three boys that are seven --
R: You have three boys?
L:  I have three boys, they're seven, nine and eleven.  Over the summer they'll turn eight, ten and twelve.
R: Oh my gosh.
L:  Yeah.  So it will pass --
R: That's weird, we both --
L:  -- they will get older and people will watch them! [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH] Well, yeah, 'cause right now the -- I guess the two and the -- the eight and a half year old, now he's easy to watch, but the, um, the two and the three year old, they're -- they're into everything.
L:  Oh.
R: And they're crazy. [LAUGH]
L:  I bet they are.
R: They're [inaudible] --
L:  So your hobby is keeping them out of everything.
R: Pretty much.
L:  [LAUGH]
R: That's all I have time to do.  The other day I was in the shower and I got out and I got in just long enough to take a shower and I was at home alone with them and my husband was at work and, uh, my other one was at school, and I got out and they painted the whole kitchen with d- --
L:  Oh no.
R: -- they had got it out of the kitchen and, yeah, the refrigerator and squirted everywhere. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh no.
R: It took me a while to clean it up.
L:  And so cleaning and diapers, that's a good hobby for you, right.
R: Yeah, yeah.  But what's yours?  What d- --
L:  Well, I do do coupons and rebates and all that.  And I also -- we have, uh, we've moved into a house where we have horses.
R: Oh.
L:  So we r- -- we ride horses.  But I'm laid up a little bit, I, um, [LIPSMACK] broke my back a couple of weeks ago but I'm up and about, I have --
R: Broke your back?
L:  Yeah.  And my three ribs.  Yeah, seven b- broken vertebrae.  We had sent one off to be broke.  For two months -- he was gone for two months.  Rode him up there, he was beautiful.  Got it back here and went [inaudible] maniac and --
R: [SIGH]
L:  -- dr- -- rode -- we always -- he ran full blast to the fence and then he turned and turned and which knocked me into the fence and --
R: Oh my --
L:  -- I fell off into the fence.  Which in itself, it sounds terrible, but that's a blessing because it broke my -- I have clean breaks all the, uh, on seven vertebrae.
R: Ooh.
L:  Which if I had hit the ground it could've been disk compression, slipped disk and all that stuff and there would've been surgery and lots worse than I am.
R: Oh my gosh.
L:  So I'm wearing a turtle shell and they asked me if I'm gonna ride again and of course I'm gonna ride again.
R: Wow!
L:  That's, [MN] you know!
R: [LAUGH]
L:  Again, I -- I need three months to get out of this little shell thing but after that I'll be back u- -- back up and at 'em.
R: Oh my Lord.  What [MN] --
L:  But I guess if they -- what they say, if you're a horse person you're a horse person, you're gonna do it.
R: Mm.
L:  So that's --
R: That sounds horrible though, I mean, that's -- it's reminding me of [MN] what just happened the other day, one of my sister's, uh, best friends, her dad got killed, though he got bucked off a mule, and he hit, um, the ground wrong and broke, I guess, his neck --
L:  Oh no.
R: -- or something, but he died.  And that's why when you just started talking about that I -- then when you said it could be worse I was like, well, yeah, but [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R: -- you just don't -- you just don't want anything like that to happen, that's -- that's not good.  That's horrible, I'm so sorry about that.
L:  Well, that is just [inaudible].
R: Oh, I don't think I'd be getting back on [LAUGH] though!  That's how I am.  I'd be like, "No, never again".
L:  Well, my husband took that horse down and he did it, he's been lunging him for about forty five minutes, which they run it in the round pen, he's on a rope and he just runs for forty five minutes.
R: Wow!
L:  And then he's such a good little fellow! [LAUGH]
R: Golly!
L:  He's a -- a tad bit tired and he's just been as k- -- he's gotten on his back and he's been such a good little fella after that.
R: Wow. [LAUGH]
L:  So I guess that's the key, is to wear 'em out and then you can ride 'em, so --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  But we have three other full sized horses so I'll probably spend a lotta time on them before I ever get back on that one again.
R: Yeah, yeah.
L:  As a matter of fact, my husband said he didn't want anybody else on, "This is my horse" and so he said he's gonna be on his horse.
R: Mm.
L:  So --
R: I don't even know how you find time with the three boys! [LAUGH]
L:  Well, they e- --
R: Even though they're older than mine, to do any- --
L:  Yeah, they each have a -- a pony.
R: Wow.
L:  So if we wanna ride we can -- and I -- I tell you what, there's a secret.  My secret is, I'm a morning person.
R: Mhm.
L:  And at night, um, with the weekends and the summer --
R: Mhm.
L:  I -- of course this won't work as well for your little ones, but I let mine stay up as late as they want to.  Now, they have a bedroom time.
R: Yeah.
L:  "I'm sorry, you've gotta be in your room.  You can watch TV, you can play, but in your room".
R: Wow.
L:  So they go to their rooms, they stay up as late as they want, they go to sleep when they want to.
R: In the summer. [LAUGH]
L:  Then they sleep -- then -- right.  Then they sleep in.  Now, I'm a morning person, I get up early.
R: So that's your time! [LAUGH]
L:  Right, right.  I get up early and I have three hours or so all by myself.
R: Wow.
L:  So I can get -- I can do what I want, I can get the house cleaned, 'cause you know -- a- and you probably gonna feel the same way, housework is a competition and the kids usually win?
R: [LIPSMACK] Yeah.
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R: My house [MN] -- I used to actually be boss.
L:  [MN]
R: They thought I was obsessive compulsive because my house was so perfect.  I mean --
L:  Right. [LAUGH]
R: -- I'm a perfectionist so I used to just completely be just crazy about my house.  Now, it -- I'm just the opposite, I -- I completely just gave up one day, I -- 
L:  [LAUGH]
R: -- 'cause I couldn't keep up with 'em.
L:  Right.
R: I couldn't keep -- a- as soon as I'd make the bed, they'd tear all the sheets off and the comforter off.  As soon as I mop the kitchen floor they would purposely go spill something on it.
L:  Okay! [LAUGH]
R: I mean, it was just -- it was just a neverending -- so now, I mean, it takes -- I, uh, it's horrible, my house is horrible and once in a while I'll clean something. [LAUGH]
L:  It's decorated in early childhood.
R: Oh, it's horrible.
L:  [LAUGH]
R: And I know it will be better, and I want it to be clean because that's my personality, I'm a clean freak, but as soon as they get older I know that they won't be making these stupid messes and, um -- 'cause, uh, ju- -- [MN] the o- other thing was two days ago, um, again, in the shower.  Um, this is when they get the mo- -- the worst stuff done.  I was in the shower, I got out and my littlest one had got in the bathroom cabinet and we had a blue Sparkle Crest toothpaste --
L:  Mhm.
R: Kids' toothpaste.
L:  We've seen that. [LAUGH]
R: He's squirted the entire tube in the carpet in the living room.
L:  Oh no.
R: All over the place.  I mean, my carpet was then bright blue.
L:  Oh no.
R: Sparkly bright blue.  It took me forever to get it out.  And see, that's what I'm talking about.  I can't keep my house clean.  So, I -- I gave up.  I just said, "Well, forget it.  Y'all just tear it up and I'll buy new carpet when you get older --"
L:  Right.
R: "-- I'll buy new floor, I'll buy -- I'll c- have somebody come in and paint all my walls, 'cause they've colored and markered everything.
L:  Decor- --
R: Everything.
L:  Decorated in early childhood. 
R: Yes, it's horrible.
L:  That's all you can say.
R: It's horrible.
L:  And -- and I think everybody who's been through this understands. 
R: Mm.  But it does, it looks bad, and people come over and I go, "Well, if you love me you're just gonna have to look past my house".
L:  Right.
R: Because, you know --
L:  And your car! [LAUGH]
R: Mm.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, yeah.
R: Oh m- yeah.  Yeah.  My husband bought me a -- a two thousand three, um, Trailblazer.
L:  Oh no.
R: A [inaudible] Trailblazer, for Christmas.  That was my Christmas present.  Oh, hold on, my mom's here.  [NOISE]  Oh.
L:  Well, you just can't have a --
R: Hey, Momma.
L:  -- new car with little kids and expect it to be clean.
R: Yeah!  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, if they can't ride in it.  [LAUGH]
R: But it's horrible.  My Trailblazer, yeah.  It's so nasty inside right now.  And I said -- when I got it for Christmas I said, "Oh, you know, I'm gonna keep it all nice and clean --"
L:  Yeah! [LAUGH]
R: "-- and perfect and everything".  And, oh, it's just terrific.
L:  Your seat probab- -- your seat probably is. [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH] Well, this -- yeah, my seat is.  But theirs -- th- they're -- they're into this kick, uh, they chew gum now and then they'll stick it somewhere in there.
L:  Oh no.
R: They'll take it outta their mouth while we're going down the road and just put it somewhere and I'm finding, um, in the heat, you know, the melted gum --
L:  Oh no.
R: -- everywhere.  Yeah, it's not -- it's not fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh. [LAUGH] 
R: Like I said, they're just -- they're crazy.
L:  And your husband didn't expect this?
R: No.  No, I guess not. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R: I guess he thought -- well, actually his rules were, um, "We're not going to, um, [LIPSMACK] eat in it". [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Mhm.
R: "And we're not gonna drink in it".  And I said, "Then -- well how we gonna do that 'cause when we're in Tyler shopping all day or something we've got to go, um, to McDonald's --"
L:  And nobody --
R: "-- and we're not gonna pile out and, you know, we're gonna be eating fries and little Happy Meals and everything and, um --"
L:  Nobody's gonna leak outta their diaper in it
R: Yeah!
L:  [LAUGH]
R: Or nobody's gonna throw up or, you know!
L:  Right! [LAUGH]
R: You know, anything.  And it is -- he -- I guess he was in a dream world thinking, "No, this one's gonna be kept clean and perfect" and I think it's been washed on the outside once and [LAUGH] I think I've vacuumed it twice on the inside and --
L:  Yeah, I have a n- -- a Grand Marquee and that's the same rules as ours, "You can't eat, you can't do this".
R: [LAUGH]
L:  And I also bought at our church au- -- it was an auction, a little eighty five Toyota that's a little stick shift and drives fine.
R: Mhm.
L:  And air conditioner works, and I only spent seven hundred and fifty dollars on it.
R: Oh wow.
L:  And I love it because the kids can eat in it.
R: Yeah.
L:  We don't have to go by all those rules.
R: [SIGH]
L:  And, you know, it's like, we're going on a three hour trip and nobody can eat or drink or --
R: [LAUGH]
L:  -- breath or ... [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  And then it's like, "Don't scratch the car.  Don't open the door".  It's like, "Get in the Toyota and let's just do what we wanna do!"
R: Yeah!
L:  [LAUGH]
R: [LAUGH]
L:  So that's, yeah, that's --
R: Oh, that's funny.
L:  I, as I said, I got my -- I got my nice car
