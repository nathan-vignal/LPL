I think everybody needs at least one hobby so that they don't, you know, get bored and go crazy, not dealing with the boring things in life. [LAUGH]  What about you, what are your hobbies?
L:  Uh, I -- I like, uh, um, building stuff like electronic -- electronic stuff like ro- robots and, uh, um, guns and stuff.
R:  Oh cool.  Well, I gotta lotta other hobbies too.  I like to watch movies, I like to, uh, go hiking and just a lotta things.  I'll go bicycle riding, go for a walk, long walks in the park.  Just anything to -- to take my mind off the routine of the day, when I have time that is.  My other hobbies is --
L:  [inaudible].
R:  -- sometimes I like to do a lotta cooking.  Do you like to cook?
L:  Uh, yes, I do.  I also like to listen to, uh, the radio and the records.

L:  Um, um, rock and roll, love music and, uh, rock music.
R:  You like Bruce Springsteen?  That's rock.
L:  I -- I --
R:  My husband loves Bruce Springsteen, that's his favorite, so that's why I was asking.
L:  Uh, all sorts of rock music.
R:  All sorts?  I like any kind of music, as long as it's, um, popular.  Anything that's popular.  I like rock, reggae, rap, anything.  I like oldies, newies! [LAUGH]  It's all good to me, as long as it's something popular that I can, uh, you know, catch onto the words so I can --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- sing too.  [LAUGH] [PAUSE]  So, what e- -- what else -- what other kinda things do you like to do?  Do you like to go out dancing or ...?  I like to go out dancing.  I like to go to the club and listen to a different kind of music and sometimes I can't even dance to the music but it's good to just listen sometimes.  [PAUSE]
L:  Oh.  Be quiet, that's not about something, excuse me.  Oh, oh, um, I like to hang out, uh, by myself.
R:  Oh.
L:  Go to, um, uh, places to walk around.
R:  Oh, so you don't -- you'd rather be closer to home, be by yourself and not spend a lotta time with a big crowd of people and stuff like that?
L:  Uh, uh, yes I do.
R:  So that you probably like to read books too?  You like to read books?
L:  Uh, yes, I do.
R:  I usually end up reading all the stuff that my kids are reading, like that Harry Potter stuff or whatever. [LAUGH]  I usually don't get to read a lot of adult books, I end up having to read all the good stuff in the newspaper during the day because all the books in my house are kiddie books.  Huh.
L:  I also like to, um, work at home.
R:  What do you like to do in the house?  What kind of things?
L:  Huh?
R:  What kinda -- what kinda things do you like to do at home?  What kind?
L:  Uh, work at home, b- um, receive magazines from companies and, um ... uh, uh, get a job.
R:  Oh, cool.  That's a good way to -- to get a new job, to stay fresh.  You just stay home and look through the paper and -- and you could use your hobbies as your job sometimes.  Sometimes people, uh, like to do a certain thing and it becomes their job.  Some people like to talk to a lotta people and they become a -- a club promoter or whatever.  Sometimes that could end up being your job.  I like to work with children, I could become a babysitter that way.  My hobby could become my job.
L:  Myself collect money.  Uh, I like to collect money.
R:  Oh, coins or -- or regular green dollars?
L:  Uh, both.
R:  Yeah, me too.  My father has a old coin collection and sometimes he sends me coins.  Uh, my husband gave me a nineteen twenty seven silver coin, it's really cool.  It was so pretty I was getting ready to make a necklace out of it. [LAUGH]  And my other hobby, I have, um, [LIPSMACK] a baseball card collection, I like to collect baseball cards.  I'm not really into it but I have so many that I don't know what to do other than just keep a collection of them.  I have about twenty thousand baseball cards, so I collect them.  I don't have any Babe Ruth or anything great like Mickey Mantle or anything, but I do have some really cool cards, like most of the recent players like [inaudible] and stuff like this.
L:  Oh, uh, baseball cards.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah, that's one of my hobbies, to collect the baseball cards. I  don't know what else to do with them, I don't [SIGH] -- I never look at them, I just store them in the boxes and collect 'em and they collect dust, but I collect 'em.  But it's like, I guess it's fun.  My little boys, when they get older they want to collect baseball cards, I'll already have a big collection for them and I can just give it to them and they could start from there.  They'll have all their favorite players from the Yankees or whatever. [PAUSE]  So what e- -- what -- what else kinda things do you like to do?
L:  Watch television.

Um, Six Feet Under, it's a little weird, it's about people that die and pe- people that pass away, they have a show about it.  It's very strange.

L:  Um ... uh, I, um, hmm ... I also like to read newspapers.
