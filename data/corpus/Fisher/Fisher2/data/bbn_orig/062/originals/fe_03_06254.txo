R:  I love it.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I love kids.
R:  Yeah.  Me too, I guess that'll be a good hobby too, huh?
L:  Oh, that's more than a hobby.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  A hobby you can quit and do something else, but --
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  -- children you can't.  So, what, do we just talk for ten minutes?  Is ...?
R:  You know what?  I have no idea.  I got -- I'm on the coupon club.
L:  The what?
R:  It's called, um, Best Coupon where we trade coupons and stuff.
L:  Oh -- oh, okay.
R:  And they posted this.  So, I went and, you know, wrote my name on and everything and I read about it, but I didn't really -- I just figured it was like a survey like you would take over the Internet --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and like, "Well, have you tried say, natural health coffee?  Did you like it?" blah, blah, blah.
L:  Well, that's what I thought it was.
R:  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I'm completely lost.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, a friend of mine had, uh, recommended this to me and she said she -- she made thirty dollars just talking about, you know, different things that they tell ya to talk about.
R:  Oh, well --
L:  So ...
R:  -- maybe it'll be easy money for us.
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  You get to talk, to meet people and ...
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  Yeah.  Hey, I get to talk to an adult instead of a child.  [LAUGH]
L:  There you go!  [LAUGH]
R:  But I didn't know I would talk to just somebody like me, you know?  I thought I would talk to a representative or ...
L:  Well, that's what I thought.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I -- I had no idea.  Nobody -- my friend never told me exactly what was involved in it, you know, just that they ask -- you know, they give you a topic to talk about and ...
R:  And I wonder what they're gonna gain.
L:  I don't ...
R:  You know what I mean?  I wonder what they're gonna gain by us talking.  I don't -- I don't get that.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  Well, I guess if, uh, our topic is hobbies we -- what kind of cooking do you like?  We'll talk about hobbies.  What kind of cooking ...?
R:  Okay.  Cooking, I am into southern cooking mostly because I lived in North Carolina for about nine years.
L:  Oh, my son lives in -- in North Carolina.
R:  Oh, yeah?  I lived in --
L:  Outside of Greensborough.
R:  Oh, I lived outside of Wilmington.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well ...
R:  But, um, I worked in a seafood restaurant as a waitress when I was in school and outta school after work --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and so everything tasted so good there because they made home cooked stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and so I'm into trying all kinds of new recipes, but I have to have the baking grease and, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh -- oh, okay.
R:  It's not like good food for you.
L:  It's full of cholesterol, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.
L:  Yeah.  Well -- and you do quite a bit of this kind of cooking or ...?
R:  Oh, yes.
L:  Oh.
R:  My husband's gained eighty five pound in like three years.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  So, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's good 'cause he was skinny as a rail.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, do you do different, like Italian and different stuff like that or ...?
L:  Oh, I love to -- I love Italian food and I make that and I make, uh [LIPSMACK] -- let's see.  We -- we like to go out to eat too.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Me too.
L:  [LAUGH] But we're both thin and trying to stay that way.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  So, staying at home and cooking probably helps too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, uh, I don't know.  I -- I like to bake and I like to try different recipes.  But I always go back to the old ones.
R:  Me too.  Me too.
L:  Things my mother taught me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  Well, I went to a home and garden party and they had a bean pot and the lady was telling me about how you pot roast in it, pour a can of Coca Cola, just a plain can of Coke into it, and a can of cream of mushroom soup.
L:  Oh, my!
R:  You don't have to stir it or nothing.  You put the lid on it and cook it for three hours and you wouldn't believe ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, that is so easy and it is the best gravy and pot roast I've ever had in my life.
L:  Oh, for crying out loud!
R:  I bought a bean pot and I've cooked like three different ...
L:  What is a bean pot in comparison to another -- soup pot?
R:  It's probably the same thing.
L:  [COUGH] Okay.  'Cause we don't call them bean pots up here.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I didn't --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- even know what a bean pot was until she ...  See if I wouldn't have went to this party I would've never bought one.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But oh, my!  Just great.
L:  Well, I make something similar.  I use a, uh -- a brisket --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- a, uh ...
R:  Corn beef brisket?
L:  Well, not corn beef.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's without the spices on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and it's just a plain p- uh, meat brisket and I use, uh, ketchup --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- with, uh, some pepper and onions and, you know, salt and pepper on it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it -- and you cook it for four hours.  I do it in two stages.  I cook it for two hours, let it cool and slice it up and put it in the fridge, and then when I'm ready to eat it I put it in for another two hours already sliced up and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- oh, it's just out of this world.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I bet.  That sounds good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I'll have to try that.
L:  So, uh, and then I throw potatoes in it too so that you got the potatoes also in there.
R:  Right, easier that way.
L:  It's a one pot meal.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  But, uh, I -- you know, I like to cook different things and lasagna and stir fry's.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  We eat, you know, a lot of stir fry's and I like salads, macaroni and tuna fish salad and shrimp and --
R:  My husband hates ...
L:  -- stuff like that.
R:  My husband does not like [LAUGH] macaroni salad with tuna in it --
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- at all.  No.  We got a recipe from his aunt that had -- it takes, um, evaporated milk and sugar and eggs and macaroni and it's really pretty simple, but it's the best macaroni salad I've ever had 'cause I was raised on macaroni salad with tuna fish in it.
L:  Oh, I love it.  I love it.
R:  And he hates it.  So ...
L:  Oh, that's too bad.  [LAUGH]
R:  [COUGH] He just -- I don't know.  He loves tuna.  He just doesn't like it in a salad.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  You use mayonnaise or ...?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh.
R:  Mayonnaise, sugar, salt and pepper, mustard --
L:  Oh, see, I don't --
R:  -- evaporated milk.
L:  -- I don't use all that stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Just mayonnaise with a little bit of salt and pepper and --
R:  Tuna.
L:  -- and some onions in there.
R:  If you put some peas in.  If you like peas it's good with peas too.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But he doesn't like it that way.  So ...  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Well, I -- I -- I put, uh -- cut up tomatoes and, uh, cucumbers in it.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yep.
L:  So it's, you know, nice on a -- on a hot night or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- afternoon or it's good for, uh, leftovers for lunch.
R:  Yeah.  My great grandma used to -- I used to watch her cook all the time when -- when I was little --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and she just made everything from scratch.  She didn't have a cookbook.  She didn't have measurements.  She just threw everything together.  So, I'm kinda getting to that point where I just try that and everything just seems to work.
L:  Well, my daughter is -- she cooks everything from scratch.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She bakes breads from scratch and -- which I could never get into.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  I can with my bread machine, but I can't like raise my bread.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got a bread machine for my daughter who's getting married and she says she doesn't buy regular bread anymore.  She just loves it.
R:  Uh-huh.  It is great.
L:  Yeah.  I'll have to try it some time.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I cannot make -- I can cook, like I said, I can cook anything.  I'm thirty two years old and you would think I was like my great grandma's age because I can cook anything.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Wow!
R:  And, I mean, I have people that work with my husband that pay him to pay me to make fudge --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- and so, I mean -- and, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- to be able to make fudge you're pretty good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's --
R:  But I can --
L:  -- that's a little tricky.
R:  -- I cannot make bread.  I cannot make homemade biscuits.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I can make it in my bread machine perfectly.
L:  Wow!
R:  So, I guess it's just the temperature in the east and I'm not good with that.  So ...
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I don't do well with yeast either.
R:  So, I am loving my bread machine.
