R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and my older daughter is, um, really in crafts and stuff.  So, I'm starting to get into crafts and sewing and, you know, all that kinda stuff and, um, I also like to read, um [LIPSMACK], and, uh -- oh, you know what I do like do?  I like to spend some time on the Internet.

R:  I have an eight month old.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Boy or girl?
R:  Girl.  Her name's Jordan.
L:  I have two girls, Annie and Lucy.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  Um, they are seventeen months apart.  So ...
R:  That's -- that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]  So, my kids are kind of my biggest hobby right now I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  Yep.  Definitely.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  They're -- they're more than enough time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I remember I used to read -- gosh, like ...
L:  A lot more than you do now I'm sure.
R:  I read like three books a week.
L:  That's like my husband.
R:  Now I'm lucky if I get one in every two months.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I try and read when I go to bed.
L:  Yeah.  But I'm sure you're so tired by then.  [LAUGH]
R:  Actually she's a really good baby.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yep.  I don't know how we lucked out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but we did.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, how did you find out about this study?
R:  Um, I don't know if -- the volition website.
L:  Okay.
R:  It's for mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um, I do that and I saw something on it and I thought at first it said Fisher Price.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I pulled it up and I'm like -- I'm like this doesn't look like Fisher Price.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm like ah.
L:  I found out through my sister in law who lives out in Philadelphia.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Somebody had sent it to her.
R:  Has she been doing this long?
L:  Yeah.  She's doing it too.  So, yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, so you're a mystery shopper too?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh, so is my sister in law.
R:  Really?
L:  I've -- I -- I tried to sign up to do it.  I just thought to myself when I -- I don't know what website I used.  I don't think it was that one.  But it was, um, so much paperwork.  I was just like I don't think I can do it right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I did it because I just, um, quit my job, you know, to --
L:  Same with me.  Yeah.
R:  -- stay home and it was something that, you know, I've always wanted to do it, but I didn't know how to get it into it --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and then I just happened to be talking to my brother about it one day and I was telling him that everything I was pulling up on the Internet came up with ya had to pay --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and he gave me this one site and from there I just started doing it.  I mean, it's nothing you get rich from.
L:  Right.  Obviously.
R:  But it's kinda fun I think.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  Ya get free stuff, plus you get paid ...
L:  You do?
R:  Well, not from everybody, but like if -- whatever company you're doing some of them will let you keep the product.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  It's kinda fun.
L:  So, is your daughter crawling or ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All over the place.
L:  Yeah.  Well, my second daughter, you know, she started walking at nine and a half months.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, it could be closer than you think.
R:  I think she's gonna start real soon --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause she -- she's kinda pushing that way.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm -- I'm kinda just nervous enough with her crawling all over.  My husband was just scolding me before because I'm like "Be careful.  Be careful".  He's like --
L:  I know.  It's hard though.
R:  -- she's a baby.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't wanna her to cry.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Oh, believe me, my kids have had more bumps and bruises ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know?  But, yeah, it's funny how I -- I felt like I had so many hobbies before I had kids and then all of a sudden my entire world revolves around my kids --
R:  Uh-huh.  Yep.
L:  -- you know, and they kind of are -- you know --
R:  Universe.
L:  -- my hobbies -- my hobbies revolve around what they like, you know?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  We -- my husband and I used to go to the movies like twice a week.
L:  Oh, me -- us too, yeah.
R:  And forget that.  Now it's stay at home.
L:  We haven't been -- we -- we go to the movies maybe like twice a year --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- now, you know?
R:  I don't even remember the last time now that they've been to a movie.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Every now and then we'll get out to go to dinner.
L:  Yeah.  Do you have babysitters or family nearby?
R:  Actually my parents just moved down here this week.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  That's great.
R:  Yeah.  So, thank- thankfully, you know, they'll be ...
L:  That'll be nice to --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to have them -- grandparents close by.
R:  Yes.  I don't know how you are with babysitters, but we're kinda nervous about, you know, anybody.
L:  I was nervous with my first.  I -- I mean, I'll be honest, that with my first she didn't stay with anybody except my Mom or my sister forever --
R:  God!
L:  -- um, and it -- it probably wasn't until my second daughter was seven months and my older daughter was two that we left them with anybody other than family.
R:  Right.
L:  [LIPSMACK] But we go -- at our church they have a big -- we live right near a big university and they have a big, um, college group at our church and so we found two college students from our church --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, 'cause I wasn't comfortable with like high school students.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um ...  Yeah.  So, we found two college students from our church who, um, baby sit sometimes for us.  So ...
R:  What's the going rate now?
L:  Well, I told them from the -- from the get go I said, you know, "I need ya to -- I need ya to be able to get here on your own and I can only pay you five dollars an hour".
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, now typically speaking, um, if they come in the evening I will have the kids either in bed or ready for bed.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, so they don't really have to do much.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, and if they come during the day I try to have them come when, you know, either the kids are napping or, you know, something like that.  So, you know?  Yeah.
R:  I wouldn't even know if I had to pay someone what the pay is.
L:  Well, I know.  Like there's a friend of mine who lives up the street she has two kids and she pays ten dollars an hour --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- which I think is just -- I mean, her babysitter is a preschool teacher.  But I just think that's a lotta money.  [LAUGH]
R:  I think when I used to baby sit I think I got seventy five cents an hour.
L:  Oh, my gosh!  I remember getting like about twenty five.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I mean, give me a break, you know?  There's some jobs -- you can't -- you can't even get some jobs to pay five bucks an hour, you know?
R:  Right.  Yeah.
L:  And the funny thing is -- is that like I say to my friend up the street, I'm like, you know, let's say you go out for five hours you've got fifty bucks in babysitting on top --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- of whatever you go out and do.
R:  Right.
L:  You know what I mean?
R:  That's true.
L:  So, how many times have you been called for this?
R:  This is my first one.
L:  Yeah.  Well, they've called me a couple of other times, but it was on my answering machine, like I didn't answer.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, this is the first time I've ever talked to anybody.
R:  I was in -- I actually just signed up last night.  I wasn't even --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- expecting it.  I put nine, ten and eleven at night --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I figured the baby will be in bed --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, and I don't have anything going on.  But my husband's off tonight so I'm cooking -- I was just cooking dinner, getting it ready --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and the phone rings.  So, I thought it was my Mom --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then this automated thing comes on and I didn't even hear what topic it said --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm like argh, well, I guess I could just hang up --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] when someone comes on if I don't know what to talk about.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know how ...
L:  Now, what were you making for dinner?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  What were you making for dinner?
R:  Chicken.
L:  Okay.  Do you like to cook?
R:  Yeah.  Actually I, uh, graduated with a culinary arts degree.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Your husband's lucky.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, and now, uh -- and ...
L:  I would say that's kind of one of my hobbies, like I love to cook and bake and stuff.
R:  I used to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But then because I was doing it for a living --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now it's just a passing -- I mean, I cook every night for dinner --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I bake sometimes.  But that used to be my hobby --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's different once you get paid for it.
L:  What time does your baby go to bed?
R:  Usually she's in bed by nine, but we were out late today.  So --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- she's still up.
L:  Okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  My kids go to bed at like between eight and eight thirty --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and they get up anywhere between like six thirty and seven thirty.
R:  Wow!
L:  So, yeah.
R:  We're lucky.  She -- she sleeps a good twelve hours.
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yes, it is.
L:  See, I -- I wonder, I'm -- I'm sure if I put them to bed later they'd get up later.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I just really -- I need the time in the evening, you know, especially since my two year old only takes one nap now --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know?  You have less time during the day to get things done.
R:   Right.
L:  So ...
R:  I know I look forward to her naptime.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  She usually ...
L:  You're lucky she's a good sleeper.
R:  You know, I don't how we lucked out, but I'm thankful that we did luck out.
L:  It's funny because my first was real difficult in terms of sleeping and napping and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and my second has been a breeze pretty much and I always say like if I had had my second first and then my second -- the first second --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it would've been a lot harder [LAUGH] --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, 'cause I would've been expecting her to be, you know, so easy.  But, yeah ...
R:  I know my friend she just had her second baby --
