R:  Hi.
L:  [MN]  Hi.  
R:  Hi, my name's Becky.
L:  My name's Barbara.  And, um, we're talking, I guess, about hobbies and how much time we spend doing them.
R:  Right.  Never -- never enough, right?  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, never enough time.  No.  So what -- what part of the country are you in?
R:  I'm calling from Washington State.  I'm about, uh, twenty miles south of Seattle.
L:  All right.  I'm in Vermont.  [MN]
R:  Oh, okay.  Opposite ends of the world.  [LAUGH] 
L:  North central, yeah.
R:  Kind of similar climates to a degree, but I think you're colder than we have.  Like gardening seasons probably a little different.  [LAUGH]  
L:  I -- yeah.  Our gardening's pretty short.  But [MN] you know we try to make the most of it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Same -- same way here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...  Are you a gardener?
R:  Yes I am.  
L:  Yeah?
R:  Yeah.  Both my flowers and my vegetables, which I got to get my husband out there and get that patch done up -- dug up pretty quick or it's gonna be too late to get things [LAUGH] going.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, he's doing my [MN] -- I've got to put in a [MN] -- a -- a new bed of strawberries this year.  Well, actually they were growing wild in the front and I had to move 'em out of the flower [LAUGH] beds. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we've just -- they're, you know, they're blooming so we- we'll see how they do in their new spot.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  The going from the -- the front yard to, kind of, the backyard so it's, kind of, one those deals you never know how it's gonna -- how they're gonna take to the move.  But that's kind -- we have the strawberries.  And then we have a big raspberry patch that we don't do anything with it but pick the berries.  Literally.  You know I -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- cut 'em -- cut 'em back in the fall and then [MN] they're on their own.  I don't water them or anything.  And we -- last year, I think, we [MN] -- it's only -- the patch is probably about twenty feet long and we got, like, five or six gallon out of it last year.  Just --
L:  Wow, that --
R:  I know, I -- I'm --
L:  -- sounds pretty good.
R:  Yeah, we give 'em away.  I have the -- you know, I still have them in the freezer.  In fact my husband's to the point of, "Gotta give those ones away that's left in the freezer 'cause we're gonna being picking new ones".  They're --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- blooming already, of course.  So [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  So that's -- you know, that's the only trouble with fruit.  Sometimes if it's successful it's almost too [LAUGH] successful.
L:  Yeah.  I know what you mean.  Yeah.
R:  Right.  And we've got -- we've been planting, uh, we've got [MN] I think -- yeah, four different small dwarf fruit trees that we put in the last couple of years so ...
L:  What kind of fruit trees?
R:  Let's see.  One of 'em is a, um, transparent apple.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then we've, uh, uh, one of 'em is, um, [LIPSMACK] plum and I'm trying to remember -- Santa [MN] -- I think it's called -- called Santa Rosa plum.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then one's an apricot and the last one is a -- I can't remember the -- the -- it's a peach tree but it's, uh, something that's supposed to be good in this climate.  It's -- can't remember the name of it.  Last year we got, like, fifteen peaches off of it.  Nothing else did anything.  This year all the -- I think right after everything bloomed we get -- we've been having hail storms and it just knocked everything off.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  The only thing I've seen I've got --there's one little baby plum that survived on the plum tree.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Shoot.
R:  The apple tree we just put in this spring, of course.  So we don't expect anything.  It's just a little baby.  But, uh, yeah, you know, you just -- you never know what the weather's going to do you.  We've been having a lot of hail storms this spring so ...
L:  Oh, gosh.  
R:  Which we almost never have.  So, you know, we just -- it's wiping out the fruit like [LAUGH] crazy.  
L:  Oh, I bet.  I bet.  Geez.  
R:  And do you live at -- you live in town or out in the country or ...?
L:  We're -- we're out in the country but it's kinda growing up with --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- houses and I've had a garden since the mid eighties, um, and then, uh, big -- big -- mostly vegetables.  And quit the last few years 'cause I was just kind of getting tired of all these -- it was just wide rows.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And, um, so this spring I had a friend help me design a different kind of garden with sort of a -- a pattern to it and [MN] different beds, raised beds that --
R:  Oh, the raised beds.  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I've used those.  Boy, that's kind of -- ours is kind of -- well, it's not really raised because we used the -- the, uh, like the timbers, you know, to mark it out but it's -- it's -- it's pretty well just -- 'cause it's part of the backyard so we had to demark it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- someway.  In fact at one time -- 'cause the river -- we -- the river's at the -- at the back of our property.  The Puyallup River.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- couple --
L:  That's [inaudible].
R:  -- of ye- -- several years ago it was more like it was sunk in.  W- we had a pretty high flood and it actually filled the garden in with [LAUGH] dirt so ...
L:  Oh, no.  
R:  Well, it's -- it's good.  It's volcanic soil so it's real good for growing [LAUGH] but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, uh ...
L:  But still ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know, yeah, it was a little more -- a little more water there than we really [LAUGH] needed.  So we've kind of had -- we've had some, kind of, [MN] volcanic soil because we're actually downstream from Mount Ranier[?].
L:  Oh, really?  
R:  Yeah. Uh-huh.
L:  My husband went climbing there.
R:  Pardon?
L:  My husband went ice climbing --
R:  Oh, did he?
L:  -- there at one time.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  I know --
R:  Yeah, it's, uh -- it's -- it's beautiful mountain.  You know, when you can see it.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.
R:  When it's raining you can't but ...  [LAUGH]  It's beautiful.  You know, yeah, we -- we don't -- my husband and I aren't really climbers.  We're -- we're both almost sixty but, uh, yeah we -- yeah, we go up there, you know, once or twice a year.  Go up in the snow maybe once and then -- especially if we have guests from out of town.  In the summertime we'll go up there.  You know, just kind a knock around.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Just kind a -- just up -- up on the glacier rather than -- than, like, up to the very top or something?
R:  Yeah, we really don't -- we don't go to the ice or anything just because it's -- it's -- some of the -- some of the trails are pretty bad.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, they've -- they've -- they have probably five or ten people die every [LAUGH] year up there.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So yeah, it's a d- it's a dangerous mountain if you get in the wrong parts of it.  But we go in the -- the tourist places, you [LAUGH] know.  
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, that sounds like fun.
R:  Yeah.  Now do --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- you have any indoor hobbies that you do in the -- in the wintertime or ...?
L:  Um, from time to time I do various kinds of crafts things.  [MN]  Um, you know, get going on a project.  [MN]  I like to do the memory book --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- stuff.  I just -- I -- I just haven't had time to do much of that lately.
R:  Yeah, that's one of the things I haven't, but I'm thinking about it, 'cause I need to start putting together, uh, one book, like, for my grown up son now.  You know, of the baby pictures and all that stuff of him.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Mm.  All that kind of stuff.  But it's -- it's just -- I'm -- I'm still working part time so I'll be --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- retiring in a little over three years.  I'll -- then I know I'm gonna have lots of time to do whatever [LAUGH] I want so ...
L:  Yeah.  So -- well, do you have, um, do you have any other -- do you have any indoor hobbies that you do now?
R:  Oh, yeah.  I, uh, I do plastic canvas.  I don't know if you're familiar with that.
L:  No, what's that?
R:  Plastic canvas is kind of like needlepoint but the -- the -- it -- it's what -- the grade is kind of like plastic.
L:  Kind of like bargello? 
R:  Pardon?
L:  Bargello?
R:  Uh, I don't -- well, there's -- you can do all kinds of patterns and make all kinds of --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- things with 'em.  Um, I don't know if you're online, you might just want, you know, just out of curiosity might look it up, plastic canvas.  For one thing is -- like say I'm on -- you know, my husband and I are almost sixty and I get -- it's a lot easier to see than if you were doing needlepoint.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So that type of stuff.  Because [MN] you get a -- grids are bigger.  And I, you know, I've -- I've done all kinds of [inaudible].  I've made a lot of, uh, like the tissue boxes.  And you -- you know, you can do all kinds of really neat designs with them.  And Christmas ornaments, and just all kinds of stuff.  
L:  Oh, yeah, I've s- I've seen those.  
R:  Yeah, you probably --
L:  It's kind a like cross stitch only bigger.
R:  It's kind of but it's a -- 
L:  And it's plastic.
R:  Right, it's a much bigger.  Yeah, and it's -- [MN] it goes fast because it's big too so you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- don't +get really stuck for a long time on a project. 
L:  Yeah, I've seen -- 
R:  And I --
L:  I've seen [MN] some of that.  
R:  Yeah.  For Mother's Day I made my [MN] -- my daughter in law who's three quarter American Indian and I made her three -- they call 'em tiles but they -- you could use 'em for hanging or for like a trivet or whatever.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  With American -- American Indian motifs on them.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  
R:  Yeah.  And I get a -- a lot -- a lot of the patterns I get off the net so +I'll, you know -- I mean, you can buy [MN] pattern books and they'll kill you on the [LAUGH] price.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [MN]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've -- I've -- 
R:  I've got a --
L:  I've noticed that.
R:  -- couple of notebooks full of 'em now that I've accumulated in the last couple of years so, um ...  You know when something comes up, "Oh, gee I wonder if there's something I can make plastic canvas?"  You know, it's just kind of fun doing something homemade for people --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because so many people don't do that kind of stuff anymore.
L:  Yeah.  That's kind of --
R:  And --
L:  -- the same with the memory book thing.
R:  Right.  
L:  Um ...
R:  And then I, um, do you do any sewing?  Any actual sewing or ...?
L:  Um, [MN] not much.  A little bit.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Here and there.  
R:  Yeah, it's --
L:  Um ...
R:  I've had a couple projects that I've had.  Like one of 'em, a denim jumper that I've got so far on it and it seems I can't, like, I --I can't get back to it.  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I bought a couple of pairs of pants 'cause I'm real short and I need to hem 'em.  Well, they're -- they're ready to do I just have to get to it.  [LAUGH]  
L:  I know what you mean.  I've got bags of mending to do.
R:  Oh, gosh.  
L:  [several inaudible words] some things I just, you know, stuff away and it's either letting -- you know, letting down a hem or +taking something up or just putting a button [LAUGH] on.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Sometimes it's just putting a button back on just takes the time to do it, I know exactly.
L:  Just [several inaudible words]..  And just sitting down to it, kind a thing.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  You haven't --
L:  So ...
R:  Do you, uh, I guess another hobby I have, kind of, is col- -- uh, is collections.  Do you collect anything?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I, um, I -- I, sort of, uh, collect candles somewhat.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And, um, and, uh, I collect books about King Arthur and, um, Ar- Arthudi- Arthurian fiction.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And -- and myths and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, that's kind of interesting.  Yeah, I, uh -- I collect all kinds of coca cola stuff, so ...
L:  Oh.  
R:  I'm a coca cola collector and [inaudible].  Not -- not necessarily the -- the antique stuff but, you know, just kind of start -- well, I actually started in eighty five.  I won an automobile which coca cola was the one that paid for it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.
R:  And that kind of got me, you know, "Okay, coca cola's been good to me".  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  It seemed soon everytime anybody went anywhere they brought me coca cola stuff so, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it started kind a innocently and [LAUGH] it's [LAUGH] ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  It's grown.  You know, [MN] in fact this -- when we redid our dining room I had
