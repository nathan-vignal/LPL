R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Yes, hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Jeanette.
L:  Is what?
R:  My name is Jeanette.
L:  Oh.  Well, my name is Mary.
R:  Hi, Mary.
L:  Hi.  [MN]
R:  Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about hobbies.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm gonna walk in the other room so I can hear you better.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, [MN] okay.  Yeah, well, I have several hobbies.  Uh, uh, genealogy's one.  And, uh, refunding and coupons is another.
R:  Oh, wow, that's mine too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What, did you sign up on, uh, [MN] Refund Makes Cents?
R:  I sure did.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Did you [LAUGH] really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did too.  A- and what did you say your name was?  I didn't get when I was in the --
R:  It --
L:  -- other room.
R:  It's Jeanette.
L:  Edna?
R:  Jeanette.
L:  Boy.  I -- I'm a little hard of hearing.  I just can't understand.
R:  I -- it's Jeanette.  J.E.A.N. --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- E.T.T.E.
L:  Oh, Annette?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, sure, okay.  Um, well, what kind of hobbies do you have?
R:  Uh, I do a little bit of scrapbooking.  Oh, gosh I haven't done it in quite a while though.  I never seem to have as much time as I'd like to do it.  It seems like once you get started it takes forever so ...
L:  Well, how do you do that anyway?  I've -- I've heard about that and I've thought about it, but I don't know anything about it.
R:  Um, it -- it's a little bit on the expensive side to get started if -- if you don't have anything.  It's just, um, you take the pictures, instead of just putting 'em in a regular photo album --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, you get special paper and markers and stuff from the scrapbook supply places.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And [MN] I don't -- it's kind of a decorative way to showcase your pictures.  Um, I've done a couple books but I don't really take that many pictures.  I mean, my nieces [LAUGH] and my nephews are all getting so much older now, and they're not around as much as they were when they were little so ...  But it's actually a lot of fun.  We get together, um, on Friday nights usually at, uh, one of the scrapbook stores and we do it for a couple a hours.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So it's a lot of fun.  It really is if you can get a group of people to go.  Um, and you get other ideas from everybody and ...  So our first couple books look pretty bad.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  So -- 
R:  But the more we did it the better we got and it's a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, I bet it is.  That sounds --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so -- real interesting.  And just getting together with friends, you know --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- is -- is fun.  
R:  A lot of my friends have kids so that -- [MN] you know, the husbands watch the kids and that's their night to get out.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And -- and -- and get away and, you know, once you have all your stuff and if you -- 'specially if you go to a store you get to use, you know, all -- all of their supplies and stuff, and it's kind of like a cheap night out once you get everything and get all your pictures together so ...
L:  [MN]  Oh, well, I don't take any -- many pictures anymore.  My grandkids are grown.
R:  [MN]
L:  And then -- they take a lot of pictures so I just let [LAUGH] them take the pictures now. 
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what I do.  I just, you know, every year I get the school pictures and -- [LAUGH] and that's about it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have five nieces and nephews and they are just -- they get so big so fast.
L:  I know it.  
R:  And I was [MN] --
L:  Do you [MN] -- um, have you ever tried, uh, genealogy.  
R:  No.  That just sounds so interesting though.
L:  Oh, it is.  Uh, I traced, uh, my mother's side and my father's side and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- and then on my husband's side, uh, his -- well I did, uh, as far as I could go.  They're from Denmark so I -- I can't --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- speak Danish.  But, um, uh, [MN] he -- my husband's [MN] sister, um, is -- is doing his side of the family and she's gone over to Denmark and -- and found, um, a lot of relations.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, and -- and we always thought, uh, [inaudible] be my husband's father and mother came over in Denmark in nineteen ten and that's -- and we thought that -- that was the only relation here, see, in his family.  But, uh, now we're finding out -- sh- she's finding out, uh, there's, um, relation in Spokane that sh- she visited and uh, up here in, near Seattle and, um, [COUGH] -- oh, several other places.  So, uh, it -- it really makes it interesting.
R:  Wow.
L:  I -- I've --
R:  Is it --
L:  -- gotten quite far back on my, uh, my mother's side.  They came from Canada and then they came from Germany.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, uh, so, uh, it -- it's really interesting.  It takes a lot of time.  
R:  Oh, I bet.  And do you use the internet for that or do you use ...?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, you can use [inaudible] too.  There's some wonderful sites on there.  Uh, the, um, Mormon library at +Salt Lake City is on there and -- and I guess the Mormons are real particular about doing genealogy.
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  And, uh, so they ha- -- in fact, if you happen to be a Mormon, or not, but, uh, it might be done for you, you see.  
R:  Wow.
L:  So, uh, that -- that'd really be simple.  
R:  And my grand- -- [MN] about the only thing that I know is that my, um, grandma's parents came from Italy and my grandpa's parents came from Italy, and that's about really all that we know.  
L:  Oh.
R:  But I -- I mean, both my -- my grandma and grandpa are both gone now so, but --
L:  [MN]
R:  [MN]  [several inaudible words] always remember in, like, fifth or sixth grade or something we had to do a little family tree in school but [LAUGH] that was as far as I ever got.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well --
R:  So ...
L:  -- once you get started it -- it gets to be addicting.
R:  Oh, I bet.
L:  [MN]  Sort of like [LAUGH] couponing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, yeah.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, uh, another thing I --I've done, I haven't done it lately much is, um, contesting.  And, uh, I've won, uh, not lately much.  Oh, I won some of that -- those things on the computer, you know
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, [MN] I started about, oh, at least twenty years ago and, um, we won a car and --
R:  Really?
L:  -- refrigerator and -- all kinds of stuff like that.  But now they -- they only have sweepstakes and so that's a lot more difficult.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's still [MN] fun to enter.  I still enter but I don't win much.  Just little biddy stuff, you know.
R:  I -- I do -- and I -- I find that I have a lot more luck.  I do like the radio station contests where you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- call in and answer a question.  I seem like I have way better luck with that --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- than sending off an entry form somewhere.  I just, um, a friend and I a couple of weeks ago went to one of those murder mystery dinners.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and I won that on the radio.  We had dinner and, um, they did the murder mystery and I was a suspect, and it was actually very cool.  And I won that off a radio station.
L:  Oh.  
R:  And --
L:  And -- and --
R:  -- it was a lot of fun.  When I heard they were giving away I thought I'm gonna win me one of [LAUGH] those.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  All right.
R:  So -- and I --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- did and -- and my friend was so excited.  She could hardly wait.  And we really did.  We had a good time.  And I don't win very often from radio stations.  It seems like I do better with the local ones.  I live near Chicago.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I do a lot better -- better with our local radio stations.  I can never get through to the big stations in Chicago.  
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  So ...
L:  I suppose everyone is doing it.  Um, I live, uh, in Vancouver, Washington.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you know where that is?
R:  Yeah, I do.
L:  Oh, yeah.  And so, uh, [MN] we try to cross the river from Portland and -- and -- but they don't seem to be having as many contests over the radio.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, they're eas- easier to win than these national contests.
R:  They are.  Because you're -- I don't think you're competing against as many people.  I mean, I don't -- I win little things like gift certificates for restaurants and movie tickets and -- and stuff like that.  But I -- I seem to have a lot better luck with that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than, you know, than I do with the -- the natio- -- I mean, I always send in my little entry forms but I never win [LAUGH] anything.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  It seems like every [MN] year right around the same time, I think it's G.E. puts a -- a -- a sweepstake in the paper to win a freezer and every year I send in that stupid thing thinking this year I'm gonna win a freezer and I --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- never [LAUGH] win.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  I always get so disappointed.
L:  Well, uh, out here, um, is a store called Fred Meyer.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they have quite a few, uh, things, like a freezer.  And they have 'em quite often too.  Uh, I haven't -- I haven't -- years ago I won a freezer but, uh, not from Fred Meyer but, um, I'd say about two years ago I won a treadmill from there.
R:  Wow.
L:  And, um, I, um, I used it, you know.  For the first few weeks I was pretty enthusiastic but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] I haven't done much lately.  Although, um, my husband said may as well get rid of it.  But, uh, I plan on using it some day.
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]  And you won it.  It's yours.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Right.  But --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- we have a -- don't have that much room in that spare bedroom now with a computer and -- and hi- his exercise equipment and -- and [MN] -- and my, uh, treadmill, but we get in there.  Well, do you have any other hobbies?
R:  Um, uh, my friend and I go to the gym and -- and do weight training twice a week.  I'm not sure if that's really a hobby but it seems like that -- that takes up a lot of time to go to the gym.  I don't really do it to lose weight.  I don't 'cause I know I'm never [LAUGH] gonna lose weight.  We do it more for -- to get out and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and stuff.  We, uh, it's a pick -- kickboxing, +about six months we quit.  Um, we really enjoyed it but we weren't getting too much out of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, we seem like we do better with the treadmills and -- and, um, [MN] the -- the weight machines and stuff than we ever did with the kickboxing so ...  It's a lot of fun.  We get out and we usually have a -- have a da-
