R:  Hi, I'm Selina.
L:  Hi.  I'm Lesley.  [MN]
R:  Where are you from?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm from South Florida.  And you?
R:  I'm from Texas.
L:  Uh-huh.  Have you -- is this your first time doing this?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  I did it last week about time travel.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  So ...  The person said, "Well, I hope we're not getting charged for these calls."  
R:  No, I don't think --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- we are.  
L:  It's a research thing, I --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- I understand.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So it sounds like a good topic.
R:  Yeah.  It does.  I just got my -- my hobby thing in the mail today.  I do refunding and couponing and all that kind of stuff.
L:  Oh.  You work for a company?
R:  No, I just do it, um, as a hobby.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  You get a lot of free stuff and, you know, stuff like that.  
L:  Oh.
R:  That's how I heard about this thing.  Was, um, on the internet.
L:  Mhm.
R:  On this website that I look at about coupons, and we give each other tips on free stuff and cheap stuff that's around and stuff like that.  
L:  Oh, if you remember could you send me.  My -- my screen name is labird.  L.A.B.I.R.D.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's real easy.  I'm at aol.
R:  Okay.
L:  Okay.  Yeah, that would be interesting.  So [MN] you work and then you do that as well?
R:  Yeah, I just do it as a hobby, like, um, [LIPSMACK] one of my good deals was Office Depot was having this thing where you went in and bought, um, [LIPSMACK] like, Sharp- -- they had certain products that counted for this -- you could get like a twenty dollar, um, gift card --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you purchased twenty dollars in, like, Sharpy markers or Expo, those dry erase markers and the dry erase, um ...
L:  [MN]  That would've been great --
R:  Erasers --
L:  -- for me.
R:  -- and permanent markers.  Just -- all this kind of stuff.  So I went and I tried to get as close to twenty dollars as I could.
L:  Mhm.  I wish I'd known.
R:  And then -- yeah, and then they give you the gift card.  But then the good thing was it didn't say one per person, one per household, nothing like that.  So I just kept on going back and paying with the gift card.
L:  'Cause I'm a teacher.  I know a lot of --
R:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- people could've benefitted from that.  Geez.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a -- it was about a month ago.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, yeah.  And I had a -- I didn't even notice it in the paper.  
L:  Mm.
R:  'Cause it was, you know, in -- wherever there was an Office Depot they were running the same ad.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And when I looked on the internet at that website that I look at everybody was talking about all these free markers and all of this stuff, so ...
L:  Wow.  It's funny you say that because my favorite hobby is also computer related.  I'm on ebay all the time.
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  In fact, um, yeah, I --I have maybe like four hundred cameos.  I've started collecting cameos.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know, for necklaces and earrings and things.  And then I bought a drill because I thought I could try to carve some myself, but I carved into the dining room table --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- accidentally.  And I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- said I'm not doing this anymore.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So I collect a lot of things.  I should probably --
R:  What do you collect?
L:  I should probably sell things.  I collect, um, well, one time I was collecting coca cola bottles.
R:  Oh, I collect coke stuff, too.  Not that much anymore, but I used to.
L:  Me too.  I have all the polar bears that do the little sports --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- poses.  I don't know if you've seen those.  And I have, like, three vending machine banks.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And people buy me things like potholders and aprons and things that are coca cola all the time, still.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I had to tell --
L:  What do you collect?
R:  I had to tell my mom to stop buying it.  Um, now I collect -- I colle- -- I have so much stuff it's just sad.  I have my coca cola stuff and the one thing that I like from there, uh, my husband was in the military and one of his friends had a coke bottle from Egypt --
L:  Oh, neat.
R:  -- that he -- he didn't want so he gave that to me.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I've got some coke stuff and I collect little Simpsons figures.  You know, the cartoon show that's on Fox.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I collect those little figures but I had to stop because there's too many of 'em.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I've never really looked at those.  I bet they're pretty neat.  [MN]
R:  Yeah, they're kind of cute.  Um ...
L:  One of my students gave me one of the Simpson watches.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When those came out they were ridiculous.  I have seniors and they all brought the watches and they were going off, "Are we there yet?  Are we there yet?"
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  "Mm.  Burger".  All during class.  It was --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- terrible.  
R:  Yeah.  My husband's actually going to school right now to be a teacher.  
L:  Oh, great.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Well ...
R:  So he got all those free markers and [LAUGH] stuff.  
L:  That's perfect because --
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  -- you can never get enough supplies.
R:  Yeah, I started a box for him.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  Tea- --
L:  What's he gonna teach?  
R:  He wants to teach fourth or fifth grade.
L:  Oh, boy.
R:  Yeah.  That's what he wants to teach so we'll see what happens but ...
L:  Well, I give him a lot of credit.
R:  [LAUGH]  Do you --
L:  Tell him not --
R:  -- have a, um, Hammett's teaching store in your area?
L:  No, we have an ABC teaching store.
R:  Oh, okay.  No, I was going to tell you.  One of my other good [LAUGH] skills -- I'm so terrible.  Um, they have all their bulletin board kits and stuff that --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- are regular, like, I think they're run eleven ninety nine.  Something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're all a dollar ninety nine and ninety nine cents.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm lucky because I'm at a performing arts school where we have --
R:  Oh, are you?
L:  -- visual arts and the kids do -- like I assign book reports and they do magnificent paintings and things.
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  So they pretty much decorate the boards, but I could always use like borders and things.
R:  Yeah, they had all that stuff for a dollar.
L:  You collect --
R:  That's good though.
L:  -- coca cola.  That's so funny.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And let's see.  I collect bird figurines.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I had a bunch of those.  And I collected all the Disney videos which was stupid because I don't really watch them.  The Disney cartoons.
R:  I know.  I collected a lot of 'em too and I don't -- yeah, I don't even have kids yet.  I don't [LAUGH] watch 'em either.  They're just there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I don't have kids and now is really the time to sell them because everything's DVD.
R:  Yeah.  I had bought a lot of 'em when I had first got married.  I was, like, "Oh, you know, for later when we have kids and all this stuff".  And now they're all out on DVD.  I was, like, great.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Oh, geez.
R:  We'll have to sell them all.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And let's see.  We were supposed to answer the question, should everybody have a hobby?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Um.  I think everybody kind a ha- -- well, not a hobby but they probably have something they -- they like to do.  For some people watching TV is their hobby so ...
L:  And some people like sports as a hobby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I guess they're not really good players but they like to go out on the court or out on the field.
R:  Yeah.  And shopping's a hobby.  Everybody likes ... [LAUGH]
L:  It's a compulsion.
R:  Everybody likes to spend money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So, I guess, did we answer all the questions pretty much?
R:  I think so.
L:  I think there was a third question.  What are your hobbies?  Well, I know that for me hobbies are a relaxation.  That's important.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And -- oh, how much time do we spend on them?
R:  Oh, gosh.  Mine varies actually.  [NOISE]  Yeah, mine varies a lot, so ...
L:  Was that a click on your end?
R:  I don't know.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  [NOISE]  I heard a [inaudible].
L:  I know when I go online I take forever.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm on there --
L:  It's hard to get off.
R:  -- all the time and you can't -- yeah, time just flies by so fast you can't even tell how long you've been on there.
L:  And then it's the end of the night and I haven't done my school paper grading.
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh, I have another collection, the co-boys[?].  You know Hummel figurines?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- my ex and I bought those.  I have all but one.  I have like fifty figurines.
R:  Oh, wow, that's a lot.  
L:  Maybe more than that.  At first I said I was just gonna get the one that's a writer.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then -- they look like little dwarves with different colored hats.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know which one I'm talking about?
R:  Yeah, I think so.
L:  And, um, then I said, "Well, I'll just get seven".  And then they ran a two for one sale, and then they said they were retiring pieces so I had to get those.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, beanies.  I have beanie babies too.  
R:  Oh, my mother bought me some of those for the grandchild she wants, so they're all packed away in boxes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How many do you have?
R:  Oh, not very many.  Probably like twenty or thirty.  They're just ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  They're just up there.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I should have a kid with all that I have.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I collected Native American art for a while.  And now that's, like, in my bathroom and in my office.  Now I'm -- I'm into African art so I've collected, like, instruments?
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um -- I'd probably have a nice home instead of an apartment if I didn't have hobbies like that.
R:  I know.  We've -- yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's why if you're doing something that's saves money and brings other things in, I would be interested in that.  
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's really -- I mean, you'd be surprised at the some of the stuff.  Like Amazon a lot of times have their Friday sale and stuff like that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And these people are getting stuff for -- for nothing.  I bought Christmas gifts and birthday gifts for about -- I'd say for a good two years for my nieces and nephews.  And spent maybe a hundred dollars.
L:  Oh, now, see I'd be interested in that too.
R:  Yeah, 'cause they had, um, free shipping and then there's no tax.  And the stuff was, like, eighty percent off.
L:  And this site will tell me about that too?
R:  Yeah.  The only thing is you have to join the site.  It's -- it -- you get a magazine and stuff.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, it's called Refunding Makes Cents.  Um, you get a magazine and they have like a message board on there and people post about good deals.  Like I was just reading right now this lady found a, um, a bouncy seat for a baby at Target, seventy five percent off.  So it was six dollars and twenty four cents.
L:  Wow.
R:  And my sister in law's gonna have a baby in a couple of months so that would be perfect.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, seventy five percent off.  So ...  But they tell you about, like, coupons and if they have, like, triple coupons.  Actually, you know what, in Florida last week Eckardt[?], I think, or one of those
