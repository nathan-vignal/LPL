L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  How are you?
L:  I'm good.  My name is Tina.
R:  Hello, Tina.  I'm Diane.  I haven't done this before.
L:  Neither have I.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh!
L:  -- we'll do it for the first time together.
R:  Okay.  Uh ...
L:  And so I guess our topic is gonna be hobbies tonight?
R:  Sure.  Um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- yeah, I was hoping I would get someone the first time that had actually done it before.  But we can -- we can muddle through it.
L:  Yeah.  It can't be that hard.
R:  All right.  Well, I -- I guess this is one of my hobbies now.
L:  [LAUGH] What other hobbies do you enjoy doing?
R:  Um, I like sewing and home decorating, that sort of thing.
L:  Oh.
R:  And you?
L:  I enjoy home decorating, um [LIPSMACK], basically d- dining, traveling, shopping, reading, and I have two small boys.  So, they're kind of a hobby too.
R:  They're -- they're a fulltime hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Slightly.
R:  Yeah.  So, where are you?  Are you -- are you in New York?
L:  No.  Actually I am in Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Near Miami, Florida.
R:  We're -- we're the other Florida.
L:  And where's that?
R:  No.  I'm in New York and I call that --
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  -- the other Florida.
L:  Oh.  How's the weather there?
R:  Um, it's actually quite nice at the moment.  So, um, which is quite good because we're having our garage done, our basement.
L:  Oh, wow!  It's very hot here.
R:  That's nice.  I like hot.
L:  [LAUGH] Florida gets a little too hot though.  It makes hobbies kinda hard to be done, especially if you like doing them outside.
R:  What -- what do you do outside?
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], well my kids love to go roller blading and so I do roller blading with them, biking.  Um, they wanna start up a new hobby of going camping, which I'm not too sure if I like or not.
R:  [NOISE]  [MN] You don't know until you try it.
L:  I went camping once when I was about I'd say fifteen and had a very bad experience.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I'm kinda -- kinda hesitant on that.
R:  Oh, okay.  No.  Well, the -- the only hobbies I have that are outside really, um, are gardening.
L:  Oh, you like gardening?
R:  Mm.
L:  My mother adores gardening.  She has bushes and plants and trees and beautiful flowers and everything outside of her place.
R:  Yeah.  No, well, I -- I live on a lake.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, there is not too much sort of gardening to be done there.  But on the patio and the little deck area and that sort of thing I'm thinking of putting some window boxes out this year.  But it'll have to go to the back of the list because [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I've -- as I say, once the downstairs is done I've gotta paint it and trim it and make, um, cushions, you know, for some seats and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's just as well I enjoy doing that sorta thing really.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  And I like to cook.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I like cooking.  That's a hobby.
L:  Oh, I adore cooking.
R:  Baking as well or just cooking?
L:  Um, mostly cooking.  I cook mostly -- well, I guess I do baking also, but mostly I cook Italian food --
R:  Right.
L:  -- um, 'cause I'm Italian.  So, of course, um, I -- I just love making Italian food and my husband loves it.  So, I spend a lotta time in the kitchen making manacoti and lasagna, and it's a lotta work, but it's worth it.
R:  And, uh, do you exercise at all?
L:  Sometimes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  When, uh, time -- I normally like to go walking and stuff with the kids and I take them to the pool quite often.  So, I'll get in there and do a few laps.  But, I mean, between the kids and school and everything else in my life it's kinda hard to put an exercise program and all.  So ...
R:  Yep.  Do you, um -- speaking of, um, hobbies and this sort of thing, do you -- do you do mystery shopping as well?
L:  Yes, I do.
R:  Okay.  So, that's how you found this?
L:  Um, yeah, exactly.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It was on one of the forums that I had seen and I thought it was interesting 'cause I like talking on the phone and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I figured, you know, it can't hurt to talk to someone new and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- discuss things for ten minutes and it helps them out and it's interesting, you get to meet new people.
R:  Oh, definitely.  Um, it's -- it's -- it's a bit like when you're on an airplane and you're traveling [LIPSMACK] and, um, you say a lot more to people sitting next to you on the plane than you would if they're in the supermarket.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  You know?
L:  That's very true.
R:  Um, I've -- I've done quite a bit of traveling.  That's -- that's a hobby too, but it's also business.  So, you know, a bit of both and, um, the -- the number of times I cannot tell you when have said to me -- and they've never met you before -- and they say to you, "Would you mind just looking after my bag for me while I go to the bathroom?" --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and you -- you say of course and, you know, you know you're all right and -- and, you know, I -- I said to my Mom once when I was traveling with her, "Why do people do that because [LAUGH] for all they know you could be the biggest, um, con merchant?" you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, admittedly you're on the passenger side of a -- a thing by this stage.  But I just -- you know, you wouldn't dream of saying that to a complete stranger in a car park or something.
L:  I've actually -- I've had people do that to me before too and I -- I agree to do it --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and I sit there and think about like oh, no, what if I have to go and they're not back?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And then I'll feel responsible if the bag is missing.  But it's just -- see, I guess once you open up to someone and you have that then you're gonna trust them.  So [LIPSMACK], I guess they feel that they can trust us because they've talked to us and that will do it and hopefully we won't rip them off.
R:  I don't think I'd do it now though just in case there was something in it that shouldn't be.  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  [LAUGH]  Now you gotta have to be careful.  Either that or carry your own little x-ray machine.
R:  It's like ...
L:  So, what other types of hobbies do you like to do?
R:  Well, I'd like to say I -- I like to read, which I do, but I just don't have time, like you, at the moment, there's just so many other things going on.
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, I'm finding that -- that the mystery shopping was a hobby that I started out thinking oh, I'll just do the odd job here and there, um, and that turned into some of these sort of things and then a bit of demonstrating work and some merchandising work and I ...
L:  Wow!  How is that?
R:  The merchandising or the demoing?
L:  Both of those.
R:  The merchandising is -- is better in some ways because it's more regular.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, 'cause I find with all of these things it takes the enjoyment out of it when you've got all the paperwork that goes with it, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you've got your online forms and then you've got --
L:  Yeah.  There's definitely a lotta paperwork with it.
R:  -- your paperwork and -- and, uh, so there's -- there's all of that.  There's still the paperwork with the merchandising, but at least because you're doing it regularly, but you're also given a timeframe.  So [LIPSMACK], you can, um -- like the one I -- I've literally just been back five minutes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I could've done it any day this week and then next month I can do it any day within that week frame.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, you know, if I feel that oh, I've got too much on or, um -- I mean, I love stripping down old furniture and redoing it and that sort of thing as well which, you know, is a great -- so this works really well around it because if I just think [MN], nah, I'm in the middle of this, argh, I'll do it tomorrow --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- as -- as long I don't leave it 'til the last day.  Um, there's one job I do once a week, but I normally do it on a Wednesday, but if I do it on the Tuesday or the Thursday I don't worry.  It's quite okay.
L:  I had started my mystery shopping pretty much as a hobby also --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- um, and then I just kinda figured out that it played into my schedule a lot better than a job would --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- 'cause I go to school fulltime.  I major in psychology.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know, I'm raising my two boys and I was like well, what better way is it?  I can do something that I love to do and get paid doing it --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and the more assignments they were giving me the more I was like wow, you know, this could really turn into something of a profit and, you know, it's a great hobby, it's a great way to spend your time, and so pretty much that's all I've been doing is the mystery shopping with the school and everything and it's -- it's turned out pretty well.  It gives me time to be able to do, you know, other things that I enjoy doing.  I can actually cook my full meals now and, you know, it's -- it's really nice.  It was a change.  I didn't think there were legitimate companies out there that offered this and I was very, very surprised when I found everything.
R:  You didn't initially get sort of conned with one of those, um, pay X. amount for a list, did you?
L:  Yes, I did.  [LAUGH]
R:  I didn't.
L:  I -- nineteen ninety five and, um, I got the list and it had about a hundred and fifty names on it of different companies and by going through some of the companies I had found different forums, like Cathy's Corner Two and things of that nature, and then I started getting even more companies by going through them and I was reading all on the forms on don't be dumb and pay for this list --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I'm thinking like uh-oh, I already did that.
R:  Oh, okay.  But, I mean, like that's what happens when you take something up and it is a hobby.  I mean, you've -- you've gotta learn, it doesn't matter what it is -- you've -- you've gotta learn the hard way some time and in some ways at least it wasn't too expensive.
L:  It really wasn't.  I mean, within the first day of my assignments I had three assignments.  So, I more than made up for what I put for it.
R:  Mm.
L:  But I figured as -- as long as I was compensated for what I put out then I was fine and --
