R:  Hello.
L:  Yes.  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name is Deborah.
R:  My name's Chris.
L:  Hi, Chris.
R:  How are you tonight?
L:  Um, I'm all right.  Tired but, you know.
R:  Same here.  Lot of work --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- huh?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Always too much to do.  Just finished dinner.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I'm getting ready to eat dinner.  Are you in, uh -- where are you at?
L:  I'm in, uh, [MN] Sherman Oaks part of Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I'm in San Diego.
L:  Oh, okay.  I -- I -- this is the first time I've done this so I don't even know.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  This is the first --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- call I've done.
R:  This is my, uh, third one.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So ...
L:  What do they limit you to three calls?
R:  Uh, yeah, supposedly.  That's what I've -- I've heard so ...  Just three calls, and I guess that's it.  So I -- I don't understand that but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Guess that's how they do it.  Uh, but, uh -- so what do you do for your hobbies?
L:  [SIGH]  Don't have much time for [LAUGH] hobbies.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Right.  
L:  Um, my dogs are -- are a big part of my hobbies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have --
R:  What kind of dogs do you +have?
L:  I have two dogs.  Uh, well, we used to have an American Eskimo but she died three weeks short of fifteen years.
R:  [MN]
L:  And now I have two Cavalier King Charles mixes.  So they're not --
R:  Oh, those are -- oh --
L:  They're -- yeah.  They're not pedigrees.  We rescued them.  We figured since we're not going to breed no sense spending a lot of money on a dog.
R:  Right.  Right.  Well, I have --
L:  And I also have a cat.
R:  You have a lot of room?  You have a big yard and what not?
L:  Yes.  Very big yard.
R:  Oh, well that's nice.  
L:  Yeah, and we have a decent size house.  It's about twenty eight hundred square feet.
R:  Oh, good.  'Cause those dogs need a lot of room to roam.
L:  Yeah, we'll they're not -- they're not big.  They're small dogs.
R:  They're not?  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah, they're small. 
R:  Oh, all right.  They sounded big.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, no.  They're not big at all.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's good.  They get along with the cat.
L:  Um, yeah, when I first got the cat it -- when she was -- she was a kitten, she was six weeks old, she got along with our -- the -- 'cause we only had one dog at the time so she actually grew up with that.  But then when we brought another dog in it took her about six months.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  And now they -- they play together.  It is so cute you can almost pee in your pants.
R:  Oh [LAUGH] really?
L:  Yeah, you -- you laugh your head off.
R:  Oh, my.
L:  And she hides --
R:  So who chases who?  The dog or the cat?  Who's -- who's more feisty?
L:  Um, well, my older dog, who's about eight now, doesn't play quite as much.  The younger one, um, is under three, and the cat's under three, so they play more together.
R:  Oh, I see.  
L:  And she'll hide behind a door and pounce out, you know.
R:  Right.
L:  Try to get him, but her front claws have been, um, declawed.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Otherwise both dogs would be blind.
R:  Oh, what do you think about that, uh, law in, uh, in West -- West Hollywood about declawing?  They're going to make it a law --
L:  Oh, I think --
R:  -- that you can't have your cat declawed.
L:  I think it's crazy 'cause if you're going to have a -- an indoor cat.  [MN]  We don't let her out.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  She's an indoor cat and if you're going to have indoor cat if you don't declaw 'em your furniture is gonzo.  Gone. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  As it is, she's ripped some of our furniture with her teeth.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So, um ...
R:  Yeah.  We have two cats ourselves.  And, uh, we have, uh, we got one -- we had one.  We adopted one from our friend of ours that moved to New York and, uh, for some reason or another, she wasn't even a year old, she started, um, hacking one day and we thought it was a hairball and next thing we know, three days later she died.
L:  [MN]
R:  It was the oddest thing and -- and, uh, they couldn't figure it out.  They could have done more tests but if they would have done, it would cost us like five thousand dollars and so we're like --
L:  I know.
R:  You know --
L:  That's [MN] --
R:  -- how much do you spend on a cat [LAUGH] for --
L:  I know.  It's -- it's --
R:  You get out of hand and you know it was such a loving cat too.  It's like -- it was so hard to put down so we decided to get another one and, um, this new one just, uh, it's a male cat.  The first one was a -- a female and we got a -- a male cat and we heard that they -- they do well together, instead of two females. 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, uh, we got it.  It was -- the -- the female cat that we had kind of, uh, didn't like it too well.  [LAUGH]  Didn't take it too kindly but now they get along great and they chase each other and it's -- it's -- it -- they're having a great time.
L:  Yeah, it takes some time to get used to each other that's for sure.
R:  Yeah, especially, yeah, one that's, uh, been here a while and wants to rule the roost.
L:  Yes.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  The new ones always take a little bit longer.  But they, uh, it's fun to really watch them play.  It's -- it's -- it's really cute.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Like --
L:  They wrestle and, you know, do all kinds of things so ...
R:  Uh, I think it's great to have an animal or something like that.  'Cause I think it -- it helps you out with, you know, uh, mentally, and, you know, it makes your day go by.  You got something to come home to and, you know.  People should --
L:  Oh, yeah I [MN] --
R:  -- have pets that are lonely, or whatever, 'cause I think it --
L:  Yeah, I couldn't live -- I've had a dog even when I was a kid.  I think the first dog I had, my dad brought home, I must've been about nine or ten.
R:  Uh-huh.  Wow.
L:  And, uh, when my husband and I bought a house we got a dog.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And so we're on our third dog now.
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, the first one, as I said, died so the second one is still with us and then our new third one is with us.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And it's nice too 'cause, um, [LIPSMACK] when my son comes home they get so excited.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I'm sure.
L:  Yeah, 'cause they don't see them -- they don't see him all the time so they go nuts.
R:  Yeah, I would love to have a dog but I live in a condo and -- and sometimes I'm not always around and so that's kind of a hassle.
L:  Yeah.  That is hard.
R:  Always finding someone to take care of it.
L:  Yeah, no that's hard.
R:  But you have a yard.  
L:  And even --
R:  [inaudible], it's -- it's so much easier.
L:  Yes.  Cats are self sufficient.  You can leave them for days alone.
R:  Yeah, exactly that's why, uh, that's why we have 'em.  And [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, and when we go away we have to get a housesit- -- you know, a pet sitter.
R:  +Uh-huh.  Do they do pretty well?
L:  Yes.  Much better than putting them in the kennel.  It's cheaper and they're in their own home so they don't feel displaced, or not stuck in some cage.
R:  Right.
L:  So it's --
R:  I agree.
L:  -- the only way that I would do it.
R:  I agree.  How did you find it?  In the paper or something?
L:  The, uh, pet sitter?
R:  +Pet sitter.  Yeah.
L:  Actually recommendations from friends.  
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  That's better than the paper.
R:  Right.
L:  I just asked friends that had dogs, and that's how we found the one that we use now.
R:  All right.
L:  It's -- it's the best way.  But with a cat you don't have to worry.
R:  No, you don't.  We -- we can leave for the weekend and make sure the bowl's filled --
L:  Right.
R:  -- really high and they'll -- they're fine.
L:  Yeah, they won't overeat like a dog.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, that's for sure.  [LAUGH]  But they are kind of piggies, though.  [LAUGH]  They come --
L:  My --
R:  -- home and they -- they -- they whine and cry like they've been starving for days.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Mine's -- no, mine's pretty good.  It eats its kibble and doesn't complain.
R:  You leave a full bowl out or do you do it, uh, you know, a little bit at a time.
L:  I fill the bowl up at nighttime.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, it's usually about empty by the time I'm ready to fill it up again at night.  'Cause I want to be sure she's quiet at night and doesn't cry for food and wake us up.
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  So, um ...
R:  That's a good idea.  Yeah, I give [MN] --
L:  That's all I give her, is one -- one bowl a day.  
R:  Yeah, that's exactly right.
L:  So that works out good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have any other hobbies?
R:  Well, I, uh, actually I work out five days a week so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  I head to the gym, so ...
L:  Yeah, I do too.  
R:  I'm into -- I'm into bodybuilding.  I'm not into it professionally but, uh, I like doing it for, uh, my health and, uh, um, just physical appearance and what not, so ...  It makes me --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- feel good about myself and, uh, you know, it -- it -- it gives me something to do on, you know, after work and release all that aggression from work and what not, so it's kind of -- its' kind of been a habit of --of mine for years.  So I just kind of do it and -- and I love it and -- the thing is I can't stop now.  Because once I stop everything falls apart.  [LAUGH]
L:  True.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I do it -- I go three times a week.  I hate it but I do it for my health and also ...
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  [MN]  You know, to look good so, um, I don't enjoy it but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I go.  And my twenty three year old son is always on my back.  He's really into body building and ...
R:  Oh, good.
L:  He -- he really, uh, he looks good.  He's in great shape, you know. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah, I'm trying to do it [MN] -- get my mom in -- but she lives in Illinois and, uh, you know, she says she goes but I don't think she does.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's hard if I'm not there to push her.
L:  That's true.
R:  You know, if I was there to say, "Let's go" then it'd be a lot easier, but it's tougher that way.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- one thing I like is they got that, uh, gym, Curves, for women.  Have you heard of that?
L:  What's it called?
R:  Curves.  It's a gym just for women.
L:  What's the --
R:  What they do is they do kind of like a, um, [MN] you -- you -- well, you do a machine and -- it's all timed.  And you --
L:  Oh, yeah, I heard -- I just read about it recently, I think, in the paper.  It's only -- it's only a thirty minute workout or something?
R:  Exactly.  And it's only for women and it's, you know, the -- all the windows are blacked out so, you know, you -- you know, people can't look in and it's very private and it's -- it's great for people that just want to get their blood, you know, blood pumping and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- get their energy up and it's all timed so, you know, there's not really -- you don't have to think about it, and you just do it.  And it's great for the older women that -- that, you know, just want to kind of do something and don't really want to get a trainer, [inaudible] not, but just go to a gym.  I think -- I think it's a great idea.
L:  Yeah, I don't know if there's any around me but I just read an article in the paper about it, and I don't even know what they cost to join.  
R:  Yeah, I don't know either.  But, it's -- it sounds like a great idea.
L:  But I joined my gym so many years ago it was, like, three fifty or something, but I got an -- a hundred dollar lifetime renewal.
R:  Oh, wow.
