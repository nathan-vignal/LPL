L:  [MN]
R:  I live in Wisconsin.
L:  Wisconsin?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, goodness. 
R:  Yeah, it's kind a cold up here compared to --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- where you live.  
L:  Yeah.  Don't have a ...  Yeah.  I got my Chit Chat, my, uh, R.M.C. today.  
R:  Oh, I did -- I did -- I did too.  Yep.  I was just starting to read it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]  Do you have any other hobbies?
L:  Yes, I love to garden.  Gardening is my big hobby other than, uh, uh, +coupon and stuff.  Other couponing and -- and re- rebating.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, I have a square foot garden, a four square foot gardens and flower beds and that type of thing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  I do -- I do, uh, mostly not regular gardening although I buy a couple tomato plants.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, but I do plant a lot of flowers around the house.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Matter of fact, I was just outside now.  I was gonna start planting some bulbs.  Some lily bulbs.  But our growing season up here is so short.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, it's not -- not like Florida.  Not where you can have stuff growing so -- so often.
L:  Yeah.  It gets so hot down here in the summer.  You have some things that are kind of hard to -- to grow but, uh, --
R:  Imagine you have to wa- --
L:  -- you have to kind of watch the things that are, you know, pick out things that are tolerant to the -- the heat --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and drought.  Uh --
R:  Yeah.  I bet you have to water the stuff a lot too.
L:  Yeah, I have to water just about every day late- -- you know, if it gets hotter.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, even then things tend to wilt in the afternoon.
R:  Oh, I bet.  Is that, uh, down near the tip of Florida?  Panama City?
L:  Near what?
R:  Near the tip of Florida?
L:  Tip?  Uh-huh.  No, we're -- well, th- -- we're up at the top part.  The panhandle.  
R:  Oh, near the top.  
L:  Close to Alabama.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've been to Orlando.
L:  Yeah.
R:  In, uh, in that area, Disney World.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, uh, yeah, I like --
R:  Oh, I --I think I remember seeing that on one of the signs.  Panama City.
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  So ...
L:  Uh, my other hobby, I guess, you [several inaudible words] you can call it a hobby or not, but the other thing I spend a lot of time doing is with my grandchildren.  
R:  Oh.
L:  Do you have any grandchildren?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Quite a few but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- none of them live really too close to me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But I send them little gifts and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- throughout the year and ...
L:  All three of mine live within twenty miles of where I live so ...
R:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  
L:  Well, you know, I was talking to my husband earlier today.  I said, "Well, you know, we're -- we're fortunate to have our grandchildren so close" and [LAUGH] sometimes, you know, if he gets a little [COUGH] you know they -- they come by a lot and call and spend the night and that kind of thing.  He says, "I'm not so sure".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  I said, "Yeah, we are".  
R:  [COUGH]  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, [MN].  [LIPSMACK]  Reading's another thing that I love to do.
R:  Oh, I do too.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I like, uh -- I'm reading a book by Nora Roberts right now.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she's --
L:  Midnight Bayou.  Have you read that?
R:  Uh, no, I've not read that one.  But I've read some of her books.  
L:  Uh-huh.  
R:  I'm doing --
L:  This one's good.
R:  -- a, uh --
L:  I hadn't, uh, uh --
R:  I'm doing a Jeffery Deaver right now called The Blue Nowhere.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's about computers and hackers.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And I'm -- oh, I'm [MN] just close to the end and this one is really good.  You know, it's -- it's amazing, you know, what -- what them hackers can do.  But it's -- it's like a murder --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mystery too.  So ...
L:  My husband's read -- read, like, Je- Jeffery Deaver.  He's read several -- some of his books.
R:  Uh.  Yeah, they're --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- they're -- they keep your interest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't get as much time to read as -- as I would like but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I still work part time too.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, do you work at all?
L:  No.  I retired in two thousand.
R:  Oh.
L:  I'm a retired nurse.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  [MN]  I retired in two thousand, so ...
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  And I've been so busy and I'm saying, " [MN] I don't know how I ever had time to work".  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Isn't that something, uh?  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd visioned all these long, lazy days but they never materialized.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  Just working part time it's like I feel like I don't have enough time in the day to --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- to do things.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, also scrapbooking's another hobby of mine.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That'll keep you busy.  
L:  I love to scrapbook.  I belong to -- to the [inaudible] Society, and I'm their historian so I keep their scrapbook also.
R:  Oh, how nice.  
L:  And, uh, [MN].  Like photography, I take a lot, you know, pictures in connection with my scrapbooks and ...
R:  Uh-huh.  I don't get too much into photography.  I'm just, you know, like ...
L:  I'm -- I'm the family photographer, I guess.
R:  Oh, well.
L:  Uh, and when you look through the [LAUGH] [MN] --
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm the one you don't see in the pictures usually --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- because I'm taking 'em.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's probably a, uh --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- good way to be.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I don't really like my picture taken that much.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Definitely.  I like to travel too.  I --
R:  Oh, yes.  I do too.  
L:  So have you gone any place lately?
R:  Um, well just within the state.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We went down state to a wedding in Osh Kosh, Wisconsin.  It's about four hours from here.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Three and a half, four hours.  And had a long weekend but, uh, it's been a while since I've been anywhere farther away.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  But I'd love to go more.  
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  You know.
L:  I, um, went to France, uh, with my sister in law for, uh, fourteen days, two years ago.
R:  Wow.
L:  Uh, well, actually it was three years ago.  [MN]  And we went on a tour.  We certainly enjoy- -- we really enjoyed it.
R:  Yeah, I bet.  
L:  This past year I went down to San Francisco to visit her.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, spent, uh, two weeks out there.  We went to flower shows and Yosemite Park and ...
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  Uh, just had -- had a big time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I love to travel.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of places I'd like to see yet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Never been out to California.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Been in -- as far as I've been is Arizona.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh, Las Vegas, out in there.  But, uh, Florida.
L:  Florida?
R:  Yeah.  Twice.  I've been to Florida two -- three times.  Three times I've been down there.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Uh.  My, uh, one -- one of my granddaughters moved down there for a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I helped her move.  And I drove the U-Haul.
L:  [MN]
R:  So then I spent a little time down there.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I can handle that.  Picking them oranges off the trees.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah, that's nice. 
R:  That's nice.
L:  Yeah.  When I talk about travelling [MN] my-- my -- my husband says we already live in paradise so why --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- should we ...
R:  That's true.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Have you ever been to Wisconsin?
L:  No, I haven't.  [several inaudible words]. 
R:  Oh.  
L:  I'd like to visit that part of the country sometime.
R:  It's -- it's really pretty, you know.  The trees and -- and the -- the four seasons.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah --
R:  But --
L:  -- I miss not ha- not having the four seasons down here.
R:  Right.  
L:  But -- well we do have four seasons but not --
R:  Not the snow and the cold.
L:  Not -- not -- we don't have the cold --
R:  Right.
L:  -- cold or if we have cold we have it, like, for two or three days and that's our winter.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's --
L:  And the autumns are not as spectacular of course.
R:  Right.  Oh, it's very pretty up here then.
L:  But, um, we have change of colors and stuff, they're just more -- a little more subtle than the --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We have the lavender and the gold wild flowers that come out, you know, during that time and all.  But --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it's not like all those beautiful leaves like you have up there.  
R:  Right.  Yeah, it's pretty.  Very pretty.  [MN]
L:  [MN]  So, uh, do -- do -- do you belong to R.M.C. magazine too, I guess, huh?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I -- I've belonged to that for quite a few years.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, God it's been --
