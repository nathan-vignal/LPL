L:  Hello.  This is Leeann from Indiana.
R:  Hi.  This is Lisa from Springfield, Missouri.
L:  The topic is hobbies.
R:  Yes.  I have lots of them.  I -- shopping is my first one.
L:  [LAUGH] I -- I make candles [LIPSMACK] and I rearrange flowers and then I think shopping probably falls in behind.
R:  I -- is it mystery shopping 'cause it's more of a business I guess more than a hobby?  But --
L:  No.  No.
R:  -- it's -- it's -- mine ...
L:  Shopping is a hobby for me just something to do.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, mine -- mine started out as a hobby and turned into a business I guess.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, that's m- -- that and I volunteer, um, a lot of time, you know, at the kids' schools. That's what I like to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I write.
L:  You write?  I spend a lotta time on the computer.  I guess that's a hobby too in a way.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It depends on -- depends on how you look at it.  I think sometimes it's a release.  I guess a hobby is a release too.  [LAUGH]
R:  It is.  Well, I spend a lotta time on -- in the -- on certain chat rooms, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't -- I never got much into the chat rooms.  Um, I started making candles about -- oh, 'bout eight months ago and -- and it's turned into a small business.  I wanted to do it just for a hobby.  I think everybody should have a hobby.  It's a -- it's a nice release.
R:  Oh, at least one, at least one.
L:  At least one, yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.
R:  Now -- and I read.  I love to read.
L:  I'm not a big reader.  As a matter of fact I don't T.V. much either though.
R:  Oh -- oh, see, I'm either on the computer or I'll read or I'm off doing something.
L:  Yeah.  I have to do something.  That's why I think hobbies are good for ya.  [LAUGH]  So, you're doing something.
R:  Yeah.  I -- I don't know that it has to be a physical hobby, you know, like sports.  I'd like to get out and do more, but I just don't.
L:  Something different.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But every ...
L:  I'd -- I'd like to get into flowers and -- and planting things, but I just, argh -- I just can't do it.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, now, I used to garden a lot.
L:  Yeah.  That -- yeah, every once in a while I'll plant something, but not very often.  [LAUGH]
R:  Do you know?  And I loved getting out when nobody was around and just, you know, playing in the garden --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or I'd -- we had a pond and go out and fish.  I used to consider that a hobby.
L:  [MN] Yeah, I guess you would.  And camping, I love to camp.
R:  And I would just sit out when nobody was around and fish.  I didn't have to catch anything and if I c- caught anything I'd release it because the whole point was just to sit out there.
L:  Yeah.  Just to sit out there and relax.  I have two kids.  So, that keeps me pretty busy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have a -- a four year old and an eleven year old.  So, it doesn't leave much room for a hobby.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, I -- I have ...
L:  Uh, the candle making is -- is an experience with a -- with a four year old, trust me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, see, I have three teenage kids.
L:  Oh, gosh.
R:  So, they're just -- they keep me real busy with sports and, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I volunteer to do all that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, no, there's not a lotta time and I tried candle making, but I really suck at it.
L:  [LAUGH] It -- it is definitely a, uh -- it's definitely an art.  There is a lot more to it.  When I first got into oh, you know, I'll just make 'em just for me just, you know, something to fiddle around with and -- and it didn't end up being so.  I didn't realize there was so much to it.
R:  I could never get the scent in there.
L:  You could never get it to smell?
R:  Right.
L:  Hm.  Yeah.
R:  'Cause obviously I don't know what I'm doing --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I didn't follow the directions very well either.
L:  There's different types of waxes and different types of wicks and all different stuff that makes a difference in whether it smells or not.
R:  Well, I couldn't figure it out.  So, I gave it up.  So, I have failed hobbies.  [LAUGH]
L:  That counts, doesn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I think I have some failed hobbies too.  Yeah.
R:  I tried to take up tennis.  That's another failed hobby.
L:  I think that would be so much fun.
R:  That's a failed hobby for me.  [LAUGH]
L:  You weren't very good, huh?
R:  No.
L:  Gosh, I -- that looks like it'd be so much fun.
R:  And I played softball.
L:  I did -- I did that too.
R:  But I suck at that too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]
R:  I was a catcher, but I can't hit either.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  So, I have -- I have a long line of failed hobbies.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Things you started and never finished.  I hate to say that I have that, but I do.  I have a --
R:  Oh, I ...  Yeah.
L:  -- I have a long list of things I started and never finished.  I work out five days a week.  I guess -- but that's not really a hobby, that's a -- in my eyes I have to.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  No, I need to.  I need to.
L:  I ...
R:  What -- what hobbies do you wanna try?
L:  [MN] Well, tennis.  I do believe that I would truly enjoy that.  It looks exciting to me.  Um [LIPSMACK], let me think.  What else would I wanna do?  Um [NOISE], I haven't really -- I wanna learn to ski.  That would be a nice hobby.  That seems like its way out there, but I think it'd be fun.
R:  Water ski or snow ski?
L:  Uh-uh.  Snow ski.  I know how to water ski.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I can't water ski very well either.  So, I'm sure that I would suck at ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you just never know.  You'll have to try 'em.  What hobbies would you wanna try that you haven't already?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that I haven't already.  Um, probably bike riding more.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'd like to start bike riding more.  I even bought a bike.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I can do it.  Maybe that starts a -- a start and I haven't finished yet.
L:  Well, that's okay, you'll get to it.
R:  [LAUGH] It's sitting in the gar- -- in the garage waiting if I can keep the kids off of it.
L:  You'll get to it.  Mm.  I don't know what else I ...  I'm thirty one.  So, I have a long way off to go I hope.
R:  Oh, I'm forty three.
L:  Well, see, you still have a long while to go too.  [LAUGH]
R:  You just have to tamper your -- your hobbies to your, uh -- you know, your age and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your physical ...
L:  I'm kinda -- believe it or not, I'm kinda old fashioned.  I love to bake.
R:  Oh.
L:  I love to bake but, I mean, that is -- I guess you would consider that a hobby because a lotta times it's not something we actually need, and I love to cook, and I just make things just to see if I can do it.
R:  Oh, that's a hobby.
L:  Cake decorating I would love to do that.  I would love to take classes and learn to do that as a hobby.  But I know that it would turn into a business.  So, I don't go there.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's how the candle thing happened.  I'm not doing that.
R:  Do you think most hobbies turn into a business?
L:  I believe they can, yes.  I -- I believe most hobbies do.
R:  Because it's something you love to do and ...
L:  Sure.  And -- and you do it enough and you get really good at it and then somebody else sees that it's something that you can really do and they think its quality and so there's your business [NOISE], or maybe just an extra side income.  Yeah.
R:  Well -- well, we all use that I think.
L:  Sure.  Yeah.
R:  An extra income.  Now that -- bec- like the shopping, uh, started out just as an experiment to see what it would be like.
L:  It was something you found on the Internet, wasn't it?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, I just -- and it was a hobby.  I just kinda did it off and on and did what I wanted and when I wanted, and it turned into a business because I enjoyed it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  I -- I think I signed up for something like that once, I was gonna do it as a hobby and [LAUGH] I never did do it.
R:  Mystery shopping?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I've got the kid and I don't know if I could take the kid with me.  I guess it would be even better if I did take the kid 'cause then it really would be mysterious, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh ...
L:  They even suspect it.
R:  Oh, lots of people do and they put the kid to work doing it.
L:  Yeah?
R:  Go back the bathroom [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and they do.  They'll come out, "It smells".  Okay, that one failed.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, that's -- you know, it ...
L:  And, you know, a lotta times I find that they didn't have things in my area.
R:  There is -- well, I guess you'd have to -- if you live in a small town you would have to travel.
L:  Oh, I'm close to Indianapolis.
R:  Oh, there would be lots of stuff.
L:  Yeah, you'd think.
R:  You just have to know where to look and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, there's that Internet again.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's all ...  I can --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I can sit down and --
L:  That -- that hobby.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm stuck.
L:  The thing is a world of information.
R:  I sit -- I sit down in the morning and night and probably don't leave until I have to go do something.
L:  Oh, I used to do that.  That's -- maybe -- maybe it truly is a hobby for me because I don't -- I don't know -- I don't stay on it as long as I used to.  I get up in the morning and do -- sit down and do a few things and then get the kids off and the husband -- the husband off and the kid off, the eleven year old, and then, you know ...?  So, it has become more of a hobby than -- I mean, it used to be an addiction.  [LAUGH]  I used to just sit there constantly.
R:  Oh, see, I -- I won't sit there and play games and ...
L:  Oh, I will.
R:  Oh, see, I don't do that.
L:  Pool at Yahoo.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My kids will do that a lot.
L:  But that's -- that's probably one of my worst a- addictions, yeah.
R:  Well, and another hobby is entering sweepstakes.
L:  I can't bring myself to do that.
R:  Oh, is that right?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Why?
L:  I'll never win.  What's the point?
R:  I haven't won anything major, but ...
L:  There's fifty million people all over the world entering the sweepstakes.
R:  But somebody has to win.
L:  I have entered some and won just, you know, little stuff but ...
R:  Weather band radio and, yep --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a book or a book bag.
L:  I won a case of pop hearts once entering a sweepstake.
R:  What was that?
L:  A whole entire case.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  A big truck pulled out in front of my house.  It was a semi.  [LAUGH]
