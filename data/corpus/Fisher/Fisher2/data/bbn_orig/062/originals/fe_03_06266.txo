R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi, my name's Janice.
R:  My name's Heather.
L:  Okay.  Uh, we're ...
R:  How are you?  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm pretty good.  Is this the first time you've done this?
R:  Um, I've done it a couple of times.
L:  I did before, but there could never find anybody for me to talk to.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, really?
L:  Do you -- do you have hobbies?
R:  Um, yeah, I actually like to do a lotta crafts.
L:  Oh, okay.  What kinda crafts?
R:  Um, I like to do, um -- like, um -- I don't know what you would call it exactly.  [LAUGH]  But I like to do scrap booking.
L:  Oh, a lotta people do that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not very creative.  I -- I didn't do too well.  I took a class in it one time, but I just can't come up with any ideas.
R:  Really?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.  I'm not too ...
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of -- it's kind of hard when, you know -- 'cause I always felt like that I was like so not crafty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  But my Mom really is into it.
L:  Oh.
R:  It's kinda like -- well, they -- they have their own business and they make jewelry.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I -- I kinda started out making some necklaces and stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then it just kind of progressed, and I do like, um, paintings on wood.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So ...  But ...
L:  Do you paint anything in particular?
R:  Um, well, really I just -- I just do mainly stuff for my house.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like I'll get, um, at Wool Mart or -- or a lotta stores they have just, uh, plain wood that's not finished or anything --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and either you can get the kind that has like the picture already on it or ...
L:  Oh, really?  I didn't know you could do that.
R:  Yeah.  Or you could do, um, you know, your own -- just make up your own thing.  But I -- I really am bad at drawing.  [LAUGH]  So, I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- usually try to get the stamped ones.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, um -- but -- and, um, my Mom has a friend that her hobby is painting on rocks --
L:  Oh --
R:  -- and, um --
L:  -- I've got a -- I've got one of those.
R:  -- those --
L:  -- well, it's a greyhound painted on a rock.
R:  -- are just beautiful.
L:  Yes.
R:  I mean, if the -- you know, if the person's really good, I mean --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they can turn out really nice.
L:  I've -- I've got one that an -- an eighty year old lady painted.  She was ...
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Well, I collect greyhounds.  [LAUGH]  I'm not really --
R:  Really?
L:  -- a collector.  I rescue greyhounds.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have, uh, the dogs, the racing dogs.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I have eleven of them and --
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  -- and, um, I -- I got a greyhound painting of one of my dogs.  An eighty year old lady painted it on a -- a rock for me.  It is so neat.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I thought it was so neat because of her being at that age too --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that it just -- oh, my gosh!
R:  Right.  That -- that she was able to do it, right?
L:  Yes.  And it was so good.  I still -- I have it.  I'll keep it forever.  [COUGH]  But we started rescuing greyhounds about four years ago and we're up to -- we're up to eleven now.  [LAUGH]  We have a house full 'cause they're inside dogs.  So, they stay in the house with us and we ...
R:  Oh, I hope you have a big house.
L:  Yeah, we do.
R:  Those are big dogs.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  Yes.  We have a pretty good sized house.  Our biggest one weighs ninety pounds and our smallest weighs forty nine.  So, they kinda -- we have nine girls and two boys and we love them, they're like our kids.  Our kids are grown and gone.  So, we --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so, we have greyhounds.  [LAUGH]  Now they're our kids.  We call them our T. troop because their names all start with T. --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they've come from -- they've come from all over the country, um, we have one -- one boy that came from Spain.  He -- we got him Spain last June and he didn't even understand English when we first got him.
R:  Wow!
L:  We would speak to him [LAUGH] and it was like "What are you talking about?"  But he's come a long well.
R:  [NOISE] So, it's like what are you saying?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  He had no idea.  I didn't know any Spanish.  So, we took him to a big greyhound gathering and there was a Spanish lady there and she talked to him and oh, he just put his head on her lap and looked up at her and it made me feel so sad 'cause I couldn't talk to him like that.
R:  Right.
L:  He just loved it.
R:  Oh.
L:  But he's -- he's come a long way.
R:  Right.
L:  Come a long way.  But we love them.  They're like our children.  We don't see our kids a whole lot.  They're all on their own, got their own families now and live quite a way a way away.  So --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we collect live things I guess.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know if it's a life -- it's kind of a hobby.
R:  My Mom --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- likes to collect strays.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, these are all rescued.  So, it's kinda the same thing.
R:  I remember --
L:  You just kind of --
R:  -- with our ...
L:  -- you feel so bad for them.
R:  Right.
L:  I do.
R:  I remember when I was growing up it would be -- because my Mom just loves cats and my Dad's more of a dog person --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, um, she just -- it's like -- I don't know -- well, we lived on a dead end street and we lived right off the interstate.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we would have a lotta people that would just throw their pets outta the car.
L:  Oh.
R:  Because we lived right -- right off the exit --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and it's like we would find a -- you know, the cats would kind of -- basically they'd kind of have to go down the road or they can climb through the fence, or whatever --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and you'd see these poor cats that were just all skinned up and [LAUGH] --
L:  Poor things.
R:  -- and my Mom would take 'em all in and it would seem like we'd go to the vet and, you know, she'd wanna keep 'em --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go to the vet and get 'em all fixed up, get all their shots and they'd run away.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Cats are kinda that way.
R:  So ...
L:  They -- they kinda like to wander.  You can't keep them penned up like you can a dog.
R:  Right.
L:  I really don't keep our dogs penned up.
R:  Unless they're ...
L:  We keep them in the house and they don't wander.
R:  Right.
L:  But we have a big fence though too.  We have a six foot fence around our yard so they can kinda --
R:  Right.
L:  -- we have sand run that we put in for them and ...
R:  And it's funny when I met my husband he hated cats and I think when I met him my Mom had like three or four cats and she had, uh, the one big --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, um, my husband's like "I hate your Mom's cats" because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- just because they're so lovey.  They always wanna lay on you.  They just want petted and sometimes they can be kinda of a pain 'cause, you know, you're having a bad day or whatever and you don't wanna mess with them and they -- they're like I need loving, you know, and, um, but [COUGH] when, uh -- my husband's in the military --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and when we -- you know, we had to move when we got married 'cause he got stationed in Virginia.  We had to move and the first thing I want is I want a kitten --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and it was funny because we moved there in the -- and it's c- -- it's colder there b- -- we -- we lived -- both came from [inaudible] and we weren't used to winter and stuff like that and so we got to Virginia in January and it was so cold and there were no kittens around because --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you know, there was I guess no mamas and papas giving any -- you know?  So, finally we got one and it was the hardest thing trying to get one because we lived --
L:  Oh, that's surprising.
R:  -- we lived right next to D.C. --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- in -- in the city.  So, it was kind of hard because either you had to go to a shelter and they wanted like a ton of money and they wanted to, you know, test your home and stuff --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I was like well, God, it's like adopting a kid, you know?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, so finally I got -- this woman traps mama cats, you know, pregnant cats and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and kinda like gives the kittens away.  So, anyway, we got this one and she's a bobtail, she has no tail --
L:  Oh, yeah, okay.  Is she a minx?
R:  -- and I don't know what -- what her problem ...
L:  Is she a minx?
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  All right.
R:  And, um, she's a tuxedo cat --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and she's so cute and we got her and she was so little and she's -- well, she's grown, she's four years old, but she looks like she's about a year old.  I mean, she's stayed really small.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  And he's like "I think that's the only cat I'll ever love --"
L:  Oh.
R:  "-- because she's so little".  'Cause you know how cats can get huge, you know?
L:  Oh, yeah, and -- and --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- I think they sense too when you're not real fond of them 'cause I'm allergic to cats --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and we -- we do home visits too.  We also have two miniature schnauzers and we do home visits, people who wanna rescue greyhounds or schnauzers --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it never fails if they have a cat [LAUGH] it's gonna sit on my lap and I get hives and my throat --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- swells up when I get near a cat and it's not --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- that I don't like 'em, I'm just allergic to them, and it never fails when I go in the home the cat will always jump on my lap and my husband will always try to get it to come on his lap and I finally usually tell the people, say, "I hate to tell you, but I'm allergic to your cat".  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But they just seem to sense -- when I would just sooner they stay away from me.  They just have a thing about them.  They know that, they know it --
R: Right.
L:  -- and it's not that I don't like -- my son had cats too and whenever I'd go over I had to take allergy medicine before I went to his house because I was just so allergic to them --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and went right on my lap [LAUGH] as soon as I walked through the door.
R:  This -- I mean [COUGH], this -- my cat and -- and, um, my husband actually he -- he was supposed to get of the army and then they extended him and I ended up moving into my Mom's house and so I'm kinda like stuck back in Florida while my husband is still in Virginia.
L:  Is he -- is he on -- on -- in duty right now?
R:  [COUGH] Yeah, but he's -- thank goodness he's not drafted anywhere overseas.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  And he's supposed to get out next month.
L:  Oh.
R:  They're gonna let him out.  They've already given him his discharge papers and everything.
L:  [NOISE] Okay.
R:  But this cat has just -- just basically said, "Well, since you're at work all day and you don't love me anymore, I'm just gonna adopt your Mom" [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- because she will not have like anything to do with me anymore, and she loves my Mom --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and she -- like, I think every day she's -- she's an inside cat and every day she goes outside for lizards.
L:  Oh.
R:  She loves lizards.  [COUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  [MN]
R:  And she'll just carry them around in her mouth and I think it's so cute, you know?
L:  Does she eat them?
R:  Huh?
L:  She'll just carry them around?  She doesn't eat them?
R:  Uh-uh.  She just -- usually she'll just kill 'em.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ah.
R:  She's really mean.  I'm like "You look how mean you are" and ...
L:  No, she's predatory.
R:  Yeah.  And, of course --
L:  That's what it is.
R:  -- here we have the huge roaches, the [inaudible] they call 'em.
L:  [MN]
R:  The flying ones.
L:  [MN]
R:  Oh, my God!  I just get the willies --
L:  I do too thinking about it.
R:  -- and she chases them around.
L:  [MN]
R:  She's the bug -- she's the bug cat.  [LAUGH]  She chases all the bugs around.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's good.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  I'd want her around if I had big bugs like that.  No, thanks.
R:  I'm like -- and my -- and my little three year old he's like "Look, Mommy, a big bug, a big bug".
L:  [MN]
R:  And I'm like -- and I can't look at it.  I just get the chills and ...
L:  Do these bugs bite or anything?
R:  Huh?
L:  Or do they just kinda ...?  These bugs are just a nuisance, or do they bite, or ...?
R:  Um, no, they just -- they're just a pain.
L:  They're just a nuisance?
R:  It's ...  Yeah.
L:  [MN] Yuck.  I don't like bugs.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, me neither.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I mean, the only ones I like are like the little ones --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that don't bother you, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Like ladybugs or something like that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Well, we get those bad though in the fall.  They come in and they're -- they're everywhere --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and they have -- they're -- they're called like -- we have like stink bugs though and they have this horrible smell to them.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Where -- where do you -- where do you come from?
L:  Ohio.
R:  Ohio?
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause, um, we -- my parents are from Kentucky --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and -- and so, yeah -- and -- and -- oh, my gosh!  The bugs there are like [MN].
