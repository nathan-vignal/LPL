R:  Hi.  Mona.
L:  Hi.  I'm Leah.
R:  Hi.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Hobbies.
R:  Hobbies.  What are some of your hobbies?
L:  Well, I guess -- I don't know.  Like what's the difference between hobbies and pastimes?
R:  Um, I don't know if there's a difference.
L:  Okay.  Um, 'cause I guess hobbies -- I -- I sometimes -- I -- I make movies, like little films --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and I don't know in terms of like -- I don't know.  Like I don't -- I don't make too many other things artistically, um, except for mixed tapes.  I guess that's a -- that's a sort of hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  What about you?
R:  Um, I cook a lot.  I'm actually cooking right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and I'm like involved in -- well, testing recipes and working on this cookbook --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in my spare time.  Um ...
L:  You're creating a cookbook?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I'm helping create one.
L:  That's cool.  What's the emphasis in the cookbook?
R:  Um, it's the -- have you heard of Craig's List?
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.
R:  I don't know where you are.  But, um, it's like the Craig's List Community Cookbook.  So, it's a compilation of recipes, um, submitted by people who, uh, hang out in the food form there --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and like exchange recipes and so on, um, and the proceeds are supposed to go to profit, um -- well, not profit, but go to, uh, local non profits.
L:  Okay.  That's really cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well, so like do you find -- you -- you spend a lot of time cooking then I guess?
R:  Um, yeah, and I also write and I have two guinea pigs that I take care of.  I don't know if that counts as a hobby or not.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm not sure either.  That's what's weird is like I'm not sure how -- hobby seems like such an antiquated term, like it seems like for ...
R:  Collecting coins or something?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Like -- yeah, like making macrame, like crafts or something.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I'm like ...
R:  But like macrame.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.  But now it's like expected I think that everyone -- like anything that's not just watching T.V. I guess is like [LAUGH] a hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Things like -- I don't know, um, that's ...  Okay.  Have you done a lot of these phone conversations?
R:  Um, this is my third one.
L:  Me too actually, I'm still sort of getting the -- the hang of them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, so, how -- like how did you start cooking?  Was it something that you -- your Mom did a lot, or your father, or ...?
R:  No, um, I've been eating all my life [LAUGH], but I haven't really been cooking for that long --
L:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- um, let's see, probably since, um, ninety eight or something like that, ninety nine.  Um, basically I went away to college and then I had to learn how to cook when I went and lived by myself for the first time --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and actually I lived in coops, um, and that was the first time I really had to learn how to cook because one of my work shifts that I ended up getting was cooking for the whole house --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was like a house of sixty people.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  And up to then I had only really been doing like grilled cheese sandwiches and stuff like that.  So, I had to learn how to cook in a hurry and nothing quite teaches you how to cook, like cooking for a house of sixty [LAUGH] --
L:  And then, I mean ...
R:  -- with three hours to do it.
L:  But like I guess I suppose like you enjoyed it even more than just on a sustenance level or, you know, if it's become something that you wanna -- that you contribute to a cookbook and that sorta thing.
R:  Yeah, it's kinda become an obsession.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, like what sorts of things do you like to cook the most?
R:  Um, I guess I like to make a lot of stews.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like right now I'm making a chickpea stew.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I don't know.  Like I -- I don't really tend to cook like one thing over and over again.  So, it's kinda hard for me to say.  But I guess, uh, pasta.  I cook a lotta pasta too.
L:  Right.  But, I mean, do you like to cook things that, um -- that are really challenging?  Like -- well, also do you -- do you cook meat?
R:  Um, I don't usually cook meat.
L:  Okay.  But, um, do you -- like -- like I think sometimes like with -- with souffles or things like that that are really -- a little bit more -- it seems like there's a lot more, um [LIPSMACK], specialized preparation steps, you know, or something -- do you -- do you enjoy doing things like that that are particularly challenging?
R:  Oh, sometimes.  I mean, I guess it depends what kind of mood I'm in.  Like, if I feel like doing something complicated, you know?  I'll frequently try things that are probably pretty dumb of me try [LAUGH] like souffles.  Last time I made a souffle it came out like totally flat and kinda bready, but ...
L:  [LAUGH] That's cool though.  Yep.  I don't know in terms of other hobbies that I have, uh, it's hard for me to say.  Like right now I'm -- I'm also helping organize a closet and I [LAUGH] -- I find organizing to be -- it's like -- almost like a hobby in and of itself.  But --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's usually that I'm organizing other things that I have as projects that I wanna do as hobbies, but instead I just get caught up more in the organization of them.  Like I'll collect clippings from magazines to make collages with --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- but I'll just collect [inaudible] that sooner or later it becomes more of a -- the organization of them than the actual collage that's like the product --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so, I'm kinda frustrated right now by my -- I think that organ- organizing is my -- is my real hobby and not --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- any other things that I'm actually ...
R:  Well, I think my Mom would agree with you 'cause she loves organizing stuff --
L:  I don't -- it's ...
R:  -- um, she'll just like take a weekend and go and like reorganize the garage and I'm like, "I thought the garage was already organized".  But she goes out and buys new boxes and comes up with a new scheme and, you know, spends the whole weekend just going through everything in the garage.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  It's not like I have like some sort of product that comes out of it, but I do feel that it is a somewhat aesthetic experience because I -- I tend to get really like O.C.D. about making things symmetrical and, you know, like just --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- cleaning things up in a really nice way or something.  I don't know.  It kinda makes me crazy but, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  Or it's kind of like that whole like nineteenth century, like taxonomy thing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, that was basically just a big craze for organizing, you know?
L:  That's true.
R:  Like they all wanted to organize every single animal they found [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and that was like essentially, you know, how they came up with this whole classification of animals.
L:  But this ...
R:  I have a call waiting.  I don't really know what I'm supposed to do about that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  Um, I don't know.  I haven't had that either, um ...
R:  I guess I'll just ignore it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's going be like a series of beeps on the recording though.
L:  Well, that's true.  Um, are you -- so where are you based?
R:  Huh?
L:  Where -- like where do you live?
R:  Oh, I live in Berkeley.
L:  Okay.  I live in --
R:  Where do you live?
L:  -- Philadelphia.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  But I -- I just sometimes wonder where someone lives dictates the sort of hobbies that they have also, if you're -- I don't know -- like if you -- if you live somewhere that's more urban and there's not so much to do, like, uh, as many recreational opportunities perhaps --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that -- that that in turn makes you develop hobbies that are more domesticated or --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I don't know.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Or maybe it's more like the type of person that you are is what defines the sort of hobbies that you develop.
R:  Yeah.  That's kind of interesting.  Um, I mean, I've noticed there's this like big trend of, uh, sort of old school hobbies --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, among like young, fashionable, hip, urban people.
L:   Right.  Like the knitting?
R:  Yeah, like the knitting thing or -- there's this magazine out here called Ready Made ...
L:  Yeah, we got that here too.
R:  Yeah.  And they've started it here in Berkeley and so ...
L:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I like reading Ready Made, but it's -- and I -- I've done like a few of the -- well, I've tried to do a few of the things.  But like it's always more like wow, I'm -- I'm amazed that people have found these creative ways to reuse products, use, uh, materials.
R:  Uh-huh.  It's pretty inspiring.
L:  But it's -- it's a little intimidating otherwise [LAUGH], like I don't see myself making a -- a table with an embedded L.C.D. display or whatever.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I know if I -- if I wanted to ...
R:  It was like -- like one of the projects they had?
L:  I think recently, yeah, it was [LAUGH] one of the -- the issues.  They're just like -- or -- I don't know -- it's -- it's -- it's -- it's really interesting to me to read, but I just don't know if I'll ever get around to doing those things and it's like it's -- it's weird because it's like -- it's like being a hobby enthusiast without actually doing any of the hobbies myself, you know, like just vicariously --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- building through the person writing it.  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Did you see that one that was like a -- a lawn chair that you build on your lawn?
L:  Oh, you mean like the sofa made out of grass?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  But I -- I just was thinking more of the idea that I would never wanna side on something that would give me grass stains, you know, like --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it was -- it's really neat looking, but --
R:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
L:  -- I -- I doubt I would ever use it practically.  I don't know.  Um, what was the other question that we were supposed to -- are we supposed to like answer the questions succinctly or anything, like do you think everyone should have at least one hobby?  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] What?
L:  Like, what was the -- the last question?  Do you think everyone should have at least one hobby or something?
R:  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Um, I don't know.  I mean, I don't think it's necessary to have a hobby.  But, I mean, if -- if you feel happy just like not doing anything like in particular --
