L:  Hello.
R:  Hi.  I'm Amy.
L:  Hi.  This is Amy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Hi.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Hi.  
R:  [LAUGH]  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.  How are you?
R:  Pretty good.  
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, okay.
L:  [MN]  Hobbies.
R:  Hobbies.  All right, um, what are your hobbies?
L:  Well, I, um, I do a lot of reading.  I like to read magazines and, um, mostly like health magazines, Psychology Today, things like that.  Um, and I do a lot of crafty type things.  I like to crochet and I do artwork.  
R:  All right.  What types of artwork do you do?
L:  Um, I do painting, drawing, pastels.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  How did -- how did you [MN] start doing that?  How did you get involved in that?
L:  What's that?
R:  How did you -- did you teach yourself or did you take classes or anything on that?  On the --
L:  I -- [MN]
R:  -- painting and drawing.
L:  Yeah, well, when I was in high school I took some art classes and I really liked it but I, um, I never had any, like, real formal training but I'm pretty good at it and, I guess, kind of a natural.  [LAUGH]  I guess. 
R:  Oh, great.
L:  Yeah.  But nobody really ever taught me how to exactly do anything.  Um, so it's pretty cool.  How -- how 'bout you?
R:  [MN]  Um, well, I like to go to the gym.  I like to read.  Um, I just started, um, making jewellery of my own.  
L:  Oh.
R:  Um ...
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yeah, I like to travel.  Um, let's see, what else?
L:  Yeah.  Everybody likes to travel.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Exactly.
L:  What kind of jewellery do you make?  Like beads --
R:  Um --
L:  -- or like ...?
R:  Like with, um, right now I'm just doing [MN] covered beads and stones.  Like trying to -- I just started.  And I'm trying to, like, learn how to string beads and make, um, jewellery into my [several inaudible words].  Um --
L:  Oh, that's --
R:  -- things like that.  I just started.  It's pretty cool.  I mean, I -- there's so many things that you can do with it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, instead of just like basic, like, little beads.  [MN]  You can do some pretty neat th- things.  Trying to learn the basics right now and ...
L:  Right.
R:  Put the [inaudible], um -- I'd love to turn it into something where I did, I guess, I don't know, make -- I don't know, may- maybe like a part time job out of it, or something, or ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or [inaudible].
L:  That's a good idea.  I saw, um, [LIPSMACK] -- some ladies were selling earrings at the beach last year and a couple of years ago, everything that was handmade, and they were saying how easy and inexpensive it is really.  You just need, you know, you go to a craft store, you buy a whole bunch of stuff.  It costs you, like, twenty dollars and --
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  They were making a huge profit off of it so ...
R:  Yeah, exactly.  There's a woman I work -- I work at a, um, a software company and a -- a woman I work with, her sister is, um, an airline attendant.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she goes to -- she flies to Asia pretty often.  Like, uh, she's on some Asian airline.  And, um, she brings back, like, these pearls that are real cheap over there but here they're pretty pricey, I guess.
L:  Right.
R:  And, like, freshwater stones and stuff that you can only get over there.  And then th- this woman I work with, her sister makes jewellery out of it.  Like, basically, she just strings.  She doesn't even do anything herself innovative with it.  She sells it for, like, crazy amounts of money and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Eventually going to stop work and do that full time so that's kind of inspiring me to [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- do something with [inaudible].
L:  Yeah, that's great.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  When you have something that you enjoy doing like that and then you can actually make a living out of it.  That would be ideal.
R:  Yeah, that would be ideal.  [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, so do you go to the beach too?
L:  Uh, yeah --
R:  [inaudible] -- as a hobby?
L:  Yeah, actually that's another -- I guess that's another hobby.  I love to go to the beach.  I wish I was closer to a beach.  Like the closest one is, I don't know, about an hour and forty five minutes away so ...
R:  Oh, okay.  Where do you live?
L:  I live upstate New York.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So there's really -- the closest one would be Connecticut.  And then, um, in New York -- I used to live in Westchester so it was a lot easier to, you know -- I really liked to -- to go to the beach.  Up here they have like, I don't know, big lakes and I'm not too fond of that.  I like the ocean and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't want to swim in the little pond or a lake, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It feels like -- it always feels slimy to me.  I don't -- [LAUGH] I don't -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- for some reason.
L:  Mhm.  
R:  Like on the bottom.  
L:  [MN]
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Oh, well
R:  Well, let's see.
L:  I love to [several inaudible words].
R:  Do you -- what kinds of books do you like to read?
L:  What's that?
R:  What kinds of books do you like to read?
L:  Um, well --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- actually I mostly read [LAUGH] text books because I go to school at night.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, um, I do a lot of that.  But, you know, I actually enjoy it.  So that's not bad.  It's all --
R:  That's good.
L:  -- psychology books.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay.  And you said psycho- -- the magazine as well?
L:  Yeah.  I like that too.  And what --
R:  [MN]  
L:  What kind of books do you read?  Novels or ...?
R:  Um, yeah.  Novels.  Um, I just finished, uh, finished the Lord of the Ring series.  And now I'm reading books that are on [LIPSMACK] -- they're written by [several inaudible words].  [several inaudible words] they're, um, sort of like action books, kind of.  
L:  Mm.
R:  They're [MN] kind of like -- I [inaudible] none of them ever been made into movies, like, but they'd be like a real good action movie.  They're -- it's about this guy who works for this, um -- he's like a marine biologist but he does, like, all this stuff with, I don't know -- he always, like, saves the world but it -- it's pretty interesting though.
L:  Yeah, that is interesting.
R:  That's what I'm reading now.  
L:  Uh.  I haven't read a novel in so long.  I'm like ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Really.  Why, because you're busy with school?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I try to find time to do -- then my neighbor, actually, she's a little bit older but she's always saying, you know, "Oh, crocheting is great" and I'm thinking, "Uh, I don't know.  That's something I'm gonna do when I'm retired" you know. 
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  But I -- she showed me beautiful blankets that she had made and she says, "Oh, it's so relaxing.  You should do it".  So she taught me that, and I picked that up and actually it really is.  Like at night before I go to bed, or if I don't feel like studying, it's like at least you have something that you can continuously work on.  It feels like you're accomplishing something.  You know, you get to like --
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  -- see the progress.  Yeah, so ...  And then you have a finished product, you know, that you can -- they're always good for, like, baby showers or -- 
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  -- as a present or something. So that works out well.  I really -- I really enjoy that.  I only know one -- one stitch right now.  I have to look into it and get a little bit fancier with it but I guess ...
R:  Oh, that's really neat.  Is it -- is it difficult to learn it or [MN] you picked it up pretty easily?
L:  No.  It -- it was very easy.  The only thing is she's left handed and I'm right [LAUGH] handed.  
R:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  So we got a little [MN] confused.  I tried to face her to learn it but, um, I don't know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- somehow I ended up learning a stitch that she doesn't even know how to do.  I guess just by the way --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [LAUGH] we were set up.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  She's like, "How do you do [LAUGH] that?"  [LAUGH]  And I'm like --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  --"Well, how do you do [LAUGH] that?"  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So that's kind of funny.
R:  [several inaudible words].  Have you, like, finished anything yet or are you working on your first project?
L:  Actually, I did finish -- my first blanket was last year.  I did a baby blanket.  My sister in law was pregnant and I, like, just finished just in time when the baby was born.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  So, uh, they're like, "Oh, we love it".  [LAUGH]  It's so [MN] --
R:  [MN]
L:  It's heavy, though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's pretty heavy.  I'm like, "Well, don't give it to him until he gets a little bit older [LAUGH] 'cause --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- I don't he can move around in it".  It weighs so much.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, uh, yeah.  So I enjoy it.  And I have a -- a cat which keeps me busy and ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  And a fish.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, mm, no dogs.  Dogs are too much work for me --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- right now.  I'm too busy with working full time and school and everything.  I c- -- I don't think I could handle a dog.
R:  Yeah, they are a lot of work.  I used to have one of those.
L:  Mm.
R:  It's so difficult.  I felt so guilty when I would go to work all day and leave him home alone and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Very difficult.  But -- they're fun to have, but ...  I might get a -- I was thinking about a cat too.  [several inaudible words] too, like, little friend [several inaudible words].  Um ...
L:  [MN]  
R:  Can you hear me okay?  I'm going through a -- a -- I'm going over a bridge and I don't know if the reception's any good.
L:  I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing you now.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know if ...
R:  I'm going over a bridge.  Can you hear me okay?
L:  Yeah.  Kind of.  You're like in and out a little bit.  
R:  Yeah, I think it's [several inaudible words] like that.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Sorry.  I'm on a cell phone.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so okay.
L:  So, uh, yeah, so they were --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- asking if you think everybody should have a hobby.
R:  Oh [several inaudible words].  Um, yeah.  I definitely think everyone should have a hobby.  It's -- you know, sometimes it's hard, like, when you work all day, you come home and may not feel like doing something else besides [MN] whatever, relaxing, but I think it's really important to have a hobby because it, um -- I don't know why.  Because I -- I don't know why I think -- it just -- it helps you grow and helps you [inaudible]. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Be the person you are, I guess. 
L:  Yeah, and it keeps you -- it keeps you sane.  [LAUGH]  You know.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But I -- you know, now that I think about it, like all the things we're bringing up, pets and all that.  I mean, that's, you know, kind of a hobby too.  Taking care of your pets and playing with them or whatever.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But n- now that I think about it.  I +find -- I find it kind of an odd question.  Like who doesn't have some kind of a hobby?
R:  Like, I think you kind of -- just by nature
