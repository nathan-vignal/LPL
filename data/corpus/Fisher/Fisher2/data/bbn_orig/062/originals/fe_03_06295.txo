L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  [NOISE]
R:  Who am I talking to?
L:  This is Laurie.
R:  I'm Margaret.
L:  Oh, hi, Margaret.
R:  Where do you live?
L:  Indianapolis.
R:  My goodness.  I'm in Mississippi.
L:  Huh?
R:  I'm in Mississippi.
L:  Oh, Mississippi?
R:  Yes.  I hear a baby.
L:  Huh?
R:  I hear a baby.
L:  Oh, that's my six year old in the back seat of the car.
R:  Oh.
L:  We're driving down the street.  We're going home from my boyfriend's house.
R:  What time is it there?
L:  Oh, ten o'clock.
R:  It's about that here.  Ten thirty I think.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  What are we supposed to talk about?
L:  I think we're supposed to talk about hobbies.
R:  Oh, what do you do?
L:  Um, play on the Internet and [NOISE] -- play on the Internet and talk to my boyfriend and [LAUGH] ...  Huh?
R:  I play on the Internet a lot too.
L:  Yes.
R:  But I do -- I do woodwork and painting.
L:  Oh, gosh.  I'm just always on the Internet talking and chatting and playing games.
R:  I do that a lot.  Have you ever been to a site called Freebie Fix?
L:  Freebie what?
R:  Freebie Fix.  F.I. --
L:  I haven't been ...
R:  -- F.I.X.  It's a good one.
L:  Oh, I haven't been to that one.  I'll have to check it out.  I ...
R:  It's a, um -- not really a chat room.  It's, um, a board.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  You put ...
L:  Oh, it's kinda like, um -- I use my coupons a lot.  So, it's probably a bit like that, isn't that?
R:  Yeah, it is.  It's about freebie stuff and coupons and all that kinda stuff.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I love it and, uh ...
L:  That's what I do too.
R:  Yes.
L:  I usually use the My Coupons, but it's pretty much probably the same thing.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.  We've got a chat room and I go there and talk half the day.
L:  Oh, gosh!
R:  But then I don't have to clean house and take care of no kids either.
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I don't have to take care of him during the day while I'm at work.
R:  Well, I don't work either.  So ...
L:  Oh, that must be nice.  I work all the time, plus I just got done with school.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm disabled.
L:  Oh.
R:  I have had -- I've had two strokes and I'm ...
L:  [NOISE] You what?
R:  I've had two strokes and I'm in a wheelchair.
L:  [MN]
R:  So, I don't do much but play on the Internet and such as that.
L:  We just got home.
R:  So, you're -- you're talking on a cell phone?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Oh.
L:  After nine o'clock the, uh, hours or -- or the minutes are free.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, I can talk all I want.
R:  Yes.
L:  But before nine o'clock then you've gotta pay for the minutes.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I try to limit them.  I mean, I have two hundred and fifty of 'em a month anyway.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But I try to limit 'em.
R:  My daughter has a cell phone.  She goes to college.  That's how I keep in touch with her.
L:  Some people that's all they have.  They don't even have a real phone.  They just have a cell phone.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  [NOISE] Two kitty cats that think that they're -- I guess that's another hobby right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Taking care of them.  [LAUGH]
R:  I guess so.  I have one.  Do you have any dogs?
L:  No, no dogs.
R:  Oh.
L:  Just the two cats.
R:  Right.
L:  The house is already big enough.  My boyfriend has a dog.  [LAUGH]
R:  I have a German Shepherd.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I bet he helps you out a lot though.
R:  Well, she.  But, no, she's not allowed in the house.
L:  Mm.  Oh, she isn't?
R:  No.  She's an outside dog only.
L:  [NOISE] Huh?
R:  She's an outside dog only.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And so is my cat.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My hus- -- my husband is allergic to her.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, she has to live outside.
L:  I thought maybe she was one of those kinds of dogs that brought you like things like when you're on --
R:  No.
L:  -- in the wheelchair and stuff.
R:  I wish she was.  I have ...
L:  Well, with being a German Shepherd a lot of them -- a lotta times they will make those into --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a dog like that.
R:  I have trouble picking up things I drop.  I've got a reacher that's supposed to do stuff like that, but I usually can't find it.
L:  Mm.  [PAUSE]  It seems like that there would be like a, um, hook or something on your wheelchair to put it on.
R:  No, there's not.  It's always in the way.
L:  Mm.
R:  I tried to.
L:  [NOISE] He likes to go over there and watch movies.
R:  Yeah.  Do you do very many surveys?
L:  Yes, I do a lot.
R:  I do too.
L:  It gets me over- -- it's something I can do after work where --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- with him here and then after I get off work I can do the surveys and stuff and it's better than doing overtime 'cause then I would have to be at work.
R:  Yes.  I love doing surveys.  I love to them checks coming in.
L:  Mhm.  Well, for me it's just fun money, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, it's not like I have to have it to pay my bills or anything, but --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- it's always extra fun money.
R:  My survey money is my money to blow.
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH]  Go get dinner and ...  Yeah, I just went and, um -- we picked up dinner, me and my boyfriend, and we went over there and we watched movies and it's not like it was super fun with -- with the kid there, but at least ...
R:  How many kids do you have?
L:  Just one.  Just him.
R:  I have three.
L:  Three of 'em?
R:  But mine are all grown.
L:  Oh.
R:  I have three kids and three grandkids.
L:  Oh --
R:  I live ...
L:  -- three little grandkids are like yours too.
R:  And I have one that lives with me.  His ...
L:  How old is ...?  Huh?
R:  His Daddy is in the army and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he's over in, uh, Korea right now and his Mama can't take care of him by herself or she ...
L:  Oh, she can't?
R:  She says she can't.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, I've got him for the rest of the year.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH] He's all wired up 'cause he's had two Mountain Dews tonight while we was watching movies.
R:  Oh, he's on a sugar high.
L:  Well -- and caffeine too, it was diet Mountain Dew.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, at least the sugar wasn't there, but still it's [NOISE] ...  He, um -- I -- he didn't -- Scott didn't have anything else there to drink.  So, I didn't gripe too much about him drinking all the Mountain Dew.  It was either or beer.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I mean, I guess he could've drunk water.  But he just moved in last weekend.  So, he doesn't even have his cups or anything like that ready even.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, it was better that he drink out of the can.
R:  Mountain Dew has a lot of caffeine.
L:  Yes, it does [LAUGH], even the diet.
R:  My husband drinks them.  I know.
L:  [LAUGH] That's why he's this hyper at ten thirty at night and we went over there, we watched Like Mike.  It's a D.V.D. 'cause it was something that keeps him occupied that we didn't care to watch.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it -- it kept him occupied.  So, we could talk.  [NOISE]  Huh?
R:  Sounds like you had a good time.
L:  Yeah.  Scott's cool anyway.  So ...  [NOISE]
