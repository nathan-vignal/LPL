L:  Hello?
R:  [MN]  Hello.  
L:  Hi, I'm Michelle.
R:  Hi, I'm Amanda from --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- Florida.
L:  I'm from California.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Opposite --
L:  Hot.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ends.  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Uh --
L:  Hot.
R:  Well, I have a few hobbies.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I do too.  What are yours?
R:  Uh, we- -- the -- one of my main hobbies is showing dogs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So I go around mo- -- mainly in Florida.  And I have Chinese Crested that I show.
L:  Oh, I've got a Chihuahua and a Dachsie.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Spoiled brats.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, let's see what do I like to do?  Um, collect c- -- I collect, um, cats.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Cat stuff.  Not actual [LAUGH] cats. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Although we do have six.  
R:  Cats.  I have one cat.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  He stays outside.
L:  We've got six and they all took over the bed so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's what my dogs try to [LAUGH] do.  
L:  Think we need to get a new -- a new house with four bedrooms and let each kid have a bedroom and the cats have a [LAUGH] bedroom.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, my dogs have a dog room.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  That's kind of necessary [LAUGH] when you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- show 'em and you have -- uh, right now I have four dogs that are adults and I have a litter of puppies.  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  We took our, um, our Dachsie to a -- a dog show.  It was just a, um, open to the public.  Whoever wanted to enter could enter it.  And she was so uncooperative.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  She just -- we get on the stage and you're supposed to walk her across the stage and she just laid down and said forget it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I said, "Okay, I'll pick you up and carry you".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah --
L:  But --
R:  -- it's always fun when they decide they want to do what they want to [LAUGH] do.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But they're dogs.
L:  She decided -- oh, she got a participant ribbon so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  The kids were happy.
R:  Yes.  Uh, mine get ribbons sometimes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Sometimes they mean something and sometimes they don't.  
L:  Yeah.  What are your dogs' names?
R:  I have, um, Calvin Klein.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Calvin.  And I have Rosie.  And Cloudy and Flame.  The --
L:  We have --
R:  -- babies don't have names yet.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Next week.
L:  Our Chihuahua puppy's named Kellyante[?].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  We call her Kelly.  And then our -- our Dachsie is Emma.  And our cats are too many to [LAUGH] name.
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]
L:  Just call, "Here, kitty kitty" and they all come.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, one of the best parts is getting to have puppies.  [LAUGH]  Raising the puppies.  Like right now I have four babies and they all turned out to be hairless which is good, but I was hoping for at least one [LAUGH] puff.
L:  [LAUGH]  My, um, brother in law had one of those but it was a -- Chinese Crested, you said?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, he had the hair- -- one of the hairless ones.  
R:  Yeah.  I have two hairless and two puffs.
L:  [MN]
R:  And then a whole litter of hairless.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mom was a puff so I was expecting at least some puffs.  [LAUGH]  I get all hairless.
L:  We're trying to decide whether to breed the -- the Chihuahua or not.  But they have so many problems giving birth sometimes, so we're kind of hesitant.  
R:  Yeah, the little ones can have more trouble.  
L:  Yeah.  Her mom had five, so ...  [LAUGH]  I'm kind of worried.  She's little.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  She's probably gonna be under five pounds, full grown.
R:  Yeah.  It's hard on them when they're that little.
L:  Yeah.  So we just -- I told my husband I don't think I want to risk it.  [MN] 
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, there's so many things that can go wrong.
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  Uh ...
L:  [NOISE]  Kids, kids, kids.
R:  [LAUGH]  I'm a teacher too, so ....
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I deal with kids all day long.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I used to [SIGH] -- I worked at, um, for, um, Special Ed.  I was a te- a teacher's aid for Special Ed.
R:  That's kind of --
L:  For ...
R:  -- what my class is but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  For a while I did that and -- and had to quit because I had this -- I have to be here 'cause my kids are going to two separate schools so it was impossible to coordinate.  I had my mom babysitting and it was impossible to [MN] coordinate her picking 'em up at two different places and ...  It's a mess, so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's on hold.  
R:  Yeah.  I just have my little dogs.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  And they want --
R:  I have a bunch of shows coming up lately in -- in June I'll have a bunch of shows.
L:  I'm wanting to go.  I'm wanting to go to a show.  I haven't really gone to a real, you know, a professional type dog show.
R:  Uh-huh.  To an A.K.C. show?
L:  Huh?
R:  Uh, to an A.K.C. show?
L:  Yeah.  I've gone [MN] -- mostly it's just amateur charity ones and things like that.  
R:  Yeah.  It's kind of fun.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, they're --
R:  More fun -- it's more fun when you win but ...
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  They're not as -- they're -- I guess they're not as high pressure.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Well, the real dog shows can be -- can be a mess.  You got the handlers and everybody wants to win and only two dogs can win.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  From each breed.  
L:  So that's hard.  
R:  Yeah.  And then you -- your dog wins and then there's no majors so you can't [LAUGH] get a championship on him.  [MN]  Makes it -- makes it kind of frustrating.  
L:  Yeah, my son's hobby is colle- -- is go-carts.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's a hobby I wish he hadn't picked up.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  My husband's friend bought him a go-cart for his eighth birthday.  I was not happy.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That could -- that's -- that's an expensive hobby.
L:  I said, "Do you want -- y- you bought him what?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'll be in the house.  I don't want to watch.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH]  So far so good.  He hasn't gotten hurt and he's ten now, [LAUGH] so ...
R:  Yes.
L:  But that's his thing.  Him and my husband, so ...  They -- at least they have that.  They can do it together.
R:  [LAUGH]  My dad and my brother used to do the little planes that you fly in the rocket.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]  They'd always be out there putting a rocket off or ...  Go to his -- go to a place to fly the little plane.  
L:  It sounds like something my daughter would want to do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I think my dad liked it more than my brother [LAUGH] but ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It was just his excuse to my mom.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, I'm -- I'm doing it for -- for him, yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Doing it for the kid.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  And the kid's like, "Do we have to go?"  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yep, I think that's -- that'd be something my daughter -- daughter would like.  She doesn't like [MN] -- she's a tomboy.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  It's like forget the Barbies, forget the dolls.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  In fact she told me when she was three, "Mom, I hate Barbies.  Don't buy me anymore".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay, fine.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And then the relatives start sending more.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, she -- every year for Christmas that's what she'd get from grandpa and uncles.  And it's like, "Mom, I don't like Barbies".  
R:  [LAUGH]  Just smile and ... [LAUGH] 
L:  She'd always -- at least she was always, you know, polite.  "Thank you".  When we get home it's "I hate Barbies".  Can we re- --"
R:  Well, let's go to Walmart and exchange it.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah, let's return these.  Can we return these?
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  She learned real early, exchange.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [NOISE]  Exchange this, mom.  I don't like it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So she'd go and get robots or -- or, um, action [LAUGH] figures.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE]  
R:  [MN]
L:  Seems like everytime I get on the phone they want [LAUGH] something.
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't have that problem 'cause -- my kids at school they always bug me but at home I don't have any kids so ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Do yours like the little Pokemon cards?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  They're --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- everywhere.
R:  I'm always taking those from the kids at school.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, our school's banned 'em.  They're not allowed to bring 'em anymore.  
R:  [MN]  They're not allowed to bring 'em to our school either but everyday ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I have to take 'em from somebody.  "Uh, but --"
L:  Yes.
R:  "-- that's my Pokemon card".  [LAUGH]  "Sorry".  
L:  Well, leave it at home.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Don't bring 'em to school or at least make sure I don't see it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah, I guess they got really good at -- at my daughter's school at -- at hiding 'em.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause she's always talking about they brought this and that and ...  I said, "+I thought at the beginning of the year they got sent home notices, don't let your kids bring 'em to school" and apparently they didn't -- [LAUGH] they hi- -- find ways to hide 'em.
R:  I think sometimes they sneak 'em +from -- from their parents.  They don't know.  I've taken some sometimes.  "Can I have it back".  I say, " [MN] When you mom comes in and gets it".  "But I'm not going to tell her I brought it to school".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That -- they just sneak 'em right by.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Sounds like a kid  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  So do -- do you teach at a year round school or is it a traditional?
R:  It's a traditional but this year we have extended school year.  So we're in school until, uh, the end of June.  
L:  I'm wishing they'd go back to that.  I am --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so tired of year [LAUGH] round.  
R:  Well, this is the last year we're doing it.  And we were supposed to go until July but they ran out of money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, no.  
R:  [inaudible] gone through June.  Yeah, and then we-- they start back up August eighth, I think.  Kids come back.  
L:  Yeah.  To top it off they get -- they put bo- -- each kid on a different track so I have two -- two different tracks --  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to figure out.  And [LAUGH] they're never off at the same time.  
R:  I think they try to get
