L:  Hi.
R:  Hello.
L:  [LAUGH]  Hi.  I'm --
R:  Hi.
L:  -- Jeannie.
R:  Jeannie?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Hi.  I'm Vicky.  I'm in Texas.  Where are you?
L:  I'm in Syracuse, New York.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, my gosh.  You're far away.  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's far.  Yeah.  Where in Texas?
R:  Um, in the panhandle.  By Amarillo. 
L:  All right.  I visited Houston once.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh.  
L:  But ...
R:  [LAUGH]  So what are your hobbies?
L:  Well, um, hobbies are raising kids and going to soccer games and, you know, chauffeuring.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I used to have those hobbies.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]  Those hobbies ha- -- are like a lot of responsibility.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take up a lot of time.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I have a lot of hobbies.  I show dogs and train them.
L:  Wow.
R:  And I paint.  And --
L:  That's great.
R:  -- I do a lot of things.  [LAUGH]  I like to paint and draw. 
L:  So your kids are grown?
R:  Yeah.  I have more time for my hobbies now.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm -- I'm looking forward to that [LAUGH] stage of life.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I used to sew.
R:  It's pretty sweet.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I even play the piano.  
R:  Oh, you play the piano?
L:  I do.  
R:  Great.
L:  I do.  And, uh, actually just recently the -- my kids took it for a while and then they've both given it up in favor of sports.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  And so it sits there.  And I pass it all the time, so every once in a while I actually sit down.  Because it is rather relaxing and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  I would like to have more time to -- to do those kinds of things.  
R:  Right.  
L:  So ...
R:  Well, my dad's a musician.  You probably hear him practising in the background.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He's retired but he still practices his trumpet every day.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I live --
L:  Oh, wow --
R:  -- with him right now.
L:  -- that's great.
R:  I'm separated and -- from my husband so ...  Anyway, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well I spend quite a bit of time and money on my [LAUGH] hobbies.
L:  Yes.  Yeah.  Money -- money is ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  [MN]  When I have it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Right.  
R:  Showing dogs.  People always ask me, "Oh, is there money in that?"  And I'm always, like, "Yeah, I spend a fortune" and there's [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there's plenty of money for someone [LAUGH] to make.
L:  Right.  Well, that's like I know a lot of -- a lot of people are really into this creative memory scrapbooking.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they -- like this one friend, she's incredibly busy but creative memories just hooked her and --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- she spends money and time.  She'll go for those -- they have scrapbooking, um, events, like all day from ten to six --
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's what she'll sign up for because otherwise she won't do it.  
R:  Oh. 
L:  Um, so she's spending the money.  She's spending the time away from her family [COUGH] making these lovely scrapbooks.
R:  Wow. 
L:  Um, so ...
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  But --
R:  -- travel a lot showing dogs.  In fact this weekend I'm gong to Oklahoma to a dog show and ...
L:  Right.  Well, see we're going to Philadelphia for a soccer tournament.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I remember those days.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, my son played soccer.  He was a -- quite an accomplished soccer player.  In fact he still plays on a men's league.
L:  Wow.  That's great.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, my daughter's on a travel team so that really does take some time.
R:  Right.  Oh, I know.
L:  But, you know, you really kind of get used to it and it's like, well, what else would we do on a weekend?  [LAUGH]  You know --
R:  I know.
L:  -- we could garden.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know what you mean.
L:  We could take care of the house.
R:  I really do.  
L:  But ...
R:  Does -- does she play, um, indoor or outdoor, both?
L:  Both.  Both.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  She's on a --
R:  My [MN] yeah -- my son did too.  
L:  Yeah.  They won, uh -- her team won state cup last year.
R:  Oh, fabulous.  Wow.
L:  So that's coming up in two weeks so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's really busy.
L:  They -- they don't think they're going to win it this year +though.  But ...
R:  You never know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Anyways ...  My husband once said, um, there was one time when I was gone doing something with my daughter and my son was, I don't know, at a friend's house, and he actually had nothing to do that weekend or that afternoon.  He goes, "Oh, I have free time.  I should have a hobby".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then he said, "Oh, well, if this is the only time that the time comes around that I can have a hobby maybe it wouldn't be worth the [LAUGH] developing of it.  
R:  Yeah.  I like to fish a lot.  
L:  Really?
R:  Mm.  Yeah, big fisherman.  I like to fly fish and I like -- that's my favorite, is going to the mountains and fishing the streams.
L:  Now I could -- see I could go to the mountains.  That'd be great.  Or the ocean.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  Camping -- camping's a great hobby.
L:  Yeah.  Now we, uh -- for our honeymoon we went, um, to Little Lake in Quebec.  And --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- we went out in a canoe [LAUGH] --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and he fished and I read.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  
L:  But very quiet, very peaceful.
R:  Bet that was beautiful.  
L:  So ...  To me that's what the benefits of hobbies are.  They just kind of take the -- the pressure down.
R:  Well, they do.  I think hobbies are very important.  I don't know what I would do without mine and -- you know, I mean, the -- [MN] the whole dog show thing is like [MN] it's like a whole 'nother -- it's like a whole 'nother world.  I mean, you know, people who show dogs and stuff, they're crazy and --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- you know, if you've ever seen Westminster [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]  Uh, a little bit, yeah.
R:  Or Best in Show, that movie, you know?  It's not really that far off.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  People are, you know, we're just really into it.  Okay.
L:  Great.  Well, but you have to be, you know, so ...
R:  Yeah, well, it's -- to me it's therapeutic.  Because you're there and that's all you're thinking about. 
L:  Right.
R:  I mean, you know, you're just like in that little world and --
L:  You don't have to answer the phone.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know.  Yeah.  You know.  And, you're --
L:  You don't have to do the bills.
R:  You get a little vacation.  
L:  Clean the house.
R:  Yeah.  Stay in a motel for the weekend.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  And meet people -- meet people who have the same interests as you and ...
L:  Right.
R:  I don't know.  It's, [MN] I -- I think it's real important and it's -- you know, it can be a real -- it -- it can also build your self esteem.  Like, because what I'm going through right now is really bad.  You know, divorce and everything but, you know, hey, I've got the number four Norfolk Terrier in the country.  [LAUGH]  You know --
L:  All right.
R:  -- so that's a real nice balance.
L:  Well, yeah, 'cause it --it gives you another persona to, you know, build things around.  Other than just --
R:  Yeah, something positive.
L:  -- you know, you were his wife.  Oh, well.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, because, you know, like, the people who -- who I interact with through my hobbies and stuff, they all know who I am.
L:  Right.
R:  And, you know, and everything and it's the [MN] --
L:  And it's based on your skills and abilities not --
R:  Yeah.  They're supportive. 
L:  You know.
R:  And, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's like, "Oh, there's -- here's something I'm good at.  Wow".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's nice.  That's really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nice.
R:  I think it -- I think they are important on several le- -- on a lot of levels.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  I really do.  You can get you some more hobbies.  That's it, Jeannie.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Go fishing --
L:  Well, I've --
R:  -- next time.
L:  I'm sure I'll find something to keep me busy, you know, like between -- I used to coach my daughter's soccer team and --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- I -- now I teach her --
R:  -- well, that counts.
L:  -- confirmation class.  And I also went back to school so ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  I -- I [MN] do keep busy.  That's important so I ...
R:  You bet.  
L:  Um.
R:  You bet.  You'd love fishing though.  
L:  You think?
R:  Oh, yeah.  Fishing is just --
L:  Well, I wouldn't mind --
R:  -- great.
L:  I wouldn't mind the, you know, throw- -- casting out, you -- I don't -- I don't need to catch any though.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, no that's the g- -- it's great.  Go trout fishing.
L:  [LAUGH]  I caught a catfish once when I was twelve.  [LAUGH] 
R:  All right.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I'm like --
R:  Way to go Jeannie. 
L:  -- ew [LAUGH] .
R:  [LAUGH]  [several inaudible words], yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, my great fishing expedition.
R:  Really.
L:  But ...
R:  Well, I don't u- -- I usually catch and release and [MN] I keep enough, you know, for us to eat when we're camping but, you know, that's -- it's just the whole experience is really neat.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, just being out on the water.  
R:  And being -- yeah, being out on the lake or the, you know --
L:  Yeah.  As long as it's a good day.  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- walk in the streams.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't need to fish in the rain.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So ...  Yeah.
R:  Oh, man.  Well, what's the weather like in New York?
L:  Well, the last two days have been great.  It's been, uh, [LAUGH] seventy nine degrees.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And, uh, we set out to take my daughter to soccer practice at six o'clock and, you know, the wind is just kind a kicking up.  And my daughter says, "Well, it's supposed to rain tomorrow" and I'm like, "I'm not sure we have to wait that long".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Gosh.  
L:  So ...
R:  [MN]
L:  Yes.  She was reading the paper this morning and -- and noticed that, uh, not only did we have more snow than any other city, we also seemed to be right up there in rain.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow. 
L:  Yeah, so ...
R:  Oh, we need rain.  We're not getting a lot of rain.  We're just getting, like, tornadoes all around us.
L:  Oh, I know.
R:  That's [inaudible] and --
L:  I know.
R:  -- the wind blow -- here the wind blows constantly.  It's really awful in the panhandle.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, Chicago's got nothing on -- on us --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- okay?  It's -- it howls.
L:  Well, I -- that's why I live in New York.  You know, we get snowstorms but every -- in Syracuse they know how to handle snowstorms.  They salt --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- the roads, [LAUGH] clear 'em.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  We're fine.  But, you know, there's nothing you can do for a tornado or hurricane.  Any of those things so ...
R:  Oh, well, I know.  
L:  I'm like I'll stay above those.
R:  The tornadoes are scary.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]  They really are.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  But, I don't know, I guess -- I must spend a lot of time on my hobbies and -- that's -- of course I sell some of my artwork so that, you know --
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  -- that's kind of nice.  [LAUGH]  [several inaudible words].
L:  Turning your hobby into your vocation.  That's [inaudible].
R:  Yeah, like a little bit of money.
L:  That's the best.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That helps a lot and I --
L:  Yeah.  At least it helps you break even.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Exactly.  That's it.  That's it.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  I do a lot of portraits for people and other dogs so [MN] --
L:  Wow.
R:  -- my two hobbies combined make me a little bit of money.  They help me support, you know, my dog show habit.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that's great.  That's great.
R:  Well, you know, I mean, it's really crazy though because, you know, how many people spend, you know, like fifty dollars on, you know, [MN] brushes and combs and grooming [LAUGH] supplies --
L:  I [inaudible] -- I [inaudible]. 
R:  -- [LAUGH] for their dog.
L:  Yeah, well you know, I saw --
R:  My dad was making fun of me the other day for grooming.  I was grooming on my dogs.  I have a carrier and you have to hand strip them and [LAUGH] I have all these tools and everything you know.  He weighs ten pounds and I've been out there, like, an hour, you [LAUGH] know.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  He goes, "Yeah, that must be the best groomed dog in the [LAUGH] America".
L:  I know.  She's probably better groomed than my daughter, and all.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm [inaudible] to brush my daughter's hair once a week now.
R:  [LAUGH]  At least you don't pull it out, you know.  [LAUGH] That's --
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  And strip her and ... 
L:  But ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But I really do --
R:  Strip it out.
L:  -- think it's -- it's important that, you know, like I at least have these hobbies on the horizon [LAUGH], that when life settles down a little I'll be able to pick them up because --
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know what you mean.
L:  Otherwise I think people can get really lonely and really, like, you know, what's the purpose in life?  And -- and stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Whereas if, you know, if we have a hobby that kind of, you know, goes --
R:  And then to fall back on.
L:  -- from interaction and some quiet time.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  I think that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really is helpful.
R:  That's right.  That's really, you know, that's true and -- and I can totally relate to you though because
