R:  [NOISE]
L:  Hi, this is Anne.
R:  Hi, Anne.  My name is Grace.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine thanks.  How 'bout you?
L:  Good.
R:  What are your hobbies?
L:  Um, I think right now basically my daughter.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I spend all my time trying to take care of her.
R:  Well, children are very time consuming.
L:  Yes.
R:  I know because I have two.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you have any other hobbies?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, I like bowling.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Bowling?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I like bowling too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I like to enter sweepstakes.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I would say, um, that's one of my hobbies and also, um, entering, you know, contests and -- and doing refunds.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I find that to be a lotta fun and it's very rewarding and, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I do that a couple of hours a week I would say.  But, of course, for you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your daughter is probably a fulltime job.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, I work and I'm going to school right now.  So, any time I have is basically for her.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh, how often do you go bowling?
L:  I try to like once a week to get out.
R:  Oh, that's pretty good.  [NOISE]
L:  And, um, the rest of time is with her.  So ...
R:  I like to bowl, but I don't -- I mean, I have my own ball and everything, but I don't do it very often.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I'm not good at it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, you're not very good?  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm not really too bad.  It's just something to do to get outta the house.
R:  That's the thing it's kinda fun.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Now, is your daughter old enough to bowl with you?
L:  Oh, no, she's only sixteen months.  So ...
R:  Oh, well, no, she's just like a mini bowler then.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Maybe you should get her her own little bowling shoes and her own little bowling bag.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That'd be really cute.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you -- do you do anything else for hobbies?
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], I like to like go play miniature golf and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- shopping.  [LAUGH]  My daughter loves to shop.  So, that's what I do with her most of the time is take her shopping.
R:  Yeah.  When they're little like that they're kinda fun to take out but, uh, uh, as long as they don't grab everything off the shelves.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  She's not gotten into that yet.  So ...
R:  Well, when my daughter was that age she used to run into stores and try -- and try to put on high heels.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It was really hilarious, you know, when she like one and a half or two.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm not too sure if the stores were too thrilled, but she thought it was funny.  You know how they like to try on shoes?
L:  Yeah.  Oh, she loves to play dress up, hats and shoes and -- but ...
R:  [MN] Well, you probably don't have time for any other hobbies other than your once a week bowling and raising your daughter.
L:  Yeah, that's pretty much it right now.
R:  It's very time consuming.
L:  And school and work.
R:  As you said, you go to school as well.
L:  Yes.  So, tell me --
R:  Well, do you have any questions?  [LAUGH]
L:  -- do you spend a lotta time doing sweepstakes?
R:  Oh, yeah, I love to enter sweepstakes.  I just won, um, a hundred dollar gift certificate to Ticket Master today --
L:  Did ya?
R:  -- from, uh, Twix dot com online contest.
L:  Really?  Do you ...?
R:  And that was kinda neat.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Entering the codes that are off the candy bars --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I was happy because, um, you know, I had -- I had won a couple of candy bars doing it for like the past week.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But when I saw that I won a hundred dollar Ticket Master contest, uh -- I mean, the gift certificate I thought that's a pretty good one, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that is.  [LAUGH]
R:  Especially as expensive as concerts are.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Maybe I'll use it to see Mariah Carey this summer.  That'd be kinda neat.
L:  So, have you won a lotta things?  Is it something you do a lot?
R:  Yeah, I've won a lotta things.  I don't usually win really big things, you know, like cars and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I've -- I've won, um, you know, various sums of money --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK], uh, lots of small things like, um, you know, videos, DVDs, um ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Recently I won the Lord of the Rings D.V.D. set, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- various tee shirts, um, let me think.  What else have I won?  Of course, like I said, the gift certificate to Ticket Master.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, yeah, just kind of all assorted things, you know, household stuff.
L:  Well, that's great.
R:  Yeah, it's fun.  Well, it's kinda fun because the -- the money I spend entering if I -- you know, if I use to stamps or the time I spend online I figure, um, you know, it's not like I'm putting a lot into it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's kinda neat knowing I might get something back.
L:  Yeah. That's ...
R:  Because if you don't enter you can't win.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I enjoy that.  It's -- it's kinda neat when something just shows up on my doorstep and I think oh, what's that?
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I must've won something, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that is nice.
R:  Everyone always teases me, what did you win now, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  "Did you win that on one of your contests?"  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But now that you mentioned bowling as a hobby that reminds me I haven't been bowling in several months.
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  And I have- -- in fact -- in fact, that's one of the prizes that I won.  I won a bowling ball about ...
L:  Did ya?
R:  Um, yeah, about three years ago.  A really nice one and it was weird.  It just showed up.  Apparently I had entered a contest through, um [LIPSMACK] -- I'm -- I'm thinking it's called A.M.C., uh, bowling centers, something like that.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And this ball shows up and, of course, it's not drilled, you know, 'cause they have to fit your hand --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and then I had a letter saying to go to, um, any bowling center that is affiliated with this bowling company --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I did that and they drilled it, and it had a case and everything, and --
L:  That's nice.
R:  -- even the guy -- even the guy in the bowling center who drilled it said, "This is a really nice bowling ball.  Where did ya get it?"
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.
R:  And so I had the story behind that on how I won it, you know?  [LAUGH]  That was kinda neat.
L:  That is.
R:  Yeah.  In fact, I forgot about that until you mentioned bowling.  And since we're on the telephone I've won a telephone a couple of times.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's just ...
L:  You do that a lot pretty much over the time?
R:  Well, I figure one of these days I have to win something really huge like a car or a trip or something like that, you know?
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Oh, I did win a trip to Mexico once.
L:  Did ya?
R:  Several years ago.
L:  Did ya end up going?
R:  Uh, the -- the one in Mexico I sold it to someone.
L:  Oh, did you?
R:  Uh, yeah.  Uh, I sold it to a friend of mine who was a, um -- a policeman --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, uh -- 'cause I couldn't take it because I was on a, um -- I was on a, um -- getting ready to move at the time.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I needed someone to buy it.  But I -- that was pretty good 'cause I needed the money at the time.
L:  Yeah, to help with your moving.  That's the other thing I like to do is travel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's a hobby.  I'm planning two road trips right now.  So ...
R:  And -- and where are you going to go?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, I'm going to New Jersey --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I'm going to go to Charleston.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, that'll be -- that'll be pretty.  Eckerd, Charleston is very pretty.
L:  I love Charleston.  I went there once about three years ago and I just loved it.  So --
R:  [MN] That sounds neat.
L:  -- I'd like to go back up there.
R:  Great.
L:  [NOISE] And there's a -- an exemplary union in New Jersey.  So, my sister and I are gonna drive up there.  So ...
R:  Is that a long drive for you?
L:  I'm in Florida.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, goodness!
L:  It'll be -- it'll be a long ride.
R:  That's a long way.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, you can add, um -- you can add long, uh, car rides to your hobbies.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  But I like road trips.  I'd prefer that over flying kinda.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, it can be the more convenient because then you don't have to worry about renting a car and you don't have to worry about --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- the time involved in the, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- airport delays, you know?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...  I drove up to Chicago about two years ago and I loved it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just the whole ride, it was nice.  So, I thought it would be nice to do it again.
R:  I've been on some pretty long car rides.
L:  Yeah.  That took quite a while.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  They're kinda neat though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I've been -- I've gone across country a couple of times and, uh, that's not for the faint of heart [LAUGH] I m- -- I might add.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It seems like you go through all these different climates on the way, you know, really, really hot --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- in certain areas, you know, and really, really dry in other areas --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- really, really flat in other areas.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And it seems like a lotta the country it looks the same.  I mean, the United States is huge --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it seems like a lot of it is kind of similar.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I mean, like the area in the middle is kind of all the same.
L:  Yeah.  I like to go through Tennessee, you go through the mountains and everything and --
R:  Oh, that's pretty.  Yeah. 
L:  -- take that route.
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's real pretty up there.  So -- so, do you have any other hobbies?
R:  Ah, I like to read a lot, uh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- go to the movies a lot too.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I love to go to the movies.  I do like that every -- at least once a week.
L:  How old are your kids?
R:  Uh, my daughter just turned eighteen and my son is almost fifteen.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh.
R:  So, they -- they were quite a handful when they were small.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  [NOISE] I wonder if our ten minutes is up yet.  I haven't heard the little beep sound.
L:  No, I haven't heard anything yet.  It should be about up.
R:  I can hear your little daughter babbling in the background.
L:  Have you been doing this much?  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, this is only my second time.  It's kinda neat.  [LAUGH]
L:  This is my first time.  So ...
R:  How did you hear about it?
L:  My Mom.  She -- actually she does a lotta stuff on the computer too --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- as far as like she's in some coupon club and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- different things like that and she does sweepstakes and stuff too and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- she came across this about a week or two ago and told me about it.  So, she signed me up for it and ...
R:  Oh.  What state does she live in?
L:  She lives pretty close to me.
R:  So, she's in Florida too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I heard about it, uh, also through one of my little clubs and, um, I didn't really pay a lot of attention at first, but then a lady that I know kinda well on there emailed me about it and I thought well, if she's in it it's gotta be legitimate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and somebody said, you know, it was really fun.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I tried it and I thought it's kinda neat.  I mean, I never heard of it.  It -- it sounds bizarre when you first hear about it.
L:  It does.
R:  I thought, you know -- I thought it was some kind of a [LIPSMACK] -- I thought it was gonna be like a survey --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is what I was expecting.
L:  I never really did find out why they did it.  Do you know why?
R:  No, I -- I really don't.
L:  What their purpose is?  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  All I know is it's legitimate and I know --
L:  Uh-huh.
