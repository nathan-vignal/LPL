R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, work for a hospice and I got laid off and I had --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- gotten my real estate licence, but I think I'm gonna have to still go get another job which is --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- almost impossible now here.  But, um ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  But I just came in.  I was -- I was planting some plants I bought.  I love to work in the yard and I have an +herb garden and stuff like that.
R:  Oh, see and I would love it.  We have -- we put in, like, just tomatoes and cucumbers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- in the summer because we have such a short growing period.
L:  Yeah.  If you ever --
R:  I mean --
L:  -- want to move down to Florida I know a good realtor.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  No, I'm going to stay in Montana.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  I like the mountains.  We go to the mountains a lot but ...
L:  Yeah, that's good.  I have --
R:  One of our --
L:  -- relatives in California and I love it out there.  
R:  Do ya?
L:  We -- yeah.
R:  See I've never been to California.  I've never been to Florida either so ...
L:  Oh.  If you ever come down, um, I live in Citrus County.  I- it's -- it's, uh, it's not too bad.  You know.  [MN] But you need to come down in the winter.  In the summer it's hot.  
R:  Oh, yeah, I bet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I bet it is.  We were thinking about going down taking a cruise in October but I don't --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- know if that's gonna pan out.  I think we're gonna be too busy to do that this year but ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  I would like to.  
L:  Yeah.  [several inaudible words]  Yeah.
R:  But ...  So ...  So real estate huh?  Well, that's something I could--
L:  I'm trying anyway.  I sold one house.  I'm been doing it since November [MN] full time so I don't know.  [MN]  I don't think it's --
R:  Yeah, well, don't give up.
L:  Oh, I don't ever give up but I --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- I need -- I need to go get a job [LAUGH] though 'cause my unemployment's gonna run out.
R:  Yeah.  Um, you worked for a hospice, huh?
L:  I used to.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I got laid off but, um, yeah, this particular hospice is that is not such a great one to work for so --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I applied down in, um, Marion County, which I know some people and my old boss works there so I may --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- have an in.  So they're opening a -- a new house in, um, [LIPSMACK] oh [MN] end of September so I may get the job. 
R:  Oh, great.
L:  This isn't about hobbies.  We're supposed to be talking [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Well, that's -- life is hobbies too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, how 'bout kids?  You got kids?
L:  No, just the dog.  Uh --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  A husband and a dog.  [LAUGH] 
R:  A husband and a dog.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Dogs, like, you know, and I guess that runs in to hobby too.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [inaudible] they are --
L:  She's --
R:  -- part of the family and --
L:  She's a spoiled --
R:  -- and uh --
L:  -- brat.
R:  Yeah.  I had a German Shepherd I had to put down last year.  She had cancer and I'm still looking for the right dog so ...
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's how -- we got her from the pound.  Somebody had --
R:  Yeah. 
L:  -- beaten the living daylights out of her and stuff.  So we have her --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- eight years.  
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, she's a --
R:  Yeah, see --
L:  -- smart little dog.  
R:  I picked one out that I was going to take him camping and everything.  'Cause this guy was abusing him and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- he was a Golden Retriever.  Beautiful dog, but --
L:  Oh, they're gorgeous.
R:  He was so great.  I've got three boys and, um, they're thirteen, fifteen and eighteen and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- then I have a little six year old.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so he just did not get along with my husband and the boys.  I mean, it -- it was so sad.  I mean, but I found a beautiful home for him and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- he's doing great.  
L:  That's hard when they don't get along.  Um ...
R:  Yeah.  Well, and that's why -- that was my decision to give him up because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, he was a beautiful dog and registered and -- and -- but if he's not going to get along with the family then there's no reason to have the dog.  [several inaudible words].
L:  [MN] I think when get mistreated.  Took a while for my dog to get used to my husband because a man had mistreated her and not a woman.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that had -- it took about a year.
R:  Yeah.  See and -- and --
L:  Ashby[?]
R:  -- we had him for probably six months.
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  And -- and I gave him to a couple who are going to get married pretty soon.  And --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- he's got a nice yard and a -- and a nice home and --
L:  Good.
R:  And so I'm real happy with that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, do you, um, go fishing?
L:  I used to.  Don't anymore.  We, um, we used to live on a lake and we used to fish.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  I used to love it.  Go out on the boat and I'm --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- originally from Long Island so I -- I used to go out on the sail boat and, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  [LIPSMACK]  We used to own a motor boat.
R:  Have you ever been to Montana?
L:  Uh, probably I've been through it.  Not -- not, you know -- I haven't stopped --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- there.  I probably been over it a few times.  Going to --
R:  Got a lot of --
L:  -- San Francisco and ...
R:  -- things to do here.  Lot of things to do.
L:  The only thing is it's so cold.  'Cause we're looking --
R:  It is.  I'll tell you [LAUGH] why.  We had frost on the windows this morning.  Like I --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- said we have a certain growing season as --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- far as gardening and -- and -- goes.  I haven't --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- planted my plants yet.  Usually I get 'em in before Memorial Day but it's been a weird year.
L:  Yeah.  My husband ordered some tomato plants and he hasn't gotten 'em yet but last year I couldn't -- the only thing I could get to grow was peppers and a few --
R:  Really?
L:  -- tomatoes.  I couldn't get -- I had zucchini which grows like weeds.  I couldn't get them to grow.  And I couldn't get anything, um, like my eggplant.  I couldn't get to grow.  So I don't know.
R:  Wow. 
L:  But we're only living in this house two years and, um, where we lived before it, um, down south more, uh, things grew a little better.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But for some reason up here it get -- I don't know.  Even our orange tree's getting a second bloom because the first bloom, the frost got it, you know.  
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, we're like on the bottom of a hill but, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I just love flowers.  My uncle was a landscaper so that's one of my favorite things to do.  
R:  Is your flower garden?
L:  Yeah.  And I have a +herb garden in the front.  
R:  Oh, see --
L:  And, uh, people stop and [LAUGH] 
R:  I would --
L:  You too?
R:  Oh, no, I would love to have one.  I just -- we have such a gr- -- a short growing season I don't know where I'd put it.  I'd like to have a big bay window with herbs and ...
L:  Yeah, you can do that.  
R:  [several inaudible words] that.
L:  They grow good in ...  I have it out front and, um, the nurses -- [MN] I still keep in touch with nurses from hospice and a couple of the, um, bereavement counsellors and one of [LAUGH] 'em always comes over, "Can I have some +herbs?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] Can I have some?
L:  And a couple of the realtors I bring 'em in for and stuff so ...  But, um ...
R:  Oh.
L:  I use --
R:  That's pretty neat.
L:  -- them a lot in my cooking so ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But we're on --  
R:  Do you --
L:  Yeah.
R:  Do you like to cook?
L:  I love to cook.  
R:  See, that's one of my big things too.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is I love to cook.
L:  I'm Italian.  [LAUGH]  I bake all --
R:  Are ya?
L:  Yeah.  All --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- Italians like to cook. 
R:  Yeah, I just, you know, I just started to cook and, uh, like about, oh, ten years ago and I mean, I -- I pull recipes off the internet.  I sit there and go through.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have some real old ones.  Um, years ago when I lived up in north I worked for Roman Aerospace and we used to do, like, one day a week everybody bring in a recipe.  You'd make a --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- recipe and you bring in the recipe and then what you do is you -- you -- you just switch the recipes around.  Everybody got a copy.  And, um, everybody got to taste what it is.  So if you like it, you know, you had the recipe for it.
R:  Wow, that sounds like fun.
L:  Yeah, that worked pretty good.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um, I'm not a good --
R:  And throw it --
L:  -- baker.
R:  -- away if you don't like it.  I'm not either.  I cook real meals.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I can't -- I can't bake.  I tr- -- everytime I try.  I've been trying all these apple things because my husband should eat apples, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Everytime I try an apple dessert it's -- it's a failure.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh-huh.  
L:  I don't know why.  Yet I can put together a meal, a real complicated meal, and -- and -- then it's fine.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But, um ...
R:  I -- I think it's therapy though in the kitchen.
L:  Yeah.  I, um, I can cook by -- well, I cook by touchy feely and my grandmother, uh, she taught me how to make pizza and bread and stuff.
R:  I'm on the phone, inside.  Inside until I'm done Brie[?] and I am not kidding.  [NOISE]  That's my other -- that's my other --
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  In.  Hobby.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Your other hobby?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, my hobby's laying at the feet over here.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Um, no, she'll come out and talk my ear off, so ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  She's only six.  
L:  Oh.  That's a cute ...  
R:  But ...  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, she's cute.  Three boys and then I had one girl, so ...  She's cute.
L:  [MN]
R:  But, you know, we grew up in -- I grew up here in Billings, Montana.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- which is the largest city in Montana and there's probably a population of m- maybe ninety thousand.
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  Which is the largest city and -- and that's why I could never move anywhere.  The traffic would drive me nuts.  It would drive me absolutely nuts.  I could --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- never move.  We go to Denver once in a while.  And, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it drives me crazy.  
L:  Yeah, see we --
R:  But ...
L:  We come from, um, [LIPSMACK] -- well, I come from New York but we -- we moved up and I met my husband here, he's from Baltimore.  And --
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  -- and we keep going for -- [MN] [LAUGH] we moved up north from down south because it keeps getting crowded and people keep following us up.  He says --
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  "Everywhere we go it gets +crowded".  So we -- [LAUGH] we started down in, um, Hillsborough County, moved to Marion, now we're in Citrus, and there's not too much further up north we can go.  But, um ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, so do you like, um
