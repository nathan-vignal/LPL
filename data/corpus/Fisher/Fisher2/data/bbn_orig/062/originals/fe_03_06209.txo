L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.
R:  I'm Marianne [inaudible] from Austin, Texas.
L:  Oh hi, I'm Yvonne Swinson from Virginia.
R:  Hi, how ya doing?
L:  Hi.  Have you done this before?
R:  Um, you can go ahead f- -- go ahead first.
L:  Oh, okay. [LAUGH]  I --
R:  They said, uh, their favorite hobbies?
L:  Yes, um, actually my favorite hobby is right now I'm -- I do a lotta scrapbooking and photography.
R:  Oh really?
L:  I have three small children and, um, try to do a lot of scrapbooking for each of them and taking --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  -- pictures and what have you.
R:  A lot of people are i- -- are into scrapbooking, from what I hear.  I never tried it +myself, you know, I guess I just, uh, don't you have to have the patience for that, too?
L:  Um, I do- -- I guess --
R:  Or --
L:  -- you have to enjoy the creativity.
R:  Yes, you do.
L:  Um, and -- and a lotta people I know don't get into it because they have a hard time keeping up with the --
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  -- pictures.
R:  And, um, well, my hobby is, uh, refunding and couponing.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Oh yeah.  Do you, uh, do you usually do -- do you any of that?
L:  I don't.
R:  You don't?
L:  I --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I actually -- I -- I usually am careful about buying the off brands but I've never gotten into couponing at all.
R:  Oh really?  Okay.
L:  Right.
R:  It's a -- it's a real profiterive[?] -- pro- profitable hobby and it saves a lotta money and I've been doing it for a long time, like, over twenty years.
L:  Really?
R:  And, uh, I subscribe to a re- -- to refund magazines too and, uh, they -- I learn a lot too, from those magazines, and -- and I also go to their websites online so I learn a lot every day from different people, you know, and just from different refunders, you know, and people, couponers that -- that save money, you know.
L:  Right.  Do you, um --
R:  And they're always -- they're always --
L:  Does that take a lotta time?
R:  Uh, yes it does but it, uh, uh, you can more or less, uh, schedule it, you know, around your other --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- activities, you know.  Or your ho- --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, house duties and -- and, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  It does --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- uh, it is a -- but it -- in the long run it is rewarding.
L:  Right.
R:  And it's a -- and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and saves you a lotta money on your budget --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- on your household budget, so --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I would recommend it to anyone, if you wanna save money.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  And you will notice a change when you start using it.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  You know.  You start saving money or --
L:  Huh.  I guess I always felt overwhelmed when I went through the little cou- coupon things that come with the paper and stuff like that.
R:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
L:  It just seems like there's so many to -- to weed through to get to a [NOISE] brand I use --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- or something.  I can't imagine finding that enjoyable. [LAUGH]
R:  It just -- in a way it does take time to, uh, clip coupons.
L:  Right.
R:  But, you know, you could do it like, uh, every now and then you get -- you get a chance, you know, like when you're, uh, like at nighttime or during the day when you have the kids at, you know, sleep or --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- or during school or something, you know, you get a chance to clipping 'em.  But, uh, I been doing it for a long time and it does save me a lotta money.
L:  Huh.
R:  And I wouldn't -- I wouldn't do without it.
L:  Well that's, you know, it's interesting you bring up while they're at school because another, uh, I don't know if you really call it a hobby or not, but one of the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- things I really like to -- I'm involved in home schooling.
R:  What's that?
L:  And -- I'm involved in home schooling.
R:  Oh, home schooling, okay.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]  So I -- I teach my own children at home and, um --
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's pretty good too.
L:  -- I did that with my brother in law as well, when he was finishing up high school I home --
R:  Is that hard doing that?
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I mean, uh, I always wonder if -- if it's harder on you to do it yourself or ...?
L:  Um, in some ways it is, it's a discipline issue, you have to really be motivated to stick to a schedule and, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's easy to let little things [NOISE], um, get in the way of your daily routine with educating them and what have you.  But it's so rewarding --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to see how advanced they are and how quickly they get through the same amount of work that their peers do in a whole day of school and that sort of thing and it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it leaves us open to taking, you know, family vacations when other families --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- aren't vacationing and --
R:  That's true.
L:  -- [NOISE] um, things like that, so --
R:  I +always hear about people do --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that do that, [inaudible], uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Like, I talk this to other people --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- online and there's some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- people that do that, they don't -- they home school --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- their kids, so --
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  -- I was just wondering how, you know, it was to -- how different it was and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you know, if it's harder than -- than the regular school, you know.
L:  Right. [NOISE]
R:  But --
L:  Well, we were just, um, [NOISE] -- I also do -- sign language is a --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- is a hobby of mine and I'm trying to teach my kids sign language now [NOISE] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- as part of their home schooling curriculum. [NOISE]
R:  Um, my daughter took sign language in school.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yes.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Uh, she was in deaf -- deaf, uh, uh, ca- deaf, uh, I guess the subject --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- sign language and, uh, well I guess sign language for the deaf or, you know, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I guess that's what you call it.  But she took it and she li- -- she liked it a lot.  She had a -- a deaf teacher, you know, and she enjoyed it a lot, she -- you know, she liked doing that.  And actually made good grades in it too.  But, uh --
L:  So one -- one of the questions that they ask in a little screening thing is, "How important do you think it is for people to have hobbies?"
L:  [MN]
R:  Uh, you don't l- like, uh, towards the end?
L:  Right.
R:  Well, I guess they just asked if you don't have, uh, what you thought about the s- -- the -- like we're doing right now.
L:  Right.
R:  They got, uh, g- -- they want your feedback on what you thought about it.
L:  Right.
R:  And if you liked it and all that +stuff, and if you enjoyed it.  'Cause, uh, this is my third one I'm doing.  Have you done one already?
L:  I did one earlier.
R:  Oh, okay.  And this is my third one I'm doing and -- and, um, the other subjects I had was, um, sports injuries and [LIPSMACK] -- what was the other one?  On airport security.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  Yeah, so ...
L:  So I guess hobbies is a little easier to talk about then! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, it is. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, but the m- -- that's my main hobby, is couponing and refunding, and I enjoy doing it and I -- I enjoy d- getting all those rebate checks in the mail, 'cause you know, I do every -- every once in a while I'll forget to send some, you know, I just have to get myself motivated to doing it, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  And, um, well, us -- I'm -- I don't work, I stay at home so I, um, and my daughter's the only one in school right now.  In high school and in fact she's gonna graduate in two weeks so --
L:  Wow.
R:  So, you know, that's why I have time to, you know --
L:  To do it.  Right.
R:  -- to do my hobby, you know.  And then, like I said, I've been doing it for a long time so I l- -- I like doing it, you know, it's real enjoyable, plus I learn a lot more from other people, you know, online and -- and through my refund magazines.
L:  Right.
R:  You know.
L:  Huh.
R:  And then I save money too on a lotta stuff.  Not just groceries, you know, and I use coupons for other stuff like clothes and -- and food when you eat out at restaurants, you know.  I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  I even, uh, bought one of the entertainment books --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- through my daughter's school, so I use those coupons from that too, so th- that saves me a lotta money too.  But some of the coupons --
L:  I would imagine it would if you go outlet.
R:  Yeah.  Some of the -- well, some of those coupons --
L:  I -- my husband and I are guess are sort of homebodies.
R:  Yes.
L:  We, uh, [MN] we have a -- a ranch here of sorts and we spend all -- it's, you know, another hobby, is just being outdoors with the animals, we have horses and a big garden --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh --
R:  Whereabouts in Virginia did you say you live in?
L:  It's Louisa, it's between Richmond and Charlottesville.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And, um, we have about forty acres and we just -- we just love the outdoors and being --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the quiet, so we don't go into town much to see --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- movies and go to dinner and things like that and --
R:  Yeah, I live in the city.  I live in Austin, Texas --
L:  Right in Austin.
R:  -- and I live in the city so it's a whole lot different --
L:  I bet.
R:  -- in the city to -- to being out, you know, in the -- in the -- out in the ranch, so I guess it's a different living, kinda living, yeah.
L:  Yeah, I really enjoy outdoor activities so we -- it would be hard for me to live in a big city.  I have, in the past.
R:  You have?  Oh, okay.
L:  Right, but --
R:  And you didn't like it?
L:  I li- -- well, I liked Virginia Beach because I also love going to the beach and boating and sailing and things like that, and Virginia Beach is right on the water --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so that wasn't bad.  But I also lived in Atlanta, Georgia for a while and I wasn't --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- very happy there because, like I said, I just like to do all sorts of outdoor activities --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and stay busy out of doors and it's hard to do in a big city.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Y'all have -- do y'all have horses there too?
L:  I do.  We have a horse and we have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a pony for the girls.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  We spend a lotta time doing that.
R:  Oh, they'd -- they'd love it.
L:  My husband used to be a barrel racer and, um --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- so we spend a lot of time with the horses actually.
R:  That's good.
L:  So ...
R:  And -- what was your name again?
L:  Yvonne.
R:  Yvonne?
L:  Right.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm Marianne.  So, it was nice talking to you and, um, you know, learning about your activities and -- and your hobbies.  Um, do you have anything else?  Any other hobbies besides that, scrapbooking?
L:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well --
R:  Um, this is mainly my hobby.
L:  A lot of small hob- -- I -- I used to do gymnastics for a really long time, I spent about fifteen years competing in gymnastics.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so that's still a little bit of a hobby for me but I don't --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't actually do the gymnastics anymore, I just teach it now to my daughter.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I work at the YMCA --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and um, and so I go there and teach gymnastics classes and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- so I guess you could kinda count that as a hobby too.
R:  Yeah, it is, like a part time hobby.
L:  Even if I get paid for it! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  It's like a part time hobby, you know.
L:  Right, right.
R:  Something you enjoy doing.  And, uh, let's see, what else could it -- could be considered a hobby?  Um, I guess, uh, surf- -- uh, being online surfing the Internet, would that be considered a hobby?
L:  Now that, if that's a hobby, I do a lotta that.
R:  Okay.
L:  I have an -- a group of friends that I -- I email --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- all the time, we're -- we're all part of like, one support group of sorts.  I -- I had several miscarriages after my first daughter and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I got online as part of a support group for that.
R:  Oh.
L:  And I have maintained a lot of those friendships and we have about twenty different girls and I --
R:  Oh, what -- what, uh, what site is this?
L:  It's -- it's a Yahoo group.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That is for women who've had --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- miscarriages and, um, and so yeah, I spend a lot of time on the computer --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- talking to them when -- when I'm not busy with my children I'm --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- able to -- probably an hour or two a day I guess I spend online.
R:  Yeah, um, yes.  That's +enjoyable, and, you know, and trying, you know, just talking to everybody and getting, uh, input and feedback on --
L:  Now, with your couponing and -- and rebates and stuff like that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do you do a lot of that online or is most of that like, stuff you get through the mail or ...?
R:  Uh, I do that, hm, most of, uh, I do that on- online too --
L:  Oh really?
R:  -- through, uh, one of the re- um, [LIPSMACK] [inaudible] well, I've [inaudible] had -- there's two
