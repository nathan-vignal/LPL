L:  Hi.
R:  Hi, my name's Annette.
L:  Hi, Annette.  I'm Cathy.
R:  Hi, Cathy.
L:  How ya doing tonight?
R:  Pretty good.  What are your hobbies?
L:  Well, um [LIPSMACK], I guess my -- the primary thing that I spend my spare time on is kind of part hobby and part mission.  I do, um, uh, rescue work with homeless animals, uh --
R:  Oh, wonderful.
L:  -- dogs and cats and, um, um, spend a lot of spare time doing that.  So much that all the hobbies I used to have, have kind of fallen by the wayside, you know?
R:  I understand.  People are always dumping off cats out here --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause it's kind of a country type area, even though it's part of San Diego County it's out in the country --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LAUGH] and so all these animals find their way to my house.  I guess word has gotten out that I will feed them.  So ...
L:  Well, they know.  They know, um, no doubt about it.  I live in, um, a rural area of Georgia.  Actually I'm just south of Savannah but, um, um, yeah, there's -- there's a lot of agricultural mind set here and -- and animals are considered, uh, highly dispensable I guess and, uh, so the -- the, uh, situation with unwanted animals here is -- is pretty bad.  Um, so it -- it takes up a lot of my time, but I enjoy it and -- and I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile with my time, you know?
R:  Right.  You certainly are, yes.
L:  So, what about yourself, what do you enjoy?
R:  Oh, besides that?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Besides feeding all the animals that come to your house.
R:  Well, I'm a mother -- I'm a mother of three and they're all under ten and one of 'em is only nine months.  So, if I have --
L:  So, you have no time for hobbies.
R:  -- spare time [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] You must be busier than I am then.
R:  If I have spare time I -- I like gardening and I love to read.  Hardly ever get a chance for either but ...  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.  But those are both things that I used to, uh, do quite a lot of but, uh, again -- and I just -- I don't have the time anymore and, uh, um, the gardening here -- the -- the temperature --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- most of the summer is so hot and the humidity is so high that, um, I just -- I can't bear the heat the way I used to, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That's just started happening out here.  When I first moved here -- 'cause I -- I, um -- I'm a native of San Diego --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I had no idea of this section of it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?
R:  It's like more considered desert and so the temperatures most of the summer are -- are a hundred and five plus.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  Last summer it got up to a hundred and eighteen for several days there and --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- I thought I was gonna die.
L:  And I was complaining about our weather.  We don't have anything approaching that.
R:  Yeah.  So, when I first moved out here I was all ambitious 'cause I had all this, you know, big huge yard and I thought oh, I can grow all sorts of vegetables and, you know, eat my own --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- food and --
L:  I did the same thing --
R:  -- the first heat wave came by and they all died.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- the first year I lived here.  Oh, yes.  Bought my -- bought my own little tiller and --
R:  Oh, God!  Yeah.
L:  -- tilled up a little plot and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  One year that lasted.  The tiller has not been out of the garage since then.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh, it was -- it was fun while it lasted I guess and -- and the things that don't require any work I -- I planted a lot of herbs, um, a lot of rosemary and lemon balm and things that are gonna come back year after year after year and you don't have to do anything to 'em.  So, those I still have and that's -- you know, that's pleasant enough.  But I don't even keep them trimmed up the way I should, you know?
R:  So far the only thing that's survived the heat are oleanders and geraniums.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We have plenty of -- of both of those down here too.  Um, what do you like to read?
R:  Well, um, mostly I like to -- if I get a chance to read [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, I like to read like self improvement type material --
L:  Right.
R:  -- whether -- you know, whether it's working on improving your inner self or whether it's learning how to build something or home improvement.  I mean, just like learning how to do something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that applies to real life.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, what -- what authors do you enjoy as far as like the self improvement kinda thing?
R:  Uh, well, Dr. Phil [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm. 
R:  -- 'cause I enjoy his humor.
L:  Well, I do too.  But I'll tell ya I think he's getting a little pompous since he's gotten his own show.
R:  I don't like the show.  I must say I waited so long for that show ...
L:  He's -- he's just a little over the edge.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, I mean ...
R:  I -- I -- I waited so long for that show and then I just -- I don't like it.  I hardly ever watch it.
L:  Well, I -- I still think he has some valuable things to say and I like that he just comes right out and says them.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, that's true.
L:  But -- but he's -- sometimes I say he's -- he's gotten a little bit pompous.  Everything he says is so overly simplistic and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- life is just not quite like that, you know?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, if you could solve everybody's problems in, you know, a -- a ten minute, um, conversation, uh, you would be worth all that money.  [LAUGH]
R:  I like it when he gives advice to mothers and says, "Well, just get a babysitter and, you know, do this".  It's like okay [LAUGH], are you paying for it?
L:  Yeah, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  And do you live in an area where there are any?  There's hardly any people let alone babysitters, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Let alone somebody you would trust with your child.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  No, it's ...
R:  Like hello, I don't know you, but I'm gonna dump off my nine month old and be gone for several hours [LAUGH] --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and by that time you probably have done the five minute drive across the border into Mexico with my child.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Um, no, he's -- he's a little -- gotten a little bit pompous since he got that show.  But I still like him.  I -- I do and I think he has some fair things to say too.  So, um, who else besides him?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I have a few books by John Gray.  I had gotten the one, um, Children are from Heaven because I have a son with A.D.H.D. --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and that has some helpful tips in it.
L:  Well, that's good.  That's good.  Uh, I've -- I've never read any of his books, although I've borrowed, um, what I guess was a book on tape from a friend several years ago, um, and it was the, uh, Men are Mars.
R:  I've never read that.  You would think I would've r- read one that, but I haven't.
L:  Well -- and, you know, you would think it would be ...
R:  I always wanted to.  [LAUGH]
L:  It -- it was actually one that I thought well, you know, why do I want to -- to read this or listen to it?  But he was just very, very insistent that I should and -- and I did and then I thought okay, yes, well, that still doesn't mean they're not being jack asses.  [LAUGH]
R:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you know?  I mean, everything he says may be true, but it's no excuse.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH] Um, so that was my -- kinda my last experience with him.  But, um [LIPSMACK], I ...
R:  So, what about you?
L:  Well, uh, when I used to have a lotta time to read --
R:  [LAUGH] Exactly.
L:  -- um, I -- I like -- I like to read, uh, good fiction, historical fiction especially, um, love Anne Rice, you know, just as -- as a way to -- to kind of get away from the real world.
R:  Escape, yeah.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], and, um, I like a lot of southern authors, um, most of whom you've probably never heard of un- unless you just particularly like southern literature.  But, um, um, there are a lot of good southern authors who write short stories --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, so I've got a lot of collections of books by like Bailey White and -- and, um, just several different authors who -- who I think are -- are very entertaining, and I like, um [LIPSMACK], I guess what I would call spiritual types of books, um, Sylvia Brown and -- 
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and James van Prague, um --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- I -- I think there are some very -- very talented people, um, who are in the spotlight today, whether it's through their books or television or -- or whatever.
R:  Do you watch Crossing Over?
L:  You know, I usually don't get to because I'm not home when it's on or when it's on in the evenings.  I'm -- I'm long since in bed.  But I have seen it, um, a number of times and I like John Edward a lot.  I've read a couple of his books in fact, um, and, uh, uh, James van Prague I think is -- is really, really talented, um, and -- and I just adore Sylvia Brown.  I mean, I just --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- think she has the most wonderful sense of humor and ...
R:  She really tells it like it is.
L:  Yeah.  She does.  She does.
R:  Dump the guy!  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, she's -- she's Dr. Phil, but without the enormous head, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but, uh, and -- and it's the strangest thing, um, you know, I have a -- a regular day job so I'm very rarely home when Montell is on.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But oddly enough it seems like every time I do have a day off or the afternoon of, for whatever reason, and I come home and I flip the television on she's on Montell.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like I always pick those days, uh, which -- which pleases me very much 'cause I really, really enjoy her.  But I've read a lot of her books and she has a lot of interesting, uh --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- insights to give, you know, and -- and with those kinds of things I kinda take what has the ring of truth and, uh, you know, keep that and -- and let the rest of it go.  Yeah, I don't think, uh, everybody's meant to I guess --
