R:  Yeah.  Definitely.
L:  You know?  I mean, just to keep yourself busy and to keep yourself occupied --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, it's something that keeps your mind going, you know --

L:  -- you don't ever get lazy I guess because you're always thinking about something that you particularly like to do or ...
R:  Yeah.  I mean, something you can just put your energy into it.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You can -- like it's part of you.  You can -- like if nothing else [LAUGH] in your life --

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I didn't know how to play.  But --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- he always -- he was always playing cards.  So --
R:  Nice.

R:  Yeah, that's neat.
L:  [MN] But as far as hours, you know, in a week on my hobbies it -- it will vary from week to week --

R:  [MN]
L:  What do you think are the most, um, uh, thought of hobbies?  You know, when somebody says a hobby, what do you think most people would think of?

R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.

R:  Yeah.  I'm not, uh -- do you like scrap booking?
L:  No, I hate it.  [LAUGH]
R:  I've never been into it either.  I don't understand.
L:  Yeah.  I have a friend of mine who lives in Vegas and, um, she actually has sent me some stuff over the Internet --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that they've started scrap booking online.  [LAUGH]

R:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that ...
R:  Everything's going online.
L:  Oh, my goodness!  Yes.  So, that had to have taken forever to -- to get the site and stuff going.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, you know, if hobbies are going online now good Lord!  [LAUGH]

R:  Yeah.  I think I've played one of those before.
L:  Yeah.
R:  My brother's or something.
L:  Yeah.  That's definitely an interesting turn.
R:  Yeah.  I think it's important for people to have hobbies out like --
