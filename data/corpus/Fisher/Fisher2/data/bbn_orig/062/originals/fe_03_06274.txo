R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  I'm Dee Dee.
R:  Hi, my name's Nancy.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  My name's Nancy.
L:  Nancy.  Okay.  Where ya from, Nancy?
R:  Um, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  I talked to someone in Pennsylvania last time I got a phone call.  I'm from, um, Virginia, Harrisburgh.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Actually I, um -- I'm -- my parents live in Pittsburgh, but I live in Washington D.C. --
L:  Oh, do ya?
R:  -- and I'm in Pittsburgh.  So ...
L:  Okay.  Okay.  My, um -- my husband is from, uh, Alexandria in that area.  So --
R:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- we visit there quite -- quite frequently, quite frequently.  So, we're talking about hobbies today, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  You wanna go first?
R:  Um, sure.  Um, let's see.  I -- I -- I guess lately I haven't had any specific, you know, like kind of gardening, you know, arts and craft, that kind of thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I really like -- one thing I really do like is reading and writing.
L:  Do you really?
R:  Yeah.  Um [LIPSMACK], other things.  Well, yeah, I like reading a lot and, um [LIPSMACK], my sister's very into arts and crafts and so sometimes I get -- sometimes when I'm with her we'll start projects and stuff, um --
L:  Right.  Right.  I got you.  I'm sorry.  My phone -- there we go.
R:  -- and, um ...  [LIPSMACK] That's okay.  Um, and what else?  I also like -- I guess shopping really isn't a hobby though, but [LAUGH] I like ...
L:  Well, that can be a hobby.  [LAUGH]  That could be a hobby.
R:  [LAUGH] But those are -- I guess those are the extent of it.  I mean, I've -- I've always wanted to get involved in something, you know --
L:  Really?
R:  -- that I could put time and effort into, but I haven't really gotten around to doing it, you know, lately?
L:  Are you -- are you looking for a hobby like -- that you can actually like put your hands to something?  You know what I'm saying?  Some people like to do things with their hands.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  You do?
R:  Yeah.  I mean, when I was -- when we were younger we used to sew and, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and we made some, you know -- some pieces of clothing and stuff and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- my latest, um, thought over the winter was to -- to knit a scarf, which I never did, but it was something -- one of those things that I had thought about doing and, um ...
L:  Yeah.  Well, I've never done knitting.  I've done a little bit of crocheting --
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  -- and that's very relaxing.  But knitting no, I haven't quite gotten into knit one, purl two.  But my mother in law does that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she knits very well.  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- my sister knows all about it --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and so she taught me some but, um, I haven't really -- I haven't really got on to making, you know [LAUGH], anything that I would be able to wear outside.
L:  Right.  Right.  [LAUGH]  Okay.  So, you're more of a reader and a writer.  What kinda -- what kinda stuff do you like to write, poetry or like stories?
R:  Um, I -- I'm -- I'm really bad at creative writing.  I can only write about things that I know about.
L:  Okay.
R:  Like I -- I -- I like writing, um, like research papers in school, you know, like I was always very good at that and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I like keeping a journal also but, um --
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  -- but I also -- I've always thought one day that I would write a book --
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  -- but I knew that if I ever did write a book it would -- it would have to be something about -- from -- from my life --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like a story of my life or something 'cause I'm -- I'm a terrible creative writer.  [LAUGH]  I'm bad at telling --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- like imagining stories, but I'm good at writing, you know --
L:  Right.  Right.  I know what you mean.
R:  -- in general.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  I'm not too creative when it comes to writing myself.  But a journal that's cool.  I've been trying to, um, keep one myself, uh --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- one and off done it for about a couple of years.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I'm thirty four.  [LAUGH]  So, I got a little late start.  How old are you, Nancy?
R:  I'm twenty eight.
L:  Twenty eight.  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Um, but, you know, I'm learning about the whole journaling and how it not necessarily -- you know, like when we were younger we did diaries and that was like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- a kinda log of events.  But this is more about feelings and things we're learning --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and stuff like that the journal is.  So, that's -- that's pretty cool and, um, I know that it's gonna be something neat.  I have three children, uh, aged --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- seven, five and -- and two and a half and so that would be something kinda neat for them to maybe look in -- on -- you know, just something from -- from the past --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know?
R:  When they get older.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, um, I -- I guess my hobbies would be, um, singing [LIPSMACK] and I've picked up a hobby, uh -- I picked up a hobby in the fall running [LAUGH], which is good.
R:  Oh.  That's great.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've never been interested in that in my life, Nancy.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I'm not, uh, interested in sweating or anything of the sort.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I got kinda motivated because I had to lose just a few pounds after, um, having three children --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- not many, but just enough where I had to exert myself and so I was doing Taebo and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- different things of the sort, you know, and I thought okay, this running thing, I went in there, doing it for the burn 'cause, you know, you can burn a lotta calories and --
R:  Yeah.
L: -- and, uh, it was really neat to have to compete against yourself and see how hard you could push yourself --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so, um, I did a five K. back in the fall.
R:  Oh, gosh!
L:  I walked probably most of it, but I didn't finish last.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I was really proud of myself.  But, um ...
R:  Well, hey, you know, like it's -- everything takes little steps at a time.  [LAUGH]
L:  It really does.
R:  So, finishing it is an achievement.  So ...
L:  It really does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I entered.  So, that was -- that was a biggie for me and, uh, I really like it.  You really do get that runner's high and you really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- your body really does, um, get used to it.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Yeah.  That's so funny because I used to hate running also and then --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- when I was -- maybe eight, ten years ago for some reason I just started running and I really like it.
L:  Okay.
R:  I don't do it as much now, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- but I -- it -- it was just relaxing for me.  Like I always hated it in high school --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- when they do sports and stuff.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But after I started doing it for myself I got -- actually really liked it and it was --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- something that I really enjoy doing.
L:  Yeah, and I think that's probably the big -- the switch of motivation for yourself that -- that'll get you going, you know?
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I really enjoy that and, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- music -- music is my -- my thing I think probably, um ...
R:  Uh-huh.  Do you sing in like a choir in church or do you ...?
L:  Yeah.  Actually I lead the music at my church, yes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I've just recently stepped into that position and, uh, been singing at church for years, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so, um, it's really neat.  I've entered a contest, um -- I sing Christian music and so I entered a, uh, contemporary, um, artist -- I'm sorry, Christian artist talent search here recently.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I'm waiting -- I'm actually in the process of waiting to hear from them.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I entered it and actually I made -- made the semi finals.  So, I'm gonna see what happens this year.  But I'm pretty pumped about that.
R:  Wow!  That's great.  [LAUGH]
L:  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's one -- I have to get, uh -- my friend has a [MN] -- a friend of my husband I -- I went to school with that has a studio in his home, he and his wife, and so, um, whenever I need to record a demo for anything, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I just say, "Hey, Sam.  Can I --?"  He lives like -- I don't know -- fifteen minutes from my Mom's house.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, anyway, it's so much fun, Nancy.  Any -- any singer or musician you talk to who can get in the studio --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's like, oh, this is the most awesome experience, like wow!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm really doing this, you know, and to hear --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- yourself with some studio work.  So, that's -- that's a big, uh -- I guess it's more than a hobby to me, it's more of a passion.  You know what I'm saying?
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], so anyway that's -- that's -- that's what I do.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  I think everybody ...
R:  That's wonderful especially since you have the chance to record demos and things.
L:  I know.  Yeah.
R:  Like you can actually kinda fulfill, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- your passions and all that.
L:  I know.  I know.  It's -- it's a wonderful lifetime experience I can tell you.  But I think everybody should have a, um -- a hobby.  You need -- you just need a break from the regular, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.
L:  -- routines in life, uh ...
R:  Yeah.  I think -- I think, um [LIPSMACK] -- I -- I guess some people, you know, are very, very, um, you know, focused on -- on their hobbies and I just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- for some reason it just didn't -- I've been busy or -- 'cause I'm in --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- school too and -- and so sometimes you don't have the time to really put the energy into it.
L:  That's right.
R:  But it's something that I like.  I know -- I recognize that I should start to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- do and just really set aside the time for it and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Now, what -- what it is you do, Nancy?  Did you say school?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Are you in school right now?
R:  I'm getting a master's in --
L:  Really?
R:  -- in international relations.
L:  Are ya?
R:  Yeah.
L:  What -- what, uh -- what point are you in your program?
R:  Um, I just have one semester left.  I took a leave of absence this year.  That's why I'm back in Pittsburgh.  But I -- normally I -- I go to school in D.C., um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- at, uh, John Hopkins, the school in D.C. and, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I have one more semester.
L:  John Hopkins, yeah.  I know where that is.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Fantastic.
R:  So, yeah.
L:  That's just great.
R:  After that I'm not sure what I'm gonna be doing.  But, uh --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- for now it's just, you know, finishing school.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And let me see, how -- how much time did you take between your bachelor's and starting up your master's program 'cause you're twenty eight, right?
R:  Yeah.  Um, it's probably about four years I think.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, probably four or five years --
L:  Okay.  Okay.
R:  -- and I was, you know, working during that time.
L:  Okay.  What made you decide to go back?
R:  Well, I always knew that I wanted to go back to study.  You know, I always knew I wanted --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to get a higher degree --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- um, but I never really knew exactly what it would be and I was --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- at business school also, but I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- because, uh, I had done some business when I was in college and it --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- wasn't kinda exciting for me.  So, I thought international --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- relations would be more interesting --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I -- I love to travel and, you know, like I'm --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- interested in learning about other cultures and stuff.  So, that -- that would be more appropriate for my interests and so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's why I ended up there.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  So, that's kinda like a hobby for you, the international traveling kind of thing?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Have you ...?  
R:  I guess so.  It is.  I mean --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like it's -- it's one of the things that I -- one of the things I would absolutely love to do, you know?
L:  Oh, that's fantastic.
R:  See other places.  Visit other countries and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Is there, uh, a particular ...?
R:  [inaudible].
L:  Yeah.  Is there a particular, uh, region of the world that you're, you know, most fascinated with?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, I --
L:  You just like it all?  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I -- the parts that -- I've traveled to Western Europe a lot --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK], Asia, like parts of Asia, like China and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Japan.  But --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- I've never been to Africa.  I've never been to, you know, any part in the Middle East really and ...
L:  Okay.
R:  So, those are the places I think would be very interesting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And South America too, um ...
L:  Yeah.  South America.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I've never been anywhere.  Well, I went to Costa Rica, but that is not -- you know, like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- Costa Rica is not exactly the most, you know, Latin American country you can visit.  [LAUGH]  It's quite ...
L:  Yeah.  I've gotta ya.  You're right.  You're right.  Well, that is fascinating, Nancy.  I, uh -- you're speaking to somebody who has -- hasn't ever yet, um, been overseas.  So, I'm kinda, uh --
