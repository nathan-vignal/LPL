L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Good, how are you?
L:  Good.  My name is Liz.  
R:  I'm Kelly.  I'm --
L:  Hi, Kelly.
R:  I'm from Wisconsin.
L:  [MN]
R:  A little town near Madison.
L:  Oh, cool.
R:  And where are you from?
L:  Well, I currently live in New Jersey.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, sou- -- like all the way south by Cape May.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I was born in Pennsylvania but ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, um, so what kind of hobbies do you have?
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Well, um, lately I've started -- well, I'd say probably in the last six months or [MN] so, um, [LIPSMACK] refunding and, uh, couponing, and then my latest one is mystery shopping.
L:  Oh, I do that too.
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  It's -- I've just started that one, like, in the last, probably, two or three months.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And -- and I think that one's a lot of fun.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I -- I do too.  I just do it, you know, just on the side and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, it's -- it's hard down here, I don't know about there, but it's hard here because, um, [LIPSMACK] I live in a small area --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and I -- the closest big shopping area is, like, forty, forty five minutes away.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, so I don't really have, you know, there's not a lot.  But there is a -- a couple of stores I go to often.  So that's good.
R:  Mhm.  
L:  Do --
R:  Do you do the, uh, restaurants to that or ...?
L:  I do.  Um, I haven't --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- yet.  Um, I was actually -- because I live close to Philly and I have family there --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I was gonna do one but everything fell through and I wasn't able to make it, so I -- I didn't take the shop thank goodness, so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I was gonna do, um, an Olive Garden.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  That'd be a good one.
L:  Yeah, that would be good.
R:  Yeah.
L:  What kind do you do?
R:  Well, um, [LIPSMACK] I -- every month it seems like for the past four months I do a big, um, shopping mall in Madison which is kind of like you, about forty five minutes from where I live.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And, um, but that one pays pretty well.  They do a little lunch with it and it's, like, forty bucks for a couple hours, you know.
L:  Oh, that's good, yeah.
R:  And, um, you have to go round to eight different departments in the store and -- and, um, it's pretty detailed.  You have to get all their names, descriptions and --
L:  Right.
R:  And then you have to get them so far as to think that you're going to buy something and then go back and -- and say that you've changed your mind --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- or you have to think about it.  That's kind of the [LAUGH] hardest part I think.
L:  Right.  Right
R:  And then, um, [LIPSMACK] I also have done, um, some Famous Dave barbecue restaurants.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  They -- they have around --
L:  We don't --
R:  -- here.  It's not really my favorite restaurant so I don't --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- know if I'll do that one [LAUGH] too --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- much any more.  But, that was -- that was kind of interesting.  And, um, the most recent one I started doing was a, um, grocery store which really is kind of nice because it's -- it doesn't pay a lot but you have to get groceries so ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  Well, that's -- I actually do a couple grocery stores.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I do a fast food restaurant.  
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Um, I do Ar- -- an Arby's.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, that's like the -- the only thing down here.  Um, there are McDonalds.  I -- I work for a company that does McDonalds --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but not down in this area yet so I'm waiting.  That's better.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, and I do a couple -- I do, um, two different supermarkets.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, but I do -- there's a bunch of them around here.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.
L:  Believe it or not we have, like, tens of thousands of supermarkets.
R:  Oh, well, that's good.
L:  So I get to do like three of one store and two of the other.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So that's okay.  So -- but it's fun.  And, like you said, they don't pay a lot but it's good because you're going there anyway.
R:  Right.
L:  You know, and I -- I just pick up a couple things what I need and it -- it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- works out pretty well.  And --
R:  So how do many do you do a month, do you think?
L:  Um, usually I do like two or three for one company.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The other company, um, they do -- I get one, maybe two --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- from -- from them.  And the other one is like, um, usually two or three. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  So you -- you know it varies.  So, but [MN] you know, it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  It -- it seems like they're always all together.  
R:  Right.
L:  You know, so ...
R:  It does, doesn't it?  That's how --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- mine go too.  It's like one week you'll have five and then --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you won't have any the next week or something.
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  And [MN] ...
L:  So ...  So what else do you like to do?
R:  Um, [LIPSMACK] well, I guess that I just started this kind a coupon and refunding, um, thing.  I found this -- this website, um, which is actually where I got this Fisher study number.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I've never done anything like this before.
L:  No, me neither.
R:  So this --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- really kind of an easy way to -- to, um, make a little money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  It's kind a --
L:  Oh, definitely.  
R:  And -- 
L:  I like to talk on the phone.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, and it's real interesting.  I've -- I've gotten to talk to, you know, all different people --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so ...  Um, last night, actually, I got somebody from New York so [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, really, okay.
R:  It's interesting that you're from New Jersey.  And, um, otherwise I've got three kids, so I don't have a lot of time for, um, any other real big hobbies.
L:  [MN]
R:  I just -- I work on the weekends as a nurse so ...
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I, um, [LIPSMACK] ...
L:  Well, that -- that keeps you busy.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's for sure with the kids.  I only have one daughter so ...
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I mean, as far as hobbies go, I mean I love to read.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, my husband and I, and my daughter, we go to, um, it's a lacrosse team.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's a major indoor lacrosse.  It's only in the wintertime.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And that's like one of our favorite things to do.  
R:  Oh, okay.  That's interesting.
L:  Uh, but m- my daughter loves to go.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- and I -- I like to do cross stitch but I never get a chance to do that so ...
R:  Right.  
L:  I -- I like --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- reading.  At least I get a chance to do so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I have a two year old so I, uh ...
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, then you're real busy.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, but I do -- and I work from home so, um, you know, I [MN] -- that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- takes up a lot of my time 'cause I work during the day and then I work in the evening too.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So I kind of split up my time so I have time with her and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- stuff like that.  So -- but, you know, I -- I -- and I like -- I mean I like to, you know, I like to hang out with her and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, you know, we play and -- but as -- the hobby --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is, my definite favorite thing is to go to the lacrosse games.  That's like [MN] that's our big, you know, we --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- look forward to that.  Like, and usually it's almost every week -- 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that we get to go.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So I mean it's, you know, uh -- like I said it's only in the winter.  It's only from, like, January --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- til, like, April.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, but it's almost every week so it's [MN] -- it's good.  It's fun.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And we used to travel, like, and go to road games.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  But, um, now we don't do that.  We can't do that with her.
R:  Right.  It's harder with a ...
L:  So that makes it ...  So ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  But besides that, um, yeah, that was -- I guess that's it.  I mean, I like to, um, walk and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  [MN]  I definitely, uh, surf the web.  That's one of my --
R:  Right.
L:  And play games on the [LAUGH] web.
R:  Right. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Well, I've just started actually, um, [LIPSMACK] -- I just got my computer, oh, gosh, I'm so late at getting it.  Like this past winter and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I'd had a computer years ago but I wasn't really too interested in it with three little kids.  My kids are three, five and seven.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I didn't have any time.  But now that my two older ones are in school I have a little more time.  You know, when my youngest one is -- is watching cartoons or entertaining herself for a while --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I find I can actually get on my computer so that's become more of a hobby lately.
L:  Right.
R:  And then, you know, like you walking, with her, taking her to the park.
L:  Mhm, I do that.
R:  It's always busy and then the older kids they -- they have their different, um, lessons that are their hobbies.  My oldest is seven and she's in dance class and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- Brownies.  And my son is five and he's in -- gonna be in T ball this summer and stuff.
L:  Oh, okay.  You'll definitely be busy.
R:  Their hobbies are ...  [LAUGH]  
L:  Your hobbies --
R:  -- keep me pretty busy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Your ho- -- their hobbies become your hobbies.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  Right.  Watching their games and ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, that's fun though.  
R:  It is, yeah.
L:  I mean it's nice to get to be out there.  You know, and you meet other people and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  So that's [MN] -- that's good too.
R:  Right.
L:  And that's -- you know, that's what I like about the lacrosse too.  Is that we meet a lot -- we met a lot of people.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I mean, I have tons of friends.  I -- I've been going for, like, I don't know, twelve years or something like that.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, you know, we meet a lot of people and -- and it's -- it's just nice.  It's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  You know.  It's an -- it's a fun thing.  But then I take my daughter for a walk and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- actually my husband and I are trying to start walking but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we're in the process of -- of a move so we kind of have to curtail that right now but --
R:  Uh-huh
L:  -- um, you know that -- that's one of the other things that we like to do and, you know, I like to do, is walk and --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- stuff like that so ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But ...
R:  Yeah, now that it's springtime and everything.  I guess, we've started the walking too and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- mostly it's my -- I guess, uh, my youngest who still sits in the stroller.  She's three and then my son, if I can get him to walk to school.  He goes to afternoon kindergarten and we --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and we walk there too.  And -- and during the winter I walk on my treadmill but I'm --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- getting a little bored with [LAUGH] that.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  That does.
R:  It's much nicer to get out in the nice weather and ...
L:  Definitely.
R:  You know.
L:  See at least your three year old walk -- rides in the stroller.  My two year old won't.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I've had -- you know, my oldest was like that.  She would not settle down and -- and sit in the stroller [LAUGH] at all.
L:  Yeah, she just wants to go and go and go.
R:  Mhm.  Get out and, yeah, putts around and ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  Explore.  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So she's definitely my biggest hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause, you know  --
R:  Of course.
L:  -- 'cause most of my time is with her but ...
R:  Right.
L:  You know, but, yeah, it's um, I guess that's all the hobbies that I have.  I mean --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'm not very good at anything else.  I just made, um, I did a -- since we're moving I made this little decoration thing.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I like it.  Like [MN] flower arranging and stuff.
R:  Oh.  Mhm.
L:  But I -- I, you know, it takes me forever and I'm, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I just do it for fun.  [MN]  You know, it's not --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- really a hobby.  I just do it occasionally.
R:  I don't really have the patience for, um -- my sister's really into that, um, [LIPSMACK] decorative art hanging or, uh, flower arranging and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she makes beautiful artwork, and I just don't have a creative bone in my body.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I cannot -- I don't do any knit- knitting or needlepoint --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or anything.  Um, actually my kids, I brought them some stamping --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- kits, 'cause a lot of the people I work with make beautiful cards out of their own stamps and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and that type of thing.  I -- I could probably handle that 'cause that doesn't take any real [LAUGH] artwork.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I just don't have the patience for it.
L:  Right.
R:  Uh, hobbies that involve a lot of, uh, time and effort and --
L:  Right.
R:  -- artistic ability actually.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Well, that's why I'm surprised I can do cross stitch.  Because I'm the same way as you.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I -- and I love to cook.  That's like I -- I love to cook and bake but you know what?
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I bake -- I can -- I can bake a cake, like, with the best of them from scratch --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or whatever.  But, you know what, it never looks good.
R:  Oh.
L:  Because [MN] it
