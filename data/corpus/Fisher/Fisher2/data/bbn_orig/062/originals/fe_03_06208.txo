R:  [NOISE] Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hello. [LAUGH]  I'm Chris.
L:  Hi.  Hi, I'm Sharon.
R:  Hi, Sharon, how are you?
L:  Good.  Can you hear me okay?
R:  Yes.  Can you hear me?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- wasn't sure 'cause I have a cellphone.
R:  Uh, me too. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Have you ever done this before?
R:  Uh, yeah, this is my third call actually, so I think it's my last. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh okay.  Um, so we just automatically talk about the hobby?
R:  Hobby, yes.  Do you have hobbies?
L:  I actually ha- -- I write for a hobby, I guess I could say.
R:  Okay.  What do you like to write?
L:  Well, generally I was trying to write my memoirs and, um, I joined, um a writing guild, w- uh, it was like Writers' Digest has, um, a correspondence course through the mail.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So it ended up that I was, um, doing exercises which were different types of writing, just to see what I would really like.  And it ended up I wrote a children's story that they said was publishable, which is exciting but, you know --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- you have to pursue all that on your own. [LAUGH]
R:  Right, right. [SIGH]
L:  And very time consuming, writing.
R:  Oh, I'm sure it is.  Now, do you -- do you handwrite everything or you use a computer?
L:  I use a computer but years ago I'll tell ya, I used to handwrite, I never thought that you could, um, do on a, uh, you know, I didn't think --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- that I could adjust to the thoughts on a computer, if that makes sense at all.
R:  Right, right.
L:  What do you do for a hobby?
R:  Um, well --
L:  Or have, I mean.
R:  I li- -- I like to work out, I used to be an aerobic instructor and so, you know, now it's just --
L:  God bless ya!
R:  Excuse me?
L:  God bless ya! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] I just got off the treadmill for an hour and a half.  I gave up on doing -- killing myself. [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] Well I've --
L:  I just watch [LAUGH] --
R:  I've done it for years so it doesn't really kill me and, you know, it used to be part of my job and I still enjoy doing it, and so I guess I consider that my hobby and try to make time, you know, for myself to do that every single day, even with all the other things in your life that you have going on.
L:  Oh I know.  I kinda would consider that more of a job, the -- I mean, cons- -- you know, just for me too in general, just trying to get to exercise all the time, it's just really difficult.
R:  Right, right.  Well, for some people I'm sure it is more of a chore than -- than something fun. [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, so do you find it fun? [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I find it fun.  I mean, like I said, I used --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- to be an aerobic instructor so I have always enjoyed it and --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I always feel, you know, some days it gets hard to get there some days, but I always, always feel better after I'm done and isn't that -- a hobby should be something that makes you feel better.
L:  Well, if you've been doing that for a living, do you recommend, okay, I'm doing the treadmill but I have, um, a bad knee, I'm -- so I can't do aerobics and I ended up straining my leg and I was out for two weeks, so I couldn't exercise much, and I was doing a thing called The Fitness Fire, if you're familiar with that.  But all in all I just figured I'd get back on the treadmill, but if I push myself to a certain point where you're probably like, way past there, you can probably run on a treadmill, and I can't, so I just did like, say, oh, say three point one was my speed, if that makes sense to you?
R:  Yes.
L:  So I just did it where I could -- could be comfortable.  Even though I held on I didn't wanna kill myself.  I was sweating, but I just watched TV, did an hour and a half, at least I figured it's gotta be beneficial at some point.
R:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  I- it is.  I mean, anything that you do besides sitting on the couch and [LAUGH] you know, shoveling food in your face is definitely productive and if you're sweating you're definitely getting your heart rate up, you know, and depending on, you know, your fitness level and your age and -- and other factors, I'm sure, you know, a lotta people d- don't have, you know, work out i- at such a high level to still get the same kind of, you know, heart benefits that other people would have to work out at.
L:  Okay.  Well, I've been on diets forever.  I w- -- I was in law school and now I've been trying to pass the bar exam for two years and here we go again, another stint of sitting on my butt.  I'm also a paralegal so I have been dieting and exercising since the end of June, I'm getting married in August and I just can't get this weight down.  Like, I have --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- twelve pounds [inaudible] I have like, thirty, you know, total to lose, so maybe what, another fifteen would be nice! [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, you -- how about you don't have time for hobbies all a lot!  You sound very busy!  [SIGH]
L:  Exactly.  When they -- I heard the topic I'm like, "Oh, this is a joke isn't it?" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I can't even read anything else but law stuff. [LAUGH]
R:  I'll bet.  I'll bet.  Well, you probably get to do a lotta writing with law school too?
L:  [NOISE] Oh, definitely, it's just not as enjoyable as --
R:  But not as enjoyable. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, being creative with your mind and just going places.  And ever since I was a little girl I've loved to write, I've always had, you know, besides your general diaries and so forth, I always made up stories and even when I'm stressed, 'cause law school -- actually, the worse thing is I get more creative [NOISE] when -- when I end up, um, studying. [LAUGH]  So that doesn't help. [NOISE]
R:  Well, but it's nice when your hobby provides an outlet for you, for your stress and, you know, helps you --
L:  [NOISE] So --
R:  -- get through those times.
L:  Yeah, I guess you could say it's almost the same thing as when you exercise, when you're release the endorphins [NOISE] and something like that I just feel really good about putting -- you know, you go into a flow mode and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you just can't stop and -- and sometimes I wake up --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you know, it's four o'clock in the morning and I just have to write, it's crazy.
R:  Right.
L:  [LAUGH]  But I'm just hoping someday this hobby will turn into a well paying job from a book! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Especially if I can't pass the damn bar, I'd better write that book! [LAUGH]
R:  That's true.  I've heard a lotta people that they turn their hobbies into high paying careers or jobs or [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, well --
R:  And that must be nice.
L:  Yeah, definitely.  And I think my personality is geared more towards writing than it is law, believe it or not, you know.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just find it more fun.
R:  Well --
L:  But, uh, that's just me.  So, do you have any other kinda hobbies?
R:  Um, I like to read although, you know, I don't have as much time to read and, um, you know, I like to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I have kids so, you know, I -- I -- I like to just go and hang out and do her kind of things, her -- you know, she has -- she plays soccer and she plays softball and I guess those are her hobbies. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh definitely.  I have kids too so I know what it's like. [NOISE]
R:  Right.
L:  We are fortunate to have a swimming pool in the backyard.  I don't know if you'd call swimming a hobby or just exercise but when I can get out there I really, you know, do do the exercises, you know, I just, you know, draw my knees up, you know, to my chest and try to get the gut down there and get something moving, circulating.
R:  Oh yeah --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I think anything that you enjoy doing can be a hobby, or you know, [SIGH] anything that you wanna fill up your free time with.
L:  I don't care for golf.  That's one thing I tried and I can't stand, absolutely, I --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- kept swinging myself in circles.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, I -- I've never tried it and my husband -- my husband loves it but I just don't see the -- I don't see the fun in that kind of a hobby, it seems to me a very frustrating sport.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I did try skiing and I loved it and I thought, "This is it, this is the absolute best, if you, you know".  It's -- it's a very expensive hobby --
R:  Right.
L:  -- but that's where I dislocated my knee and blew it out and have been in trouble ever since, you know, on certain occasions if I step the wrong way or move the wrong way I [NOISE] -- because of nothing holding anything in that -- in my left kneecap, so that's where I strain my, um, thigh muscles.
R:  Oh.
L:  You know.
R:  Oh yeah, skiing's probably a harder sport hobby to have for your -- for your legs.  I mean, I [MN], you know, I live in Colorado so [LAUGH] skiing is a --
L:  Oh you do?
R:  -- big sport out here.  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh wonderful.  I live on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.  Um --
R:  Do you have a lotta skiing out there?
L:  No skiing, we live in the seashore area so there's not much -- I mean, in Mats- -- there are some places, I guess, that'll take ya [NOISE] two hours to get to [NOISE] and my fiance has a [NOISE] -- a home in, um, well, they call it a vacation home [NOISE] in Maine, and there's the Sugarloaf, big ski areas [NOISE] in that.  It would just have been a perfect, if I could continue doing the hobby.
R:  Right.
L:  But I just, you know, [NOISE].  But unfortunately I can't.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But, my, uh, you know what?  My -- I li- -- I could call this a hobby, I like to go on vacations! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's a good hobby to have! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] 'Cause every time I get back from one I'm already planning another one so I don't get depressed from the first one! [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, I can understand that! [LAUGH]
L:  So I really enjoy doing that, so -- I mean, like, you know, I'm sure there's all kinds of hobbies that people have, I mean, you know, collecting things [NOISE].  I mean, I collect, uh, there we go, I collect little piglets, little piggies, like piggy banks, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- that thing with a -- and that thing with a pig, like, um, like piggy banks?  I started --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- collecting piggy banks at one point.  And so I've been doing that.  At one point I did collect, um, um, those carousel horses, anything with a carousel horse like, you know, miniature ones, I just -- God, I'd love to have a big one.  So I've done that in the past.
R:  That's -- I -- I always like people who collect things --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and it's always easy to buy them gifts because --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- you can keep your eye out for that kinda stuff --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and pick it up as you go along and then you always have something to give to them. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Definitely.  So I've --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- been on this big whirl with little piggies lately.  It started out as a joke, my, um, fiance would pinch my butt in public and I'd call him Piggy, and then my mother, you know, saw it one day, you know, he was just being an idiot actually, just trying to make fun, [NOISE] and so that got to be a joke, so now everybody gives us piggy stuff, you know! [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And then I got into it [LAUGH].  And I'm getting married so I got him a -- a pig -- like a silver pig, for a joke, for our wedding. [LAUGH]  I know it sounds stupid but, you know.
R:  No, it's a
