L:  Hi.  I'm Tina.
R:  Hello.  I'm Paula.  [NOISE]
L:  Hi.  Where are you calling from?
R:  Southern Indiana.
L:  Oh, I'm from Trenton, Texas.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, hobbies.  Mine seem to be my children these days.
R:  [LAUGH] I know that feeling.
L:  [LAUGH] You've lived that, or are still living that?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, do you have any other hobbies?
R:  Um, I like to cross-stitch.
L:  Do you get to do it very often?
R:  No, not at all.
L:  I like to cross-stitch too.
R:  A long time ago now.  I used to -- I made some really cool stuff.  But just since the birth of my daughter, which is like two years ago the only time I ever work on it is when I take her back -- every eight weeks I take her back for a research drug.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And every sixteen weeks I take her to Indy and during -- during the every sixteen week stay I work on the one project I'm working on for about three years now.  [LAUGH]
L:  You go for what?
R:  I get my daughter a research drug --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- which requires a stay in the hospital with her for three days.
L:  Uh-huh.  What is the drug for?
R:  She's got a brittle bone disease and it helps strengthen her bones.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I always take my cross-stitch with me as my hobby and I just sit there and do that.  [NOISE]
L:  Well, now, along those lines has she developed any hobbies to pass her time?
R:  Um, she's too little at this point.
L:  Oh.
R:  She just turned two.
L:  Oh, my.
R:  So, she doesn't have any hobbies.
L:  Yeah.  No, not yet.
R:  Nope.  Except she loves to watch Barney, that's kinda her hobby.
L:  Hey, that was my hobby.  [LAUGH]  I love Barney.
R:  And my five year old watches Barney so much it's her hobby that by the time my little one was born she knew what Barney sounded like.
L:  [LAUGH] Yep.  Mine too.  Mine are a little older.  Well, ten, eight and five.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, we're about to do the great toy exchange.  I have toys in a locked cabinet and they have to exchange me some of their toys for what's in the cabinet.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, neat.  So, what kinda hobbies do you have?
L:  Um, well, I don't know that it's so much a hobby.  It's something I do.  I cake -- I decorate cakes.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, I mean, like for birthdays or, um -- at the moment I need to make one --
R:  I do the -- I do that too.
L:  I need to make one for a G.A. director tonight for church.
R:  I used to do that.  I haven't done it in a long time.  But, uh, growing up I had those kinda hobbies, doing that.
L:  Uh-huh.  And, I mean, I'm an occupational therapist.  So --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- [NOISE] I've learned, you know, at T.W.U. you go through two -- no, four semesters, two years of craft because you have to learn to analyze all the steps to each task, you know, fine motor skills, cognitive and all that stuff.  So --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  -- I mean, I had to learn woodworking and cross-stitching and curling and embroidering and, um, gosh, loom weaving, ceramics.  I mean, we've done it all.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  So, what is that?  Uh [NOISE], something of many and master a few.  Well, that's me.
R:  [LAUGH] Cross-stitching is pretty much the only hobby I've really picked up on a hobby basis other than the computer.  But ...
L:  Oh, yes.  I love the computer.  [NOISE]
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Like searches and stuff.  [LAUGH]
R:  But I -- I actually picked cross-stitch up -- my sister used to do it and I picked it up --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I decided to go out one day and buy me a -- a pre made kit of cross-stitch.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I got injured in a real bad accident and ended up in a motel for nine months while I was going through rehabilitation.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I started cross-stitching and I cross-stitched so much stuff by the time I left -- the time I left I'd made my mother a shirt.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I bought her a shirt and cross-stitched her a whole picture on it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I started -- then I made a couple more shirts by the time I left there.
L:  Wow!
R:  Uh, my sis- -- I've probably made my Mom four or five shirts in total --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I've made one for myself and I've made one for my sister -- no, I made two for myself.  I made one for my sister and I think my Mom's got about five of 'em now.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But I've been working on this monopoly board.
L:  A monopoly board?
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's a full to scale monopoly board.
L:  Cross-stitching?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Goodness!  [LAUGH]
R:  And I've been working on it since my daughter was two and a half and she's just about ready to turn six.  [LAUGH]
L:  My goodness!  That's a lotta work.
R:  But I've got all of the outside stitching, like the whole actual board done.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All I have -- and all I have to do is left to fill in some of the colors and some of 'em I didn't do right away and I have left, um -- put -- write monopoly across the middle of it.
L:  Well, now, um, you mentioned your six year old.  Does she have any hobbies?
R:  [MN] Pretty much not.
L:  I have one -- I have one that likes to cook.  She -- she cooks a lot.  She likes to make muffins.  She's eight.  And then, of course, the pictures that you get and hang on your refrigerator or something -- she likes to color.  [NOISE]
R:  This one likes to collect Power Puff.
L:  Okay.  I have one that collects Angel.  She doesn't ...
R:  But she's on -- she's on to anything that's hot, anything different she starts changing.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Before it was anything Barney.  I mean, for Christmas I bought her like Barney tapes and now she's not even into Barney [inaudible].
L:  Oh, yeah.  That'll be good and for a yard sale someday [NOISE] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- or a tag sale.
R:  We have almost every Barney tape there is.
L:  Yes.  We did too and then I sold them.  But we have our Disney Tape --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- but that never come out.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, my two year old's fascination with Barney, we have about every one of 'em.
L:  Well, you know, um, a friend of mine at a yard [NOISE] -- excuse me -- um, a friend of mine -- I was having a -- a yard sale and I was selling all my Barney tapes and she comes up and was like, "You know what?  I was talking to so and so", it was a good friend of hers who works for like Barney Productions and they are like really big in Europe is what she was telling me.  She's like, "You need to save these.  You could probably sell them on eBay for, you know, whatever".  But I have never checked it out.  I just thought it was an interesting fact.
R:  Oh, that's where I bought most of mine.  All of them I bought her for Christmas I bought off eBay.
L:  Oh, I -- yeah, I live eBay.  I got, uh, hooked on [inaudible] from phonics program that's like three hundred dollars.  I got it today.  I only paid fifty dollars.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm going for the hook on phonics one next.  [LAUGH]
R:  eBay is my other big hobby.
L:  Oh, are you ...?
R:  That is my hobby.
L:  Is it?
R:  Yes.  I'm addicted to eBay.
L:  [NOISE] Excuse me just a minute.
R:  I'm for- forever buying something or selling it on eBay.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  I said I'm for- forever buying something -- kinda something and putting it on eBay.
L:  I used to sell beanies on eBay a lot --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- you know, I -- I just have them and I just, you know, look for whatever I need at that point and you can usually find it.
R:  I used to do other people's pictures and put 'em on eBay.  [LAUGH]  I hide[?] 'em.
L:  Oh.  I think I've done that before my beanies 'cause I couldn't -- I didn't have a camera.  So --
R:  Yep.  And that's what I do.
L:  -- you go and you copy a picture and you go through whatever it was and put it on there.  So ...
R:  Yep.  I did that.  I got these Sailor Moon tapes.  I bought 'em all at the dollar store and I don't own a digital camera.  So, I went to a site that sold nothing but Sailor Moons tapes --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and took every one of their pictures and put 'em all together on -- had my niece come and put 'em all together on one picture.
L:  There you go.  That's -- see, that's why the computer is such a wonderful thing.  [LAUGH]
R:  But it was funny because I only spent five dollars on the tapes and she bought 'em for twenty.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  Oh, the same thing, you know, when I was selling my beanies really big.  Oh, my goodness!  They were like oh, the -- the new dolls that had come out.  I forget what they were called.  But I had bought 'em for like eight bucks and I sold each of 'em for thirty five apiece.
R:  [MN]
L:  That was just -- because I had got 'em at the gift shop in the hospital I work at, um [NOISE], 'cause [several inaudible words].
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So, what ...?
R:  Yeah.  I think everybody should have a hobby, have some sort.
L:  Well, something's got to stimulate your brain other than everything else, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  You -- you got to -- to do what you can.
R:  I wish my boyfriend would find a hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know, the funny thing is my husband and I -- I work and he stays home, um, he's had my, gosh, countless knee replacements, shoulder surgery.  But -- so he's at home and he gets the girls up, that's his hobby, the house, you know?  He cleans, he cooks, he does everything and, um, so I can't get him to stop.  So, I guess that would be his hobby, he cleans.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My ex husband was like that.
L:  I put down a water cup and I'll like "Where did you put my cup?"  "In the dishwasher".  [MN]
R:  Yep. 
L:  But anyway, so he considers that his job.
R:  I wish this guy would do something and get that kinda hobby.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, maybe he's finding himself.
R:  Ah?
L:  Isn't that ...?  I said he's finding himself.
R:  Well, I wish he'd find himself --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because he's been off work for a year.  [LAUGH]  I think he's lost himself.
L:  Into the couch we go!  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  He already went through one remote.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]  [PAUSE] My daughter's trying to talk to me without moving her mouth, but doing all these hand signals and I'm not getting it.
R:  [LAUGH] Well, my daughter got up when I came in and smacked her fingers and pointed to the bedroom --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- 'cause she's picking at her dinner and it ain't done yet.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I used to decorate.  I used to collect butterflies growing up.
L:  You used to what?  Collect butterflies?
R:  Yeah.
