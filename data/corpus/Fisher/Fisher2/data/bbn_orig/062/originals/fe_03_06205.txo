L:  Cindy Mc- --
R:  Hello?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, hi, this is Emily.
L:  I'm Cindy.
R:  Hi, Cindy.  So, we're talking about hobbies today?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hobbies.  Um, well I don't -- I'm more -- I'm a college student so [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- time for hobbies is not really available but, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] I like to read. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] I do a lotta cross stitch --
R:  Oh, I love --
L:  -- on plastic canvas.
R:  Oh really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I really like cross stitching but I've never done it on, you said it's a plastic canvas?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Well, so how well does that turn out?
L:  I like it b- --
R:  I- is it more of a ...?
L:  Well, I like it better because you know when you did it -- the -- the regular plasti- -- you know, the ca- -- the craft stitching on material --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- you can't make anything more, with the plastic canvas I can make -- I've made doll houses and --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- trucks and all different things.
R:  Now that is so cool.  I've never heard of that.
L:  Hm.
R:  'Cause everytime someone cross stitches something they usually frame it or put it on a pillow --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and half the time it's, you know, about as far as it goes. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And then you have to be all careful not to get it dirty 'cause you can't wash it and --
L:  Well, see, with the plastic canvas you can wash it.
R:  Oh, that's so cool.  Now, I'm in, uh, Salt Lake City, Utah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Where are you at?
L:  I'm in Greeley, Colorado.
R:  Oh, so you're not too far.
L:  No.
R:  There's, um, a lot of fun things to do out here.  I don't know if you're into skiing, that's one of my other hobbies.
L:  No.  Uh-huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My son l- lived out there for two or three years while he was in the Job Corps in Clearfield.
R:  Oh.  Yeah, there's -- it's my -- it's -- it's probably seeing, you know, lots of snow in the winter, lots of people coming to ski and, yeah, that sort of thing.
L:  Well, he said he liked it, so ...
R:  [LAUGH] It's nice to get a taste of more than one season.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um ... I don't know, I like to go up to the mountains, that's a sort of hobby, kinda just --
L:  Well, I like the mountains too but I -- you know, I just like to look at 'em and don't --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- really care to --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like to watch my husband do the fishing and stuff.
R:  Yeah, that's true.  I -- it's hard to kinda get out and do that kinda thing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I don't know.  Uh, [several inaudible words] out movies is a hobby but, if you could!  I like -- I don't know, I love movies.
L:  I --
R:  That's something I do a lot. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  [PAUSE]
R:  I like --
L:  But basically that's all I do, i- well, I also knit and crochet but I like to cross stitch the best.
R:  Yeah, and I've been -- I -- I learned how to knit once and I've forgotten.  I need to remember again because I've been doing some crocheting.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And I don't know if I don't know, um, just how [inaudible] right into it but it seems like any time I wanna do anything it just takes forever.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Because I just -- it tends to be this tight stitch and it's like, even if I just wanted to make a scarf or something, it -- it takes so long! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But now I g- -- I didn't really know -- I -- my grandmother tried to teach me how to crochet and I couldn't figure it out and then a- as soon as she passed away I picked it up and I could do it.
R:  Really?
L:  Mhm.
R:  See, I wonder if -- it sounds like you just get more time for it then I'll figure it out, figure out some trick to it or something.
L:  Yeah. [NOISE]
R:  Um ...  Although my sister in law's taken to doing like, these little hats for all her -- her dolls that she collects.
L:  Oh.
R:  So I'm gonna have to have her help me out on the crochet. [LAUGH]
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH] Get my mother in law to teach me how to knit [MN].
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  I really -- it's a kind of a --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it c- -- it -- it's a calm- -- to me it's calming.
R:  Yeah. [NOISE] [MN]  Like, I've -- wherever[?] I go a lot of, um, social gatherings I've been [LAUGH] -- I -- a pregnant lady that I know, everywhere we go she takes her knitting.
L:  Mm.
R:  Even like -- just very calming, soothing for her, especially where she's pregnant and making a cute little sweater for her baby.
L:  Yeah, I did that, m- made that f- -- I made blankets and sweaters for both of my boys when they were babies.
R:  Oh.  See, I've gotta figure it out before I have kids so that I can --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- knit them some cute blankets and things.  Just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I think that's what you have, is the things that, you know, people have made for you.  Like, I have things that my grandma made but it's really nice to, you know, after they wear 'em for however long or you -- that you can put it away and they can keep it for a while.
L:  Mhm.  I've still got my boys little outfits I made when they were little and their blankets, so --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I can pass it o- -- you know, pass it on to my grandkids whenever I have 'em.
R:  That's really nice idea.  Get a little chest for it.
L:  But I've made, uh, like with the plastic canvas, I've gotten to where I make Christmas decorations every year --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- and I give those out as Christmas presents and everybody just loves those because, you know, it's something you've made for 'em and that it -- it lasts and you can keep it from year to year and put it up on the tree.
R:  Exactly.  Yet it didn't, you know, it took maybe your time but it -- you didn't have to [NOISE] spend as much money, where --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- sometimes I feel like Christmas is just like, you know, where'd all the money go? [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  But see, now I do --
R:  It's a really good way --
L:  -- most of my Christmas presents and everything, I've found something that they like and I make it out of the plastic canvas, so basically all I've got into it is my time and, you know, the cost of my materials, which isn't that much.
R:  Yeah.  That's r- nice.  Um, [NOISE] I [NOISE] -- I think it's nice to -- the homemade gifts, I just -- I really like that idea, I wish I had a lotta time for it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [SIGH]  Kinda get busy, I know. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [MN]
R:  One thing I -- I love to do, I just haven't been able to, I love scrapbook and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- boy, it's hard to get time to do stuff like that.
L:  It is.
R:  But I think with summer, you know, I kinda have a little bit of a break from school for about two months, so ... get some more hobbies going.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just 'cause it gets busy.  I'm sure everything -- I don't know if you work or not but [SIGH] --
L:  Looking for work and it's hard right now.
R:  It is.  I -- I'm not sure if I like my job but I'm scared to [LAUGH] -- it's hard to find something else and so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you look but [LAUGH].
L:  I've put in application after application and it seems like they mor- -- they want the younger people instead of us older folks.
R:  Oh, and see, that's my problem, I don't have enough, you know, skills, or I don't have a degree yet, I'm not to the point where I, you know, I'm just below that. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.
R:  They want the young people that have already finished school.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So [LAUGH] --
L:  But then they tell me with, uh, you know, with nine eleven and then with the war, that, you know, things are -- they say jobs are tough right now, if you've got one you'd better keep it.
R:  Exactly, which is why I've been very reluctant to try and, you know, don't let 'em know I've put in any applications anywhere else, I just kinda ... keep it to myself and see if, you know, if you get a job offer then you give 'em your two weeks notice instead of --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- putting yourself in a boat.
L:  Yeah, really.
R:  Yeah.  But it does take away -- it's nice though --
L:  Oh, I know,
R:  I do take ... some of my hobbies to work.  I have a little bit of time there when it's slow but not a lot.  Huh.
L:  Well, have you ever done the cross stitch?
R:  Yeah, I have done it but I've only done it on, um, you could say, just like that cheesecloth type stuff, whatever that ...
L:  Well, if you've ever done that, you know, if you can pick you up a book you can get 'em at the hobby stores, and once you've done that, it's the same stitches and everything.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]
L:  'Cause, see, my sister taught to cross stitch on material and then she gave me the plastic canvas and I thought, "Well, I prefer this" but it's basically the same s- -- the same stitches that you use in your regular cross stitch on the material.
R:  And you're just doing it on plastic instead and it --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- still has the little holes and everything, so I think I know what you're talking about now that I'm thinking about it.  That w- --
L:  'Cause see, like, I've made semi trucks out of 'em, I've made doll --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- houses and Kleenex boxes and all sorts of different things.  I made my sister, she's -- didn't have any grandbabies --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- but she wanted the Barbie doll furniture so I made her about five or six rooms plus the furniture.
R:  Oh my goodness, that's amazing.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Now, and that is really -- and not something you -- like you say, and you can wash it and it will last.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You don't have to [inaudible] it and you can [several inaudible words] together.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That is really neat.
L:  And then, uh, my son, where he works, he found a little gal out there that had a little girl and [NOISE] he had me make a doll h- -- a little, it's about, oh, actually maybe nine, ten inches tall, but see, it's complete with the furniture and the f- -- and the little doll house family, so ... and --
R:  Oh, even the family?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh, that is fun.
L:  But what I, you know, that sorta thing --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- is washable and the -- the kids just love 'em.
R:  I know and it's -- it's something different.  I think sometimes -- like, my husband and I were talking about this [several inaudible words] -- some of the toys that you get in the store, they do too much thinking for the children, you have to get 'em something that they can creatively use.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So it's nice that there -- it's something totally different.  I think it would [NOISE] stretch 'em more creatively 'cause then [NOISE] they're playing with it, it's not like it's a talking toy that does all the talking for them or whatever.
L:  Oh yeah.
