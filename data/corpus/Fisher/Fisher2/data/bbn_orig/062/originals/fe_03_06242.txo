R:  Hi.
L:  Good afternoon.  I'm Gayle.
R:  Hi, Gayle.  My name is Jabeen[?].  I'm from New York.
L:  I couldn't hear your name.
R:  [MN]  Jabeen.
L:  I still can't quite hear it.
R:  Jabeen.  
L:  Jabeen?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay.  That's an unusual name.  
R:  Yes.  It is.  I'm from New York.  How 'bout you?  Where you from?
L:  California.
R:  Oh, wow.  I've been getting a lot of Californians.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, great.  
R:  Wow.
L:  Um, well, you know, I feel like everybody should have a hobby.  I --
R:  Yeah, I do too.
L:  I sew.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And I do spend some time at it, and I search ebay a lot for little sewing bargains.
R:  Oh, you sew.  Oh, that's great.
L:  What do you do for a hobby?
R:  Well, I like to read.  I have a couple.  I like to read.  I like to go out for walks.
L:  Oh, I read too.  I'm an avid reader.
R:  Yes.  Um, and I like to surf the net.  That's a big one.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  That's a big hobby.  You know, I wish I knew how to sew but unfortunately I don't know how to sew.  
L:  Well --
R:  Um, just -- I can do little things like buttons, you know.
L:  Well, you know, a lot of the sewing machines today come with -- with, uh, either videos or CDs that teach you how to use 'em.
R:  Oh, really?  Oh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- well, that's pretty cool.  Can you make, like, dresses and shirts and pants and ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  Wow.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  And did you teach yourself or did someone teach you?
L:  Well, I had some lessons at the, uh, sewing center where I bought my machine.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And then I bought a lot of books and stuff on ebay and videos and stuff, and kind of taught myself the rest.
R:  Wow.  So you make your own clothing?
L:  I do make some of it.  Some of it I [LAUGH] buy.  
R:  Oh, that's pretty cool.  That's pretty cool.  So, what, when you were -- when you spend --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- a lot of time sewing what is it that you usually make?
L:  Um, crafty things, like stuffed animals and ...
R:  Oh, that is so cool.  Do you sell it?
L:  No.  I take it over to the, uh, hospital here and give it to the cancer patients on the children's ward.
R:  Oh, that is so wonderful.  That is great.  Now that is a ho- hobby well spent.  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Right now I'm in the market for a new machine but --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- the one I want is six thousand dollars.
R:  Oh, my God.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.  Ebay's awesome though, isn't it?  Maybe you can find your deal on ebay.
L:  Oh, I would not consider buying that high end of a machine on ebay because when, uh, a machine is purchased it's warranted to the first purchaser only.
R:  Oh.
L:  Even though there might be a twenty five year warranty on it.  So the second buyer of a machine has no warranty.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  From the manufacturer.  Even if it's two hours old.  
R:  Oh, wow.
L:  So ...
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  I mean, if -- if I were gonna buy a -- a -- a cheaper one, you know, like a two or three hundred dollar machine I might consider that.  I have bought [inaudible] on ebay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um -- which is a -- a -- which is a type of sewing machine but, um, high end line one, no.  
R:  Wow.
L:  And I wouldn't buy one on ebay unless they had the original box to ship it in.  
R:  Oh, I see.  I see.
L:  And the original packing.
R:  I love ebay so much.  I just bought a, um, [LIPSMACK] an MP three CD, portable CD player.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, I love it.  I'm ju- just waiting.  I -- I -- I saw it.  I'm like I can't believe this is so cheap and ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- it was brand new.  It was in the box.  And it's supposed to be coming in any day now and I can't wait.  Oh, my God it's --
L:  Oh, I hope that you didn't buy it from those scammers.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No.  Well, I hope not either.  But I checked the feedback and the feedback seemed to be okay.  You know.
L:  What was the name of the seller?
R:  Oh, gosh, I don't remember.  
L:  Was it Little Ones?
R:  No.  
L:  Oh, good.  Then -- because the scammer was Little Ones.  They just arrested them.  They scammed people out of about two million dollars.
R:  [MN]  You're kidding.  What --
L:  No.
R:  -- they never sent the stuff out?
L:  Never sent the stuff.
R:  But then how did they get all that feedback?
L:  Oh, they gave it to themselves.  They opened up different ebay accounts.
R:  No way.  Oh, my God.  Wow.
L:  They started out small, like, buy selling CDs.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Then +when -- then when they had enough feedback they started selling stereos and TVs and stuff that they never sent people.
R:  Oh, my God --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that's horrible.
L:  Oh, I know.  
R:  Oh, my Lord.
L:  Well, you know people just --
R:  Well, good they got arrested.
L:  Yeah, well, people do have to be careful.
R:  Wow.  See that's why I don't think I'd ever, um, buy, like, a big high end thing, you know.  Like this was twenty four bucks.  So, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- worse case scenario I was out twenty four bucks, you know.
L:  Right.
R:  But, like, yeah that's the high e- -- like, I -- oh, my gosh, it would be hard for me to spend a lot of money on something, you know.
L:  Well, [MN] if you have a hobby though sometimes people will spend money on their hobby.  Like people that collect glass and guns and different hobby things.  Stamps.  Coins.  
R:  Exactly.  Something easy, right?
L:  Well, those kind of people often spend a lot of money on their hobbies.  They've got to have that rare stamp or that rare coin.  
R:  Right.
L:  And they spend a lot, so ...  But it's hard, you know, 'cause anybody can take a picture of anything and put it on ebay.
R:  That's so true.  That is so true.  But [MN] -- but it's just so much fun, isn't it?  [LAUGH] 
L:  It is.  It's a lot of fun and I -- I enjoy buying my sewing stuff on ebay.  I enjoy reading about a lot of sewing books and other --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- books too.  But, um, [MN] life wouldn't be fun without a hobby.  You have to do something to relax.  Even if it's just watch TV.  You know, that's some people's hobby.
R:  Exactly.
L:  They gotta watch --
R:  Exactly.
L:  They've got to watch the latest Survivor program.
R:  It's -- it's somebody -- everybody has to have one to relieve stress, you know.
L:  If they're smart they do.  
R:  Uh-huh.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, and, uh ...
R:  Yeah, like my husband likes sports, you know.  He will go play tennis or he'll go play soccer, you know.  That's his hobby, you know.  And cricket.  He pointed out to me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  He's listening.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, you have a speaker phone then?
R:  No, no, no, no.  I mean, he was just -- he heard my side of what I was saying.
L:  Oh, I see.
R:  'Cause he was eating dinner and I was sitting there talking.  So ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [MN]  Well, you know, I --
R:  [MN] 
L:  -- think -- I think every man should have a hobby.  Especially if it's cooking and cleaning house, but ...
R:  All right.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my God.  If only.  Oh, by the way I do like cooking as well.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I do.  I love to cook, you know.  Have -- do you like to cook?
L:  Especially if I can stick it in the microwave.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  I like trying, like, different recipes, you know.  
L:  Yeah.  I -- I think that's fun too.  I like to try different recipes too.  Usually at restaurants.  And ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, [LAUGH], oh, my God.  That is funny.  So you're not a cooker then?
L:  I'm really not much of one.  No, I -- I don't like to take a whole lot of time eating when I can do other things.
R:  Well, that's true.  That's true.  So are you a microwave, uh, hot, like, uh, frozen food par- -- type of person?
L:  A -- a microwave what?
R:  A frozen food -- frozen dinner type of person?
L:  Mm, sometimes.  Sometimes I actually open cans.  
R:  Oh, wow.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  All that expertise to use the can opener.
R:  Wow.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Wow.  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Unfortunately I have -- well, I'm not -- I guess not unfortunately but I have a family of eaters so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we need to cook.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know.  Yeah.  So -- but it's fun, like, I like to try Persian recipes and I like to try Spanish food and -- and, uh, you know, like --
L:  Well, there's a lot of recipe sites on the net.
R:  I know.  I like to visit that all recipes dot com and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know and just find, like, different recipes but I always go by the feedback.  Like if it has five stars.
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  Only then I would try it, you know.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Yeah, it's fun, you know.  But I just don't like cooking under stress.
L:  And then -- and then you also have to know, you know, which stuff you don't like.  Like let's say if you don't like spinach you don't try a new recipe with [LAUGH] spinach in it.
R:  I know.  That's true.  I love spinach though.  Oh, my God, spinach is one of my favorite vegetables.
L:  [MN]  
R:  And it's so --
L:  Well --
R:  -- healthy for you.
L:  Well, I'm glad somebody likes it.  
R:  Yes.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  You know what though?  
L:  [several inaudible words].
R:  We cook with it.  Like I -- I wouldn't eat it like plain.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, but, like, you can get, like, the fresh spinach leaves and put them in salad.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  You know, or you can get like the frozen spinach and make, like, quiche with it or ...
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mix it in with rice.  Like I cook it with rice, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it turns out so nice.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, it's -- it's fun to be creative and -- and have a hobby that you enjoy.
R:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Well, is sewing your only hobby?
L:  No, I read.  
R:  What do you like to read?
L:  Uh, sewing books.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  No, um, seriously I read just about anything.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I know, I --
L:  I'm one of these people that's a natural born speed reader and I can read a whole book in a hour.
R:  [MN]  That's awesome.  Wow.  I --
L:  And --
R:  I can read, like I -- I, well, say --
L:  I go buy a magazine at the grocery store and it takes me twenty minutes to read the whole thing and I think, "I spent forty dollars on -- four dollars on something I can only read --"
R:  Wow.
L:  "-- It takes me twenty minutes to read" you know.  
R:  Yeah, because you -- you breeze through and you only read the important parts that you like.  You know.
L:  No, I read the whole thing.
R:  I mean -- oh, how do you do that, though?
L:  I'm just a natural born speed reader.
R:  Wow.
L:  When I was in high school they clocked me.
R:  And you retain everything that you read?
L:  Yes.  Mostly I do.  Um, in fact, I can pick up a book that I read twenty years ago and read three pages and remember the whole book.
R:  Wow. 
L:  Drives me crazy.  'Cause sometimes they change the titles on books.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, uh, [LIPSMACK] but when I --
R:  I didn't think they could do that.
L:  When I was in high school I had to take a speed reading class and I came in on my first day reading faster than the machines would go.
R:  Wow.
L:  Drove my teacher nuts.  But, uh --
R:  Oh, my God.  I guess you must've done really well in school?
L:  Yeah, I did.  Didn't have any problems in school.
R:  Wow.
L:  'Specially if you had to read stuff, like, do book reports.  Oh, taken me an hour to read the book, half hour to write the book report.  [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
R:  That's great.  Wow.  
L:  And my teachers knew it only took me that long too.  
R:  Wow.
L:  So ...
R:  That -- that is pretty good.  Did you go to school too?  Like University?
L:  Pardon?
R:  You went to college as well?
L:  Yes, I went to some college.  That's correct.
R:  Oh, wow.  That's great.  That's great.  That's --
L:  So ...
R:  -- really cool.  Wow.  What else can we talk about as far as hobbies?
L:  Well, you know, I -- I think th- that it's good that people have one and I think that
