R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  This is Katie.
L:  Hi.  My name is Diane.
R:  Hi, Diane, nice to talk to you.
L:  You too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Have you done this before?
L:  Um, once before a while back.  So ...
R:  I haven't.  This is my first time.  So ...
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Um, so, yes, I think it said to talk -- talk about hobbies.
R:  Yep.
L:  Okay.  Um, actually I have a pretty interesting hobby.  I live, um -- I live near the beach and there's a beach that has, um [LIPSMACK], uh, had a old, um, uh, glass factory and they used to dump out their old glass and --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- over the years it's -- it's been tumbled in the ocean.  So, it's like these little, um, pieces of rock.  They're called sea glass.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And, um, I go out there and, um, hunt for the sea glass.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  So, they're really smooth and stuff then?
L:  Um, uh, lots of it is.  I mean, it could even be polished more but, um, yeah, it's pretty.  It's just all different colors like blue and green.
R:  How -- how big are the pieces usually?
L:  Um, uh, the biggest ones are like -- could even be like baseball size.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  I've had -- I've seen somebody get a piece that big.  But, yeah, they're mostly just like -- you know, like medium size rock size.  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] That's cool.  I can honestly say I've never heard of that before.
L:  Yeah.  So, it's -- it's pretty cool.  It's, uh -- I actually just went the last few days and -- 'cause it's, um [LIPSMACK] -- it's good to go at that particular beach at the low -- the lowest tides of the -- of the year 'cause then it exposes more of the rock.
R:  Huh.  That's neat.
L:  So --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- so it's pretty interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's -- but, uh ...  So, what type of hobbies do you have?
R:  Well, I have a [LAUGH] -- a lot actually, but they're all pretty standard and boring.  Well, not boring 'cause they're hobbies they're fun, but they're, uh -- they're pretty standard.  I do like scrap booking and, um [LIPSMACK], what else do I do?  I do -- I don't know if you've heard of, um, the refunding hobby at all.
L:  Refunding.
R:  It's like rebating and -- and, you know, sending in for rebates and stuff.
L:  Oh.
R:  I do that.
L:  Yeah.  I do that occasionally --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- [LAUGH] but probably not as a hobby.
R:  Yeah.  I do that.  And then, um, I also do -- I work fulltime, but I do, um -- I'm a Pampered Chef consultant on the side.  So, that's kind of my little hobby with that.
L:  Oh.
R:  Um, and then as far as like collecting I used to collect coins, um, when I was younger, but I haven't really collected anything.  I guess the closest I do is like whenever I go -- wherever I travel or go anywhere I'll get like a magnet for our fridge.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I kind of do that.  Um, but really, I mean, I kinda -- I -- I really like scrap booking and I really like the stuff I do because I just -- you need something to kinda take your mind off of, you know, work and [COUGH] the everyday --
L:  Right.
R:  -- everyday things and, um ...
L:  Right.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, what sorts of stuff do you put in your scrapbook?
R:  Um, mostly I just -- I just got out of school a couple of years ago.  So, mostly it was like college pictures and sorority pictures and all that, and now I'm at the point where all my friends are getting married.  So, most of my pictures are from weddings or, you know, vacation, um, things like that.  I used to take a lot more pictures just at regular social events or, you know, just whenever we went out --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and now [COUGH] I've noticed -- I got a digital camera and I've noticed that I don't take nearly as many pictures as I used to with it, which is kinda surprising.
L:  Right.
R:  But, um, I don't know if it's because I don't, um -- they can't get -- you know, it's not like they're getting developed or you just have all these pictures 'cause you only pick, you know, certain ones you like and it's kind of a hassle to print them out --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and do all that stuff like them.  But, um [LIPSMACK], yeah, I have to catch up with it actually.  I haven't done anything, um, in a while.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I still have some pictures left to put in it.
L:  [NOISE] So, how many scrapbooks do you have?
R:  Um [LAUGH], I'm looking at my shelf right now and I'm counting six.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  There's six of 'em on my shelf.  They all the way back probably about -- let's see -- there's probably about eight years worth of pictures and, um --
L:  Wow!  That's great.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm actually working on getting, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for my Mom -- she had just shoe boxes full of pictures from me and my brother growing up and so, um, I've been working over the past couple of years of getting all those to put in scrap books and, um, so there's like, you know, twenty five years of pictures that need --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- to go in and, I mean, that's been kind of a huge project.
L:  Right.  [NOISE]
R:  But, um, I'm only about a third of the way through that.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I have a bunch of photos.
R:  [LAUGH] I'll probably be working on it for a while.
L:  Well, that's what I need to do 'cause I have a bunch of photos and I just have -- I have -- don't even have most of 'em in albums.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  But yeah, I have --
R:  It's fun.
L:  -- a digital camera and a video camera.  I actually use my -- my video camera.  That I guess can be considered kind of a hobby.
R:  Yeah.
L:  When I go out to events and stuff I -- I usually take a video, a short video of something.  So, I can --
R:  I wanna get a video camera.
L:  -- put 'em on videotapes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know?
R:  They're pretty handy to have I think.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I'm trying to think if I have any other hobbies, but ...  Oh, I like to snowboard.  I don't know if that's really a hobby or just an activity but, um ...
L:  Um, yeah, that could probably be considered a hobby.
R:  [LAUGH] Would that count as a hobby?  I live in the mountains.  So, we go probably -- I don't know -- every weekend or every other weekend in the winter.
L:  Oh, wow!  Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, what mountains do you live nearby?
R:  Um, I live in Denver.  I live in the Rocky Mountains.
L:  Oh, wow!  You're like in another state.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm --
R:  Where are you?
L:  -- I'm in California near, um, Santa Cruz.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Santa Cruz basically, so ...
R:  Okay.  I grew up in, um, Bakersfield, California.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But --
L:  In the valley?
R:  -- it's not on -- just a little inland kinda ghetto, but whatever.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I'm trying to see what else.  Um ...
R:  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I -- I don't know -- work out at the gym.  That's kind of a --
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  -- I guess can consider a hobby too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I do that too.  Um ...
L:  Something to keep busy and keep you in shape and ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So that.  So ...
R:  Um, God, I'm just -- my mind's gone blank.  Um ...
L:  What -- you said something, like your third thing, something about ...
R:  Oh, I'm a -- a Pampered Chef consultant.
L:  Oh.
R:  Have you heard of the Pampered Chef?
L:  Oh, Pamper Chef, is that what it's called?
R:  Pampered.  Pampered.  Like oils.
L:  Oh, Pampered.  Oh, actually I think I just saw some, uh -- some car with that.
R:  Okay.  It's kind of -- it's a direct sales company, um, you know, like Mary Kaye or Tupperware and they sell, um, really high end kitchen products and cooking products.  Their main thing is, um, the baking stones --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- and, um, I just started doing that last year.  Um, I'm ac- -- I'm -- I'm a engineer is what I do during the day and I was sitting in my office and I'm like okay, this sucks, I need a girly job and, um, so I signed up to be a consultant and I kinda just, you know, do it on weekends and stuff.  But I've gotten a ton of free kitchen products from them and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, it's -- it's a cool thing to do, and people just love the products, they go crazy over 'em.
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.  'Cause did you have to pay to sign up with them, or you just ...?
R:  It -- you know, you do, but it's really minimal and it costs, um -- it costs ninety dollars and you get a kit that has three hundred and fifty dollars worth of products in it --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- and like all your paperwork and training material and all sorts of stuff.  So, it gets you completely set up then, um, you don't have to keep stock on hand or anything.  People just order --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- from you and then, you know, it's shipped directly from the company.  So, it's not like I have a whole closet full of, you know, baking stones or anything.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, so, it's actually a pretty low -- pretty low investment, um, and I've made -- I mean, I just do it really, really part time.  I haven't actually done a show in a while.  But I make a good like probably two hundred dollars a month extra income from it.
L:  Oh, yeah, that's not bad at all.
R:  So, yeah.  It's not bad at all and, um, you know, I -- I do it more for the -- the free products and just kinda having something fun to do, um, but a lotta people do it as a living and they do pretty well with it once you get -- you know, you climb your way up the company a bit.
L:  Yeah.  That sounds kinda interesting.
R:  Mm.
L:  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think -- I don't know how long this -- I think our calls are just supposed to be ten minutes.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Let me look here.
L:  'Cause it -- well, it took them a while to -- to find somebody I guess to -- to answer.
R:  Oh, it did?
L:  But ...
R:  Well, they called -- they called me and I [LAUGH] -- they've tried to call me like three or four times now and the -- the first call I like missed and then the second two I was doing something else.  So, I ignored 'em and then they just called me again tonight and I missed it, but I've been wanting to do it, so I had to actually call in tonight.
L:  Yeah.  So, you found it over the Internet?  That's how I found out about it.
R:  Sorry?
L:  I guess -- I -- I guess I could say that's a hobby too the Internet for me.  [LAUGH]
R:  The Internet.  Oh, God, me too.  I spend [LAUGH] -- I think I spend way too --
