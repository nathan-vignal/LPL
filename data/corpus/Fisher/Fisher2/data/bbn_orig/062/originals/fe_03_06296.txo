L:  Hi.  My name is [inaudible].
R:  Hi.  My name is Monique.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm fine.  How are you?
L:  I'm fine too.
R:  That's good.  Okay.  Now, the topic he said was, um, hobbies --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and what it was.  I'll let you go first.  So, what is your favorite hobby?
L:  Oh, I don't know.  I think I have lots of hobbies.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I like reading.  I like music.  I like, um, some sports.  I like, uh, movies.  I like the theater, things like that.  What about you?
R:  Oh, I guess my favorite I think would be, uh -- I mean, I also have a lot.  But I guess out of all my favorite would be, uh, dancing.
L:  Really?
R:  I love dancing.  It is so ...
L:  Really?
R:  Yes.  I love it.  It's so relaxing [NOISE] and, uh ...
L:  Yeah.  I can -- I can imagine.  What kind of -- what kind of dance?
R:  Well, I wanna learn how to salsa.  I wanna learn how to salsa so bad.  But I really haven't had a chance to, uh, go to a dance studio.  I have -- my daughters are in dance school, but as far as me is concerned I've never really had a chance to learn how to salsa.  But that is something that I do wanna learn because I do -- I mean, I love -- I mean, I'm really a physical person, you know, physical --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so I can dance.  I can -- I used to be on track.  I love gymnastics.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I took some salsa lessons at some point in my life, maybe a couple of years back, but I don't think -- I think you have some natural talent in order to be able to dance and I don't think I have that natural talent.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I cannot even hear the beat in, uh, salsa.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  I mean, that is something that I really -- I mean, any other kinda dancing -- like I said, I can -- I can dance, you know, any other kinda dancing, but I just -- I love salsa.  I've never really had a chance to, uh -- I can do it a little.  I'm -- I'm a quick learner when it comes to something that I like as -- you know, like dancing.
L:  Mhm.
R:  If I see someone do a dance step I can really catch on pretty quick.  So, I can dance a little bit like it --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- but not as much as I want to.
L:  Mm.
R:  As far as any other hobbies, I have two kids so ...
L:  Oh, I see.  That must limit -- that must limit the time -- time that you have available for hobbies.
R:  So, that's my hobbies for now.
L:  [NOISE]  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  My hobbies -- I mean, like I said, I -- I have when -- I tried to put my oldest in gymnastics but, uh, she doesn't really like it, you know?  She wants to be in karate.  So ...
L:  How old is she?
R:  Uh, she's seven.
L:  Mm.
R:  She'll be -- well, she'll be seven this year, but right now she's six years old.  She'll be seven on August the twentieth.
L:  Mm.
R:  And I have a four year old -- a t- three year old.  I'm sorry.  A three year old and she has a rabbit.  So, she doesn't wanna do anything, no kinda hobby.  She just -- her hobby is to play with the rabbit all day is all she likes to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] There you see.  There you see.  No, actually I have lots of time.  So, I -- I spend lots of time pursuing my hobbies.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I need to start.  I mean, with -- with two kids --
L:  I know.
R:  -- of f- -- you know, of seven and a three year old it's really -- I really have no time for me.
L:  Mm.
R:  I don't have any time for me at all.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, as far as me getting to do any hobbies I very rarely -- very rarely get a chance to do anything that I really like because they come first.  I have to do a lotta stuff for them first, but if I -- one of my major hobbies are dancing, um ...
L:  So, do you get a chance to go out in the weekend and do stuff, to go dancing?
R:  No, I don't -- no.  I don't even get a chance because -- well, I'm -- I -- I work part time --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and I'm -- I'm mar- -- really I'm trying to get back in school.  I'm trying to get my -- 'cause I was trying to become a cop.  That was something that I was really trying to do is become a cop.
L:  I see.  Yeah.
R:  But ...
L:  Yeah, that most be difficult with doing all this stuff and kids, huh?
R:  Yeah, it was too much because my schooling was for too long.  It was too long.  I -- I wouldn't -- it was for two years.  So, I just decided not to go for that --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and try something else.  [NOISE]
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...
L:  I see.  So, you're trying to get back to school again, huh?
R:  Yeah.  Well, I'm -- right now I'm gonna start going to school for, uh, nurses.
L:  Mm.
R:  I think I can probably get -- you know, get that out the way and do that.  But, uh -- but with two kids I cannot do no hobbies.  Any hobbies that I have right now would just be, uh [SIGH], I guess, uh, just taking care of them and school.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, I haven't really had a chance to get to any hobbies that I really wanna get to.  But I'm -- I'm gonna start.  I'm gonna start --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- because I think everybody needs hobbies.  I think everybody needs a little time to themselves to do something that they like.
L:  Oh, yes, I completely agree.  Keeps you sane, right?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  And happy.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, because, uh, like I said, I have two and I can't do anything that I like.  The only thing I get to do is to take care of them.  They are like my main concern.
L:  Yes.  Yes.
R:  So, I don't really have a chance to ever do anything.
L:  I can imagine.  I can imagine that -- that spending time with your kids is -- it's very playful, but you need a change from time to time, right?
R:  Yeah.  I don't have no time for myself.  So, any hobbies that I would have I don't -- I don't get to do 'em at all.
L:  Mm.
R:  At all.  My hobbies are, like I said, taking care of them.  That's -- that's all I can do. Twenty four seven.  Seven days a week.
L:  Mm.
R:  I mean, I'm not complaining but, like I said, everybody -- I think everybody does need --
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- some time for themselves, some type of hobbies that they can do, constantly do it.  I mean, I'll -- I'll start it, but I just won't never have time to finish it.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  I understand what you mean.
R:  But, um -- and that's the way I'm trying to bring them up to have some type of hobbies so they wouldn't get so bored, you know?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I see.
R:  [LAUGH] Because they'll be driving me crazy, so I have to keep them doing something.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  So, I can have a little time to myself.  But right now, like I said, besides my oldest she's in, uh, gymnastics.  My youngest I haven't had a chance [NOISE] -- I have yet, uh, to get her into something.  I think she's too young ...
L:  They're really too very young, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Your youngest child is very young.
R:  Yeah, she's three and, uh, she just turned three in February.  So ...
L:  Mm.
R:  But I'm trying ...
L:  Well, that's nice.  Well, by the time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- they are teenagers they are going to be doing all sorts of stuff, right?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Probably by the time they are teenagers you can go dancing with them.
R:  Yeah, finally.
L:  Like you could take them with you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Finally I can probably go dancing finally once they get old enough.  But for now I think I'll just, uh -- just -- once I get them into dance school and get [inaudible] to karate and stuff there's that little bit of free time that I have is good.  That fine enough, you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  I can accept that and just go with that for a while.  [NOISE]  But eventually I'll -- I'll get my dancing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I think eventually I'll get it.
L:  Mm.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes.  I guess another thing that I love to do is traveling.  I love traveling.
R:  You know what?  I do love traveling, but I haven't -- I mean, I really haven't had a chance to do as much traveling --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as I wanted to because of how times have gotten now [NOISE] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I was a little afraid of airplanes and I'm afraid of deep water.  So, I couldn't go on a cruise 'cause I'm afraid of deep water and I can't go on an airplane because I'm afraid of --
L:  airplanes.  Mm.
R:  -- airplanes, and I do drive, but I do get carsick a lot.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I think it's no justice for me.  But there are a lot of other hobbies that I'd -- I'd love to pursue, but -- well, I figure once I get them out of the way then I can go ahead and enjoy myself.
L:  Yeah.  What about music?  Music goes together with dancing well, right?
R:  Yes.
L:  Do you like music?
R:  [NOISE] I love music.  I love Michael Jackson.
L:  Mm.
R:  I'm stuck in the eighties.
L:  Mm.
R:  I love Michael.  I mean, I -- I have every C.D. he made and that's pretty much all I listen to is Michael Jackson.
L:  I see.  I still can't -- when I'm -- I'm stuck in the sixties.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, in the sixties.  [LAUGH]  In its -- okay, well, I'm a little bit above you.  I'm stuck in the seventies but, I mean, I'm -- I'm obsessed.  I love Michael and, um, my birthday just ...
L:  But he dances very well.  That you can say about him.
R:  Huh?
L:  He dances really well.
R:  Yes, he does.  Yes, he does.  I mean -- and my birthday just passed and I had, uh, asked everyone whoever gives me a gift, "Please make it something of Michael's".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I -- I got all his CDs.  The thing that I like too is some of 'em I had two of us.  But I was so happy with that.  I mean, I enjoyed it.  So -- so maybe the next time that -- when something else will come I'll ask for -- I don't know -- I already have what I really want, as I said --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- 'cause I just love anything of Michael Jackson's.  Uh, I think that was pretty good gifts.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What, uh -- what do you enjoy --
