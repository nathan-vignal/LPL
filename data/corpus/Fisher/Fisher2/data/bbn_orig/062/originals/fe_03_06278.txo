L:  Hi.  How are you?
R:  Good.  How are you?
L:  I'm okay.
R:  Where are you calling from?
L:  Um, Kentucky.  Where are you at?
R:  I'm in -- north of Tampa, Florida.
L:  Wow!
R:  So ...
L:  So, how's the weather?
R:  Oh, it's hot.  So, what are your hobbies?
L:  Uh, my hobbies are, um, crocheting, um, word games like on computer, any kind of the obscure words --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- uh, sometimes crosswords, hard crosswords; um, let's see, um, uh, making crafts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, research is one of my hobbies.  Um, I've just graduated from college and I love research.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  How much time do you spend on your hobbies?
L:  Um, well, I've had chronic fatigue syndrome and I still have it and I'm getting better, but it really depends and sometimes it allows, um -- I would say I spend about, um -- I would say I spend about twenty one hours a week --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- you know, three hours a day average.  So, what are your hobbies?
R:  My favorite hobby is scrap booking.
L:  Oh, that's one I want to get into.
R:  I do photo albums.  I started out with Creative Memories and I have nine year old twin boys and I --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- make books for them and I make books for me and my family, and I have my Mom hooked on it but, you know, it's one of these things you can't do it every day.
L:  Right.
R:  It's very time consuming and, you know, busy with the kids and work and it's just once you get started you just can't put it down.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  A lotta times I do it at night and one of the other hobbies I have, a very big hobby is refunding and couponing.  I ...
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Now, I do that.
R:  Huh?
L:  It's not a major hobby.  I do that.
R:  Do ya?
L:  Yeah.  I'm fifty, almost fifty, I'll be fifty in June and I have a son seventy seven and a daughter twenty one and they don't live at home --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm not work- -- I just graduated Saturday with a, um, degree in, um, child psychology and counseling with, um, minors in biblical studies and music.
R:  Wow!  Congratulations.
L:  Thank you.  And I haven't gone to work yet.  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I have more time to put online I guess than you do with the twin boys.
R:  Wow!  That's awesome.  Yeah, I get, um -- that's my other big hobby is coupons and bargain hunting.  I get a lot of Sunday inserts and I cut coupons and when there is a sale I'm out there, I mean, I study the papers.
L:  Right.
R:  So, that's like my second biggest hobby, trying to save money and get bargains.
L:  Well, I guess with -- also, um, you know, I -- I feel that with just the two of us is if any coupons that -- what we like or what we like to try, um, kinda use all that I can get a hold of, get 'em off the Internet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Have you tried getting them off the Internet?
R:  Yes.
L:  I've found some real good ones.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Like two dollars off, five dollars off, ten dollars off different things.
R:  Wow!  Do you just like -- well, how do ya -- how do ya find them?  You read ...?
L:  Well, I get -- I subscribe to different free stuff, newsletters from different peop- and a lotta times they'll be on links and that and the newsletters --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and yet sometimes you -- you know, you won't find them every week.
R:  Now, you're not a subscriber of R. -- R.M.C. are ya?
L:  Of what?
R:  The magazine R.M.C., Refunding Makes Sense?
L:  No.
R:  Oh, okay.  That's a good -- that's a big, um, magazine or a website, but you have to subscribe to it and they --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- it gets you a lot of, um, you know, the ideas and where to get -- find bargains and where to get coupons and -- on the Internet and ...
L:  Now, how old are you?
R:  I'm thirty nine.
L:  Oh, so you're young.  But still those twin boys.  [LAUGH]  That's -- so you just have the two boys?
R:  Oh, yes.  That's more than enough.
L:  [LAUGH] Are they ...?
R:  I would say that's my third hobby.  It takes most of my time.
L:  Right.  Is your boys.
R:  Yep.
L:  Right.
R:  It's just, you know, driving them around to all their --
L:  Right.
R:  -- sports and cub scouts and piano and it just takes so much time.
L:  Right.  But, um, you know, really everybody tell me I would have emptiness syndrome, but [LAUGH] I don't have it.  I've enjoyed time to myself and with my husband.  I love my kids, but when they left, you know, it's -- my son's gonna be coming home this fall to live and he's really good --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- and I'm looking forward to that but, you know, we -- we really enjoyed it --
R:  Uh-huh.  So --
L:  -- our time.
R:  -- you haven't done any scrap booking?
L:  Not yet.
R:  Okay.
L:  That's one thing I'd like to start.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, um, um, I've been looking into that, but I would like to.
R:  Yes.  There's so much stuff out that you can get, you know, at Michael's or all these hobby stores that -- even Wool Mart --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you can get a lotta scrap booking stuff.
L:  We have a scrap booking store here.  We're a small town, but we have one.
R:  Oh, do ya?
L:  I haven't been in it.  I don't know how expensive -- I'd like to probably start getting some of the free templates and stuff off the Internet and go into Wool Mart.
R:  Yeah, 'cause those scrap booking stores are kinda expensive.
L:  Right. 
R:  So, you can get the stuff, um, you know, cheaper at Wool Mart or with forty percent off coupons at Michael's.  You know, you just gotta watch ...
L:  Now, what is Michael's?  I don't think we have one.
R:  Oh, you don't have Michael's?
L:  I don't think we have one in.  Um, Paducah we have Hobby Lobby.
R:  Oh, it's kinda like a -- do you have Frank's?
L:  No.  Are you familiar with Hobby Lobby?
R:  Yeah.  It's kinda like Hobby Lobby.  It's, um ...
L:  Is it?
R:  Yeah.  It's a -- it's a craft store and they have usually forty percent off coupons in the Sunday papers every week.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yes.
L:  Well, you can get -- well, if I decided to go to Paducah, which is about forty five minutes away --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- I could, um, get, um, um -- we got -- you can get, um, coupons off the Internet for them each month.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  Yeah, for so much discount.  So, um -- but, uh, I don't know.  I don't know where to start.
R:  Well, you just kinda like, you know, get like -- or if you travel or just pick like one big subject or if you have a party, a birthday party or just, you know, something just grab some pictures, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  And there's idea books that you can purchase that gives you ideas, you know, how to do, how to put it together.
L:  I'll probably this year my imag- uh, imagination on and --
R:  Yeah. That's ...
L:  -- so I do -- I -- I like to be creative.
R:  Yeah, and then just kinda like start putting them together, use a lotta, you know, um ...
L:  Now, what got you started to it, having twins or ...?
R:  Um, I think that kind of -- that's when I started, yeah, just because I wanted to do, you know, just not the basic photo albums --
L:  Right.
R:  -- where you just sticking in their pictures.  I wanted it to look different, you know, just -- and, you know, so I looked around and I actually got started with Creative Memories, which is like parties, like Tupperware or, you know, that you go to -- go to peoples' houses --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and have parties and buy it.  So, I started out with them.  But that's kind of expensive too and now, you know, it got so popular that you could buy it almost in every store and get the stuff cheaper.  But that's where I got my ideas and I just love doing it and I, um -- I just wish I had more time to do it.  But ...
L:  How old did you say your boys were?
R:  They just turned nine.
L:  Nine.  Hey, it's gonna be a while --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that you have more time on your hands, huh?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  And you work?
R:  Um, right now I just volunteer a lot at their school.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  I'm there just about every day.  I'm trying to get away from that and get a real job again.  [LAUGH]  But I really just love to be at their school and help out and volunteer.  I see what they do and just ...
L:  That's a -- well, I guess you might -- if that's a hobby or what that is, but that's -- you've -- you've got a lotta activities in your life, don't you?
R:  Oh, yes, I feel like, you know, I'm never at home and my husband was recalled in the military so he's gone right now.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, we're just, um, always going, going, going.
L:  Now, where is he at?
R:  Um, he's -- he was just deployed, uh, for a couple of weeks.
L:  Oh, he's overseas or in the United States?
R:  Uh, he's in the United States.
L:  Oh, well, that's not -- maybe not as bad.  Is he gonna have to go overseas?
R:  Uh, I'm not sure.
L:  [NOISE] Well, I guess that's ...
R:  We don't know yet.
L:  You just have to handle it the best you can.
R:  Oh, yes, there's --
L:  How long ...?
R:  -- nothing you can do about it.
L:  Right.  Um, so, um, you just -- it's, um -- you know, you -- it sounds like you're doing good.  Just try not to stress yourself out.  Here I sound like the counselor here --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and take care of yourself.
R:  Oh, no, things are going good, you know, I don't think we have anything to complain.  There's other people that are a lot, you know, worse --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and, you know, you just gotta stay positive and think the best.
L:  Have you ever done any needle hobbies like crocheting and knitting?
R:  Actually I have, you know, when I was young and I grew up -- I grew up in Germany.  It was really big in my, um --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- my family.  My sister used to knit a lot.  I didn't do as much as her, but I did do some knitting.
L:  Now, are you German?
R:  Yes.
L:  That's what it sounds from the accent a little bit maybe.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.  But a lotta times Americans will, you know, hover on the same kinda accent.  That's cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, how do you find America compared to Germany?
R:  Oh, I've been here so many years now, you know, it's, um -- it's -- it's different.  But, you know, I go back and visit and I get a lotta company visiting.
L:  Well, I never got to visit Germany.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I've been to Europe, but I've never been to Germany.
R:  Mm.
L:  So --
