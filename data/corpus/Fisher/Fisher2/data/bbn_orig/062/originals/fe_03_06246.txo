R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  Hello.  This is Elizabeth.
R:  This is Julie.
L:  Hi, Julie.
R:  Hi.  Where you from?
L:  I'm from Burlington, North Carolina.
R:  I'm in Smith Station, Alabama.
L:  Oh, okay.  Alabama?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Well, I can tell you one of my hobbies is watching American Idol.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I don't watch that.
L:  [MN]
R:  Um, I guess my hobbies are I like to do mystery shopping.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do, um, coupons.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Lots of those.  Um, computers.
L:  Computers?
R:  Yeah.  I like -- well, Internet.  I like to be on the computer a lot.
L:  Right.  Well, that's a -- that's another hobby of mine.  I -- I do mystery shopping as well and I do that mostly for fun, some of that for work, but it -- I do it because it's fun.
R:  I do it for fun too 'cause I work fulltime.
L:  Oh, yeah?
R:  Yeah.  I just ...
L:  I do too.
R:  I'm a dispatcher.
L:  Oh, really?  That's great.
R:  For the milit- -- I work for the military.  Um, I was in the army for twenty two years.  So ...
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That's great.  Um, well, let's see.  The other hobbies that I have -- I mean, I have a family.  So, I don't have a whole lotta time to spend, um ...
R:  I know how that is.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I don't have a lotta time to spend on myself.  I -- sometimes I find myself encouraging them to participate in things that I enjoy just because, you know, it's the things I like and that's the way I get to enjoy them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, like baseball.  My -- my son and my husband both play baseball and both of the kids play soccer.  So, I guess one of my hobbies would be not necessarily playing sports but watching sports.
R:  Watching sports.  How old are ya kids?
L:  They're both eleven.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  Twins?
L:  No, they're not twins.  One is my, uh, stepdaughter.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, they're six months apart.  So, it's, uh -- it's pretty interesting, but, um ...  Yeah.  So ...  And we like computers too.  My husband is very involved in -- in computers.  He likes to actually build computers and sell them.
R:  Oh, I wish I knew somebody that could do that.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, he's pretty much taught himself.  He doesn't -- he does that as his hobby.  He doesn't do it for a living, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- but he really enjoys -- like, he's got message boards that he likes to talk on and, um -- or, you know, exchange ideas with -- with people and, um, just build very unique computers -- computers that look unique even, you know --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, um, sort of build on kind of like the Dell system.
R:  That's kinda interesting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That -- I -- I just like to play around on the Internet mostly, but I don't do it as much as I used to.  It takes -- it gets time consuming.
L:  Oh, yeah?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  It does and the kids always wanna interrupt and ...  [LAUGH]
R:  And ...
L:  Now, do you have kids?
R:  Yeah.  But mine are older.  One's seventeen, he graduates this Friday, and the other one's nineteen and he's in college. 
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's great.  That's great news.  So, you're almost gonna have more time for yourself now?
R:  Yeah.  I will pretty soon.
L:  And what are ya doing then?  Are you gonna take up more hobbies or ...?
R:  I might -- I -- I like the mystery shopping.  I might try to get a few more of those jobs 'cause right now I just do ones that I can do like on my home from work.
L:  Right.
R:  I can stop here and -- or fast food because my kids like fast food.  I can take it home to them what I don't eat.
L:  Right.  Right.  Uh, the reason I said that about watching American Idol is because it's on tonight and the guy Rueben, you know, is from Alabama.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, one of the ...
R:  I've never watched that.  So, they're down to the last two though, aren't they?
L:  The last two and one of them is from Alabama.  So, that -- when you said that's why I said I liked it.  So, that's -- I guess that would be another, um, thing that I like to do.  I don't watch a lotta T.V., but when I do it -- it's, um, reality T.V. shows.  I like to watch those.
R:  Oh.  You know, last time I got called by this company it was a -- that was the topic, reality shows, and I don't really watch those shows.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it was hard to talk for ten minutes about them 'cause I don't watch them and neither do my partner, neither one of us watch them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God!  No, mine was about, um, the war and we had to, um -- we had different views.  So, it was a very interesting ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I could talk for ten min- -- 'cause I was in the army for so long I could talk easily on the war.
L:  That's right.  That's right.  Well, we still got a little ways to talk about, huh?  Let's see, what else can we say though?
R:  I'm not timing it.  I figured last time they came on they just said your ten minutes is up.  So --
L:  Mhm.  Okay.
R:  -- I figure they gonna come on and say that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I hope so.  [LAUGH]
L:  We've been talking about five minutes I guess.  We've got a few more minutes.  Um ...
R:  And what part of North Carolina did you say you're from?
L:  Burlington.  It's between Greensborough and Durham.
R:  [MN]
L:  And, uh, it's a great place to live as far as you talking about you like to mystery shop and -- and, of course, I -- I do that too.  That's how I heard about this study.
R:  Me too.  That's why I figured you probably did it too 'cause that's where most the people heard about this.
L:  Right.  And I tell ya it's -- it's become sort of a hobby for my family because, you know, we -- I look for -- I look for jobs that I can do that would either benefit my family or be of enjoyment --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and, um [LIPSMACK], that being like, um -- choosing restaurants, you know, that we all like to go.
R:  And even if you don't get paid everything it's still, uh -- at least it makes it affordable.
L:  That's right.  Exactly.  Well, we get to eat out a lot more than we used to and -- and those are things that we couldn't necessarily do, you know, freely before.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And now it's -- it's a lot easier.  We're a lot more free to do that.  Plus I get a little bit of extra money.  So, if I wanna go buy something for myself --
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know?  So, it's -- you know, all in all it's -- it's a great, um, hobby to -- to have, to get involved in.
R:  And how did you get started in it?  Did you have a friend or somebody?
L:  Actually I did.  I had a friend, um, and she and I were talking about, you know, just different ways to -- to, um, make extra money and -- and she was already involved in it and told me a little bit.  So, I started doing the research and have just, um [LIPSMACK], you know, pretty much following message boards and things like that, um ...
R:  Oh, that -- that's basically what I did, but I didn't know anybody that was in it.  I just found it on the Internet one day --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and said, oh, that looks interesting.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And surprisingly I hear on the message boards a lotta people say, "I didn't get paid by this company".  I've been paid for every single shop I've done for every company.
L:  I -- I have too.  I have too.  I've been fortunate.  I've only had one or two that I had to call, but as soon as I called them, you know, my -- my payment was in the mail.
R:  I don't think I've even had to call anybody, but I don't post on the message boards either.  I just walk in.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I feel a lot of --
L:  I do the same thing.
R:  -- I feel a lotta people complain, "Oh, they didn't pay me for this".  They -- some of them I don't think -- just don't wait long enough.
L:  Mhm.  Well, you know, it's when they start getting like that on the message boards that it starts to be not so much fun anymore.
R:  Yeah.  What I look at and for is hints.  Who got this job?  Who got this job?  [LAUGH]  So, I know who to -- 'cause I don't wanna sign up for a million companies.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I just try -- and in fact that's one thing that helped me out a lot is I found somebody in Alabama, they live on the other side of Alabama, and I emailed her when I saw her on the message board from Alabama and I told her I was just starting out and could she give me some hints to what companies shop Alabama --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and she did and that -- and those were the only companies I registered with.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  I won't ...
L:  Well, you work fulltime so you probably don't have a whole lotta time to go around and do 'em --
R:  No, I don't.
L:  -- you know, working with a lotta different companies.
R:  I just try to do a couple a week on my home --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and stuff like that.
L:  Well, that's good.  That's ...
R:  But you get the regular companies, you get the regular jobs.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.  There are a few of them.  Once you get signed up with them you can get, you know, pretty consistent [COUGH] -- pretty consistent work with them.
R:  Yeah, and -- and even the ones that say you never get nothing off the sassy sites, I get -- get 'em off here and I don't even -- I guess they keep picking the same people.
L:  [LAUGH] Maybe so.
R:  If you meet the rotation I guess they just pick you again --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I don't have -- well, a couple of companies I've never got picked from but ...
L:  Well, maybe you got -- don't have a lotta people in your area either --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that ...
R:  I don't -- I don't think there's that many in the area 'cause there's not that many shops in the area.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  Well, I've been fortunate.  I -- I live in an area, um, between two or three fairly decent size towns, um, I live in Burlington and that is a college town and, um, because we have Elon University here and then there's Greensborough on one side and it's pretty popular, it's a pretty big city, and then we've got Rawley Durham on the other.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, everything through here is pretty busy and I don't --
R:  So, you don't ...?
L:  -- and I don't the market's really saturated with shoppers because I've been fortunate enough to get a lot of what I've, you know, applied for.
R:  Are you gonna try to go to one of those M.S.P.A. ...?
L:  Well, I was hoping to get to the one that's next month in Rawley, but they just announced it and I've got a dinner job scheduled for that day.  So, if I can get out of the dinner I'm gonna try to go.
R:  I'm gonna try to go to the one in Atlanta when they come down here.
L:  Mm.  Yeah.  Do you live close to Atlanta?
R:  Yeah.  I'm right on the Alabama Georgia border, actually --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- Columbus is my main shopping area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  What ...?
L:  Oh, I love it.
