L:  -- and they have, um, like free after rebate items, like if you buy a certain type of toothpaste then you can send in the receipt and the U.P.C. code and you get that price back.
R:  Huh.
L:  So, I do that for Eckerd's, I do it for Walgreen's --

R:  Cool.
L:  And then, um --
R:  That's awesome.
L:  -- a lotta different things like that.  It's -- it's just a -- a -- a good hobby.  I've been doing it for about ten years --
R:  Huh.
L:  -- and, uh, I -- I really enjoy it.
R:  Cool.  Um, so -- so how -- do you like have to keep a tally on how much you like kinda save or ...?  [MN]
L:  Well, the booklet that you get it has, um, a tally in it.
R:  Oh.
L:  It tells what product you get and how much rebate you get on it --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and you just put the number beside it and you -- and you just circle your, uh, cash register receipt --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and you send it all in together --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, uh, uh, usually mine's like anywhere between five to ten dollars a month.
R:  Oh, well, that's fun.
L:  It's what -- you know, it's what I get back on 'em.
R:  Yeah, that's fun.
L:  And then I put it in -- I put it in a special savings account -- or checking account really --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then my husband and I [NOISE] we always go to -- to Bakers on our anniversary.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?
L:  I mean ...
R:  Like for a year?
L:  For a year, every year we go.
R:  Oh, my gosh.
L:  I don't make that -- you know, enough to cover the trip.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But -- but whatever I make, you know, it helps.
R:  Yeah.  Well, that's fun.
L:  So, about you?
R:  Well, I'm a singer and so I sing.
L:  All right.
R:  I, um -- I practice.  I have voice lessons --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that I have on tape 'cause I had a voice teacher a while ago --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, then I had to move out of the area.  So, I kept all of her voice lessons on tape and I still use 'em --
L:  All right.
R:  -- and, um, I, uh -- sometimes I just like to put in my favorite songs and sing.
L:  What kind of music?
R:  Um, you know, I like all kinds of music, um [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I like almost everything.
L:  I do too.
R:  Yeah.  So, I like -- but I like, uh, classic, rock, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and I also like -- like soft rock, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- seventies and eighties.
L:  Yeah.  My daughter in law sings too --
R:  Oh, yeah. 
L:  -- and, uh, she -- she's, uh, in the process of getting a band together and everything now --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- and, uh, she -- she just -- that's -- she -- that's why I have the grand babies tonight.  So, that's what she's doing tonight and she's on her way to pick 'em up.  But, um, she sings too and she -- she really loves it.  She -- she's got a beautiful voice.  She plays the guitar --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, uh, she -- the music she sings I'm not really into.  It's more like a, um -- a blues, um [LIPSMACK] -- kinda like a blues rock or --
R:  Kinda like --
L:  -- I don't know what you would call it.
R:  -- Wynona Ryder or something or ...?
L:  No.  I -- I can ...
R:  Wynona Judd or something?
L:  No, um, it's not a country --
R:  No?
L:  -- um ...
R:  Hm.
L:  I can't think of what type of music she calls it.
R:  Well, blues.
L:  But it's -- it's kinda like a blues type of music.  Yeah.  And she's ...
R:  That's good bar music though.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she's got a beautiful voice.
R:  Yeah, that's great.
L:  But I'm just -- I'm just not into that type of music.  I like more like a -- a soft country or something like that, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
L:  I live in Florida.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, that's a good market there for music.
L:  Yeah.  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Los Angeles --
L:  Oh, right.
R:  -- and -- and I've ...
L:  California and Florida, huh?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yep.  And -- and I have sung with many bands as well and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's a lot of fun though.
L:  Well, good.
R:  It's really great.  Yeah.  It's hard to keep 'em to the other but, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- it's a lotta fun.  I'M actually gonna meet a guy tonight that I'm going to [LAUGH] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- hopefully sing on some of his music that he does, and he does like club music and stuff --
L:  Oh, right.  Great.
R:  -- like house music.  So, we'll see.
L:  As long as you enjoy it.
R:  Yeah.  It's cool --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- and I don't know if I really call that -- I don't know if that's necessarily a hobby 'cause I -- I have made my living out of it.
L:  Right.
R:  Does that count as a hobby?  [LAUGH]
L:  Well we could consider it one.
R:  I guess I do it 'cause I like it.
L:  We could -- could consider it a hobby.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Actually I can maybe say that maybe my new hobby is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I have this great stuff.  I -- they probably have it out in California or in Florida too --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but there's a lot of hot springs in California --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so I like to if I have a day off go to, um, some hot springs.
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  It's just like there's a river or some water coming up from the ground and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- somebody's made a little pool and, uh, we like to go there and hang out for the day.
L:  All right.
R:  It's awesome.  Yeah.
L:  That sounds nice.
R:  Yeah.  They're really nice and they're all over the west coast.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They're probably -- probably a lot in Florida though too.
L:  Yeah, there's a few.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I was looking at a book on it or something.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But, man, it's -- it's a -- just a great way to spend a day.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah, I guess it is.  Yeah.
R:  It's very cool.  Yeah.  So, what else do you -- do you have any other hobbies?
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], I'm trying to think what -- well, I like to, uh, paint.  I do, uh, some painting like on clothes and stuff.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.  I do some things like that.
R:  Um, you know, I like to paint too.  Did you, um, take classes, or what do you do?
L:  No, uh, I didn't take a class, but I used to buy these Trichem paints.
R:  Mhm.
L:  The -- the name of it is Trichem and it's a company and they had these different paints that, uh -- different colors that you can get and they had these things that you can iron on tee shirts and things like that and paint 'em in --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and I've made quilts and, um --
R:  Neat.
L:  -- I've made a quilt for my Mom and for my couple of sisters I made out of, uh, painting the squares, you know?
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I -- I did that and ...
R:  And does, um -- does the paint stay on good and does the ...?
L:  Yes, it does.  Yes, wash --
R:  It doesn't like ...?
L:  -- it -- it doesn't wash off --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, I mean, it'll stay on for years.
R:  Can I get it in like an art store?
L:  Yeah, you can.  Mhm.
R:  Gosh, you know, maybe I could do that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause I'm not exactly like the best artist --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but I wanna start painting and stuff.
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  That'd be cool.  [LIPSMACK]  So, it's called Trichem?
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that sounds interesting.
L:  And they do have it in the stores, in any store, anything.
R:  Like, uh, Michael's?  We have Michael's out here.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's a ...
L:  We have a Michael's here too.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  It's a craft store.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's kind of expensive, but --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- if you can get a couple of things it's cool.
L:  Yeah.  Well, I know in our paper here on a -- on the Sunday papers they have, uh, where you, uh -- coupons that you can cut out of the paper --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- for Michael's that you can get forty percent off on one item.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  So, you know, something like that helps because then you can go get one a week or whatever, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and get forty percent off of it.
R:  Oh, well, that's cool.
L:  And that -- you know, that helps.
R:  Every week they have that?
L:  Uh, normally every week they do here, yeah.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is it just the regular paper, or is it like a special bargain paper?
L:  No, it's a regular newspaper --
R:  Oh.  I'll make sure I get that.
L:  -- and they have it in usually -- every Sunday paper they have it in it and, um, then you just cut it out and take it up there and -- and whatever regular priced item that you get -- you get forty percent off.  [COUGH]
R:  [MN] Well, that's pretty cool.
L:  Yeah.  And if you do that every week then, you know, normally you stock up on 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, exactly.
L:  [COUGH] But that helps.
R:  Well, that's interesting.
L:  But that's -- you know, that's a big part of my hobby right there is doing things like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Saving money.  I get on the Internet and -- and find coupons and --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- different things like that and ...
R:  They have a couple of good website for stuff like that.
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I know.  I really enjoy it.  It's something I really enjoy doing.
R:  So, you surf the web?  That's cool.
L:  Ma'am?
R:  You surf the web?
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.
R:  That's what they call it, you know, when you're --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- looking around.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I do too.
L:  Yeah, I do that.
R:  That's cool.
L:  I -- I usually got on there for an hour or so and then I'll eat and then on the weekend if I'm not working then I do -- you know, get on it for a while.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  But ...
R:  So, uh, is that how you found this company through the paper, huh?
L:  No, this one I found through -- off the Internet.
R:  Oh.
L:  Off of some of my friends off the Internet.
R:  Oh, that's cool.
L:  Yeah.  How did you find it?
R:  Through the paper.
L:  Through the paper?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Hm.
R:  I saw I ad that said something, "Do you wanna talk on the phone?"  [LAUGH]
L:  Was this the first time you've did it or ...?
R:  Um, this is like -- this is like the, uh, second call I've done.  So ...
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But ...
L:  What -- do you, uh, reali- understand how you get paid for this, or what?
R:  Um, apparently when I -- you know what?  I think I did have to go on the Internet to fill everything out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Did you do that?
L:  I did and I was supposed to get a number back, a pin number or something --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I never got one.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I don't even know -- you know, I don't even know what's going on with it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, how long have you been doing it?
L:  This is the second one.
R:  Oh, yeah, me too.  Um, so that would be the third week 'cause I missed it last week.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I don't know.  To be honest I haven't been paid yet either.  So, maybe [LAUGH] -- who knows?
L:  Yeah, I haven't neither, but did they send you an email and -- with a pin number or whatever?
R:  Um, you know what?  I think that I did have something and I printed it out so that I would save it --
L:  [NOISE] Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I really can't remember where I put it, but it's probably in my p- -- my stuff with all my bills.  So, I have a copy of it somewhere.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm gonna have to figure out something to, you know, get in touch with them and find out what about a pin number --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because, um, I don't even know what a pin number is.  [LAUGH]  I mean, I -- I know what a pin number is, but I didn't get one.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I don't know.
R:  Yeah.  I don't either.
L:  Sounds weird.
R:  That's pretty crazy.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.
L:  So, you're gonna meet with somebody tonight and -- and, um ...?
R:  Yeah.  It's, um -- I just got a job working at this, um, realty company and, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- this woman was leaving and they were joking me that I was supposed to sing for them on the day that she was gonna leave, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- 'cause everybody was gonna get together.  So, when it came the day they were all like, "Come on, sing for us.  Sing for us".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I sang a song.  I sang Me and Bobby McGee and the girl, um --
L:  Oh, I love that song.
R:  -- that was --
