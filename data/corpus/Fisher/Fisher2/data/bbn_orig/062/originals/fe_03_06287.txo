L:  Hi, I'm Mary-Grace.
R:  Hi, I'm Julie.  [PAUSE]  Are we supposed to start talking now?  [LAUGH]
L:  I was just gonna say that.  I guess we are.  I don't know.  I guess, um, we're supposed to discuss hobbies.  Did it -- did it tell you what the topic was?
R:  Um, they said hobbies.
L:  Yeah, and whether or not -- what are hobbies were, how much time we spend, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- doing them, and whether we thought each person had a hobby or not.
R:  Right.
L:  Okay.  Um, let's see, um, my hobbies would be well, being on the computer, um, and I spend way too much time doing that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Um, like, I mean, I read all different things on the computer though, like I do all different kinds of searches for different information --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and then plus I play games and I go to some online group -- support groups.  So -- so, I would say I spend over twenty five to thirty hours, even more, a week on the computer just doing that.
R:  I enter sweepstakes on the computer.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Ah.
R:  And I probably spend twenty five to thirty hours a week doing that.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, have -- have you won?  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I won a trip to New York.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L: Wow!
R:  And I won a trip to North Carolina.
L:  Hey, that's where I am.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So, um, I participated in a shoot out at the men's A.C.C. basketball tournament --
L:  Oh!
R:  -- [LAUGH] for a million dollars, but I didn't win.
L:  Oh, you were in that.  Oh, that's -- that -- I live in Raleigh.  So ...
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, this was last year.  I did this last year.
L:  Oh!
R:  So ...
L:  Wow!  I, um -- let's see what else, um, well, I love to read too, um, I read, um, the Bible, I read magazines, I read books, I'm always reading, and listening to music.  I would say I listen to music the most next to the computer and that's whenever I don't have -- I mean, I -- whenever -- I'll -- I'll have the music on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- almost all the time.  So ...
R:  Um, I read People magazine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, yeah.  I love People magazine.  I mean, I have a subscription to Oprah.  So ...
R:  Nah, I've never read that magazine.
L:  Oh, it's pretty good.  Um, but I love -- I get People and, um, uh, Premier magazine and, um, I got -- I got People, Premier and Entertainment Weekly for free for a while.  So, I was listening to -- I mean, I was reading those, uh, um ...
R:  Have you ever subscribed to a magazine, um -- there's a site online -- I can't think what it is -- but most of them are like two ninety five for a year?
L:  Oh.
R:  And I got Us magazine.  Have you ever heard of it?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  It's sort of like People.
L:  Yeah, and it's like Entertainment Weekly.  Yeah.
R:  Okay.  Well, I received it, uh, for two ninety five a year --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- which that's really good.  I wish they would do that with People.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you can never get People in those special deals normally.  It's always hard but, um -- but anyhow I love to swim and I love to walk.  Um, swimming I do more of, of course, in the summer.  Even though I live in North Carolina and it's hot here we are so like other places and our pool opens on Memorial Day and closes on Labor Day and it cracks me up.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm like, um, I moved to the south so I could have a longer amount of time!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like I could've got that in New Jersey where I used to live.  So ...  But I don't -- I can't think of any other hobbies I really do.  Oh, I do beading.  Sometimes I make, um, bracelets.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I do that, but ...
R:  I am not a crafty person at all.  [LAUGH]  I can't make anything.
L:  Well, I'm not crafty but, um -- but you don't have to be for beads 'cause you just string them.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, that's the best part of that.
R:  Well, I have five children.  So, my, um [LAUGH] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- time is kinda limited to that.
L:  Yep.  There would be limited time for sure.
R:  I do the computer like when they're watching their T.V. shows --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and then after I put them to bed at night and stuff.
L:  Yeah.  Um, what else?  I've been, um -- I just got -- I do mystery shopping.
R:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]  Now, I've read about that, like in my refunding magazine I get.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I've never done that.  Of course, I live in the country and there's not much opportunity for that.
L:  Right.  Well, I've been do- -- I've been doing that and the one that -- the way that I got on to it was, um, through a -- a subscription that you had to pay for.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But you don't have to pay and I found that out of course after I'd already paid, and now I've found out there's one like driving for dollars.
R:  Mm.
L:  But the one that I found so far is only a paid service.  So, I'm like real hesitant 'cause now that I know I could've gotten the mystery shopping for free I keep -- now I'm trying to find on the Internet the, um -- the other for free, the driving for free.
R:  Have you ever went to --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Refund Sense dot com?
L:  Refund what?
R:  Refund Sense dot com.
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  There's several listed there.  At least there used to be.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, check that out --
L:  I will.
R:  -- because a lotta people there do the mystery shopping and they list --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the different places to sign up.
L:  Oh, well, that would be -- 'cause, uh, the mystery shopping I've been having a blast with 'cause I'm on disability.  So, um -- so that's been really helpful and it just gives you something to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, I don't know.  Do I think -- do I think everybody has hobbies?  I don't know.  I would think everyone thinks they have hobbies anyway.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like ...
R:  Yeah.  I -- I think so too, um ...
L:  Yeah, I'm just not sure that they ...
R:  That they realize they're a hobby?  [LAUGH]
L:  Or that they partake in 'em as much.
R:  Mm.  Right.
L:  Yeah.  Anymore like they used to or, you know, when they first started because I remember I used to love to do ceramics, but then I lost interest and, um -- and plus I'm not very like artistic.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  That's me too.  Now, I'm into NASCAR.  That's a hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Do you go to any races, or anything like that?
L:  Um, I haven't.  Uh-uh.  I've never been.  This past weekend I had a chance -- or almost had a chance to go to Winston Town for the Winston Cup, but -- the Winston races, but I didn't -- it didn't happen.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I won tickets for the race this weekend to, uh, Charlotte, but I sold them because it was just a little bit too far for us to drive.
L:  Oh.
R:  Oh, well, but I could've gone.
L:  But -- and -- and you were saying that you won a, um ...?
R:  I won the tickets to go.  I didn't win --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, no transportation or anything was included, just --
L:  Right.
R:  -- just the tickets.  So, I put those on eBay.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, really?  See, now -- see, I -- my friend just sells -- like that's one of her hobbies is selling a lot of stuff on eBay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She does that.
R:  I think a lotta people do that.  Um, well, my best friend's Mom she does it and she'll do it for other people and charge a commission.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  She takes care of everything --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, she shifted off and everything, but she charges I think twenty five percent --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- of whatever she sells it for.
L:  Right.  Well, yeah, I have a friend who was, um, trying to sell some things on -- she was asking what was that was about, like how you do that, and I was like, "Oh, well, I guess we'll get up and figure it out".  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I can't use a digital camera and a lotta things, you know, people wanna see pictures of stuff and --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I have a digital camera.  I can put it on the computer, but once the picture is on the computer I can't do anything with it --
L:  Oh. 
R:  -- and I don't have the patience to figure it out.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, must be me -- that would be [inaudible].
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I would have -- that's how I would take it.  I would have to do that that way 'cause once somebody like does that like -- I mean -- and I do that even with -- like something like a hobby like -- like the beads because I said I wasn't crafty --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- this one time I sat down and I was like I'm making this bracelet.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm -- and so I sat and watched this person make it just so I could figure out how to do it, so that I could say, "Well, I at least can make a bracelet".  So, I was determined that I was gonna do that, but ...  So, as soon as someone tells me no to something then it becomes I have to learn it.
R:  [LAUGH] It's a mission.
L:  Yeah.  But ...
R:  Um ...
L:  Man, there must be -- like if you, um -- have you ever gone to Clever -- I'm trying to think of this one that has a whole bunch of food stamps.  I can't think of the name of it anymore.  It's Clever something.  Clever Quick Store.[?]
R:  No, I've never heard of that.
L:  Ah.  Yeah, 'cause they have some sweepstakes on there and trivia.  There's Win Trivia dot com.  I never win that though.  I get high scores on the trivia, but I never win their daily sweepstake.  But --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- that would be cool to do that.  Um, I used to like to book -- like when I was in New Jersey, um -- had, um, boating.  That was fun.
