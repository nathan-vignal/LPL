L:  Hi, Doreen.
R:  Hi.  Where ya calling from?
L:  I'm from Utah.
R:  Oh, okay.  I'm in Michigan.
L:  Oh, great.  I think the last person I talked to was in Michigan or Wisconsin.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, we're -- yeah, we're not too far.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's great.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, what do you like to do for your hobbies?
R:  Um, I, um, do couponing and rebating, you know, things like -- trying to, you know, save money by --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- collecting coupons and sending in for rebates for movie tickets and for prod- -- you know, like little doodads and things like that.
L:  Huh.  How do you do that?  Just through newspapers?
R:  Um, just -- yeah, the Sunday paper has a lot of 'em and I belong to a couple of, um, websites --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- that like people post, you know, oh, this -- you can get this forum or you, you know, look for these products and send in and get this and that, and just by looking at the boxes a lotta times the forum will be, you know, like part of the packaging of the -- on the carton.
L:  Uh-huh.  So, is this a s- subscription that you pay on the websites or ...?
R:  Yes, because it's all a website and then this particular -- it's called Refunding Makes Sense, um, it's a -- she sends out, um [LIPSMACK], a book, um, magazine every month also.
L:  Huh.  So, you really feel it's worth it?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.
R:  Yeah.  I save a lotta money.
L:  Huh.
R:  And like today, um -- yesterday or last week they had posted, uh, between two and four today at all Starbucks if you went in they were giving out free samples of a new, um, um, mocha -- cappuccino or something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were giving away free glasses.   So, I happened to be out running errands and was near two of 'em and they're like very nice, um, glass -- parfait glasses --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they were just giving 'em away.
L:  Huh.
R:  But I would've never known.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And they posted a couple of weeks ago, you know, that Bask N. Robbins is giving away a free scoop of ice cream on whatever day it was, you know, just -- they do it once a year.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, we went, me and the four kids and my husband, and we all got a free ice -- scoop of ice cream.
L:  Huh.  That's cool.  I actually just finished putting together my grocery list.  [LAUGH]
R:  All right.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I recently tried that thing where, um -- in the weekly newspaper they have the ads and things.  So, I tried that and, um, stopped getting the newspaper.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- not do that anymore.  But ...
R:  What are your hobbies?
L:  I love jogging.
R:  Okay.
L:  So, I would say that that was -- that's probably my biggest hobby and I jog about three hours a week and then -- then I go to the gym for about an hour too.
R:  Okay.  So, you like working out also?
L:  Yeah, I love it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I wish I did more.  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I just love how it makes me feel afterward.  I never -- before I -- I went to college I really wasn't into it, but after my sophomore year I just kind of got thrown into it and hated it at first and after I'd done it for about six months I really started to like so.  So, I've been doing it ever since.
R:  Great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, you must be in good shape then.
L:  Well, I'm working on it.  I just had my first baby about four months ago.  So --
R:  Oh, great.
L:  -- that kinda took a little bit out of me.  [LAUGH]  Took a lot outta me.
R:  So, you have one of those baby joggers so you can take the baby too?
L:  We did invest in one of those and we cut out a coupon for it too.
R:  [LAUGH] Okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  So, I really like that.  I also like to write a lot.
R:  Oh, that's fun.
L:  So, that's kinda my hobby.  I keep a journal and keep kind of snapshot paragraphs of my day.
R:  Okay.
L:  I really like to do that.
R:  I like to read.  I'm -- I'm not so much of a writer.  But, yeah, other than that I like to read.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, I listen to, you know, talk -- talk radio --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- talk shows during the day.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Not much of a T.V. watcher.
L:  Yeah, me neither.
R:  I think I'm pro- -- I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that hasn't been like -- I have never ever watched Survivor or American Idol.
L:  Oh, I'm with ya.  I think [LAUGH] ...
R:  I've never seen either one of those shows.
L:  Me neither.
R:  But I know the names.  I know what's going on just because everybody --
L:  Talks about it.
R:  -- around me is, you know -- but honestly I couldn't care a less.
L:  Yeah.  I know.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, you know, everybody -- really?  And I'm like, "No, I've never seen those shows" and it's, you know ...?
L:  Yeah.  It's kind of interesting that everybody's so interested in reality T.V. shows right now.
R:  Yeah, and -- and not just those.  I've never seen any of the reality shows.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It just isn't my bag.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Understandably.  I think I've seen clips of them, but not much more than that.
R:  Well, yeah, or I may have walked in the room.  But, I mean, I've not really sat down and ...
L:  And really followed it.
R:  Yeah.  I wouldn't -- T.V. is not probably one of my hobbies.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I don't w- watch much of it either.  My, um [LIPSMACK] -- my husband and I, um, didn't get a T.V. when we got married and we've kinda been living without one and actually it's a good life I think.  [LAUGH]  We have a lot more time to do things that need to get done and ...  So ...
R:  And you're probably spending more time with your baby and everything.
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  You know?
L:  A lot more.
R:  Although it was a diversion when I -- when they were really little, you know, like --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- when you're feeding 'em or when they're up at two or three in the morning.  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I hear that from young Moms that they kinda feel like that is their only thing they can do.  I do find I get in a lot of reading time though when she's eating.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, that's really good.  I'm, um, reading this book called From Beirut to Jerusalem on the Middle East and it's fascinating.  One of the best books I've ever read I think.
R:  Is it like a biography?
L:  Um, it's -- it's like just in -- its written by a journalist who lived in Beirut and Jerusalem --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and it's a history kind of except it's -- it's a modern history and just really interesting the perceptive he takes -- takes on things.
R:  Okay.  I may, um, try and get it from the library.
L:  Yeah, you should.  What -- what kind of books do you like?
R:  Um, kinda -- I don't read as many books as I used to, uh, more magazines 'cause that's all I have time for.  But, um --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- have you ever heard of the Left Behind series?
L:  I have.
R:  Yeah.  I've read those and oh, I like ...
L:  Yeah.  I heard they were really good.
R:  They are and I like biographies and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- things like -- mysteries.
L:  Uh-huh.  [PAUSE]  Oh, I've read some really good ones lately.  How much time do you spend reading?
R:  Oh, well, a little bit more lately.  My -- I have a, um -- my daughter's gonna be six tomorrow --
L:  Uh-huh.  [NOISE]
R:  -- and then I have, um, a seven year old son and a seven year old foster son.  So, I have two seven year olds and then my oldest is eight.
L:  Huh.  So, you don't have a whole lotta time to read?  [LAUGH]
R:  No.  So, she's in kindergarten.  So, I have her here in the morning and then in the afternoons I could read except I'm busy trying to do the gr- -- you know, then I try to do the grocery shopping and get everything done when, you know [LAUGH], nobody's here.
L:  Oh.  Oh, well, hey, I remembered one book that you have to read.
R:  Okay.
L:  One of the best I've ever read.  It's called E. Equals M.C. Squared, the his- -- or the Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation.
R:  Okay.
L:  Like, it's -- it's something that sounds completely boring, but it's just wonderful all the way through, really entertaining.
R:  Okay.
L:  It goes through the biographies of -- of all the great contributors to the E. equals M.C. squared, um, formula.
R:  Okay.
L:  Really, really good.
R:  The Biography of the World's ...
L:  Most Famous Equation.
R:  Okay.
L:  Good stuff.  Yeah, I really liked that.
R:  Yeah, reading's -- I mean, reading is great, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  A great hobby because it's portable, you can do it just --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- about anywhere.
L:  Have you tried books on tape?
R:  I've never done that.
L:  I like those a lot because then I do 'em while I'm doing other things and still get in reading time.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's really nice.
R:  Yeah.  I've heard -- I have a couple of friends that really like to do that, but I haven't tried that.
L:  Yeah.  Especially if you have a lot of quiet time or time that you're hands are busy and maybe you just have thinking time or something like that.
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  It's really good for that.
R:  Where -- where, um -- what part of Utah are you?  Are you right near, um, Salt Lake City?
L:  Yeah, I'm about, um, forty five minutes from Salt Lake.
R:  Okay.  Our, um -- actually the website, the one website, the lady that runs it is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- from Bountiful, Utah.
L:  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.
R:  Yep.  That's right in ...  So, she -- you know, they -- they went to the Olympics and all that and she --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sent pictures and everything --
L:  Huh.  That's cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- you know?  Is that far from you?
L:  It's about an hour from here.  I have a lotta good friends from Bountiful.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, yeah, that's cool.
R:  I've never been to Utah, but it looks -- it looks like a beautiful state.
L:  Yeah, it's got it's good points.  There's a lot of -- there's a lot of things -- especially in southern Utah they have a lot of biking and they have a marathon in St George in southern Utah and well, I guess there's the marathon in Salt Like too, um, and there's mountains and skiing and lots of outdoor stuff to do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And Salt Lake itself is a really beautiful city.
