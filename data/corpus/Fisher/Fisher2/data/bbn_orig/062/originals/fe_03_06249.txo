R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But ...
R:  You have the best of both worlds that way.  [LAUGH]

R:  Yeah.  Did you have a bad winter too?
L:  No.
R:  No?
L:  Our winter here was [MN] --
R:  Oh, we ...
L:  -- I don't even think we really got -- we didn't even get one major storm.
R:  Oh.

R:  We got hit with one right after the other.
L:  Oh.
R:  The last one was in April, the end of April.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, really?

R:  [LAUGH]
L:  There's a hobby!  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  God!
R:  I'm a grandmother so I remember those days.
L:  I'm tell ya, they don't make any noise until you get on the phone and boy, then watch out.
R:  Mhm.  Well, they figure you're occupied --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so you can't do anything about it, you know?
L:  Jeeze.
R:  You can't run and swat them one.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  [MN]
R:  [MN] Yeah.  So, as they say, great having grandchildren --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because as soon as they annoy you, you can just send them home.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Sometimes I'd like to send them away.  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] I mean ...
L:  You'd think she'd know.  You think they'll be old [NOISE] enough to know, you know, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my son he's sixteen.  So, he's got a job at Hardee's here in town and [SIGH] that's pretty much his hobby.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  He's working all the time it seems like.
R:  [MN]
L:  But ...
R:  Is he -- probably saving to buy a car?
L:  Well, he's got one, but it's not a real --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- nice one or anything.  So ...
R:  It's just a starter car?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Gets him where he needs to go, I mean.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  But ...

R:  -- I have two grandsons.
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, uh, man, oh, man.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE]
R:  That is just a great big difference between girls and boys.  I didn't realize it.  [MN]  But they're two -- they're very smart --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and very nice, but they're very, very noise.  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] They're usually ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  With them I'm, uh -- all my husband's brothers and sisters have got, um, kids.  I think our two are probably the most --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, with the b- -- with the best manners usually.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I don't know the rest of 'em just kinda get into everything.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  I said to my daughter -- her children don't walk into my house, they explode into it, like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- the door opens and they come in trying to get in ahead of the other one [LAUGH] and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- pushing each other.
L:  [LAUGH] As I said, that could pretty much be a hobby --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- is kids, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.  So, computer --
L:  That's like a ...
R:  -- computers might be a hobby.  I don't know how I lived before I got on.
L:  [MN] I know it.  [LAUGH]
R:  It's amazing.
L:  As I said, that and cooking is pretty much about the only hobbies I have, you know, too much any more.
R:  Yeah.
L:  My sewing is -- I don't know -- I don't really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get into that, you know, a whole lot anymore and my horseback riding -- they get -- we sold our horses just probably about, I don't know, a month or so ago 'cause we just didn't have the time anymore to put any work in with both of us working fulltime and --
R:  Oh, my!
L:  -- and my husband he works in construction so he's been working outta town.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they just weren't getting -- they weren't getting rode enough --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for what we have to pay for hay and we don't have to feed 'em 'cause, you know, we don't have our own hay ground or anything.  So ...
R:  Yeah.  [MN]
L:  But, yeah, my -- my, uh, surveys on the Internet is pretty much my main [LAUGH] --
R:  Me too.
L:  -- my main hobby.
R:  Me too.  I ...
L:  Making a few extra bucks.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Well, you see, I'm disabled and retired of course.  I'm seventy.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I mean, until I got a computer I just mopped around the house, watched television --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and -- and then I got a computer and the whole wide world is mine.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Oh, I know it.
R:  It's amazing.  I do my surveys and I chat with people on the different boards and they tell you where to go to sign up for this survey and that survey, and I keep track of my surveys and when the checks come in and --
L:  Yeah.  I do too.
R:  -- and I ...
L:  I have 'em wrote down and when I took 'em.
R:  Yeah.  And all -- and all the free stuff I get --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- it's incredible.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Absolutely incredible.
L:  Oh.
R:  They will send you anything.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I can't believe it.  My daughter's fascinated.  Every time she comes in she says, "Okay, what did you get now?"
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  Oh, I know it.
R:  Like, it made me feel like I wasn't isolated because -- because of my disability I can't drive anymore.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  So, I mean, I was literally turning into a vegetable.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But this keeps me -- my mind going a mile a minute.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And it's fun.
L:  That's pretty much what my, uh, my mother in law -- she, uh -- she's not quite sixty yet, but [LIPSMACK] she has that, um -- I don't know if you've ever heard of it -- fibro- fibromylagia or something like that --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and she can't stand on her legs for too -- you know, too long --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and she's always feeling sick she says.  So ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And she -- she moved to a little town, it's only about ten miles from us but, you know, even with that, I mean, we don't go over there, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- as much -- or we don't see her as much as we would've, you know, before --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when she was here in -- in Hampton with us.  But, um -- and she never leaves the house.  She's never drove in her life.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, boy!
L:  So [LAUGH], you know --
R:  That's tough.
L:  -- that's kind of a hermit life, you know?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, I mean, all the kids pitched in at Christmas time and bought her a brand new computer.  So, now she's on the Internet and ...
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  So ...
R:  I tell everyone, all my -- my friends that -- that I meet and they -- they say you don't have -- I don't -- you don't have a computer.  I said you have to get one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  You have no idea.
L:  Yep.  My Mom just finally got one too --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and she's -- it's just about driving her crazy 'cause she can't -- you know, she's not real familiar with how to run it, you know, and --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I told her, you know, when I got mine I didn't know what I was doing either, you know?
R:  Right.  I didn't either.
L:  I still -- I still don't know, you know, a whole lot about using the computer part of it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  It's mainly just the Internet that's a tool.
R:  Right.  That's all I do.  That's all I need it for is my Internet.
L:  So ...  Yep.  And like so, you know, before we got ours, like I always said, "Oh, yeah.  I'd love to have a computer, but I don't know what I would do with it".  Now that I got it, my God!
R:  You couldn't live without it.
L:  Well, it was -- yeah, it was broke down.  We've only had it for three years.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, about [SIGH] -- let me see -- was it December?  Somewhere between November and January my hardware fried.
R:  Oh, boy!
L:  Well, thank God, it was under warranty still.
R:  Oh, terrific.
L:  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, but still I had to wait for a week before we got the new part and got it in.
R:  I was going say what --
L:  I thought I was gonna go crazy.
R:  -- did you do while it was down?  [LAUGH]
L:  I just about went crazy.  [LAUGH]  I went -- I even went to the public library --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- to check, you know, 'cause like you say, you know, doing all those surveys --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you never know when you're gonna miss out on something.
R:  Right.  I mean --
L:  So ...
R:  -- I check into the one board that I watch where the people list the surveys and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- say this one is up and this one.
L:  Which one ...?
R:  I check in a couple of times a day.
L:  What do you -- which one do you look at?  The board --
R:  What do you mean, which one do I ...?
L:  -- you check in?
R:  Uh, big, big savings.
L:  Big, big savings?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Never heard of that one.
R:  Oh, it's great.  They have the reward board where they tell you all about the surveys.
L:  Oh.
R:  Then they have the freebie board and they give you all the links to all the freebies and everything else, and then they have the big deals board where they tell you, uh, where the big deals are, where you can get so much off here or this is one is giving this free, or [inaudible] is having this kinda sale or --
L:  Oh, wow!
