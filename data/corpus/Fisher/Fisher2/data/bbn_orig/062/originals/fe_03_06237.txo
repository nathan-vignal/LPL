L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name's Jean.
L:  Hi, I'm Corey.
R:  Hi, Corey.  Where do you live?
L:  Um, New York.
R:  Oh, I live in Ohio.
L:  Oh, wow.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, this is my first call and --
L:  Me [LAUGH] too.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, my heavens.  Well, I guess the topic is supposed to be hobbies.  What do you do?
L:  Well, um, hobbies.  My husband's always on my case 'cause he said he my hobbies are -- are to, uh, interest- -- are -- are too like housebound.  'Cause I -- I like to knit.  I crochet.  And I read, and ...
R:  Oh, I like to do those types of things too.
L:  Yeah, [LAUGH] see.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He's more like, "Let's travel.  Let's do this".  And I -- I, you know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's fun too.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you spend a lot of time with your hobbies?  [MN]  Like the knitting and crocheting?
L:  Um, yes and no.  I mean, I -- I -- it's hard for me to get time at home because I work out of the house, and then I have kids at home, so it's not easy to get time to do it.  But I work, you know, I knit and crochet a lot when I'm in the car or sometimes I can do it on the subway and ...
R:  Oh.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- I was doing a couple of road trips we had over the winter.  I was doing some crocheting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm still working on an afghan and started a -- a ripple.  A red, green and white one.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I -- I'm gonna make two of them actually.  Well, I should make three.  One for each one of my daughter and my daughter in law for Christmas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I'm going on like three years now.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Two years ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Sounds a lot like me.  
R:  Well, you can't really do it during --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the summer because it's too warm.  You don't want to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Right.  And [MN] when I've done blankets that's something I -- I can do them in the car.  I can't bring those on the subway 'cause they're too big.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, um --
R:  Yeah.
L:  When my son was born I took -- I -- I didn't finish his that I was making for him until he was one and a half and, uh, my daughter's a couple of months and I'm not anywhere near done with hers.  So ...
R:  Oh, my goodness.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Just little ones.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Well, my children are older and they both have children of their own.  I've got a three year old granddaughter and a three month old grandson.
L:  Wow.
R:  So that -- that's kind of a hobby for me.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I do a lot with, like, refunds and coupons and -- and stuff like that.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  That keeps me busy too, and I play on the computer a lot.
L:  Yeah, I've been doing that a lot [LAUGH] too.
R:  Probably too much.  It just seems like all of a sudden there's been a lot of things of interest on there.  You know, games and, you know, contests and things like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That kind of keeps me busy.
L:  Freebies.  I sign up for a lot of them[?].  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How did you find out about this site?
L:  Um, actually I was reading the Village Voice, which I hardly ever read.  So it's --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's kind of weird.  It's, um, you know, it's a Manhattan based newspaper but it's -- it's very trendy and very political and I hardly ever pick it up anymore.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And, um, I just -- I was walking to the train one day and -- and it's free, you know, it's in those --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- these cases on the street and I said, "I have nothing to read.  All right, I'll grab one of those".
R:  Oh.
L:  And I saw the ad.
R:  Wasn't that neat how what -- one thing leads to another.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  How did -- is -- how did you find out?  Was it in a paper or ...?
R:  Well, part of my hobbies -- well, like I said with the refunding and, uh, so forth, I visit the site, Refunding Makes Cents, and we -- that's -- you get -- I get a lot of information and everybody posts --
L:  One second.
R:  -- you know, good deals and stuff like that that are going on.  And this was amongst them.  And I thought, "Well, what the heck.  I'll sign up".  But I missed the first phone call on Sunday.  I wasn't home.  So I thought, "Well, you know what, I'll try this and give it a shot and make a couple of extra bucks anyway".  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  I've been doing these, um, this mystery shopping thing for --
R:  Have you?
L:  -- about a year now too, which is kind of fun.  'Cause it's --
R:  I have not tried any of that.
L:  It's good.  I mean there's -- I -- I'm signed up with a couple of companies and really [MN] I'm probably signed up with about five companies, but I really only get things from about two of them on a regular basis.  
R:  Oh.
L:  But it's nice 'cause if I can get restaurants I go --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- with my family.  And that -- that's another thing we do probably too much of.  Is eating out.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Do you live in -- in New York or like in the -- in the 'burbs?
L:  I live in Queens which is ou- outside --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- of Manhattan.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So I work in Manhattan so I'm commuting every day.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  But, you know.
R:  I live out in --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- the country so things are not that close so --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it's a little bit harder to participate.  It's about half an hour anywhere.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  From where I a- [MN] where I am.  And that's just to get to, like, a -- a local grocery store.  Uh, although we do have a little one right down the street, but I'm talking like a Giant Eagle or, you know, a -- a -- a chain.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And Walmart, or anything like that, so it's kind a hard for me to participate with activities like that although I would like to.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Unless I can get, like, lined up where I was just -- had a whole day and I was going from one to the next, but I know that would be really hard to do.
L:  Some people do it.  I -- I guess some people do it, you know, for a living.
R:  Must be on --
L:  I guess it's hard to --
R:  -- location.
L:  -- make a living ...
R:  Location, location.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, well, I got one company that -- that does these Starbucks, and in Manhattan the Starbucks are, like, every two blocks.  So ... [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, really?
L:  So, if I time it right I can do, like, three or four in one day.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Just by doing it before work and on my [LAUGH] lunch hour.
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, wow.
L:  So that's kind of --
R:  Oh, wow, that's great.
L:  -- become a hobby too over the last year, so ...
R:  Oh, we don't even a Starbucks close by.  Perhaps Youngstown would be the closest one or --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, towards Cleveland and stuff.  But that would be it.
L:  Well, Starbucks is one of those places that if they're paying me to go there I will but I -- I can't afford to pay four dollars for a cup of coffee in general.
R:  Oh, that's ridiculous.  
L:  So ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, God.  Yeah, here we are trying to save money.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Ex- --
R:  [LAUGH]  [inaudible] want to do that though.  That's just -- that's too much.  I don't, um, I'm a single mom --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I'm single now.  [LAUGH]  Uh, divorced.  So I'm -- I'm pretty much taking care of business all by myself.  I work a --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- full time job too.  So you have to make your dollar stretch where you can.
L:  Of course.
R:  Like you said, you know, if you go shopping anyway you might as well do a secret -- a secret, uh, shopping thing at -- at the same time and get it done with.
L:  Yeah, it's kind of fun.  I try to take the ones that are more fun, you know.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That -- that at least you get a little something out of, like -- like a restaurant or a coffee.
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, they have them for everything.  But ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  Do you think like you have a different attitude when you go in?
L:  Well, I don't know.  I -- I see everything different now.  Like now if -- if we'll go to a restaurant, y- you know, on our own, and -- and the service is slow, well [MN] I'll make a comment to my husband, like, you know, "Well, it's a good thing we're not, uh, mystery shopping today because they would do very poorly".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So there's a lot probably in your area?
L:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  
R:  Huh.
L:  I guess, uh, just because there's so many businesses here. 
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I try -- [MN] there- there's not to many, like, I don't take too many where I live just because I don't have the free time after work but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'll take them if they're near where I work because I can do it on my lunch hour or right after work.
R:  Uh-huh.  [LIPSMACK]  Oh.
L:  And in Manhattan --
R:  It still sounds like --
L:  -- there's everything.
R:  -- fun though.  
L:  It is.  It's kind a cool.
R:  Uh-huh.  What are you making now with your -- or are you knitting or crocheting?
L:  Um, I'm sort of working on the blanket for my daughter and then I'm also making a baby sweater for another person's baby, but the problem is it's going so slowly that I think she's gonna outgrow it before--
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- it's finished.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  And it's almost done.  It's just it was granny squares so now I have to, like, tuck in all the ends and I can't stand it.  I'm never making --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- anything with granny squares again.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I tried doing granny squares one time and I have got like a whole pile of 'em.  
L:  [MN]
R:  It seems like everytime I start to do 'em again -- if I don't do it all, like, at one time I'm inconsistent with my stitching.
L:  Oh. 
R:  I can't remember how I did it.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  And I +said, "Well, then maybe this isn't the thing for me to do".  
L:  Yeah.  My stitching always comes out too small.  Like sm- -- much, much smaller than the gauge.
R:  Oh.
L:  I have to go up three or four sizes and I don't know why that is.
R:  Huh.  Do you have little fingers or something?
L:  I jha- -- I do have little fingers but --
R:  Huh.
L: -- [MN] maybe that's it.  I don't know.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I -- do you write small too?
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  See I write big so everything I do seems to turn out big.
L:  That's funny.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Who would ever have thought there might be a pattern there?  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I have, uh, my boss makes these hats and I have to get the pattern from her, but they look like little fruits, like, they're baby hats but --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- they look a strawberry or a --
R:  Oh, how cute.
L:  -- watermelon.  You know, they have like a stem on the top.  And I want to get a pattern from her because a woman in my building is having a baby soon and I wanted to make one for her.
R:  Oh, that would be cute.
L:  Yeah.  Ha- hats are ea- -- you know, hats I can do.
R:  Mhm.
L:  One, two, three.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's [MN] sweaters that have to look, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even and -- and sewing things together and everything that is hard on me.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause I never really learned to sew.  You know, I can knit, I can crochet, but I never learned, like, stitching and --
R:  Huh.
L:  And I'd love to learn how to quilt.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That would be fun. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have seen some beautiful, beautiful quilts.
L:  Yeah.
R:  All handmade.  I guess that -- I live more of in a rural area so there's a lot of people who are really good in certain areas.
L:  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  Quite the expertise.  You know, it is passed down from generation to generation.  Some of the things that they make.  And a lot of woodworking and stuff like that too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  We're like, uh, Americana type stuff.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  See, I like things like that.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I -- I don't know how to do much of 'em.  Um, but it's funny 'cause I'm like the handy person in the house here.  My husband doesn't do any of that, but I'm the one who always has to fix things and put things together and -- and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- hang shelves.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, that's okay.  [MN]
L:  It's kind a cool.
R:  Oh, yeah, especially if you have somebody to tell you if it's even.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I had to put up -- see we live in a -- a small apartment.  A t- -- you know, a two bedroom apartment, so ...
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, my.
L:  When the baby came along there wasn't much room and especially closet space so I -- I -- the closet where -- in the other room really -- we really weren't hanging anything 'cause it's a pain in the neck to hang the kids clothes, so I bought those shelve and I had a drill and put in all these shelves, and it was the first major project I did.  And --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- people are like, "Well, why don't you have your husband help you?"  It's like, "He's no help".
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "He doesn't know the first thing about shelves and ..."
R:  I should have you --
L:  I really didn't know either but at least, you know, I [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I gave it a shot and it ...
R:  I should have you come down here and help me with my yard.  How [MN] -- how are you with landscaping?
L:  [MN]  Uh, no, landscaping I'm no good at because I -- I've don't have a garden.  I've never like, uh, dealt with that.
R:  [MN]
L:  I'm [inaudible] -- uh, my plants always die.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, the brown thumb.  That's what I have too.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I do like working out in the yard though.  Well, right now it's raining and our -- looking outward is what made me think of it.  I just moved around about two tons of dirt.  
L:  [MN]
R:  To make like a little bit of a raised beds.  I don't want 'em too high.  Just a little bit higher --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- than the ground level.  And I put them all [MN] -- I just finished this up because it's a ongoing project.  With wor- with working all day, and I go to visit my boyfriend in the weekend, and -- so I don't have too much time in the evenings to do it but I've been moving it all myself.  And I just finished the back [MN] along the driveway last night.  So I'm hoping it doesn't all wash away.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  With the rain we're supposed to be get-
