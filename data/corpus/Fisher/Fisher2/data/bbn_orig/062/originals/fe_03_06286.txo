R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  My name is Sarah.  I'm from Kansas.
L:  Hi, Sarah.  My name is Jenna.  I'm in Los Angeles.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  California.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Cool.
L:  How are you?
R:  I'm good.  So, what time is it there?
L:  Um, it is a little after seven, no, almost seven thirty.
R:  Oh, it's like nine twenty three here.  So ...
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah, different times.  So, um [LIPSMACK] -- so, do you have a hobby?
L:  Um, I have tons of hobbies actually.  This is the first topic I've got that I can actually talk about.  [LAUGH]
R:  Isn't that great?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.  I was like so relieved.  [LAUGH]
L:  Me too.  Um, you wanna go first or you want ...?
R:  Um, okay.  Well, right now I've actually just got out of -- I just graduated college and I'm working -- and I'm working on my master's degree.
L:  Congratulations.
R:  Thank you.  So, I'm kinda busy, but my latest hobby is couponing and like getting rebates and stuff.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, that's like -- and my husband just laughs at me.  I'm like, "Whoa, guess how much I paid for this?" and he's like ...
L:  I know.  I'm the same way.  Saving money is great.
R:  Oh, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, what are some of your hobbies?
L:  Gosh, well, um, I -- I'm also a postgraduate.  I work at U.S.C. and I'm gonna start my master's program soon.  I haven't yet though.  I'm just taking a little bit of a break from education.
R:  [MN]
L:  Um, so ...
R:  I don't blame ya.  [LAUGH]
L:  But [LAUGH] -- but the things that I enjoy, um, I -- I really like performing.  So, um, I'm in a Rocky Horror cast.  Are you familiar with -- with that at all?
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They -- they still -- they still do it.  I can't believe it's been like twenty five years, but they show the movie and we act it out in front of it and everybody wears costumes and everybody sings and that's really fun.
R:  Cool.  They usually only do that at, um -- at Halloween time, but ...
L:  Yeah, um, there's a lotta shows that -- that happen around Halloween, but our show's, um, every Saturday at midnight.  So ...
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  Um, and I'm also -- I just actually found out -- I'm really happy 'cause I just, um, auditioned for a community theater.  I just got a role in South Pacific.  So, I'll do that.
R:  [MN] I was actually in that play when I was in high school.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Like I did a community play, but I was still in high school.
L:  What were you?
R:  I was a nurse --
L:  That's what I am.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and an island girl.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  I loved it.  You'll have a great time.
L:  Oh, good.  Um, so, yeah, I'm -- I'm really into performing.  I'm in a choir, um, I sing also, I really enjoy that and, um, I like, uh, physical stuff.  I play hockey on Sundays, um, like street hockey.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, God, I'm really thinking else -- what else I do that qualifies as a hobby.  But, yeah, um, I think it also asked us like, uh, whether everyone needs at least one hobby.  I don't know.  I mean, I think everybody -- I -- I don't know, you know, what the -- what the exact definition of a hobby is.  But, yeah, I think everybody should do things that, you know ...?
R:  They enjoy.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  Exact- -- I understand that.  I know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have, um, tried to stay active and do some sports and stuff and I'm on a softball team right now, but ...
L:  You're in a softball team?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's really cool.  What position do you play?
R:  Um, well, actually I'm used to doing like third base, but just -- I've just joined this team and they needed a catcher.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- I was the catcher and I have like three big bruises on my knee to show it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Ouch.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, yeah, that's fun and ...
L:  Does your husband do that with you or ...?
R:  Do what?
L:  Does your husband play softball with you or ...?
R:  Well, he wants to, but they haven't -- we haven't found a co rep team that we can both play on.
L:  Oh.  So -- so it's all an [inaudible] league?
R:  Yes, so far.
L:  Well, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.   And, um, my husband's hobby is fixing up trucks and he just loves to talk about it and stuff.  So, I'm -- it's my hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But I guess I'm like learning more about it.
L:  Yeah, I understand.
R:  But -- well, your hobbies sound really interesting and they keep you busy with all those practices and ...?
L:  Definitely.  That's the only thing that -- the only downside I guess I seem to have no time to call my own because I'm always running from one thing to another.  Um, our Rocky Horror cast is actually doing another -- we're shadowing another review.  We're doing Grease Two.
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  I don't know if you've ever seen it, but it's the [LAUGH] worst movie ever.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, and we have to -- basically we do exactly -- you know, in front of the screen exactly what's on screen.  So, it's been really goofy and fun.  But [LAUGH] it's just such a terrible movie.
R:  Oh, I know.  I've seen it.  It's [LAUGH] -- yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm sorry.
R:  It is.  Um, so, do you -- this is just your free time that you're in the Rocky picture thing, you don't get paid or it's not through school or anything?
L:  No, it's just for fun.  But it -- but it is really fun.  It's a really free atmosphere and it's -- it's a very like open environment and that can be really fun.  You can be creative and -- and expressive and that's neat.
R:  So, what did you major in in college?  Was this -- were you in like drama or theater or ...?
L:  You know what's funny?  I -- international relations.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  I -- I don't feel like I'm especially talented or -- or would wanna pursue, you know, acting or singing or anything as a career.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It's just something I really enjoy doing.  So, I don't mind that I don't get paid for it.  It's just something I do in my -- in my spare time.
R:  Wow!  I am so jealous.  I kinda live in like an isolated area that they don't really have a community theater right now --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and I would love to get back into it.
L:  Did you do stuff in college?
R:  Um, when I was like -- I went to a junior college at first and it was small enough that I had enough time and could do that sort of stuff and, um, I got my degree in early childhood education.  So, I'm a preschool teacher.
L:  Oh, wow!  That's great.
R:  So, I -- right now I don't have much time but, um ...
L:  Are you, um -- you're pursuing your master's in the same field, education?
R:  Yeah, early childhood specialized this time.  Just a ...
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  'Cause I always ...
L:  That's actually really rewarding.  I, um -- when I was in college I was in a numerical project where we taught, um, under privileged preschoolers and worked with some kids with some, um, dis- disabilities.  They were all, um, three to five year olds --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, I mean, there's so -- I mean, I'm sure you know but, I mean, there's so -- you can -- you can do so much to help them with their development at that stage and it must be really rewarding for you.
R:  Oh, yes, it's great.  I work with at risk children.  So, you know, I guess you can consider that a hobby, coming up with activities and everything to help 'em all and ...
L:  Oh, you're so cool.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I think you're cool.  I'm like wow!
L:  That's awesome.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, have you done one of these -- these telephone studies before?
R:  Just one other time.  Have you?
L:  Yeah, I've done two and one of them was how much sports -- I mean, how -- you know, how much sports do you watch on television and, of course, I don't watch anything except a little bit of hockey.  So, it was like ten minutes of silence [LAUGH] and then the -- the most recent one was affirmative action.  So, I definitely had nothing to say about that.
R:  Oh, no.  I've been pretty lucky because the other one I did was like what if you got paid a million dollars, but the only thing you couldn't talk about is, um, uh -- you could never talk to your best friend again.  So, I'm like okay, that wasn't too bad, but ...
L:  Like you had to choose one or the other, or ...?
R:  Um, we -- you just had to choose if you'd take the million or you would not talk to your best friend.
L:  Well, that's kinda interesting.
R:  Yeah.  So, it was good.
L:  Mm.
R:  But it was -- and I'm like ten bucks.  Heck, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, you know what I found out?  I guess they don't pay you until you've done all three of 'em.  This is my last one but, um -- but you have to do the other -- you know, you have to do one more I guess in order to get paid.
R:  Oh, could you do more, like ...?
L:  I think he said three was the limit.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I didn't know it was also, you know, they don't pay you until you do all three either, but --
R:  Oh, I didn't know that either.
L:  -- it's okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  How did you hear about it?
L:  Um, we have, uh, this thing called Craig's List --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I found it out on that.  It's basically a -- like an online community where people can post all kinds of things like extra jobs or, you know, kittens for sale, really it's just all encompassing.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  Well, I'm a -- my hobby [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- I'm on this like refunding website and it said, "Hey, everybody.  Here's a good thing you can do".  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, great.
R:  So, that's how I found out about it.  I'm trying to convince my husband to do it so I can get a dollar.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, that's true, the referral thing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, the first person I ever talked to -- I -- I guess the study's done by the University of Pennsylvania --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so, um, the first guy I ever talked to was actually a student there.  So, it's like a lotta the people on it I guess are students of the faculty of the university.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I didn't know that.
R:  Did you ever talk to a guy?
L:  Yeah, the first one was a guy and then, um, the other person I talked to -- she was also a girl.  She was a lot easier to talk to and I don't know why.
R:  That's -- I was gonna ask you.  Was it harder to talk to a guy?  [LAUGH]  'Cause I'm like [MN].
L:  I mean, also the topic being sports didn't help 'cause he -- he just -- I think he just thought I was an idiot.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I'm like, um, okay, I watched figure skating on the Olympics.
R:  Does that get -- I don't know -- like, oh, my gosh!  That's for [inaudible].
L:  Exactly.
R:  That's not a sport, guys wearing leotards!  [LAUGH]  
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh.
L:  So, how did you get -- I mean, this -- the couponing and the -- the rebates and stuff -- I mean, you seem to really actively pursue it -- how do you -- where do you find stuff?
R:  Well, um, I'll just kinda go -- like, some of the grocery stores like double your coupons, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I only get stuff that's on sale and like double my coupons.  So, it's almost like nearly free for each item --
L:  That's cool.
R:  -- and some of 'em like you can find out that, um -- like Miller Beer right now --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- as long as you -- you can get like seven dollars back in refund.  So, you don't even have to buy beer, like if you buy like potato chips or like pop or anything you just -- all you have to do is like save your receipt and send it in and they'll send you money.  So, I'm like whoa!  [LAUGH]
L:  Wow!  That's really cool.
R:  Free money.
L:  And so there's -- you said you found this on a -- on a rewards website?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LIPSMACK] It's called -- it's W.W.W. R.M.C. dot com if you want to make ...
L:  And it all just has the special offers and things?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Cool.  I'll check that out.
R:  Yeah, you should.
L:  You know, I'm saving money -- we -- the main, uh, grocery store in my area is Ralph's and they have this thing where, you know, it's like a club thing.  If you have little, you know, grocery store club you get a discount on -- on certain things --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and at the bottom of the receipt it always says, you know, you spent this much and you saved this much, and I get so excited about that.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Look at what you saved!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, exactly.
R:  I like buy a Sunday paper now just to get the coupons 'cause I'm like it's worth a dollar fifty to me because I'll save a dollar fifty I'm sure.
L:  That's -- especially -- I mean, I'm sure your education is not that, uh, inexpensive.
R:  Right.  Right.  I'm still paying for that, but I'm like whoa, I'm saving --
