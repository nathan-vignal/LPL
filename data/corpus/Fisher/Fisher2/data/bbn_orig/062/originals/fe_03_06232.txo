R:  Uh, hi.
L:  Hi, how are you?
R:  Fine, how are you.
L:  Just fine.  My name is Gerry.  And I'm --
R:  I'm Robyn.
L:  And I'm from Arizona.
R:  I'm from California.
L:  Oh, okay, so we're pretty close.
R:  Up -- up around Sacramento.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I've got a daughter that lives in San Jose.  
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh --
L:  So ...
R:  I -- I'm not -- I've only, uh, lived out here for about six years.  I -- I'm originally from Missouri and then I lived in Laughlin, Nevada, for three months and then up here.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  My goodness.  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Where in Missouri are you from?
R:  Uh, Springfield area.
L:  Oh, okay. 
R:  Where all those --
L:  I --
R:  Round the area where all those bad tornadoes were.
L:  Oh, you poor thing.
R:  [inaudible] 
L:  Do you have family that got hurt?
R:  Well, uh, they live in -- all live in Springfield and the areas were, uh, all round them.
L:  Oh.
R:  It -- it just -- they got out of it.  Just it's all around them.
L:  [MN]  Oh, my goodness.  Well --
R:  My kids were there so I was, you know, sitting here and wondering, you know, " [MN] Are they okay?  Are they okay?"  You know.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, I bet.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, I guess our topic of the day is hobbies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And do you have any?
R:  I guess, basically, m- mine mainly is -- I like to do these, um, point thingees on the internet.
L:  Oh.
R:  Earn points --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know.  The re- rewards program.
L:  Oh, you do!
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.  I've never heard of that.  It -- well, I take that back.  I -- I'm on the internet all the time.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I saw something that said -- and I thought it was kind of a scam so I just ignored it, you know.
R:  Yeah, well I do -- like my points, um, there are blink[?], uh, memolink and there's P.H.C. points and lucky points.
L:  Oh.
R:  And I've -- right now I'm waiting on -- on, like, thirty more dollars in gift certificates to restaurants to come and --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- I've got fifty at home right now that I need to use.  
L:  [MN]  You're kidding me.
R:  So, yeah, they're -- they're really -- I mean, uh, some of 'em take a long time to get and some of 'em are quick.  Like, the -- my points you get your -- your gift certificates within a couple of weeks usually.
L:  Uh-huh.  Now what do you get points for?
R:  Clicking on a websites.  
L:  Oh, you're kidding.
R:  Or if you, you know, if you -- if click in is all you do it takes a long time to get the points.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- if you buy stuff you --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you can get more points.  Uh, [MN] my husband bought a computer around Christmas time.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So through using my points he got a ton of points.  [LAUGH]  He got --
L:  Oh.  Wow.  
R:  So it was --
L:  [MN]
R:  It was -- it was nice.  Got some gift certificates.  Got a nice dinner out to eat on it because of it and ...
L:  Uh-huh.  All just for buying it over the computer, huh?
R:  Yeah.  He -- he got l- like, um, I think a thousand points for buying it plus five points for each dollar he spent, you know.  So that added up to quite a few points.
L:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's funny.  I'm gonna have to look further into that.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, just look up rewards programs.  You know do a search for rewards programs.
L:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'll be darned.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, I collect.  So I guess I should say that my hobby is collecting.  I have all kinds of collections.
R:  Oh, what kind -- like what -- what are some of the --
L:  Well, I --
R:  -- biggest one.
L:  Let's see.  I collect, uh, china head dolls.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I collect glass slippers.  You know those little -- just the little shoes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I collect those.  I collect them in glass and I collect them in porcelain.  
R:  Mm.
L:  You name it I collect it.  My husband --
R:  Just everything, [MN]?
L:  -- laughs.  Everything.  You name it and I want to collect it.
R:  Yeah.  I know --
L:  But, uh --
R:  I know my -- my son collects baseball cards.
L:  Oh, does he?  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Oh.  I wish that --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- I would not collect because I -- I just start getting too much.  You know.
R:  Yeah.  They -- they -- it does take up a lot of room.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  I guess. 
L:  Yeah.  And you just -- after a while you look at it and you think -- I know, uh -- I had for a while there I was buying lo- -- those, um, little angel dolls on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- the phone.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Or not on the phone but, um, through the magazines.  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And they -- and each one was like fifty dollars.
R:  That can add up then.
L:  Well, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And I think I bought like six of 'em.  And I'm thinking, "Gee".
R:  Well, if you're -- you can always go on ebay and -- and --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- sell some if you --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- ever need to.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- well, I did -- I tried to sell some jewellery on ebay and I just -- I -- it went cheap, you know.  And -- I think everybody's looking for a bargain on ebay.
R:  I -- yeah, I think so too.
L:  You know.
R:  My husband, anytime he has put something on ebay he's always put, uh, a starting price on it.  That way ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know [several inaudible words].
L:  Of what you want, right?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Yeah.  That -- that's kind of what I did and I [MN] -- it was right before Christmas and, of course, I did sell some jewellery right before Christmas and I made it, you know.  
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, and I did pretty well then, but it was still the cheaper, you know, ten, fifteen dollars, sometimes twenty.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  But, uh -- and I guess, maybe, if I had the right volume or something.  I didn't really have the right volume so ...
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh -- but I do love ebay.  Does your husband do it quite a bit or ...?
R:  [MN]  Not a lot.  Just --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, every now and then.  He's -- like once we went somewhere and he was looking at motorcycle stuff because we have a motorcycle and he found a -- a little, um, um, book [MN] -- book about it.  What do you call it?  The owner's manual.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was brand new.  He bought it for five bucks at the motorcycle shop and put it on ebay and sold it for twenty six.
L:  You're kidding.
R:  And my --
L:  That's amazing.
R:  My brother in law is really into it.  He, um -- that's one of his hobbies is ebay.  He, uh --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- goes to sales and flea markets and stuff and he bought this kid's game.  I don't remember what it was called.  He bought it for like three dollars and fifty cents.  And he sold it for a hundred and fifty six --
L:  [MN] 
R:  -- dollars on ebay.
L:  You're -- it must have been a collectible or something.
R:  It must've been.  It was, um, a Milton Bradley game.  It had something about, like, uh, this helicopter thing.  You put it in the middle of it.  Stuck it in the middle of it and wind -- would wind it up and this helicopter was even flying around on top of it.  I cannot remember the name of the game but I could not believe he made about a hundred and fifty dollars profit on that.
L:  Oh, my gosh.  That's [LAUGH] great.  
R:  Yeah, I wish I could find good deals like that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  You know, I -- I have a neighbor whose son -- whose, uh, brother over in California, he -- he sells on ebay and you know what he sells, those little, um, old pedal cars.  Do you remember back -- oh, I don't know, probably in the fifties?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Pedal cars were real popular for kids.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  And he redoes 'em and gets 'em all painted up and everything, and he makes thousands of dollars.
R:  Wow.  
L:  You know.  And I guess he sells on the internet too and does quite well.  But I think you have to, kind of, have a niche or something.
R:  Yeah, you do.  Like those little army men.  He -- he buys --
L:  Yeah.
R:  My -- my brother in law buys those and there's certain brands of 'em that average out to about a buck a piece.  You know, he'd sell, like, twenty five cents of army men and we get twenty five bucks for 'em, you know.  Just little teeny plastic army men.  
L:  Isn't that funny.
R:  It is.
L:  That's ama- -- it's amazing what people will buy.  
R:  It -- it is.  I -- I don't -- I don't have any good luck in finding stuff like that, you know.  I -- I go to -- I'll go to a garage sale now and then and -- and look, you know.  I don't find anything.
L:  No, I don't either.  Or -- I -- I don't have the eye for it.  I think you have to have an eye or --
R:  Yeah --
L:  -- something.
R:  -- that -- that's it.  
L:  You know.  
R:  Yeah, whenever --
L:  Yeah, I --
R:  -- I [several inaudible words] the army mail[?] look at the bottom of 'em to see if there's a PPs or the Lewis --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- marks or wherever they are.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  You know.  [MN] Everytime I go.
L:  [LAUGH]  Well, if you could just -- you know what I love.  I love glassware.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And that's another little hobby of mine collecting.  Is sort of collecting -- I lo- love to collect that pink depression glass.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  And, uh, you know, I'm always on the lookout for something.  But, of course, I hardly ever find it out here.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just too rare.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But, uh ...
R:  Yeah, my -- my husband's just got into a new hobby recently.  He's into radio controlled airplanes.  
L:  Oh my goodness.
R:  And he -- he, uh -- he's bought one a couple of weeks ago and he bought another one, uh, last week and he was flying his one last week, and there's a canal behind our house.  We live out in the country and there's a canal behind our house.  Quite a ways up really but the plane went down into the canal.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, no. 
R:  And he was back --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- there and he was hollering at me.  He goes, "Go get a rope" you know.  And I'm --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- got there and got a rope and he's -- wanted me -- he wanted me and his mom to hold the rope while --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- he climbed down.  I said, "No".  I said, "Just throw it down or try to rope it" you know.  And he finally -- he --he kept throwing the rope down there trying to get it roped and he finally got it out.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  It didn't work for a little while but once it dried -- got all dried out it seemed to be --
L:  It was okay?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Are they very expensive?  They are --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- aren't they?
R:  Yeah.  That one was like almost two hundred dollars and, um --
L:  Yeah, I was gonna say.  I thought I remembered somebody telling me that they were --
R:  Yeah.  I was thinking I wish he'd get a --
L:  -- at least over a hundred.
R:  Wish he'd get a cheaper hobby.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Especially if he keeps landing in the canal or something.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  He may lose it one of these days.
L:  That's right.  That's right.  But you know what, that isn't too bad of a hobby if you enjoy it, I guess.
R:  Yeah.  Well we --
L:  You know.
R:  -- went to the hobby shop out there and they had this one great big plane and it was, like, three thousand dollars.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  And I thought -- I told him -- I looked at 'em, I said, "You're not getting that one".  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  He looked at -- that -- [MN] it -- it can be pretty expensive.  They're having some thing out here in a couple of weeks that people are gonna be out there flying -- having plane flying races with their model airplanes and he wants to go out and watch.  
L:  Oh, my gosh.  That -- yeah, well, you know, that's kind of nice too.  Because at least he invites you to go with him.  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- had to do something this -- this Sunday and, um, I wasn't going to get home, you know, in time for him to go with him at the first, but he was -- was going to watch this thing and he went out there and then he called me later and says, "Well, are you home yet?" and I said, "Yeah, I just got home".  And he goes, "Oh, I'm gonna come and get you.  You got to come out here and watch this."  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah, I do volunteer work with the Sheriff's Department so I never know when they're gonna [LAUGH] want me to do something --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- on the weekend.
L:  Oh, geez.  Well, how fun.  So you live in the country.  Do you live -- you live -- you don't live in town then, huh?
R:  No.
L:  You live--
R:  It's a -- it's a [MN] -- it's a little town called Wilton.  It's kind of south -- kind of south, south east or so of Sacramento.
L:  Uh-huh.  Oh.  
R:  It's a little biddy tiny town [inaudible].  So ...
L:  Well, I'll be --
R:  It's nice not have neighbors two feet from you, you know.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I bet it is.  I bet it is.  
R:  It -- it -- [MN]
L:  Because I live right here in Mason.  It's in the middle of, you know, it's -- it's
