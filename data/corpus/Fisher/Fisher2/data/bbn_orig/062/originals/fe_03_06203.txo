R:  My name is Christie.
L:  Hi, Christie, my name is Donna, how are you today?
R:  Just fine, how are you?
L:  Okay.  And the topic of the day is hobbies, how much time we spend on 'em.  [LIPSMACK] Um, I -- and do you think everybody should have a hobby?  Yes, I think everyone should have a hobby, I think it's some kind of outlet.  I would have to say I spend about two and a half hours a week on a hobby.  Um, how about yourself?
R:  Um, I agree, I do believe that everybody should have a hobby, just for a fact of most hobbies are an aspect of people's lives that they can relearn to relax and relate to, and even if it's to the point of just getting out aggression! [LAUGH]
L:  That's the truth.
R:  That's true, yeah.
L:  You need sometime for R. and R. you know, just to get away from it all.
R:  Right.  What kind of, uh, hobbies do you do?
L:  Okay, well, I enjoy exercising.  I mean, I don't know if that's a hobby but I do look for that time for myself.
R:  Right.
L:  Um, I do enjoy walking.
R:  Oh, I do that -- I do that very well. [LAUGH]  I do --
L:  Yeah, I like that, I think that really --
R:  [COUGH]
L:  -- clears my head, relieves a lot of stress.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, I try and do about --
R:  And it's healthy for you.
L:  I'm sorry?
R:  And it's healthy for you.
L:  And it's healthy for you.  And then you feel good, you feel a little bit more energized from it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, it only takes like a few minutes a day.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I try and do it at least three times a week though.  If I could, you know, I try to.
R:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
L:  Not every week I succeed but ...
R:  Right.  I try to do mine, uh, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on my lunch breaks.
L:  Oh, me too. [LAUGH]
R:  And I --
L:  Mine's just usually like, right after dinner, like, Monday, Wednesday and Friday though, exactly.
R:  I wish I could do mine after dinner but it's -- my husband's like, "Well, it's eight o'clock".
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And I'm going, "So?  It's cool, it's nice and calm in the evenings".  And he's going, "But I gotta do this, that and the other thing".  So I found out, do it on my lunch break, even though I know it's in the day of -- dead of heat day, but, you know, you keep plenty of water, you keep, you know, that mentality going, and you just -- just go and go and go until you almost hurt and you can't do it no more! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right, [inaudible] though.  It does make you feel good after you're done though.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I -- I really do believe it boosters your metabolism, it gives you a little bit more energy.  But there's a lotta other hobbies I would like to do but I don't get the chance to do.
R:  Oh, what would you like to do?
L:  Well, I would love to go to AC Moore[?].  I saw so many nice things in there that I would love to do and make but, you know, time is o- -- is of the essence.  There's just not enough hours in a day for everything that you gotta do.  But like, they got these cute little doll houses, they got all these kinda like, um, [LIPSMACK] what would you call them?
R:  Do you -- do you wanna paint them or ...?
L:  Like sticker box paint them, uh, they have all these beautiful planners that you can make out of wood and hand paint them yourself with stencils and, you know, if I had more time I would love to do like, things like around the house, like Martha Stewart does! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I know, doesn't she just make you just go, "Oh --"
L:  Yeah.
R:  "-- that is so gorgeous".  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  If only we had the time.
R:  How quick can you do that again? [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I know, uh, I enjoy -- I work -- working with my hands, whether it's, um, clays or, um, markers or --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- just, um, crocheting with fabrics.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I just love making things with my hands.  And I don't know, they sh- -- I don't know what it is, I can just sit there and just crochet a blanket and it's just, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and sit there and watch TV and just keep going at it and it's just like, "Wow, this is getting big".
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Yeah.  And it's like it's keeping my mind busy even though when I'm watching TV is nothing, you know, [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, I hear ya.
R:  -- worth watching. [LAUGH]
L:  But no, hobbies are fun.  I think everybody should have them.  I think everybody needs -- I think w- we live in a fast paced society today that everybody's work -- workaholic too much.  I think everybody should like, spend a little time on themselves.
R:  Oh yeah.  I think if people had more, uh, time devoted to a little bit of R. and R. and their hobbies, and find something that they actually want to do and enjoy doing on a regular basis, that, you know, I don't think the stress level would be that high.
L:  Yeah.  See, that's the key there, doing something that you like to do most of the time but we do things 'cause we have to do them.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, it's like we have to go to work, we have to do this for our family, we gotta do this.
R:  [SIGH]
L:  But it's the truth.  I mean, I think everybody should be entitled to like, just kick back and say, "You know something?  This is something I wanna do".  I think everybody deserves that, no matter how busy you are, what your schedule is like.  You know?
R:  And people get so hard on themselves 'cause they feel like they're not accomplishing it and they don't have time to do their hobbies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  'Cause I know I love writing poetry, and books, and I've actually got, uh, one piece, um, published.  And it's like that is --
L:  Wow, that's great.
R:  Yeah, actually it was.  I was just flabbergasted that it -- you know, something that I did in my spare time just, you know, part of my hobbies and I was just doodling and it -- and it came out great and I ended up getting it published, um, I was like, that is something -- I don't know if I consider it a hobby, but it's just something that -- it's -- you know, I got a spare minute and all of a sudden something will come through my mind and I just start writing.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful, God bless you.
R:  And -- and, oh, I love it.  I -- I love having that --
L:  I would love to write children's books, that was always one of my dreams.
R:  I have actually, uh, wrote several of 'em.
L:  Oh wow.
R:  I haven't got 'em published or anything but I'm working -- that is one of my other hobbies! [LAUGH]
L:  Really?  Look at that.
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I have a bunch of them, I just don't do half of them! [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
R:  The only one I really do on a main- maintain basis is walking, and that's because I'm pregnant and I have to keep that mentality and that, um, [LIPSMACK] energy going, and, uh --
L:  Yeah, sure, because it [several inaudible words], and how far along are ya?
R:  Oh, I am twenty eight weeks.
L:  Oh that's wonderful.
R:  [LIPSMACK] And --
L:  You're like, seven months, you'll be delivering soon.
R:  Oh, I know.  Um --
L:  First child?
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, congratulations!
R:  Thank you.  And I know that's just something that, you know, even becoming pregnant and all the little things that just go through your mind, you know, just writing down stuff like that.  And so many different stories come to mind, you know, just by sitting there and thinking about what it's gonna be like.
L:  Mm.  Well I'm a mother of two -- of two grown children.
R:  Oh wow.
L:  Now, I tell ya, it's -- it's not an easy task! [LAUGH]
R:  [MN]
L:  It's a wonderful thing --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- it's a beautiful thing, I mean, oh, you'll sit there and you'll be amazed, you'll love them, you know, he or she, [MN] you know, watch 'em sleep.  You know, you're just like, you just get so amazed --
R:  Just amazed.
L:  -- of what y- -- what you have made and what yous two have a conquered, but i- i- it's a hard job.  It -- it -- you know, it really is.  I mean, I'm not gonna lie to ya.  But it's a fun job.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I mean, I [MN] -- I +stayed --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- home with my kids when they were little and guess what?  I loved every moment of it.  I l- -- in fact I wish they were little again --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- because I said it was -- it was the best time of my life.  You know what I mean?  Now it's like, huh, you go to work every day, you -- you still got the same chores but it isn't as fun as then.  Like them waking up in the morning and saying, "Oh, Mommy, you're the greatest" or --
R:  [MN]
L:  --"Mommy, I love you so much" or, "Mommy, here's a flower for you" or things like that.  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- it's really, really enjoyable.
R:  Now, did you -- were able to do more of your hobbies when your children were younger or now that they're, um, living -- getting older?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I would say a little bit more as I was getting older because I made sure that they were the center of my life instead of them being the center of my life.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know what I mean?  But we did a lotta hobbies togetheR:  all their school projects.  I mean, I was always there for them, you know, any time they needed projects, I mean, I helped in school, I helped out in Little League, my husband coached, I worked the stand, I mean, we were there like, day and night, day and night, night.  So I would have to say, I don't know, I probably got a lot more hobbies done why they were little, only for the -- for the sheer fact that they had a lotta hobbies.
R:  Right.
L:  So I used to like, just sit down and enjoy them with them and say, "Oh, well look, we can do it this way, we could it your way" you know, just give some ideas and stuff.  But it was very, very fun.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I'm -- I know that's something that I'm looking forward to doing, you know, with my time off.  Unfortunately I might have to go back to work afterwards but that time off to sit and just revel, um, in the concept of, one being a mother, and two just having the, uh, opportunity to do some of those hobbies that I have been neglecting so much because I feel so much kinda like a failure to the concept of I've got all this that I have to do at home and I have no time for my hobbies! [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, that's true.  But, you know, you know, you need balance like everything else in life.  And --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you'll do the most important to the least important.  You know what I'm trying to say?  So y- you'll -- you'll get around to it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But a lotta times like, you know, you don't mind sacrificing your own self or your own pleasure because you know that foremost and utmost they're more important.
R:  Oh right.
L:  You know what I'm trying to say?
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  So like -- like, to me, like, reading to your children, you know, a bedtime story was more important than me doing something for myself.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, just making sure that they were tucked in and they got in -- they went to bed happy and, you know, blah blah blah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And it was very, very fun.
R:  Yeah, I know, I have a seven year old step daughter.
L:  Okay.
R:  And, uh, she'll -- she all the time, "Tell me a story, tell me a story, tell me a story" which encourages my hobbies because that's how I come up with half the stories I tell her.
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  And so I tell her a story and then I get, you know, get my little pen and paper out, then I'll just sit down and write it afterwards, you know, after she goes to sleep, and you'll be -- I -- I'm just amazed a year later, you know, "Well, you tell me a story tonight".
L:  Yeah.
R:  And she'll come up with that exact same story --
L:  Ain't that amazing how they remember everything?
R:  And it's like ... "Sweetie, did I just read that to you last night?"  And, "No, I just made that up" and I'm going, "I know [inaudible] you did!" [LAUGH];
L:  [LAUGH] That is really cute that.
R:  'Cause I know what my niece, she had her fifth birthday I, um, made her a book and I gave her a pretty little cover for it and everything, about her and her little cousin going to the zoo together and all the different things that they saw and all the different things that they did and she still has it to this day.
L:  Wow, look at that, mm.
R:  And it's like, you know, that was just something that was just so minor, you know, to me, to do that for her, and now it's something that she collects.
L:  And yet she treasures that, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's true.  I did that for a cousin of mine, I was of -- her maid of
