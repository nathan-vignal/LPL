L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.  [MN] My name's Kerry.
L:  Mine's Anna.
R:  Hi.  
L:  Hi, there.
R:  Uh --
L:  So do you have any hobbies?
R:  Um, probably just shopping.  Um ...
L:  That ca- that can be hobbies for people.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  And, +I like to, um, do a little crafty stuff.  Like around the house.
L:  What kind of stuff?
R:  Um, I -- I painted some furniture.  Sta- -- restaining furniture, um, decorating, um, painting furniture for my daughter's room.  Things like that.
L:  I like doing that kind of stuff too.
R:  Do you?  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  I like to restore old furniture.  
R:  Oh.  I haven't been that brave yet.  I have some -- I have a -- a few old pieces that [NOISE] need to be restored but I haven't had a chance to.
L:  I mean, I'm not saying I restore it to what it used to look like when somebody made it in the very beginning.  I just restore it to a useful look.
R:  Yeah, well that -- yeah I could --
L:  And then I usually get money out of it because everybody says, "Oh, this looks so good" and I'm like [MN] "Well, I just did it so I could use it".  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, make it usable.
L:  My hobby is gardening.  I love to garden.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  I like the flower garden.
R:  Flowers.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Good.
L:  All kinds of flower gardens and landscaping.  I love to do that stuff.
R:  I wish I had the -- the -- the knack for it but I just -- [SIGH] I just -- I -- I don't --
L:  I just look into different, um, summer magazines, as far as outdoor stuff, to get ideas of how I want my flowers to look in the summer.  I'm not saying I have it all upstairs in my head.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm not that good at it.  But I just go with different ideas every year.  
R:  Hm.  Well I -- I -- I'll go to the garden center and I'll look at all the different th- -- all the different flowers and try to figure out which ones will go together.  I just can't get it all together in my [LAUGH] head.
L:  I can't --
R:  I guess I need to --
L: -- either that's why I look in the magazines.  And they give you, um, diagrams and blueprints.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  And they give you -- tell you exactly where to plant stuff.  I take that with me to the store.
R:  Oh, well, that's a good idea.  I hadn't tried -- I hadn't thought about that.  
L:  It works.  
R:  Huh.
L:  And then when you take it home you just mark it on the ground with stakes so you know where to plant the stuff.
R:  Hm.  Well, that's --
L:  Even if you use popsicle sticks.  Depending on --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- how much space you have.  
R:  Hm.  That is --
L:  Because I know -- if you're like me you forget where you're supposed to be planting it or where you did.
R:  Yes, exactly.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So the popsicle sticks come in handy.
R:  Oh, well, that's an int- -- do you ever grow any flowers just from seeds?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh.  
L:  Yep.
R:  I can't.  I've tried.  I've tried watermelons.  Didn't work.  I don't think I watered them -- them enough.  And I've tri- --
L:  What kind of ground do you have?
R:  Well, it was when we lived in Louisiana.  And I just used potter -- potting soil.  So I may -- I may not have used, uh, the right --
L:  Did you add any fertilizer with it?
R:  Probably not.
L:  That's probably why it didn't grow.  'Cause, like you said, the soil everywhere is different.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And so is the -- there's a lot of variables to it to get everything to grow.  
R:  Yes.  It's all -- it's a science.  [LAUGH]  
L:  I have a lot of sand around my house.
R:  Oh.
L:  So mixing it with dirt, it's really, um, it's drainable really easy because of the sand.  So everything grows here.  Whether I want it to or not.
R:  Oh, well that's --
L:  Including all the weeds.
R:  Oh, [LAUGH] yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  That's what our -- our yard is mostly weeds.  It's not grass [LAUGH] it's mostly weeds.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  You got crab grass?
R:  Uh --
L:  Or do you have real grass?
R:  Well, yeah, that -- it -- [MN] it's a pretty new house and they planted the Ber- Bermuda grass or they -- they +sowed it with Bermuda grass.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And this is our second year here and it just seems like ...
L:  So do you like moving?  
R:  [MN]
L:  And you know would redecorate the house?
R:  Yes, but we moved into a h- -- a -- a -- a brand new house and it was a total different style than what I had in my old house.  My old house was -- it was already decorated with the wallpaper and stuff, like country.  
L:  Oh, no.
R:  And when we moved here it was totally -- I mean, I --I just kind of went with it and decorated it country when we lived there but, um, now that we've moved here I just have beige walls.  [LAUGH]  Everywhere.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, see, you get to start all over again with just what you want in there.
R:  I know, but I just don't know -- I can decorate anyone else's house.  I -- I've done my mother's house.  I've done my cousin's house.  But when it comes to my house I --
L:  Does everybody like how you decorated?
R:  Yeah, they do.  I just --
L:  How 'bout asking them for ideas [several inaudible words] your house --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for your house then.  
R:  Yeah, I --
L:  Not that you have to use 'em but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- sometimes it's always better to get a second opinion.
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  More than your own.
R:  Well, my mother in law was here over the, um, holid- -- uh, Christmas holidays and she showed me -- well, put -- I have -- I mean, I have a whole room of -- of things to put on the wall, I just don't know where to put them.  So I just throw 'em in there.  She's like -- so she got 'em all out and she showed me.  "You should put this here and this there", so I have a few things up now but ...  And I've done my kitchen and my bathroom.  My kitchen and my bathrooms are done.  It's just the rest of the house is left undecorated.  [LAUGH]  It's [MN] --
L:  Well, you can always do like I do.  Grab the magazines --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and take pictures that -- of your pictures and replace them with what's on there.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well,  [LAUGH] --
L:  That way you're not having to put holes in your walls with -- and then you're like, "Well, I didn't really want that there".  
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  They do also have, um, CDs for -- do you have a computer?
R:  Yeah.
L:  They have CDs for the computer for, um, home remodelling.  [LIPSMACK]  Or, um, interior decorating.  Or you can take your own designs and your own pictures and put 'em in this.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And it has the different rooms of the house.
R:  That's --
L:  Since you seem to like to do that stuff it'd probably be worthwhile to invest in something like that.  Or to even check it out. 
R:  Wow.  That's pretty neat.  
L:  It is really neat.
R:  Huh.  I'll have to look --
L:  My girlfriend has it and she's like, "Oh, this has saved me so much time and e- effort".  
R:  Well, I'm going to have to look into that.  That sounds ...  Sounds pretty neat.  I bet you get those, like, at the -- the home improvement stores.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  I think that's right where she bought hers.  
R:  'Cause I -- I've -- I know I've seen the books there.  I just have never -- never seen --
L:  Well, now they have minor convenience called CDs.
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN] Oh, I'll have to look into that.  That's pretty neat.
L:  See you do have hobbies.  
R:  I do.
L:  You just don't want to tell nobody about 'em.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yes, I just -- I -- I guess I don't do it enough to -- to consider it a hobby.  But ...
L:  You will if you do more of it.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And you know most people it -- it's called a hobby it's because it's not a job.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  And you do still enjoy it?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Is this s- something you enjoy?
R:  Yeah, I do.  I mean, it -- it's --
L:  Then it's a hobby.
R:  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, see I learn something new everyday.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  And I'm -- I'm also a teacher so I do a lot of the --
L:  What do you teach?
R:  -- [MN] the crafty.  Second grade.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah, so I'm --
L:  Second graders are real fun.
R:  It -- it's a fun age.  They're -- they're not old enough to be -- to really -- to be real smart alecky and talk back but [MN] --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- but -- but they're old enough to n- not be such babies.  So it's a -- and it's an easy year in school.  I mean, and they're not having to learn.  It's like they're relearning --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what they learned in first grade.
L:  They're getting more social skills than anything else out of this.
R:  Ex- exactly.  Yeah, by the end of the year though, they're getting to be where they're -- they're starting to -- to be interested in boys, or -- or the girls are interested in boys and vice versa so, uh, that's --
L:  Okay, time for school year to end.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Have a good summer.  +Bye bye.
R:  Oh they -- [LAUGH] yeah.  
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, go home and bug your parents.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  All that kind of stuff, yeah.
L:  Ask mom and dad.
R:  Yeah.  But, um, yeah.
L:  Do you have kids?
R:  I have one daughter.  She's four.  
L:  Do you have your hobbies with her?
R:  Uh, we -- we do -- we -- we get out and we paint and we ...  Yeah.  Some.  Yeah.  She -- well, she's not a real big shopper either so ...
L:  That's okay.  
R:  That's kind of hard.  Do you have any kids?
L:  Yes, I do.  I have a twenty one year old.  I have, um, a fifteen year old.  Eleven year old.  And a ten year old.
R:  Wow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]  That's a wide range.
L:  [MN]  Very wide range.
R:  Bet they keep you busy.
L:  Pardon?
R:  I bet they keep you busy.
L:  Um, yeah, they do.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Including from the twenty one on down.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- the twenty one's in college and he's grown.  He's out on his own.
R:  Oh.
L:  I only see him, um, like on holidays, or every other weekend if he comes up to visit with me.  'Cause he lives down in the city.  Where are you from?
R:  Uh, we live in -- right outside of Dallas, Texas.
L:  Well, we live here in Michigan.
R:  Oh, okay.  
L:  And he lives in the big city and I live in the country.  
R:  Oh, okay.  So it ...
L:  I used to live in the big city and I moved to the country.  And since then we've purchased a home here, and so I only see him when and if he feels like it or wants to.
R:  Yeah.  But, yeah ...
L:  But he's a big help.  He knows I still like doing the flowers so ...  He gives me a hard time about it but he goes out of his way to help me out when he comes home.
R:  Well, that's nice.  That's nice.
L:  And he's gotten used to it 'cause I always have a project for him when he comes home.
R:  [LAUGH]  [NOISE]  [MN]
L:  He's like, "Okay, what do you got me building or making now?"
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Put him to work.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I'm like, "Oh, thank you".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Well, we live, um -- we live at -- we're right up north, um, from Dallas and so we live in a -- a suburb but it's -- it's still -- it's -- it's -- it's a suburb but it's the city.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, this is the smallest town I've ever lived in.  It has probably -- I want to say probably about fifty thousand people.  But it -- it's really nice to be at kind of a -- it's not in the country but we still have less than -- three or four blocks away we have horses and cows that are around us but, um, it's -- it's nice to actually [MN] see people that you know at the grocery store and not --
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  [MN]  Then in -- [MN] I've always lived in, you know, fairly good size cities and it's a -- it's a big change.
L:  Oh, it was a big change for me too, moving from the big city [MN].  I mean, I lived in Lo- -- I don't know if +you've ever heard Detroit, Michigan.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  'Cause I mean all the [MN] + that -- that town's talked about in movies and music, both.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, that's where I used to live.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And that is a big city.
R:  Yeah.
L:  We're right on the border of Canada.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  I mean one side of the Detroit River is Michigan.  The other side, once you go through the tunnel to get under-
