R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.  Hello.
R:  Hi.
L:  My name is Lois.
R:  Lois?
L:  Yes.
R:  Hi, I'm Linda.
L:  Hi, Linda.
R:  Hobbies.  Hobbies.  Hobbies.  Well, they won't -- don't wanna look at my house.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] What ...?
R:  No, I do -- I do, um, stamping.  I do scrap booking.  I do, um, decorative painting type stuff.
L:  Wow!  [LAUGH]  Um, how does -- do you have a family?
R:  Um, I have -- it's just my husband and I, but I have a daughter and I have three grandsons.
L:  Oh, okay.  Well, then you have room probably?  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, well, no.  [LAUGH]  We have a small one bedroom apartment and a lotta the problem with the -- the hobbies for me is storage.
L:  I bet it is.
R:  Yeah, 'cause I -- I -- I love paper.  So, I have tons of, uh, drawers with nothing but -- but cards stuck in them and I've got my stamps in stamp drawers and little things all over the place and [COUGH], um, but I've kinda sectioned it off and I've -- I've put like a credence sticking out with the bookcase on top so you can't see the crap [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- from the front door so ...  [LIPSMACK] But, uh ...
L:  Well, yeah, you need -- you need lots of little things for your hobbies.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I think that, you know -- and -- and, uh, one of the things they said is, do you think that people should have hobbies?  And, yeah, I think they should.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But I don't know -- I -- its -- I think it's individual for everyone.  For me it's stuff like this because I really enjoy the art part of it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I'm not an artsy person, but this is like instant art to me.
L:  It's creative though.  That's artistic.
R:  Yeah.  And I think that -- that it -- it adds a lot to people's lives when they can create something.  I mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be a hobby like scrap booking or stamping or whatever.  For guys a lot of it is, you know, home repairs and, you know, stuff like that, that ...
L:  Something I -- I think they get a feeling of accomplishment out of.
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  Seeing -- seeing results.
R:  Yeah.  The -- the saddest thing I think is now is they don't offer any arts and crafts for kids anymore --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- at least here for schools because, uh, they can't allocate the money for it.
L:  Wow!  Our --
R:  And ...
L:  -- our school does still have art.
R:  No, ours has no music --
L:  They have an art and structure.
R:  -- has no arts and crafts and I think that's a big loss because I think a lotta the kids get a -- a lot out of it. And, like you said --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- a feeling of accomplishment.
L:  Yeah.  I think -- I think they do.  I really do.  I think -- I know, um, all of our children have enjoyed the music programs --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, so much.  So ...
R:  And I think that it's been shown, and especially with music, that kids who are into music do well in math.
L:  They do well in lots -- in almost every other area.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, yeah, that's really good.  I really don't have what I would call hobbies, um, I just don't have time [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- to pursue them.  So ...  But, um, I think if I -- if I did, um, have a hobby it'd probably be something with, um [LIPSMACK] -- probably with sewing because I -- I always enjoyed --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- I really enjoyed sewing.
R:  Well, you know, clothing is really big now, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, well, a lot of the -- the things that -- I was, um, more or less a stamper --
L:  Mhm.
R: -- um, doing a lot of, you know, cards and stuff like that and then, of course, nine eleven came along and a lotta people started going back to family stuff and I'm thinking, you know, if something happens to me, you know, what are my grandsons gonna have?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know, they're just gonna know me from pictures of what my daughter has, which is not a lot and really nothing about my life [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- before I had my daughter.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  I really have -- have got, I guess --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- my mother into, um [NOISE], making quilts --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, and she -- she's, um, in her mid eighties and I don't know how many years ago she started, um, and she made each of us children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- an afghan for high school graduation and I told her how much it meant to me to have that --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and I said, you know, "When the other -- when, you know, like when we married and stuff, you know, it'd be really nice to have something that you made for each one of us" --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and so she has made each of her grandchildren, um, a handmade quilt for their high school graduation.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, it's ...
R:  And, you know -- and I think that that, uh -- you know, having something to do, something to create from scratch I think it, you know, adds --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- so much to people's lives.
L:  I think it not only adds to the enjoyment for the person doing it --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- but other people get so much out of it too.
R:  Definitely.  Definitely.  'Cause, you know, most of my cards I don't keep, I give them away, you know?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah.
R:  Or I sell some of 'em, depending.  I'm doing postcards now that are just so adorable.  But, um, you know, I mean, I can't make them all just for -- for people that I know.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I need to -- I need to be able to get some benefit out of it and if I can get a monetary benefit out of it every once and a while that's fine.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Yeah.  No, it's not --
R:  -- it's not a lot but, uh ...
L:  -- it's not limited to just benefits for family.
R:  Yeah.  But I think like with your Mom with quilting, my God, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- what a wonderful thing to -- to carry on and, you know, for the kids when she's gone.
L:  Yeah.  Something to have, like you say, you -- you know, a memento of her or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, yeah, I think that -- I know a friend of mine has a hobby of, um, collecting certain items --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, well, it's something that she and her husband can do together, um, he looks --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- you know, they -- they go different places and look for these things and ...  So, it's -- it's, you know, time together for one thing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and then they have the enjoyment of, um, they create displays for different community activities, um, so the community benefits, and then when they get tired of some things and they sell them and --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- they get a monetary benefit too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, there's a lotta people who take antiquing --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and going out and buying antiques, restoring 'em.  You know, that's a hobby for them.  I know --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- a couple of people who buy houses, you know, they -- they buy fixer uppers and their hobby is, you know, to gradually fix it up over the course of a few years and then they sell it and then move on to another house --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um, you know, some of the stuff they do is just gorgeous, you know, you would never think that, you know, the house didn't look that way, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  [LAUGH]
R:  But, I mean, there's just so much creativity that you can do and it doesn't -- doesn't necessarily have to be, you know, like an artsy thing, you know?
L:  And I think maybe why people enjoy it so much is because there's no pressure financially maybe --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- to benefit from it, you know?
R:  Well, it does -- it does to a certain point 'cause like for me you need to have certain supplies --
L:  Well, yes.
R:  -- and sometimes you can get the supplies at yard sales and stuff like that, depending like -- guys who do automotives, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- or work on their car it's a hobby for them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, of course, they're out looking for that kinda stuff.  People who do antiques, you know, go to yard sales and, you know, try and find stuff that way.  And with me it's, uh, you know, searching for forty percent coupons for Michael's, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I can get some of the stuff, or know when there's a really good sale on, uh -- on, uh, paper --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, scrap paper.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, so, uh, that I think has a good deal to do with it.  I mean, I put a lotta money in -- into my stuff because, I mean, there's so many things out there --
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  -- you know, that you can have for any one hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Well, I didn't mean -- I didn't mean that it didn't cost anything.  I meant that --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- like you're not dependent on it for your livelihood.
R:  No, that's true.  That's true.
L:  So, there's not that -- there's not that pressure of producing --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- uh, on your hobby, I mean ...
R:  Well, artists -- artists per se if that's what their thing is a lotta them live off of what they make selling a painting, you know?
L:  Oh, sure.
R:  So, that's -- that's, uh, something for them that they have to consider all this stuff.  And I think they were talking about the fact that a lot of the impressionable artists used to paint over their work --
L:  Mhm.  Right.
R:  -- and so sometimes you'll find something else underneath [LAUGH] the original painting --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- because they couldn't afford to buy another mat.
L:  Right.
R:  [COUGH] So ...  But, uh, yeah, I've done that to several of my cards.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, whatever makes it work, right?
R:  Pulling them apart and use it -- and use that ...  Yeah.  It's, um, you know, using a lotta different things and what I can find cheap and what I can reuse and, you know?  So, that's one thing I have to keep, you know -- because I've had to, um -- and so like a basket system.  Uh, we have a thing called the Container Store and it has things that you can use to arrange things and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so I have a whole line on part of my wall with nothing but baskets.  So, that's got a lot of my supplies in them.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And I still have tons of stuff [LAUGH], just stuffed away --
L:  I'm sure.
R:  -- you know?  But ...
L:  [MN] I think too that -- that hobbies, um [LIPSMACK], help people's outlook or perspective --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- if they have -- if they have a hobby that they like to do, I think that's a good, um, outlet for them --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I guess emotionally.
R:  Well, I think especially when people retire --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, 'cause a lotta people are so wrapped up into who they were at work, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  They are their job, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, then of course when you don't have it anymore a lot of -- you know, a lot of my friends, uh, who are retired feel that, you know -- you know, what use are they now, they don't have anything to go to --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, and at least with a hobby, you know, they have something that they can do.
L:  Right.  Right.  There's always there that ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know?
R:  I have, uh -- my -- my girlfriend, her husband collects trains --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and so he's always out running around looking for this and looking for that and it gives him something to do.
L:  Sure.
R:  You know?  He fixes this and -- and stuff like that.  So ...
L:  Well, if you're -- yeah, it -- it gives the person goals.
R:  Mhm.  [PAUSE]  Excuse me.  I had to drink some soda.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My throat was getting kinda rough.
L:  Yep.
R:  Um, yeah, I think that, um, with, uh, the aspect of, uh, the creativeness on it, um, it helps a lot because like you said it's, you know, the satisfaction of knowing that -- that you did this --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that you've taken it from whatever -- whatever manner you -- you got -- you know, you bought it and you put it all together and created this -- this masterful piece.
L:  That's right.
R:  Whatever it may be, a quilt, a card, you know, or a scrap of page, you know, an automotive, you know --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- because, I mean, boy, I'll tell ya some of these guys, you know, they were talking about Jay Lennell[?] the other night that he collects cars and that's all he does is he looks through 'em for spare parts for these cars --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and some of them are pretty expensive.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] But it -- it's just amazing what they can do, you know, with all these various pieces and then --
R:  Well, I had gone to --
L:  -- what it looks like when they're done.
