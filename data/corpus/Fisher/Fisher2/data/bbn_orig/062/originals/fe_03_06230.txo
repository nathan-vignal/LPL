R:  Hi, I'm Leigh.
L:  [NOISE] Hi, I'm Denise.
R:  Hi, Denise.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  Um, do you have any hobbies?
L:  [NOISE]  Uh, yeah, I usually like lots of outdoor things, like fishing and --
R:  Do you?
L:  -- [LIPSMACK] swimming.  Things like that.
R:  Oh, that's --
L:  Other than that I don't really have any real hobbies like sewing or [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- you know.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  The constructive stuff.  [LAUGH] 
R:  I know.  I'm the opposite.  My husband likes the outdoor things and my children do, and so I'm often at the ball field and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- outdoors with them, but I like indoor things.  I like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- decorating my home and sewing.  And, um, thinking of more construction jobs for my husband to do at our home.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Just coming up with different, um, different ideas for him.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I also do drama with our church and, um, and so that's really a hobby also.  Is --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- doing drama and working on skits and ...
L:  Huh.
R:  Which is a lot of fun and I've somehow got my daughter and my husband roped into that also.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  So even though, um, you know, they would much prefer to be outside as well.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, do you think that everyone should have a hobby?
L:  Oh, definitely.  
R:  That's [MN] --
L:  I think you need hobbies in order to -- things that you enjoy in order to keep your sanity.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, absolutely.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes, I think that, um, it [SIGH] even though -- I don't know, do you find you have a lot of time to enjoy your hobbies?
L:  Not really.  
R:  That's --
L:  I mean, I guess lately I have but normally I wouldn't.  I guess -- I'm not working right now, you know, but when I am working I -- I don't.  'Cause I have kids too and ...
R:  Right.
L:  They've got their things and [MN] they usually come first.
R:  Well, absolutely.  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, they're only little once.  They grow up too fast -- 
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LAUGH] to -- to -- 
L:  Mm.
R:  -- to miss out on all that but that's, um, [several inaudible words] you know, I'm looking and sitting in my family room looking at my sewing machine set up and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, my drapes are half done for the [LAUGH] family room --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  And do I have time?  Oh, well, I home school our -- our youngest daughter and so between that and -- and I work part time and [MN] you know, yeah, I try to fit it in but --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but it's hard and, um, but -- but, like I said, with drama, that usually helps because sort of required to go to those.  You know.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, everybody's dependent on you showing up to practice --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and things.  And doing your part.  So I guess that forces me to do that.  But --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, I'd like to get into scrapbooking as a hobby, but I just have not had the time to even, you know, I bought some things.  My daughter and I were gonna do it and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And we wound up -- and I think that was six months ago.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Wow. 
R:  [LAUGH]  Haven't done -- haven't done anything with it yet.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  So we need to, um -- because I think that looks like fun.  Now you probably wouldn't enjoy that because you -- being outdoors and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- enjoying that part of it.  
L:  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Unless you could do it outside.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  Certain things like that, you know, indoor stuff, I -- I don't mind doing that either.  I mean [MN] -- I'm from Minnesota so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I don't really enjoy the outdoors as much in the winters and so I have to find something to do inside and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- things like that, you know, interest me too.
R:  That's -- course this winter wasn't that bad for you.  It --
L:  No, it wasn't.
R:  You could enjoy the outside.  I live on the east coast in Delaware and this winter we had -- my sister lives in South Dakota and [LAUGH] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we had a much, you know --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- worse winter than she did.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So at least she could enjoy the outside this summer, uh, this winter and, um, get some of that in and, um ...  That is difficult though, you know, when you live in an area that you're dependent on the climate to have hobbies that are outdoor hobbies, like you were saying, biking --
L:  Mhm
R:  -- and things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You know, in January, I'm sure it's difficult for you to get out there and do it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So you probably appreciate those activities more so than someone who lives here because [MN] our weather tends to be fairly mild.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, you know, even in the wintertime and normally.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, you know, so you do have an opportunity to get out and, um, do a few things and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [LIPSMACK] and, uh, but and -- and it's not that I don't enjoy outside.  I enjoy activities outside it's just, um, [SIGH] I guess I'm better at indoor things.  You know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'm not really great at gardening and [MN] my kids tell me not to touch anything in a plant store 'cause it'll shrivel up and die once I buy it.
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]  So I think [MN] -- I -- and maybe that's it.  People tend to lean to hobbies that maybe they're better at too.
L:  Yeah.  Mhm.
R:  [MN]  You know.  If you're better at athletics, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, and so I guess [MN] marrying my husband has kept me, sort of, forced to be outside when --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I'd probably be inside all the time.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Doing things. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, but, um ...  So what [MN] um -- do your children tend to have the same hobbies you do?  In that --
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  They're really into sports though.  I -- I don't do much for sports.
R:  Mhm.
L:  You know, but I have two boys so ...
R:  Mm.
L:  [COUGH]  My -- one son is in soccer and he's going to be in softball and -- and all that.
R:  Right.
L:  Um ...
R:  That's -- yeah.  That's, um -- my husband's a soccer official and so he's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, often out there and -- and, uh -- and with two boys you're probably just -- if you're like my sister who also has two [LAUGH] boys and, you know, every season it's something that her kids are into.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And so, you know, your hobby is cheering them on and being their support.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  Which is important and they need that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, oh my daughter, you know, our -- our youngest -- her big thing is softball so --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- we're right out there with her and cheering her on and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- [MN] it's -- it's really good.  [LIPSMACK]
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, um -- I enjoy that part of it.  Enjoyed it when our other -- our two older ones who are, you know, now out of college --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, were in it and their dad, you know, helped and we were always real involved in it.  [LIPSMACK]  So it's -- it's been fun to watch them.  But that's what I said, your kids --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- are young, just -- it's not very long.  You know.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.
R:  Because --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- now ours are -- two of them are grown.  I think it makes me appreciate our youngest one even more [LAUGH] because --
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  -- I realise our fast, you know, those --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- those days of being out at the ball field.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  And how quickly they go.  And they do that really quick so ...
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  That's, um -- you'll have plenty of time for your other hobbies but, I mean, I guess I -- that's how I feel.
L:  [NOISE]  Brierley --
R:  You know, I have --
L:  I'm on the phone.
R:  -- plenty of time for my other hobbies.  My daughter does -- I feel like teaching her how to sew.  [several inaudible words] important things so --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, in drama we've done --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- some [inaudible] and she sewed her own outfit, so I sort of pull her in a little bit into my hobbies and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [MN] and I -- [MN] you know, well, she won't let me pitch to her 'cause I hit her so I -- I'm not [LAUGH] real [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
L:  Mhm.
R:  [LAUGH]  To coach her [LAUGH] [several inaudible words] [LAUGH] to cheer her on and -- and, you know, be team mom or whatever it takes to be involved and that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So it's a [MN] -- it's really a lot of fun. 
L:  Mhm.  And I think with kids too, you -- you pretty much need to introduce them to many different hobbies so they can figure out what they like the best and -- and what they're good at, and what not, and ...
R:  That's true.  Yeah.  I know our daughter played basketball last winter because she wanted to keep in shape.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So she would be better for softball.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And she [MN] really found out that that wasn't her thing, you know.  And she's tried soccer before and that really wasn't her thing and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- she just seems to enjoy and excel, um, at softball.  You know.
L:  Huh.
R:  It's really something that she enjoys and -- and, um, again, you know I said I -- I kind of brought her into my hobby of drama but she kind of brought me into her.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  She is really the one who wanted to try out first and I got hooked.  And she -- then again she excels at that as well.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, um, [LIPSMACK] -- but it's something I think if -- if you will have certain things you enjoy, there are hobbies you can have together.
L:  Mhm.
R:  It makes it a lot of fun and ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, again, my sister with two boys, you know, she's out cheering them on but they also do a lot of activities again.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And you know -- she's -- she doesn't like to go camping.  I guess that is one hobby.  I do -- we haven't done it for a while but I do like camping and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, and so does our daughter so, um, you know, that's something that we can enjoy outside and nature walks, you know, things like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So that's really nice.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, [MN] I [MN] -- I don't know.  Uh ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't know if you've noticed.  I've had people talking to me [MN] pretty much the whole time.
R:  That's fine.
L:  [MN]  It's hard to get on the phone [MN] it seems like many times --
R:  It -- it -- it is.
