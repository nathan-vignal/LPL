R:  Hello?
L:  Hello?
R:  Hi.
L:  Hi.  This is Connie.
R:  Connie, hi.  This is Lyn.
L:  Hi.
R:  How ya doing?
L:  Okay.  How are you?
R:  Good thanks.  Do you wanna go first or do you want me to?  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, this is the first time I've done this.  So, why don't you go first?
R:  I haven't done it either, but I'll go first.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I -- I really don't have any hobbies.  My hobbies are my children.  So, I guess that is kind of a hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, and I spend twenty four seven with them.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, but we, uh, enjoy playing soccer.  My boys are on, um, a soccer team.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, that's -- that's like a hobby for us 'cause we --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we go and play, um -- I watch them play, we go to tournaments and, um, we also go to our local, um, indoor soccer team.  We have a -- a local professional team --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and we go and watch them play every once in a while.  So, um, we really enjoy ourselves and, um, if I would have a hobby [SIGH], like outside of my children I guess, um, you need to have your own time.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I mean, some -- it's very hard if you work and you have children and you have a husband, um, to -- to get your own time and -- and enjoy yourself in your own hobby, but I would say, um, to get away at least once a week if you could, you know, to enjoy yourself; if not once a month.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um -- but, um, I guess I like gardening 'cause when the kids aren't here I -- I do a lotta that too.
L:  Okay.  Well, I've -- I've just gone back into gardening --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- after a couple of years, I was just too busy with everything else, um, and I guess -- like, my hobbies are like knitting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I've been doing that since I was eight years old and ...
R:  From -- since you were eight?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Wow!
L:  And I taught myself.  So, it's like basic -- I can -- I can pick up a pattern and try and figure out what -- how to do it, how it'll all come out when I'm looking at a picture, um, and couponing.
R:  Couponing, yes.  Well, I -- I like to do that too.  [LAUGH]
L:  I found out -- I found out that's an actual hobby from going online and seeing all these peop- women that do it.
R:  Yes.
L:  Oh, okay, that's my hobby.  All right.  Well, I've been doing that for a year too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Right.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  I do that every Sunday.  I'm not as involved as other people, um, I don't spend extra money to get coupons or anything like that.  So ...
L:  Well, I do sometimes.  It depends upon -- like my local paper doesn't have good coupons.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I buy the Cleveland paper or the Pittsburgh paper.  They have better coupons.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'll spend more money, but I can double those coupons.  I can make it -- make it ahead.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, you live by Cleveland?
L:  Uh, right between Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
R:  Oh.
L:  It's called Youngstown.
R:  Oh, I know where Youngstown is.  Uh-huh.  Um, I am north of York, Pennsylvania.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I know where that is too.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, we're kinda close?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Neighbors.  So, um, have you been doing these surveys, um, with other companies before?
L:  No.  Not on the telephone.
R:  No.
L:  I do 'em maybe once in a while on the Internet.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Though, um, my favorite four are Pine Cone, Lease It Online, and a couple of other ones.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I just, uh -- Pine Cone just sends you something --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and say, you know, do this survey and you'll get five dollars.  Okay, no problem.
R:  Well, I -- I think that's a hobby too.
L:  Yeah.  I like that.
R:  Yeah, 'cause you get paid for doing it.
L:  Mhm. 
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I -- I, um -- I enjoy doing that.  I took a couple of surveys online.  So, I would consider that a hobby.  [LAUGH]  Um ...
L:  Well, then -- well, then computers too.
R:  What's that?
L:  Doing that -- that computer stuff online --
R:  Oh, right.
L:  -- that's sort of a hobby, right?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I mean, and there's lots of hobbies if you would think about, um -- really think about it.  A lotta things could be hobbies and you don't even realize it.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, some people like watching T.V. [LAUGH] as a hobby, you know?  Um ...
L: Well, see, I do that while I'm knitting.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm doing that right now as I'm talking to you because, um, I told, um, my cousin who answered the phone, I said, "If it's important I can't talk 'til after nine o'clock".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, um, I -- once she said it's Fisher, I'm like oh, my goodness!  That's a phone survey.  I have to call -- I have a big call.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I have to do that.  So, yeah, um -- but, um, this -- this is my first survey.  So, I'm not exactly sure how, um ...
L:  I'm not sure exactly either what -- what's really expected.
R:  Yep.
L:  I know you're supposed to talk to a stranger about something.
R:  Right.
L: That's about it.
R:  Right.  And they said about -- talking about a hobby --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, introducing yourself, um, what hobbies do you do and for how long do you do it?  Well -- I mean, how many hours a week do you do it and, um -- and then there was another question.  I think we've already answered that one.  But, like, you know, what happens if you don't -- you can't talk long about that specific --
L:  Right.
R:  -- hobby, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.
R:  So ...  But, um, like I ...
L:  Well, what kinda -- you garden, do you garden a flower garden or a vegetable garden?
R:  Um, I am doing a flower garden.  I don't have vegetables, um, I don't have a -- we have a pool in our back yard.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, I don't have enough room for -- for vegetables but, um ...
L:  Do you know what I've learned cause I don't have a big back yard?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I have merely, um -- my -- it's a two car garage and, uh, that actually takes up most of the back yard --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and what I'm doing is just getting a little container --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and putting all my vegetables in containers.
R:  Oh!  Huh.
L:  And then that way if -- if I don't like it, it doesn't work out, I can move 'em around.
R:  Right.
L:  If there's -- if there's, um, a frost warning I can pull 'em inside the garage, it's no problem --
R: Right.
L:  -- take 'em back out.
R:  Now, what kind of pots do you put them in?
L:  Um, well, I bought, um -- some -- well, maybe, um, eighteen inches high, just some decorative plant --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- things at Wool Mart.
R:  Oh, okay.  Like, either a pot -- a clay pot or a plastic pot?
L:  Plastic.
R:  Plastic, uh-huh.
L:  Just -- just lightweight.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  And I got a couple of bushes that I put in.  So, the -- the plastic pot that those came in comes down into it and I'll put those into use.
R:  Oh, wow!  Now, I tried having, um, patio tomatoes last year, but it just didn't seem to work.  They, um -- I guess it was too hard for 'em --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it ...
L:  Yeah, last year as hot for everything.
R:  Yeah.  So, um -- so I was a little weary about buying them again but, um, that might be a good idea to put 'em lower instead of up high on the deck.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Hm.
L:  Um, what I'm gonna end up doing is plant- planting ten tomato plants per pot --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and it says only -- only plant one.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Well, I figured the first couple of years see how it grows and if it comes down to only having one or two or just grow [several inaudible words].  So, I just kept 'em growing and put the, um -- the wire tomato thing on --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and then it just grew inside of it.  I just was very dense.
R:  Now, did you grow them from seeds?
L:  Um, no, because my son is autistic and if he would see the dirt inside the house --
R:  He would wanna dig?
L:  -- he'd wanna dig --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and throw it all over.  So, I ended up buying just really small tomato plants.
R:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yes.  I'm very aware of that, um, I work, um, for, um, a learning support class that has, um, children with, uh, autism.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I -- I know all about those little --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- things that we have to do and not do.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, we have to adjust our life.
R:  Mhm.  That's right.  That's right.  Well, I didn't -- I never thought about growing 'em like that, but I'm going to have to give that a try.  What else have you, um, put in pots to grow?
L:  Mainly just tomatoes because he will eat the tomatoes off the -- off the vine.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So, it comes down to it and I'm out there picking the tomatoes he'll be out there right next to me picking them and eating them too.
R:  Okay.  So, are they cherry tomatoes?
L:  [NOISE] Yeah, usually cherry.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  You can hear him rocking in the background?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Oh.  Okay.  'Cause I, um -- my bigger plants I usually plant in between my, um -- my trees that I have grow- --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- going down the side of my house and it was really hot for them last year.  So, um, I didn't get very many tomatoes outta them.  In fact, most of 'em dry rotted or --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- got brown on the bottom before I could even pick 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, I'm not sure if that was too much water or not enough water.
L:  [NOISE] I'm not sure.  I -- I just basically use a watering can --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and use the America Grow tomato plant.
R:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.
L:  I think just whatever, just twice a week or once a week --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- whatever it says on there and at the beginning I would water 'em twice a day and then once they -- I could see like blooms on 'em --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I'd cut down to maybe once a day.
R:  Oh, okay.  All right.  'Cause we don't usually plant our, um, tomatoes until after Memorial Day.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, I, um -- 'cause it's a little bit more cooler here --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, and that's when they always told us to plant them.  So, I guess, um, I can try those, um, on my, um, patio.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I'll have to give that a try.
L:  Okay.
R:  Just the little cherry tomatoes.  Yeah.  Hm.  [LIPSMACK]  And I guess maybe peppers you could put in -- in the, um ...
L:  Yeah, peppers and I just started peas this year.
R:  Peas, like snap peas?
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Oh.  Hm.  Uh, does that need, um -- are they the ones that grow up a vine?
L:  Yeah.  They'll just use a tomato -- tomato stakes again --
R:  Ah, okay.
L:  -- to -- to go up.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  'Cause you could stick them right in the container and they could grow up those little sides.
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, wow!  I didn't think of that.
L:  Um, cucumbers I've heard -- I tried it one year and they didn't grow very big.
R:  Okay.
L:  So ...
R:  Now, would you use tomato stakes for them too?
L:  No, 'cause they grow down along the ground --
R:  Oh, the ground.
L:  -- and the -- the cucumbers are too heavy.
R:  Hm.  Yeah.  That would be -- that's right.  Hm.
L:  But I don't know what else.
R:  I would like to plant strawberries.
L:  You know, I started that this year too.
R:  But, um, they take up a lotta room.
L:  I put them in a hanging basket.
