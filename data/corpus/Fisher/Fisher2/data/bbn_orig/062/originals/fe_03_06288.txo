R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, if you go into the website [NOISE] -- if you go into the website that you signed up at --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it -- well, actually it was something when they said [NOISE] -- did they send you an email with your pin number?
R:  Yeah.
L:  It -- it says on it they're looking for men.
R:  Oh, great.
L:  So, you can refer your, um -- anybody in your family and you get an extra five dollars and they're -- and it doesn't -- it doesn't say you can't [NOISE] --
R:  [LAUGH] Cute.
L:  -- and it doesn't say they can't be family members.
R:  [COUGH] Well, cool.
L:  So, my husband's done a couple, you know?
R:  Well, I've got a couple of people that would like that.
L:  Yes.  And they want men --
R:  Cool.
L:  -- 'cause it's mostly women.
R:  Yeah, it is.
L:  I mean, I did one the other day with a man [NOISE] and it was about, uh, online games --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I'm like okay, I don't know this one, but you know ...?  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, that's cute.
L:  So, okay, crafts.  Crafts.  Well, hobbies, yes.
R:  Hobbies.
L:  So, tell me what do you -- what do you do with your crafting?
R:  Uh, I give 'em as gifts or just keep 'em.  I have so little time.  My -- 
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- my little man is four --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I have so little time now.  I think I probably spend half an hour a month crafting, and I haven't painted anything in forever.  So ...
L:  Now, do you work?
R:  Ah, I work part time.
L:  Okay.
R:  For two and a half days a week and, uh ...
L:  What do you do?
R:  I'm a graphic designer.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I guess I ...
L:  Well, you are very talented and crafty.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm kind of a crafty person.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I enjoy it.
L:  Well, I just actually painted, uh, parts of my house this weekend.  So --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- I would say that that is crafty --
R:  Oh, definitely. 
L:  -- 'cause I've never painted in my entire life and my Dad he was just a -- a painter -- I mean, he painted.
R:  Mhm.
L:  He was just a painter.  He painted homes.  He painted and -- and I never picked up a paintbrush and I finally did.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I've been painting some walls in my home because I'm bored.
R:  There you go.
L:  I'm bored with white walls.
R:  There you go.
L:  And so I picked out a color and just started to paint and my husband's like, "Um, I have a feeling we're gonna have some really interesting rooms here" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and I said, "I think so.  This is fun".  I mean, how else can you transform a room or -- I mean, it's like --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- for twenty bucks I painted -- you know, two gallons of paint and painted everything.
R:  There you go.
L:  Yeah.
R:  There you go.  That's kinda my hobby too is doing the house.  We're ...
L:  Yeah.  Well -- and I just learned that by just painting a wall it totally transforms everything around it.
R:  Oh, the whole room.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, it does.
L:  Because I have these purp- -- these purple chairs and I painted the walls kind of this, uh -- I don't know -- it's -- it called Secret Garden Green and it's just -- just pretty --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- the -- the way it kinda pops and I'm like okay, I've found my own my niche is obviously painting.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Painting.  [MN]
R:  Well, green is my favorite color see.
L:  Oh, I love green.
R:  Oh, it's my favorite.
L:  You know?  And I went to the -- a home depot and picked out about eighteen thousand paint things and brought them home --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- and obsessed about it for two days and I said okay, just -- and I narrowed it down --
R:  That's funny.
L:  -- and just picked one and said I'm gonna with that one.
R:  Cool.
L:  Yeah.  Green and purple those are my favorite colors.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  I've got some paint for our bedroom that is like --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a coral color --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I have never put any color that dramatic on a wall and so I'm getting ready to do it.  I'm really excited about it.
L:  To do your bedroom?
R:  Uh-huh.  It's for our bedroom.
L:  Cool.
R:  It's a real -- it's a restful color.
L:  Yes.
R:  It's not a vibrant, but --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- but it is coral.  So, it's kind of a -- a change for us too.  So ...
L:  No.  That will be nice.
R:  Yeah, it'll be fun.
L:  You know, 'cause even when I -- when I watch those Trading Spaces [NOISE] they do it like red --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- in the bedroom and I think no, no, no --
R:  No.
L:  -- you don't want red in your bedroom.
R:  No.  Not red.
L:  You don't want, you know -- you just -- you couldn't relax in that one.
R:  I wouldn't think so.  No.
L:  No.
R:  But ...
L:  I mean, I had -- I had red in my bedroom when I was a kid.
R:  Ugh, I wouldn't like that.
L:  Yeah.  I -- for some reason I wanted it.  I was like I want a red room.
R:  Huh.
L:  My parents were probably thinking okay, she's probably mentally ill.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  She needs a red room.
R:  Yeah.  But you didn't ask for gray ceilings?
L:  No.
R:  They did gray ceilings on one Trading Spaces and I was just like oh, that's so bad.
L:  Well, yeah.  I'm not really into -- I mean, I -- you -- you kinda paint the walls and -- and -- yeah -- and -- and when you do your ceilings that's what I've noticed it brings your whole room down, you know, and some of it's --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- kinda cool.  I've -- I've seen some where they put like stars on the ceiling, which is -- it sort of looks like you're looking at night time when -- when you turn the lights off --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- it's like the stars are shining.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been thinking about putting those on my son's roof.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That'd be really fun.
L:  Oh, my gosh, he'd love those.
R:  [NOISE] He would.  He would.  But, you know, sometimes stuff like that kinda ...
L:  Is that him talking to you?
R:  Huh?
L:  Is that him talking to you?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  He's -- he is up out of his bed and he should be in bed.  Uh, but, uh -- yeah, we've -- that's really the only hobby I have time for --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is between, you know, dec- -- trying to keep the house decorated and making sock puppets.  Now, we did make sock puppets tonight.
L:  Oh, how fun.
R:  So, a lot of my hobbies have -- have been more geared towards a four year old level, you know?
L:  Yes.
R:  It's amazing how you change.
L:  I don't have kids.  I have two stepsons, but they're older and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- uh, they're into hunting and camping and fishing and --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I -- I've no interest in that.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, it's like, you know, unless they ever want to play Monopoly --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- occasionally, but ...
R:  There you go.
L:  Now, where in Kentucky are you?
R:  I'm in Bowling Green, Kentucky.
L:  Bowling Green, Kentucky.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, my gosh!
R:  Beautiful Bowling Green.
L:  I have never been to Kentucky.
R:  Oh, you gotta.
L:  But that's a very famous name, Bowling Green, Kentucky.
R:  Mhm.  That's where the ...
L:  I mean, when people think of Kentucky they think of Bowling Green, Kentucky.
R:  It's, uh, the only place in the world where the Corvette is made if you're a car fan.
L:  Really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow!
R: Yep.  That's where it's made.
L:  One of the few, um, American cars that are actually American made, you know?
R:  Yeah, very few.
L:  Like the Harley Davidson.
R:  Right.
L:  The same for the Corvette.
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, that's pretty neat.
R:  [NOISE] But, um -- but, yeah ...
L:  There's also a fragrance, I think it was Perry Ellis.
R:  Uh-huh.  Bowling Green.
L:  Is it Bowling Green?
R:  Yeah, one of my very favorite men.
L:  I used to sell men's -- I used to sell men's fragrances.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  And that was one that was -- like one of my popular fragrances.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  People loved that one.
R:  I couldn't do it.  I would be, you know, stroking their neck or something by --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- the time I'd got done.  Those fragrances are very powerful to me.
L:  Yes.
R:  But, uh -- but, yeah ...  So, we're -- it's beautiful here and it's -- and -- and Kentucky is a very hobby craft orientated place.
L:  Yes.
R:  You can't go anywhere on the weekend in the fall without hitting a craft fair.
L:  Well, just your voice, you're like the southern belle.
R:  [LAUGH] Thank you.
L:  You're so -- there is.
R:  I've very worked very hard to get rid of that accent.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  That's perfect.
R:  But, uh, the -- the madder I get the -- the more the accent comes out.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  I know there's -- that's what they're studying in this study.  So, hopefully they'll ...
L:  Different ...
R:  Different linguistic ...
L:  Yeah.  I know.  That's what I thought.  They're not -- not necessarily studying the topic --
R:  Right.
L:  -- you know, and that's --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- the thing.  They were just giving us something to talk about.
R:  Right.  Right.  I realized for a long, uh -- like the second call --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I heard him say ling- --
