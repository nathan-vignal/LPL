R:  Summer.
L:  My name is Christy.
R:  Hi.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Hi.  [LAUGH]  
R:  Are we just --
L:  I can barely hear [LAUGH] you.
R:  Okay.  [LAUGH]  So I guess I should move closer to the base.  [LAUGH]  Um ...
L:  Oh, am I on a speaker phone?
R:  No.
L:  Oh, [LAUGH] when you said the --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- base.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I just need to get closer to the -- this phone doesn't work that well.  [LAUGH]  
L:  So what kind of hobbies do you do?
R:  Well, I enjoy crocheting.  And, um ...
L:  Oh, so do I.
R:  I like to sing.  And those are my two main -- I like to read a lot too.
L:  Now are you naming off my hobbies or your hobbies?
R:  [LAUGH]  I don't know your hobbies.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Those are [inaudible] sound like my hobbies.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, wow.  How much -- how -- what kind of things do you crochet?
L:  Um, I do b- -- mainly blankets.  Um, I was taught as a, uh, young child, and just the basic stitching --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of crocheting and I was never really taught how to, you know, do all those little fancy little loops and inner rolls and --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, granny score type deals, and so I just -- I kindly, mainly, adjust and, uh, toy around with it, I should say.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [COUGH]  Depending on what size needle I want, um. I know currently I'm pregnant so I did a baby blanket in just the softest material and I thought, " [MN] wow.  Why didn't I use this material [LAUGH] before?"  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Wow.  I'm -- I'm the same.  I like to -- I do blankets a lot.  Um, I make baby blankets a lot of the time but lately I've been making full blankets.  I don't really know any fancy stitches, but I'm pretty creative on how I use the simple stitches that I know.  Um, so I have a lot of fun doing that.  So ...  What -- where do you sing normally?
L:  Oh, well, I just kind of [MN] main- mainly here lately sing to my baby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  That's a good place to [MN].
L:  Um, I know I tried out, uh, one time before at a talent search and it just -- that was, I guess, enough f- for me for a while to hold me, you know, content.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Um, but outside of that I don't do much public speaking.  I know I did younger, uh, when I was younger in my church and, um, singing songs in front of them.  [LIPSMACK]  But, uh, I'm grown up and got married and I mainly just sing for myself and for my baby and my stepdaughter and my husband and ...  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I have a quite little small choir [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- of audience.
R:  That's cool.  That's pretty much how I started out.  Actually the first time I ever really rememb- remember singing was my parents bought me the record to Annie and my mom said that she didn't know I could sing until she heard me singing all the songs on that record and -- and then after that, um, I think I was fourteen when I finally decided to sing solo, and from then on I sang a lot at church and, um, and then, like, I've sung at a few weddings and a couple of funerals.  And, um, so that kind of singing.  I -- now I just -- I sing when people ask me to.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Or, like, if my friends want to go out, I don't like to drink but, um -- so they can drink and I'll sing.  
L:  [MN]  That --
R:  That kind of thing.
L:  That works for me.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It kind a -- it's, uh, kind a the way it is.  You know.  I walk in, ask 'em what they want me to sing and I'll sing then or, um ...  I sing in the shower or, [LAUGH] you know, I like to worship a lot and that's one way that I -- I enjoy worshiping.  So ...  And that happens just anywhere.  Sometimes I don't even realise I'm doing [LAUGH] it.  So ...
L:  Isn't it amazing when you just -- you just go along at it and all of a sudden -- and I -- I found worshiping is the easiest thing to sing.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I mean --
R:  Well --
L:  -- I have --
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have -- I grew up at a really strict religion and you weren't allowed to listen to anything --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- outside of that religion.
R:  Oh, no.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Even if it had a -- a rocky beat you weren't allowed to listen to it.
R:  Oh, I couldn't function.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, uh, I got older and I said, "No! I'm not doing this."  
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And -- which didn't approve to my parents.
R:  [COUGH]
L:  Because they think, "Oh, well, you sing it so great".  And that's about all the extent of they got of, you know, encouraging me to sing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, and so -- but now I, um, [LIPSMACK] I find it's the most easiest thing to sing.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, but I do enjoy singing other things 'cause it's such a variety out there right now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, uh, well, right now I can't sing much of anything 'cause I've got a sinus [LAUGH] infection.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I hate it when that happens.  Actually it's good to sing even when you're sick.  Because, um, it -- your muscles get -- you let your muscles get tired if you stop.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- even if you don't sound good [LAUGH] it's good to hum a li- a little something.  [LAUGH]  Unless you really just can't talk at [LAUGH] all.  [LAUGH]
L:  No, I -- I can still do that.  I [MN] -- my husband said I had to -- I know a while back I got sick and lost my voice for two weeks.  He said I still didn't shut up.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So I -- I guess I -- I would consider talking a hobby too.
R:  Yeah.  I guess so.
L:  Because I enjoy it.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, it's nice to hear other people's opinions too.  
L:  Oh, yeah. 
R:  So and -- sometimes you're surprised at the co- -- at the things you have in common with somebody.  Even with somebody you've never met.  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  It's like --
R:  So ...
L:  It's when you started naming off your hobbies, I'm thinking --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- is she naming off hers or mine?
R:  [LAUGH]  I know.  So, yeah, I know, I und- -- I -- I -- it was interesting that you said you were from a very strict religion 'cause I -- I was raised in a southern Baptist church and they're -- they're pretty conservative and, um, [LAUGH] I remember being laughed at because whenever I was given a chance to pick my own music I remember, you know, having my hair in little braids of beads and, you know, dressing like a rapper and doing --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- [inaudible] talk with my girlfriend and ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  And my --
L:  The total opposite of what your parents, I'm sure, wanted.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  I know.  And I was only allowed to sing those songs on certain Sundays and -- and, like, if I was going to sing at certain, um, certain services then I had to take a more conservative one and [LAUGH] so it was -- that was always frustrating and so now I kind of like that I only sing when I'm asked to.  Or if I'm by myself and, um, I used to work in a daycare and I used to sing those kids to sleep and that was always fun.  Some of my best memories are singing to people.  Even my best -- my friends that when they would stay the night I would either [MN] talk them or sing them to sleep every night.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I can just keep going and going.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'm -- I'm y- your -- your almost telling my life story here.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  'Cause I --
R:  It's kind of funny.
L:  -- used to work at a daycare and I do the same thing to my kids.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that's what my husband said.  He said, "You just talk to me to sleep".  He says, "You just keep on talking.  You don't --"
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  "-- even know I'm sleeping yet".  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I had a -- I had, um -- I was babysitting one time and the -- there were two boys and the older boy loved for me to sing, and the younger boy I started singing and he looked at me and said, "Stop singing".  
L:  [MN]
R:  And I just laughed because I knew that it was -- he didn't want to go to sleep.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he knew [LAUGH] that if I kept singing he would fall [LAUGH] asleep.
L:  Smart boy.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  Smart boy. 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [COUGH]
R:  What kind of books do you like to read?
L:  Um, I actually [MN] the author that I, uh, really enjoy is Richard Paul Evans.
R:  [MN]
L:  Uh, he does the Carousel and the Locket and the Treasure Box.  Um ...
R:  [MN]  I just read the Treasure Box.  I -- I think that's what it was.  No, it was the Christmas Box that I just [LAUGH] read.  [LAUGH]  Never mind.
L:  I think that one's his too.
R:  Really?  It was -- yeah, it was a -- that was a book that my nanna let me borrow and it was really cool, cool story.  It was very neat.  I -- I --
L:  You have to check it out 'cause he's, uh, he's got a very, uh, good series. 
R:  [MN]
L:  The original book that he started off with -- I kind a jumped in the middle.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And started reading one [MN] -- one after and then I'd go to the one before and then the one after [LAUGH] the one before.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So it was really [LAUGH] confusing by the end of the storyline.  
R:  Oh, well ...
L:  But it originally -- he started out as originally writing a story for his little girl.
R:  That's cool.
L:  And then got it published. 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  And then -- and it just went from there --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and it just took off and he's got, like, four, I -- 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about six books now that all --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- kind of entangle together.
R:  [NOISE]  That is so neat.
L:  'Cause like in his second book he'll mention a name and he'll give some, you know, description on it as to what happened and, you know, he just doesn't leave that name ha- -- standing there, but in his next book he'll bring that name in more. 
R:  Mm.
L:  Or he'll focus on that name and bring some other people and -- and you're going, "Oh, now I know why that person fits --"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  "-- in here".
R:  So it kind of forces you to have to read in sequence?
L:  Right.  It does.  That's --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- why I was so confused.  I'm going --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- "Well who's this person?"  Or, "Who in the world is that person?  If that person and that pe- -- who's that person?"
R:  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah, I don't usually pick a certain author, or even a certain type of book.
L:  [COUGH]
R:  Um, I really enjoy Louise May Alcott from my childhood.  And I still read her stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  'Cause I really like the way she -- well, I like that time period because even when they talk about touchy subjects --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're not, like, too risque.  'Cause --
L:  Right.
R:  -- back then they could only hint but they never told too much.  And I appreciate [LAUGH] that.  You know.  [MN]
L:  You know it is.  [MN]  'Cause it -- it keeps you -- at one [MN] --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- it -- it heightens 
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- your imagination to use it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Because you're not just, you know, [inaudible] [LAUGH] reading it.
R:  Right.
L:  And two, if you don't really want to go there, you know, they're not, you know, making you have to read through this long drawn out intimate -- 
R:  [MN]
L:  -- paragraph as to what in the world's going on --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- and you're going, "Okay, I can skip this here".  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  So -- and I liked her but, um, most of the time I just pick books that just -- something like the book that I just finished was called Everything's Sacred and it was, uh, about a woman who, um, [MN] was just trying to show how she was learning to, um, find beauty and wonder- wonderful miracles [MN] everyday.
L:  Mm, wow.
R:  And, um, so it was kind of cool.  She -- I don't know if she was a Christian.  She -- she, um, quoted a lot from, um, Buddhist monks that she knew but she said she wasn't Buddhist.  So ...  [LAUGH]  She never came out and said what she [LAUGH] was.  But, um, that's okay because it -- it kind of encouraged me -- it -- because of where my relationship is with God it made me think of him.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  As the one that I should appreciate and -- and so since I read it I've actually found a few interesting things in my life that -- just around me that I never even noticed just by look-
