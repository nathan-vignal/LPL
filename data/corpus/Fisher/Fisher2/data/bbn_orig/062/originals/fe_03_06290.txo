L:  Yeah.
R:  And, uh, she was like, "Oh, I got it at a sample sale from Blase Blase.  She lives in Dumbo.  She'll have a sample sale on Saturday and this was just a random person.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, obviously -- I know she didn't pay no less than a buck fifty for that purse.

R:  Yeah.
L:  You could get like Prada for three dollars.
R:  No!

R:  So, where was that?
L:  Uh, I -- I don't know.  She said she was gonna let me know, you know, when it's gonna happen again.  But, um -- you know, 'cause I -- I don't live in Williamsburg.  So, I'm not familiar.

L:  But I -- I really feel bad for the old people though.
R:  I know.
L:  Like, I feel bad for the old people and the people who have been there forever --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause landlords are kicking like elderly out to rent to some like young schmuck that's willing to pay twice as much, you know?
R:  Yeah.  That's true.
L:  But it's like how can you push like an eighty year old woman out on the street?  It's not -- it's not cool, you know?

L:  She lives by herself, you know?
R:  Oh.

R:  So, make this my hobby.  So, I could be selling my stuff out -- out the door.
L:  I wanna like sell my paintings, you know?
R:  You paint.  Is it oil painting or, you know, canvas, what?
L:  Um, acrylic.
R:  Okay.
L:  Watercolor and acrylic.  I don't have as much patience with watercolor.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's like [MN].  It's -- it's -- but, um, oil is too smelly, you know, 'cause oil stinks, like it'll stink up the whole room.  I wanna get into ceramics too 'cause I used to do that as a little kid.
R:  Ceramics is hard.
L:  Yeah.  You know, paint like ...
R:  You can make me some plants.
L:  Yeah.  Paint some plates or something.  Actually there's another ad in the Village Voice.
R:  For what?

R:  You know what's better?  Craig's List.
L:  Huh?
R:  Craig's List.  Have you ever -- you're on that?
L:  Craig's List?  Does that ...?
R:  You've never been there?
L:  No.
R:  [MN]

L:  Oh, I -- what is it?
R:  It's a community board.  Everything is free posting.  So, you find jobs, gigs, people, everything.

R:  And they have one in every major city.  So, when you go to that --
L:  Yeah.

L:  I found something else too.  Musicians' bulletin boards, something like that.
R:  Yes.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  But that site is everything.  You wanna sell anything, you wanna find -- find a roommate, you wanna get a job.
L:  Yeah, we're thinking of selling my shit on eBay, you know?
R:  Oh, sell it on Craig's List it's free.
L:  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.
R:  Everything's free on there.
L:  Yeah.  So ...
R:  So, what ...?
L:  Basically all I do is hobbies.  I'm unemployed right now.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm employed -- I'm unemployed too 'cause I quit my job and I wanted to -- to seek my hobby.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I don't know what I'm doing right now.  But I think it's 'cause I turned twenty five and I'm just like going through it --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I'm like where am I supposed to be?  Where is my new car?
L:  Wait -- wait until you turn twenty seven.
R:  Oh, no, I can't think of that.
L:  It's like wow, you know, it's like ...
R:  You're there to thirty and then what?
L:  I'm turning twenty eight soon.  So, it's like I'm like I wanna find my destiny, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Where's my place in this universe?  You know, a lotta people commit suicide at twenty eight actually.
R:  Oh, go- ...
L:  Bummer.
R:  And are you -- are you engaged or anything?
L:  No.
R:  Okay.  So, I don't -- all right.  See, my friend came up to me on my twenty fifth birthday and told me ...
L:  I've got an ex boyfriend that wants to marry me, but I -- I can't deal with it, not now.  Not until like I'm successful with my music.
R:  Do you roomie?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you roomie?
L:  Do I have a roommate?
R:  Yeah.
L:  No, I live by myself.
R:  I just started roommating after all these years.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's really weird.
L:  It's -- it's less lonely.
R:  Huh?
L:  It's less lonely.
R:  It is less lonely, but not really 'cause my roommate's never here.
L:  Oh, she's never there?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's ...
L:  I mean, I -- I don't know.  My place is too small to get -- bring in somebody else.  I mean, if the person doesn't require much I don't care, you know, just go ahead.  But, I mean, it's kinda like a crappy situation.
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah.  It's cheap though.
R:  And [inaudible] right now to be following hobbies.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, I can practice music whenever I want.  I don't have to deal with somebody else, you know?  I can go to sleep whenever I want.
R:  So, who taught you how to play guitar, one of your hobbies?
L:  I'm actually teaching myself how to play the guitar.
R:  Like Michelle Brandt.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I love her.
L:  Really?
R:  Yes, I ...
L:  She's performing soon actually.  So, now we're talking about other people but, hey, who cares?  We get paid for this.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  So, you've done this how many times already?
L:  Only once.  It was terrible.
R:  Where did you see the ad?
L:  It was terrible.  I -- I --
R:  Right.
L:  -- I got this woman from Arizona --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I -- I knew she was white right away 'cause we were talking about affirmative action --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and she was like, "Oh, you know, there's no reason for it.  Black people are pretty much equal now" and I was like, "Well --
R:  And what does that mean?
L:  "-- I think if you're getting into college, if you're smart you'll get in", you know?  Like right now Bush is changing affirmative action so that the top -- whatever -- five percent, ten percent from each school gets to go to Ivy League or, you know, a college of their choice, you know?  That's great.  That's great.
R:  Yeah, that is.
L:  You know?  'Cause, you know, people even in the low income areas are going to get the chance.
R:  When we're at school we were sending out postcards to, um -- I don't know if it was the Senator or the Governor --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- they were trying to pass a law where there would be no financial aid for college --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- and what there would be is -- no, listen -- what there would be is no financial aid, but you have to take out student loans now if you graduate.
L:  You already take student loans though.
R:  Yeah.  But listen, if you graduate you're four years after taking the loans, all your loans are erased.  That's your financial aid.
L:  Why?
R:  Only if you complete school.  'Cause a lotta people take the financial aid and, you know -- and take it for granted.  So, they get their school paid and people that are really trying to go to school pay for their school and for that just take it out on a student loan.
L:  I got financial aid because I was poor.
R:  I got -- I didn't get financial aid --
L:  No?
R:  -- and I was poor.  I was very poor and I didn't get financial aid.  I was outta state.  They still didn't care.
L:  Do your -- do your parents have a high income or something?
R:  I don't include my parents.  I've been independent since seventeen.
L:  Oh.  'Cause I've -- I've heard that -- like my parents, you know, they don't make much, you know?  So ...
R:  I -- I didn't even put down my parents because I don't live with them.  All my W. two's and stuff.
L:  Wow!  That's kinda cool.  You've been on your own since you were seventeen.
R:  Yeah.  It's ...
L:  It's must've been rough.
R:  Well, uh, I'm glad that I always had a head on my shoulders and I always kept a job 'cause I always --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- wanted to show my mother I didn't them, you know?
L:  'Cause I got into trouble with drugs.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh, I smoke, but that's all right.
L:  You know?  It's like, "Oh, God!  Can I bomb at your house?  I just got kicked out".  But now I'm like clean, I'm sober, I don't do anything, I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't do drugs anymore, you know?  Like I'm totally straight now.  Occasionally I'll have a drink.
R:  That's good.  You have to have a healthy body.
L:  No, it's -- it was because it caught up with me.  It caught up with me really bad.  Like I got really sick and my throat --
