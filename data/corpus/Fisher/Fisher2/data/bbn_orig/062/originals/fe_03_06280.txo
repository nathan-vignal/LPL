L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  I'm Barbara.
R:  I'm Linda.
L:  Uh, it sounds like an interesting topic.  I have a lotta hobbies.
R:  Do ya?  [LAUGH]
L:  Do you have hobbies?
R:  Not a whole lot.
L:  Do you have a young family or ...?
R:  Um, yes.
L:  And that fills your time.
R:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, I'm seventy five years old --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- so I have free time.
R:  I'm forty three and I got three young children --
L:  What ages are ...?
R:  -- and I'm single.
L:  What ages are they?
R:  Um, fourteen, thirteen -- or fifteen, thirteen and nine.
L:  Oh, that's a hobby in itself.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What do you enjoy doing?
R:  Um, the Internet.
L:  Oh, I do.  I love that too.
R:  Do you really?
L:  Yes.  What kind of things do you do there?
R:  Actually eBay.
L:  Oh, you sell on eBay?
R:  Yep.  That's what I'm doing now is I'm checking my auctions.  I do that to make some extra money.
L:  Well, I enjoy refunding on the Internet.
R:  You what?
L:  Refunding, uh, looking for free after rebate things.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  That sort of thing.  I ...
R:  I do too.  The couponing?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm big in couponing.
L:  Oh, you are?
R:  I need to be as a single Mom.
L:  Well, that's a hobby.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Actually I'm writing a book on it.
L:  Really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Writing is certainly a hobby.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Is this your first book?
R:  Yeah.  See all my friends, you know, keep telling me I need to write a book because I keep getting -- giving them -- telling them how to do the grocery shopping, you know, to save money 'cause I spend very little --
L:  That's ...
R:  -- and I'm always giving them coupons for free things --
L:  That's interesting.
R:  -- you know, for free M. and M.'s, I mean, free Twix, c- -- you know, free candy, um, you know, free things and everything.  I keep telling them how to get the coupons.
L:  Do you take any of the, uh, refunding magazines?
R:  No.  Uh-uh.
L:  Well, you would really enjoy them I think.  I take Refund Express and Refunding Makes Sense.
R:  Oh, I haven't even heard of those.
L:  Well, they're both, um, I think the two largest refunding magazines.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  Both of them have big we- websites on the Internet too.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  You would enjoy them.
R:  Well, good.  Refunding Express?
L:  Uh, Refunding Express and Refunding Makes Sense.
R:  Oh, huh.  I'll check it out.
L:  You'll have to try them.
R:  Do what?
L:  You'll have to try them.
R:  Yeah.
L:  You'll have -- you'll have to, uh, log on to them.
R:  Yeah.  That's good.
L:  Give them a look.
R:  You -- do you do couponing?
L:  Yes, I do quite a bit of couponing.
R:  Oh, yeah --
L:  Not ...
R:  -- there's sites out there.
L:  Not as much as I used to do when my child was young --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and my husband was alive, but I still do quite a bit of it.
R:  Yeah, there's so much sites out there.  I mean, every day I get things in the mail for free.
L:  Yes.
R:  You know?  I don't know.  I get all kinds of samples and stuff and coupons and everything and my favorite is Deal Catcher dot com.
L:  Is -- I -- I didn't understand you.
R:  My favorite one is Deal Catcher dot com.
L:  Yes.  I've been there.  Yeah.
R:  Do you?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I do Fat Wallet too.
R:  Yeah, Fat Wallet.
L:  Uh, you find a lot of interesting things there.
R:  And then Ideal, Ideal.
L:  Yeah.  Fishing for Deal.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I see, yeah, you're really into it.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So -- and you said you didn't -- weren't big on hobbies.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I think that's one of the big ...
R:  I really don't consider that a hobby.
L:  You don't?  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You consider that making money and living, huh?
R:  Yeah, it really is saving money.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, there's nothing in the world like saving money.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I was a child of the Depression and I worked at that all my life.
R:  Mm.
L:  I can remember when, uh, we just had nothing because of the Depression --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and I don't know, sometimes I look at how economic things are now and wonder if we're going back there.
R:  Hm.
L:  Hope not.
R:  I hope not either.  Of course, you know, I haven't lived through that, you know, but I've heard about it, read about it.
L:  Yes, I think everybody's familiar with how miserable it was.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, you have -- your children are at a very interesting age.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I think you said the youngest one was nine?
R:  Yep.
L:  And the other's a teenager?
R:  Right.  Yep.  [LAUGH]
L:  The age when they're getting ready to leave you.
R:  Mhm.  My older one -- my oldest one is finally old enough to watch my youngest one.  So, I don't need babysitters anymore.
L:  That's a big money saver too, isn't it?
R:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Does she enjoy doing it?
R:  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That figures.  I have a grandson that, uh, will be fifteen --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- this summer and, uh, he's been working for a nursery and I think, uh, he made enough and he got an income tax refund of one whole dollar this year.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, my, um, oldest son who's thirteen got a paper route.
L:  And so he's making money.
R:  Yes, he's making money.
L:  What's he saving for?
R:  I don't know.  Just saving.  Well, he's drive- -- gonna be driving in three years.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, that's a big thing to save for.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  When he finds out what insurance is gonna cost it's gonna --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- be discouraging.  I remember when my son was that age, uh, just starting to drive, insurance was horrific and I know it's much, much worse now.  The thought of my grandson driving sort of frightens me.
R:  Yeah, my daughter wants to get some type of job this summer.
L:  What -- what sort of thing is she looking for?
R:  Well, she has to get a work permit.  You know, not many places around here hire fifteen year olds.
L:  Yes.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So -- and, you know, if I'm gonna work this summer I can't be driving her.  So, some places she has to walk to.  And my son's gonna be going to camp.  So ...
L:  Uh, what kind of work do you do?
R:  Actually I go to school pretty much fulltime [LIPSMACK], um ...
L:  What are you studying?
R:  Huh?
L:  What are you studying?
R:  Criminal justice.
L:  Well, that's a very popular field now.
R:  Mhm.  And then, um, um, I just do odd jobs.  Actually I do, um, mystery shopping.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, that sounds in- -- I have read about that.  I haven't tried it.
R:  Oh, I do that and I do demos in the stores.
L:  You pass out those nice samples?  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.  And then, um, I just had an interview today for an eBay job.
L:  An eBay job.
R:  Mhm.  A -- a company here in town has an eBay department and so I went for an interview today --
L:  I bet ...
R:  -- for a job in their eBay department.
L:  Now, that's something I've never heard of.
R:  Oh, that's what I wanna do 'cause I -- I, um -- I worked for a company a couple of years ago for a couple of years and, um, selling their stuff on eBay.  That's how I really got into it.
L:  That sounds ...
R:  Except now I just it on my own.
L:  That does sound like an interesting thing to do.
R:  Mhm.  This is for a non profit organization too.  So, it's helping people.
L:  And that will fit right in with your selling on eBay too, won't it?
R:  Mhm.  They're very interested.  So, I have to go through one more interview with somebody else.  So ...
L:  Well, I hope you get it.
R:  I do too.  It's part time, which I only want that for the summer, and I have another interview tomorrow for another company, which is also part time.
L:  And you -- if you're going to school you really need part time work, don't you?
R:  Mhm.  Yep.
L:  [LIPSMACK] How far along are you with your, uh, ed- education in criminal justice?
R:  I pretty much just started criminal justice, but I have all my, um -- I have all my, um, gen. ed's, my general education all done 'cause I'm really close to my degree in, um, computers.
L:  I taught secondary school for several years.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I know a lot about going to school.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And going to school in the summer time, which always seemed to be difficult because I did a lot of mine before there was a lot of air conditioning --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- and summer school was miserable.  You don't have that problem.
R:  I don't wanna -- I don't wanna go to school in the summer time.
L:  Do you enjoy the demonstrations in the stores?
R:  I love 'em.
L:  It's ...
R:  Actually I'm doing one on Saturday with Brita, um -- for Brita --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- and, um, uh, energy bars.  [LAUGH]  I get to keep the stuff I'm demonstrating.
L:  If you're like I am it'll be hard to keep from leaving the energy bar.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Ac- actually I -- you have little tiny samples.  So, I've been eating 'em and my kids have eaten some of 'em too.  [LAUGH]
L:  I love energy bars.  I think they're very tasty.
R:  Mhm.
L:  What kind will you be demonstrating?
R:  Um, from eleven to five.
L:  What kind of bar?
