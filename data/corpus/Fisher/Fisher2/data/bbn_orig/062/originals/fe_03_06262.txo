R:  Um, well, I'm from Brooklyn Heights --
L:  Oh, okay.

L:  Oh.  Yeah.  I used to -- I used to work in Brooklyn Family Court right down there.
R:  Oh, so you know the area real well.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Wow!  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  It's quite a small world, right?
R:  It is.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's funny too you worked in the court.  I'm a law librarian.
L:  Oh, that's so funny.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I was -- I was a social worker.  So, I was doing supervised visitations.
R:  Uh-huh.  Wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  Boy, you must've had your hands full there?
L:  Oh, yeah.  [LAUGH]  I did.  
R:  [LAUGH] Do you still do that?
L:  Huh?
R:  Do you still do that?
L:  No.  Now I'm working with, um, early intervention.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  For babies, you know, who have developed mental delays, um --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- birth to -- birth to three.  So, I help the families to, um, you know, get the children the help and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- do the evaluations and all that kinda stuff.
R:  That's really interesting.
L:  Yeah.  I like it.
R:  So, what do you do for a hobby then?
L:  Okay, for hobbies.  Well, uh --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- what do I do?  I sell stationery.
R:  Something to do to relax.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Besides running after my three kids I, uh -- I sell stationery --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- which is like -- it's a little business that I have, which I -- I really like to do and -- and I'm calling it a hobby 'cause I'm not making any money yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Well, the first few years of a business doesn't make money anyway.
L:  Right.  Right.  It's my -- my second year.  So, um, what else?  I -- I crochet.  I like to do that and I'm in the middle of making a blanket for my daughter.  It's been only like a year that I've been working on it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I -- I do like to read except, uh, it takes me like a year to read a book because I don't have much time and when I do sit down to read I fall asleep.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That sounds like me.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- I love to read, but it's like I get through two pages and I've like finally stopped moving and I fall asleep, you know?
R:  Well, that's why I stopped reading fiction because there's just no way -- I fall asleep too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  I mean, after a while, you know -- it'd be nice to have a whole day to read a book but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Oh, God!  Yeah.
R:  I -- I won't see that until I retire.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  So, I ended up just doing nonfiction, like cookbooks and things like that.
L:  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.
R:  So, um -- so as -- as far as crocheting well, see, that's funny 'cause I love doing that too.  I'm involved in, um, a project for, um -- it's called Ships Project.  I don't know if you've heard of it.
L:  No.
R:  It's -- it's had write ups, you know, and that's how I found out about it.  Um, they make hats and like, um -- they have like slipper socks --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- for the troops that are --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- on the ships because it seems that the, uh, computers on the ships have to be kept real cold and --
L:  Ah, so it's very air conditioned?
R:  -- they work in there all day so they're cold --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- and even, you know, nearby on the ship it's cold, you know, where they sleep.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  And the water.
R:  So, they make them hats and little booties.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well, that's nice.
R:  And then with ground forces they make these things called cool ties and they are just long strips that are made into a tube and then they put this special absorbent material that they can soak in water and it absorbs the cold water and they put it around their neck to keep cool.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  And it's -- it's really nice.  I mean, you know, you -- you go at your own speed --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- but they -- they keep you updated through email as far as ...
L:  Oh, what, do they send you like a pattern or something?
R:  Well, there's patterns online.  They have a whole website that, you know --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- things that the military will allow you to -- to make for them --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- you know, and what colors and all that stuff and what you get -- what's really nice is that, uh, once you're in the email list --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they send -- they pass on the thank you notes from the kids --
L:  Oh, that's so nice.
R:  -- and it's just so nice, it really is, and that's ...
L:  What's the website?
R:  Um -- oh, gosh, I don't know it offhand.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's called Ships Project.  I'm sure if you go in Goggle or something, you know, and just go in that --
L:  Ships Project.  Okay.
R:  -- you know?
L:  Ah, great.  That's great.  I'm gonna look into that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, it's -- it's really nice and you can go at your own speed --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they have these people, um, they're called P.O.C.'s, which are point of contact --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, there's like one person on the ship that accepts the boxes and ...
L:  So, you have a person to mail it to, right?
R:  Right.
L:  Oh, okay.  [NOISE]
R:  And, uh, that person -- what they do -- there's another woman who does this alone, um, you -- you make squares --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- which is great for me 'cause I like short projects.  So, you make squares and then send it to this lady and she makes afghans for those people.
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  You know?
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I -- I like to make the squares and I never get around to sewing them together.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Right.  That's what happens to me.  I think it's such a good idea because somebody who's gonna do it.  They're just looking for blocks, um -- the men don't like granny squares --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and we started out with that.  Now they just want solid blocks of knitting and crochet --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and, you know, they're seven inches square --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and you just send it off to the -- the contact woman who puts it all together and makes an afghan and then sends it to the P.O.C. of the ship.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  And, you know, they send thank you emails and, I mean, it's just so nice to read that these kids really appreciate it, you know?
L:  Right.  Yeah, that's nice.
R:  So, they give patterns -- you know, there's halves that you can sew that they make up of like, uh, a -- a thin fleece or you can knit or crochet, you know?
L:  Mm.
R:  There's all different patterns.
L:  Wow!
R:  And she gives all the -- you know, all the requirements --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- so that you don't do like -- like, make pink hats, you know --
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like some people were trying to.  They're scraps, you know, get rid of it.  [LAUGH]  But, you know, they'll -- they'll tell ya the colors and the sizes, what it should stretch out to and all that stuff.
L:  Oh, wow, that's great.
R:  So, it's -- it's a real nice project and it's -- it's a way to support the troops even if you don't support the war, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  Exactly.
R:  And -- and that's great, you know?  I mean, the kids need to know that there's somebody thinking about them --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- no mater what they're doing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Wow!
R:  But it's called Ships Project and I think it's run by a lady named Ellen, she's in Florida.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  And how I found out -- found out is I'm, um -- I'm on their list in Mine Brand Yarn and, um, they did a little like write up on their website about her --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and they had the link there --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- where you could join up.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, so far they've sent fifty two thousand boxes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, my God!  Wow!  That's amazing.
R:  So, this poor woman I'm telling ya.  They just started to limit when you could send because she -- her house is just full of boxes --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and she couldn't pack fast enough.
L:  Wow!
R:  But she also accepts donations for shipping because --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, she just pays that out of her pocket.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause it gets -- it gets expensive.  Yeah.  That's gets like expensive.
R:  Yeah.  God forbid, you know, the -- the post office would give her a break.
L:  Would just mail them for nothing, right?  Yeah.
R:  Oh, you couldn't, uh-uh.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  But it's -- it's a great project and a nice thing to do.  So ...
L:  Yeah.  That's really nice.
R:  And it's great for me 'cause it's short and sweet, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Just like a hat you can knock off in a couple of days --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, when you -- when you have a few hours here and there, you know?
L:  Right.
R:  But with three kids I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, mine's twenty one and -- and she finally flew the coop.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, you have -- you had the one?
R:  Yeah, I just have the one.
L:  Ah.
R:  My husband watched that one be born and he that's it.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Couldn't take it anymore, huh?
R:  No more after this.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, no.  Yeah, mine are t- -- gonna be ten, gonna be eight and gonna be four.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Their birthdays are in June and July.  So ...
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, now, when do you have time for a hobby?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, God!  I know.  I know.  Well, just go- going to work is like relaxing to me.  [LAUGH]
R:  I can imagine.  Wow!  And -- but who watches the kids?
L:  Well, like my two older ones are in school --
R:  Oh, that's right.  Mhm.
L:  -- and then my younger one goes to a day care, um, right near where I work --
R:  Oh, so that's convenient.
L:  -- and my boys actually went there -- I have two -- two boys and then a girl, and my boys actually went to the same day care.  So, it's like I just drop her off and forget about her, you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause it's -- you know, it's such -- such a great place.  I'm very comfortable and, you know?
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  So, I'm great friends with the lady who runs it and everything else.  So, I don't worry about it at all.
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And at least you get out of the house.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And -- and you know what?  It keeps her busy too because she's around all her friends and, you know --
R:  Well, yeah, you know --
L:  -- busy at all the time.
R:  -- and she's -- she's developing all those social skills --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that they need.
L:  It's great, yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Well, that's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I still don't see how you have time.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Well, I'm very -- I go to bed at like twelve o'clock each night, you know?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  It's like ...
R:  I'd say, "Oh, God, please let me go to sleep quick so I have more sleep".  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
R:  And let the kids sleep through too.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh.
R:  Oh.
L:  So ...
R:  But, um, what else ...?
L:  How did ya -- how did ya find out about this -- the -- the survey that we're doing now?
