L:  Oh, you like to online shop as well?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, do you -- do you go to the places where, um, like you can buy specialty things or just anything like clothes?
R:  Uh, um, at this stage, uh, because I start to -- I start to, um -- I've found some good websites who can recommend some good deals.
L:  Oh, great.
R:  So, uh, I start to purchase according to this guidance instead of just the shopping from special website like Amazon or something like that.

R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I tend to -- I find -- I like to go shopping, um, online for videos --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, that I -- usually used videos, maybe for my son for Christmas.
R:  Oh.
L:  And they, um, will go all over the United States and look at, um, video stores to find them for me if I can't find them in my hometown.
R:  Oh, that sounds good.
L:  And then I get 'em -- some of them for three and four dollars because they're older videos.
R:  Oh.  So, how older?  So, it's, uh, not -- you mean the age is older, something like that?
L:  Right.  He -- my son is nine --

L:  What type of fishing do you like to do?
R:  Uh, I -- I -- I usually just -- just use, uh, a normal -- the [inaudible].
L:  The bobbers?
R:  Yeah, the bobbers.
L:  Yeah.  I like to do -- I like to do that with my Dad.  I've always done that with my Dad since I've been little 'cause I can't -- I can't fish when there's no bobber.  I -- I can't understand it.
R:  Oh, okay.  And you know there are -- there are some good, um, ponds[?] around here.  So, we have a lotta places to go.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Uh-huh.  And, you know, that now the time is great for fishing because it's not too, uh -- too hot, it's not too cold.
L:  Right.  Right.  And the mosquitoes aren't out yet.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Yeah.  That's -- you're a pro, you know.  I still remember last -- last summer when I went out for fishing, uh, I -- I was -- I was bothered by the lot of -- by lots of mosquitoes.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah, that bothers me as well.

R:  Oh, no, I, um -- I -- I don't like baseball, you know?
L:  Yeah, I don't either.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, that's great.  I was too shy to tell ya that I don't like baseball.  When I get to know that you don't like it I feel so happy.
L:  Now, I also like to -- I like to cool as a hobby and learn a lotta new cooking.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, me too.
L:  Really?
R:  Me too.
L:  I like to learn other culture's cooking.
R:  Oh, me too.  [MN]
L:  My husband's from Mexico and I try and learn as much as I can about authentic Mexican cooking.
R:  Oh, that's great.  You know, uh, I think you probably know that I'm -- I'm from China.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, I can cook a lotta Chinese food, but ...
L:  And I can cook no Chinese food [LAUGH] and I would love to learn how to cook Chinese food, real Chinese food.
R:  Oh, really?

L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  I start to learn how to bake.  Bake ...
L:  Now, how -- where do you get your recipes?
R:  Mm, mm, I -- I learn some recipes from the Internet.
L:  That's what I do.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, do you?
L:  I can't -- I don't go out and buy books.  I just get on the Internet.  I go to all recipes dot com.  That's a good, um, website.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I do visit that website also.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  That's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And I also just, uh -- just copy my friends' recipes.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  When I visit, uh -- when I visit someone, uh, I just -- when I see something delicious --
L:  Right.
R:  -- I -- I will copy their rec- recipe.  You know?  I'd like to try some new -- new things.
L:  Right.  Well, what I like to do is when I go to a party --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and I like -- and I bring something to eat --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I, um, bring the recipe with me, I copy it, so that if anybody says, "Oh, I like that.  What's the recipe?"  I can give it to them.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  Okay.
L:  And then for --
R:  You're prepared for everything for your friends.
L:  -- for my sister in law, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- for her shower -- I had a shower for her --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I sent the invitations out and I asked everybody to bring their favorite recipe --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- since she was going to be newly married and then I had -- my Mom bought her a really pretty, um -- oh, what's the name of those? --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, recipe box and -- and so everybody brought their recipes on a recipe card [NOISE] and we all gave that to her as one of her gifts and then they put that in the recipe box that she got.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, that was neat.  So, everybody had different types of recipes.
R:  That's a good idea.
L:  You know?
R:  You know, I -- I feel really excited when -- when I do something good, make something good --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- and -- and they appreciate you, they like it.
L:  Exactly.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You can see it in their face.
R:  Yeah.  This is [MN] the time when I feel very, uh, satisfied.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Self satisfied.
L:  Oh, yeah, definitely.
R:  Right.  Uh, you know, this [MN] -- especially -- this is the first time that I try something --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and they like it.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, 'cause it can be hard.  Sometimes my stuff doesn't look like the recipe, but it tastes good.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  It doesn't look like the picture, but it tastes really good.
R:  Uh-huh.  I can understand.  Sometimes it seems like that, although it doesn't look good, look exactly what you want --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but it tastes good --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and people like it.
L:  Right.  [LAUGH]  Now, how long have you lived in Ohio?
R:  About two years.
L:  Oh, really?  Now, did you live in China before that?
R:  Yes, I did.
L:  Oh, wow!  Well, you speak very good English.
R:  Oh, thank you so much.
L:  [LAUGH] My husband's from Mexico and he didn't speak any English when I met him --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and -- and I didn't speak any Spanish --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and that was, uh, twelve years ago and he speaks very good English now.
R:  [LAUGH] Oh.
L:  But it's a hard language to learn.  English is a very hard language to learn.
R:  No, no.  I think English is a -- a simple language to learn.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  My husband said he thought it was hard.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I thought -- is Chinese hard to learn?  Have people said that?
R:  Uh, I -- I think so.  It's pretty hard and, uh, you know, I'm -- I'm not, uh -- I -- I don't like the language --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, I feel -- I -- I cannot understand some people who will, um, take learning language as a hobby.
L:  Oh, right.  [LAUGH]
R:  I -- I feel so confused, you know, sometimes?
L:  Yeah.  Well, I think the best way to learn it is to be immersed in it.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Like when I met my husband he didn't speak English and I feel in love with him.
R:  [MN]
L:  So, I had to learn the language 'cause I didn't speak Spanish --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and so we just started helping each other learn the language and now I speak a whole another language and I'm fluent in Spanish and so are my children.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now, I wouldn't want to go to s- -- I hated it in school and I would not wanna go to school to learn a language --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but it's been very neat.  We go to Mexico every year and it's been neat -- that's another hobby of mine is traveling.  I like to travel.
R:  Oh, yeah, I do.  I do.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I, um -- you know, um, in the last two years I have been to many places in America.
L:  Oh, really?

L:  Those are the places to see too.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Now, how do you -- how do you travel?  Do you -- do you usually travel by plane or drive?

R:  Of course because --
L:  You have to go to Disney World.

R:  Yeah, COSI.  Oh, I'm sorry.
L:  Oh, yeah, COSI is really fun.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  That's -- that's -- and they've redone it.  It was, um, in a different place when I was a child and now -- I'd say maybe about five years ago, um, they, um, rebuilt it in a different part of Columbus and put new things there and it's really, really a neat place for kids and adults to go.
R:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So, I -- I visited COSI and I was impressed.
L:  Oh, that's a neat place to go.  That's neat to know that you came from China and --
