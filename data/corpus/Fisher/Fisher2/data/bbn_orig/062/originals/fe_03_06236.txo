L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.
L:  I'm Vicky.
R:  I'm Carla.
L:  Hi.
R:  Hi.  Um, right now I'm in a exercise class.  It's my first one and I told 'em I can't do much 'cause I have a bad knee, so they think I'm run off to do some business.  My most enjoyable hobbies, I guess, are reading and sewing.
L:  Okay.  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  I like both of those.  Um, I also do a little collecting of a glassware.  It's kind of a hobby to go find it.  It's --
R:  It's what now?
L:  Glassware.  I collect a certain type of glassware.
R:  Oh.  What kind?
L:  Um, it's called vaseline glass.  Um, you -- it's -- it's a green in color and if you saw -- if you, um, shine a black light on it at -- at -- you know, when it's dark, if you shine this black light on it, it kind of glows in the dark.
R:  Oh, okay.  [MN]
L:  It's kind of hard to find so ...
R:  No, but it's a good way -- it's a good way to go shopping without spending money because it's so hard to find.
L:  Well, yeah, but --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- now I know the places to go, um ... [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [MN]
L:  It's kind of unique so I've --
R:  Yeah.  
L:  -- been collecting a little bit of that, so I consider that a hobby 'cause ...
R:  Yeah.  
L:  You know.
R:  Oh, yeah.  I collect -- I -- I collect green glass also but I collect the old Frigidaire[?] glass.  It's [MN] --
L:  It's that like the de- depression.  Is that what you would call it?
R:  Yeah.  It's -- it's before that but it's made from Frigidaire.  Like in +refrigerators.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, and it -- there's only -- there's not that -- that much of it but, um ...
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I've seen that.  'Cause once in a while I think you'll see a piece of that and they'll --
R:  Yeah.
L:  They'll call it depression or else they'll either, um, say it may have a little bit of this vaseline stuff in it.  'Cause a little bit of the depression glass actually has the vaseline --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- in it.
R:  Oh, I'll have to look for that.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- I -- I have way too many hobbies actually.  My husband is a computer expert so we do a lot of computer things.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, you know, for hobbies and -- and I think my -- my number one favorite hobby, actually, is -- is volunteering.  I volunteer for the, uh, [SIGH] Cancer Relay for Life and the Boys and Girls Club and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- [SIGH] the police department.  I'm a police officer and, uh --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- I do [several inaudible words] and so I do a lot of volunteer for that, you know.  Speaking -- public speaking and stuff.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, raising a -- I'm a fundraiser.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Some people are scared to speak to me anymore.  So, you know, that's a nice one 'cause I don't spend any money doing that one.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  That's a nice one.  Well, yeah --
R:  The point[?] is --
L:  -- being a volunteer's great.
R:  [several inaudible words] for grandchildren is experience -- is expensive.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  
R:  So ...  
L:  Mm.
R:  Well, where do you -- where do you go to -- to do it?  You know, do you -- I mean do you take -- take a week and go places or is it ...?
L:  Oh, for the vaseline?  Now this, um, past week, um -- I'm in Ohio.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And in Springfield, Ohio, there's a huge antique, um, thing, like at the fairground.
R:  Right.
L:  And we go up there every year.  And hunt --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- it up there.  Like antique shops or -- mostly that's where you find.  Or we have a couple of dealers that sell it. But the thing is, is some companies don't make this anymore because it has --
R:  Right.
L:  -- uranium in it.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And -- yeah --
R:  And that's what makes it glow.
L:  Yeah.  And they're having a hard time with ocean, whatever -- 
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- dealing with the uranium so a lot of companies just kind a quit making it.  But to me that just makes it more rare.
R:  Yeah, I guess it would, so ...
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So.
L:  So ...  But -- and I like to sew too.  Cross stitch a little.  I just can't do it like I used to.  
R:  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm making a quilt for the Relay for Life and it -- 
L:  Oh, I would love to --
R:  -- its half way done --
L:  -- do that.
R:  -- and I'm three weeks away, so ... [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  
R:  So ...
L:  You're a procrastinator.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  Uh, hey, you know, maybe that's my number one hobby.  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [MN]  Are you in Ohio or ...?
R:  I'm in Georgia.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh.
R:  [MN]
L:  [MN]  Far away.  I just know I talked to a couple of people from, like, Indiana, I think before.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um, yeah, it's good to have several hobbies, I think.  I think --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- everybody needs one or two anyway.
R:  Well, I -- I think -- my sewing is a solitary hobby because the room is such a destructive mess when I'm done, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- 'cause I got stuff everywhere.  And then the computer's my husband and I.  And then antiquing, and all, I do with my daughter in law.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, and then, like, my granddaughter and I collect -- she's only three.  She doesn't know that she does this yet but --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  We put -- we collect patriotic things.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Um, you know, o- old flags that are, um, you know, baskets that have a -- a flag or theme on it or something like that.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So they're doing that and I [inaudible].
L:  Well, you should find a lot of that right now.
R:  Yes.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yes, I've bought two new books today.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  As opposed to old books but, uh, you know, I'm trying to [MN] and -- and I -- I have her collecting rocks.  
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Um, because you know how all children pick up rocks?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I said, "If you're gonna pick 'em up and bring 'em in the house you got to know what they are".
L:  Mhm.
R:  So we'll look up in the book and see what, you know, what -- what kind of rocks they're made of and we'll -- we all -- we take a lot of trips.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, even if we just go to the fair or we go to the Scottish festival, that's our -- the entire family hobby -- we take nine or ten people.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, go to the Scottish festivals and then we have to pick a rock up from that place.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And list it in our little book and things like that so ...
L:  Yeah.  Yeah, I know one of my friends was a geologist and I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- learned a little bit about rocks from her.  
R:  [MN]
L:  You know, we went and we liked to go down to Tennessee to different lakes and they had a, like a roundish, like, rock that she was all thrilled about.  Um ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Now I forget what she called it now.  I don't think it was a -- something with a -- +trilobite.  I don't think it was a round one.  But anyway she was just thrilled that -- I guess in this area and Tennessee area and stuff there's a lot.  A lot of geology [SIGH] --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- but ...  So ...  But yeah, I think everybody needs a hobby.  I think that was one of the questions. 
R:  Yeah.  I think it [SIGH] -- it keeps you sane.  It gives you a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- reason to, uh, to get out of the house.  
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  Or we just have, you -- you know.  Especially, I -- I -- we look at as we get older.
L:  Mhm.
R:  You know.  We're -- we're both in our fifties and, uh, and we say when we get older what are we gonna do when we're not --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- working anymore?
L:  Well, even now.  I mean, I garden just a little, you know, just around the sidewalks and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- even that takes a lot of time, and it's so nice to get outside.  
R:  Yes.
L:  And -- and do that. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...  And you're exercising now.  You can -- can even call that a hobby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, we bought bicycles last fall when it was -- when it -- when all the heat, 'cause it's so hot down here in Georgia.
L:  Mhm.
R:  When it turned cool -- when it turned a little cooler we bought bicycles.  Um, you know, so we -- we do that together --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- when he gets home from work at night.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brad liked to have a computer expert.  Seems like --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- mine is always acting up.  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, you know the story about the -- the cobbler's children going barefooted.  My husband fixes everybody except[?] his computer.
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mine has had a, you know, had -- needs -- needs updates on it that are two months old now.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I'd like to just wipe everything off a mine and start all over, I think.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, we're doing that this weekend to mine but, you --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- know, he promised me this weekend, so yeah.
L:  I would like to.  We have a little --
R:  But --
L:  -- grandbaby in the house and you can't get anything done.  But it's fun.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  How old is your grandchild?
L:  He's three months.
R:  Oh, yeah.  
L:  And they actually live with us for now 'cause they're both in school and stuff so, um, in college, you know, so ...
R:  Yeah, ours lived with us between jobs [inaudible].
L:  They, um, it's -- it's kind of neat.  
R:  It is.  It's fascinating, you know.  So ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  Well, I'm teaching -- E- Emily's, uh, just turned three and we just enrolled her in -- she has a speech impediment so we had to be -- wait a little while -- uh, dance class and --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- it's, um, it's a, um, African dance troupe that teaches it.  And they mix mod- -- uh, modern African dance with traditional ballet.
L:  Mm.
R:  And so these children really learn some fan- fantastic moves.  Grandma's too old to do it but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  But I can watch.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So -- so that's ...
L:  Oh, that sounds neat.
R:  So, you know ...  'Cause I -- I think even little children need to -- to have something that they can do and learn in.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Call it a hobby.
L:  Yeah, they do.
R:  Learn to play with other children and share and all that kind of good stuff.  It --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It helps 'em
L:  Yeah, they learn a lot of discipline with the dance --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- too.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [MN]  And it's not too dangerous.  My boys always came up with these dangerous hobbies like motorbike racing.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  My -- my -- my friend that I'm here with tonight, her son, uh, rides, what do you call those things?  Four wheelers.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And -- and he got a concussion over the weekend.
L:  Oh, my gosh.
R:  So ...
L:  Yeah, mine rides dirt bikes and I beg him to stop but he just won't.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  So ...
R:  Well, I'm fortunate.  My son never -- he -- you know, he's married now and knows that he can't afford one but he -- he never wanted a motorcycle or any of those kind of things so ...
L:  Mhm.
R:  And he never played the -- the violent sport --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- which pleased me.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  
R:  He played in a band and that was our hobby for a long time.  You know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  We were the band parents for [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, I -- I think children are probably your main hobby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH]  Yeah, it's nice --
L:  And grandchildren.
R:  -- after working at the police department all day and seeing the dirty side of life to go out and play with nice children.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [MN]
R:  So ...
L:  Well, it's great though that you volunteer and everything.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean ...
R:  Well, I keep saying it's a very small town and we just, you know, it's a -- it's a -- it's, um -- I have to -- I have to feel like I'm contributing some way besides making people unhappy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  
R:  [several inaudible words] make [MN] -- make, you know [several inaudible words].
L:  Yeah, that mean person that gives people tickets.  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
R:  No, I'm a detective.  I -- I -- I --
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  -- [inaudible] with the violent crimes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh.
R:  So ...  So it's --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- really, you know, after -- after a hard day like that it's nice to go out and play with somebody's children and --
L:  Definitely.  Definitely.
R:  [LAUGH]  Wander through the fabric stores and play --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with Winnie the Pooh pictures and stuff.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Mm.  [MN]
R:  Well, what are your husband's hobbies?
L:  Um, a fireman.  He's a volunteer fireman.  
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  And then he hunts.  Those are his two biggies.  So we -- I said, "Well, between all -- all the hunting and every-
