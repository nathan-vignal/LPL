L:  Hi, my name is Miriam.
R:  Hi, Miriam.  My name is Cindy.
L:  Hi, Cindy.  Can you hear me 'cause I'm on my headset phone?
R:  Yeah.  Can you hear me?
L:  Yes, I can.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  [LAUGH] Where -- where are you calling from?
R:  California.
L:  Oh, me too.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  So, it's nine o'clock your time, huh?
L:  Yes, exactly.  Where in California are you?
R:  In Los Angeles.
L:  Okay.  I'm in Santa Monica.
R:  Oh.  Oh.
L:  So, what are your hobbies?
R:  Mm, that's a hard one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I don't know.  Cleaning the house, taking care of the children.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Is that a hobby?
L:  I -- it is if you enjoy it.
R:  I mean, cooking, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  I guess.  What are your hobbies?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Well, that sounds good.  Um, probably working out in the form of, um, I like to do things by the beach.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Um, I like to go roller blading or jogging.
R:  Oh.
L:  So, I guess that's a hobby right now.
R:  Yeah.  Is it okay --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to ask you how old you are?
L:  Sure.  I'm thirty three.
R:  I just wondered.  You're still roller blading.  So, like, you know, I'm thinking that --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- you must be quite a bit younger than me.
L:  No.  [LAUGH]  I don't know about that.  I go really slow.
R:  I'm forty five.
L:  Okay.  Well, you're still young to roller blade.
R:  Yeah.  I don't think so.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The last time I tried that I fell and it wasn't a good thing.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  You've gotta -- I fell my first time out.  You've gotta go super, super slow and I don't go down any hills.
R:  Yeah.  I think it was in Santa Monica too --
L:  Oh, no.
R:  -- pursuing the hobby.  No.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Roller blading, no.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you think it's important for people to have hobbies?
L:  [LIPSMACK] I do.  I think it's important to pursue whatever it is your passion is and I think for a lotta people that might be their hobby.  Not everyone can pursue their passion in real life.
R:  Yeah, that's true.
L:  So ...
R:  A lotta people end up not doing what they wanna do.
L:  Yeah.  Do you also work or -- or do you get to be a housewife?
R:  Um, I -- I usually work, but right now I'm just at home.
L:  Okay.
R:  I've been unemployed for about six months.  So, I know it'd be time to pursue a hobby.  But I've been thinking after I get my house straightened up a little better, um, because ...
L:  It's gotta be a lotta work.  How many kids do you have?
R:  I have two still at home.
L:  Two s- -- oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow!
R:  They're teenagers.
L:  Oh, okay.  I know I have a hard time keeping my house clean and there's just me.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, oh.  Every day that's for sure.
L:  Yeah.  I bet.
R:  Well, I guess -- you know, we've gotta a couple of birds.  I guess that would be considered a hobby.
L:  [LIPSMACK] Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I love animals too.  What kind of birds do you have?
R:  We have a, um -- African Gray Parrot and a Parakeet.
L:  Wow!  What is an African Gray Parrot --
R:  Grey Parrot.
L:  -- look like?
R:  They're gray with a red tail.
L:  Really?
R:  But they have big beaks, the parrot beak.
L:  Oh.
R:  They sorta look ...
L:  They sound pretty.
R:  Yeah.  They sorta -- well, I won't say they look like a pigeon with the red tail --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but some people may describe them.
L:  Now, can you get them to talk at all?
R:  Yeah.  They have, um --
L:  Really?
R:  -- they have quite a high intelligence, like they have been rated between maybe a four and a five year old in intelligence.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But they have the temperament of a two year old.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, they're sort of honorary I guess is a good word sometimes.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But she's really sweet.
L:  Oh.
R:  I bought her for my husband for his birthday.
L:  Really?  Does he like your birds as much as you do?
R:  You know what?  He's always wanted one.
L:  Oh.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  So, this is -- this is --
L:  Well, that's sweet you got him the gift then.
R:  -- his chance to have one.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, of course, we have fish and a cat and a dog.
L:  Oh, you're lucky.
R:  Even though I don't consider them hobbies.  I would ...
L:  Well, I -- I might.
R:  Go ahead.  You think so?
L:  No, maybe going to the zoo's a hobby or ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Sounds like collecting animals might be a hobby for you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Probably just taking care of things.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I wish I could have a pet.  They won't allow them in my building unfortunately.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, maybe a bird though if they didn't know about it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.  I used to, um --
L:  But, uh ...
R:  -- live in Santa Monica.  So, I'm pretty familiar with it.
L:  Oh, you did?
R:  Sure.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  I was born in Santa Monica.
L:  You're kidding?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Well, that's interesting.  I don't think I've met anyone born in Santa Monica.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Wow!
R:  And my husband too.
L:  Is that right?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did you meet your husband here in Santa Monica?
R:  No.  I met -- met him in Chatsworth.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's interesting.  How did you guys meet?
R:  We met at church.
L:  Good for you.
R:  So, maybe church is sort of a hobby for us too.  I don't know.
L:  There you go.
R:  I guess a hobby is things -- just anything that you enjoy doing, right?
L:  That's right.  Absolutely.
R:  So, we enjoy doing that and we enjoy helping people.
L:  Right.  I like that too.
R:  Yeah.  So, do you work a lotta hours?
L:  [LIPSMACK] Um, kind of in between stuff right now.  So, I'm not really working a lotta hours at the moment.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], I'm kinda like you.  I'm -- well, I'm working with someone, but I'm unemployed at the moment.  So ...  [LAUGH]
R:  Are you?
L:  It's a quiet a time, yes.  It's sort of like hiatus right now.
R:  Yeah.  Oh --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is it a studio thing?
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh.
L:  I work in, uh, entertainment.  So, everything's on hiatus right now.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I've been off work for about six months.
L:  Okay.  It's kinda nice, isn't it?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, you know what, I worked fulltime for the past, uh, twenty five years.
L:  Did you really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  And while -- while raising a family?
R:  Yeah, and it's been --
L:  Oh, that must be hard.
R:  -- really, really hard.
L:  I bet.
R:  So, I figured that was my opportunity to stay home and have a hobby.  No.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  But ...
L:  Well, that will get you started and think of more hobbies.  So ...
R:  Well, yeah, and I told my husband -- I'm cleaning out a room and I told him, you know, I'd like to bring my sewing machine back in --
L:  That's a definite hobby.
R:  -- 'cause believe it or not I know how to sew.  So ...
L:  Well, good for you.  So, you sew?
R:  And then I took up crocheting again.
L:  Well, that sounds like a hobby right there.
R:  Yeah.  I guess I do do a few things, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Absolutely.
R:  So, what about you?  We've got roller blading ...
L:  Let me think.  I also -- I like to do graffiti artwork, um ...
R:  When I thought of graffiti I thought the kind on the buildings.
L:  Yeah.  It looks kinda like that, but --
R:  Mm.
L:  -- I do it more on, um, cards, kinda thing.
R:  Oh.
L:  I don't -- you won't see me out working out on a building, but ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I'm thinking of a way to put it on to maybe tee shirts --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- graffiti artwork.
R:  So, you're an ...?
L:  So, I guess we have more hobbies than we think we -- we do, right, 'cause we ...?
R:  Yeah.  So, you're an artistic person?
L:  Somewhat.  Mostly with letters though for some reason.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I like graffiti and, um, I'm a writer too.  So ...
R:  A runner?
L:  Yeah, a journalist.  So, that's probably tied in with that somehow.
R:  Now, what does that consist of?
L:  What's that?
R:  Did you say you're a runner?
L:  A writer.
R:  A writer?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, I see.
L:  Mhm.  [LIPSMACK]
R:  Yeah.  That's never really been my forte.
L:  So, did you watch American Idol tonight?
R:  Um, I went to turn it on and there was a commercial and I turned it off.
L:  Oh, I don't know, um ...
R:  Is that your show?
L:  No.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I watched it and, um, I thought I would, you know, figure out who I wanted to vote for, but they're both really good.  So, I'm not gonna vote.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and now I'm watching that new model show.  I don't -- I have this addiction.  Maybe that's a new hobby.  I have an addiction to reality T.V. programs now.  [LAUGH]
R:  Like what kind?
L:  Well ...
R:  You know, like Fear Factor?
L:  No, I don't like that one.  The Bachelor.
R:  That's really gross.
L:  Yeah, that's gross.  I don't like the ones that -- that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- make you queasy.  No.  But I like The Bachelor and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- those kinds.  But my girlfriends and I, um [LIPSMACK], I don't know, we just have this thing where we -- we probably need to get lives, that's what we need to do.  [LAUGH]  But in the meantime we're vicarious ...
R:  I've found myself watching more T.V. lately too.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  They must be somehow designing them so they suck you in more.
R:  Well, you know what?  The computer can be sort of a hobby.
L:  That's true.  Oh, I definitely am on the computer a lot.
R:  I -- yeah.  There you go.
L:  Mhm.  I love to search the Internet.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And what about your kids, do they have hobbies?
R:  No, that would be too easy.  They're bored teenagers.
L:  [LAUGH] Is that right?
R:  Yeah, fifteen and seventeen.
L:  What about ...?  'Cause I know my nieces are into cheerleading and soccer.
R:  You know, they have -- one of 'em did play really good in sports, which is a hobby, but then --
L:  Sure.
R:  -- again, uh, she changed schools and there's a rule that if you play -- she played like ball sports in the ninth grade --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and if you change schools you can't play ball sports for a year.
L:  That's odd.
R:  They do that so that schools don't recruit kids from other schools.
L:  Oh, is that right?
R:  Yeah.  You know, because they'll say come to our school and we'll pay for your education --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- if you play ball for us and so you know, the last year she hasn't been doing anything.  It's been horrible.
L:  I didn't realize they would -- they could do that even in high school.
R:  Yeah, it is for high school.
L:  Mm.  That's interesting.  I thought maybe that was just a college thing, but ...
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Mm.
R:  So, hopefully she'll get back involved in something --
L:  Right.  Well, maybe that was -- 
R:  -- besides how she looks.
L:  -- a good thing.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I know.  Teenagers are funny to me now that they -- they care so much about that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  It takes her three hours to get ready for school in the morning.
L:  [LAUGH] Does it really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Isn't that funny?
R:  She gets up at five thirty in the morning.
L:  To straighten her hair?
R:  To -- she washes her hair every morning and then the make up thing I can't even imagine how long that takes.
L:  And she's how old?
R:  Fifteen.
L:  Wow!  Well, nothing shocks me anymore.  My nieces that are about that age -- one has just turned sixteen -- they're into Burberry, the store Burberry, and Abercrombie and Fitch --
