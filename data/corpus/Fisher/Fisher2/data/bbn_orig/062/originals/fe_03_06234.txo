L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Colleen.  What is your name?
R:  My name is Gerry.
L:  Hi, Gerry.  Nice to meet you.  Where do you live?
R:  I live in Chicago.
L:  [MN]
R:  Where do you live?
L:  I live in New Jersey.
R:  Oh, boy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  What is the weather like in Chicago?
R:  Oh, it was like sixty today.  A little overcast but now th- the sun is out.  
L:  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, and it's probably still --
R:  How was your weather?
L:  It was nice today.  
R:  Oh.
L:  The first nice day we've had in a very long time.
R:  Oh, we've had some nice days so --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I [MN] shouldn't complain.
L:  Yeah.  We've had some pretty nasty weather.  So what kind of hobbies do you have?
R:  Well, my main hobby is refunding.
L:  [inaudible]
R:  With using --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- coupons and sending --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- in for rebates. 
L:  [MN]
R:  Are you +one [LAUGH] of us?
L:  No, but you know what?  I -- I used to be more involved in that than I am now because I'm so busy but, you know, I always like wa- -- have wanted to get more involved in it.  Because I really believe you can -- you know, you can almost pay yourself to do that.  
R:  Oh, I know.  In fact, um, oh, two weeks ago in the Sunday supplement.  The little coupon sections.  There was a coupon to get a free BIC [MN] razors of four of 'em.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Up to three ninety nine, and then there was a form to send in for the rebate to get your money back.  So you got free razors plus they're paying you to [COUGH] keep 'em.
L:  Isn't that funny?
R:  Mhm.
L:  I love that.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  I love that.  But I have to tell you.  It was one of my -- one of my best [MN] bargains that I found.  It wasn't a coupon thing, but it was a bargain thing that I found, was I needed a new coffee maker and I bought, um -- I happened to be at Staples to get some office supply stuff and I saw on their bargain table they had a Krupps coffee maker which was really nice, and they had it on a clearance for seven dollars and fifty cents.  And I thought, " [MN]  How can I go wrong?"  I brought it home and within weeks I broke the carafe.  So I went online to find out how much it would cost me to buy a new [LAUGH] carafe.  The new carafe was like twenty dollars.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, more than [LAUGH] the ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  I only spent seven fifty for the whole coffee maker.
R:  I know, that's like the Mr Coffee Machines when they first came out.  If they broke, it was cheaper to go out and buy a new one.  
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  Oh ...
L:  It was --
R:  That's too --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- bad that happened.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [COUGH]
L:  That's -- well, that's interesting.  I don't really have -- I mean, I [SIGH] -- you know, there are certain things.  I like to garden and I, you know, I like flowers.  Flower gardening.
R:  I do too.  I --
L:  I love that.  
R:  We live in a condo now but when we lived in the suburbs I always had a flower garden and a vegetable garden.
L:  Mm.
R:  I do miss that.  I --
L:  Yeah, my husband does the vegetable gardening mainly.  And I -- I just like to do flowers.  But I -- I think it's essential, it really helps me relax.  I just love it.
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.  I used to like to go out there and just dig in the dirt and plant things and watch 'em grow and change things around.  And they --
L:  Do you have a patio where you are?
R:  No.  No.
L:  Oh.
R:  I'm in downtown Chicago, right on the lake.
L:  Wow.
R:  And, uh, there is -- [MN] I'm on the fiftieth floor and --
L:  Oh, my [LAUGH] heavens.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I guess not.  Wow.
R:  It's a nice view.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  
R:  But we face the s- -- well, we see the harbor with all the boats in and some of the museums.  And there's a park on the third floor but they, of -- they, of course, do all the planting and flowers and trimming and maintenance so ...  That was one of the reasons why we sold our house.  
L:  Right.
R:  Kids all got married and we just didn't want a house any longer t- to have to take care of --
L:  It's a lot of work.
R:  It is.  [COUGH]
L:  It's a lot --
R:  But we --
L:  -- of work.
R:  We had had a big house and I had been sick so we just thought, "We don't need this".  
L:  Hm.
R:  So ...  It was a big change.  [LAUGH]  To move from the suburbs back into the heart of the city.  
L:  Now how long ago did you do that?
R:  About eleven years ago.
L:  Oh.  Now do your kids live near you?
R:  We're kind of in the middle.  One lives an hour away in one direction and one lives an hour away in the other direction.
L:  Well, that's not too bad.  
R:  Yeah.  Do you have any children?
L:  I have children.  Um, [LIPSMACK] I have one up in Albany, New York, and one in Maine and then I s- -- I have one still at home.
R:  Oh.
L:  Who's fifteen.
R:  Oh.  
L:  So ...
R:  And then I have another child in Hawaii.
L:  [MN]  
R:  They live there.
L:  That's nice.  
R:  He was a pilot in the navy and they -- he was assigned there and they liked it so much that they stayed on.
L:  Wow.
R:  And now he flies for Aloha Airlines.
L:  Oh, nice.
R:  Yeah.  
L:  That's nice.  Do you get out there to visit very often?
R:  We haven't yet.  We will.  We plan on going.
L:  Mm.  Well, that's a good hobby.  Travelling.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Do you travel?
R:  I'm not a very good travel person.  I get carsick, uh, motion sickness.
L:  Mm.
R:  So --
L:  Oh, that's awful.
R:  I mean, I dread going on trips.
L:  Yeah.  Have you got -- has that --
R:  Do you travel a lot?
L:  -- been all your life that you've been like that?
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  Oh.  
R:  You'd think I would outgrow it, but I don't.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I haven't.  
L:  Yeah.  I'm kind of that way too.  I'm kind of that way too.  I'm not -- and I'm not a very good traveller but, you know, I -- I'll do it to get [LAUGH] somewhere.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But, um, I don't necessary enjoy the travelling part of it.
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  Um ...
L:  That -- a lot of people do that for a hobby.  They really --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  -- enjoy that.  
R:  I know.  I know.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  Now did you and your husband both work before you retired or were you ...?
R:  Well, he retired at fifty five.  That was always his goal.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So -- and I had worked, but not a whole lot.  I was a nurse and I had, um, gotten rheumatoid arthritis so --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that kind of put me back.  I'm just recovering from a hip replacement.
L:  Oh, my goodness.  
R:  So ...  [MN]
L:  That's really hard, isn't it?
R:  Yeah, there -- it's easy compared to -- I had both of my knees replaced at the same time.  Plus I've had both elbows replaced.  So ...
L:  Oh, my goodness.
R:  So that kind of [LAUGH] limits some things.  By the time I get over one thing it's another thing bothering me, so ...
L:  That -- that's awful.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Yeah, but I'm lucky.  I've got my husband here and the family is very supportive, so ...
L:  Oh, boy.  
R:  Mm.
L:  I know, I just hate -- I -- I'm so -- I'm very wimpy when it comes to -- to having to be in the hos- -- I've only ever had to be there to have babies but I hated that.  I hated --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- being in the [LAUGH] hospital for that.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh.
L:  I can't even imagine having to go and have surgery and --
R:  Oh, I know.
L:  Oh, that would be --
R:  I know
L:  -- so hard.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's really hard.  
R:  But you're --
L:  Do you have grandchildren?
R:  I have five of them.
L:  Oh, you are so blessed.
R:  Mhm.  The oldest was just eight.
L:  Oh.  [several inaudible words].
R:  And the youngest is about seven months.  
L:  +Oh.
R:  So ...
L:  What a treasure.  They're a hobby.
R:  I do reading.  Um, I [MN] like to collect -- I have a collection of Lladros.
L:  Of wh- -- I'm sorry what?
R:  Lladro statues.
L:  Oh.
R:  I collect -- I have Precious Moments I collect.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, some Hummels.  I started out with collector plates and then I moved into the [MN] figurines.  
L:  Wow.
R:  So ...  That's kept me busy over the years.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Huh.
R:  Do you collect anything or -- 
L:  I -- you know what?
R:  -- you have other hobbies.  
L:  I -- uh, my grandmother -- when I was a litte girl, my grandmother had a collection of teacups and saucers.
R:  Oh.  Mhm.
L:  And so, um, when she passed away I was the one that inherited them.  I just love them 'cause --
R:  Oh.  
L:  -- when, um, she -- when I was a little girl we used to have little tea parties with them.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And she would let me pick which one I wanted and --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  There was a lot of memories so, yes --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- since -- since I've had them, I mean, I -- my grandmother passed away when I was twenty so ...  Since I've had them, um, I have collected other, you know, teacups and saucers and, interestingly enough, I've run into other people that collect them and I've [MN] often times I've taken maybe one -- you know, real special friends that move away or whatever, I've taken one of my grandmother's cups and saucers and given it to them as a gift.
R:  Oh.  
L:  And I've had people that have given me cups and saucers that they've had for years.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...
R:  Do you have 'em on display?
L:  Um, some of them.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  Not all of them.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  I -- you know, if I had something [inaudible] like enclosed in glass, I probably --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- would.  But I don't.  I -- 
R:  Mm.
L:  I just have them.  I have, like, an old Hoosier cabinet and it's got some shelves and I've got some of them out, but nowhere near all of the ones I have.  But they're a treasure.  And, you know, you can remember where -- when and where you were when you got each one and I -- I like that.  It's [MN] --
R:  I have a teapot and some cups from my one grandma.  And I -- I remember looking at 'em when I was little, and I always wished I would have 'em and I have 'em.
L:  That's sweet.
R:  Yeah, um ...
L:  That's really sweet.  I know, it makes you wonder what kind of things that, when you go, y- your kids or your grandchildren are gonna -- are gonna want, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- of yours.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, they say you should make a list and state who gets
