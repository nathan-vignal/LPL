L:  Hi.  This is Sophie.
R:  Hi.  This is Tammy.  How are you?
L:  Hi, Tammy.  How are you?
R:  Good.
L:  Good.
R:  Um, this is like my third call.  So, I'm used to these.  How 'bout you?
L:  Okay.  This is actually my first call.
R:  Okay.
L:  I've not very familiar with what -- what needs to be done.  So, um ...
R:  Okay.  Well, basically, you know, we [several inaudible words] -- I don't know if that makes a difference.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, but, um, you -- they just basically wanna know what our hobbies, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- how often we do it basically I suppose --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and whether we think everybody should have a hobby.
L:  [LAUGH] Okay.  [NOISE]
R:  And my opinion is yes, everybody should have some sorta hobby I guess.
L:  Definitely.
R:  But everybody's hobbies, you know, vary.  Mine do for instance.  My hobbies -- I hate to say this -- Internet.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I shouldn't say that because that's probably bad for you, you know what I mean --
L: Exactly.
R:  -- being on the Internet all the time.  But, I mean, I do have other hobbies.  I'm a camper.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  A gardener, um, stuff like that.  Um, when we camp -- we -- we do that as much as possible in the summer time.
L:  I got it.
R:  And gardening and outdoor activities.  We spend a lotta time outdoors doing our garden actually.
L:  I ...
R:  That's one of our favorite activities and hobbies.
L:  Okay.  Um, I myself I live in California.  We have, uh, mostly sunny weather here.  Uh, most of the time I spend -- if I get any time to myself I would rather be at the beach and, you know, get some sun.  But unfortunately with the work situation it's hardly, um, possible to have it.  Um, the second hobby that I have I -- I'm a pro tennis player and I do, uh, at least one to two hours of, um -- in a week play tennis.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yes.  Um, but as [COUGH] -- as you said, it all depends if -- if work permits and if you have any time to yourself.  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Exactly.
L:  Exactly.  I'm in the same situation as you.  Most of the time -- I spend most of my time unfortunately behind a computer doing work and stuff.  So, um, that's what it ...  How is the weather in Ohio?  I'm not very -- I've never been there.
R:  Iowa.  Excuse me.  It's Iowa.
L:  Iowa.  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  Um, we're kind of -- it's just going into spring.  So, it's -- feel like well, maybe sixties out there.  It's not quite warm.  I mean, it's warm but, you know, you still wanna wear jackets, you know?
L:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
R:  So, I wish it was warm all the time to be honest.
L:  [LAUGH] Interesting.
R:  Then my hobby would be outside swimming probably --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- in the ocean or something.
L:  I know.  Well, gardening is something that I always enjoy to do.  Um, I never had a chance.  We just recently bought out home.  That's something that I would like to do in the near future, to get involved with my gardens and stuff.
R:  So, you might make that now a -- a big hobby?
L:  I'd love ...  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'd love to, but I haven't had a chance.  But I know it's -- it's inside of me, something that every time I go to the gardening shop I enjoy seeing people doing it.
R:  Yes.
L:  So, that's something that I would like to pursue in the near future hope- -- um, you know, if I can.
R:  Well, see, my -- that's one of my fav- favorite hobbies --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- is being outdoors.  I mean, it's my husband's and that's why we're -- you know, it's our -- both of our hobbies.  But, I mean, um -- is gardening.  But like lately, depending on the time of the year, we've been meadow mushrooming.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, so, you know, we got -- go out to walk around and get -- in the [inaudible] and do that kinda thing.  And that -- we -- you know, that's a hobby, but it's only like at a certain time of the year hobby.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  You know?
L:  It's -- you're limited to the specific ...
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  You -- you got that right.
R:  You know, I mean, every year, I mean, we do it.  I mean, it's like something we have to do.  You know what I mean?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And we spend out- -- outdoors -- you know, we spend two to three hours a day --
L:  Wow!
R:  -- you know, when we can doing that.
L:  Right.  Right.  If the weather per- ...
R:  And -- and then we -- we are kind enough to give them to, um, older people that can't do that as well.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  But free of charges because we're good people, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  I mean, because it's a hobby as partners.
L:  Right.
R:  It's not because it's not -- it's not a chore.
L:  Right.
R:  It's something we want to do.
L:  You don't wanna make it as a business or something like that, yeah.
R:  It's just something that we enjoy doing.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's a hobby.  Mhm.
L:  That's great.  Yeah.  I -- I mean, that's something that I -- the other thing that I do besides, you know, playing tennis and the beach, I do work out, that's another hobby that -- hobby that I have and I do at least an hour of working every day and, you know, yoga and meditation and stuff.
R:  What did you say, how much working out every day?
L:  Um, about an hour to an hour to an hour and a half.
R:  Oh, an hour.  Okay.
L:  Yes.  In the mornings, either at home or I, you know -- I just r- recently joined a gym.  So, I try to fit that as part of my hobby.  That's something that I would -- wanted to fit it in my schedule on a daily basis.
R:  It's something you do as -- as a workout and something you want to do as well.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  So, something for you as a hobby and something you can do for your body at the same.
L:  Right.  Right.  For my spirit -- you know, for my spiritual and my -- well, for my mind and stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  So, interesting.  So, this is your third call and what, um ...?
R:  Yeah.  This is my third call.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, everybody's been so kind and easy, we just talk like this, like they've known you for [LAUGH] -- for ever, you know?
L:  Oh, interesting.
R:  And -- and so it's real --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- easy.
L:  That's fantastic.  Yeah, um, I actually had another call a few days ago, but I wasn't home.  So, I missed that phone call.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um ...
R:  That happens and if you don't wanna take any you don't have to.
L:  Okay.  I got it.  Okay.
R:  So ...
L:  No, but it's interesting.  As you say, it's a great, uh, communication tool.  You get to know other people around the world.  I've heard other people that are coming.  Some of them are from Europe too.  So ...
R:  And they get to learn from us what --
L:  Right.
R:  -- what's going on.
L:  Exactly.  Exactly.
R:  So ...
L:  Wow!  That's interesting.  So you ...
R:  And then they'll let us know when the ten minutes is up as well.
L:  Oh, okay.  So, they will ...
R:  So, we don't have to do that.  Yeah.
L:  Okay.  Okay.  So, do you have any children or, um ...?
R:  Um, I have one son.  I have two grandchildren now and I've --
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  -- got the hobbies.
L:  You don't sound --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you don't sound old enough to be a grandma.  [LAUGH]
R:  I'm only thirty eight.
L:  Oh, my God!
R:  So, yes.  But when they come over, you know, like I said, that's really -- I -- I could say that's a hobby --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- because when they come over here I get on and -- and we will make things and -- crafts and then we will print them out and --
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  -- and do things like that.  My grandson we just made him, um, some fingerprints with his hands, you know --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I made flowers out of them, pressed flowers out of his handprints.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  So, doing things like that, that's definitely our hobby [LAUGH], you know?
L:  Yeah.  It's -- it's a hobby and relaxing.
R:  It's not real ... Yes.  It's not really a hobby but yes, it is because, you know, it's -- it's relaxing --
L:  That's true.
R:  -- like it's cause of our grandchildren.  Yes.
L:  That's true.  That's true.  Wow!
R:  So ...  And everybody has different kinds of hobbies, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Some people don't consider that a hobby, they consider it as a chore.  [LAUGH]
L:  Right.  Right.  It all depends on an individual basis how they look at, you know, life and their -- their lifestyle.
R:  And some peop- ...
L:  Like to me being -- being around grandchildren is definitely something very enjoyable, as you said, a hob- ...
R:  Correct.  That's how I feel.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.
R:  But like you said, you know, one of the questions was, do you think everybody should have a hobby?  Y- yes, I think they should, but not everybody will or does, or --
L:  Right.
R:  -- even will admit that they have a hobby, you know?
L:  Exactly.
R:  So, it depends on your lifestyle too I think --
L:  Right.
R:  -- a lot of the time.
L:  Yeah, it -- definitely to me a hobby is definitely is a requirement in everybody's life.  Uh, on a daily basis you need to have some time to -- to yourself to do something that you really enjoy.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  And that's why I'm on the Internet all the time.  I don't do it -- I -- I mean, I do it for work --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- and I do it for pleasure.
L:  Oh, okay.  Okay.
R:  You know?
L:  Okay.  That's good.
R:  So, I mean, it's not just that I sit here.  I mean, it's not like -- I mean, um, my husband works and doesn't want me to work other than online at home.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, it makes it -- you know, I may as well work and get some money while I'm -- you know, working -- sitting at home --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so it's any worse than sitting at -- at a desk for eight hours.  You know what I mean?
L:  Right.
R:  May as well sit at home and do something, make -- try and make some money.
L:  Sure.  Sure.  Definitely.
R:  That's why I call the Internet my hobby --
L:  That's ...
R:  -- because I really do enjoy being on -- online.
L:  Okay.  What do you do on -- on -- as far as work?  Are you ...?
R:  Oh, like this.  I found this online.
L:  Okay.
R:  Um, mystery shopping jobs and such.
L:  That's great.  Yeah.
R:  Things like that I get.
L:  I'm actually, um -- I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- you know, have a lot of -- I've been chemical engineering and I've been in the field work with a lot of great companies like Ralph Law and Kelvin Kline and I got very tired of working for something else.  I've been in my business as a, uh, mystery shopping and merchandiser for almost seven years --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and I love it.  I -- you know, it's something that I very much enjoy.  That's something -- it's -- I call it a hobby too.  I don't look at my work as work.  I look at it as a hobby.  That's something that I really enjoy doing on a daily basis.
R:  Right.  That's what I said because that's where I got mine online --
L:  Right.
R:  -- like this jobs off online because that's -- that's -- that's what I enjoy doing.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's kinda like my hobby.
L:  Right.
R:  At the same time I'm getting work, but at the same time getting paid for it.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  It may not be a lotta money here and there but, you know, it depends on what you do.
L:  Yeah.  But, you know, you -- you gotta be patient.  That's something I tell my friends and stuff.  With the mystery shopping part or something like this you need to be very patient.  When I started this position seven years ago my accounts were about a dollar fifty a part.  Now when you build up your client basis you get a lot of clients and referrals and stuff, and that's something if be patient you can definitely build up.  So, don't give up on it.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I won't.  Like I said, I enjoy doing that.
L:  That's great.
R:  That's something that I'll definitely do as well.  So ...
L:  That's great.  I'm glad to hear that.
R:  And another hobby -- and since while we're doing this -- another hobby is meeting people.
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  You know?
L:  That's a- ...  Yeah.
R:  I mean, like either w- whereas now on the phone or in public it's still nice.
L:  Exactly.
R:  It's the same thing.  It's -- it's -- it's very pleasurable and relaxing.
L:  Right.  Right.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Getting to know people, getting -- getting to find out what their likes and dislikes are that's another thing.  Yeah, I definitely agree on that too.  Yes.
R:  So ...
L:  Wow!  So ...
R:  Oh, these must ...
L:  We hope to see you in California very soon.
R:  Say what?
L:  I said I -- we hope to you see in California very soon.
R:  Well, you know, I would like to but, gosh, it's -- it's -- but money is so tight.  You know what I mean?
L:  I know.  I know.
R:  So ...
L:  That's true.
R:  I would like to make traveling a hobby [LAUGH], but we don't --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- have the money for that.
L:  Yeah.  Everything you make it's all -- I know.  Yeah, I know nowadays making money is so hard.
R:  Well ...
L:  It's very difficult.
R:  And we just bought new vehicle.  So --
L:  Oh, congratulations.
R:  -- there goes all our money, you know?
L:  Oh, good.  Congratulations.
R:  So ...
L:  That's great.
R:  Um, let's see.  What else can we say about hobbies?
L:  Um ...
R:  Um, well, you know, I do have a -- I have a, uh -- a little wood house I've been making for -- a miniature house I should say --
L:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I've been collecting little things for that and putting it together.
L:  Wow!
R:  So, that's a woodworking hobby I guess.
L:  That's great.  Yeah, um, actually that's another hobby that I'm doing.  I, um -- my husband just got a job.  I'm trying to, um, making an office for him.  So, I'm putting --
