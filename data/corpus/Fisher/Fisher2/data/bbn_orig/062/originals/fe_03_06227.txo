L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  [LAUGH]  Hi.  This is --
L:  Hi.
R:  -- [inaudible] 
L:  My name's Sarah.
R:  Uh, this is Diane.
L:  How are you?
R:  Where are you from?
L:  I'm in St Louis.  
R:  Oh.  Wow.  I'm over in Pennsylvania.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, wow.  
R:  [LAUGH]  That's pretty [LAUGH] good distance there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  So the topic is hobbies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um.  I guess what comes to my mind first is cross stitch.  
R:  I've never done that but I've done quilting.  I've done, uh, oil painting.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I've done, uh, some crocheting.  Um, sewing.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Do you do quilting very often?
R:  I used to.  I don't, um, right now.  I have my grandson all the time and it's a little hard to get it -- really get into something like that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  'Cause I've thought about picking that up.
R:  Yeah, my mother in law taught me.  I even won fir- first prize at a, um, maple festival.
L:  Oh, wow. 
R:  [MN]  And that was the first time I ever entered [LAUGH] anything.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I was really surprised.
L:  Well, you must have been a good quilter.  
R:  Well, and she's a good quilter so I got taught by a good one.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [MN]  
R:  I don't -- [SIGH]  I don't really spend a whole lot of time on my hobbies now because of the little one.
L:  Yeah.  So you keep him, like, babysitting or ...?
R:  No.  We're raising him.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, are you?
R:  Yeah. 
L:  Oh, wow.  How old is he?
R:  He's five now.  We've had him since he was about a year, a year and a half.  Something like that.
L:  Yeah.  Wow.  
R:  It's not --
L:  I bet [MN] --
R:  -- what I wanted.  I'd rather be grandma but ...  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  Well, at least you're there for him.  
R:  Yeah.  He would've had a really tough time if we wouldn't a taken him in.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  How often do you work on your cross stitch?
L:  Um.  Gosh, it's hard to say.  It -- it sort of depends on the week because I like to do it, um, while I'm watching TV.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Just sit and cross stitch.  And the thing that I'm doing now is really detailed and so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it's hard because I constantly have to look and see, "Okay, what color?  Where should that be?"
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Sometimes I like 'em where I can just do rows and rows of the same [LAUGH] color.  
R:  Yeah.  It goes a lot faster.  
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  I -- I've done some embroidery.  I -- I've never done the cross stitch but I have done some embroidery.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So I know a little bit about what you're talking about.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Maybe -- I also like to read.  And I'd say I probably read like a half hour a day, I guess.  
R:  [MN]
L:  Something like that.  I try to read before I go to bed.  
R:  Oh.
L:  I have a son who's eleven.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  So, I mean, I know what you mean about having time but now as he's getting --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- older it's ...
R:  Yeah, and it [MN] -- they take care of things more themselves.
L:  Right.
R:  They don't need your constant attention.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  I -- I, um, play [MN] -- play around with the computer quite a bit.
L:  Oh, do you?
R:  Yeah.  It -- computer -- it's something that I can do and if I need to quit right away I can.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.  You mean play around, like, surfing the internet and stuff like that?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  [MN]  And I keep track of, uh, finances and all that kind of stuff on the computer too.
L:  Mhm.  Do you use, um, like Quicken[?] or something like that?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I -- I have an older version.  I -- I'm -- [MN] I didn't want to spend sixty bucks to [LAUGH] get a new one [LAUGH] yet. 
L:  Right.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Is that easy?  I mean, do you like doing --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- it that way?
R:  Yeah.  And from what I've heard, Quicken is much, much easier than what the, um, money is.  
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Microsoft Money.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause I do -- I have Quicken on my computer but I would try to use it and, I don't know, I just feel like I'm doing thing tw- -- things twice.  If I'm writing a check, you know, and then I have to enter it in there as well, you know?
R:  Yeah.  Uh, I -- I do it in there to make sure that I don't mess up in the checkbook, you know.  I- if I'm in a hurry with the check book and I make, you know, press the wrong key on [MN] uh, com- -- uh, calculator or something and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- yeah, it's messed up.  
L:  Yeah, that's true.  That makes sense.  
R:  And then I can -- it's easier to balance your checkbook using the computer.
L:  Mhm.
R:  A lot easier.  Tha- that's one plus there.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And plus I can bring up a chart that shows where [MN] what money we're spending.  Where it's going and all that stuff.
L:  Yeah.  That -- that part I did like about it.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Because you can see exactly where your money goes.  Well, and plus the -- the problem that I had was, you know, all the with- withdrawals that you don't know where that money really [LAUGH] went.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then you see how big a portion of your budget that is.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, [MN] there -- there are a lot, um, [LIPSMACK] like, categories and stuff, um -- usually I can keep track of, you know, where the money has gone --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- by those categories.  You can add your own categories also.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, okay.  
R:  I -- I added quite a few, because we have a small farm and I had to add the, you know, farm --
L:  Expenses.
R:  -- uh, areas into it.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  And you can make up your own too, because I've done that already.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  
R:  Yeah, like, if you get a rebate or something from your taxes --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and don't know where to put it.  
L:  Yeah.  [inaudible] 
R:  So I -- I just put one tax rebate and, you know, with no, um, no connection with the tax form or anything like that.  That way, you know, at least I have a category to put it in.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  
L:  [MN]  
R:  The quilt that I did -- that I won the prize with was a, [LIPSMACK] um, [inaudible], I think is what it was called.  
L:  What was it called?
R:  [MN]  [inaudible].  It -- it's like a Pennsylvania dutch type thing.  It has, uh --
L:  Oh, really?  Huh.
R:  It had, um, birds on it and flowers and hearts and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  It -- it was really pretty.  I still have it.  I won't get rid of it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh yeah.  I was just going to ask if you still had it.  
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  That -- that's one that -- that's my little prize, so I don't want to get rid of it.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Plus I can't make another one right now, anyhow.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I could see putting up a big quilt frame, Brandon would be trying to jump on it and everything [LAUGH] else.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  So he's not at school yet, or is he in kindergarten or ...?
R:  Um, he's in -- he just turned five so he -- he's just in pre school.
L:  For next year.  Oh, okay.  
R:  And, uh, but that's only three days a week, and he's upset that this month is gonna be the last of the pre school.  
L:  Oh, is he really?  Wow.
R:  He -- he really liked it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  That's good.
R:  I just hope he -- [MN] he likes the kindergarten just as well.  [MN]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I just got my degree to be a teacher recently.
R:  [LIPSMACK]  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Congratulations.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Thanks.  I'm excited.  I don't think I'll ever teach kindergarten though.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  I think that'd be kind of a tough group. 
L:  Yeah.  It is.  'Cause they're, um --
R:  [MN]  What grades are you going to be teaching?
L:  I would like to teach, like, first, second or third.  
R:  Tho- those are pretty good grades.  They --
L:  Yeah.
R:  When you get up into the later high school grades it -- I think they get tough.
L:  I know.  I do too.  I don't see how people can do that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mm, I don't know.  [COUGH] 
L:  I guess it just depends on what you like though.  
R:  Yeah.  Well, we had -- I have had some teachers though, when I was in school, that they shouldn't have been teaching.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  You know, they come into the room, read this, do the questions, and they walk out.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Right.  
R:  You know --
L:  [several inaudible words] 
R:  -- that's not teaching.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, exactly.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  [inaudible].
R:  And, well, the only time they come back is if we get too noisy.  [LAUGH] 
L:  So they would just leave the room?
R:  Yeah.  
L:  Wow, that's surprising, yeah.  
R:  They would leave for the whole period.  
L:  Oh, my gosh.  That was, like, in high school.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Wow.  
R:  Yeah, I think that was, um, tenth grade or something.  You know, it's been a while because I'm --
L:  Right.
R:  -- older.  But, you know, that -- [MN] they left the whole time.  
L:  Wow.  
R:  And I -- apparently they didn't get told about it because they continued it through the -- throughout the year.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah, see we can't leave the classroom now.  
R:  [MN]  That's good.  [LAUGH]  You know.
L:  I know.  
R:  You know, for -- especially in an infant, like that.  
L:  Right.  
R:  What -- what, um, your, uh, cross stitch.  What kind of picture is it?
L:  It's a picture of a baby in a bathtub.
R:  Oh, is it? Cute.
L:  Yeah, it's really cute.  I mean it'll look really good --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- when it's done because it's like the expert level.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And that's why it's so detailed.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And it's kind of funny because a couple of years ago a friend of mine wanted to learn how to do it and she picked out this, um, what do you call it?  Well, she picked out this one to cross stitch.  And I said, "Are you sure you want to do that?"  And she was like, "Yeah".  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And then she never got started on it.
R:  Oh, no.
L:  I -- I mean I realised it was expert later.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So I just kept it and then, uh -- any time I finish a cross stitch project I always am itching to start a new one.  
R:  Uh-huh.  [LAUGH] 
L:  And, um, so I started it and I don't know how long it's gonna take me.  It'll probably take me a while because it's --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so detailed.
R:  Yeah. 
L:  But ...
R:  But, when it's -- when it's done you really have something to show for it though.
L:  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.
R:  That's they way I felt about the
