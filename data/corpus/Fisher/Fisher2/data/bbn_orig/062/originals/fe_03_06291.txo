R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, there.  This is Ethel.
L:  This is who?
R:  Ethel. Who is this?
L:  Uh, hi, this is Caroline.
R:  Hi, Caroline.  We are supposed to talk about our hobbies.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, do you wanna go first, or do you want me to go first?
L:  Go ahead first.
R:  Okay.  Well, my hobby that I'm interested in at the moment is art.  Um, I'm doing drawing and painting and I've been interested in it for many years and I'm taking a class, um, I live in California and I'm taking a class at the local college and, uh, I find it very interesting and then I probably spend oh, maybe one to two hours a night --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- drawing --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- and, um, I find it very enjoyable.  The time just flies by.  You don't even realize that -- you sit down and you start drawing and you think you're gonna do it for ten minutes and before you know it you look up and two hours --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- have gone by.  It's just amazing.  It's just -- what happens is you get totally involved in it.  It's just a whole lot of fun and I really enjoy it.
L:  Oh, that's interesting.  My hobby is, uh, exercise, sport, uh --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and I love, uh, go to gym with my daughter and my friend and ...
R:  Oh, nice.
L:  Yeah.  I just came back from walking --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because when I come in [inaudible].  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh ...
R:  How long have you been doing that?
L:  Uh, actually I'm doing for about maybe two years --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, we go out for five times a week and usually at night.
R:  You go to a gym?
L:  Gym and ...
R:  You go to a gym?
L:  Right.
R:  Mhm.  Oh, my goodness, five nights a week.
L:  And I live in California too.
R:  So do I.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I do some, um, walking around my neighborhood.  After dinner every night I go out and take a nice long walk, walk off some of the ...
L:  Oh, that's nice.  Which area do you live, which neighborhood?
R:  Uh, Santa Monica.
L:  O- oh, really?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I live in [inaudible].
R:  Oh, really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Not that far.
L:  Mm.  This is interesting.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Can I ask you a question?
R:  Sure.
L:  Is this the forwarding survey from Craig's List?
R:  Is it what?
L:  Uh, the way that we are talking to each other, does it belong to phone survey that, uh, we register?
R:  Right.  Uh-huh.
L:  Mm.
R:  I -- actually I just called this afternoon and registered and they told me it would take twenty four hours before I would be in the system, but I guess they already put me in it.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, I didn't even call them yet.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.  I ...
R:  You haven't called?
L:  No.  I ...
R:  Well, how would they get your phone number?
L:  Uh, actually I replied by email.
R:  Oh, you did it through email?
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, they must've just automatically connected you up.
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I did it by the phone because I don't have a computer in my home, but I --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- use one at the library.  So, I figured --
L:  Oh, that's interesting.
R:  -- it's better to just do it by phone.
L:  And how old are you?
R:  I'm fifty nine.
L:  Oh, fifty nine.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I'm forty two.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  And do you have kids or anything?
R:  I have one daughter --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and a grandson.  They live down in the San Diego area.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  And my grandson's very interested in art too.  So, it's a lot of fun when they come up here --
L:  Oh, it runs in your family.
R:  -- you know, he -- he does his drawing and I do mine and it's, you know -- it's kind of a thing we -- we both have together that we do.  So, it's -- it's good.  It's a hobby for both of us.
L:  Yeah, that's interesting.
R:  And yours is the same way.  You said you do it with your daughter.
L:  Yeah, I'm doing it with -- my daughter is a teenager --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- she's nineteen.
R:  Yeah.  That's good.
L:  So, I'm ...
R:  It's good to find something that you have in common --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- that you both enjoy doing and then you can do it together and you both are happy.
L:  Yeah.  That's interesting.
R:  Mhm.
L:  It's nice to talk to you.  And what else we should talk about?  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, I'm just trying to remember now.  They said that we should talk about the hobby that we like and, um ...
L:  Yeah.  Uh, what are you doing for a living?
R:  For a living?
L:  Mhm.
R:  You mean where do I live?
L:  No.  No.  Are you working, or are you retired?
R:  No.  I'm -- I'm on disability.
L:  Oh.  [NOISE]
R:  So, I don't work.  So, I have spare time to pursue any kind of hobbies that I want to --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- which is kind of nice and, like I said, one of them I've chosen is getting --
L:  Mhm.  [NOISE]
R:  -- involved in art and -- but I also do, like you said, the exercise.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I -- I took a yoga class.  Have you done that?
L:  Oh, that sounds good.
R:  Have you done that?  That's lots of ...
L:  Actually, uh, no, I never, uh, I go to aerobic classes at the gym --
R:  Oh, you do aerobics?  Mhm.
L:  -- but not yoga.
R:  Yeah.  I've done yoga and I tried ...
L:  I've heard that's really health- and relax and ...
R:  Yes, it does, and Tai Chi, have you ever tried that?
L:  No.  No.
R:  I tried that too except oh, my goodness, it uses every muscle in your body.
L:  Oh.
R:  You have to be in good shape to do that, but you kinda work up to it.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah.  The other hobby is, um, shopping though.
R:  Shopping?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Clothes shopping, right?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Window shopping, so ...
R:  Oh, I think we -- all of us women like to do that.
L:  All the ladies has come and done that.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's a great hobby.  Also I do gardening.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I enjoy that --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- 'cause I have -- I have an apartment where I have a little yard and a garden.  So, I get all involved in that and that's good exercise too --
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  -- gardening because, you know, the digging and pulling and everything else you --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- use all your muscles.  So, there's ways to exercise where you can, you know, enjoy doing something else too.  I never really enjoyed aerobics.  I found it just kinda got boring.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  But, like I said, other ways like, you know, gardening --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- is still a type of exercise.
L:  Yeah.  And, uh, that's all.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] I know.  It's kinda strange to have ten minutes to talk.
L:  Oh, ten minutes?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh.
R:  They said -- I -- I've done this before.
L:  Oh, I've ...  You did this before? 
R:  No, I've never done it before.
L:  Yeah.  I ...
R:  You're the first person that they connected me too and --
L:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- they said ten minutes.  So, hey, I think --
L:  Nice experience, huh?
R:  -- I think we're doing just fine to tell you the truth.  [LAUGH]
L:  But they find the right people doing the same, uh, as maybe ...
R:  I know.  I guess they -- they must figure around the same age and then same neighborhood and --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and same interests, although, uh, they don't really know.  They probably just ...
L:  Yeah, they don't, but ...
R:  Actually I think it's a very interesting thing for them [LIPSMACK] to see how people can relate to each other --
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.
R:  -- and converse with each other.
L:  What they want to find out from this, you know, research?   This is something strange I believe.
R:  I guess ...
L:  The hobbies of people maybe in ...?
R:  Well, I think -- I think they're picking different things.  They told me they would -- you know, either like politics or television or different things.
L:  Oh, so every day's gonna be different, huh?
R:  So, I guess whenever they call you or you call them --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um [LIPSMACK], they will tell you a subject.
L:  They will tell you a project.
R:  So, this time was hobbies.  So, this is our first time.  So, hey, I think we're -- we're doing okay hopefully.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Although they may be sitting and laughing at us right now and saying, "Oh, these ladies don't know what they're talking about".  But ...
L:  If somebody's listening to us, hey, maybe they record too.
R:  Oh, yeah, it's gonna be recorded and I guess they see how people relate to each other, you know?
L:  Mhm.
R:  And, uh, it's good.  It should be interesting.
L:  Yeah, that's ...
R:  I figure hey, we're gonna help out with research, plus we'll get ten dollars each time besides.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I mean, what ...?
L:  You get ten dollars for ten minutes --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- that's something --
R:  Yeah, a dollar a minute.
L:  -- and find new people.  That's really nice.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I think it's kind of interesting thing.  I thought it would kinda be fun to do.  [LAUGH]
L:  So, you find that by Craig's List, right?
R:  I find what?
L:  Uh, you find these, uh, phone, uh, by Craig's List, right, online or by L.A. Weekly?
R:  No.
L:  Because I ...
R:  It was the L.A. Weekly.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's how --
L:  I saw it in the L.A. ...
R:  -- I saw it in the paper, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Hm, that sounds interesting.  Um, what else?  Let me tell you more about my hobbies.
R:  All right.
L:  My other hobby is traveling as well.  I really enjoy ...
R:  Oh, do you travel?
L:   Yeah.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Uh, traveling.  Actually I love gambling that's ...
R:  Oh, you go to Vegas a lot?
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  Ha, ha, ha.
L:  Clothes and --
R:  So ...
L:  -- I usually come home with lots of money.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But I don't have that luck anymore.  [LAUGH]
R:  Well, gamblers don't last for long.  They may start out with good luck, but it usually turns bad.
L:  Exactly.  Yeah.
R:  Do you go to Las Vegas a lot and ...?
L:  A lot, right.
R:  And Loftland[?], Nevada?
L:  Mm.  Actually I -- I once go to Loftland and I didn't like it --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- because when you go to Las Vegas you don't like any other place even --
R:  No, that's true.
L:  -- Atlantic City I went there and New York.
R:  No, that's true.
L:  I didn't like it.
R:  Las Vegas is the nicest.
L:  Yeah.
R:  No, Loftland is very boring.
L:  Exactly.
R:  There's -- I mean, unless -- the riverboat is kinda nice to go on --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, that's an unusual different thing.  But, you know, how many times can you go on a little riverboat?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  But the price there is much cheaper than Las Vegas.
R:  Oh, yes.  I think that's why it draws a lot of people --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- a lot of people who have RVs and so forth.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Have you ever taken a cruise?
L:  Uh, actually, yeah.  I went to Hawaii --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and as I tell you the hobbies, uh, uh -- what do you call? -- is traveling.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But, uh, I get sea sick.
