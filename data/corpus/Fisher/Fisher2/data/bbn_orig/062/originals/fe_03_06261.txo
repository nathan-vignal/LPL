R:  Hi.  I'm Cheryl.  I'm in Pennsylvania.

R:  Oh, you're Karen?
L:  Yes.
R:  I'm Cheryl.
L:  Cheryl?
R:  Yes.
L:  Okay.
R:  Hi, nice to know you.
L:  Uh, nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Um, we're supposed to discuss hobbies.
L:  Yeah.  What are your hobbies?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Well, I don't have a lot of time for hobbies unfortunately because I work a lot, but I, um -- I really like to read and I like to, um, work with flowers.
L:  Oh, wow!  Like arrangement?
R:  Um, I like doing that, but I also like planting them and -- and that type of thing.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.  And, um, I like music and, uh, traveling.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  How 'bout you?  What do you do for a hobby?
L:  Um, I like to bake.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  I actually went to, um, baking school.
R:  Oh, how exciting.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And ...
R:  What kinds of things do you bake?
L:  Well, I -- I mainly specialize in cheesecakes.
R:  Oh, boy!
L:  Yeah.
R:  I bet that's popular.  [LAUGH]
L:  It is.  [LAUGH]  Yeah.
R:  Do you make them for money or just for friends and family or ...?
L:  Um, I make them for my family for fun and I also sell them on the side.
R:  Oh, okay.  Well, good 'cause that's ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  That's just like my -- another -- like second job on the side.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Um ...
R:  Okay.  What else do you like to do besides that?
L:  I like shopping.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]  You gotta have money for that though.
L:  Yeah, I know.
R:  So, that stinks.
L:  So, I -- I go crazy for like sample sales and, you know ...?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  Like, I'm -- I -- like once I waited in line like one hour before the store even opened.  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-oh.  [LAUGH]  That, uh -- that sounds like you're a -- a big shopper.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, I like traveling too.
R:  Do you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you traveled anywhere far from, uh -- from the -- the U.S.?
L:  Um, this year I went to Hawaii.
R:  That's -- that wonderful.  I'd love to go there.
L:  And then a month later I went to the Bahamas.
R:  [MN]
L:  That was nice.
R:  I've never been there.  I'd love to go there too.
L:  Yeah, you should.
R:  Yeah, I should.
L:  It's beautiful.
R:  I guess the furthest I've been is Australia.
L:  And how was that?
R:  It's wonderful.
L:  Wow!  I'd like to go there one day.
R:  Wonderful.  Yeah.  I was there for a couple of months and it was, uh -- it was wonderful, just ...
L:  Wow, a couple of months?
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Did you have ...?
R:  It was a fantastic country.
L:  Do you have friends there?
R:  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  Oh, that's ...
R:  My husband's Australian.
L:  Oh, cool!
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, that's about the furthest that I've been, but I -- I like to travel but, again, that takes quite a bit of money.  So, one --
L:  Yeah.  I know it.
R:  -- one of the things that they asked about, um, for the topic was, do you think people need hobbies and how much time should they spend?  And I really think people desperately need hobbies.  I think ...
L:  I -- I agree.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause there's so much spare time and I don't know, people just shouldn't be bored.
R:  I -- I ...
L:  They should always --
R:  Right.  I agree with you. 
L:  -- they should always like occupy themselves with something or find something they like to do and pursue it.
R:  Right.  I -- I think people do an awful lot of passive, um, wasting of time --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- like watching T.V. and that type of thing and -- and that's okay if that's what they choose to do.  Everybody has the right to ...
L:  Yeah.  As long as they're not like sad or complaining about that they have nothing to do.
R:  Right.  Right.  I think it's great to have a balance of, um, time for work, time for hobbies, time for --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- relaxing, um, that type of thing.  Unfortunately I think most of us probably don't have as much of a balance.  I -- I don't.  Right now I'm working --
L:  'Cause you work?
R:  -- too much.  Yeah.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Too much and don't have enough time for hobbies.  So ...
L:  Oh, that's a good excuse though.
R:  No.  It's -- It's unfortunate.  But when I -- when I do -- like today I had an unexpected, um, day that I didn't have to work.  It was very unexpected.  So, I spent time, um, planting some flowers in pots for my deck.
L:  Oh, wow, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  And I really enjoyed it.
L:  What kinda flowers?
R:  Yeah.  I enjoyed that, all kinds of different ones.
L:  Oh, cool!
R:  Yeah.  Different colors.  So, I really -- I mean, when I have a chance to -- to be at home, which unfortunately isn't happening very often right now --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- but, um, I -- I do try to do something like that because it just kinda removes me.
L:  Oh.
R:  You know, makes -- makes me -- makes me a better person and makes me feel better about the world in general.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause, you know, life is short.
R:  Mhm.  Right.  Right.  And I -- I don't have any major talents as far as art or anything is concerned.  I -- I love art and I like to go to, um, museums and --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- galleries and things like that, but --
L:  Yeah.  I like doing those too.
R:  -- but I don't really -- I'm not good at it -- good enough at it or -- or schooled in it.  So, I don't paint or anything like that.  My mother -- my mother was good enough -- she is good enough at it.  She doesn't do it anymore, but she used to paint and do that kinda thing.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I used to -- I used to paint too and draw.
R:  Oh, did you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  'Cause I went to -- I went to an art high school.
R:  Oh, that's great.
L:  Yeah.  So, that required me to do like all types of art, like photography, printing, maybe design, architecture and all that.
R:  Mhm.  Do you do any of those things for hobbies now?
L:  Um, I don't -- not much.
R:  No.
L:  No, I don't.
R:  Yeah.  I think as we go through life we change what we enjoy doing for hobbies too.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I mean, I've always liked -- I've always liked reading.  But I read -- oh, I read a lot of different things maybe now from what I did when I was younger.  So, my taste has changed.  But I -- I've changed some other -- some of my hobbies too.  I didn't really use to enjoy traveling and once I traveled -- I started to travel a bit and then I -- I realized how great, um, a thing it is to do because it just enriches the person so much.
L:  Yeah, and there's like so many places to go.
R:  Absolutely.
L:  And you're never gonna get to go to all of them.
R:  That's right.  I would love to go to Hawaii.  You mentioned Hawaii --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- and I'd really -- that would be -- be lovely.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I'd like to go to Tahiti.
L:  [MN] Me too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, my God, me too.  I saw a picture of it --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it was beautiful.
R:  Well, when I went to Australia I had made arrangements to go to Tahiti on the way home and I ended up canceling that and staying in Australia longer.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  So, I kinda missed out there, but I'm hoping that one day maybe we can afford to go there, or Fiji, or some place like that --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's ... Yeah.
L:  I -- I think it's expensive though.
R:  It -- it is fairly expensive, but I figured since I was already going to Australia and it was --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- you know, on the way sort of [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah, it is.
R:  -- I would go.  But, uh, um, I think traveling is just -- it's not a waste of time in any way.  I've met --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so many different kinds of people and so forth.
L:  Yeah.  And you get to try different types of food --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- 'cause I also like to eat too.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, me too.  Me too.  Uh, I was thinking about the different restaurants I had been to in Australia and I would have to say that the best one I was at was a Chinese restaurant --
L:  Really?
R:  -- in Sydney.  Yeah.  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They have a -- a very large Chinese population there and they have wonderful ...
L:  They do?
R:  Yeah, they do.
L:  Oh, I'm Chinese myself.
R:  Are you?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, I tell ya, there are a lot -- it's -- it's a wonderful Chinatown area in Sydney and they have -- I had the best Chinese food I've ever had there and I've been to Toronto where they have excellent Chinese food and some other places too.  But I'll tell ya what the Chinese food in Sydney was spectacular.
L:  Oh.  Have you been to, um, New York?
R:  Yes, but not for years.
L:  Oh.
R:  Have you?
L:  I live here, yeah.
R:  Oh, you live in New York?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, that's g- -- there's so many things to do there --
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  -- as far as hobbies are concerned.
L:  Yeah.
R:  You live right in the city?
L:  No, I live in Queens.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Yeah.  But I work in the city.  So, I'm there like almost every day.
R:  Oh, boy!  So, if you -- if you like, like music or art or --
L:  Yeah, I love it.
R:  -- anything like that oh, that's ...
L:  I like eighties -- eighties music.
R:  Oh, do you really?  I do too.
L:  Like new wave and stuff.
R:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's great.  I -- I would love to -- to go to New York and -- and -- again and see some things.  Like, I really wanna see the Blue Man Group.
L:  Oh, I've seen that.  You should -- you should go.
R:  Yeah.  I would love to 'cause I like --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I love things -- I like the theater and I like, um, classical music too and, uh, any kind of -- almost all kinds of music really.  I'm not really a big fan of country music but ...
L:  Yeah, me either.
R:  Yeah.  But I -- I do like, uh, popular music and I like classical and, um, all kinds of -- all kinds of music, folk music, and my husband sings -- plays the guitar and I enjoy that.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool.
R:  So ... Yeah.
L:  Do you ...?
R:  And I like to sing as well.
L:  Do you play any instrument?
R:  You know, I really -- I'm not any good -- I -- I dabble a little bit and -- and I can read music and so on.  But I sing more than anything else.  I like to sing.
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I ...
L:  I have no like music skills whatsoever.  [LAUGH]
R:  Really?  [LAUGH]
L:  No.
R:  Have you tried?
L:  No.
R:  You haven't tried it, huh?  You're not interested in trying?
L:  No.
R:  Well, I think people kinda usually know whether they -- they have a talent for that or not.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, you know, the thing is I find that people who are professional at something like music or art then like they're -- they're sort of sometimes finding a hobby that's dr- drastically different from that.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  I mean, like I -- I have a -- a friend who ...
L:  Have -- they have more options.
R:  Yeah.  I have a friend who's a sculptor and, um, he's very, very good.  He's, you know, had a lotta pieces commissioned and so on.  But what he does for a hobby is -- is he hunts and fishes.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.
