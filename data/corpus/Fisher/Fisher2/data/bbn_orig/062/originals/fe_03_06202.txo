L:  Hi, my name is Lisa.
R:  My name is Robyn.
L:  Hi, Robyn.
R:  How you doing?
L:  Good.  What's your favorite hobby?
R:  [NOISE] I like doing crafts.  I like making, um, [LIPSMACK] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- soaps and [LAUGH] [NOISE] various other little crafts like that.
L:  [NOISE] Right.  Do you sell the crafts or do you just do 'em for personal use, or do you --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- give them away as gifts?
R:  I mostly give 'em as gifts.  I do use some --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- for myself and my family.
L:  Right.
R:  But, uh --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- no, I never thought about selling it. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  How about you?
L:  Um, actually I think my hobby would be shopping.  Huh.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I, uh -- it really is.  I mean, I don't work right now, so I -- my parents are handicapped, so I started shopping for them when I lost my, uh, job, and I just cut out coupons and shop for them, and it just became a hobby trying to, uh, you know, get stuff for free and, um, I'm in New York and I double discount.  You know, I --
R:  Yeah, me too.  [LAUGH]
L:  You know, right.  So, uh, I just usually do a lot of shopping and I just -- became a hobby because I can't call it a job! [LAUGH]
R:  Well, if you got paid for it. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I mean, it's rewarding to me because usually I pay for everything, you know, for my parents.  So, uh, you know, whatever I save is, you know, kind of what I'm getting paid.
R:  Yeah, that's nice.
L:  And, um, yeah, my, uh, husband and I support them, so --
R:  Oh, that's really nice.
L:  Yeah, so I figured that, you know, there'll be a [inaudible] and I [inaudible] to what I used to be, in retail I was a manager.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, you know, I've handled, you know, I've worked in retail a long time and I know that side, so, um, I -- I enjoy doing the shopping and getting things at a discount and getting money back and --
R:  Me too. [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know. [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  And getting stuff like that, so I, uh, I think I spend sometimes too much time because --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I end up, you know --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- getting caught up in it all day and bet- between cutting out the coupons and sorting stuff and then going shopping --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I could spend every single day doing it. [NOISE]
R:  Oh, I could too! [NOISE] [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes, I'm always at the store or in here.  When I can get those free minutes where my kids are like, in school. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Right.
R:  Yeah.  But like, yeah --
L:  Oh, they're in -- oh, they're in school, uh, near you, not at college school?
R:  No, I have a four year old and a ten year old.
L:  Right.
R:  So, like, I bring her to a craft class and we do crafts together. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And then like, when -- on the days when she's at her actual school [inaudible] I can get my shopping done. [LAUGH]
L:  Do you live in New York?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Do you have a Michael's near you also?
R:  That's where she goes.
L:  Oh, I was gonna say, 'cause I knew that they had, um, [SIGH] a craft store -- a craft class at Michael's.
R:  Yeah, it's wonderful.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And they have adult crafts.  I -- everytime I go there I wanna do a different one. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I'm not a crafty person, I only knew about it, and actually I recommend it 'cause I know that they do birthday parties.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, one of my friends had had one and sh- -- you know, for her daughter -- and she said they did a really nice job, so --
R:  Yeah, I n- -- I never was like, crafty until I started seeing the stuff that -- in that store.
L:  I know.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  You know what?  I see the stuff in the store and I don't know what I would do with it! [LAUGH]
R:  Well, like, the soaps and stuff make nice presents.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, I mean, you know, the country really, um --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- that's not my style.
L:  Right, exactly.  And I'm allergic to like, lots of eucalyptus, you know, eucalyptus and all that other dried flowers and stuff.  So --
R:  [NOISE] Yeah, no, I don't use any of that. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So usually when I see those things -- but I've bought a lotta like, the little glass jars that are like, ruffled on the top, I forgotten what they call them.
R:  Yeah, I know what you're saying. [NOISE]
L:  And I put in, you know, potpourri in them and use them.
R:  Well, they have a thing at Michael's called --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- Liquid Rainbow [NOISE].
L:  Right.
R:  And -- and you can decorate those little -- their jars.
L:  Oh really?
R:  Yeah.  Like, w- we did that for Mothers' Day for my mother in law and for my mother. [LAUGH]
L:  Right.
R:  And --
L:  Oh, that's nice.
R:  Yeah.  [NOISE] And it's simple, so if l- -- if like you're not very handy with that stuff --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it looks sorta like stained glass.
L:  Right.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Anyway, I always like, looked at them and I'm like, "Hm, I wonder what I could do?"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  Like, I see all the raw wood and, you know, things that you could design on them, and then I go -- I go to the flea market and then I see them, [LAUGH] you know, already done.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I'm like --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, they charge you highway robbery, you know, in the places like Robin's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- Room on it.
R:  Exactly.
L:  You know.  [LAUGH]  So you might as well do it yourself.
R:  Exactly.
L:  When the phase with the, uh, jeans with the, um, fabric on the bottom was in like, last year or the year before whenever it was.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I did that.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I bought the fabric myself and then put it on the bottom of my jeans.  I, you know, got my glue [LAUGH] --
R:  Yeah. [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH] So that was the craftiest I've been --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the, [LAUGH] you know, so far.
R:  [MN] [NOISE]
L:  Where in New York do you live?
R:  I'm up by West Point.
L:  Oh okay.  My -- actually I went to a wedding at West Point.  One of my friend- --
R:  Oh, where are you?
L:  I'm in Long Beach on Long Island.
R:  Yeah, my husband works in Brooklyn.
L:  Mhm.  Oh, that's good.
R:  He's a fireman. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, there you go.
R:  [LAUGH] Half of -- half of, uh, the Fire Department lives on Long Island.
L:  Right.  And everybody from Long Island works out there anyway, you know, in Brooklyn or New York City.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So we have our own, uh, Fire Department in town but I don't even think most of them are Long Beach residents.
R:  Hm.
L:  You know, it's [MN] -- it's weird because it's not, you know, it's its own city, so I would think more people would be, you know, from Long Beach to be a Long Beach fireman, but ... whatever.
R:  See -- see, a lot of those towns have volunteers 'cause --
L:  Yeah, we have a volunteer Fire Department too.
R:  Yeah.  'Cause, you know, when he's not working as a fireman he's a -- he volunteers.
L:  Right.
R:  Yes.
L:  As a fireman.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I think that like, fire fighting is his hobby. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] I was just gonna say that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And --
R:  That and working on my house. [LAUGH]
L:  What?
R:  That and working on my house.
L:  Well that's helpful.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's crafty in itself.  My --
R:  Yeah, we'll do --
L:  My --
R:  [several inaudible words] --
L:  My husband ca- -- yeah, my husband can't hold the screwdriver --
R:  Oh! [MN]
L:  So [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  No, he -- my husband pretty much built my house.
L:  Right.  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah, and we're redoing everything a lot and I've been redoing my garden.
L:  Right.
R:  But I guess that's another hobby.  [NOISE] [LAUGH] 'Cause I'm --
L:  Yeah, I [MN] --
R:  You know, I'm learning.  I -- I mean I'm a city person --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I know nothing about gardens.
L:  Right.
R:  So, yeah. [NOISE]
L:  I don't, uh, I've always lived on the Island and I don't know anything about --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- gardening 'cause one of my best friends, he loves gardening, so whenever like, my parents needed something done or anywhere that I've lived, he's always done it.  And --
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah, and I have, um --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- long nails and I'm not big into dirt --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- so [LAUGH]. [SIGH]
R:  Oh, after my last kid mine all came off.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Uh, I tried --
L:  I think it [NOISE] -- yeah, I haven't had any kids yet, so --
R:  Oh. [LAUGH]
L:  I, uh, [LAUGH] I still have all the time during the day while everybody is out, you know, and I make all my calls and do my shopping and, you know, have my own freedom. [LAUGH]
R:  It's nice.
L:  Right now.  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] [NOISE]
L:  So --
R:  It's definitely [inaudible].
L:  -- I listen -- I listen to my friends to the phone, "Hold on, I gotta yell at so and so" --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- you know, and I just --
R:  Yeah, I'm one of them.
L:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I figure that one day --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that'll be me.  And it's so funny, it's like it's not just like, one friend, it's like anybody I call that has kids are like, "Hold on". [SIGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Uh, you know it's something to look forward to. [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE] Well, the phone's a bit of a magnet for kids.
L:  Right.
R:  They see ya on there and that's exactly when they need to know something.
L:  That's what my friend said.
R:  Mhm.
L:  She said whenever she's on it, you know, they're fine until the phone rings.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  You know, [MN], "Oh, sorry to hear that, gotta go". [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.
L:  You know, there c- -- there comes a point --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- where you just can't do it anymore.
R:  Oh yeah.
L:  I -- you could at least be outside today gardening, it's a beautiful day.
R:  Yeah, I was.
L:  Mhm.
R:  I was, I was putting in a fountain outside. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  So and then [SIGH] --
L:  [MN] [NOISE]
R:  Just try to get stuff down around here, I have somebody come into a [NOISE] --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- like a l- -- put in like, window treatments to give me ideas on what I'm gonna do. [NOISE]
L:  Right.
R:  So [SIGH] my house --
L:  Oh good.
R:  -- had to look halfway decent. [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Well, they probably figure you're in repair stage anyway and remodelling, so --
R:  Yeah.  But --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- it has to be clean, yeah.
L:  Right.  Like when the cleaner lady comes the house has to be clean.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Uh [LAUGH] --
R:  That's how I was brought up.
L:  Right, I hear ya.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] And how did you hear --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- about the, um, the study?
R:  I found it on the Internet someplace in like, one of the shopping sites.
L:  Right.
R:  It's funny 'cause my brother is a graduate of University of Pennsylvania, who's running it.
L:  Really?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh really?
R:  [NOISE]
L:  That's so weird.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah, I was telling my husband about it and he was like, "What do you do when it's some scam blah blah blah?" and I said, "Why don't you just do it also?"  I'm like, you know, "It'll be fun".  I said, you know, "What is it gonna hurt?"  So I showed him the printout and he got more calls already than I have.  Like, I always call in, you know, I mean I've only called twice but the first time I was doing it on my cellphone and I got disconnected.
R:  Uh --
L:  So, uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- like, if I'm home, I just happen to come in I'm like, oh, you know, it's after two, let me call --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and see.  But he gets calls all the time.
R:  Oh no, I just signed up the other day.
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, well, I signed up like, maybe a couple of weeks ago but the next day after I find out they called me --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- that was the one that got disconnected, and then I forgot about it and then I saw that it was still going, so I called in and he still gets calls, so I figured it was still on.
R:  [NOISE] Really?
L:  And I just walked in for a little while, so I'm y- like, you know what, let me call on my cellphone while I'm in the house 'cause I know I won't get disconnected.
R:  See, I -- I call from my regular phone. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  My cellphone's out in the car. [NOISE]
L:  [SIGH] Right, uh --
R:  I never -- I never remember to bring it in.
L:  You know, what?  I carry my cellphone on me all the time because if I'm on the computer in the house I can't get, um, phone calls --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- 'cause I disconnected, you know, my call waiting and --
R:  Yeah, no.
L:  -- I don't wanna sign up, so everyone knows if they don't get me at home I'm always on my cellphone.
R:  Yeah, I have a cable modem. [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  One day.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.
L:  So, I figured -- and I used to have Web TV and I used to get disconnected every time --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- somebody would call.
R:  My mother had that.  It drove me crazy.
L:  +Oh, it drove me crazy too on my --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  The first thing I'm buying --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- myself is a computer but my birthday was in April so my husband bought it for me then.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I'm like, you know, I'm not the best at it but any
