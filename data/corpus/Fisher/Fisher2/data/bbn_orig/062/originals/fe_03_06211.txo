R:  -- Yvonne from Virginia.
L:  Hey, Yvonne.  I'm Kristin from Chicago.
R:  From Chicago, okay.
L:  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.
R:  Sounds like we have an easy topic today. [LAUGH]
L:  I know!  I was like, "Yay!" [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Um --
R:  So what are your hobbies? [LAUGH]
L:  My hobbies -- I like gardening.
R:  Gardening, really?
L:  I'm a big gardener.
R:  Could probably get some good tips from you. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh yeah? [LAUGH]
R:  We have a huge garden and my husband is really into it and I'm trying. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  My husband is not into it but I am, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Flower gardening, vegetable gardening, anything you can plant?
L:  Flower -- flower gardening.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I work, um, I have a little one so I'm pretty well a stay at home mom but I've got, um, I work still where I worked full time before, at a wholesale grower.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  So that's a treat for me --
R:  And so you're able --
L:  -- 'cause that's my hobby, yes. [LAUGH]
R:  You're -- right.  So --
L:  So --
R:  -- you -- you actually work like, part time hours doing --
L:  I do.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I do.  Then barely at all, I only work on Saturdays --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- every other Saturday.  I bring home more plants than, uh, yeah.
R:  Right.
L:  Yes.
R:  Well that sounds like me, I used to be in gymnastics for about fifteen years --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and it was a real hobby for me.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And now that I have three little children I can't keep doing gymnastics --
L:  No.
R:  -- but I do teach gymnastics at the local Y. so that my daughters can be in the classes. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, that works perfect.
R:  But it's -- it's, you know, three hours a week. [LAUGH]
L:  Oh that's perfect.
R:  That's one of my hobbies, right.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Oh that's neat you're not -- you're -- did you -- how did you get into it?  Did you play -- I mean, did you -- gymnast- --
R:  I -- when I was three years old my mother put me in my first little tumbling class.
L:  Really?
R:  And I, um, I actually wound up reasonably good at it.  I was --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- uh, an elite gymnast in regional sort of --
L:  Oh wow.
R:  -- gymnastics meets and stuff and competed through high school and I was planning on going to college on a scholarship and I just, um, I had an injury in my senior year of gymnastics --
L:  [SIGH]
R:  -- it sorta put me out of business.  But --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- I still love it.  I love to do, you know, what I can still do at my age.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  But [LAUGH] --
L:  Do you --
R:  Which isn't nearly as much [LAUGH].
L:  Do the kids, um, enjoy it?
R:  They do.  I ha- --
L:  Okay.
R:  My five year old daughter is really into it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And, um, and my [MN] -- my two and a half year old, um, is, you know, at an age where it's --
L:  Right.
R:  -- mostly just fun to roll around on the mats and --
L:  Uh-huh, of course, yeah.
R:  But, y- yeah, they both -- they both enjoy it.  And they're -- they're strong little girls and so they --
L:  That's good.
R:  -- they could probably make something of it if they wanted to, eventually.  But we'll see --
L:  Oh, that's good.
R:  -- I'm not gonna push it on 'em! [LAUGH]
L:  My little one --
R:  Just 'cause it's my hobby doesn't mean I'll make it theirs. [LAUGH]
L:  I know, I know.  My little one loves to, um, work in the flowerbeds and stuff with me.
R:  Oh yeah?
L:  In fact we were laughing Mothers' Day, [LIPSMACK] he was so proud of what he picked out.
R:  Oh.
L:  And he came in and jumped in bed and said, "Mom, I have the most perfect present for you" opened it up, a packet of carrot seeds.
R:  Oh! [LAUGH]
L:  My husband looked at me, he goes, "I tried for three hours".
R:  It's a kind of flower, right?
L:  He said, "But Mom, this is all my mom needs, carrots".
R:  Right!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So he loves to ...
R:  Oh my goodness, that's fun.
L:  -- you know, be out there.  Or --
R:  Well, I try so hard.  We -- we built a home out in the country --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I actually enjoy being out in the garden and planting and stuff but I --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- um, we started with --
L:  It's hard with three kids.
R:  -- raw, red clay.
L:  Okay.
R:  And so it's taken us a while to get anything growing and, um --
L:  Mhm.  And you've got three kids.
R:  And I got three kids. [LAUGH]
L:  But -- and that's all you have to say.
R:  Who pull up all my tulips! [LAUGH]
L:  Yes. [LAUGH]  Yes, yes.  In the winter I don't garden obviously.
R:  Right.
L:  So, I used to --
R:  Do you have winter hobbies to take the place of it or ...?
L:  [SIGH] Not a lot.  I get -- I have plans for some --
R:  Really?
L:  -- of the spring.  I used to, um, do stained glass before --
R:  Oh really?
L:  -- Noah and I really enjoyed that.
R:  Wow.
L:  And I need to go back into doing that, that's what I would do during the winter.
R:  Right.
L:  But I'm -- for a while I was so nervous with all the glass and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- the shavings and the grinding around him, so I stopped doing it. But I think now --
R:  Wow, I can't imagine, that's quite an art.  I -- I don't know --
L:  I --
R:  I -- I have a lot of little hobbies but I don't have --
L:  Do you?
R:  -- anything I --
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  Well, I do a lot of scrapbooking and photography.
L:  Oh you do?
R:  And, um, so I -- I do, that's an easy one to do with kids because you've always got a subject to hand. [LAUGH]
L:  I just started --
R:  Really?
L:  -- doing photography.  Not scra- scrapbooking but photography, I finally got my first nice thirty five millimeter --
R:  Right.
L:  -- camera last year, and I love it.
R:  Well, I took a -- I took a photography class at the local community college.
L:  Right, uh-huh.
R:  And, um, learned a little bit about it, but really I have found that the best pictures I take are just when I just open up the camera and just snap a whole bunch.
L:  Yeah?
R:  I've won a couple of photography contests locally with it and, um --
L:  Did you?
R:  -- both times --
L:  Oh, that's exciting.
R:  -- I didn't have the right kind of film in my camera and I didn't have the -- I didn't manually set the camera or anything, I just -- I just had -- one time Jessica walked out 'cause my husband was building --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- a barn and he was out there dripping in sweat and all in his grubby clothes and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- she popped up on the ladder beside him to feed him some raspberries.
L:  Oh.
R:  And it was just this priceless contrast between this sweet little girl and this --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- drippy --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- ugly construction mess of a husband.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  And [LAUGH] -- and I went through almost a whole roll, just snapping as fast as I could --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- trying to capture what it was.  And I -- so I won on the state fair with a picture of them --
L:  Oh, that's exciting.
R:  -- and, um, and so yeah, that hobby's been fun.  But -- but learning more about it hasn't really done anything but frustrate me because I know I could take better pictures if I'd just slow down and do it. [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  I've been meaning -- I keep seeing at the community college little, um, you know, ble- -- classes on photography, 'cause I'd like to learn.
R:  It's -- well, it's a lotta fun.
L:  And I says, "Oh, I'd love --"  My husband studied --
R:  It's an expensive hobby. [LAUGH]
L:  -- photography, he -- we're both art student grads.
R:  Right.
L:  But, um, [NOISE] -- and he's very good.  And I keep saying, "Oh, I wanna learn".  He's like, "But, Kristin, you aren't gonna have a, you know, a developing room in the house, you're not gonna [inaudible] --"
R:  Right.  No, I don't do my own developing --
L:  Right.
R:  -- at all, so --
L:  Yeah.  He's, "The chemicals are too expensive and --" but I don't understand all the different apertures --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and all that.  I -- I don't --
R:  Right.
L:  I don't understand it yet.  So --
R:  Well, it's, um --
L:  Yes. 
R:  Yeah.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It -- it's -- it's definitely good information to have and I --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- d- -- I enjoy being able when I -- when I actually have the time to set up the right kind of shot and everything, I really enjoy --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- having that knowledge to pull on.  But --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- all of my really good pictures have just been --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- lucky with a good eye.
L:  Lucky shot.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, Virginia's --
R:  So --
L:  -- beautiful.  I've got family --
R:  Virginia is beautiful.
L:  -- in, uh, Midlothian?
R:  Oh, that's where my husband works.
L:  Oh!
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's wonderful out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I was just out there last year, it was beautiful.
R:  [NOISE] Well --
L:  Beautiful.
R:  Travel is a hobby then, right? [LAUGH]
L:  Mhm.  [LAUGH]  I loved all your plants.  I'm like, "Oh, my goodness" and --
R:  Right.  It's so -- I lived in Utah for four years.
L:  Mhm.
R:  In fact, we're about ready to do a big road trip out there, [inaudible] travel and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I found the whole time I was in Utah I missed the green --
L:  Oh, see --
R:  -- from back home.
L:  I wasn't --
R:  But now that I'm in Virginia I miss the rock and the landscape and the mountains and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- you know, so I just need to find a place with both.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  The best of both worlds.  Cut out the middle of the continent and meld them right together! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I agree, I agree.  Here it's just flat.
R:  Chicago, yeah.
L:  Flat.  That's it.  Nothing, flat.
R:  Huh.
L:  It's horrid.  Why people live here I don't know. [LAUGH]
R:  Work? [LAUGH]
L:  But I've grown up here.  [LAUGH]  I've grown up here.  Work --
R:  Really?
L:  -- that's it, that's the only reason, work.
R:  Oh.
L:  So --
R:  I don't know -- I -- I -- I think Virginia would be very high on my list to choose for places --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to live.  And, um, partly just because it's [MN] -- I'm an outdoors person, you know --
L:  I was just gonna say.
R:  -- I love doing outdoor things.  I love hiking and camping --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and boating and -- and we're close to the beach and we're close to the mountains -- or at least not the real mountains but --
L:  Right.
R:  -- you know, the hills.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And [LAUGH] -- and -- and so I'm able to -- a lot of those --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- they're not hobbies that take up much of my time but they're certainly things I enjoy doing.  I'm able to do them here and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- still be close to both my family and my husband's, so --
L:  Mhm.  Yeah, I know, it's -- yeah, it was nice when I was out there.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So --
R:  Huh.
L:  Otherwise I don't really have any other hobbies, just --
R:  Just gardening.
L:  Yeah, in fact I was planting today.  We have a newer home we just built two years ago, so --
R:  We built four years ago.
L:  Okay, then you know, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  Right.
L:  So this year we, um, I started opening up the beds and planting, so --
R:  Right.
L:  -- it's kinda exciting.
R:  Yeah, I bet.
L:  I --
R:  I wish I knew what I was doing because --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- my mother keeps giving me slips of everything, you know?
L:  Oh, does she?
R:  "Here, put this -- here, put this -- here, put".
L:  Oh, well that's good.
R:  I actually planted a magnolia tree two fee away from my foundation.
L:  Oh! [LAUGH]
R:  And then after a year I'm like, "You know, this isn't looking like a shrubbery, this is looking --"
L:  Yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  And Mom's like, "Oh, that was a magnolia tree, honey, you need to move that". [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Those are the best though, when you get --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- starts from other people and things.
R:  Right.
L:  But, yeah. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] But obviously I'm really clued into what I do. [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] My mother, uh, [MN] she's like, "Come weed my beds, come out in my garden --"
R:  [NOISE]
L:  "-- and I will clean your inside" and we both laugh because, you know, I'd rather be outside and I think I have the best end of the deal, and she'd rather be in mopping floors and dusting.
R:  Oh, I -- no, housework is definitely the furthest thing from a hobby.
L:  Agreed.
R:  Ugh.
L:  Agreed.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I agree.
R:  [NOISE]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [NOISE]
L:  I can hear your kids, yeah.
R:  Yes, they're just trying to find an afternoon show on right now.
L:  Yes.  That's what I did, I put a TV show and thought, "Oh, I'll come up here and make a call and see".
R:  [NOISE]
L:  So ...  Um [SIGH] --
R:  Well --
L:  That's it for my hobbies.
R:  I know.  That's -- well, let's see, they asked the question --
L:  Yeah.
R:  "How important is it, do you think, for people to have hobbies?"
L:  Oh yeah.  I think it's -- I think it's good to find -- I mean, I think it's important to find something you love.
R:  Right.
L:  You know.  I don't think it's a necessity, I think you can have a million things you like to do, as long as you aren't just stagnant --
R:  Right.
L:  -- does that make sense?  But I think it -- it's good like if once you're retired and --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- stuff or --
R:  Right. [NOISE]
L:  Or just to have your own thing that, you know, you're --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're good at or you like, you know.
R:  Well, I think it gives people a sense of accomplishment and a sense of pride and [NOISE] --
L:  Yep, I think so.
R:  I've, um, you know, our church really fosters that a lot, we, um [NOISE] --
L:  Mhm.
R:  Like, I'm teaching a photography class next month to a bunch of ladies from my church.
L:  Oh, how perfect.
R:  And it's just --
L:  I volunteer a lot at church.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, my church.
R:  We --
L:  But that's nice you're doing that.
R:  Yeah.  And so every month they have like a -- an evening that is, [MN] you know, it's
