L:  Hello.
R:  Hello.
L:  Hi, I'm Hilary.
R:  I'm Joan.  Um, do you want to --
L:  Have you --
R:  -- start or ...?
L:  I -- it doesn't matter to me.  Have you done one before?
R:  I've done one yesterday.
L:  Okay, yeah.  I've only done one also.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So, um, well, I -- I guess I can tell you what my hobbies are.  Um, I play softball.  I bowl on a league.  I'm a Mary Kay consultant which really shouldn't be a hobby, it should be more of a career, I guess.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I like to go out dancing.  And I like spending time with my dog.  I have some others but, I mean, prob- -- those are probably the ones I spend the most time doing.
R:  Mhm.  Well, mainly mine is refunding.  Do you know anything about refunding?
L:  No.
R:  No?  Uh, well, it -- it has a lot to do with coupons and --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- rebate forms and things like that.  Uh, in fact that's how I came to do this is, uh, through that.  Um --
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah, I try to spend a couple hours at least each night, um, on the computer doing that.  Um, other than that I have my, uh, children and my grandchildren.  [LAUGH]  Those are mainly my hobbies at, uh -- I think you're younger than I am.  I'm sixty six.  [MN]
L:  Oh, I'm -- I'm twenty seven so ...
R:  So there's a big [LAUGH] difference.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Um, my daughters, both of 'em, played softball.  They enjoyed it very much.  Um, [LIPSMACK] the other [MN] --
L:  I ju- -- I play in a city league now so it's no big deal --
R:  City league?
L:  -- but ...
R:  Well, there's was mainly, uh, school and then --
L:  Right, that's -- I did play in school but ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Did -- did they play for college?
R:  No.  No.  They just played for high school.  
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  [MN]  Yeah, they started at a young age.  Like in the elementary and [several inaudible words] until they graduated and they played, like, one year after they graduated on the -- on another team.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  But, um, now they're married and they -- they don't do that anymore.  [LAUGH]  Um --
L:  All right.
R:  [MN]  So what did you say your other hobbies are?
L:  Um, I bowl on a league.  
R:  Oh, I used to do that too.  I liked --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- that a lot.
L:  Yeah.  I -- I have a lot of fun doing it but, um, I think I might -- I'm gonna have to sit out a season 'cause I have -- I'm doing too much at night and it's costing too much money.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I need to --
R:  Well I used --
L:  [several inaudible words] out. 
R:  -- to mine in -- in the morning.  Of course, my youngest daughter used to bowl and -- and I'd go and keep score for her.  But, um, I -- I did my bowling in the morning and, uh, it was just, uh, a mix of younger and older women.  And it was real nice.  
L:  [NOISE]
R:  But then I moved so I can't do that anymore.
L:  Wh- where do you live now?
R:  I live in Pennsylvania.
L:  Okay.  I live in Texas.  So ...
R:  Oh.  And do you have a lot of leagues out there for -- for bowling?  Is it real popular?
L:  Um, I -- I don't really know.  I -- I don't have anything to compare it [LAUGH] to so ...
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  I don't -- I don't know how popular it is.  
R:  Well --
L:  Um, I mean, there's -- there's two leagues a night.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But at the lane at -- or the -- the alley that I bowl at.  Um, [MN] and -- and they have 'em I think -- well, they have 'em just about every day of the week.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But, um ...
R:  [MN]  It was quite popular whenever, uh -- whenever I used to bowl and [MN] --
L:  Well, I think it's actually regaining some popularity.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  So ...  It's -- it's like cool for college kids to be on a league now it seems like.  
R:  Oh, I have -- I have a couple of, uh, grandchildren in college.  One just +started -- well, she finished her first year.  And the other one just finished his, uh, uh, third year.  So ...
L:  What are the other topics we're supposed to talk about I think?  If --
R:  Well they wanted to know about how much time you spent [COUGH] on your hobbies.  And, um --
L:  Well, I'll give you an [LAUGH] example.  Uh, when I was playing softball and doing Mary Kay and doing, um, bowling, which I'm still doing the Mary Kay.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But softball season is over and I'm sitting out a season.  The same with bowling, I'm sitting out a season.  But I was doing softball on Monday nights.  Mary Kay, Tuesday nights.  Bowling on Thursday nights.  Wednesday was date night.  [LAUGH]  And then I have Thursday night after bowling, and then Friday and Saturday I would go out dancing.
R:  Are you in college?
L:  No.  
R:  No?
L:  No, I'm not.  I -- I graduated from Texas [inaudible] in two thousand and one.
R:  Mhm.  Well you --
L:  And --
R:  -- keep yourself quite busy [LAUGH] don't you?
L:  Yes, I [LAUGH] do.  
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I don't like to sit at home.  And I have a lot of friends that like to -- to go out and do stuff so ...
R:  Well, that's nice.  Um --
L:  What about you?
R:  I live -- I live on a farm so, I'm ki- -- 
L:  Oh, [MN].
R:  -- out in the -- out in the country and I don't really get out too much.  Um, I guess mainly that's why I like my refunding.  It's something that I can do to keep myself occupied at home, you know.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, my -- my boyfriend actually lives on a farm.  Um, and I -- I spend -- I've started spending time out there --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- um, on the weekends.  But -- I mean, he's -- he's younger than I am.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Quite a bit [LAUGH] younger actually.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  He's twenty one which is very young for me to be dating, but he's very mature for his age so ...
R:  Well --
L:  But --
R:  Age I don't think really counts sometimes.  I think --
L:  Sometimes --
R:  -- it's the people.
L:  Yeah.  Exactly.  
R:  I know, um --
L:  But ...
R:  -- my youngest son married a lady that's older than him.  And, uh, believe me [LAUGH] they're -- they're having their first baby in another month.
L:  Oh, wow.
R:  And she -- she's forty five.  And -- and he's, uh, thirty eight.
L:  She's forty five and she -- and they're having their first baby?
R:  Yes.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Wow.  Are they not concerned about, uh, problems?  I mean, did she -- I'm assuming she got an amniocentesis?
R:  Um, yeah.  Well, she was a v- -- the doctor said -- said she was quite healthy 'cause she's quite active.  You know.  Um, [MN] as she grooms dogs and so she's -- she does lifting and -- and things like that a lot.  So they said she was -- she was healthy and she could go ahead and have one so ...  They are.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, that's good.  
R:  Yeah.  
L:  And how many other children do you have?
R:  I have five children altogether.  I have --
L:  Wow.
R:  And three grandchildren.  And this will be my fourth.  So they take up quite a bit of time.  
L:  I'm sure they do.
R:  [LAUGH]  Yeah.  And how many -- do you have children?
L:  No.  
R:  Oh.
L:  No, I've -- I've -- I'm married and divorced but I -- I had no kids.  My dog is my child.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  [LAUGH] 
L:  And she's treated like one.  She sleeps on my bed with me and I try to take her out in my car with me as much as possible.
R:  Mhm.  I have two Dachshunds.
L:  Cute.  Are they related or ...?
R:  No.  No.  They're [MN] -- one -- my daughter was raising dogs and, uh, uh, the one is, uh, from her litter.  Her dog's litter.
L:  Mm.
R:  And another one, uh, belonged to my son.  He had bought that at [MN] one of the pet stores.  
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah, so ...  And we have a lot of cats.  [LAUGH]  Too many --
L:  How many cats?
R:  [LAUGH]  Huh?
L:  You have --
R:  How many?
L:  -- a lot of cats?  
R:  Yeah.  Right now I have about five, um, adults and four babies.  They just keep on multiplying here.  And --
L:  Yeah, that -- that seems to happen.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.  
L:  Well --
R:  Well, you -- you know, you just find different people that want them and -- and, uh, they take care of 'em and -- otherwise I have to watch because the animals, uh -- we have fox around here and you have the --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- uh, ground hog and, uh, we were raising, uh, [MN] geese and ducks but the ground hogs killed 'em all off so ...  So that was that.  
L:  So it sounds like your farm is a hobby that takes up a lot of time too.
R:  Uh, yes.  It does.  [LAUGH]  It takes quite a bit of time.  You know.  And as you get the different animals and -- we had cows too.  We raised cows for a while.  And, um, that takes a lot of time and then we -- then you have to butcher them, you know.  And, uh --
L:  Right.
R:  Uh ...
L:  But that's nice because you get, you know, fresh meat.
R:  Yes.  Uh-huh.  But the grandchildren wanted to make pets out of 'em, you know.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  They'd give 'em names and things and it's kind of hard to go and kill [LAUGH] them.  They don't want to eat the meat.  [LAUGH]  So ...
L:  Exactly.  
R:  [MN]  So you said --
L:  Well --
R:  -- you go dancing?
L:  Yes.  Mainly country dancing, like two step.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  Or -- or three step.  Um, that's mainly what I do.  I mean, it's a -- there's one main bar that I go to and that's -- it's predominantly country dancing.  No line dancing.  We don't do that [LAUGH] anymore.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  That's very eighties.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, but we, uh -- they do play, you know, some kind of hip hop and -- and, you know, pop type music and dance
