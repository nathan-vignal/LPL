R:  Good.  How ya doing?
L:  I'm good.
R:  So, uh, my name's Ellen.
L:  Okay.  My name is April.
R:  Oh, nice to meet you.  [LAUGH]
L:  You too.
R:  [SIGH] So, um [LIPSMACK], have you done this before?
L:  I have not.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, I don't -- there was this -- I don't know -- a friend just told me to try it out.  So, I said [NOISE] why not?
R:  Yeah.  Same here.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] You know?  But, hey, you get to [several inaudible words].
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, that's [inaudible].
R:  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.  So, I guess we're supposed to be talking hobbies?
R:  Sure.  Um [MN], um, do you have any hobbies?  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um, I have -- yeah, I have some hobbies.  Um, what about you, what do you like to do?
R:  Oh, I -- I enjoy music, um, I like to listen to music, um, I used to like to, um, you know, write poems and songs and stuff and that's pretty much about it right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  Do you still write poems or ...?
R:  Um, not as much as I'd like to.  I don't have time.  I work fulltime and I have kids now.  So [LAUGH] --
L:  [LAUGH] Yep.
R:  -- hobbies kinda went.
L:  That makes it hard.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um [LIPSMACK], well, like, uh, were you -- what type of music do you listen to?
R:  Right now, um, just -- you know, I just turn on the radio and, you know, um ...
L:  Kinda like whatever.
R:  Kinda whatever.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Um, I have a friend who's a D.J. and he makes me, um [LIPSMACK], tapes and -- or CDs I should say and he tells me what -- what's good.  [LAUGH]
L:  Is he a, um -- is he just like a regular -- is he a, um, radio D. J. or is he like a ...?
R:  No.  He, um -- 
L:  Does parties?
R:  -- he does like parties and stuff.
L:  Okay.  That sounds cool.
R:  Yeah.  He has a good time and, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and that he makes us good, um [LIPSMACK] -- good, uh, CDs.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] That's fun.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's cool that you get free music from that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Um, well, I -- I like music [LAUGH], you know --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- um, that's probably one of my vanities I guess, to keep me from going insane, you know, um, and I pretty much like all kinds of music.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  So, you know?  Um [LIPSMACK], what else do I like to do?  Um ...
R:  Um, movies?
L:  I like movies.  Yes, movies are good.
R:  Yep.
L:  Um, but movies have got, um, like so expensive now.
R:  Yeah.  Yep.  I, um -- I've been getting movies mostly now from Net Flicks.  They come to the house and I watch 'em and then I send them back.
L:  Oh, really?
R:  Yeah.  You don't have to pay late fees.  So --
L:  Oh, okay.  It's ...
R:  -- I can keep 'em as long as I want.
L:  Is it like new movies or ...?
R:  Yep.  It can be anything, um, they have a pretty big library of movies and, um, you pay like twenty bucks a month and you can keep three movies out at a time as long as you want.  I mean, it's best to watch 'em and send them and keep getting more --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- but -- but if you feel like keeping it for a while and, um, you know, you just would have, you know, less movies coming and going 'cause you'd be keeping that one.  But at least you're not paying any late fees on it or anything like that.
L:  Well, that's cool.  I might have to try that.
R:  Yeah.  It's, um, Net Flicks dot com.
L:  Okay.
R:  Yeah.
L:  How did you find out about it?
R:  Um, actually my friend who's a D.J.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah, he keeps me current --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- 'cause he likes movies too and, um [LIPSMACK], you know, we -- we used to spend a lotta money just going to the movies and hanging out and -- and like you said it gets very expensive.  So ...
L:  Oh, yeah, it does --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause I'm -- I mean, I'm a college student.  So --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- um, it's just too difficult to try and pay --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- for movies.
R:  Unless you hit like a matinee or something.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So ...
L:  Luckily I had a friend who -- who works for this, um, entertainment firm.
R:  [MN]
L:  She was interning there --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- and she got to do like free movies and stuff.
R:  Ah.
L:  So, um, I got to see like all the big movies --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- for free --
R:  Yeah, well, that's good.
L:  -- which saved me --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- which saved me a lotta money.
R:  Definitely, yeah.  [LAUGH]  Definitely it would, yeah.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  So, that's cool.  That sounds like fun.
L:  Yeah.  'Cause otherwise -- I mean, the only ones we didn't get to see were like, um, The Matrix --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and, I mean, obviously 'cause --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they were real strict about letting --
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  -- the public in.
R:  Of course, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  So [LIPSMACK], yeah.
R:  I'll have a little while on that one I guess.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [NOISE]  So, um -- so, I -- I mean, I'm not a big sci-fi person.  So, it didn't really bother me.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um, I can wait to see it.
L:  Yes.
R:  I can wait.  I mean, I actually wanna see it 'cause, you know --
L:  [NOISE]
R:  -- I'm sure it's a pretty cool movie and the first one was good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  But, um ...
L:  I haven't even seen -- like, I've seen bits and pieces of the first one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I mean, you know, I just kept -- and then everybody else kept doing ...
R:  Oh, yeah.  All -- all the movies spoof it, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  So, we're like okay, well, I guess I've seen it then.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  What is the point?
R:  It's just cute.  I mean, it's -- it's -- it's worth seeing.  I mean, not for ten bucks, but ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  Yeah.  Um, but we'll see, I guess, you know, if I'm convinced.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  If somebody wanted to pay for me to see it that's different.  [NOISE]
R:  Yep.
L:  But --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- I can't pay to see it.
R:  No.  I don't blame ya.  I'm -- I'm waiting 'til, um, it's out on, uh, D.V.D.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Or cable even.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly, H.B.O. or something.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not gonna --
L:  Anything. 
R:  -- pay extra for it.  Yeah.  I'm -- I'm not that into science fiction, um ...
L:  Yeah, me neither.  Like I just don't see the -- I don't know the point of it.
R:  Yep, I agree.
L:  Like people I've heard they're like "Yeah, you've gotta see The Matrix".  I'm like okay.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  You see The Matrix and I'll say yes.  So ...
R:  What kinda movies do you like best?
L:  Um [PAUSE], what do I like?  Um, let's see.  It will probably be like comedies --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- action, comedies.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Anything that's like, um [PAUSE] -- anything that's gonna, you know, like, um, make me laugh.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  So, I'm like waiting for the new Jim Carrey movie.
R:  Oh, yeah, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- Bruce Almighty.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  I wanna see that.
L:  'Cause I wanna see it.  I think it's coming out in this next week.
R:  Soon.  Soon, yeah, very, very soon.  Yeah, I wanna see that.
L:  Yeah, 'cause I -- it's about [several inaudible words] like doing these --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- random movies that he's trying to actually be an actor.
R:  Right.
L:  You might as well go and be a comedian --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- is what we expect you to do.
R:  Yeah.  Be a goofball yourself.  [LAUGH]
L:  Exactly.  So, I'm looking forward to that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  [NOISE] Um, there's this other movie and I think it's just gonna be a sleeper, but it's on the Italian Mob.
R:  Yeah.  That looks good.  I've been seeing the, um [LIPSMACK] -- the promos for that.
L:  Yeah.  I don't know if it's out yet or not, but ...
R:  It'll be soon.  Soon.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, well, I -- I like, um, Edward Norton.
L:  Yeah.  He's ...
R:  He's usually pretty good.
L:  Yeah, he is.  I like him.  Um, so I'm waiting on that to come out if it hasn't already come out --
R:  Soon I think.
L:  -- and, um, I mean, like they have so much coming out this summer.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, too much, um, a lotta junk, like Charlie's Angels --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's gonna be out and, uh, um [LIPSMACK], Legally Blonde Two.  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't -- yeah, like I don't know if it's necessary to have a two.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.
L:  I don't know.  Like, there was barely enough --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to make a one.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, trying to soak up all the money they can on that.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It'll probably do well.
R:  Yeah.  It'll be all right, but I'm not rushing out to see that one.
L:  Yeah, um ...  So, yeah, and I don't know why everybody's --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- like so excited about the Terminator.  Ah, that's not me.
R:  Yeah.  No.  I could do without that too.
L:  So, there's that.  Well, okay, Terminator.  Ah, yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] I don't know how they're gonna do 'cause, you know, I mean, it ...
L:  You've seen -- you've seen one you've seen them all.
R:  And plus, I mean, I don't remember how it all ended, but [LAUGH] I don't think there was anything left for them to do.
L:  Exactly.  So, there's no point in trying to continue to bring that out.  I really thought that it was coming out next summer --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- for some reason.
R:  Oh.
L:  But I guess I was thinking of ...
R:  They're showing the ads for it.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's coming soon.
L:  I guess I was wrong.  So, that's, um [LIPSMACK], another movie for Arnold.
R:  Yeah, and they're talking about doing another Indiana Jones.  [LAUGH]
L:  There's no need for that.  I don't know.  Will that be like the fourth one?
R:  Yeah, the, um -- be the fourth one.
L:  [NOISE] Oh, gosh!
R:  Harrison Ford is like sixty now.  So, that'll be kinda interesting [LAUGH] if he ca- came back.
L:  I'm like oh, my gosh!
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I think that probably -- he would probab- -- like I think he's better off in doing the movies like where -- what was that movie he did?  [LIPSMACK] Um, like something like, um -- what is the last movie he did?
R:  I don't know.  [LAUGH]
L:  I can't remember.  But, you know, like though where -- like something like Air Force One or something like that.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Like, I find him better in those kinda movies than trying to be an action hero --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- 'cause, you know, he's getting up there.  I wouldn't want him to hurt himself.
R:  That's true, yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Everybody -- I understand Sean Connery.  Everybody wants to be Sean Connery.
R:  Oh, yeah.  That's true.
L:  But he was a Bond.  So ...
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah, I don't know if they need more Bond movies, but I don't think anybody cares anyway.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, right.
R:  Kinda died out.
L:  Yeah.  Die another day.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  I think it already died.
R:  Yep.
L:  So, um, I guess what other hobbies do you have?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, let's see.  Um [SIGH], I don't know.
L:  [NOISE]
R:  I love animals, um [LAUGH], take care of them I guess.  It's not so much a hobby, but a -- I don't know.
L:  Yeah, that's like you gotta do it.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  I mean, they're staring at me right now.  So ...  [LAUGH]
