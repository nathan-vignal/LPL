L:  Hello?
R:  Hello.  
L:  Hi, I'm Cara.
R:  I'm Shirley.
L:  Hi, nice to meet you.
R:  Nice to meet you too.
L:  So what are your hobbies?
R:  Oh, I was thinking about that.  I heard what the topic of the day was and I was thinking --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I've got a lot [MN] -- a lot of [LAUGH] hobbies.  [MN]
L:  Do --
R:  I -- I -- you know, I like to garden, and that's big this time of the year.
L:  Oh, yeah.  I do too.  And do you scrapbook?
R:  No, I don't scrapbook.
L:  You don't scrapbook.  I never --
R:  A lot of people I know scrapbook and I just haven't gotten into it.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh, yeah.  That is the big thing these days.  
R:  Mhm.  Is that one of your favorites?
L:  Yes, it is.  I spend a lot of time doing it too.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Well, how much time you think you spend on that?
L:  +Well, I -- I at least go -- I probably spend -- I don't know.  Um, let's [LAUGH] see.  Probably, like, I don't -- ten, fifteen hours a month.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Which I guess it doesn't sound like a lot when you phrase it that way but it is because there's more in a condensed time --  
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- period.  What about you for gardening?  How much time do you spend doing that?
R:  Oh, [COUGH] so far not much because it's been raining and we just got our garden tilled yesterday but, um, probably most -- I'm out there most days for an hour or two, I suppose.  Course those days you can't -- you can't -- always gets ahead of me.  I have two great big [LAUGH] gardens.  And so I never can keep the weeds down satisfactorily but I always [LAUGH] try.  
L:  [LAUGH]  Oh, yeah.  Uh --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- do you -- is it a vegetable garden?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Oh, okay.  So what --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- all do you have in your garden?
R:  Well, [MN] I'm big on vine crops.  [MN] I don't know why because I don't like to eat them that well, but I like to plant lots of squash and pumpkins and -- though I do love cucumbers.  I plant a lot of those.  And always tomatoes.  I always plant so much stuff, and even though the weeds eventually take it all over we have so much harvest [LAUGH] we have to give it away but ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  [MN]  We plant rows and row and rows of sweetcorn but that's summer.  We have a garden up towards the house and it's real big but we have a lot bigger one out in the -- well, we call it our pasture.  We don't have any animals in it but ...
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  It's got a fence and ...
L:  But a field.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Right.  
L:  Well, and so what part of the country are you from?
R: Um, western Pennsylvania.  
L:  Oh, okay.  
R:  Where are you from?
L:  Uh, I'm in south Texas.
R:  Oh.  You don't have that much of an accent for --
L:  Oh, [MN]
R:  -- a [LAUGH] southerner.
L:  Oh, well good.  [LAUGH]  I'm glad to hear that.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I thought maybe you were a little --
L:  Southern?
R:  Yeah, but it seems like people down that far usually have a -- a -- quite a drawl.  [LAUGH] 
L:  Oh.  [LAUGH]  Maybe I work on it.  Do you play the piano or anything like that?
R:  Oh, I played the piano -- you know, took lessons when I was a child but I certainly wasn't a natural so it came so hard to me.  
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  But I took it, like, lessons, like, for three years but I never did do much with that.  I mean, [MN] I practised.  My mom did make me practice every day and I did it dutiful, but [SIGH] I guess I'm better for the experience.  Do you play?
L:  [MN]  No.  I don't.  I -- I wish.  Um, that's something that I've -- I actually would like to take up but I think it'd be harder to learn as an adult than it would be
R:  [MN]
L:  -- as a child.  
R:  I think it depends if you're musical or not.  I don't --
L:  Well ...
R:  -- think I was.  My sister took off [MN] -- uh, she took piano lessons the same length of time I did and she's a really good piano [LAUGH] player.
L:  Oh.  So you don't miss it or anything, I presume?
R:  No.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  I think it's good to learn, then if you want to sit down and pick something out or something, you know.
L:  [MN]  Right.
R:  It's -- I don't think you'd go wrong.  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  No.
R:  But ...  [MN]  So what --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- are your other hobbies?
L:  Uh, well, ac- -- gardening, um, but I don't do a vegetable garden.  I have a -- um, huge, um, flower beds. 
R:  Mm.
L:  With all sorts of flowers in 'em and [MN] so we've kind of been experimenting with some different type of flowers and what grows well, and things like that.  So I enjoy that just because I can see the, um, I can watch it grow over time.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, I'd love to try the try, uh, tomato plants and, uh, cucumbers and things like that.  And I bought some and I never did plant 'em, and they died before I could even get 'em in the ground.
R:  Hm.
L:  So I just kind of procrastinated.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, not hard to grow.  
L:  But, um, does your husband do this with you?
R:  [MN]  Well, he helps me out where manpower is needed.  [LAUGH]  Like --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- the rototiller breaks down, he'll fix it and stuff like that.  But he doesn't do very much in the vegetable garden.  He did plant the corn yesterday.  We got one of those planters where you load the seed in a little hopper and then you just push.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  All the -- it's so much faster than trying to seed it by hand.
L:  Oh, I bet.  
R:  Anyway he got -- he's -- didn't use to plant anything but ever since we [LAUGH] got -- got that thing --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- he would --
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  -- plants the corn.  Seems to like to do it.
L:  He took more interest in it.  [LAUGH] 
R:  And he does the, believe it or not, he does our flowers.  We don't have that many but he did build a nice flowerbed and he works on that.
L:  Oh, well, that's good.  I always think it's neat to ha- -- husband and wife to have hobbies together.  
R:  Mhm. 
L:  But ...
R:  Mm, we don't have much other same interests here though.
L:  [LAUGH]  We don't either.  [LAUGH] 
R:  [LAUGH]  Do you crochet or anything like that?  Knit?
L:  No.  I wanted to try to take up sewing.  A friend of mine --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- took a sewing class and she makes these really neat purses.
R:  Oh.
L:  And so I wanted to try to pick up sewing to do that and try to make a little extra money so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um, but I have all these ideas of things that I'd like to do, but I never get around to doing it.
R:  Mhm.  I can sew but it always costs me money [LAUGH] [several inaudible words].
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Uh, really bad about buying the materials and everything I need to get a project going, and then sitting in the box for years.
L:  We- well, it's -- it's just hard.  Time gets away from ya.  
R:  I was in -- I was taking up smocking.  You know what that is?
L:  No.  What's smocking?
R:  Well, some of the really fancy childrens' outfits have smocking on 'em.  It's like when the material's gathered and then there's, like, embroidery.  It's not all embroidery, but that sort of thing across [MN] -- across it.  Some really cute outfits are done that way. 
L:  Oh.  
R:  And, anyway I -- [several inaudible words] fabrics you probably can see, if you ever go in there, a magazine called Sew Beautiful.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  And that's just full of that sort of thing.  And Creative Needle is too, I think.
L:  Oh.
R:  [several inaudible words] Sew Beautiful but I never -- well I did smock one dress I guess.  But anyway I bought the pleater and all that stuff.  [LAUGH]  All expensive and I got a --
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  -- [LAUGH] a subscription to this magazine.  Come from Australia, and anyway, I'm -- I'm pretty frugal, uh, you know, over all.  Not with the [MN] sew -- I sort of gave up the sewing thing 'cause I keep doing that [MN] with little kids, and [MN] I think I will [LAUGH] when they, uh, you know, don't get into my stuff and ...  [LAUGH]  
L:  Yeah.  Well, it's -- it's hard.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  I mean, it seems like if you want to get into anything it costs you money to get into it.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And so that's the, I think, the hardest thing.  
R:  [MN]  So you think there's, I don't know, there's people out there with no hobbies?  They mentioned that, uh, in the introductory thing.  I -- I would think everybody should need a [LAUGH] hobby.  I don't know of anybody, probably, that doesn't have something they're interested in.  [MN]
L:  Well, y- you know, I was kind of the -- I was kind of that way before I picked up scrapbooking.  
R:  Mm.
L:  Is -- I really didn't have anything I was -- that I did too much and it seemed like once I started being creative in one way that --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it kind of opened up my -- my creativity.  
R:  Mm.
L:  If that makes any sense?  I don't know why but it seemed like after I started scrapbooking I started doing all these other things and I was started getting interested in sewing or, um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- gardening.  And I don't know if it's just because I saw the effects of what I did.  
R:  Mm.
L:  And so it kind of caused me to want to pick up other things.  I don't know.  
R:  That could be.
L:  Or maybe-- well, I picked up scrapbooking after I became a mom so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  I don't know.  It's just weird because before then, I guess, I was one of those that I could've said that, "No, I don't have any hobbies".  
R:  Oh.
L:  I always thought it was embarrassing too, because everyone has hobbies.  And I was like, "I can't think of anything".  [MN]
