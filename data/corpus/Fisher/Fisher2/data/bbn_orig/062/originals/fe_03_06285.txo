R:  Hi, my name is Geraldine.
L:  Hi, my name is Anne.
R:  Hi.  Uh, how are you doing?
L:  Good.  How are you?
R:  Great.  Uh, uh, what is the -- the question is, what would be my favorite hobby?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Um, I guess, um, I really enjoy water sports.  So, I would say kayaking is my favorite sport.  [LAUGH]  How 'bout you?
L:  Um, probably bowling.
R:  Bowling.  Oh, wow!
L:  Yeah, I like bowling.
R:  That's a different one.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Where -- where are you at right now just to get a -- a sense of why bowling would be a -- a favorite hobby?  [LAUGH]
L:  [NOISE] Um ...
R:  Just a second.  I'm just gonna ...  [NOISE]
L:  Excuse me?
R:  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  It's just somebody was asking me a quick question and I -- I needed to get some change back.
L:  Oh.
R:  Thank you.  I'll all set.  What -- what was your answer?
L:  I'm sorry.  What did you say?
R:  I asked, um, where -- where -- where you're whereabouts?  What are your whereabouts just to, um, put in perspective your -- your choice of a hobby?
L:  Oh, um, well, I'm in Florida.
R:  Oh, so am I.  That's interesting.
L:  Are you?  [LAUGH]
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Right in Fort Lauderdale of all places.
L:  [LAUGH] I'm in [inaudible] County.
R:  [PAUSE] And, um, have you been, uh, bowling for a long time or is that something that ...?
L:  No, not really.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  I just -- I work and I go to school and I have a little girl.  I don't have a whole lotta time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It's about all I can really find time for right now.
R:  No, that sounds like a nice --
L:  That's what I do to get outta the house.
R:  -- relaxing ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  No.  It sounds like a nice relaxing thing to do especially if you have family it's perfect, you know?  I'm sure --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- she gets involved as well.
L:  Yes.
R:  And what, um -- that's -- that's, uh -- how did you learn about this particular -- this, uh, research program?
L:  [NOISE] Um, my Mom actually, she found it on the computer.  So ...
R:  Ah, interesting.  So, uh, yeah, I -- a friend of mine told me about it through, um, a website and it's actually quite popular in the New England area.
L:  Oh, is it?
R:  I just moved from there and, uh, yeah, they, um -- it's -- it's called Craig's List --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and through there somebody was advertising it and it sounded kind of interesting.  Actually at the beginning I was a little bit skeptical because I -- you know, there's so many fishy things going on over the Internet these days --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- that I was like what?
L:  You never know what's ...
R:  Yeah, exactly.  So, I wasn't totally -- you know, I wasn't, uh -- I wasn't totally comfortable with the concept.  But, you know, once I -- you just do a little bit of research and -- and you ask them some, you know, specific questions and, you know, they were very forward about -- you know, they came forward with all the -- the details. 
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, it sounded legitimate --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and, um -- and, well, um, you know, it, um -- it -- how old is your little girl?
L:  [NOISE] Sixteen months.
R:  Oh, my gosh!  She's a little baby.
L:  Yeah, only a little one.
R:  So, that is your hobby right now.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yes, she is.  [LAUGH]
R:  Sounds like a fulltime job.
L:  She's a lotta fun.
R:  So, I'm sure she's your hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  She is.
R:  That's really cute.  Wow!  What's her name?  I mean, I'm asking you silly questions don't -- if you -- if there's anything you don't wanna answer feel free, don't worry about it.
L:  Oh, that's fine.  Her name is Gwenda.
R:  Oh, Gwenda.  Oh, that's really sweet.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And, um, is there anything that you wanna add or, you know, I mean, I -- I guess we just have to kill ten minutes somehow.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH] Um [PAUSE], do you have kids?
R:  No.
L:  No.
R:  I don't have any kids, but I -- you know, I definitely wish I had.  I'm in my mid thirties and, uh, it's not something that was at -- at the top of my list.  It's just, uh, I think with time, uh -- and I'm not -- you know, I'm -- I'm not, um, necessarily like hunting for that experience.  It's just that, you know, with time you start realizing that it is, um -- it's a very precious thing and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- you know, that you do wish to have them but, um, you know, you just have to take life however it's presented to you and live it -- live it that way and -- and not, you know --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- don't go beyond that 'cause otherwise you will be discontent --
L:  Yep.
R:  -- with the outcome.  But, um -- but, yeah, I think I would have loved to, uh -- my sisters' had boys and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- I would've been very happy if, uh, somebody in the family would've had a girl.  So, they're all looking at me like --
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  -- like well, you're it, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  But somehow I'm gonna have to come up with it.  Did you, um ...?
L:  They are definitely lots of fun.
R:  Yeah, I know.
L:  I'm ready for more.  [LAUGH]
R:  It sounds -- is -- is this your first child?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Oh, that's nice.
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's really nice.
L:  That's why I'd like a couple more.
R:  And you're managing?  You have a child and go to school as well?
L:  Mhm.
R:  Wow!
L:  I'm going for nursing.
R:  For -- for what, nursing?
L:  Nursing.  Mhm.
R:  Oh, that's nice.  That's very good.  I had a lotta friends in -- in the -- you know, in Boston when -- where I lived there were -- that -- that worked there.  It's a -- it's a very rewarding job.  It's a little bit intense.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So, I'm sure you know what you're getting into. 
L:  Yeah.
R:  But it's very rewarding and ...
L:  I work as a C.N.A. right now at the same hospital I plan to work at when I --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- become a nurse.  So --
R:  Oh, okay.  So, you're already ...
L:  -- so I kinda get the feel of the place.
R:  Yeah.  I know it is -- I mean, that also gives you -- exactly -- gives you a good perspective on what, uh --
L:  Exactly.
R:  -- what is the commitment in -- in that kinda job.
L:  And the nurses there go through and I can talk to all the nurses there and see what they're doing.
R:  Excellent, very good.  Do you have -- this -- your family with you as well or -- or are you just by -- you know, like your own ...?
L:  Yeah, I have all my family there.
R:  Well, that's great.
L:  Actually, um, my mother, my sister, my aunt and my uncle all work at the same hospital with me, the same hours.  So [LAUGH] --
R:  Oh, my gosh!  [LAUGH]
L:  -- so we're all pretty close.
R:  That is cute.  Yeah.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I know.  I can imagine.  Well, I -- I'm sure you have, you know -- when you -- when you need to vent out they're right there with you, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yep.  [LAUGH]
R:  And I hear a lotta people need to vent out in the nursing -- you know, in the in- -- nursing industry because it's, uh -- you know, it -- there's a lot of -- like I said, there's a lot of rewards and there's also a lot of things that you have to sort of, uh, learn to cope with and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and put up with.  So --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- that's great.  That's really great.
L:  There's a lotta options to go with in that job.  You can go -- with that career you can so -- so many different places.
R:  Yeah.  So --
L:  Different types of work.
R:  -- does your -- does your family help you with the kid or -- or you got ...?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Oh, they do?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That's nice.  But they're working at the same times that you are, so do you like do day care with the child or ...?
L:  Well, my mother in law watches her while I'm at work and then --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- when I go to school different family will watch her --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and everything.
R:  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  So, there's more to the family than the ones that, uh, go to -- go to -- to, uh -- to the job with you.  So, that's --
L:  Yeah, there's --
R:  -- that's, uh -- that's really cute.
L:  -- I have a lot of 'em.  [LAUGH]
R:  That's wonderful.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah, I'm happy that -- it sounds like you have, uh, things under -- under control and, uh -- even though, you know -- I think -- you know, I've -- I've always looked at -- at, um -- I mean, I think it's a wonderful experience to, you know, have children --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and, you know, see your family grow.  But I just see the lifestyle in the United States that is so difficult, you know, it's becoming more and more difficult.  There's a lot more demands on your time and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- it's, uh -- it's a blessing when see- -- you know, people have family that they can rely on to take care of their children because, you know, you see so many kids growing up in day care and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- I mean, it's not about option.  It's just simply that I think it's -- it's a difficult option, especially when they're really, really young, you know?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Once they're, you know ...?
L:  It's nice when they can be with people they know.
R:  Yeah.  Exactly.  At least, you know, feel like they have a -- a maternal and a -- and a family love that -- you know, as much as day care tries to supply -- I don't think it's ever gonna be the same.  So, I think ya -- you know, that's a -- that's a blessing that you have that, you know, they have -- you have that option.
L:  Mhm.
R:  That's very cool.
L:  It's nice.
R:  And, um [LIPSMACK], yeah, I just moved from Miami -- from Boston to Miami.  So, I'm adjusting to the heat and all that here.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  It's definitely, uh -- it's the only change from -- I keep checking back in Boston like, "How are the temperatures over there?" and only when they tell me it's in the thirties I feel like well, maybe I don't have it so bad.  But it's, uh --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's -- it's quite a different change, you know?  It's difficult to maintain.
L:  Mhm.
R:  But anyway, well, it -- I probably will have to cut this -- our conversation short even though they do want ten minutes, but I'm about to go into a tunnel and it -- I will probably lose the signal.
L:  Okay.
R:  So, um, well, it was nice meeting and --
L:  You too.
R:  -- nice talking to you.
L:  You too.
R:  Bye-bye.
L:  Bye.
