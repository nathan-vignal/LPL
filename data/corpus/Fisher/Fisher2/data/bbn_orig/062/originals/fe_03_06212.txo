R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  M- uh, my name is Donna.
R:  Hi, my name is Jean.
L:  Hi, Jean.  Well, we're gonna talk about hobbies.
R:  Yeah.  Do you know how many times we're allowed to call about this a day or is it --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- once a day?
L:  I really don't know.  I'm not sure if it's once a day or, um, more.
R:  Yeah.  It says you can participate in up to three calls.
L:  So I guess we'd get different people each time, so you'd probably be able --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- to call again, I guess.
R:  That's what I'm trying to do! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.
R:  Yeah.  Where are you from?
L:  South Carolina.
R:  I'm from New Orleans.
L:  Oh, I'm coming down there in a couple of weeks, um --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- on vacation.
R:  Where you going?
L:  Um, well we go down to Biloxi about three or four times a -- a year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, um, we usually try to go into New Orleans for a couple of nights anyway.
R:  Do you have any favorite hobbies that you do while you're in New Orleans?
L:  Um, main -- my main hobby is shopping! [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, I love to shop too.
L:  Shopping and eating and, um, we go to the casinos, um, you know, the Heroes, we'll --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we'll hit that while we're down there.  But, um, we love to hit the, you know, the different restaurants.  We try to go to Emerelle's[?] restaurant --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- while we're down there.
R:  [LIPSMACK] Mhm.
L:  Any recommendations on good restaurants?
R:  Um, if your hobby is eating, there's a place out in Nattery[?] called Copelands.
L:  Copelands?
R:  Yeah.  And, um, [NOISE] that's a good place to eat.
L:  [inaudible] that's out of town?
R:  It's not -- about twenty minutes from New Orleans, it's not that far.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Are you flying -- flying in?
L:  No, we're driving.
R:  Oh, well then you have plenty of time to, um, [NOISE] -- they might even have a second location in New Orleans, I'm not really sure. [NOISE]
L:  Oh, okay.  So what -- h- -- what are your hobbies?
R:  [NOISE] Um, well, stay at home mom, raising my kids, um, [NOISE] I like to do coupons [NOISE] --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- refunding and stuff like that. [NOISE]
L:  I do that too, that's where I found out about this.  Do you belong to the, um, Refunding Makes Cents?
R:  No, but, um, someone I talked to earlier --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- belonged to that.  Um, this was on Fat Wallet, are you familiar with that?
L:  No, I've never u- -- never done that one --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- Fat Wallet?
R:  Yeah.  That's another, um, thing.  But, uh, what I'm interested in, um, in looking up the Refunding Makes Cents.  Is it Refunding Makes Cents or Refunds Makes Cents?
L:  Refunding.  I.N.G.
R:  Ref- --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- -unding, okay.
L:  Um, yeah, I -- I've belonged to it for about two years now and I have really -- they've alerted me to a lotta good deals and coupons --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, I check the -- uh, they have like a chit chat, you know, I check that.  I try to check it every day.
R:  How much time do you usually spend couponing?
L:  Um, probably, I don't know, maybe three or four hours a week.
R:  Oh, that's -- that's good.
L:  Yeah.  Just getting myself organized and -- and then, you know, shopping.
R:  Do you think it's something that everyone should do?
L:  Mm, well, I know lots of people that don't and they look --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- at me like I'm crazy, so --
R:  The majority of the coupons aren't used they -- they say.
L:  I -- I -- I can understand that.  I mean --
R:  [SIGH]
L:  -- people just don't take the time, um, I don't have any children --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, but I -- I teach school and I, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- I have a full time job, but, um, you know, I make time for that because I -- I like to see that I'm saving money.
R:  I -- I'm -- also I've been guilty of picking up receipts in parking lots for refunds! [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah?  Um, but you know, not [MN] -- I'll go to a store and if I don't have my coupons and I see something I need, I'll go back home and get my coupons and come back, you know, I just won't buy it.
R:  Sounds like I would do.
L:  So, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  But I've, you know, I've saved a lot.  Um, do you do test drives?
R:  Um, no, um ...  Um, let's see, I'm trying to think.  No, I did it once and I -- I -- I had -- I had the guy sign it and it went through and then they needed something else and I'm saying, "You know", uh, but I hear a lotta people, um [PAUSE] -- I hear a lotta people, um, do it.  Have you done it?
L:  Yeah, um, we go- -- I've gotten a lot of, um, Christmas gifts, things like that, that I, you know, um, nice watches, um, fifty dollar gift certificates, um, that's one of the easiest, you know, it's just kinda hard to -- to find 'em.  I mean, you know, you had to be alerted to 'em, um, but, uh, y- you know, it's pretty easy.  I don't mi- -- you know, again, it's just time.  And with children, I mean, I can understand, you know, it does take some time to go and do it and sometimes you have to drive the car and sometimes you don't.  sometimes they'll just fill it out for ya.
R:  Hm.  Yeah, that's -- that's what she was saying, but I mean, this guy was like, looking at me like, "Hey, you're really gonna do it" and I -- it was for like luggage or a watch or something, I forget.
L:  Uh-huh, yeah.
R:  And -- I don't know.
L:  D- did you finally get it though?  I mean, did you get --
R:  I di- -- I -- no, I got it back.  I got it sent back in the mail, after waiting six weeks, saying I need something else [inaudible] the [inaudible], I'm like, "You know what?  Forget it".
L:  Oh, like a number or something?  Yeah.
R:  I -- I got the number, I even got 'em to sign it.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I should have just told 'em up front what I was trying to do.
L:  Well that's what I've done.  I usually just say, um, you know, "I've -- I've got this test drive paper or whatever and I --"
R:  Right.
L:  "-- you know, I'm -- I wanna get the gifts and --"
R:  So traveling is more or less your hobby?
L:  Yeah, we t- -- we travel a lot, mhm.
R:  Mm, that's something everyone should do.  I don't know if I'm gonna do the cruise ships or not, I haven't felt comfortable doing that.
L:  Um, yeah, I've -- I've been on, um, two or three cruises, um, I -- we went on our honeymoon like, about thirteen years ago, on a cruise and, you know, it's really nice because, um, you don't have to make decisions, "Where are we gonna eat tonight?"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "Where -- where are we gonna stay?" things like that.  Everything's right on the boat and it -- it's -- it's nice.  I, um, I don't really like to fly so, um, I'm just kinda frightened, you know, with this -- the way things are today.  I just, um, I'd rather drive.  I don't [MN] -- my husband says I'm crazy because we, you know, it's probably easier to get into a car wreck than airplane crash but I feel more in control when I'm driving.  So, um, usually we drive when, you know, for travel.
R:  Oh okay, so I'm sure you have a lotta coupons for rental cars, this and that?
L:  Yeah, um [COUGH] I use, um, oh, like this -- we're -- you know, we do gamble a good bit.  Um, again that's another hobby of ours.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  My husband enjoys that.  More than me.  I -- I just do the slot machines but, um, you know, we're going --
R:  You ever hit it big on the slot machines?
L:  Well, about five hundred dollars is all I've ever won.
R:  Not bad.
L:  Well, you know --
R:  Pay for your trip back.
L:  Yeah, I -- I just play the nickels. [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Um, but I -- I love it.  I mean, I -- I love just, you know, doing that, but, um, and the, you know, just thinking that maybe I might --
R:  So you think it's something everyone -- you know, I've -- I tried gambling once and I lost like, twenty dollars in five minutes and I said, "Never again".
L:  Yeah.
R:  Uh, it's just it -- it, um, you know, scared me.
L:  Yeah.  Well, we kinda look at -- you know, again, like vacation and, you know, if you're gonna be going out to movies or whatever, you know, you're gonna pay for that and we kinda look at it that way.  But when we go down this -- we're going in -- we're going in Wednesday the twenty eighth we're leaving -- um, we're staying all week for free, um, you know, at the hotel.  They send us these coupons every month because we -- we go three or four times a year, um --
R:  Hm.
L:  -- and our meals are usually free, so I mean, it -- it works out if you figure what you're gonna pay for a hotel for a week.  We just spend it on, um, gambling, so it works out pretty well.
R:  It sounds like it did, yeah.
L:  And, um, also, I -- I have one of those credit cards with The Hilton --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- where I get points and you -- you know --
R:  Oh, yes, for seeing the shows and making reservations and stuff like that.
L:  Yeah.  And you just -- you add up your points and then you get free rooms also.  So, um, like, my gas and my -- I just put it on the credit card and pay it off every month and --
R:  We used to buy a new car and -- and put it on the credit card --
L:  Right, right.
R:  -- and see all those points.
L:  Yeah.  And then, you know, at least you're getting a little something besides just interest [LAUGH].  You know, you're -- you're getting something back, so we use that too, so -- I'm always looking for, you know, ways to save money or, you know, try to get ahead.
R:  Yeah, me too.  Well, it's been fun talking to ya.  It must be close to that ten minutes.
L:  You think our ten -- they said they would tell us when the ten minutes --
R:  Yeah, you get thirty seconds and then -- and then they let you know.  I'm just curious how long -- how -- how many times we can call.  I'm still kind of confused, they're gonna call us, right?
L:  Well, this is the first time I've ever done it.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um, i- I understood that they would call us but if they didn't you could call this number.
R:  Right.  I didn't know if you could call once a day.  It said, "You may participate in up to three calls".
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Every one you record will be given a virtual lottery ticket and you also receive ten dollars per call.
L:  Right.
R:  So three -- up to three calls, it doesn't say per day.  Maybe I could email 'em with that question.
L:  Yeah, maybe.  I don't -- I --
R:  Yeah.
L:  You know, I'm not sure.
R:  I know.  [several inaudible words].
L:  Or you can just try calling again.
R:  That's what I did, this is my second time.  But I'm gonna wait till tomorrow and email 'em and -- and ask 'em.  But it's been a pleasure talking to you.
L:  Yeah, I've enjoyed it.
R:  Yeah, me too.
L:  Well, do you think our ten minutes is up?
R:  Getting close to it, let me see.
L:  Oh, you're checking, okay.  I just thought they were gonna come in and tell us.  Um --
R:  I got eleven on here.  Did you see any -- did you hear anything beep or anything?
L:  Well, I was looking on my computer, it said five twenty six and now I've got five thirty six, but I don't know if it counted like, at the beginning --
R:  When you begin.
L:  -- where I did all the little, you know, where you had to put your numbers in.  Um, I also do scrapbooking --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- do you do any kind of ...?
R:  I'm sorry?
L:  I also do scrapbooking.  Do you do any --
R:  Oh, that's always fun, to do scrapbooking.
L:  Yeah.
R:  And it's something you can do portfolios for your kids.
L:  Yeah.  Uh, you know, I teach school so, um, I use it a lot with school, w- --
R:  Oh, what grade do you teach?
L:  I teach fourth.
R:  Oh, my son's in fifth [inaudible] one of my sons are in fifth.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So --
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, [COUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] We have to wait until that beep comes on, I don't know how long it's gonna take.  Hello?
L:  Yeah, I'm here, I'm here. [LAUGH]
R:  Oh okay, that's fine.
L:  So, um, any other --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  What a- -- what about, um, a- are there any really good deals w- -- any good shops or anything to see down in New Orleans?
R:  Um, the antique shops if you're into antiquing.  Um, catch +some -- some of the shows at the -- at the theaters downtown.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  They -- and I -- they most recently banned the -- the people from the French Quarter, the -- the Ma- -- the Ma- I'm see -- the only people who
