R:  Okay.
L:  -- and -- or behind the computer.  So, now that I'm home -- I've been home about a year -- and I'm still having problems not staying behind the computer.  So, um, doing things, you know, like doing searches and I got into doing free -- finding free things --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- on the Internet --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and, uh, that's what I do.  The problem is it take -- it -- I'm here all day, just like I'm working a full job --
R:  Ok- ...
L:  -- but I'm really not working a job.  I'm just kinda -- I'm using it where it's -- it's taking my complete time.
R:  Yeah.
L:  This isn't our real home.  Our h- -- we're living in a trailer, um, in Georgia because our home is in South Carolina.  We both work for the government and we both -- they had base closure.
R:  Oh.
L:  They closed the base.  Seven thousand people lost their jobs --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- and, uh, so my husband only has a couple more years.  I only had six more years and then I got sick.  So, I had to leave [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, so that's what I'm doing, why my -- I -- my hobbies are -- I mean, I do almost anything crafty, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  I've wallpapered -- wallpapered my room.  I love -- I have a little pond.  My son and I --
R:  Oh, lucky you.
L:  -- built a baby pond with -- with goldfish and --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- and put some coy in it and, um, then ...
R:  Yeah.  In Georgia it's always warm.  [LAUGH] So, you can have a pond.
L:  Yes.  We -- yeah, well, now, um, that's -- my house is in South Carolina and I've been here, um, about two years.  So, my pond is at home.  But that's the things I'm really into now.  I just, um, got one of those little barrel ponds here this weekend --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- you know, and I'm gonna do a little pond in my ...  So, this is a kinda temporary home and I miss my fish 'cause that's a -- a kinda relaxing type thing.  You go out to --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- my pond was really -- not real big now, we're talking about just like a little ornamental pond --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and it was maybe -- oh, maybe about six foot by four foot, or six foot by three foot, something like that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and about three and a foot deep.
R:  Oh, that's enough.
L:  Yeah.  But we had [LAUGH] last summer, um -- ac- actually it was the summer before last I had, um, some really big fantail goldfish in there and they had had babies that spring.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  Uh, yeah, the eggs had grown and, you know, it was really cool and I noticed -- we live about a mile from the river, which is right off the Atlantic Ocean --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- [LAUGH] and, uh, I noticed this big old crane in my yard --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- which I had never, ever seen a crane in my yard before --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- 'cause we kinda live -- we have two acres on a major highway.
R:  Okay.
L:  But the next thing I realized that he was in my pond --
R:  Oh, no.
L:  -- and he eat all my fish.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, it was such a small area that it didn't take him anything, this crane to eat all my fish up.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, poor fish!  [LAUGH]
L:  I know and, you know, I had these really -- I had like one or two real expensive, um [LIPSMACK] -- um, uh, lilies, water lilies --
R:  Ah.
L:  -- and, uh, so he messed all my plants up and dirtied the water.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, no.
L:  I just wanted to cry, you know, and he -- he eat all the babies up because they were so tiny they just weren't -- all he had to do was open his mouth.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, yeah, and -- and then ...
L:  So, this time -- I'm in Geor- -- in Georgia and we're in a small place called St Mary's, which is the Kings Bay naval base here --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and, um, so it's a little small town, but we have a lotta raccoons around here.
R:  Oh, yeah?
L:  So, I've decided this little pond that I'm gonna have in a half of a wood b- or -- or crate, you know, one of those wood barrels, you know, that they do wine in.
R:  Yeah.
L:  Well, I'm gonna put this on the porch.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  That way the raccoons and the birds can't get to 'em.
R:  Well, I don't know if raccoons the -- on the porches -- the porch covered?
L:  Yes.
R:  Okay.
L:  It's covered.  It's -- it's a screened in porch.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  It's a front porch.  Yeah.
R:  Because the raccoon, uh [LAUGH], does not, uh -- many thing, uh --
L:  Well, you're right.
R:  -- they can do, huh?
L:  Oh, you're right bec- but I have -- I have cats around here now.  So, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- they've -- the raccoons have torn through the screen in porch before.
R:  Oh.
L:  I mean, they've just ripped the screen.  I have cats sitting out on the front porch.  That's where I was feeding the cats.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  And, uh, the raccoons wanted to cat food.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, then I pulled that up.  I mean, after they tore two holes in the screen --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and we had to fix that I took the cat food -- now, I have to bring the cats inside to feed them [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH] Oh, wow!
L:  -- to keep the raccoons from getting their food and then I was -- last summer I was putting water out there for the cats, you know, just to 'em cool, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- when they came into the screen porch and then the raccoons were after the water.
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  So, then I couldn't do that.  So, now the -- the cats have water outside [LAUGH] --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- in the back yard and I try to ...
R:  With the raccoons?
L:  With the raccoons, yeah.
R:  And the crane?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  Well, the crane's in the other house now.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But these raccoons, um, they come -- 'cause there's like a l- -- we have like an open porch in the back that goes to like a little wash room and the raccoons come up right up on the steps and sit there and -- side by side with the cats.
R:  Oh.  That's cute.
L:  And they just [inaudible] my mind, you know, I scoot -- scoot them away, you know, scoot, scoot and, uh, I know the next door neighbor he has a little B.B. gun and he'll -- he'll like try to shoot 'em, which is not gonna hurt 'em, it just bounces off of 'em.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But it does -- they couldn't care a less.  It didn't [LAUGH], you know ...?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But I asked him not -- I -- I hate thinking that they might really hurt them, like in their eye or something, you know?
R:  Oh, yeah.
L:  So, I asked him [LAUGH] not to do that.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So ...
R:  He wants to help you.
L:  Yeah.  To -- yeah.  So, the third -- so that's my third hobby is cats.
R:  Ah.
L:  I have Persians.
R:  [MN]
L:  I have ...
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  I started with, uh, just one, a little female and then I was breeding her with, um, anot- -- with somebody else's male --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and then she -- the first time she had a little -- a real small baby and that baby I nursed to health and so I kept it.  So, then -- then I bought -- I finally bought a male.  So, then I was selling my babies, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and they were having babies once a year.  Well, it got to the point where in every litter there was one -- well, I'm talking every litter -- I'm talking about three litters [LAUGH] --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- there was one baby that always was sick that I had to nurse with a baby bottle --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- and now I've ended up keeping 'em.  So, now I have five Persian cats.
R:  [MN] Oh, wow!
L:  I know.  It's too many.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  And -- but they all have their own little personalities --
R:  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
L:  -- and -- with the exception of the mother and the, um -- the fath- -- the one father is -- he's now too old to -- to, um -- to mate or anything --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and we got him --
