L:  Hello?
R:  Yeah.  Hello.
L:  Hi.  This is Karen.
R:  Oh, hi.  This is Melanie.  I -- I didn't hear the beginning of the recording 'cause my husband picked up the phone.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, boy.  Oh, we're supposed to talk about hobbies.
R:  Okay.
L:  And, um, it's supposed to be, um [LIPSMACK] [SIGH], do you think hobbies are important?
R:  Right.
L:  And what kinda hobbies do you do?
R:  Yeah.  Okay.
L:  And -- and, um, how much time --
R:  Oh -- oh, shoot --
L:  -- should you spend doing hobbies.
R:  -- someone's beeping.  Can you hold on one second?
L:  Okay.
R:  Okay.  I'll be right back.  [PAUSE]  Okay.  Sorry.  Our daughter's leaving for New York tonight.  [LAUGH]
L:  Okay.  [COUGH]
R:  Okay.  Anyway, do you wanna go first?
L:  Oh, okay.  [COUGH]  I -- the only thing I really think about a hobby to me is it's something that takes up a lotta your time, or that you really look into.
R:  Okay.
L:  I had a -- a part time job at, uh, a hobby, uh, coin collecting shop --
R:  Uh-huh.  Oh, okay.
L:  -- and you would be surprised how much money people put into this hobby.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, 'cause every ...
L:  You know?  And I'm like I couldn't care a less.
R:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
L:  But, you know, people really --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- get on the Internet and they look everywhere for the stuff.
R:  Right.
L:  But as for me the only thing I really --
R:  Well, that's more ...
L:  -- like doing is like bowling.
R:  [NOISE] Yeah.  Well, that -- that -- coin collecting is more of a, um -- an investment thing, you know, it's not just a hobby, it's an investment.
L:  Well, yeah.
R:  People do it for a hobby -- a hobby to me is I paint, like I do arts and crafts.
L:  Oh, you do?
R:  Yeah.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  So, that's -- that's kinda my hobby.
L:  Do you -- do you sell 'em?
R:  I have, yeah.
L:  Oh, that's cool.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So ...
L:  Are you from New Mexico?
R:  No, I'm in California.
L:  Oh, because [COUGH] I knew this lady from New Mexico just, you know, in passing, one of those, uh, trade show things or whatever they're called --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- that they have on the street market, whatever, and she was from New Mexico and she -- she did this thing that started out as a hobby --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and what it was, was -- man, it was like three D. or something.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But it was just a painting that she did.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But as you moved the painting moved with you, you know --
R:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
L:  -- and you could see another thing and oh, man, it was like really neat.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And I think if you got into a hobby like that that's turn out being a side money thing, or you're gonna make money, I think that'd be pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.  Well, I sell my paintings.  But a hobby could also be to relax.  Collecting things.  I collect, uh, anything that has dogs in it, you know, dog statutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Like what?
R:  Dog figurines, anything with dogs or angels.
L:  Oh, uh-huh.
R:  Where -- where are you?
L:  I'm in, uh, Colorado.
R:  Oh, okay.  So, you signed up for -- for this -- this little -- this study thing?
L:  Uh-huh, on the Internet.  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, they're recording this?
L:  Yes.
R:  'Cause it was really strange, but after I gave all my information somebody posted that they did this and they didn't get paid.
L:  They what?
R:  That they didn't get paid and to be careful.
L:  Oh.
R:  [LAUGH] And I was really -- I was thinking okay.  I don't know.
L:  Oh, no.  I don't worry about it.  [COUGH]
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  I'm into a lot of the shops and so I don't worry about it.
R:  You mean ...?
L:  I know eventually it'll happen.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Um, but, you know, my husband started collecting, um, um, like -- well, I don't know if they were stamps or --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- what he was collecting -- something.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But they were like stamps made into metal.
R:  Oh, uh-huh.
L:  And I don't know what they were called or what.
R:  Yeah.
L:  But he was into those for a while and I think it got to be pretty costly.  He really didn't tell me, but --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- I think it got to be pretty costly.
R:  Yeah.
L:  So, I think he stopped.
R:  Yeah.  Well, my hobbies usually turn into things that I can sell and make money on, um, any kind of fad items that come along --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- because I'm artistic I can pick up and -- and do that.  But I don't have much time anymore.
L:  You what?
R:  I don't have much time anymore --
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  -- between working and ...
L:  That's usually the problem.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've gotta ...
L:  That's usually the problem.  And then that's one of the other questions, is how much time do you think you should spend doing your hobby?
R:  I think it depends on much free time you have because like I bought a canvas to paint recently --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and I haven't had a chance because I -- I work two jobs --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- and, uh, I don't have a whole lotta time.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, I ...
L:  Is that noise coming from your end?
R:  I don't hear anything.
L:  Oh.  Um, well, maybe it's on my -- on my phone.  [COUGH]
R:  You -- you sound like you have a cold.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, um, yeah, my mother in law paints.
R:  Really?
L:  And she does it because she enjoys it.
R:  Yeah, right.  I do.  I love it.  But if there's no time, I mean, you have to have -- I -- talking about time to sit down and start an oil painting you need a good three, four hours with no interruptions --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and, uh, that's -- that's hard to find sometimes.
L:  Well, she was taking a class --
R:  Mhm.  Yeah.
L:  -- and so then everybody just started falling in love with her paintings and at first she was doing for like relaxation I guess, a hobby --
R:  Mhm.  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and then it turned out to where she was really filling up her whole house and then she -- people started seeing it.  So, then she started getting other people that wanted stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- so she started making it for people.
R:  Right.
L:  But she's never sold any and we've told her that --
R:  [COUGH] Oh, really?
L:  -- you know, we've seen --
R:  Oh, I started selling my ...
L:  -- some of her stuff.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I have two in my house --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and it's like when people come over and they're like, "Wow!  Who did this for you?"
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've been painting for years.  Years.  But I'm, um -- I sold them when I was younger.
L:  Huh.
R:  But, um, so, getting back to hobbies.  So, what other hobbies?  My husband bowls.  So, that -- that was his hobby.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, well, that's -- that's what -- I don't know if you wanna say that that's actually a hobby.  That's like an entertainment, don't you think?
R:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
L:  But --
R:  Um ...
L:  -- I mean, I -- I would call it a hobby to me because I do it as much as I can, any time I have time --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- or free time or whatever that's what I -- the first thing I wanna do is go bowling.
R:  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I like -- I like any arts and crafts type of thing.
L:  Well, like some people say that their hobby is, um, going to the movies --
R:  Hm.  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, and ...
R:  Well, my hobby then is going on cruises.  [LAUGH]
L:  Huh?
R:  Going on cruises.  I sell cruises also.
L:  Oh, no.
R:  So, we love to do that --
L:  Yeah.  [COUGH]
R:  -- and ...
L:  Well, I would be surprised -- you know, I mean, people probably have that as their hobby too.
R:  Right.
L:  But it just -- I -- I don't know.  I guess you have to define hobby and everybody individually probably thinks that it's something different.
R:  Yeah.  How 'bout decorating?  I love to decorate, you know, I'm constantly changing the house.
L:  Yeah.
R:  Collecting things, uh, updating.  That's a hobby.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Keeping, uh, with the fashions, up to date in the house.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  So, um, I don't know.
L:  So then how much should a person spend doing their hobby?
R:  [NOISE] That's really hard to say --
L:  Yeah.  That's what I think.
R:  -- because I don't think it's a daily thing.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  At least to me I don't.  It depends on what -- what their passion is and how much time they have to spend on it.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Some people cook and bake, you know?
L:  Yeah.  You know what?  I was thinking about that too.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I used to think that cooking was my hobby.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah, because, I mean, I just -- I mean, I used to collect -- well, actually collecting the cookbooks was more like my hobby.
R:  Oh, really?  Really?  'Cause I like decorating cakes 'cause I'm an artist.  But I'm not a great baker.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh.
R:  But I can decorate it.  So, um ...
L:  Well, you can come decorate my house.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] Yeah.  I wish I had more time.
L:  Um, yeah, because I had so many cookbooks.  I mean, honestly, I must've had over five hundred cookbooks --
R:  Wow!
L:  -- before I realized it --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- you know, and, um, I mean, I had like two shelves -- I mean, two of those, um, four shelf things --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- that you buy.  I had them full.
R:  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I didn't realize and I was like wow, you know, this is just like [LAUGH] -- I think I went overboard here.
R:  Yeah.  I don't have any cookbooks because --
L:  Huh?
R:  -- I don't like to [LAUGH] -- no, I don't have that many cookbooks.  I'm very practical.
L:  No, well, I don't anymore.
R:  I collect [inaudible], you know, big ...
L:  But -- and then I like to experiment, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- with different recipes and stuff.
R:  Mhm.
L:  But I guess -- I guess, you know --
R:  That's a hobby.
L:  -- I must've had a hobby and not even realizing it.
R:  Yeah.  Yeah, 'cause my grandmother used to bake all the time.
L:  Bake.  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah.  That was her ...  There's a lady -- I'm in real estate and there's a lady that, uh, works with the -- whatever financial company -- and every Monday she brings cakes in for us, and I asked her one day, "How do you ...? -- that's her -- that's her relaxation, her hobby.  She bakes on Sunday and brings the cakes in.
L:  Huh.
R:  So, I would get pretty tired of that.  [LAUGH]  But, um ...
L:  Well, that's pretty cool.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That's pretty cool.
R:  I like, uh -- I've been collecting items.  I collect, um [inaudible], you know, the figurines?  Do you know what those are?
L:  Col- um, collecting what?
R:  [inaudible], they're figurines.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Yeah, I collect those and I started collecting things with angels.
L:  So, if you -- if you collect something like that you'd think that would be considered a hobby?
R:  I -- I think it is because --
L:  Because ...
R:  -- I go out looking, you know, if I'm out shopping and I'll see a --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- specific item that goes with, uh, the set.  I think so.  Sure.
L:  Because, um, like some people collect frogs and, you know --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- and little cat figurines and, you know --
R:  Uh-huh.  Right.
L:  -- cat pot holders and --
R:  [COUGH] Yeah.
L:  -- anything cat -- decor that they can hang up on the wall and stuff --
R:  Right.
L:  -- and, you know, frogs and -- and some people do owls and --
R:  Right.
L:  -- just whatever -- pigs --
R:  Right.  Right.
L:  -- and cows.  I mean, years ago it used to be cows.
R:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
L:  Everything in the kitchen was cows and swans and --
R:  That's right.
L:  -- people collect just about anything.  So, I guess that would be like a hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  They'll put -- you know, some people just go overboard --
R:  Right.  Right.  But, um --
L:  -- on getting the stuff.
R:  -- people knit and sew.  I like to sew.
L:  Yeah.  I have a friend if it's light green she -- you know, she goes and it's --
