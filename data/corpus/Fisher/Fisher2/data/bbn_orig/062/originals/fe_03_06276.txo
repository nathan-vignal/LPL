R:  Hello?
L:  Hello.
R:  Hi, my name is Laurie.
L:  And my name is Caroline.
R:  And where are you from?
L:  I'm from Columbia, South Carolina.  And you?
R:  I'm from the metro Milwaukee, Wisconsin area.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  Home of the breweries and the bucks.  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, well then.  [LAUGH]
R:  And what's your hobbies -- or your favorite hobby?
L:  I -- well, right now I like painting.
R:  Okay.
L:  Um, not, uh ...
R:  It's finding the time?  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  Exactly.
R:  Yes.  I have, uh, two fourteen year old boys.  I'm divorced.  So, my hobbies have kinda slid by the wayside but, uh, we've -- we've gotten two Pomeranian dogs.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  We got those for their birthday last fall --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and, um, they've taken a lotta time.
L:  I bet.  So ...
R:  So, but it's been interesting 'cause we've always -- I always grew up with a house cat.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  So, it's been -- it's been a nice change because dogs are so much more loving.  You know, cats are, but to a different point.
L:  Right.
R:  It's always on their terms, where the dogs seem to always wanna [LAUGH] ...
L:  [LAUGH] Of course.
R:  Yes.  So, they're almost seven months old now --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and, um, in fact we just had been out for a walk.  So, I had just come in the house when I heard the phone ringing.  [LAUGH]
L:  Isn't it something?  [LAUGH]  I was reading a book and, um --
R:  Were you?
L:  -- my grandson said he was the phone and it just happened I -- I looked at my caller I.D. and said, "Okay, that's one of those calls I'm supposed to be answering".  [LAUGH]
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I picked up and he didn't know what to do with it.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  So, I told him, "Listen, I'll handle the call".  [LAUGH]
R:  Right.  Now, did you -- you registered for the second round of these, or were you -- is this your first round of doing this?
L:  Uh, this is my second.
R:  Okay.
L:  Mhm.
R:  Yeah.  That's mine too.  I only got one -- I kept missing the other time when they were calling.
L:  Yeah, me too.
R:  Yep.  It just -- it was a busy time or something and I kept -- I -- you know, missing it.  So [LIPSMACK] -- so, I was glad they had another round --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- to sign up 'cause it seems like I'm at least -- and I signed up for later times.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, me too because every time they'd call I was either walking out the door or just getting in --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- and it just wasn't a good time.  So, I said, okay, let's try to do this thing around nine or ten o'clock --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and maybe it'll work.
R:  So, what book are you reading?
L:  Um, uh, it's a book a girlfriend of mine gave me and said I had to read it.  It was, um, real interesting.  It's by Eric Jerome Dickie.  It's called Sister, Sister.  [LAUGH]
R:  Okay.  Okay.  All right.
L:  And it's a good book.  I'm almost at the end.
R:  I'm actually reading the, um, story about Kelly Flynn.
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  Do you remember her?  She got ousted out of the, um [LIPSMACK] -- the army because she had had the, um, affair with the -- well, he had told her he was single, but he was apparently married or going through a divorce --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and they had dismissed out of the, uh -- she was the first military person I think to, uh, pilot a U. -- a bomber flight --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- or one of those -- I'm -- I'm just getting to her -- what her love -- or what her, um, aspects that she got stationed in, uh, South Dakota for --
L:  Right.
R:  -- or North Dakota.  Or is it North Dakota?   [LAUGH]  But, anyway, it's -- it's just coming to that point and she really faced a lot of upheavals --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and I haven't gotten to the part that, you know, it was the most devastating for her.  But, uh, it's tough being a woman in the military just from what it sounds like from her book.
L:  I bet it is.
R:  Yeah.  I just got it in one of those dollar stores.  It was just like --
L:  Oh, really?
R:  -- you know, yeah, a clearance sale.  [LAUGH]
L:  How 'bout that?  [LAUGH]
R:  Are those the big rage down there?
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  Yeah.  Oh, I know they're all -- they just have like -- that's all there is now.
L:  Everything in there.
R:  Yeah, and it is, nice stuff.
L:  Yes, it is.
R:  And so ...
L:  In fact, um, I was really surprised.  I was buying some gifts for my children -- my grandsons', um --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- teachers --
R:  Sure.
L:  -- and so I made some baskets --
R:  Oh, cool.
L:  -- and I went to the dollar store and I got candles and little trinkets and things to go in there for each teacher --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- and, uh -- his four teachers and I didn't have to spend five dollars for -- for each one --
R:  Oh, I know.  I know.
L:  -- and it's a beautiful basket.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  You can get some very, very, very nice things.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I agree.
L:  So, I was being ...
R:  And they're kinda fun 'cause the kids can take their money --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and spend it and --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and ...  [NOISE] Actually the dogs are hooked up.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  They're having some air.
L:  Oh, okay.
R:  They -- we had rain here last night so they got -- well, I took 'em out for a walk.  They have to have at least, uh, a jaunt around our subdivision --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or else they don't sleep well.  So, then they were wet when I c- came back.
L:  Oh.
R:  So, they got their baths, but they love 'em.  They love -- I can just throw 'em in the shower with me and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's so relaxing.  So ...  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I've never -- I didn't think dogs liked -- my grandmother had a Schnauzer --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and I didn't think dogs like their baths 'cause Pepper did not really -- he -- he -- he did okay, but he'd get out --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and shake and just run around the house like a mad ...
L:  Around the house?  [MN]
R:  Yep.
L:  I have a Cocker Spaniel --
R:  Okay.  Okay.
L:  -- and every time we give him his bath the first place he runs is my bed and jump on it --
R:  Yep.
L:  -- and it drives me bananas.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.
L:  The boys have to come in here and try the pull the damn dog off my bed.
R:  I know.  Well, he wants to dry off --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- or just rub ...  Yeah.
L:  And roll around and shake it right in my room and I'm like oh, no.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] And it's every time?
L:  Yes.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yes.
R:  They are ...
L:  This is his comfort zone for some reason.  [LAUGH]
R:  [LAUGH] That is.  It's -- it's just amazing how the -- the animals -- and it -- it was so funny.  We were -- just laughed so hard when my grandma's dog would do that and she was older when they got it.  So, I was about -- I was the grandchild that would come and give him his bath and it was just -- we would just crack up.  He would just -- just run around the furniture just like a wild man that we'd never seen before --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and he just felt so good and oh, man!
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So, he [LAUGH] -- these guys are a little more mellower than that, but they still -- they feel good.
L:  Yeah.
R:  They -- they like the warm water and I'm glad I can just take 'em in with me and then I -- then I do my shower and [LAUGH] --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- we're all three done.  So ...
L:  [LAUGH] There you go.
R:  That's good.  That's good.  So, um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- so any other hobbies that you have?
L:  No.  Just, um, I like to do the painting and then, uh, I've gotten into making little gift baskets as well --
R:  Okay.  Uh-huh.
L:  -- and giving them to friends.
R:  And reading?  Yeah.
L:  And, um, I just love doing those things because the dollar store is my favorite store.  [LAUGH]
R:  Yes.  Yes.  [LAUGH]  I know.  I know.  There isn't -- I know.  It's -- it's worked out so well for us too --
L:  Yes, it has.
R:  -- you know, it's worked out.  Just at Christmas and -- and just if you have to run -- and they've gotten, um -- they call 'em the Almost -- Always Ninety Nine's --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and that's almost like, um, a grocery --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- you know, they've turned it into almost -- do you have [inaudible] down there?
L:  No, I don't have the, um, Almost Ninety Nine here.
R:  Okay.  Because they've got milk and ice cream and frozen goods into -- you know, and everything's ninety nine cents --
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  -- and I think it's stuff like, you know, stores -- it's close maybe to the expiration date maybe --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- or it's over stock or whatever but, um, it's like where they moved into used to be a huge grocery store and they have filled the whole thing up.
L:  Oh, wow!
R:  So, it's all, you know, cards, you know, greeting cards and party supplies, you know, bags for gifts.  It's ...
L:  I would love that --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- because I -- I'm from a large family --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and now that the summer is coming I like to go in there and load up on paper plates and the picnic tablecloths and --
R:  Oh, sure.
L:  -- different things like that and when we finally get to do these things I have 'em already --
R:  Right.
L:  -- out in the garage.
R:  I know, that you don't have to scramble or go to the store.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's one less thing.
L:  Exactly.
R:  Yeah.  I know.  They had the big things of, um [LIPSMACK] -- the paper plates I know -- or the foam plates and we always are having things at work, you know, we celebrate everybody's birthday and stuff --
L:  Right.
R:  -- and you just take in, you know, a bag of those and, um --
L:  That's right.
R:  -- I know our grocery store gives away -- like if you buy twenty dollars worth they have some free items --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- every week and like this week was napkins, you know?  [LAUGH]
L:  Oh, okay.  [LAUGH]
R:  So -- so, we have our -- all the --
L:  [COUGH]
R:  -- May birthdays have their get together tomorrow.
L:  Mhm.
R:  So, we -- and I'm on of the May birthdays.  So, we're all, you know --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- bringing things in for lunch.
L:  Yeah.
R:  So -- so, that works out nice.
L:  Oh, that's great.
R:  Yeah.
L:  That is great.
R:  So ...
L:  Well, what kind of hobbies do you like?
R:  Pardon me?
L:  What kinda hobbies do you do?
R:  Well, I like with the dogs and I used to do a lotta kinda cross stitch --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- um, but, you know, once I had my twins that kinda went out the -- the window.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I can understand that.  [LAUGH]
R:  And, um, so I -- I like to read if I can get a -- a little bit, you know, in.  My son -- I have a son that has autism.  So, he -- he demands a lotta my time too --
L:  Mhm.  Mhm.
R:  -- um, he's very high functioning, which I'm blessed, um --
L:  Okay.
R:  -- but still we have a lot of support meetings and extra things that come along with that, more meetings with school and ...
L:  You sound like me with the, um -- both my grands- --
