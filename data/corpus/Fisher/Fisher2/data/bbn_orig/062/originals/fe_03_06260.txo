R:  Yes, I can hear you.
L:  Oh, okay, 'cause I -- I, ah --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- you're --
R:  Now you're --
L:  -- kind of --
R:  No, it's okay.  Um --
L:  [MN]
R:  -- I -- I think that's what they're checking out is to see how, um, how -- how do cell phones work. 
L:  Oh, oh. 
R:  I think that's what this is about.  So ...
L:  [MN] I'm in a area that -- I really can't use my cell phone unless I'm out of my area. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay --
L:  Yeah, it's --
R:  -- I know how that goes. 
L:  Mine breaks up a lot too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, ah --
R:  Yeah, I, um, I'm [MN] just on the edge of the zone here, so I think --
L:  Ah.
R:  -- that's part of it too.  So --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- um, yeah, I like to quilt --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- and, um, have made, um, wall hangings and quilts and -- and I have lots of projects in the sewing room. 
L:  Have you?  It -- oh, I -- I've always admired that, but my hands just --
R:  [NOISE]
L:  -- I've had carpel tunnel --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- and --
R:  -- yeah.
L:  -- I just [MN] -- even crocheting -- now I could continue to knit, but crocheting was very hard. 
R:  Oh, is it because --
L:  I -- and --
R:  -- it's too fine?
L:  Yeah, I think it -- and the -- the needle --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- work --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- is, um --
R:  Now, you said you live on Cape Cod.
L:  Mhm, mhm.  Yeah, I --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- um, wor- wor- -- 
R:  Do you have any movie stars in your neighborhood?
L:  Mm, no, there -- they -- they go more towards Martha's Vineyard. [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, okay. 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Okay.  I was in Massachussetts last fall, but we didn't make it to Cape Cod, so ...
L:  Oh.
R:  We went to the, um, [LIPSMACK] western part of M- -- of Massachussetts, so, um, we just didn't get there, so, but it's a beautiful state. 
L:  It is, it is.  I -- I really like it.  I -- I originally came from Southern California.
R:  Oh.
L:  Yeah, and --
R:  That's a difference, yes.
L:  It -- it's a difference, but it -- Cape Cod, I guess if you're gonna move anywhere on the East Coast, it's -- it's pretty good.  It doesn't get too humid in the summertime and it's still moderate in the wintertime.  It --
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  -- we had a bad winter this winter, but it's the worst I, you know, ever --
R:  Oh --
L:  -- have seen it. 
R:  -- okay.  Oh.
L:  But usually we don't get much snow, you know.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  It'll rain and -- and stuff but it doesn't get too cold.  I think it's 'cause we stick out there in the ocean, you know. 
R:  Oh, okay, yeah --
L:  We --
R:  -- that makes a difference.
L:  And the we- -- with the water it kind of ke- keeps us more tempered, you know.
R:  Oh.
L:  Um --
R:  Okay. 
L:  And --
R:  I -- so how long have you lived there, then?
L:  Since ninety five. 
R:  Oh, well that's --
L:  Since ninety five.
R:  -- you -- you're used to the weather then.
L:  Yes, yeah, I've -- I've gotten used, but like I said, this is -- well, this is the worst winter that we've really had since I've lived here. 
R:  Oh.
L:  Ah, most people say that it's about the worst they've -- they've experienced and, you know --
R:  [MN] Uh-huh, a long time then.
L:  All over, yeah.
R:  Oh, huh.
L:  And, ah [SIGH] --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- but, um --
R:  Well, that's good.

R:  Um, I --
L:  -- like that?
R:  -- did when I was just a child.  I was in [inaudible] --
L:  Uh-huh.

L:  Oh.
R:  -- into it and --
L:  That's nice.
R:  Yes, yes.
