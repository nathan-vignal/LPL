L:  Hi.  My name is Sarah.
R:  Hi, Sarah.  My name is Chris.
L:  Hi, Chris.
R:  What is your hobby?
L:  Um, basically it's saving.  I try so hard to just, um, try to save as much as I can.
R:  Uh-huh.  So, I guess that's why you're doing this, right?
L:  Absolutely.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I've got a very large family.  So, any free time I have is basically just trying to make the dollars stretch further.
R:  Oh, well, could I ask you about your family then?
L:  Sure.  Absolutely.  What do you wanna know?
R:  Well, you said you have a big family.
L:  Okay.  I've got seven kids.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Ten and under.
R:  Oh, my gosh!
L:  Yeah.  So, it keeps me busy.
R:  That is wild!
L:  So, I don't -- I don't have any of those extra curricula hobbies that I can spend a lotta time doing.  But, um, any free time I have that's what I try to do.
R:  Um, so -- so what else do you do to try to save?
L:  To try to?  I'm sorry?
R:  What other -- what other are your -- your savings tricks?
L:  Um, let's see.  Getting things on sale.  I go online a lot.  I go on the Internet and I try to save money that way, um, use a lotta coupons to try to make things go further.
R:  What, um -- so, what sites do you use on the Internet to help you?
L:  Oh, gosh!  There's so many.  Just different shopping sites, different forums where people post deals that they've found --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- um, ways to try to get, um, things, you know, that I can't usually afford for my kids.  That it makes it a little bit easier --
R:  Right.
L:  -- to be able to do that.  How 'bout yourself?
R:  Well, I'm -- I'm just tot- totally the opposite from you.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I have one child.
L:  Oh, that's so nice.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  But you give 'em a lot of attention that way though.
R:  Well, yes.  She's eight --
L:  Yeah.  That's nice.
R:  -- and she's just finishing second grade.
L:  Uh-huh.  I've got a second grader too.  He's seven.
R:  Well, I figured you must have one in there somewhere.
L:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do.  Yeah.
R:  And, uh ...
L:  Well, that's really good.
R:  So, you know, we're all excited about ending -- school ends real early where I'm at, I'm in North Carolina.
L:  Okay.  I'm out in California.
R:  And, uh, we get [SIGH] -- well, our school -- her -- this is her last week of school --
L:  Oh, wow!  That's real early.
R:  -- um, but they go back, um, early in August.
L:  Okay.  Right.
R:  So, um ...
L:  Right.
R:  [LIPSMACK] So ...
L:  Well, that's ...  You know, I used to be that way where I used to just love summer vacation.  Now I don't.
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just -- I look forward to the -- to the fall when they go back to school.
R:  Well, it must be so hard to come up with things, um, to do --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- all the time to keep everybody --
L:  To keep 'em occupied too.
R:  -- occupied.
L:  Right.  Yeah.
R:  Instead of, you know -- you -- instead of sitting in front of a T.V.
L:  They're never bored though.  Mhm.  Yeah.  They're never bored.  They kinda entertain themselves too.
R:  Well, I -- I guess, yeah, you've always got someone to play with.
L:  Mhm.  That's right.  That's true.  Yeah.  How 'bout your hobbies?
R:  [LIPSMACK] Um, well, my --
L:  What do you like doing?
R:  -- main hobby I suppose is gardening.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  Um, I just finished, um, getting -- I went through a master gardener class --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- with the, um, state -- you know, the North Carolina state has, uh, like a cooperative extension --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so, I, um, got all my training in to be master gardener and now I just have to do, um, community service, uh --
L:  Wonderful.
R:  -- to -- to get my certification.
L:  Uh-huh.  That's sounds great.
R:  And I do all the gardening up at, um -- volunteer to do all the gardening up at my daughter's school.
L:  Oh, that's wonderful.
R:  So, that's been really fun because, you know, I'm up at the school --
L:  And does she like to do that with you?
R:  -- but I'm not with the people all the time --
L:  Right.
R:  -- but I just -- just get to watch and -- and --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and be outside and everything.
L:  Does your daughter enjoy that too?  Does she like to do that?
R:  Oh, well, she -- she does.
L:  Yeah?
R:  We have, um [LIPSMACK], a little garden that we planted together this year with --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- sugar snap peas and lettuce and all --
L:  Oh, wonderful!
R:  -- and the, uh, sugar snap peas ...
L:  It's such a wonderful learning experience for them too.
R:  It is.  But it's so funny because the sugar snap peas never make it in the house.  We just stand out there [LAUGH] and eat 'em.
L:  Right there and just get 'em right away, right -- right fresh from the garden.
R:  Oh, they're so good like that.
L:  Oh, yeah.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  We used to do a lotta gardening before my husband had more free time.  I just loved it 'cause he'd bring everything in fresh.
R:  Right.
L:  Make your own salads right away.
R:  Yeah.
L:  It was wonderful.
R:  Yeah.  It really does make a difference.
L:  Absolutely.  Well, that's really good.
R:  And ...
L:  'Cause now that I think about it my hobby actually is I love to cook.
R:  Oh, good.
L:  I mean, 'cause I'm constantly cooking too and baking more.  My kids love sweets and my husband loves sweets.  I'm always making desserts also.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  I do that too.  So --
R:  Oh, that's right.  Do you ...?
L:  -- you've gotta constantly feed 'em, yeah.
R:  You do it like at night or just whenever you have free time or ...?
L:  Yeah, mostly at night.  Absolutely.  That's -- after I put 'em all to sleep that's when I do all the housework and I usually try to cook something, you know, quick for them the next morning or lunch time and then whatever chance I have in between I cook again for dinner.
R:  I've heard a lotta people tell me that they do baking for relaxation, you know --
L:  Mm.
R:  -- at night it's kinda like their wind down thing.
L:  Their wind down time.  Right.
R:  Mhm.
L:  'Cause I can actually get in the kitchen and come out, you know, a meal within half an hour.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Whereas during the day it might take me two, three hours just because I have so many interruptions.
R:  Right.
L:  So ...
R:  Well, this is probably the longest uninterrupted conversation you've had in ...  [LAUGH]
L:  Absolutely.  Well, when I heard -- when I heard the phone go I said, "Yeah, I'm gonna accept this.  I'm just gonna run upstairs and you guys do whatever you gotta do and ...?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  I just fed my baby and I said, "I'm just gonna come up upstairs" and yes, absolutely --
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  -- I just -- I miss having adult conversations.
R:  I know.
L:  This is wonderful.
R:  It's so funny that's -- it's like the first couple of years I just remember just never finishing a conversation.
L:  Yeah.  That's absolutely true.
R:  You know, even in the bathroom you'd be screaming something out.  [LAUGH]
L:  That's right.  They find you.
R:  You just never finish anything.
L:  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.
R:  So, well, I just can't imagine how you do it.  That is really -- wow!  That's ...
L:  I -- I give a lotta responsibility to my younger -- my older kids too.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  They help out a lot too.  So, that helps.
R:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I'm sure they would have to.
L:  I kinda put on them too, but it's not too bad.  You know, once they get older it'll be a lot easier.
R:  Yeah.  But do you -- do you go places, the whole family together?
L:  We do.  I have no choice.  I have to.  Yeah.  We kinda -- you know, it's like you don't know it any other way.  So, you gotta keep on living.  You can't just stop.  So, everything takes us a lot longer [LAUGH] to do everything.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  But we do and because I'm so strict with coupons so whenever I do shopping it does take about two, two and a half hours --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- for grocery shopping.
R:  Wow!
L:  You know, my husband he'll go in and twenty minutes he's back with all these bags of groceries 'cause, you know, his bottom line is just bring food home to the family.
R:  Right.
L:  I'm just trying to make it last a little bit longer.
R:  Right.
L:  But it's not too bad.
R:  Do you go to one specific store or do you go to whoever has sales or ...?
L:  I used to do that.  Now I just go to one specific and only because it's closer --
R:  Right.
L:  -- because I have -- I've got, um -- my last three babies all came eleven months apart.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, they're still really tiny.  So, they all stay in the cart.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, basically I've got one and a half carts of babies and then food in like one and then in another one --
R:  Oh, my!
L:  -- that my kids push.
R:  Wow!
L:  Yeah.  We gotta do it that way too, but it's all good.  It's all right.  It's just --
R:  That is ...
L:  -- until they get a little bit older and you're walking on their own.
R:  They too young to be chasing them then up and down the aisles?
L:  Yeah.  I know.  You're absolutely right.  I mean, it's a lot easier that they're there 'cause you know they stay put until they walk.
R:  So, this is my first phone call.  Have you ...?
L:  Me too.  Nope.  This is my first one.
R:  Um ...
L:  This is the first one I did too.  So, yeah.
R:  I figured, you know, hey, what a -- what a good quick way to make ten dollars and ...
L:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I just found out about this I think last week.  So, I thought oh, this would be great and give me a chance to -- like you said ...
R:  Well, I just got the email on it today.  So, I'm surprised.  You know, I sent it in a couple of days ago.
L:  I did too.  I got an email today.
R:  Yeah.
L:  I got an email today, yeah.
R:  And then it's like ...
L:  Someone had posted it I think last week and I had to write a [MN] -- someone had like a referral or something and I said oh, this sounds interesting.  So --
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  -- said I've give it a try and it was wonderful.  So, yeah, I don't know how it works after this, but ...
R:  Um, I guess they just keep calling ya until ya get three phone calls then.
L:  I like -- yeah -- and I like the fact that you get to pick and choose 'cause I was afraid that, you know, the times I put might not work for me.
R:  Right.
L:  But then they did say you can decline if you don't want to.  So ...
R:  Is it -- you know what?  I didn't answer the phone.  So, I didn't even hear the first part of the message or anything.  You know, my daughter just hands me the phone and I'm thinking, you know, what is this?  [LAUGH]  I heard press three or press two and ...
L:  Oh, so -- oh, and then she handed it over to you?
R:  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah, I think -- yeah, it starts off saying that they're -- they're Fisher and that they, um -- I guess, um -- if -- if you're free, if you wanna take the call press one or something like that --
R:  Okay.
L:  -- and go after that too.  So, yeah, it should be interesting to see.  But I didn't realize 'til now that you only do three of 'em.
R:  Well, I think that's what they said.  You do -- you can do three and then --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- and then they put you in some type of a lottery.
L:  I read something about a lottery and something about mail.
R:  Yeah.  For every one you complete you get put in a lottery --
L:  I see.
R:  -- and get the chance to do like twenty five more.
L:  Mm.
R:  So ...
L:  Oh, to do twenty five more.  Oh, I didn't know that.
R:  Yeah.  Or -- or something like that, if you get the lot- -- if you win the lottery [LAUGH] --
L:  I see, yeah.
R:  -- then you get to do --
L:  The chances of that!  Yeah.
R:  -- more phone calls.
L:  I see, yeah.
R:  Um ...
L:  Well, you know, it's not much, but it -- it is something, you know, every little bit helps.  So ...
R:  Oh, yeah, I think it's great.
L:  Yeah.
R:  I -- you know, um -- you know, I'm lucky that I don't have to pinch pennies a whole lot, but --
L:  Well, that's good.
R:  -- I do, you know, and -- and stuff like this and ...
L:  I think everybody does.  Yeah.  Everyone does this to kinda -- in case it's just it's really tough.  So, North Carolina is so expensive.
R:  Oh, I can't even imagine.  Um, we -- my daughter and I -- I always wanted to go to San Francisco, it's been like my number one place in the world I wanted to go.
L:  I've never been there yet.  My husband keeps telling me how beautiful it is.  I'd like to see it.
R:  It is so beautiful.
L:  Yeah?
R:  But it was so expensive and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I've heard the cost of living of houses and everything is outrageous.
L:  Yeah.  I think San Diego might be tied with San Francisco.  I don't know if it's just as expensive or not, but it is.  I can tell you it's a lot more expensive than Los Angeles and LA's very pricey too.  So, I think ...
R:  Do you live in a, um -- an urban type area or ...?
L:  We live in a -- a suburb of -- of San Diego.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  But still it is, it's -- yeah, it's north of the city --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and, um, it is, I think you're mostly paying for the scenery and the nice weather --
R:  Right.
L:  -- more than anything else too.
R:  Um ...
L:  I lived on the east coast in Florida for a year and a half.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  So, I kinda got a taste of what the east coast was like and --
R:  Is it?
L:  -- it's completely different.
R:  Completely different?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Well, now, San Francisco I think was so unique in area --
L:  Right.
R:  -- um, that I -- I can't -- don't feel like I can judge --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um, anything by it.
L:  Right.  And San Francis- -- Northern California is also so different than Southern California.
R:  Uh-huh.
L:  Completely different way of life.
