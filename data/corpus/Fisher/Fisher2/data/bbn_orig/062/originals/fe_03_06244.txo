R:  Hello?
L:  Hi.  This is Rebecca.
R:  Hi, Rebecca.  I'm Barb.
L:  Hi, Barb.
R:  And where are you?
L:  I'm in Everett, Washington.
R:  Oh, okay.
L:  Where are you?
R:  Um, in Laverne, California, just, um --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- east of Pasadena.
L:  Oh, okay.  Oh, Pasadena.  I love Pasadena.  [LAUGH]
R:  I know.  Everybody's like -- well, everybody knows Pasadena from the rose parade.  So, I always use that as my frame of reference.
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Twenty minutes east of Pasadena.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  So ...
L:  My husband and I took a trip last summer --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- um, sort of an anniversary trip and we went to Pasadena.  That was one of the places that we stopped and oh, gosh, we both said if we could retire right now that's where we would retire.  [LAUGH]
R:  Oh, well, its stinking hot today I'll tell you.  [LAUGH]  It's over ninety and it's muggy and I'm not looking forward to summer.  So --
L:  Oh.
R:  -- that's one you guys don't have is you don't have the smog like we do.
L:  That's true.
R:  So ...
L:  That's true.
R:  Well [SIGH], do you have a hobby?
L:  I have lots of hobbies, but I think the hobby that I spend most of the time on is computers.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I love playing on the computer.
R:  And so --
L:  How 'bout you?
R:  -- what do you do on the computer, like play games and chat and research, or what do you do?
L:  Yeah.  I -- I do just about everything.  I do, um, some work on -- on the computer.  I play games.  I keep, you know, in touch with family members and -- and old friends that way, um, research a lot.  I've got two teenagers.  So, you know, we're always doing something on the computer.
R:  I guess I never think of my computer time as a hobby.  I -- but it could be and that's probably really a valid hobby and I haven't ever looked at it that way, um --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- it's just kind of, um -- hm.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  That's -- I know.  I'm just like oh, wow, huh, that doesn't count in my mind.  [LAUGH]
L:  Well, you know -- and I -- I think that it wouldn't count normally because most people don't use the -- well, back in the old days people didn't use the computers except to do work.
R:  No.  But it is.  I mean, it's my connection with, you know, friends and family out of the state especially or -- I have a buddy that -- you know, about an hour and a half away and interstate calls are so expensive, it's so silly, and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- so we -- you know, we chit chat back and forth and, I mean, it just, um -- well, it is like -- I guess it is a hobby 'cause I look for bargains online and, um --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- um -- hm -- well, there you go.
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  I just learned something in here, not just, huh -- I'm a reader.  I love to read.  I really do love it and so I guess that's what I think of more as my hobby than, um, anything else, um ...
L:  Yeah.
R:  At our former church they got to do a library and it was just the most fun, it was just so fun, and so, um, there are just so many books out there and it's just -- I mean, I'll go to Barnes and Noble and I make a list and then I go to the library and order all the books that I wanna read [LAUGH] --
L:  I hear ya.
R:  -- and then that way you don't feel like you have to buy 'em all.  But, you know, you can pick and choose on bestsellers and you know some, ya wanna read and some ya think yeah, that's -- that's not my taste or, you know ...?
L:  [MN] Yeah.
R:  Are you a reader?
L:  I love to read, um, but I'm going to school right now --
R:  Oh, wow!
L:  -- trying to finish my degree and, um, working fulltime as well --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- and I don't have time to read anymore because I'm always reading ...
R:  And two teenagers.
L:  Yeah.  Because I'm always reading textbooks.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  So --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- um, computers really for me are the way that I can shut down, block out, you know, my schoolwork and -- and other stuff and I work in an elementary school as well.  So, um, which is kinda funny.  You say you worked in the library.  That's part of my day is --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- is in the school library.  So --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- I'm around books all the time.  I just have no time to read them.  [LAUGH]
R:  To read 'em.  Well, and, you know, it's funny because, um, I home school my girls and neither one of my girls are readers --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- maybe they will be when they grow up but, uh, we have different -- that the kids just [inaudible] and like Barb, you've got the wrong kid.  You've just [LAUGH] -- and we laugh and the girls are like, "Mom, that's not funny" and so -- but they're just not readers and, um --
L:  Yes.
R:  -- it's -- and -- but my husband isn't a reader, um, especially -- well, he'll read, um, like he's into cycling and so he'll read, you know, something specific, but he's not read for pleasure kinda person.
L:  Mhm.
R:  And so, um, my Mom and my Dad were both readers, um, my Mom wasn't so much growing up because she had -- she was working fulltime, but my Dad was home, um, he was disabled and so he was home.  So, I think that kinda, you know, added to, you know, my interest in that.  I used to do more things.  I used to do oh, cross stitch and, you know, more decorating and I was part of a craft store, um, when all the country crafts first came out --
L:  Uh-huh.
R:  -- and so that was kind of a hobby.  But when that started to recede just a little bit I got out 'cause I thought you're not making a whole bunch of money at this anyway and the competition just got too fierce and then people started to kinda wane on their interest.  So, for me it was kind of a hobby and a job.
L:  Right.
R:  So ...  But now I'm not a big crafter either.  So, we just moved and, um, we have, um, a house that has, um, potential for more plants and so I'm thinking we'll just do a little more gardening, maybe I'll do that this year.
L:  Very nice.  That gets you outside and --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- you know?
R:  We --
L:  That's nice.
R:  -- we have a little ledge out, um, kind of a block wall with just a little separation between us and our neighbor there's a little dirt in there.  My daughter's got little flowers growing in there and it's such a crack up because she looks out her window and she sees little flowers in the wall -- you know, ledge between the wall and the wall.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]
R:  I said, "Oh, you're just so creative, Vanessa".  She goes, "That's -- that's one of the advantages of home schooling, Mom, you're in your room a lot" --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- and I said, "Well.  So ..."
L:  Well, I love to garden as well, um ...
R:  Oh.  Well, up there you guys you have -- do you start now?
L:  Oh, yes.
R:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.
L:  Yeah.  And gardening up here can be very fruitful, um --
R:  [MN]
L:  -- because we have such mild weather --
R:  Yeah.
L:  -- you know, um, and we definitely get enough rain.  So, we don't have to water the plants, uh, very often.  [LAUGH]
R:  Mhm.
L:  Um [LIPSMACK], so, yeah, I love -- I -- I -- I would like to say I spend about twenty hours a week on my, um -- on my hobbies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I just don't know how accurate that is.
R:  Well, especially with, um, school right now, you know --
L:  Mhm.
R:  -- that has to play a big part.  Well, one of their questions was, do you think everybody should have a hobby?  I think it's up to people, you know, they're all grown up, they can make their own decisions.  [LAUGH]
L:  Yeah.  I -- my husband does not hobbies --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and his Dad is an incredible woodworker.
R:  Mm.
L:  His Mom is -- she's -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say she has any hobbies either.  She doesn't like to do crafting stuff and she golfs, but I don't really look at golf as -- as a hobby because she's retired, you know, she could pretty much do anything she wants, but she doesn't really do anything.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, um ...
R:  Does she watch T.V.?
L:  No.  She's not a T.V. watcher either.
R:  What does she do all day?
L:  [MN] Sit around -- sit around and flip through magazines or talk to other people.  Maybe socializing --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- is her hobby.
R:  Mhm.
L:  I guess that makes sense.  But my husband doesn't have any hobbies and he is the most, um, hard to buy for person because you can't -- you know, there's nothing that he likes to collect --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- there's nothing that he really shows interest in, um [LIPSMACK], on top of the fact that he is just so, uh -- he doesn't have any focus, he doesn't have any direction.
R:  Mm.
L:  So, I think hobbies are -- are necessary.
R:  Mm.  Well, I guess I haven't looked at it that way.
L:  Yeah.  I mean, think about it, when you get a little extra time, when you have some spare time, what do you like to do?  You go do one of your hobbies.
R:  Mhm.
L:  If you don't have any hobbies what do you do?
R:  Yeah.  Well, there's always something to do.  That's the thing, I feel like I field time for my reading, you know, I -- I field time away from something else that I probably should be really devoting myself to.  [LAUGH]
L:  [LAUGH]
R:  [MN] Like with this move, I have to be really cautious because we still have things that aren't unpacked or, you know, need -- oh, bathrooms painted and, you know, these kinda things, but I haven't broken that down into doable little pieces yet and so I -- I -- I -- it's kinda overwhelming and so then I can sneak away and do something, you know, for ten minutes, you can go research on this.  Well, if you paint your bathroom it takes a lot longer than ten minutes.  [LAUGH]
L:  Sure.
R:  So, I -- we keep trying to figure out -- okay, we did so much work on the house before we moved in and houses are so expensive down here right now.  I mean, it's just such a crazy thing and so, um, we were really, really blessed to be able to --
