R:  Hi, this is Robyn.
L:  Hi, my name's Aleisha.
R:  Hi, Aleisha, how are you?
L:  Fine.  And you?
R:  I'm fine, thank you.  Where am I calling to?  Where are you located?
L:  Uh, Woodward, Oklahoma.  
R:  Oh, I'm in Los Angeles.  How's the weather?
L:  Actually, it's really nice.  It's no longer raining and it's just really pretty.
R:  [LAUGH]  Great.  So, what is your favorite hobby?
L:  Um, well, I do lot of refunding and stuff and I also, uh, I cover, like, wine glasses and stuff with polymer clay.
R:  Really?
L:  Yeah.
R:  That sounds interesting.  How do you do that?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  Um, you just make like the -- you just take it and mix it up and make canes and stuff and then stretch it over the -- the stuff -- the, uh, glasses or whatever you're covering.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And I'm doing it because I'm in a medieval society and we have a medieval fair every year and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so I thought, well, I'll sell 'em next year at the medieval fair.  And then -- cause there's [MN] -- you know, renaissance and medieval stuff.  People always buy stuff like that so ...
R:  Oh, that sounds great.  How long have you been doing that?
L:  Uh, for a couple of months now, actually.  [LAUGH]  It's a new hobby.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You just got into a new hobby.  What was your hobby before that?
L:  Um, reading mainly.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Reading?  What kind of books do you like to read?
L:  Romance.  
R:  Romance.  Who's your favorite?
L:  [SIGH]  Oh, I have so many of 'em.  Um --
R:  I know.
L:  Jane Anne Krentz, Katherine Coulter, Nora Roberts, uh, Suzanne Brockman.  
R:  Wow , all of the biggies.
L:  Yeah, well in some -- yeah -- yeah and some of the little ones, you know.  Like Kate London and things like that.  
R:  Mhm.  Sounds fascinating.  Do you have any other hobbies?
L:  No, [LAUGH] I don't.
R:  No other hobbies!
L:  No.  
R:  Are you kidding, Aleisha?  Nothing at all?
L:  No.  Nothing at all.
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I like films myself.  I mean, that's my passion, watching films and writing films.  So that is my main hobby.  But I don't like any films.  I like certain films that are shot well, written well, etcetera, etcetera.  Do you have any favorite films?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  Oh, yeah.  Lord of the Rings.  You know.
R:  You like Lord of the Rings?
L:  Oh, yeah.
R:  Yes.  That has a medieval tang to it.  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Um, [MN] ...
R:  And Harry Potter?
L:  Harry Potter, you know.  Harry Potter.
R:  Mhm.
L:  Uh, [LIPSMACK]  Kismet, from the nineteen fifties.  The -- the musical.
R:  Yes, I just saw that in the video store.  
L:  Yeah.
R:  Who's -- who's in that one?
L:  Um, it's Howard Keel.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And, uh, [MN] what's her name?  Anne -- [MN]
R:  Ann Margaret?
L:  No, it's like Anne Bancroft or someone like that.
R:  Oh, really?  Oh.
L:  And, uh, I'm not sure if it's her but, uh, and Vic Damone.  
R:  Vic Damone.  Yeah.
L:  Vic Damone is in there.  
R:  Was [several inaudible words].
L:  It's -- it's really good.
R:  It's a musical isn't it?  
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Kismet.  About fate.  What do you think about kismet in general?
L:  [LIPSMACK]  [SIGH]  [MN]
R:  Do you believe in fate?
L:  Sure.  I mean, you know, f- -- I think everyone does to an extent.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  But ...
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.  As much as they have to, huh?
L:  Yeah.  
R:  So how much time do you spend doing your hobby?
L:  Uh, well I work twelve hours a day so, um, just pretty much whenever I have a chance to outside of, you know, housework and stuff.
R:  What kind of work do you do?
L:  I work in the emergency room at the local hospital, um, doing -- registering patients.
R:  Oh, that's probably very stressful working in the emergency room.
L:  Not really because it's a -- we -- I live in a small town so --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- we really don't have -- it's really not that bad.  
R:  It's not like ER 
L:  [MN]
R:  -- is it?
L:  No.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, it's nothing like ER.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Well, I know ER is quite exaggerated.  I could see, you know, where it's exaggerated.
L:  Yeah, well --
R:  But [MN] --
L:  -- I'm sure -- I'm sure in bigger cities like Los Angeles, and stuff, I could probably see it but --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- in small towns, you know, we rarely get -- I don't even remember the last shooting we had [LAUGH] or stabbing --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- or anything so ...  I mean --
R:  That must be pretty cool.
L:  Yeah, we just -- we have mainly car accidents and stuff.  So, I mean, it's -- or actually mainly the majority we have is, you know, sick people that's -- you know, their -- their kids have been sick for three weeks or they've been sick for three weeks and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- so, you know ...
R:  [LAUGH]  Let's see that's ...  So it's pretty mellow out in Oklahoma, O.K. huh?
L:  Yeah.
R:  Have you seen the play, Oklahoma?
L:  Yeah.  Actually I was in it in high school.  [LAUGH] 
R:  You were in the play?  Does everyone --
L:  I [LAUGH] was --
R:  -- in Oklahoma have to be in the Oklahoma play?
L:  I don't know.  It's just --
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  That's what we did one year when I was in high school.  My senior --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- year for choir we ended up doing Oklahoma because --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- it was the fiftieth anniversary at that time so ...
R:  Oh.  I see.  
L:  So that's why we had to do it then.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oklahoma, O.K.  
L:  Yeah.  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH]  What -- what else do we have to talk about for hobbies?  I only have those two questions.  Did you get any of the other question?
L:  No, I think that's it.  
R:  [MN]  What are your favorite hobbies?  How much time do you spend doing your hobbies?
L:  Yeah.
R:  What other hobbies would you do if you had more time?
L:  Oh, geez.  [SIGH]  Travel.
R:  Travel.  Where do you want to go?
L:  Everywhere.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Everywhere.  
L:  It -- but it -- it's more of a thing it's -- it's not time but money. 
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  You know.  If I had --
R:  Yes.
L:  You know, if I won like the powerball or something then I'd [LAUGH] travel.  
R:  [LAUGH]  How much is your powerball, usually?
L:  We don't even have a lottery.  
R:  Oh, you don't have a lottery?  
L:  We don't even have a lottery.
R:  Oh.  Wow.  You must live in a small town, Aleisha.  Not to have a lottery.
L:  We don't have a lottery.
R:  [LAUGH]  
L:  Uh, they're trying to get it past but I doubt if it will because we have a whole bunch of Baptists that say tha- that say that we're not gonna have it, so ...
R:  Oh, the Baptists don't want you to have the lottery, huh?
L:  Yeah.  Even though we have a Baptist governor, and that's the only reason he was, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- elected.  Was he said that he -- we would get the lottery.
R:  Mhm.
L:  So if he doesn't then he's out in another couple of years.  [LAUGH] 
R:  Oh, I see.  So why don't the Baptists want the lottery?  D- do they think it's evil?
L:  Yes. 
R:  Oh.
L:  It's evil.  It has to do with Satan. [LAUGH]  [MN]
R:  Mhm.  That's a shame.
L:  Yeah, it --
R:  But I'm sure if they won it they wouldn't think that.  [LAUGH] 
L:  No, they wouldn't.  
R:  [LAUGH]  Satan.  So Satan -- if you won the lottery then you're probably a Satanist, aren't you?
L:  [MN]  Must be.  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Well, and it -- and it takes money from poor people 'cause they'll spend it and I'm like, "Well, you know --"
R:  Mhm.
L:  "-- they're on medicaid, they already have my money", so ...
R:  Mhm.
L:  [LAUGH]  That they're using for --
R:  Exactly.
L:  -- +drugs.  You know, for drugs and drink so, you know, a dollar for a lottery ticket isn't gonna kill 'em.  [LAUGH]  So ...
R:  I know.  It's -- it's -- it's -- it's interesting hearing that coming from a big town like Los Angeles.
L:  Yeah.
R:  It's amazing [MN] everyone is not like that in Los Angeles.  
L:  No.
R:  We have everything.  Crime, emergency room sta- statistics.  Everything.  So I -- I travelled to England a couple of years ago and it was fabulous.  So I do like travelling as a hobby, if I can.  I want to go to Florence, Italy, next.  But you should definitely travel if time permits and --
L:  Yeah.
R:  -- money and everything else.  'Cause you never know where you are until you go out of your own backyard.  
L:  Yeah.  Um, well, every once in a while I'll, uh -- Romantic Times magazine?
R:  Mhm.
L:  Every year they will have a Romantic Times Book Lovers convention in --
R:  Oh.
L:  -- different places --
R:  Really?
L:  -- across the --
R:  Mhm.
L:  They had a -- they had it Reno last year and they're having it in Kansas City this year.  
R:  Mhm.
L:  And they've had it in, uh, Houston, Toronto and Orlando.  
R:  Oh.
L:  And this is like the twentieth year of it so, I mean, they've had it all over the place and --
R:  Well, that's good.
L:  Yeah, and I went to Reno last year.  I went to the Houston one a couple of years ago and I went to Reno last year.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And you get to meet all your -- you know, a whole bunch of your favorite authors and stuff.  And -- and I -- the -- the cover models.  The male cover models and -- and, uh, they have a -- a cover model contest for men and -- and a --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- [MN].  It's Mr Romance and stuff and -- and it's a lot of fun because it's like, uh, five days.
R:  Mhm.
L:  And there's, um, they have, um -- oh, they have dinners and breakfasts and, you know --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- just different things where you can dress up and -- and everything, and it's a lot of fun 'cause you get to meet a lot of new people.  And I know one year -- the first year I went in Houston I met a screen write- -- two screen writers and a -- and a film producer.
R:  Oh, that's good.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  Excellent.
L:  And, uh --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  [LAUGH]  
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And that was including all the -- all the other famous, uh, romance authors and stuff and --
R:  Mhm.  Mhm.
L:  And it was just a lot of fun.
R:  Did you see a lot of Fabio wannabes?
L:  Uh --
R:  [LAUGH]  Or did he just disappear?  He -- he disappeared now I think.  
L:  Well, I think he's still doing stuff 'cause I just saw him --
R:  Is he?
L:  -- on VH One on something the o- -- last night.
R:  Oh, really?
L:  But -- yeah.  
R:  Oh.
L:  He was talking about bad hair or something.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  And he was one of the -- he was one of the people that was talking about bad hair and -- and things.
R:  Oh.
L:  And, um, but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- actually the cover mod- -- the male cover models, they're all really nice and --
R:  Mhm.
L:  -- and -- and they don't [LAUGH] really look like Fabio but --
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  -- uh, they're all very gorgeous.  [LAUGH]  Or else --
R:  Yes.
L:  -- they wouldn't be cover models.
R:  They [MN] --
L:  But they're real sweet and stuff and -- and, you know, you get to talk to them and -- and everything, so ...
R:  That's nice.  You had a good experience.
L:  Yeah.  
R:  That's probably --
L:  So --
R:  -- why you like reading romance novels, isn't it?
L:  Yeah.  Ca- cause now I [MN] -- cause now I know the guys names on the covers of [LAUGH] books.
R:  [LAUGH]  Oh, really?  
L:  Yeah.
R:  [LAUGH] 
L:  Most of them --
R:  Wow.
L:  -- I'm going, "Oh, yeah, that's [MN] -- you know, that's him" and everything and -- and
